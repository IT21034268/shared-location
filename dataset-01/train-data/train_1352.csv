4,A must read for marketing professionals,"Every facet of marketing needs to be: A) constantly measured and B) always subject to the question ""why."" The ""why"" is the biggest takeaway from Freakonomics. It reminded me of the importance of really understanding what is being presented in the numbers. Just don't take numbers at face value, but really try to understand their hidden meaning.I found Freakonomics to be an easy read that touched on the very essence why thoughtful, meticulous and open-minded consideration of the facts is paramount to any business trying to succeed.You can check out a more detailed review as well as other book reviews and [...]"
3,"Good, but not great","While the book was interesting and definitely makes you think differently about facts and figures, I was a bit dissapointed by the lack of topics covered in the book. The ""hidden side of everything"" was really only five or six topics at best. That said, it was interesting, but I just wish there were more guts to the book."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because of the 'hype' surrounding it.This book has no point, has been dumbed down for the uneducated reader and doesn't spend any time on the details of the economic analysis.It's ironic that a book that advocates questioning conventional wisdom, that I bought because of this very 'wisdom', was so terrible.Serves me right I guess. :)"
3,"Interesting, but not what I expected","I received this book as a Christmas gift and was intrigued by the title. However, after reading the book I was disappointed. The theories put forth in the book are interesting, some more than others. What was the most fascinating was how Levitt brings together seemingly disparate ideas, such as crime and abortion, but as the book itself describes, data can be used and interpreted in any number of ways. As one reviewer wrote, it seems like we should ooh and aah at everything. I was more inclined to come up with flaws in the argument. I guess when I saw the cover I should have been forewarned. It is in garish colors, that should have told me everything."
4,Could it be True?,This book really makes you think about different things in life and how we may have gotten to the final destination. Malcom Gladwell is a very interesting and creative writer.
5,Socio-Economics,"Excellently written!Goes a long way in validating ""my"" hypothesis that things are not what they seem despite what the initial facts may say! The the hard work done by Prof.Levitt clearly demonstrates my hypothesis with empirical evidence that sometimes what is clearly evident even with hard core statistical data may not really be the source or core of the issue at hand!Goes to reinforce the growing yet still a tiny minority of folks who promote the notion that we have to get away from finding quick and immediate fixes for various issues, but invest some time and effort to create a holistic approach to tackle pressing systemic issues"
4,Interesting,"Enjoyed most of the book, skipped over the parenting part as I plan to never be a parent and it bored me. Otherwise it was very interesting and a good read for cause/effect thinkers. Sometimes you have to jump though many hoops to get to the cause. Perhaps some things are a tiny bit far reaching in this book but it at least gets you thinking."
3,Read it in the Times Magazine,"Levitt's ideas are interesting and original, but the presentation is thin, with little attempt to explain methodology or to generalize beyond the individual anecdotes.For a much snappier presentation of the same material, look up the original article in the New York Times Magazine, Sunday, August 3, 2003, and the follow-up Sunday, June 6, 2004. You can probably find these at your local library, or you may have free access to the Times online archives through your library's web site."
3,"Good book, but I'm not sure if I learned anything","The books was well written, but I'm not really sure how much I've learned from it."
5,Freakonomics,"Readers, this is an interesting book. Levitt's view on the world. What is even more interesting to me are the reviews of the book. DO NOT listen to these one star raters. Unreliable. At a quick glance one will notice that the initial reviews rank this book very high. I have no respect for all these 'avid snobs', who none of us will ever hear of, aside from there frequent insults of best selling authors, trying to steer everyone away from a great piece of work. What I would steer clear of are the obscure titles in which these sky noses suggest. These are the types that take The Da Vinci Code LITERALLY. Give all of us who enjoy reading a break. Take this book for what it's worth. It might be econ, it might be soc., whatever it is, It's fun to read."
2,I was not dazzled!,"Did not live up to the hype -- certainly did not show me the ""hidden side of everything""; more like his opinions on a few things with some data to back it up. Save your money."
1,"Boring, pointless, impratical","I got this book hoping to learn things about economics that were interesting and helpful. Instead I got to learn about drug dealing and the KKK. Go read NAKED ECONOMY by Wheelan instead, MUCH better than this."
1,Only One Thing Is Clear,"Only one thing became clear while reading this book. As the author(s) put it, journalists need experts as much as experts need journalists. Levitt and Dubner proved that point very well."
5,Freakonomics,I loved this book. Each chapter was entirely different than the others. Steven Levitt definitely takes a unique approach and proves his points in a fascinating way.
3,Levitt's abortion-cut-crime theory has been debunked,"Ever since I debated Dr. Levitt in Slate in 1999 over his abortion-cut-crime theory, people have been telling me that my simpleminded little graphs and ratios of national crime trends showing that Dr. Levitt hadn't met the burden of proof couldn't possibly be right because Dr. Levitt's state-level evidence was so much more gloriously, glamorously, incomprehensibly complicated than mine, and Occam's Butterknife says that the guy with the most convoluted argument wins.Well, now we now why Dr. Levitt's abstruse state-level analysis didn't match up with my straight-forward national-level analysis: because he made two big mistakes in his work! A new paper by Foote and Goetz of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, featured in the Wall Street Journal, has shown that Levitt made two fatal errors.The rest of the book is pretty good, if you can tolerate Dr. Levitt's egomania."
2,Questionable,"An interesting idea- books that upset the apple cart are always fun, and they sell really well!Unfortunately, many of the so-called causes are questionable. The Roe v. Wade argument, for example. Might be true, but there isn't much here to back it up.Then there is the swimming-pool vs guns argument, where the author states ""Meanwhile, there is 1 child killed by a gun for every 1 million-plus guns.""This only holds true for accidental deaths. If one includes suicides and homicides amongst the under 20 crowd the numbers change dramatically from less than 200 to over 3000, and one finds that pools are indeed safer to have around than guns. Of course, pools are harder to lock up in a safe!The author states that people will cheat to gain advantage, and this does appear to be true."
2,Not much about economics,"If you like this sort of thing, more on sociology than economics, buy either of Malcolm Gladwell's book. This one will not provide you with any interesting facts to incorporate in improving your daily life, or the use of the coins in your pocket."
2,"Self-congratulatory, and really not that profound","I'll give the authors credit for the use of social science. However, simply tackling a 'controversial' subject (i.e. abortion and crime rates) does not make the conclusions that much more startling, when, in fact, any decent sociologist could take apart these arguments in an academic setting.Most of the book seems to be a testament to the authors' intelligence. After reading the book, I just can't genuflect.They do properly give credit to the researchers who have done interesting work. Its just not either of them.Arrogant"
2,Much over-hyped,"I was excited to read this book as I find alternative ways of looking at things very interesting. All I can say is I'm glad I checked this book out from the library rather than having purchased it.There is very little in this book that lives up to the billing that Mr. Levitt somehow has remarkable and unique insight into the world in which we live. For example, is it really shocking to find that a house with a swimming pool is statistically more dangerous to a child than one with a gun?Anyone with any sense of objectivity and insight will find this book to be a disappointment. There are some interesting stories about individuals who have done some extraordinary things regarding the Ku Klux Klan and drug gangs in Chicago, but these having nothing to do with the author himself."
1,Take your ego out of your writing!,"This book could have been better if not for the constant yammering about how much smarter the young author was than everyone else. Every chapter opened with some sort of praise for his intelligence and groundbreaking work.Don't get me wrong, I think it had some interesting correlations and theories, but I also felt like I didn't come away with anything. Every time someone talks about this being an economics book I want to point out you learn nothing about economics. You learn about a bunch of very specific theories (although some have been written about since this book was published like the point about a pool being more dangerous than a gun.)It's clear this book was written to appeal to the largest audience possible. Feel free to read it- it is a quick one- but also remember that if you go looking for strange correlations like these, you'll certainly find them."
3,Quick Read,"Freakonomics is written for the lay audience and perhaps that is one of the major reasons why it's so popular. Some sections were more interesting than others.This book is one of those books that will cause conversations. I didn't necessarily agree with some of their assertions or even the data sets that they were using. Why? Well, it's just too easy to use the data set that ""works"" for your hypothesis. That said, this is a good book to read while you're on vacation. You'll fly right through it and it's engaging."
2,"cocktail conversation, low on substance","this is clearly a contrarian review in light of this book's bestseller status. my hat is off to the marketers who took this book to the top. in truth, this is a collection of quasi-interesting observations on a range of topics tied together by the author's economic analysis. Other than being able to say ""I read it,"" maybe a couple anecdotes and moderate entertainment, I'm hard-pressed to say what anyone gets from this book. fodder for the uncritical mind."
2,More Hype than Content,"As an avid reader or economics I thought I was in for a treat with Freakonomics. But it was 10 cents worth of idea blown into $15. The section on names was quite boring and I couldn't wait for it to be over. Moreover whenever I see Malcom Gladwell reviewing a book, I groan, because Mr. Gadwell seems to see everthing in terms of dazzling. His hype is an insult to an intelligent person. Or even a non-intelligent person."
1,Debunked,Some of the notions that the author presents as fact in this book have been debunked. This author has no credibility any more.
4,Interesting and fun,"This book is a fun and easy read that stays with the reader. That's a nice and rare combination of ingredients. Levitt applies clear-eyed economic theory to social situations--for example, how much difference does good parenting make--with surprising results. He challenges us to ask meaningful questions and to see things not only as we wish they were, but as they really are. As Levitt freely admits, the book is a hodgepodge of different topics without a clear theme. But that's part of what makes it easy to pick up and set down without getting lost."
4,interesting....but not very useful....,"Levitt raised some very interesting questions and provide readers with answers backed up by strong data. His first few chapters were particularly thought provoking - what do sumo wrestlers and teachers have in common? why did crime rate drop substantially in the 1990s?However, I feel that his later chapters are a bit too fluffy. Data provide some interesting points but not really useful information for daily life.I have also read the tipping point. It's interesting/contradicting how in tipping point Gladwell suggests that crime rate in NYC dropped substantially because of small improvements made (such as fixing broken windows, cleaning up the subway station) whereas Levitt attributes the drop in crime rate to the legalization of abortion."
3,Freakonomics? Hardly.,"Yes, Levitt's work calls one to examine assertions more critically, to challenge ""conventional wisdom,"" and to be more analytical in drawing conclusions especially from statistics... But the book fails to deliver on the promise of its title.Freakonomics starts off pretty well, but somewhere in the middle loses its grip. One merely continues to read in hope that the book will pick up speed again. Simple points that could be conveyed in a paragraph or two are needlessly spread out over pages... especially the chapter on the statistical significance of names...Anyhow, Freakonomics is a book you'd want to borrow..."
2,"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing","The book has some interesting stories, but like what it accuses other studies of doing, fails to support the findings adequately (in my opinion). While I didn't expect a course on statistical analysis, I was expecting better supporting documentation for the arguments and at least a mid-level discussion of the methodology. This book is like a dessert--enjoyable while partaking, but does not supply any lasting benefit."
3,Got my Freakon,"I guess the application of econometric tools to issues of the day can make for some amusement but at the end they just left me a bit... well... amused. I can't say there's much in there that will cause me to change long-held beliefs but, at least, it offers some fun debating points."
2,Too light on the science,"I consider myself a layperson interested in science, but I do have a reasonable background in statistics. This book may be interesting to people completely new to that field, but if you have studied anything similar, I'd recommend you skip this book. Here's a simple test: do you know what a regression analysis is? If not, buy; if yes, don't.Many of the ideas presented here are not particularly surprising. There's a huge section claiming that houses with swimming pools are more dangerous to children than houses with guns. That may raise your eyebrows, but it's certainly not a secret that children, left unsupervised, can drown in swimming pools. That's why hotel pools are locked at night, and why during the day, they are often staffed by people called ""lifeguards"".I also found it rather bizarre that each chapter is prefaced with an excerpt heaping praise upon one of the authors, including one that describes, heaven help us all, his modesty. TA-cky."
3,"Entertaining, yet...","Frk is a light read (or listen, in my case), entertaining and marginally informative. If your interest in the field of economics runs even shallowly beneath the surface, you, like me, may find it disappointing. If Levitt is half the genius he is touted to be in this book (by his journalist/co-author), then I'm sure his scholarship makes for fascinating reading. Frk is the economist's version of a light romp, too heavy on pop journalism, too light on concepts and rigor. Also, unless I missed something, there's nothing obviously ""freaky"" about Levitt's brand of economics -- neither the mode of inquiry nor the methodology he pursues. I don't doubt he is a brilliant and innovative economist, but even so, this book in no way makes the case for ""Freakonomics"" as a field apart from traditional economics. The title strikes me as a lame (and cynical) advertising ploy. Unnecessary."
5,Very interesting read,I never thought I'd read a book about economics and be unable to put it down. This book was very enlightening and put in such a way that I was entertained while the light bulbs were going off over my head. I came away from reading this with a new perspective on why things happen the way they do.I have been telling everyone how much I enjoyed learning something about economics and highly recommend this book.
4,"Fun., thought-provoking read","The book raise some really interesting and intriguing theories (e.g., abortion rate vs crime rate) and makes you think about things differently. Although written by an economist, it's not dry at all, and the frequent stories/examples add to its accessibility.While avoiding detailed description of the methodology used keeps it reader-friendly, I think that's one potential drawback of the book - with minimal back-up as to why certain correlations are statistically valid, trained economists/statisticians may not support his findings.Of course, this book seems more tailored to the general public anyway, so that may not be a concern. In any case, it was a very interesting read!"
3,Dumbed Down Economics for Dummies,"This book is entertaining and some of the real-life stories told from an economic perspective are instructive, but there's really not much substance, and it really isn't economics - it's more like how to be a good detective. Levitt spends a lot of time analyzing the what, how, and why of cheating, crime, and poverty. These are all important issues, and economic analysis can certainly help us to understand and address them, but again, Levitt remains light and superficial. Levitt's unifying economic theory might be expressed thus: Any human activity is directly influenced by incentives and disincentives. To his credit, Levitt does illustrate that well-meaning legal and political actions can and often do have unintended consequences, some good and some bad. This is not an economics primer, but it has a few good stories about the hidden side of some things."
2,Over Hyped,"Obviously the book has generated enormous buzz, but as other commentators have noted:a) it's a pumped up articleb) it self-admittedly has no central themec) correlation does not equal causationTo point (c), there's a certain amount of ""epater les conservatives"" by correlating the decline in crime in the 1990s to the rise in abortions in the 1970s.The disappointment of this book is that the method behind it is very intriguing, and I hope that the authors will produce a substantive book in the future applying his economic model to the serious questions behind crime, urban investment, and other issues that this current piece touches on.Not worth buying, particularly when you can read it at the library in about two hours."
5,Freakonomics,This book is an eyeopener...wakes your senses up to the other side of the discussion and reason for certain behaviours.Should be a must read for all college students and business folks.
2,"Shallow, uninspiring - better books around","This book is a very-easy-to-read disjointed sequence of some anecdotical commentary based on statistical analysis to prove ""interesting"" causes for everyday facts. Although the original idea is compelling, the book drivels on unispiring and uninsightful peripheral discussion.The theme of using the power of statistical analysis to find the probable causes of societal events, like the decrease or increase in murder rate, has been much better explored by authors like John Allen Paulos.To make matters worse, the author attempts to use very basic language to appeal to the mass audience. Although this meakes it easy read, it also trivialises the topic - there is a very strong sense of political correctness throughout as well.Overall, this book is a waste of money."
3,Interesting but not up to the hype,"The book covers some very interesting and controversial topics. Although the authors warn us that they consciously chose not to provide any unifying theme, the lack of one is still a serious drawback. I think the material would have been better presented as a series of strong magazine articles. The last part of the book really shows how hard the authors had to struggle to stretch this into book form - there are just lists and lists of names."
5,A proof that we need to learn how to ask questions,"Regardless of the topics covered, the book proves that we generally ask the wrong questions and come up with conventional wisdom answers. This book teaches us to look beyond the surface, amazing conclusions can be reached by doing serious econometrics analysis in simple matters, which have a high impact in our daily lives. Hope they write a second book on more topics. Or concentrate in a single one, like education. I found some of the conclusions in this field very shocking and interesting."
4,Making economics exciting,Freakonomics definitely put economics on the map and provided many who hadn't found the subject with a new positive look at economics. I would classify it as a pop economics kind of book with a nuanced look at the world around us. I wish Leavitt had talked about more economic theory instead of doing a case by case kind of examination. Needless to say the book was a great gift and provided me with a new view and made me more suspicious of conventional wisdom.
4,Creative Thinkings,"You definitely need to appricate statistics if you read this book. The reason I appreciated it so much is that it helped me to think more creatively. If you ever want to understand the negative impact that ""conventional wisdom"" can have on a society -- purchase this book!"
5,A new way to look at the world,Freakanomics is a great book to help you understand how the world really works. It allows you to see things from a different perspective.
3,Fun,"Whether you read Freakonomics or not, Superfreakonomics provides lots of entertaining facts as the economist Steven D. Levitt and journalist Stephen J. Dubner return with another quirky set of examples from the exciting world of behavioral economics. The prostitutes are back, along with terrorists, car seats, medical hand washing and a host of other explorations. The pace is jaunty, the facts delectable, and the result a story or two to pass along in conversation. Prepare to laugh and groan. Just don't let a friend walk home drunk. Read Superfreakonomics and find out why.Rating: Three-star (Recommended)"
4,eye-opening!,"it's been a while since I read this, but I found a lotta stuff that I hadn't really considered before -- rather unorthodox -- or at least outside what I know about economics -- very easy to read --"
3,Interesting,"The book is really interesting, and as the autor says, it has no ""unifying theme"". Its a bunch of papers, rewrited in a easy way, that the autor has released during his career. I haven't finish it yet, perhaps it has any surprise in the end."
4,An easy and interesting read!,"I thought it was a very interesting book, and I particularly enjoyed how the authors would combine seemingly irrelevant topics into seamless chapters. I am not by any means very into economics, but as I read each chapter I found myself laughing and enjoying what the authors have to say, and even sharing it with others. A great read!-Sydney H"
4,quick read,"Well written with the exception of several ""F"" bombs. This book gets you to look at things from the angle you don't even realize is there. I can't wait to read ""Super Freakonomics""."
3,If you're dazzled by this...,"...then you'd probably be equally dazzled to learn how a microwave works. There are a couple interested bits in it, but I don't think it warrants a book. It has obviously been expanded and then substantially dumbed down from The New Yorker articles. This is pretty obvious since the excerpts from the articles that lead into each chapter are interesting and well-written and yet the chapter that follows is rather pedestrian. All in all, I'd say that the character that is Stephen Levitt appears to be more interesting than the findings that are detailed in the book. Unfortunately, I think this book was crafted with the aim of selling a bunch of books at the Wall-Mart checkout line rather than a serious study of Levitt and his work -- which, from the excerpts, appear deserving."
2,"Overrated, disappointing.","The content of this book is similar to that of a Malcolm Gladwell book, though Gladwell writes in much more intelligent and thoughtful style. Freakonomics suffers from an excessively dumbed down ""Gee Whizz"" style as well as what appears to be a strong streak of ego or vanity on the part of Levitt (or possibly this is due to bad marketing advice from the book editors) in both the tone of the personal asides in the book and the odd self-promoting quotations from the same single NYTimes puff piece about Levitt literally at the front of every chapter.There are some interesting economics insights in the book, but I would really recommend ""The Undercover Economist"" by Tim Harford instead if you want to read a book about the economics of everyday life."
2,Unique but...,"I know this won't seem overly helpful, but this book was lacking something. Ok book, wouldn't read again."
4,"A fun book, written for a mss audience","A very fun book. Levitt uses his mathematical and economic background to try and find correlation between events and facts in an effort to explain some interesting phenomena. In many cases, he completely flies in the face of conventional wisdom. He covers a variety of topics without regard to a consistent theme, and has chapters on crime, drugs, abortion, sumo wrestling, real estate agents, baby names, and parenting habits. Ultimately his conclusions are thought provoking and hard to argue with as he backs everything up and does a good amount of analysis to prove them out. Amongst his claims to fame is the fact that his research led to the Chicago school system firing teachers who cheated on standardized tests - a study which he goes through in his book at a high level, avoiding most of the math that is somewhat inaccessible to the masses anyway."
2,This is not economics!,"This much hailed book is as close to Economics as Twitter tweets are to a novel. It's not that it skims the surface, the surface that it skims is not Economics but Sociology, Human Geography, Politics, Statistics, anything other than economic theory. Sure it's quite entertaining, and it might help you look at things in a different way, which is always a good thing, but anyone wanting to learn any Economics is going to be reading the wrong book."
4,Interesting - entertaining - stimulating even - but . . .,"This book is a fun read - no doubt. It stimulates your mind to think and ask questions about how our society is structured, and why people make the decisions that they do. This alone makes the book worth a read, for being stimulated to think by an entertaining read is about the most fun you can have without getting bacon grease everywhere.However, and I do not have the credentials to back this up, it does at times somewhat strain belief. Take that for what you will.Enjoy!"
1,Very low information content,"There is for sure intersting stuff in here. The authors describe in lay words very detailed academic studies and highlight their most controversial conclusions. Without doubt, the studies have been cherry picked by how controversial their conclusions are. But there's sooo much text around it. Does the reader need 20-ish rankings of first names? Does the reader need to read an amazingly boring history of the KKK, or of some gang in Chicago? Or 100 or so real estate stories? I don't."
4,Want to rethink what motivates us?,"Yes the book is not for the faint of heart. The book explains why so many unrelated events are actually related and why its important to you to realize this. No this book won't say your marriage, job, 401K, kids or anything else. But it will make you rethink your assumptions as to why cheaters cheat and why an architect is more likely to hire a prostitute than a prostitute is likely to hire an architect. Moreover it also humorously explains why the prostitute makes more per hour the the architect."
5,Wow.,"I couldn't sleep one night and picked up this from my goodies that I have no time to read. I opened it around 12AM and put it down around 3AM and all I can say: Stoned Statistics.I completed the whole book and want to read it again. It is a ""very cool"" insight like Wisdom of Crowds that I'd highly recommend also."
4,"Controversial, challenging, and a blast to read","If you are looking for a book that will challenge the way you look at American culture, this is it. Levitt tackles everyday issues with no regard for political correctness or the status quo.Even if you don't agree with every conclusion, he presents the evidence in a way that is hard to refute and impossible to ignore.I never thought I would encounter a book written by an economist that would be nearly impossible to put down, and would weave its way into my daily conversation around the water cooler, but here it is."
3,More than a little overrated,"This book was highly recommended by a very well-read friend. I was surprised to find it to be primarily a collection of ""gee whiz"" essays that would seem better placed in a mid-level book on the use of statistical analysis than as a best seller. If this is regarded as thinking outside that box people are always talking about, then I would guess that every graduate student in the country taking a decent class on statistics in social science research is getting a whale of an introduction to creative problem solving. It's a book that might be well used by teachers of basic statistic classes looking for stories to pique the interest of their students. For a reader seriously interested in a creative look at pressing social problems, keep looking. This book might be of interest if you can buy a used copy at a good price."
1,Sort of a disappointment,"Somewhere between the repeated quotations saying how brilliant the authors are and the statement that the crack dealers are much the same as MacDonalds, I lost interest."
3,Amusing...,"Not scientific, a bit naive sometimes and oversimplified, and very simplistic, it is nonethless an agreeable reading, for a nice afternoon/evening with nothing better to do."
2,Over-Hyped,"This one certainly wins this year's price for over-hyped books. Based on 5 pages of usefull material by an economist a professional writer makes a 207 page book by stretching it extermely thin with not so relevant sidelines and notes.This does not make it a worthless book, telling the general public that econometric analysis can yield some interesting insights in the working of our society is a usefull feat, certainly when it makes a useless politician stumble into political incorrectness by repeating one of the facts in the book. Political correctness is dead in the streets and intellectual circles but luckily not yet on Capitol Hill.All this does not make it a rogue book however, just plain micro-economics of every day live, and there are far better introductions into that than this book."
2,Disjointed,"The author rambled through stories ranging from the Ku Klux Klan to Ted Kisenski without explaining what they had to do with economics. He rambled on about drug dealers, painting houses, Superman conquering the KKK, and why parents' efforts raising their kids is worthless.He must be smart, but he can't write a book."
2,Doesn't deliver,"This book doesn't live up to the hype. Anyone with a passing interest in economics will find it mildly interesting at best. With the exception of the causal analysis of crime, the book is a bore.It's too bad. The cover says to be prepared to be dazzled. I was and I wasn't."
5,great price,Purchased as a used book but looked brand new. Not a fan of the topic but had to read for school. Glad I didn't spend a lot of money on it.
4,We assume we know so much! I was inspired to look at the world a bit differently.,"I could relate to the concept of this book, that things are not as they truly seem at times. We assume so much in this world, but our views are often limiting, getting us by just so we can accomplish what needs to be done, but keeping us from the mechanisms at work. If we ask the right questions, maybe we can make things work a whole lot better. If you like to people watch, if you like logic, if you strive to get to the bottom of things to reveal the raw truth, you will probably enjoy this book. I was surprised over and over again as the writers found new ways to look at the data and dig in. I was inspired to look at the world around me a bit differently, for the sake of the truth, efficiency and maybe even greater happiness."
1,A Load of Garbage,"I assumed Freakonomics would be a book that used statistics to debunk various societal hysterias and fearmongering in a semi-humorous way. I quickly realized what I was in for when early in the book when the authors gave their background as Harvard Jews and profiled a guy that infiltrated the KKK for the ADL. The story sounds at least partially made up.It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using ""data"" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun. This book would probably appeal to upper middle class liberals who like to consider themselves clever and politically astute from their isolated armchairs. For me Freakonomics was a big load of garbage."
3,Not up to the Hype,"I was generally disappointed. I would describe the book as long explanations of alternative ways to interpret data. Inspite of the hype, about 1/4th of the book read like an economics text (yawn). The rest of the book was better, much was actually fascinating. I came away with the feeling that there was a really good, concise 80 page book hiding somewhere inside this 250 page book.Giblet's review hit the nail on the head. Levitt and his work sound VERY interesting. Unfortunately, it seems Dubner wanted to use this as an excuse to put forward an agenda. A 'reporter' would have done a better job of this than an 'opinion column editor.'It is probably worth a read but not before you have read Tipping Point, Ishmael, Going Local, Theory of Power, and......... (you get the idea)."
1,Completey Irrelevant,"Listening to the CD was only slightly more interesting than staring at a car in front of me in traffic. The premise sounds great, but I have learned nothing useful having completed the 6-CD set."
2,Not cost-effective,"Interesting stories -- but only a few of them. Lots of space taken by lists of children's names. Do like good economists, save your money, and get the anecdotes from the book reviews and the authors' TV appearances. I bought the book -- dumb me."
2,Hardly worth the price.,"The author should research how a book like this gets hyped by the book industry without any good reason. One or two pages, maybe of interesting insights but overall a money grab by the author and his very own Ed McMahon."
2,Disappointing,"The authors use shock and awe to make comparisons of unlikely circumstances. Initially I found the technique entertaining. By the end of the article, oops I mean book, the technique wears thin. So thin in fact that in examining the name game the whole thing just sort of peters out. They don't have a clue as to what's behind a parents name choice for their child (that is, an ethnic parent). They try to draw some correlation between the name and future expectations, but of course cannot because they don't know enough about the subject. They are caught up in their own little world looking to unrelated data to find an answer rather than going out and doing the hard investigative grunt work needed to explore the subject. As suggested by other reviewers, read the times article or check out your local library. Better yet, if you must, go to a good bookstore, grab a comfy chair and a cup of coffee..."
3,A bit tedious,"The author has made several important points, but they could have been made more economically and summarily. This book could have benefited from some strong editing."
5,Perfect Book Club book,This is a fascinating book. The author asks and answers questions which are a different take on the problem to be researched. It is very readable but gives opportunity for intense discussions.
4,Very Interesting Concepts,"I was impressed with the various suggestions and explanations. The chapter about drug dealers was an eye opener, as was the chapter about parental influence. I did enjoy the added sections in the new revision. I gave it a 4 because I think it could have been longer. It seems the original book must have been short indeed."
2,I guess I don't get it...,"I don't know if I will make it through the last 50 pages of this book, it's bored me so. I was really excited to get it based on the feedback/ratings on Amazon, but it focuses so much on crime and abortion. It's far from a Rogue Economist Exploring the Hidden Side of ""Everything"".I probably shouldn't rate a book that I've only read 3/4 of, but I can't see the last 1/4 being so good that it changes my mind."
4,"another Zentango ""Top Shelf"" classic","along w/ Gladwell's works, this is another creative, insightful ""must read"" for today's entrepreneur - too many times we tend to ""react"" to news & media; instead, if we step back & understand underlying forces at work, we often need different, more effective ""responses"""
4,Demand curve slightly higher than supply,"Interesting analyses of some very serious topics, written in a quite readable fashion. Would have appreciated more prospective analyses and policy suggestions, however."
5,Perspectives...,Life is all about perspectives especially this book. The authors add metrics to life situations and may change your perspective in the process.
3,A good book struggling to get out,"Unbelievably cheesy title. Seriously misleading subtitle. An introduction that gives away most of the book's conclusions. Breathless feature-page prose. All of these flaws are based on the assumption that the book was not intrinsically interesting and had to be tarted up. Which is a shame, because Leavitt's insights are actually interesting. I give Leavitt's contributions five stars, but William Morrow's and Stephen Dubner's contributions one star, which leads to the compromise rating shown above.A lot of reviewers, you'll notice, rate the book based strictly on Leavitt's provocative analysis of statistics relating to crime and abortion. Whether the book is worth reading, apparently, depends on whether it supports your preconceived views -- proof that you can give people data but you can't make them think."
1,"snore me, bore me, schmooze me but don't read this book","this has to be one of the most over-rated books of all time.It's full of anecdotes but has few facts or statistics.Asserting that something is true does not make it so. I believe that such assertions should be proven. This book does not do this.Also the author has an obsession with racial issues though the title and objective of his book would not suggest that.The author goes on and on about the KKK, David Duke, black gangs on the south side of Chicago and various other civil rights topics.What does this have to do with economics or statistics?Most annoying are the hagiographic content that leads every chapter just make sure we know what a ""genius"" this economist is.Unfortunately I bought the audio version of the book and thus I don't have the hardcopy that would have served as good kindling as the Indiana winter sets in."
1,WOW!/Embarrassing,"For a certain audience: You are so smart now!For other people: The only freakonomics going on here is the freakish amount of cash people are dishing out to buy this con of a book. Reading this book reminded me of how bad students pad their papers with unnecessary quotes, big fonts, 2.5 spacing between lines, big margins, etc... Buy any other book on economics or anything else, for that matter. Surf the internet for a few hours and learn so much more. You want to be enlightened, but enlightenment doesn't come from reading a few sketchy chapters of fake revelations. Kant is a breakthrough, Keynes is a breakthrough. Buy something real and spend the summer with it. Hard work pays off. Buy this, waste 3 hours, beg god to have those 3 hours back."
1,Que va!,"I bought this to help my Spanish classes learn to dance. Cheesy doesn't begin to describe the video. My students were too busy laughing at the video to learn anything. Que lastima. I would still like to find a good salsa video, but this isn't it."
4,from a parental point of view . . .,"(Disclaimer: the following is merely an opinion by this viewer) I certainly enjoyed this film for most of the reasons already cited. But please note: it does contain many violent sequences (it is after all, an 'action movie'!), including a brutal knife fight, ongoing gun carnage, a bit of drug usage (opium), and some PG language. The 'R' rating might be a tad overkill (pun intended), but parents of youngsters might want to be advised of these issues nonetheless (preview first?). An additional note for 'animal lovers': I don't know how the producers ultimately pulled it off without injury ('animatronics' in credits), but one sequence appeared to be quite rough on the equine element. I can only hope it was camera/effects trickery!"
5,Awesome and Original!,A definite must see. A movie unlike any other. It is daring imaginative and action packed. I enjoyed myself immensely watching this original screenplay. No regrets to be had at all.
4,"crazy,funny,entertaining",im a fan of all movies. i must say i was entertained and laughed quite a bit. really good watch. will buy more from these actors/director.
3,Frenetic Action,"Lots of non stop action in this frenetic movie. It's like the characters were all hyperactive kids who then grew up and amped up the hyperactivity with caffeine and steroids and then became overly violent. The sets were kind of surreal, the violence was over the top, the characters did not seem like real people and the storyline was rather thin. I found it kind of dragged on too long and the ending was disappointing but the movie was definitely something very different and for that reason I watched the whole thing. I watched it initially because it had the actor Song Kang-ho in it but I must say I liked him much better in the movies Sympathy For Mr Vengeance, The Host,Joint Security Area and Secret Sunshine."
5,Just another generic review I'd Say,"This film is great, a rare find, well, not litterally, just a gem that may have been underestimated at first."
2,"The Good, the Bad, the Weird",Good movie but bad disc. That's only release of this movie in world with 1080i (not p) transfer. Also extras much less than on uk blu-ray.
2,Just not that great,I guess I was expecting a lot. It did not deliver. A bit silly and the action was not as great as everyone has made it out to be. Silly and boring.
4,"The Good, The Bad, and the Indiana Jones","Was easily a 7.0 to 8.0. A nice blend of a western and action (a la Indy).I would say it was Hollywood-quality, but unfortunately that no longer means anything with everything coming out of it being driven by CG, 3D, over the top blood splatter across the shaky camera, mediocre films.The GB&W; is action from the get go and it rarely let's you stop to take a breath. Very little use of CG (or at the least it's non-intrusive except for the credits at the beginning). The actors do most their own stunts according to the bonus footage."
3,Comedy Western in Korean style + Some hilarious scenes + Exciting and non-stop action scenes,"It's a comedy Western movie in Korean style. Some scenes are hilarious scenes. The action scenes are exciting and non-stop with very little use of CGI. There is no depth in the plot and the characters. It's also completely nonsense but I don't mind. It's just a comedy! The acting is good enough to keep me watching for 2 hours. The twist ending is entertaining.In short, it's worth watching once."
3,Book lacks depth and clarity,"I had high hopes from this book after reading several other reviews. However its been a real disappointment in terms of not enough explanations of subject matter alongwith few workable examples. The book does start of well with a ""Hello World"" example but then looses focus providing the reader with several confusing details and code snippets."
3,Good book but too much detailed information.,"I bought this book without carefully looking at the cover that this book is a definiteive reference. So the content is a bit too verbose for my expectation. I am looking for something that's a bit tutorial with rationales given here and there. Not a reference, whose information I can find from the website."
5,An excellent all-rounder,"There is something for everyone, novice to expert. The best practices alone are worth the price of the book."
2,Hibernate not much in action,"I read this book after a rought time dealing with theprofesional hibernate book. I gave 'Profesional Hibernate'a lousy review - mostly based on the amount of typos and innaccurate technical references when decribing the java language.This book wasa little better - though again, not quite meaty enough for my liking. And not at all 'in action' - at least not real world action.This book would do you well as an introduction to hibernate and, byu the looks of it, is about as good as it gets with Hibernate books.Be careful how much faith you put in these reviews - I know that the authors of these partcular books are posting against each other in a very unprofessional way."
2,Great disappointment,"May be this book is good in explaining the concept. But when we want to learn a new technology, first thing the learner is looking for is to run a ""HELLO WORLD"" type of program.In order to run my first program I had to go thru hell to run it. My advice it if you want to learn HIBERNATE for the first time this is not the book."
3,Novices need not apply,"While I must give credit to the authors for a well-laid out and thorough book, I think that it is important to mention (as some other reviewers have also noted) that the material covered is more suitable for more seasoned programmers. As a case in point, the very first ""Hello World"" example is abstract and cannot be run as is. In this regard the actual product documentation is more helpful. Unfortunately, I can't suggest an alternative, but if you are looking for an introductory-level book, this might not be what you were hoping for."
2,"Great concepts, Worthless index, Questionable technology","The authors do a fine job explaining the concepts behind object relational mapping in general and Hibernate in particular. Too bad the book is absolutely crippled by its index. For instance, there is no entry for ""discriminator"" (or anything close to that), so to go back to that section where I positively recall reading about this term, I have to browse the whole book. Ridiculous. Furthermore, the following statement by the authors themselves throws this entire technology into question: ""Retrieving persistent objects from the database is one of the most interesting (and complex) parts of working with Hibernate."" If this is so complex, than the Java community has been sold a bill of goods, and its no wonder the exodus to Ruby is gaining momentum."
5,A great book to start up hibernate,"I like it because it is only around 400 pages. It does not blindly copy-and-paste information you can find on the web sites. The introduction chapter summarize the paradigm mismatch of ORM and how hibernate is trying to solve, which is also an interesting start."
4,Budgeting concepts,"The best part of this book is the recognition that most of us have moved into management without any formal training, and then explained the concepts as if we do not know anything (we do not) without making us feel like fools. For the first time I now actually understand what a regression analysis means....The not so nice part is the book is the small print. I would have been willing to pay more for a bigger book with more pages so that the font would be more readable... My suggestion, get it in e-format, and you will get a lot of happier readers :)"
2,OK but not great,The book a different drummer takes place in a lot of different peoples perspectives. Every chapter someone else talks about there life. it is very confusing. I would not reccomend this book.
1,Sterling Silver Lapis Ring,"The ring was absolutely gorgeous when it arrived. However, the Lapis stone fell out about four months after I received it, and I did not even wear it ever day. Very disappointed in the quality!!"
2,disappointed,"I would return this, if it wasn't given to me as a gift. The leather looks cheap, the underside is too slippery, and it's too short overall even at the longest setting. The padding is nice, but that's about."
3,Tough Leather,"This leather strap has a great smell to it. It is real leather. It is not flexible, though. It takes time to ""break it in""."
5,Summer activities,I'm always looking for activities to keep my 7 year old grandson engaged. This keeps him occu[ied and and he loves it.
5,retractable scissors,I have been looking for this for a while now. Makes it so much easier to have my scissors handy to cut those loose strings when sewing.
5,2900 Power Jet Was Answer to Problem,"I have a small pond of 1,000 gallons with a waterfall feature... Water needed to be ""pushed"" about six feet vertical for the ""falls"". I wanted the ""fountain"" to provide a pleasant feature on the pond surface. This pump does both very well. I was able to discontinue using two pumps for the pond... Very pleased with the pump and with the supplier, also..."
4,Superb piece of german trance.,This is another good release by DJ Sakin. Nice tune & good melody. All the mixes are good. Must have for Sakin fans and techno/trance fanatics.
1,Terrible Packaging,The rolls arrived completely crushed. Terrible packaging. I needed these for a dinner party but found out replacement was not an option. Very disappointed.....
4,Spring Roll Wrappers,"Yummy. Incredibly wonderful customer service that totally resolved a slight problem with my shipment. I shall try many more of their products and recommend them to friends, and to you!"
4,great for appetizers,These rice papers are smaller than the ones I have had before but that just means thry can hold lessd and can be better used as appetizers thanas larger ones I used for measl. Paper very forgiving and strong and they work well. It just took me a litle time not to fill them as much as I did the larger ones. Bt people ate every one- all 60 with great reviews. It just took longer to make thats allk.
3,Trumpton Riots,"I first heard this album when it first came out in 1994,then lost track of it.I have just picked up a copy again and it is as good and funny as i first remembered it.Trumpton riots is based on a UK animated childrens programm from the 1970's but with lyrics re-worked in the classic HMHB mode.this is a funny and quirky cd that deserves a listen."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful!!!!","Do not waste your money on this DVD. The illustrations are trite and dated (mid to late 1960's). This is merely a DVD ""filmstrip""--a real blast from the past. I was going to use it to teach parliamentary procedure to high school students. I would be laughed out of the room if I used this. And now I understand that since I unwrapped this terrible product to preview this before I used it in the classroom, I cannot return it for a full refund.Amazon folks, what a rip-off!!! Ninety-nine dollars for this piece of crap! I am not a happy customer."
3,Good taste but messy in a larger popper,"This glaze works well, but I would strongly recommend that you do it with smaller batches and use smaller poppers, not large 8 oz commercial poppers. The bigger the machine you use it, the more effort you will then have to expend to remove it from the appliance. It sticks well to everything. The grape is a refreshing taste and a good change from the caramel."
3,Archos Stand for 604 Wi Fi,"The stand is nice looking and well made, however the Archos does not fit to well, it has to be forced into it especially by the plug opening. Perhaps it should have been made somewhat loose."
2,archos stand case,"The case is ok. The stand which is a part of the case wasn't what I thought it would be. It wasn't as firm as I thought it would be, but it did the job of holding the device. Before getting this case I had spent $3 for a small easel upon which I place the Archos 604. It served me a lot better. I was able to view the moniter at a slant and raised a few inches off the table top. Plus if I had to use the plug to power the unit the space under the easel better accomodated it. With the case you can only view the moniter if using the battery power. Overall the case works in a pinch."
5,twilght comes twice,"This book puts a lot of descriptive writing in it. It doesn't really have a problem. I love the way the author says ""slowly dusk pours the syrup of darkness into the forest"". In the pictures, they always put the girl's dog with the girl. I think you would like thiss book if you are 9 and up to 12. I loved this book. Giuliana G."
4,Fastest Ball,Funny tale that is an extrapalation of an article that appeared in Sports Illistrated on April 1 about a pitcher for the New York Mets that supposedly could throw a baseball well over 100 miles per hour.This is his story and what could have happened.
4,An Enjoyable Baseball Novel,"Plimpton has teased out an April Fool's Sports Illustrated article on a monk turned superhuman baseball pitcher into a fun full-length novel. You don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate the curious mix of the New York Mets eager management and the shy unlikely pitching phenom, Sidd Finch.The story revolves around a deadbeat ex-writer with writer's block who befriends Finch and his carefree college-dropout girlfriend. The book is filled with uniquely Plimptonian anecdotes and characters as it follows Finch through spring training and his Shea Stadium debut with the New York Mets.Although very fun and a page-turner, you can feel that it is Plimpton's first novel. It suffers from pacing problems and I was a bit disappointed by the quick, sharp ending."
5,Last Days of Pompeii,Needed this product to give as present. Terrific book!! and received invery condition.
3,Rather brief,I had purchased this hoping it to be more about Archimedes. Instead it follows the discovery of a manuscript with Archimedes writings on it. I have read the book that inspired this documentary and it covers the subject briefly but well.
4,Very interesting documentary but...,"This documentary, it should be said, is primarily about the history of the Archimedes Palimpsest (a previously unknown work by Archimedes rediscovered in the 20th century and, even there, lost from WWI until recently). This is a very interesting story but there is less about Archimedes life and discoveries than I would personally have hoped.Moreover, for some reason, there seems to always be a desire to present this kind of thing with a maximum of spooky music, spooky noises, shady characters and so on. Is it necessary to dumb-down everything and try to make it ""interesting"" by implying there is some ""conspiracy"" or ""secret"" story? Unfortunately, you would think so watching the discovery channel and the history channel. Even PBS is not immune.Nonetheless, I found this documentary to be very interesting."
2,Not for beginners,I am currently taking Diff EQ and this book is not helpful at all. It shows very few examples and skips too many steps. I am very frustrated with this book and would not recommend it to people taking this course for the first time
2,not so great,"The stapler worked OK, but only worked correctly for a whole cartridge of staples, one out of six times. Right now I don't have any cartridges that will work with it, although I do have three partial cartridges! Not sure whether the problem is the stapler or the staples, but this is unsatisfactory."
1,this thing is junk,"I have tried this with Swingline 3/8, 1/2, and 3/4 inch staples and it almost never works. Sometimes the 1/2 inch staples will work, but most of the time they fold over, and the 3/8 and 3/4 inch staples always fold over. Yes, I following the guide on the stapler for what size of staple to use based on the number of sheets."
1,Don't try to use other brands of staples in it.,"The stapler that our office purchased only works properly with swingline brand staples. The staple brand we use would not advance through the stapler. You had to manually stick something into the chamber and force the staples down to the end after every use. We discovered why this was when we placed the two sets of staples end to end. The swingline brand staples were actually a tiny bit wider than the other brand even though they were the ""same size."" Also, Even when the stapler is full, it takes two presses to get the staple to go through the paper even if it just a small stack."
1,Hard to change staple sizes,"I have used the Swingline 3/8"" and 1/2"" heavy duty staples. Unfortunately, when trying to remove the 1/2"" staples so I could switch sizes, I can't get them out!UPDATE 1/7/12: I had forgotten that I already wrote a review about this and logged on to review because I am so frustrated. I spent my hard-earned money on the stapler and staples and I can never get it to work. I can't get the staples out and when I do staple, only one side goes through the paper. I HATE THIS STAPLER!"
5,Definately one to read again and again,"This book was my favorite to read to my younger brothers and now its my neice's favorite book. It is definately a book that I recommend to those who have older siblings. I will always remember Homer and his struggles and the immortal.. ""Beans"", said Homer..."
5,Laugh till you cry!,"This has been my favorite book for as long as I can remember. Every time I read it I laugh till I cry! Now my daughter can read it and we can laugh together. It was out of print for a while, and I am so glad it is available for purchase again!! Great for 4-7 year olds. Clever humor that very little ones won't 'get'."
4,Snap Circuits,"I bought this for my seven year old who has enjoyed making things with it and also tried to build new ""inventions"" with it. However although it demonstrates the uses of various electronic components it does not teach you what the individual components are actually doing. As such I think it needs an adult with some knowledge to try and explain each of the parts. The child would not be able to work it out themselves.Kit is well constructed, has many many things to build and I think will continue to get more life as he gets older."
5,Brandon's gift,This gift was a Christmas present for our grandson. Brandon is eight but loves these types of gifts. He loves to build. He very much enjoys this gift and states he is learning alot from it.
5,Electronics introduction for kids,"I have 2 boys ages 7 and 5. Working in IT, I wanted to introduce them to some aspect of electronics and thought this would be perfect. The kit is high in quality, easy to set up and follow and best of all - allows for parents to spend quality time with kids. It does not teach about what each of the components really does but at this age probably a stretch any way. I highly recommend."
1,Review,"Snap Circuits seems to be greatly enjoyed by the recipient. After inspecting Snap Circuits was concerned that this was beyond the comprehension of a six year old. However, he is able to follow the instruction diagrams with little difficulty and terms Snap Circuits as a ""great present"".Snap Circuits Extreme SC-750"
3,Promising but Expensive,"Initial impressions after working with my 10 and 13-year old boys for a week: promising, but may need more punch to sustain interest and drive many of the learnings it seeks to achieve, especially for about $100.Overall, the product has good durability, is well designed, and allows kids to get moving pretty quickly. Unlike other sets in this domain, Snap does an excellent job in the component design, allowing kids to readily snap together circuits to build various projects right away and in minutes. That provides the kids with initial positive reinforcement to see the job done and working. The issue then becomes the wow factor of the projects themselves. Think it is somewhat mixed, but looking to learn more after additional projects.Unfortunately in the days of Xboxes and iPods, excitement level thresholds are higher, and the excitement factor connected to the results of the projects here may offer some challenges."
5,Minecraft Redstone Circuits for Real,"This was a Christmas gift for our 10-year-old son who enjoys playing Minecraft online. According to him, this is really cool because it is like making redstone circuits (available in the game) for real. He really likes the variety of projects available in this set and always wants to share his results with the rest of the family (they are impressive).If the user of this is good with spatial relations (good with legos), then they will be good with this!"
5,Awesome,"I love this product, and so does my daughter.We have done so many projects included in this kit. Strongly recommend this product to expose your kids to the awesome world of electronics."
1,Not the best intro to science for kids,"Seems cool when you look at it. You think ""my kid is gonna be a master electrician after he/she plays with this!"" But, my kid looked at it and just ended up playing Star Wars with it and I could've bought some Star Wars toys if he wanted those and they wouldn't have cost me $100 smackeroos! Not durable either, as I type my son is snapping off little plastic things on it. Just save your money and send them to college or take them to a museum or discovery center with it instead of buying all these products which don't do anything but sit around and collect dust."
1,Finally! Had a hard time trying to give feedback to seller...,I bought the Snap Circuits Extreme SC-750 and I was very disappointed when this product arrived. It looks like it was re packaged since the lower box doesn't fit the top box. To top it all it was re sealed but whoever re sealed the box left a strand of hair stuck inside the box. Gross! I tried to leave the seller a message or feedback but every time I click sellers feedback it defaults to a different product that I have purchased.When I go to amazon.com/feedback this product doesn't show up. I really hope that the product will work since I have no time to return/replace it.
5,7 year old loves it...,"My 7 year old son was just given this as a gift.Product is well built, instructions for each experiment are clear, and easy to understand.Very rewarding when the pieces are put together, and the project actually works - everytime.innovative, educational, interactive puzzle....Great toy. no problems with it whatsoever.Keep a BUNCH of ""AA"" batteries on hand though - as he's burning through a couple of them every few 5 - 7 days."
5,Snap circuits are great!,"My son got this for his birthday and loves it. He opened the box and had his first circuit built in a few minutes. It was like eating potato chips, he couldn't get enough and always wanted to do one more. I would highly recommend it."
4,My son loves it!,"We gave our son the SC-750 for his birthday, and he loves it. I started out working with him to help get him started, but he was soon doing projects on his own. He doesn't always read all of the educational text with the diagrams, but he's still learning from it. Great price at Amazon, too."
5,Would buy it again,"I bought this for my fourteen year old nephew. He gets bored easily, but the ability to make so many different experiments kept him quietly occupied for hours."
5,Amazeballs,My seven year old got this for his birthday and both he and his 2 year old sister are OBSESSED with it. GET IT.
2,First project was a disaster,"Grandson has had the 250 project set since summer and has enjoyed it immensely. Opened up the present Christmas morn and put the first project together. The FM radio would not work. Trouble shot the circuit and all components and circuits were in place batteries were fresh and there was power all the way through. In a dense urban CA area I would have expected to receive more than static. Volume and tuner worked but apparently the included antenna is DOA. Big turnoff for a young, aspiring electronics guy! Now comes the issue of getting a replacement."
4,Very good educational toy,This is a very good introduction to the Science for the kids. My kids (8 & 10) loved it. They asked me lot of questions about how it works.
5,AWESOME,My boys are 8 and 11 and have little experinece with building stuff or electronics. I figured that they would like this so their Grandma got them the Extreme SET! What a thrill!! Soon as they opened it up it was hit. They play with it all of time and always showing off their projects. I was helping them at first it is fun for adults too. But they have been on their own and are doing fine with their projects. They have 4 projects books and are using all 4! They are getting the Deluxe Rovers for Christmas I am so excited! This is so much better than all those video games they play with. The only thing that i would suggest is that you might want to get a set that comes with a case. There are a lot of small parts.
4,Teach them young...,"What a fun product. I have been toying with getting this for almost a year. My eight year old step-son is a math an computer wizard and and is always looking for ways to challenge himself. The easy setup of this system is to be commended.As an engineer who works with this stuff everyday I have a few issues. There really is no documentation on how it is made. Do these pieces have built in protection so that the magic smoke stays in? If there are short circuits (not that it ever happens :)...) what happens?Overall, I see hours of fun and adventure for a very active mind. I also look forward to doing something with him which we can share."
5,fabulous,My 13-year-old video game addict says this is the best gift ever! He splits his time between this and video games. FABULOUS!
3,Snap Circuits SC-750,"I had ordered this one just before Christmas, but unfortunately went missing, probably due to Christmas overload. So contacted Amazon, they resent the item which appeared 4 days later. My son (age 9) loves this. The circuits start from very basic, so it is a lot easier to make and understand.What I would have liked is to have some explainations (in plain english, not the whole electrical/electronic theory, if possible) on various items in the box and about the circuits.Definitely recommended if your child is science oriented."
3,Don't be misled by the number of circuits,"the vast majority of circuits are variations on previous ones. This makes most un-interesting to build. A more honest product would boast that over 30 different basic circuits can be built and each one has many variations.The PC related stuff is strictly for much older kids, even though younger kids can do most of the basic circuits like alarms, detectors, etc. Don't waste your money on this extreme kit unless the child is going to get into the PC software as well, with or without your help.While you can buy this or the simpler kits for a younger child, and they can follow the instructions and duplicate the experiments, there is definitely an age below which the circuits will just be copied, without much understanding of what is going on. In other words the accessibility and ease of use of the kit is attractive, but misleading. I think it could be made smaller, more complex and ultimately more interesting without losing anything (for older children)."
5,Super Christmas Gift,"This product came on time and all pieces were there.It works great so,far.My son enjoyed doing thirty progects on CHRISTMAS DAY and has many more to do."
5,Fascinating and Easy to Understand,"Although I knew some about the radiocommunications spectrum, I never really understood it. This book explained the basics of spectrum technology in clear language and then added a discussion on the policy which makes it easy to understand. For instance, I now understand the underlying technical and policy rationals for many new technologies, including wi-fi."
1,"Sorry if you're reading this, Marlon","Please save your money and do not purchase this DVD. I bought this as my first salsa DVD and was very disappointed, not to mention betrayed. Marlon takes at least twice as long to say something as anyone else would. He often says, ""We're not uh, uh, uh, going to cover this because, uh, uh, we did in our, uh, previous episode."" The other problem is that it is a very odd form of Salsa. He doesn't use the the standard 1-2-3, 5-6-7. He also will do something rediculous like bending over and turning in circles. He will spend at least 10 minutes on this, and then go in the other direction for another 10 minutes.For a real salsa dvd, check out Juan & Diana, or Al & Edie."
2,"Loaded with carbs, ""juice"" is not lemon but grape","""No sweeteners"" on the can, yet the first ingredient listed after carbonated water is ""White grape juice concentrate"", which might not be sucrose, but since when is that not sugar? Each small (8.4 oz) can has 170 calories and 41 carbs. I was so excited to find a healthy fun drink, but this is not itThe flavor? A lot like Mountain Dew. Mostly sugar, yes there's some lemon in it, but it's hard to tell it's Meyer lemon as opposed to some other type. Another example of food manufacturers slipping a very unhealthy drink into the market as ""100% juice, no preservatives, no sweeteners, all natural"" -- Better they should say ""drink this to make SURE you get fat and type 2 diabetes!!!"""
5,Nice refreshing taste,I purchased these as a give-away for for a meeting. The taste is refreshingly different and everyone commented on the fresh taste.
2,Didn't smell the same,I've worn this perfume for many years. When I bought this product it didn't smell the same as previous bottles. I will not be buying this one again.
5,Very Inticing sexual aroma!,Love the way it smells. Its heavy at first probably the first 10 mins after you spray. But then if you smell it again the fruity smells pop right out . Pineapple was a very pleasant fruity smell along with all the other fruits combined equal a nice fruit concoction of almost silk smooth wonderfulness. My husband loves it cant wait to wear it. Its spring time so the warm air will send it through the air like the wind. In love.Meg
5,A longtime FAVORITE fragrance,"I have had a huge crush on this perfume for years. Amazon is the only place I can find it anymore. This is a wonderfully sweet, fun fragrance that lasts on your clothes for a long time. I get many compliments when wearing this. I love this and would recommend!"
5,Amazing,"I bought this perfume last year at a store not amazon but had to review it. Amazing fragrance! The scent is addicting, I get compliments everywhere I go. I recently just ran out and found amazon to have the best price so I am now waiting for my product to arrive in the mail."
3,Smells great until you put it on,"I like this perfume, but for some reason when I wear it the smell becomes too much and gives me a headache after a while. I prefer Escada's Sunset Heat."
5,Magnetic !!!,"I must say I am blessed with a great aroma chemical balance . This perfume is awesome, I have been wearing it for years and teh price is excellent. It's delicious ...Fast shipper, will do business again"
4,"Great preamp, with a caveat","This is a smooth sounding preamp, and the price is right. My one disappointment is that I had assumed you'd be able to connect two moving coil turntables at the same time and switch between them, but you can't. You could connect one MC and one MM turntable simultaneously, but I don't use MM cartridges. I place the blame on myself, for not doing a little research and reading the small print. Otherwise, you forget it's there, which is the whole point. I'm about to get a tube preamp, costing several times as much, for my other MC turntable. I'll then be able to compare it to this one and hear whether the extra money was worth it."
5,Phono Preamp,"The TCC TC-760LC Phono Preamp provided the needed boost for my moving coil cartridge.Having a level control allows you to maximize the sound level without introducing any distortion from overloading.The cartridge never sounded better. The preamp has a smooth, unfatigued sound quality.Highly recommended!"
3,Too much message not enough mystery,"Anita Servi, the plucky NYC social worker is back. She takes a job working for an organization that serves the elderly and immediately starts falling over dead folks. The author does a fine job portraying old people and draws a believable potrait of the city but the book's message is a heavy lead weight.There was way too much preaching about assisted suicide, and religion. Clea's character is a delight but it was extremely unrealistic, in a city like New York where everyone is obsessed with race that no-one has a problem with Anita and her husband Benno's adoption of her. This is going to be my last Anita Servi book. When I sit down to a mystery, I expect to be entertained, not lectured or bored. There is a lot of good in this author's writing but someone ought to tell her that in fiction it's more important to tell the story than to advance a social theory."
1,Not a mystery!,"A desperately boring tale that is not a mystery. The only mystery is - why was it published? Perhaps the story would resonate with that narrow group of social workers that service older, dying people. Most normal readers will feel cheated."
5,One Of A Kind / Tastefully Written,"I saw Choices Of The Heart as a wonderful heart felt book about love, loss, and the ability to overcome your pain and fears, which was something I could relate to. It inspired me and touched my heart. I cant wait to read Ms. Lassitter's next book, she add's just the right spark!"
2,"What first seemed colorful, now seems trite.","When I first encountered Jill McCorkle's writing, the depth and humor of her characters struck me. However, after reading all of her novels and this, her second book of short stories, I am struck by how the same ""quirky"" people keep popping up in different disguises. Surely someone with an imagination as vivid as McCorkle doesn't need to recycle her characters and can give us something more interesting than these caricatures? I am very disappointed, and hope that these past two works of McCorkle's don't represent a trend."
1,Sloppy and BORING,"I really wanted to love this book, but I didn't. The first story is the best by far, and it lured me into buying the book. But as I read on I was disappointed to find that every story sounded alike. I felt tormented and wanted to shred the book. The effect was sloppy and BORING."
1,Bad & Boring!,"What's happened to McCorkle? Her third novel showed some promise, even though it was rambling and predictable and awkwardly constructed. Nothing much ever happens in her books, either. You are reading along and get to page 200 and you go: ""When is something going to happen?""Her most recent books and stories are outrageous imitations of the more successful Southern writers. What's next? Her ""own"" version of the Ya-Yas? Wait and see."
2,3 stooges 3d,What a disappointment ! The 3 D it self is alright . The problem is the episodes that were chosen to convert to 3 D . There are way better Three Stooges episodes .
4,Better 3D than I expected,"I was surprised by the quality of the 2D to 3D conversion, very well done. If you are looking for additional 3D content for a decent price get this. Also, it's a good example of where the technology might be taking classic movies in the next couple of years. Hope they do lots more Three Stooges 3D conversions too. Four stars because the colorization isn't the greatest."
4,This was fun!,"Yes, the four shorts on this disc were filmed in black-and-white, 2D. Yes, they have been colorized. Yes, the 3D is a conversion process.But the colorization is about as good as I've ever seen, and the same goes for the 3D-conversion.These shorts were new to me. Seeing them in color and 3D made them more fun than I expected."
4,Very good 3D,"The episodes selected was quite funny, but I was very impressed how good the 3D looked in such old movies."
2,ok.,Just converted 2d to 3d. poor quality. 3d effects are weak at some places. worth if you get it for cheap
3,Roy deserves better prints,You can't beat these Roy Rogers classics-'Sheriff Of Tombstone' is one of the best westerns ever- and the tin is excellent but the prints of these movies are dreadful-they have been hacked off at the top probably to fit the TV screenings in the 50s-those guys who did that should have been shot by Roy- I would gladly have paid $50 plus for good prints of these movies. Guess I'll have to wait until better prints come along and stuff them in the tin!
3,Wow new is not better,"Wow,I am in the market for new DVD Roy Rogers movies, I was getting ready to puch the bitton to buy this item ubtil I read the review. WOW new does not always mean better!"
5,A Classic,"This book is a classic. Barnaby's insight on the game is straight forward and to the point. I've been a tennis professional for 20 years and met many pro's that consider this book the ""one to have"" in their collection."
1,"Awful, awful recording quality!","This is not even 96kbps MP3 quality. The sound is so muffled and tinny that it's almost a noise hazard at normal volume. This CD is absolute garbage. Don't waste your money on this one and look for another Estela Nunez compilation.Este disco es de tan mala calidad que un MP3 de la mas baja compresion suena mejor. Las canciones tienen un sonido ofensivo al oido en el fondo que suena como ""lata."" No tiren su dinero en esta basura y compren otro disco de Estela Nunez que no sea de esta compania."
2,So-so,"Curvature doesn't line up well with wok. Surface area too small. Although not stiff enough, the Good Grips is far better."
2,The handle was broke in 1/2,"Really shouldn't rate this product coz it was broken when it arrived (handle broken in half). I did get a full refund from Amazon (no trouble), customer service was excellent (5 starts for Amazon customer service!)."
5,Awesome Spat.,"Perfect for woking. When I recieved mine, the corner of the spatula was cracking so I had to peel back the crack and rub it on the corner of the table to dull it. Nothing that bad, just upsetting to buy something already messed up. Oh well. Excellent overall spat."
2,Very poor quality,Very disappointed in this bamboo spatula. The spatula end is poorly formed. The carving is very uneven on the sides and end. There are very obvious sanding marks in the bowl. If it wasn't such a hassle I'd return it.
1,Non- water resistant,"Despite it says WR 10 ATM on the display, it is NOT.Even when you wash your hands gets water inside.It's almost impossible to read the subdials.I strictly NOT recomend this watch."
4,Best animated show since Amazing Friends,"I don't like the Spider Boy look of Spider Man these days and the show has him look like an 11 year old. Aunt May also looks 18 years old with white hair but it doesn't matter. The show is geared towards kids which makes me easily look past the art style. Its fantastic and a lot of fun to watch much like the 80's Amazing Friends. Fun, doesn't take itself too seriously and cool stories.The action is true Spider Man style and the stories are very good and fun to watch for the whole family. I do not think there will be a 3rd season but after watching about 8 episodes I can easily say this a very good quality Spider Man series that any Spiderman fan would enjoy. Highly recommended!Now lets bring an older Spiderman to the animated screen!"
5,Spectacular indeed!!!,"Everything about this series is fantastic. The characters are well-developed, the animation is fast and furious, and the writing is intelligent and cohesive. You'll see both Peter Parker and Spider-Man adjust to life in high school and fighting super-villains in the big city. While individual episodes are satisfying, the season set really lets the viewer appreciate the continuity, making the saga of Spidey something of an ongoing epic. I cannot recommend this series enough, and I hope many more season sets will come in the future."
5,Great for younger kids,"I find this to be a toned down version of spider man that is good for younger kids. My son is 8 and I haven't let him watch the others yet and this gives him a taste of it without being as intense. There's still some fighting and bad guys, but spidey is a teenager and it isn't quite as violent or scarey as the others can sometimes be. Got the review from Common Sense Media which really helped me find it."
4,The Long View,The 29 year old book was in very good condition considering. This is the third time I have purchased this wook
3,"After a ""Young Rissa"" that was so good, a disappointing finish to the trilogy.","For me, this last volume in the trilogy just dissolved into all sorts of talk and blather and as in volume two--but even more so--way too much time devoted to the characters preparing food and drink, eating and drinking, and dining together--padding, it seemed to me, that did not really serve to advance the story, and kept interrupting the flow.In the end, Rissa et al just replacing a very harsh dictatorship with a much more benevolent one with them on top, running the show and trying to grasp a form of immortality."
4,Excellent book,"It's an excellent book. It does chemistry in a much more logical tone, doesn't have the distinct separations that others do. It probably wouldn't serve as a good primary book to use for learning chemistry but it would be a good review book to quickly brush up on the topic. I read bits and parts of it when brainstorming how to teach a HS chemistry class.-c"
5,Another excellent book in the 4 views format,"""Show Them No Mercy"" deals with some of the most troubling aspects of the Bible.In a nutshell, this work has four excellent scholars discussing and debating the topic summed up in 1 Samuel 15:1-3 Samuel said to Saul, ""The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the LORD. Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I will punish the Amalekites for what they did in opposing the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt. Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and INFANT, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'""How does that divine call to slaughter men, women, and children, compare to the teachings and values Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior taught and lived out?To learn more, but ""Show Them No Mercy"" and read a quality discussion about this very interesting, and in many ways troubling aspect of divine revelation.Thanks"
1,Why does e-edition cost so much?,Why in the world would I pay more for the electronic copy than the paperback version? Someone has lost touch with reality if they think an electronic copy of anything costs more to produce than a hard copy. E-books should be no more than $5. Ever! Prove to me where the cost justification comes from and I will pay $14 for the electronic copy. Ready? Go.
4,An attempt at a defense of Hebraic genocide,"An attempt at a defense of Hebraic genocide. The most incisive of the articles is the one by C. S. Cowles. The other three authors basically accept the traditional view with little else to add to the discussion.In other words, three of the authors find that Yahweh-ordered genocide is not a real problem to one's faith."
1,Awful Book!,"This group of essays was not at all what I thought it would be-based on the info I read. The second and third essay do explain some terminology and the context of Biblical language, but otherwise, this is strictly for students of theology.If you're looking for a non-religious, objective, historical account of the Canaanite genocide DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! If, however, you want an Evangelical apologia, go for it!"
4,Some notes from the artist.,".Not very professional to review your own material, but .. tough.I simply wanted to include some comments from peoplewho have actually PURCHASED this CD.""gorgeous sound quality"" NC""just what I wanted"" KY""nice ocean sounds .. packaged well"" AZ""item just as described .. thanks !"" OR"
2,Lot's of inconsistencies and inaccuracies!,"This book is one of the better Riva books (and that is not saying much!)....aside from typos and bad printing, there are a few inaccuracies and errors in the information presented. This book is something you give to someone whom is a bookworm and already has everything! Not a great piece of literature nor anything remotely scholastic."
4,Great stapler,This stapler keeps up with the high traffic and usage in a large corporate law firm. Have had no problems at all.
5,Tommy Steele,"Having all the Tommy Steele hits on a 2 cd set is great. Tommy was the first British Rock n Roll singer. He later became a movie star , many of his movies were released or filmed in the US.A great cd for anyone who wants all the hits."
2,Baseball's most over-rated player ?,"This book celebrates Ryan, but look at these numbers:A terrible batter: .134 slugging avg., awful fielder .895 fielding percentage. Led the league in hit batsmen 6 times, and has the worst career total ever. Led the league in losses once, only once in the top 3 in wins. Allowed the most walks 8 times, career total worst overall. Never led the league in Games Started. Pitched in only 1 World Series game."
3,Hand Cart,"The hand cart did not work properly from the start, but because we needed to use it for a project right away, we kept it. However, when we tried to use it again recently, the handle mechanism broke, rendering the cart unusable. The 3rd Party Amazon Seller decided to stick to their 30-Day return policy & refused to replace the item. So I contacted the manufacturer of the cart, & they willingly sent out a replacement.I understand that the Seller has a stated return policy, but I think they demonstrated poor business practice in this transaction. Moreover, their unwillingness to work with me reflects badly on Amazon."
1,broken stapler,"This ""heavy duty"" stapler is anything but. The tab holding in the staples is a light piece of plastic that breaks off after a year or two of use. How dumb can they be making a heavy duty metal staple dependent on a crappy little plastic tab"
5,Works for us,"We are a small business office but we have a need for stapling larger documents.I'm impressed with how much this stapler can go through.We are using the 1/2"" staples and haven't had any issues so far - but we aren't heavy users either."
5,QUALITY PRODUCT,HAVE ALWAYS HAD GOOD LUCK WITH STANLEY PRODUCTS VERY DURABLE AND OF QUALITY MADE.I HAVE NO DISLIKES FOR THIS PRODUCT.
2,NG,Either the stapler is terrible or the bostich staples need to be redesigned to go through 1/2 inch of papper without crushing the staples.
1,READ THIS BOOK,"Most serious historians/epigraphers/archaeologists would NOT reccommend this book to ANYone, much less to an impressionable undergraduate. However, grad students should not miss it for an entertaining summer read. You all need to be able to recognize poor scholarship, intellectual bias, and sloppy writing when you see it. If, god forbid, the first amendment is ever repealed, this book should be thrown into the first bonfire. Dr. Castor at Franklin & Marshall College included this joke book on her ""essential reading"" list. I congratulate her on her sense of humor. If she was serious, shame on her. Please don't waste your time. Read Martha Roth's Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor and draw your own conclusions."
4,It was Ok,I notice that my skin looks so smooth and a live!! I heard that Vitamin E can help reduce an acne scar but I didn't see any difference on it.
5,Good product,"I like this pills, they are good, and they make my skin healthy, I love my daily dose of antioxidants yay! :D"
3,Love my health.,"I ordered these vitamins while stationed in Afghanistan. Not sure if vitamin brands are really any different than the next one, personally i do believe their all the same. However when i received them in the mail all the vitamins were stuck together inside the container. Which i suppose is to be expected considering the high temperatures they probably experienced during transit to the middle east. However i have a few colleagues who ordered different brands that came in a little better container and they received their products in perfect condition. I was able to separate the majority of the vitamins in the container and it really wasn't a problem. Other than that i have no complaints with this product and take them regularly."
1,"Confirming ""Kathy with a K""","After reading Kathy's comment I researched this product. It was verified that this particular formula of Vitamin E is not that great, did not say toxic, but did say it was synthetic and there are much better choices on the market, exactly as Kathy mentioned. The supplier may have done their part in shipping; but, if the product is inferior, shipping is irrelavent. Thanks Kathy!"
2,Vitamin E Softgels,"I purchased Kirkland Vitamin E Softgels in July, and they were shipped July 29. I put the bottle in the refrigerator until needed, which was today, September 19, 2011. When I opened the bottle, all the pills were stuck together, as if melted. I had not noticed this when I originally unpacked the bottle, but it might have been the case. Unfortunately, I have missed the return window, so I am out $16.50. The pills are almost impossible to separate without breaking them. I am disappointed in the product. Possibly it happened in shipping it--but the shipper ought to be more careful about protecting temperature-sensitive products. Since I am not sure if the pills are still safe to take, I am forced to discard them. Lesson: look carefully when you receive your shipment. Make sure the pills are OK.Barbara Goldowsky"
5,Pioneer Family,"I must say I am biased on my opinion of this book, since the family is part of my heritage. My grandmother is the little girl named Ella who made a doll for the young boy, Hugie. I will reread this book time and time again and pass it onto my children.Peggy Hansen"
2,Frustrating Stapler,"I purchased this stapler because I had used one (same model), for about three years, that worked great. However, this new one is horrible. It jams constantly, blank staples 15/20 times and when you get down to about the last 20 staples it won't staple at all anymore--it makes the stapling motion/sound, but no staple actually comes out. I did find that if I use Swingline brand staples that it doesn't jam and blank staple nearly as often, but the one I had before which was the exact same model worked fine with any kind of staple. Overall I've not been nearly as happy with the new Swingline Electric Staples as I was with the old one."
1,These are cheap garbage...avoid at all costs,I have had 3 of these break in 2 years. Don't waste your money. They are made cheaply and jam easily.
2,Cheap but gets the job done.,It has a cheap sound when you stable. Light weight thus easy to move when inserting paper. Would have liked a heavier product. No outside guide to position paper for stapling.
4,Electric Stapler,"The product is what I had expected and so far it works well. I was hoping that it would be smaller in size, but I am still satisfied."
3,Hello,I purchase these phones as add-ons to my exisiting phone/answer. Had to return them. They worked well with each other but were not compatible to my main phone.Rbabe
3,Panasonic Cordless Phone,"This maybe a good phone, I just dont care alot for it. To me it is hard for me to understand all that it can do and then I dont remember the commands.( must be an old age thing ) It does charge nicely and it stays charged. I like the answering machine features. I like the ring tones that are louder than my old phones. It is easy to hold and does fit the ear nicely."
4,"Great product, simple set up","Great product. Wanted a phone in an area where there was no phone plug and in an office where electrical outlets at a premium. Chose this product due to phone and ratings/feedback. Placed base in kitchen and handsets near TV and in office (purchased additional handset). Works great! Easy to set up/save numbers (viewable on all phoes), no phone plug or electrical outlet needed for handsets. Great sound quality, answering machine a plus (haven't used yet) didn't mind caller ID voice - actually wait to hear it if not near phone. Also like that phones stand upright so you can see who is calling and easily pick up (no more leaning over the phone to read Caller ID). Wasn't sure upright phone would work in kitchen, but it does; placement is key. Office phone works well which is farthest away from base. No complaints, very happy, highly recommend."
3,"Phone okay, but Battery died very soon","Within a few months the batter was getting hot. I thought something was wrong and a friend told me it was the batter trying to charge when it is, too, old.I think they asked way, too, much for the phone, but needed a match. I would have not bother with it had I known they would not even put a new battery in it for the price I paid."
5,Panasonic phone,The phone is great. Am very pleased with its ease of operation and the range. We have never been disappointed with Panasonic products.
4,Nice phone system with one important shortcoming,"I just added a fourth handset (maximum) to this system. I've been using it for well over a year now and am pretty well satisfied. That said, there are two features missing that boggle my mind that Panasonic missed them:1. There is no audible alert option for new messages, so if you come home you had better notice the little blinking red light. I never do!2. There is no ringer volume control.Both of these are pretty basic features. Panasonic just screwed up.Otherwise, a really good product: good range, nice design, easy to use."
4,good practice pad,"Good product, the only thing is that it wobbles a little bit. I had to put it against my bed frame to a solid backbone for it. It has great response and has taken my double pedal abuse seriously. One of my students just purchased the same pad and copied my set-up.I wish it would be fully collapsable just like the DW one, and that included a carring case/bag."
1,Does not fit all bannisters,I tried to use this on my banister and it did not fit. My banister has a wide base and narrower top. The area it would have fit was slightly above where it needed to be. We actually were able to install the gate on the bannister with out using the kit even though the instuctions that come with the gate say that if you have a bannister you need the kit. I would reccomend an attempt to install the gate without the extra attachments before ordering them.
2,Disappointed,"I have a rod iron bannister. I thought this would help me install a baby gate.It is intended for round or diamond shaped bannisters. Of course, my is square. I had a horrible time trying to return it to a Babies R Us store. They did not want to return it because they did not sell this item in the store. That's why I bought it through Amazon."
3,Ok product,"Good concept poor design. I purchased the kit to install my dream baby gate at the bottom of the stairs. The kit comes in three pieces to help fit all banister sizes but with my banisters size it was either to big or to small. Also the screws that came with the kit were to short, I had to go and purchase my own screws that fit, granted they were only $1.00."
1,Caution before buying,I would caution anyone to really make sure you NEED this before buying it. ANB's return policy stinks and you will be stuck with a useless product like myself. It only works on very small banister I guess because our mid-sized banister was way too big. Because of the 7 days to return it that I think should have been highlighted upon purchase we lost money on this and now have a product that is useless and will now fill a landfill. I will not purchase from their company again because of this product and their poor return policy.
3,fine for small banisters,"It only fits our banisters at the top, but other than that it works fine. Although the bottom we zip-tyed to the banister, which isn't pretty, but works great and is much cheaper than this kit. Wish I would of just thought of the zip-tyes to start with instead of wasting the money on this."
1,Problem with CD 1,"I love the music but CD 1 has a serious flaw. Track 14 (Et j'ai le mal de toi) is incomplete, while tracks 15 to 18 are completely missing. I can't believe this sloppiness from the producer. The CDs I got was made by Bibus Records in Canada."
3,bunnies,"This product was not what I expected. I expected a larger blanket with a larger ""Lily Mae"" frog. It is too ""pricey"" for the product."
5,I LOVED IT!,"This has got to be my favorite book of all time! It was informative, but not to informative. I love this kind of book. I am 14 and fat, so this book really made me realize any size is okay, even though 14 is a bit old for this book. I recomend it for ages 9-11. READ IT!"
2,"Does not perform, or as powerful as advertized.","I am glad that we purchased the more powerful pump. It is now obvious that a lesser pump would not have worked. This pump can barely raised enough water to the 4' height necessary, that our garden fountain was intended. We know now that our orginal, less powerful pump, was not defective, it just was not powerful enough.Beckett 7061310 350gph Submersible Pump with 16' Cord"
4,May I Be Bleak?,"Still highly churning out among the best black metal the scene has to offer, Clandestine Blaze continue on their path of skull-crushing, Christ-bashing and still sound as fresh and as true as they did with their earlier work. Though I was a fan of their previous albums and E.P.s ('Below the Surface of Cold Earth' being among my favorite black metal albums), I seemed to enjoy 'Delivers of Faith' more than I expected. That album is a very slight progression to a colder, more surreal sound ala Sear Bliss, specifically from their last full length 'Fist Of The Northern Destroyer' (though still a solid album). Mind you I speak not of some sort of progression to becoming some sort of faux black metal band (name dropping here seems inappropriate) but to just a different level of sheer intensity. Clandestine Blaze delivers not only the faith but some of the most exciting and trance-inducing black metal heard in awhile.8.5 / 10"
3,Ms. John Soda - While Talking,"Ms. John Soda embrace their odd vision of pop with _While Talking_, an EP that bops along quite nicely. ""No. One"" has some jangly guitars that give way to a more thoughtful cello section before diving back into the forceful guitar work somewhat numerically. There's less electronic work here than on many other Morr Music releases, but this is in no way a weakness. Subtle get their hands on ""I & #8217"" and give it a beat-box and typewriter treatment, while ""If Someone Would Know"" takes on a melancholy country-western twang. Finally, ""I Think It Could Work, Marilyn"" features a spoken-word piece, and imaginary conversation between Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley, presumably. Kitschy, but entertaining nonetheless."
4,Dvd,This company did a great job on getting this DVD out quickly. It was in great condition andbi would definately purchase from them again thank you
5,"A stunning, deeply moving novel of Kashmir","More vivid, and yet more true to life than any non-fiction account of the war torn mountain paradise of Kashmir this extraordinary book brings the place alive in all its beauty and horror. You get a visceral sense of the gorgeousness of Kashmir: the mountain light on the lakes, the scent of the pine forests, the handsomeness and humor of the people. But it also takes you deep into a brutal counter-insurgency war in a way that is fair to all sides but brings home the human cost of violence. Indeed there are times in 'the Wonder House' when it's all but impossible not to cry. This is one of the most important and powerful novels written about South Asia in many years."
1,Extremely disappointing,"My eyes happened to caught the cover of The Wonder House as I made my way out of the bookstore. I was elated to discovery that the story took place in my homeland- Kashmir. However, I was throughly disappointed after finishing the book at the complete lack of historic accuracy and the biased against the Indian army. Besides the factual portion of the novel, I wasn't impressed by the writing style- at certain times extremely noncongruent, choppy sentences. The jumping around of different viewpoints made the novel diffiult to follow.Also I wish the author had concluded the novel with a little more death. The murder of the main character was left completely unresolved."
5,"Harry Potter books are a wonderful gift, or read them yourself.","I have read all the Harry Potter books out so far, 1-6, and truly enjoyed them all. I bought the boxed set to give one book at time to my granddaughters, as we read them together over the phone. This is a wonderful way to establish a relationship with a child you don't see often. We read almost every day and then talk about what we've read. I am currently reading with four grandchildren and they just love the story and love reading with me. They can't wait to see what happens next! Hopefully, they will always remember reading Harry Potter with grandmom, and then read with their own children as they get older."
1,Love Harry Potter Hate Quality of these books,Probably one of the biggest fan of the Potter series so please take this as a quality of the product NOT of the Potter series. These are the cheapest paperbacks I have ever seen! I have been in the book business 30 years and am shocked at how low quality these are. YOUR CHILD WILL ONLY GET ONE READING before the book falls apart! INVEST IN USED HARDBACK or look for the other paperbacks alone as this is not worth your money!
5,hp paperback boxed set,This is a very convenient way of getting your books all at once.The box is fine and the books are in good shape.
5,Magical,"I wanted the ""Harry Potter Paperback Boxed Set (Books 1-5)"" because they are lighter and will be easier to re-read than the hard cover. I had to put off reading Book 6 due to some other commitment, but am finally almost to the end and plan to start at the beginning of the series again when I finish ""The Half-Blood Prince"". Harry ROCKS!"
2,The Story-Telling Goes (WAY) Downhill!,"I didn't expect to not like the later books, but I don't. I had already read the first two books when I bought this set, and loved them. The third one I thought was too long, and a little boring at points, but I liked the end. And I just haven't been able to get even half way through the fourth book, it seems like a bizarre little soap opera filled with long (LOOOONG) conversations, details about trivialities like camping trips and especially way too much detail about quidtich (sp?), the weird (and dull) sport Harry is obsessed with, which has always been the weakest part of the books IMHO (I usually skim these parts). I hate sports.I really don't know if I will ever finish the series. The first two books were so tight, short, exciting and funny. I'm so let down."
2,harry potter and the order of the phoenix,the binding on this book broke and detached when i was less than half through this read. i am a 60 year old woman and not abusing this book.
3,OK - Harry Potter Boxed Set,"I was more concerned with the printed material of these books. The box was a bit flimsy and the books sometimes had ink blotches on the pages. For what I paid, $25, I think it was ok."
5,Love and Potter,"My husband and I have been reading these books together. They rock. And it's so nice to have the complete collection. Why am I telling you this? Everyone knows Harry Potter is awesome.Anyways, don't hesitate. Just buy it."
5,Great Books,"I loved these books, they are great easy books to read that keeps your attention going. I found myself having a hard time putting them down. I've read all the books in a couple of weeks.I loved how fast they were shipped to me as well."
5,Harry Potter books,I bought this set of books for my daughter and grandson in Miami and they arrived in a timely manner in great shape.
4,Presentation stinks,"I bought this set because I wanted all 5 books in hardback, but as another reviewer wrote, it is like they made a cheap outside cover for the box set of books 1-4 & threw in book five to make a ""new"" box set. Plus the bookmark is not real leather. The books themself are great. I recommend them all."
1,If you're going to waste money...,"...why not just give it to me? Yes, box sets are very nice, if they are COMPLETE. But, see, if you're paying any attention at all, there are TWO MORE of these books coming out! At least! So why in the world would you buy a box set that will have to have two more books sitting next to it in 4 years? If you're going to buy a box set, wait for the series to be DONE. Or at least for a box that will hold all of them."
5,Melissa C. and Dekotah L.,These Books were awsome. Hello!! Bye-bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Horn if your Honkey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,oh yes !! even an adult can enjoy !!!!!!,Best set of books I have ever read. Just sorry there is only one left.
4,Fun,"So all my friends were telling me I had to read Harry Potter. I got this book set to see what all the fuss was about. I've only read sorcerer's stone so far, but it's lots of fun, and if all of the other books are as fun then everybody was right. The boxed set itself is nice. It's colorful, seems pretty sturdy and the artwork is nice. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because even though I ordered it with the super saver shipping (which I know takes longer and is normally fine) it still took over a month before I got my books."
1,Potter - lucky fraud,"Never has so much been made of so little...Ms Rowling is incredibly lucky to have adapted her mediocre writing talents to a genre trodden by many before her (and trodden more effectively). Right place, right time is all i can say !"
1,Pathetic,These books were just pathetic. They are poorly written and the characters are flat and unrealistic. And the attemts at humor were also pathetic. Why are these books so popular? (...)
2,Product shipped not what description states,"All five books came and while they were used and in good quality(a little on the worn side but nothing too bad for older books), it did not come in the box and DOESN'T come with any leather book mark. It's still a great deal if you wanted to get these books and don't want to pay for indivudual brand new ones but just be warned they are all seperate books and are all very much used. Mine still had old price tags on them which told me they were from different shops to start with so never part of a set, let alone special edition or anything. Suprised they are getting away with such false statements."
5,Excellent Package,"Attractive packaging, sturdy boxed set of quality-bound paperbacks. An excellent buy for a collector or for someone who wishes to keep the books for a second or third read. Makes an excellent gift for a Harry Potter beginner as well."
1,Boxed sets should contain the WHOLE series,"Why would anyone want to buy books 1 - 5 in a boxed set when eventually there will be a total of seven books in the series? If you want to read the books and want the boxed set, borrow them and wait until the entire series comes out in a set. The books are great to read but this is a dumb way to sell them!"
1,About the Copy cats,"I can't say i hated this book, i atcually liked it, but here's the thing. A lot of people say other fantasy stories just rip off this one but honestly, this book is covering all the possible plot elements. A good-willed protaganist? Yep. Magic of some sort? Got it covered. Evil villian the hero miracoulsy overcomes against all odds? Check and check.And let's say someone writes about a main character who isn't good hearted, like pieces by Eion Colfer, Jonathon Stoud, Garth Nix or someone like that? Apperently it's not suitably for children.So stop saying everyone's cashing in on J.K. Rowling, becuase if you look at the publication dates, many books that follow that magical wizard good/bad storyline were pulished first. It really wasn't a big thing for J.K. Rowling to write this book, i mean, kind of predictiable storyline don't cha know?So keep the unhelpful's coming but heed my advice, just because it reminds you of Harry potter doesn't mean that it is Harry Potter."
4,Harry Potter is Good,"The books are a good read. Fun stuff.There is no god.Read the books if you like fantasy. Because that's what it is. ""FANTASY."" Not reality.By the way, there is still no god."
5,Not just for kids,"If you like the Harry Potter movies that have been released, you'll just love the books. The books aren't just for kids though, older audiences have fallen in love with these books, and it's clear why. The mystery of everything has us right there with Harry trying to solve whatever it is going on. Part of us becomes trapped inside this world, and loves every minute of it. This is no fairy tail of witches and wizards, this is an entire world created by J.K. Rowling that has captured our minds and our hearts, and takes us away from reality. If you like to settle down with a book and be able to read it for long periods of time, then this book is for you. With so much happening, you won't want to put it down."
5,Very Nice Set o' Books,"So much has been written about Harry that I'm not even going to try. This set, however, is another matter. It's great to have the first five books all in one box, lined up on the shelf, all one size, and in complementary colors. THey're bound well, and the illustrations are terrific."
2,Hated it,"I am completely dumbfounded by this book's popularity. Half the story serves no purpose whatsoever; it is merely the author's own sick indulgence. I actually hoped that the entire plot would turn out to have some meaning or provide an explanation for these apparently unnecessary scenes. The other shortcomings of this book are trivial in comparison. Among the most distracting features of the book is the extremely juvenile dialogue. It is understandable that the author would attempt to contrast the children's emotionally immaturity with their advanced intellect, but instead the children come across as intellectually dumb and dumber emotionally. Try something original like Robert Stanek's The Kingdoms and the Elves or In the Service of Dragons."
5,Nice starter set,"I have read all the HP books, but was borrowing them from my sister. Once #6 came out, I knew I needed to read #5 to refresh my memory. I came across the box set, and it is perfect to go back to for a refresher, but also excellent to add onto as more books come out."
5,Useful literature!,"Literature that considers communication system problems, tends to be either too practical (not general enough, providing only ""ad hoc-solutions""), or theoretical to the extent that the desired ""real-world property"" is lost (or hopelessly hidden...). This book is a true exception, giving a well-balanced mix of theory and practice, presented in a most understandable and inspiring way. A broad range of relevant communication system problems (for the taken approach, probably all (?)) are discussed, practically all of which are dealt with in a multi-commodity, network optimization fashion. The book is self-contained in the sense that the prerequisites are covered by its appendices. In my opinion, a book of this type (there are not many!) is essential whether you are an engineer or a researcher in this field, simply because that it constitutes a ""missing link"" between theory and practice."
5,best budget phono preamp,"As has been stated in other reviews, this is the BEST budget preamp under $30 (even $50). I hooked it up to my old Pioneer direct driveTT with a Grado black cartridge, and it delivered great sound with no hum. The output level could be a little higher, butit was enough for my new Pioneer AV receiver. Excellent fidelity!"
4,Works well,"I have used this product to convert my old vinyl LP's to CD's with my computer and so far it has worked very well. It has been easy to hook up and use, and I have had no background noise. I am satisfied with this product."
2,It works some of the time,"I bought this about a year ago in 2010. Like similar products, it was very easy to set up. Within a few months I noticed that one speaker or another would occasionally fail when starting a record side. I used to be able to fix this by jiggling the L and R connectors on the back. It wasn't a big deal, I could live with it. More recently, in order to get it to work again, I've had to disconnect the power supply and reconnect it. It seems to solve the problem, but I can't really say I'm satisfied with this product. Now it happens every time I start an album side, which equals a lot of unplugging and re-plugging. I got what I paid for, a few months of use. Time to upgrade."
4,Behringer PP400 not bad at all,"I'm in Australia, so I needed an expensive power convertor (about 100 AUS) to make this work properly, but that was expected. There is a bit of a hum when I turn it on, but once a record is playing through it, it sounds great and boosts the signal effectively. Great stuff."
4,Great Preamp for the Price,"I bought this preamp for a Technics M5G turntable that I connect to a VCI-300. The VCI-300 has no preamp for the auxiliary input so this was necessary.For the price, this thing works great. It does exactly what I wanted it to do.Other reviews mention a hum sound and I definitely hear it.However, I use my turntable just for scratching so the hum isn't an issue for me and the preamp was only 20 bucks. I really wish it had an on/off switch, you need to unplug it to turn it off.Price and preamp = 5 starsHum and lack of on/off switch = minus 1 star"
3,"It works, but not for classical music","The preamp arrived when it was scheduled, was easy to set up, and works OK for normal music. However, if you have a sophisticated sound system, the music tends to be a bit tinny. There is too much emphasis on the treble and mid range at the expense of the low end. Fortunately, I was able to find (rather hard to do locally) an amp with a phone input and that solved my problem."
4,Can't beat the price,"The phono stage went down on my Dynaco preamp the other day. I am a vinyl nut and I love my records.I am in the middle of building a tube phono preamp but it is not ready to put in to service, so I needed something quick and cheap to allow me to play my records.This little preamp is alright. Rock and most Jazz sounds pretty good but with classical and piano it lacks detail in the middrange and highs but what do you expect for less than $30.00."
5,No Complaints! Great Machine!,"Seriously guys, this is great. It totally improved my sound, and I was able to ground my turntable. sounds fantastic. got rid of the annoying hum in some turntables. THIS IS WHAT GIVES YOU THAT VINYL SOUND."
3,Works great for what it is.,"I needed an inexpensive phono preamp until I could afford the one I really wanted. The PP400 fit the bill. It worked flawlessly, no hum hiss or noise at all. The gain is a little low compared to line level from my other devices, but that's nothing the volume control on my stereo cannot fix.I have however since moved on to a Yaqin MS-12B vacuum-tube based phono preamp. Comparing the two is not fair, as the Yaqin is $300 and the PP400 $20... but the PP400 was good enough, and I didn't know what I was missing until I hooked up the Yaqin... but the PP400 sounds pretty good for $20. If you're using big box store stereo systems (Best Buy, Walmart, etc) and an older turntable, this is a perfectly great sounding unit."
3,"Sounds good, no off switch","This is a great preamp, the sound quality coming from my Technics sl-1200 mkII turntable into a standard Yamaha receiver sounds quite good. Considering the low price this is definitely a good solution for people trying to use a turntable on a newer reciever that doesn't have a phono preamp.The downside of this preamp in my opinion is the lack of an off switch. I suppose that it's okay to keep it on but it seems wasteful of electricity and can't be good for the preamp itself. Additionally, when you pull the plug on the preamp it releases a bit of electricity which have caused my speakers to pop even when my amplifier is off, which also doesn't seem like a good thing.Overall a good preamp, it could be a bit more consumer friendly though."
3,works. but some problems and more buzzing than i would like,It works as advertised but it seems like the grounding isnt working properly. There is a buzzing most of the time unless i have the volume lower. otherwise works as it says it does
3,"Not enough, and what's that hum?","I bought this to solely amplify my newly acquired turntable and feed the signal to my home theater system. I found that I need to crank up the HTS in order to decently hear the music and there is a considerable hum, despite proper grounding. Perhaps its the turntable or the HTS, but I don't think this amp did not do the job well."
4,Does exactly what it is supposed to,"This little box does exactly what it is supposed to. My only quibble is that the power cord going into the device came undone and should have been wedged in better. The most terrific thing is that when I screwed in the ground wire from my turntable to the preamp, the hum vanished/"
3,"Cheap, but gets the job done","I bought this preamp to use with an old belt-drive turntable. For its target market, it's just fine - easy set-up, functional, and small. There's a bit of hum that comes wit the unit, but it's not noticeable if you're playing music at a high volume (use the ground pin if your turntable has one, or there will be even more noise). For spoken word records, however, the static really gets in the way.Bottom line: it's a cheap way to use your phono-out record player, but look for something pricier if you want high-quality sound."
3,"Basic, but get's the job done.","Wanted a compact preamp with more than one output option and this is it.The only thing I do not like is the fact that there is no on/off switch and this has to be unplugged instead.Otherwise, does the job just fine."
5,Terrific new take on an old legend,"I just loved it. Not the violence, mind you, but the characters, the insights, the alternate way of telling the ancient tale. I cannot wait to read the next installment in the series, I believe titled simply ""Troy,"" and because it's not due in the U.S.A until next year, guess what, I am ordering it from amazon.uk, in September, when I will be in England!Of course the news of his passing saddened me deeply, and yes, selfishly, I wondered about if he had written the third installment in this proposed 3 book series. I see from other reviews here that I am not the only one feeling ""selfish"", and I believe this is the greatest post-partum gift an author can receive from his loyal readers.Lord of the Silver Bow is not for the purists. But it's for those who love the legend of Troy, and enjoy the adventure of reading yet another take, with fresh twists and turns.I hope you are writing up storms in Heaven, David!"
4,A good start,"I was a little worried at first; the book gets off to a slow start. After about 100 pages or so, things start to get interesting. The writing is pretty good even though the characters (except for Odysseus) are pretty flat. The plot (despite a few silly parts) is interesting. Unfortunatly, the ending is rather predictable. Still, this is one of the best books of this genre that I've read. I enjoyed it enough to order the rest of the trilogy.Recommended."
4,A solid reworking of the Troy story,"I knew nothing of Gemmell before reading this book. Perhaps that was a good thing. While reading I could feel elements of his proficiency in fantasy but it remained a strong work of historical fiction.That said, it lured me in slowly. I was not immediately taken with the tale or its characters. But as I perservered I became entranced with the story and eventually found it very difficult to put down.It is a solid reimagining of the events surrounding and particularly leading up to the famous battle for Troy and focusses largely on one major character Helikaon/Aneas of Dardania - and what a character he is.For anyone interested in a good historical fiction read, the bronze age or Ancient Greek History and the Trojan saga in particular this is a worthy addition to the library."
5,Great Series,I have loved this book and series for years. Happy to finally own my own copy. Suggested to all. :)
4,Good book.,Students seem to enjoy this book. It is checked out a great share of the time from my classroom. I have had several students write book reports on it.
3,Roman Buff,"I thought all parts that were fiction were well done; I think it strayed a little too far from the Iliad for my personal enjoyment.The book starts off slow - but I liked it so much - I did read the next two in the series - it was all well worth my time and very entertaining.My only con for this series; and it is subjective; is that I did not like the modern morals which were given to many of the characters. I felt it was out of place and a little too indulgent of our times. Still, we are the ones to buy it, eh?Realize as you read this review that I did read all 3 books - so that tells you it is well worth the purchase price."
1,What the heck?,"I don't know which book the previous reviewers were talking about, but this book contains NONE of the stories they said. It is Volume 12 of 15 (which was NOT disclosed by Amazon) and seems to be the second half of a story from Volume 11 and God knows what the other story is; I had never heard of either of them. I will be returning this book, though now I am a bit leery of ordering something that I am not at all familiar with.Perhaps previous reviewers were commenting on Volume 1?"

4,Great Portuguese stories....,"Of Portuguese heritage and having several relatives that came to California from Portugal(Azores) I am enjoying these stories, and also purchased one for my sister."
2,Disappointing and very poorly written.,"As the daughter of Portuguese immigrants, I had very high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver in terms of quality. Although it was a very admirable concept, the book was very poorly written and organized, embarrassingly so. The book is worthwhile in terms of its ambition, that is, to document the lives and contributions of Portuguese immigrant women. If taken simply for that, it certainly has some value. Do not expect any eloquence or flow, however."
4,KC high lites rock,Purchased these after many many months of debate and was very impressed.the light covers came with broken tabs but after contacting amazon they gave me a partial credit/refund and then KC sent me two new covers after emailing them..quality and bright and best of all they dont rust like the cheap knockoffs
5,KC's are Best,"I installed these on my 1970 Landcruiser, on the top rail of my brush guard. I have an older pair of identical KC's on the lower inside rail. Both are on seperate circuits. These are the best off road lights on the market, and defineatly worth there weight in gold. I recommend these to anyone that wants quality at a super price, and they are easy to install. These are especially usefull when finding my way back to hunting camp is a storm or pitch dark. These turn the night into daylight"
4,still a winner.,"KC daylighters are great off road lights, there a classic design and work well. The only downside is that time marches on and better products come out (H.I.D.) I have these on the front of my silverado and there a good ""pencil"" beam spotlight, for the price there a great value on off road lighting. I do however plan to upgrade the lights on my truck to something a little more modern, Like HID'S for a classic look and good function these are a good buy, for the serious offroader that demands very bright lights.. thre are some brighter options out there."
5,"Finally, all the TMBG videos in one place! Outstanding.","TMBG fans must have. Note the early low tech but high energy style. John and John are excited to perform. The bigger budget videos follow, and the latter show a restrained use of sets and camera that comes with less cash for production. The music remains the best kept secret in rock, the videos serve as a chronologically reversed study of the duo. People paid 40 or 50 bucks to get the 1986-88 TMBG tape on e-bay. Here's your chance to see why."
4,Great collection but...,"The collection is great but on the John & John commentary, John Linnell is extremely hard to hear which is extremely dissapointing."
5,So Happy!!!,"This book was a gift to my mother. She has been a quilter for over 50 years and she has fallen in love with this fasinating book. She has already started a new project from it and is thrilled with the books contents as it has projects she has never come acrossed here in the states. The book came quickly, was in exellent condition and I am completely happy with the vendor. Will buy from them again!!"
4,Quality product at a reasonable price,"I was looking to purchase floor-standing drill press when I realized I have no place to put it. Instead of a desktop press, I decided to try this out, seeing it had good reviews and was fairly inexpensive. For what I needed it for (straight holes, boring larger holes, horizontal grinding, etc.) this product is terrific. I've only used it a few times, but so far it has lived up to expectations."
5,GREAT to use as eyelet setter,"If you build vintage amps with eyelets this is the best possible tool you can buy without spending a bundle. Nothing gets near this price point. It is a drill press stand with a chuck that lets you press the eyelets easily. Unfortunately, I have been trying to buy another one or two, and called the company only to find it has been long discontinued because it was not a big seller. I checked all over (even Europe) and found none in the pipeline and never you see one sold used. I will now have to buy a small drill press, which is more bulky to duplicate what this does for me."
4,A Great Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed The Lady of Sorrows. After finishing The Ill-made Mute, I had to start this 2nd volume. The style of writing and use of language is just beautiful and I enjoyed it as much as the story itself. Some parts of the book are drawn out and the poor heroine always seems to be having to set out of some very long journey mainly undertaken on foot in extreme conditions. This aside the plot has a number surprises and new characters together with it being so beautifully written it keeps you turning the pages. The author's knowledge of folklore is just amazing."
3,A reasonable attempt to emulate more scholarly writers,"Generally I dislike criticising books but I am afraid some of the language usage in the Lady of the Sorrows is disappointing. I would certainly never claim that the author's vocabulary is not impressively voluminous, however, she does have a tendancy to use some words in - to put it politely - a very liberal way. It is quite possible that she is perfectly aware of the slightly grating tone in some of her sentences (I wouldn't dream of damping down poetic expression!) but it does make reading her book something of a chore. That is not necessarily a disadvantageous trait (Gene Wolfe and James Joyce both write books that are incredibly difficult to follow in places) but Ms. Dart-Thornton's meagre plot twists seem not to justify the effort.Despite this failing, I would not wish to discourage readers from attempting this trilogy and I, personally, will reserve my final decision for after I have read the final installment."
5,The second in an excellent series!,I thought the Ill-Made Mute was really boring - I had to keep pushing myself to finish the book it was that bad. The end of Ill-Made Mute was just enough to make me borrow 'Lady of the Sorrows' from a friend. I loved it! It was sooooooo much better than the first in what should be an excellent series and I rushed out to buy a copy for myself! CDT left the readers with Imrhien/Rohain/Ashalind discovering her past - which sets us up for an amazing finale!I am eargerly awaiting the third book!
3,"Loved the First Book, but Not so Much on the Second","I really loved the author's first book, but I felt she lost the main plot in the second book. It was still brillently written, but the when the main character found her past, it convuluted the plot. I began to question whether the basic facts about the main character were acurate from the first book. In the first book the character starts out as a small child, but the second book hints that she was much older at that time? I got confused."
4,The Lady of the Sorrows,This book was as great as the first one in the trilogy. A fantasy that just kept you wanting to read on and on. I can hardly wait for the third and final installment to see how it all pans out for the leading character with all that she has found out about herself.
3,Lady of Sorrows,This book rambled on a bit. It also used ideas from fairy tales that are common. I kept skipping because I lost interest in places. I liked the last book somewhat better.
2,Can wait for the 3rd book,I read this series when it first came out and wish I had stopped at book 1. The writing style is agonizing to read. The story and concept is excellent but the writing style drags on and on. I've never read a romance novel but I expect it would sound like many parts of this book. I read the whole series and unfortunately each one gets to be more and more like a romance novel. Reading this series was somewhat tolerable as you can just skip over pages and pages of the descriptive text and not miss a thing. It's really ashame because there was so much potential here and I really wanted to like this series. The faerie lore is the only redeeming quality and the reason for the second star.
4,Many threads deftly woven,"I enjoyed the Ill-Made Mute so much, I was prepared to be disappointed by the next installment, but my fears were unfounded. Dart-Thornton has taken threads of story from Celtic and European myths, landscapes from fairytale and the Australian bush and characters that transcend the stereotype. I won't discuss the plot - suffice to say there are a few moments when you will stop and think ""A-Ha! Thats why...."" Enjoy!"
2,Margaret Australia,"I waited with baited breathe for this book, the 3rd in the series. I was very disappointed in the final book. Ms Dart-Thornton went into long winded discriptions, which bored the life out of me. The book just fell flat compared to the last two books."
1,Hardback - Waste of money,"I bought the hardback and sincerely regretted it! ....!The language was archaic with the 'Thee' 'thous' 'prithees' you just could not empathise with the characters! To me the story was a bunch of folk and fairy tales compiled with the authors characters inserted and experiencing them first hand. It would have been better reading a fairy tale book. The mystery of the main character is nothing amazing infact down right dissappointing. In conclusion, disappointing, boring and a bloddy waste of money!!!!"
5,Great Book,This is the best book you or anyone could ever read.I loved it! It leaves everyone wanting to find out what will happen just like the first. This books was worth the wait.I recommand this book to anyone wanting to read something good.
5,Read This Book!,"If you liked the first book, you'll love this one. The story is faster, but not so much that it changes the rhythm of the story significantly. There are a lot of twists, and while I was able to guess correct answers to a few of the mysteries, many confounded me until their revelation (and there are indeed many things revealed about the protagonist's past). The plot is very well crafted, the characters realistic, and the heroine lovable. I definately recommend this book."
3,Not Bad but Not Needed,"This is sort of the greatest hits of Kid Songs. If you have the other movies in the series, which we already did, you don't need this one. It's basically just a recap of some of the songs from the others."
3,We'll see...,"My 10 month old loves music and I thought she would enjoy this dvd, but she lost interest very fast. I think she prefers us :) singing with her or animated shows...We'll give it a few months and then see if she is interested."
2,Not Worth It -- Spring for the Real Machines,"I wanted my own cardio machine for my house but I had such a tight budget when I bought this. It might seem like a fair price, but I received no directions, the ""heart monitor"" in the center never worked no matter how many times I changed the batteries or pressed the one giant plastic button, and the whole thing is just so wobbly and fake. It feels like it's going to fall apart when I get on it -- and mind you, I'm a 101lb female! You can TELL it's the cheap version as you use it, which isn't pleasant. Not to mention, there isn't any elliptical action -- it's a straight forward and back sliding motion, so it's a very uncomfortably stiff walking sensation and therefore I don't feel like I'm burning that much or sweating at all or doing any real workout, even after 30 minutes. I would not recommend this at all. Save your money and buy a true elliptical because I'm sure THAT will be worth it."
4,"A great, compact exercise apparatus",Don't buy this item if you weigh over 400 lbs! It is a light duty but durable exercise machine. I recommend it to anyone who wants to stay healthy.
1,Damaged Merchandise,I orderd this for delivery within the United States. Yet the mug arrived chipped. I had to throw it away. I am also very disappointed with the overall quality of the pieces. They were made in China and made rather poorly.
1,Tao radios are defective,"After receiving radio and trying to figure out how to get operating, I realize the batteries are defective. I had to sign up for XM radio to get replacement batteries. So now, I am paying monthly fee without a working radio. I recommend that NO ONE buy a TAO radio. They should be off the shelves if the batteries are defective and Amazon should be ashamed for selling the product. Last time I buy electronics on line!!!!!!"
2,Broken,I've had this product for two years and now it no longer works. i wasn't realy happy with it when it arived. it was hard to adjust the screen so i could read it in bright light and at night without having to cover my head or adjust the settings. it seemed poorly made.
2,Too hard to use,"I got mine over a year ago and it's been on the shelf collecting dust most of the time. It was very difficult to work with - It was difficult to get reception and I could never get the volume to adjust.I was hoping for more of a ""plug-and-play"" experience and this is anything but.I've just renewed my XM subscription, so maybe I'll just get a new system that's actually usable."
2,Tao xm2go wanted to give it 5 stars,"Overall the concept is very good. Works great in my truck, works great in my home. Lots of road trips through the midwest and never had lost signal issues. I even brought it on a fishing trip near the Canada border and used my extra truck antenna. We were 2 hours from the nearest paved road and it worked great.But I've had this product since Dec of 2005 and have had to return it 3 times. I don't get reception at work so I like to record at night and playback the next day. Works great for about 2-3 months then no more sound on recorded material. Have to send it back and its on my dime and I have to live without it for about 3-4 weeks.I wish this product was made a little better. I wanted to give it 5 stars but 3 returns in 14 months not very good.The only thing I had to buy extra for this product was a holder for my truck otherwise it came with everything you need."
4,Good everyday work pants (very generous on the size),I like the pants. Easy care and looks good for everyday wear at work. But the size runs large. I love to shop online but can never figure out the size these days.
2,Too much plastic,"We bought two of these gates. One has been up for only a week, and we have already had two problems with it. The top of the gates was hard to keep secure (the part that locks it in place is plastic), and the second problem: the wind-up mechanism broke! This gate is almost made of ALL PLASTIC, inside and out. The plastic pieces that keep the spring loaded thing wound-up inside malfunctioned. We had to take the whole thing apart, it took us over an hour to fix it. If the gate was made out of a harder, stronger plastic, and had METAL pieces inside to keep it working well, it would be an awesome gate. It is good idea, and it is nice to have it out of the way when it is rolled up. BUT, for the price of this gate, it should not be made out so much plastic!"
4,"Good gate, but...","We have two of these gates (among others). One about 2 years older than the other. The older one has held up like new. A few words of caution. It's not the easiest to install due to the flexible nature of the gate. Can you do it? Yes, but it will take about an hour. Second, expect it simply to ""hold back"" your child from a room or a tumble down the stairs. That is, I wouldn't trust it to withstand a running start and certainly not a climb. For the top of a stairway, you might want to consider installing another type of gate. Third, one handed operation is virtually impossible. Not a problem for us, but simply something to know."
1,Be Warned!,"Our 10-month old was able to unlatch this gate and topple down the stairs. We had this gate properly installed at the top of our stairs by our contractor. We've been using the gate for a few months (since he started crawling) and had the same problems others mentioned (i.e., the button is not easy to maneuver and it is definitely not a one-handed operation). In addition, the gate would occasionally retract unevenly (the top would be out of line with the bottom) and the mesh looks like it is stretched out at the top. Don't rely on this product for your child's safety at the top of the stairs (I've reported the incident to the CPSC)."
2,Unique... But not robust.,"This retractable gate was used at the bottom of a staircase. It does indeed block it from small children. I didn't find anything else like it.Installation of course varies with the construction of your home. I had to adapt to make this one work. A more flexbile mounting would be nice. Expect some customization if the mounting sufaces aren't flat and uniform.Unfortunately, the device no longer automatically retracts after less than 1 year. Attempts to contact the manufacturer so far have been ignored. This device failed when it wasn't even in use. Don't expect high reliability."
2,I hate this gate!,"I bought two of these. Yes it is great in the fact that my 3 year old can't use it, and sneek out the front door. But the little ""switch"" to open and close it kills my fingers, and is difficult to use. I am getting better at it but the grandparents are cursing at it every time. I also hate that whenever I have a visitor, I have to stop what I am doing to let them in and out of it. But hey it does the job, and maybe I will master it."
2,nice. just not right,"was nice keyboard. just didnt fit my vaio that matched up to one of the listed model numbers. not even close as a matter of fact. however, seller was very quick to help return product with no hassle."
1,Don't waste your time,"This unit came incomplete. It was missing the adapter to use with the 3/8"" compressor line. Trying to figure out how to contact someone at Amazon about the problem was impossible. Finally gave up."
3,purchased as backup,I bought this as a backup to my Badger. The quality is what you would expect for the price.
2,Ok Air Brush,"First off the button leaks, the adapter for a propellent bottle does not fit the hose. The ends of the hose constantly fall out. I had to buy additional parts from the local hobby shop to get this thing working correctly. I found with in a few minutes I wished I had spent some extra money on a quality airbrush. Next month getting a compressor and a 3 airbrush set up. I paint guitars and this airbrush is not worth the 10 dollars I spent on it."
2,What is this?,"Ok, so I thought I would try to begin my airbrush skills with something small and cheap. Whoa, I was wrong. This is the most pathetic instrument I ever used. As an inexperience airbrusher, give me a McDonald's straw and I could do a better job with it. This is just sad. I rather spend a few more dollars on a beginners set."
4,Good for patterns and coating,"This airbrush was cheap but perfectly fine to use and higher quality than I expected for the price, though I haven't used any others so I can't compare well. The directions weren't too useful, but it was not difficult to put together at all, it comes with everything you need as long as you have a compressor and a normal-sized airhose, which the adaptor fits.I have been using it to paint different cloths for a costume, and it sprays well from a variety of distances, leaving an even coat, it is easy to heat-cure the paint with an iron. If you need to define smaller lines (down to about 1/4 inch) you can set the nozzle to be smaller and just get the brush closer to the material. It is not hard to hold or direct, and is not difficult to clean with airbrush cleaner liquid and a simple pipe cleaner. If you want absolutely perfect lines you can just use painter's tape to define the edges of whatever you're painting and then spray an even coat."
3,yeah...,its a best seller but i would suspect the air system into is poorly designed for usefullness. i dont like deluting too much the paints. its clogs at time and the bottles fall off the spray head. its a great toy but beside that its going to be a toy.
1,Piece of Junk!!!,"I bought one of these for using duracoat on firearms and it is the worst piece of equipment i have ever seen.The top leaks, no matter how tight you try to put the lid on. The valve broke on the brush. The tubes and such get clogged easily......i hate this thing."
1,"what's this, a joke?","So, I bought two of these things thinking it would be a decent deal. Sure, it MIGHT BE a decent deal but the reality is, this doesn't fit the compressor I have now and honestly finding an adapter has been a nightmare. Sure this comes with two adapters but...yeah, none of them fit. allegedly the ""air inlet"" is 1/4"" (I didn't see this anywhere on the description) and it appears that I have a 3/8"" compressor and hose for my compressor. This has just been a joke and the brushes have been sitting here taking up space rather than being useful."
2,Poor quality control,"Overall it's probably a case of you get what you pay for. But at this point I think I have almost as much epoxy on the ""regulator"" piece that you screw onto a can of propellant as there was plastic to begin with trying to plug up all the leaks, I've found at least 3 so far, but I think I'm running out of places so maybe it will end at 3. The airbrush itself is ok I guess, it's my first time trying to use one so I can't really say to much about that, it sprayed paint though."
1,Lost of time lost of money,"I buy a small compresor for this item, in the box said it work with a operation presure of 15-50 psi. my compresor have 28 PSI and never work. i buy a canned compressed air, but the nozzle does not work.better buy a real Airbrush dont lost you time and money"
1,Broken on arrival,"The actuator lever was broken off on arrival. Having an electronic background and needing this unit for an upcoming card game, I took it apart and installed a conventional on/off toggle switch in it to get it working again. It was an easy fix. The actuator arm is very flimsy and will not hold up. After my repair it is reliable and works quite well. Most people expect things to work right out of the box, silly people."
2,good practice problems but crappy examples,they do 10 different probelm types in one section and they dont explain how to do each probelm. this book helps a lil bit but over all it doesnt help very much. just hope that you have a good tutor or a teacher to help with precalculus.
2,A teacher's opinion,"I am not impressed by this textbook. My Trig students use selected chapters of this book and so far I have had the most difficulty with Chapter 4: Trigonometric Functions. The topics are misordered. For example, 4.2 introduces the idea of domain and period of sine and cosine, but students do not actually graph the functions until 4.5 (approximately one week later)! Students have to learn unit circle values beginning in 4.2, but the tricks for memorizing these values are withheld until 4.4. Another problem I've encountered is the example problems which sometimes skip steps that are not obvious. This is difficult for students to follow, especially when teachers encourage them to show all work. Overall, I would not recommend this text."
1,Horrible Book!,"My high school recently switched textbooks for all math classes, and as a student, I'm not glad that they did. This is probably the worst textbook I've ever had to use for a class. It gives examples of the simplest possible form of the topic. It doesn't go in depth at all, and is just generally difficult to understand. I'm incredibly glad that there have been a lot of teaching that hasn't been out of the book in my class this year, because if a class is entirely out of this textbook, students are destined to fail. If you're buying this for a college course, you should find a different class that doesn't use this text."
1,"Poor explanations, save your old Trig book","I can't begin to describe how poorly written the online homework is. Wrong answers, videos that conflict with the program answers and skip steps, formatting issues that mark you correct answer wrong, etc. The online Web Access homework should be described as online torture or an exercise to determine how much frustration you can stand.This book is poorly written and the explanations are vague. I strongly recommend you keep your old Trig text book to help you through this course."
1,Impossibly Annoying,"I found this book to be very infuriating and shallow, and there are many incorrect answers in the back. Many of the homework exercises are simply busy work, and I felt like I learned nothing by wasting my time doing them. The overall approach is too elementary in some areas that really need explaining, and too complicated in areas that could be simply stated. The authors should have proof-read!!! Don't get this book if you have a choice."
3,dont' read the last chapter,If you loved Jane from the first book you might want to skip this one because her fate will break your heart.On the other hand Sam Jr. will make you cheer.
1,Pure Horseshit,"I was very disappointed in this Album. I was under the impression that the hit ""Pickles And Retards"" was on this album, but was crushed to find that it wasn't seeing as that is a Withering Testicle song. www.witheringtesticle.tk"
1,Listen first,"First, I don't wish to insult Patricia Kaas fans' taste. I made the mistake of ordering this item to practice French based upon the reviews without having heard this artist -- very stupid. I dislike it so much that after hearing the first three songs I plan to give it away -- if I can find someone who wants it. My opinion: The background music is bad, the artist can't carry a tune, her voice grates like fingernails on a blackboard."
4,An offer you can't refuse!,"""The Godfather"" meets Carl Hiaasen in this darkly humorous meeting of the Mob and fishing - how's that for a combination! I'm not much of a fan of fishing, but I'm always ready to read another good satire of the mob, which Wiprud lands with deft skill.The plot has the seeming ease that reflects a well-honed craft. Sid Bifulco ratted out his Mafia family to the Feds, but the idea of entering the Witness Protection Program when he gets out of prison is about as attractive as a three-day-dead mackerel. Instead he decides to make his home along the Delaware river so that he can pursue his new-found passion of fishing. (Don't ask how a mobster decided to become a fisherman; the explanation is a good one and I don't want to give it away.)""Sleep with the Fishes"" is a good, quick, amusing read. Job well done for this new author.--David Montgomery, Mystery Ink"
4,Fast and funny,"I am an absolute sucker for books with quirky characters and this book is full of them (even the wildlife). You follow the adventures or rather misadventures of Sid (the retired gangster) and the local towns people. The pace is fast, the plot twists and turns and I found myself constantly trying to guess what was going to happen next..... only to turn the page and find out I was completely wrong. Its pleasing to know that the author has a sequal in the works so I'm very much looking forward to reading more about Sid and the gang."
5,Laugh out loud mob satire,"Brian Wiprud has written a laugh out loud mob satire, taking a cast of quirky characters, each with their own not-so-pure agenda, and weaving them into a story line about a retired mobster who just wants to go fishing. But it isn't quite that easy, as Sid discovers, and his first clue is the lady in red hikers..."
2,I've seen better math textbooks.,"I took a sampling course last year and I must say this text on its own is terrbily deficient. Few completed examples, no solutions at the back of the book, no solutions manual provided to the professor and a horribly vague and sometimes irrelevant exercise section gives any student using this text a difficult time to read/learn.I suggest sourcing out another before using this one. A bland reference at most."
2,Mediocre,"This book is not very student-friendly. Over-all, the book is an easy read and the examples in each section are helpful. However, the notation used by Lohr differs from the notation used by the statistical community (and professors) which makes applying her text to real life problems or other classes complicated. Also, the questions at the end of the chapters are asked in a vague manner. I am never sure what the questions are really asking. There is no answer key to the questions in the text, so your guess is as good as mine..."
3,Tough,"I thought it was OK... overall. The chocolate coating does at least taste--and melt--like chocolate, which for a protein/meal bar is not exactly something you can expect. The bar did last longer going down though: not only because it's bigger, but because it's so tough to chew! (A little too tough for me; the center could use a little moisture.) Maybe peanut just isn't my favorite in any bar--which seems to be the case; although this bar doesn't taste especially peanutty. Lastly, 10 calories short of 300 is really over the limit for me in the bar category."
2,not a good substitute,These were offered as a replace for Kashi Chocolate Peanut Rolls. They are not at all the same. They have more calories and less protein. Not a good substitute.
5,Very Good,"Tastes too good to actually be healthy. Sound too good to be true? I thought so, but it is really true. Nice job Kashi.If you have never eaten Kashi products, you are in for a treat. There are some I like better than others, but for food that is good for you, it is a pleasant surprise."
5,"Yummy, filling, satisfying","I tried one of these bars when I was on the run one day and was starving--and after that, I went back to order two 12-pack boxes. It's like a healthy version of a peanut butter cup--it's chewy, peanut-buttery, chocolatey, but the bonus is that they really fill you up unlike a candy bar, especially if you drink a big glass of water with it as there is a lot of fiber in this bar. And it doesn't make you feel shaky or headachey like a candy can, at least for me. I always keep one in my purse just in case I can't stop to eat during the day."
4,"drinking, driving & law enforcers","Withheld evidence, political agendas, & suppressed testimony that would have radically altered the investigation's conclusion about what had happened along that highway in Indiana, plus the witness who saw the crash & its aftermath, all add up to a valiant effort to chronicle the miscarriage of justice which, because of this one mother's perseverence, changed the laws.RETURN TO TYBEE is a difficult, alarming & profoundly rewarding read. Recommended by RebeccasReads for all parents responsible for teenagers, if for no other reason than to get a glimpse of the hell into which they will be cast when they let their children drink & get behind the wheel of a car, even when the crash is NOT their fault! In this case Justice was not only blinded, it was mugged before it got started."
4,A serious look at a funny man,"This book features an interesting interview, and then a rather rambling mononograph about Gorey's work overall. This essay is an important first attempt to place Gorey's unique vision into some kind of context, and though quite descriptive, it doesn't reveal a whole lot to me. The best part of the book is plates of some of Gorey's less well-known material, his stage curtain backdrops, etc. Fans of Gorey will appreciate a glimpse of these things for their collections. Those unfamiliar with his work would find a better introduction with one of the ""Amphigorey"" treasuries."
2,"Not bad, but the writing (Ugh!)","The author, Clifford Ross, knows his stuff. His inteview with Edward Gorey provides some illuminating insights into a great artist and charming soul. However, Ross's style often gives the impression that he is promoting his own material. Gorey's work is a pleasure to enjoy, and the book is worth a buy. (...)"
1,"Oh, Karen...","After all the work that Karen has done on Edward Gorey, it amazes me that she knows so little about him. This book was a huge disappointment to me, and most of it was a direct result of Karen Wilkin's romatic ramblings. It seems to me that she should go back and really read her other book, Ascending Peculiarty. That one is much better, more informative, and personal."
2,Not what I expected,This book has quite a bit of information for those wanting to show their Berner. I am not interested in showing and was quite disappointed. It does not talk a lot about simple pet training or other issues and has only black & white picture. I find the book quite boring and not too practical.
1,Boring as watching a hair grow,"This show was horrible. Seems to me Ford was being honored by people who really didn't like him. Then theres the tongue. He kept spitting it out like he was a frog. I recommend anything besides this show. I wish I had known and spent the money on fly paper. Seriously, BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD!!!"
1,Reversal of fortune,"So, how many of you noticed that the guitar is being held the wrong way? Really, if they can't get the cover photo printed correctly, what are the odds the rest of the album is produced well (aside from it being the greatest blues singer/guitarist ever, that is)."
3,OK,"It's not a bad movie, but it's more talk than action. I think 60% of the movie is shot in one room. The action should have been more exciting, but I guess that was not possible at the time the movie was shot. The charecters are not really well developed and the Germans are potrayed as pompous fools. From what I have read about the Bismarck and it's crew, that is so not true. But having said that it is a treat watching battleships cut through water so majestically!"
2,Bismark was skuttled,"According to Len Deighton's book ""Blood Tears and Folly"" the Bismark was skuttled by having it's seacocks opened. The battleship admirals would say that it was sunk by battleship gunfire. The Bismark was steaming in circles due to damage from aircraft launched torpedos. The lesson to be learned is that aircraft carriers seem to be the naval vessil that can inflict the most damage. Large battleships are vulnerable to attack from the air by aircraft and guided missiles. If there was a hero, it was the observer in the Catalina PBY that tracked the Bismark down and the pilot that hit the Bismark's rudder. The movie does not illustrate this."
4,"Entertaining, though a bit of a stereotype.","The movie accurately depicts Operation ""Exercise Rhine"", and the British reaction to it. Exciting, and very entertaining, though sterotyping the German Fleet Commander (Gunter Lutjens) as a fanatical nazi was very inaccurate, and to me, the most dissapointing aspect of an otherwise accurate account. Admiral Lutjens was a person who did not care for the Nazis or Adolf Hitler, but loved Germany and the Kriegsmarine. On the other hand, the depiction of the Bismarck's Captain (Ernst Lindemann) as a conscientous, dedicated career officer was very accurate.The models were well done and the combat scenes were also well portrayed. Well worth watching."
5,Sink the Bismarck,Very interesting history story. Explained a lot to me that was confusing about what had happened.
5,Preobably is one of the best or is the best WW2 movies.,"I did a class project on the Bismarck and we watched the movie and I could see the drama and suspense in their eyes. I also heard someone say ""What's next?"" I was kind of funny to see them shudder when the Hood was blown up and the Bismarck was. I highly recommend this movie to get a very real idea of how this ordeal was taken."
4,Surface Warfare,Excellent movie! Demonstrates the need for the behind the scenes men and women networking to get the most up-to-date intelligence on the enemy. The best warriors have the best back-up to support their efforts!!!
5,Pre WWII Thriller,"Excellent movie showing the British Navy in it's finest hour. Excellent portrayals of real people in crucial situations, showing their human sides as well as their Naval professionalism."
4,"The hunt for the Bismarck, what a week it was!","A stirring, action-packed war movie. Recent releases like 'The Triumph and the Glory' (the novel) and 'Memphis Belle' (not that recent, I guess, but you get my drift) display much of the traditional war story-telling style of this classic. If you like old-fashioned war dramas this one's for you."
4,Underrated Film,"Yes, it may not be Gone with the Wind, but it doesn't have to be. In fact this movie shows why Kenneth More had the talent to be one of the top actors of the day. Like many films it does take some liberties with history, for instance the film shows the German Admiral as a ""Proud Nazi"" when in reality he was anything but and hated the nazi party. Also the one time you'll hear the Prime Ministers voice you'll giggle at just how bad an impression it is of Churchill. But all in all it is a good movie and shows the contributions made to the British war effort by the people back in a single small plot room that never got the glory or recognition the other branches did."
3,Soundtrack,"For almost half the film the sound was like from the bottom of a swimming pool, but the video was so cheap it wasn't worth returning because of postage."
3,superior movie,this black and white movie is superb. i also have the book and it is a close match to it. everything is so well done that there is no room for critique. very realistic and you will not be disappointed.
5,Best naval movie ever!,By far the best naval battle movie ever produced. When I was in grade school I wrote a book report on the Bismark and have been interested in it ever since. The movie is not on television that much and all I can remember is seeing it once. I have been looking for it for over seven years now. I had found it on E-Bay but used copies were selling for over thirty dollars. I then found Amazon.com and was surprised to find a new tape for a lot less money. The time of shipping was excellent and I am very pleased with the movie. Why buy used when you can get new for a cheaper price. Keep up the good work Amazon.com.
5,nikki,this is a great movie. i have really enjoyed this dvd. it is a must see if you like war movies or documentaries.
3,cute but..,"It very cute and of good quality but it is one of those items that you don't use, perhaps until the baby is walking."
2,Too Overwhelming with Cinnamon,The oatmeal itself is great consistency--but there is just way too much cinnamon in it. It seems like they are trying to compensate for the lower sugar content with cinnamon. Yuck.
3,Love Kashi oatmeal,"I love the cereal - this flavor was exceptionally priced compared to other flavors. When I got the package, I realized why - they were expiring soon."
4,Not to sweet,Very tasteful and not too sweet. This really seems to be a quality and healthy oatmeal. I eat it every morning
4,It's Oatmeal,"It's oatmeal. And it's not half bad. There are dried cubes of apple in each packet, which are tasty, but are few and far between. This oatmeal is great with a little added fruit, I especially enjoy adding chopped bananas. The sweetness of the oatmeal goes great with a black coffee or strong tea. The preparation is quick and convenient; I find myself eating breakfast more often because of it. All you need is boiling water and a few minutes, no extra microwaving required (as is the case with some other instant oatmeals). If you don't like oatmeal to begin with, you probably don't want to go all-in with a month's supply. But if you have the chance to sample it, try it out, it might change your mind."
1,cardboard meets apple spice,"I really love their other products but this one just isn't a winner. I tried every combination possible (microwave, hot water, hot milk) hoping that the favor would change, especially since I bought 8 boxes of the stuff. But no luck! I can't seeing throwing the stuff away so I will donate it and hope that it bring someone else's taste buds alive."
5,Wonderful screen adaptation of the Chekov play,"Two points to make:First, this adaptation of the play for the screen is absolutely first rate. Some scenes were added at the beginning to help the viewer understand the subsequent action. The rest of this movie was mostly faithful to the Chekov text, although the director took full advantage of not being bound to a stage. The end result is mesmerizing. I really felt as if I were at close hand, watching the characters trying to make sense of their lives and losses. Yes, the action is slow moving, but in the best possible sense.Second, I have rarely seen a movie where action and soundtrack merged as flawlessly as in ""The Cherry Orchard"". The incidental music is Tchaikovsky's ""Meditation"" and ""The Seasons"" and is played by Vladimir Ashkenazy. One word: superb.This is a movie that rewards repeated viewing."
4,The Cherry Orchard,"The main reason I like this movie it is one of Gerard Butlers early movies. I thought it was good. I was very impressed by Gerard Butler, but I am always impressed by him."
1,"This is NOT the play, NOT even close.","If you don't care about what you watch go ahead and rent this, but it isn't the play. As a movie I can't say."
4,Awesome Movie,"I bought this movie just because Gerard Butler is in the cast but I must say that the whole story is great! It's a different type of movie and it's based in an old bookclassic, which makes it even better. The cast is great, besides the hunky Gerard Butler. Worth seeing."
2,Uttery depressing,"I will first admit I watched this movie for Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera, Dracula 2000). But of course watched the whole movie. The characters are all insane! The mother never seems to really understand that she's goin to lose everything because of her previous foolishness with money until the house is bought by her older daughter's suiter, who plans to tear the whole place down. The uncle tries to be helpful, but even he's clueless until it's too late. Even Gerard's character is cruel. And the ending is utterly sad because it shows how thoughtless they all are. I will leave out why, because I want the watcher to see what I mean. This is truely a sad and depressing movie."
2,Hard to Like,"If Woody Allen were to do another satire of Russian Lit (viz a viz Love and Death), he could do no better than to fashion it after this abysmal offering. I love Chekhov. I don't claim to have known him personally, but trust me, this is no Chekhov. I have no clue what the director was after: Comedy? Farce? Melodrama? Soap Opera? Well, he has followed several of those threads, but actual Chekhov? Nay, nay, I say.To have assembled such a promising cast and to get such risible performances out of them must surely be some sort of achievemant in it's own right. I don't believe they give Oscars out for that, but they do give Harvard Lampoon Awards.BEK"
4,A compelling read that sets you in another era....,"I was drawn quickly into the story of Amy and her sister Effie, and found myself on the train, at the doctor's office, and up late at night, racing through it to see what would happen. The story is beautifully written, and Stover has crafted lyrical passages that will impress those who yearn for the literary along with a good yarn. Stover has done a wonderful job capturing another era and culture so that you feel yourself transported as well. I hope to read more of Stover's work in the future, for a first-time novelist, her efforts are well worth your time."
5,"Read to Me, Mama","Mama is a wonderful storyteller. You know the type- she paintsvivid word pictures, setting off each line with a gesture, a body orhand motion, a snatch of song. But Mama has a secret...How would you feel if you couldn't read?Mama has never told her small son her humiliating secret, but now he's learning to read and she won't be able to hide it much longer. What will Mama do? Told from a child's standpoint, this touching and delightful story for children will appeal to anyone who reads- or loves his mama."
1,Mission Batangas,"The movie ""Mission Batanga"" is a great movie; however, the soundtrack of this video was unintelligable, loud static. Too bad."
3,"produces great water, but one problem...","the water no doubt is 'spotless' and free of water spot producing contaminants... the problem here is that the wet resin gets contaminated by algae or some other process between uses. So you have to empty out each blue water tank after each use completely and even then the resin gets contaminated, only slower. This unit is ideal if you are constantly using it... then you'll get max gallons of water between resin refills... but if you are a weekend washer that uses it about once a month, then you'll get way fewer gallons out of it between resin refills."
2,kinda spicy,"wasnt overwelmed with like for this....its kinda spicy and way harder than i expected, wont order again, im glad my teeth are in good condition"
2,You get what you pay for...,I bought this item to find nails not immediately visible to the naked eye in lumber as I am a wood worker. It would find a nail that was brand new however it would not pick up a rusted nail while laying on it. If you need something that's going to be accurate this product is not it.
3,worked,"Came unassembled, not easy to put together. worked good enough for Halloween costume. Had 2 guys be Homeland security at our front door for the party."
5,We love these dishes!,"I have dozens of cookbooks but this is the one cookbook I have found that has consistently excellent, tasty recipes. As a busy mother of three boys I don't have time for complicated recipes with long lists of ingredients which take hours to make and then somehow... just don't work. These recipes are a snap to put together, so flavorful and a hit every time. Most important, they're healthy and nutritious for both adults and growing children. My family and friends are amazed at my new confidence and skill in the kitchen. I owe it all to this book. I asked my six year old son Skylar, what he thought of Mom's new cooking and here is his unedited reply: ""I love the food that my Mom makes now. She makes the best food of all time."" I think that says it all. This book is a winner!"
2,Even Ninja Lovers Won't Like This Made-For-TV Scrap Heap,"Master Ninja is nothing but two episodes of the TV series ""The Master"" repackaged and poorly edited into one movie. If that weren't shameful enough, the actual episodes selected for the movie are downright laughable. When we see Lee Van Cleef riding on top of a crook's car, he reaches through the broken windshield and actually pulls the steering wheel off while the criminal is still driving. One of the silliest things I've ever seen, by far. No guest star in the world could save this flop of a tape, and don't expect to see too much of Demi Moore by the way."
3,Cheesy Chop-socky madness,A sneering Lee Van Cleef.Punchy Bill Conti theme music....What's not to like?
5,A great book of tips for a beginner going on to advanced,"The best part about this book is the part about CSS. (cascading style sheets) Since this is a pretty new concept as compared to HTML, there are hardly any books on it. Also, instead of clumpy lengthy explainations, the book provides quick reference to what you need. Though the part about DHTML and java was a bit of a letdown, it is good book if you wish for little tips on enhancing your page"
5,"Best comprehensive ""single source"" nutritional healing reference","I have been using this book, among many others, since its publication. What I find is that with almost every subject, this book provides clear answers that are reinforced across the entire body of nutrition research literature. I have come to trust this reference as a ""single source"" as a result, even though in the beginning I would consult several sources. Mr. van Straten is the #1 health journalist in the UK and has run a private practice for nutritional healing for 30 years. His advice is practical and very usable. The book is also beautifully illustrated, making it a pleasure to use."
2,beastly master,very disappointed to receive dvd's that have the country code for the USA even though you knew that they were to be shipped to Spain. I think that is a disgrace. Now I can only watch them on my pc and that is not the same. last time i bought on Amazon. USA wants to interfere all over the world but then they have to be sepecial in all things. YUK
4,mah jongg set,"This set has a nice looking case that is roomy enough to accommodate pushers and seems sturdy. It's also somewhat waterproof since FedEd delivered mine to the wrong address and the box sat out in the rain with no damage to the contents of the case. One of the clasps sticks a bit, however.I was also pleased with the set itself --lovely ivory tiles and four colored racks. However, when I was taking the new racks out of their plastic bags, one slipped and fell about ONE INCH to the table, and a corner shattered off. In other words, I'm disappointed with the durability of the racks"
4,Maj Jong set,"The set came exactly as described. Mahjong is a great game played with tiles which engages the players and distracts attention from worldly problems. We play for 3 hours at a time, and I play two times a week."
3,the second set,"this is the second set that I got, since the first one had damaged tiles. this set also had some tiles that were marked, but we were able to remove most of them. in addition, one of the case locks sticks when you try to close it. I would not recommend this set"
4,Western Mah Jong set,"Very good product, sturdy and nice size tiles. The print is clear. Nice case, very portable.I would recommend this product."
1,Dissapointed With Product,"Item arrived in bad shape tape was not visible for play, contacted vendor who promised refund but never saw refund or heard anything back from amazon. VERY DISAPPOINTED"
4,excellent book,great book. A must have for any parent regardless of whether they want to enroll their child in a suzuki program or not. I found it really helpful in everyday skills needed to help my children.
2,Side Effects,I thought it was a very low rated cheesy movie. One of Heigl's lower end products that she made and was very disappointed in it. The lips didn't even match with the sound so I felt like I was watching an old godzilla movie. It was horrible.
3,Side Effects - true but done cheaply,The subject matter is pretty accurate but the film was done with very cheap production values. Its resembles the effort and expense of a directoral student production. You can almost see the microphone hanging over the actors. Watch it if you aren't expecting much more than you could produce yourself with some professional actors and your own home video equipment.
2,Side Effects DVD,"This has to be the worst movie I have watched in a very long time.Katherine Heigl is a great actress but, this was a really bad script for her. Do Not Buy............"
1,Not a good movie,"This movie is terrible. the acting is HORRENDOUS! Catherine Hiegl is good however every other cast member is awful. It is just anti-pharmaceutical propoganda and lies. i highly recommnd against buying this film. Although the pharma industry does have a lot of money, the film equates being a pharmaceutical rep with selling your soul to the devil. Every day a new medicine saves a life, despite what this movie will have you believe. Ridiculous and a waste of money. I wish i could get the hour and a half of my life back..."
2,Anti drug industry film,This film was clearly making a statement about the drug industry and was so one sided in its presentation. I get tired of all of the Hollywood leftwing crap!
1,total ripoff,We expected a romantic comedy and instead we were preached to about the corruption in the business of selling meds. Not what we expected from Katherine Heigl and not well represented by Amazon. I would like my money back.
3,DVD was good,ordered this for a friend as a gift as she is a huge fan of Heigl and she was very happy with her gift
3,side effects,"it is about a lot of teenagers partying all the time,having romances with every one the meet. but one girl is looking for the real deal of finding some one who will fall in love with."
4,Eye Opening Movie,"This movie was very impressive, being the budget that the filmmaker was on. Kathreine Heigl made the movie fun to watch. I knew nothing about the pharmaceutical industy, and this movie got me interested and aware of what goes on."
5,A 'fun' expose of the sales tactics of the pharmaceutical industry,"Before I saw this movie I had never given much thought to the pharmaceutical industry. I got my prescriptions filled at Walgreens and took them dutifully, without any consideration as to how that presciption ended up in my hands.'Side Effects' is eye-opening without being the least bit didactic as it follows new-grad Karly Hert's career trajectory as a pharmacutical rep. She masters the tactics her employers encourage her to use to peddle her wares to doctors, enjoying increasing financial success even as she questions the ethical implications of her work.With a feel-good ending that I won't spoil, 'Side Effects' succeeds as both a post-college coming-of-age story and an investigation of the sales tactics of the pharmaceutical industry. Katherine Heigl is fantastic as the wide-eyed and increasingly jaded Karly, and don't miss Dorian DeMichele as Karly's unscrupulous boss. A must see."
2,Cheaply made movie,"I bought this Movie because Kathreen being in it, but was diaappointed I under stand what they were trying to get across but if I were her I'd stick to Greys Atomony series"
1,Defective Packaging from Manufacturer,"I recieved the shipment on time. Couldn't try the product as it came in hard as a rock. This is supposed to be in ""powder' form. It seems that this lot had a problem in packaging at the manufacturer because I replaced another one from Amazon and that too came like that. Again, this product may be good but I haven't had a chance to try it. Hopefully this helps others who are trying to order this."
1,Don't be fooled by this scheme!,"Anxiously waiting for a great Universal supplement, I was disapointed when I received a crappy bottle of hormones from USP Labs... This damned store fooled me."
1,Only fits specific Ford F-150s,"When I researched for what rear mat to get for my Ford f150, this Part number 450052 was one of the results from my search. This is a warning to all that this rear Mat will only fit 2004 to 2008 Ford F150 SUPERCREWS and 2006 to 2008 Lincoln Mark LT. THAT IS IT! The description does not say anything about that. I did not know this info until I received the product and noticed that was noted on the box. Amazon says it will fit my f 150 and It does not fit my 2006 extended cab. I am waiting on the seller to see if they will refund my purchase, will let you know how that goes."
4,okay,The CD is fine but there was a tear on the front cover of the insert that wasn't mentioned. Overall good sale/service. Thanks.
1,No attention to detail,"This book had so many errors, the entire class including the instructor were confused. It is very sad to see a textbook in its fifth or sixth edition with so many mistakes. Many of the questions at the end of the chapter are so poorly written, that there was no solution. Clearly, the authors had a goal and a message to convey, but because there was no attention to detail, the message was muddy at best. I remain disenchanted with the general quality of textbooks, but this is one of the worst examples of a textbook I have ever seen. Come on America, educate!"
4,Construction equipment and methods,The text book is an excellent resource for my upcoming professional engineer's exam. I would recommend this text book for potential professional engineers getting ready to take the professional engineer's exam
1,Don't Pass me this DVD...,"I banked on this documentary being something I could use for a research project. I sent for it and got it just in time to do the project only to find out there's NOTHING OF EDUCATIONAL VALUE IN HERE. There are no concrete facts, and nothing with historical basis.You can't make a DVD pretending to be about Hip Hop when all it is is hip hop artists telling their tale of success, (what success? I've never heard of you!)Don't let the gimicky promotional stuff fool you, if you're genuinely interested in the progression and roots of latino hip hop, you can't find it here."
1,I smell a RAT,"This was definitely not the best Doc on Latin Hip-Hop I have ever seen. Has the filmmaker ever made a movie before? Not very high on style, extremely low on pertinent info and just plain poorly assembled. I am dumber for having seen it...."
5,really worked,"We all know women who are young have long lashes & this stuff definitely made mine grow! I think those who it didn't work for possibly weren't touching the base of the lash with the product. Lashes themselves are dead hair & so it can't be stimulated to grow, but the hair follicle under the skin is what needs the product. I don't bother actually putting it on the lash at all! I only know this because this must be similar to what they give people with cataracts. The patient puts ointment into the eye, but their eyelashes grow like mad! Makes sense to me! ;o)"
1,It does not work at all,"I am totally desapointed in your product, to help even more I've been using the eye-lite waterproof mascara, and not only don't I seee any results but my lashes seem shorter than they used to be.I want a refund !"
4,Husband gives it a thumbs up!,"My husband, a Howard Stern fan, has been looking for these DVDs since the show went off the air. It was one of the best holiday gifts he could have received. The humor and content are right on the mark for all Howard Stern fans!"
4,LLLOOOOWWWW but so good...,"this is no high end brain show.. infact, there is no brain at all... but sometimes this is what the DR ordered!"
4,Son of the Beach - Where's Volume 2 ?,"I have no review at this time, as I can't add anything that hasn't already been said. I would just like to know if anyone has heard if there are plans to release volume two, so fans of the show can complete the collection. I've read sales of volume one were low, but maybe a limited edition release of volume two could be considered."
5,unexpected amazement,"I bought this a couple days ago just to get free shipping with my Futurama season 1. I don't even ever remember hearing about this coming out on tv. when I got it, I popped in disc 1 and watched it all the way through with my girlfriend. we literally couldnt stop laughing. I love it so much more than the futurama. It lasts for 21 episodes (futurama had a little more than half that)!but back to son of the beach, I think it's more of a comedy for the immature crowd that loves watching overly corny, random sex jokes that are so corny, they're totally funny. oh, and the crowd that likes girls in lingerie and notch johnson with his shirt off. If youre an angry feminist, just look the other way, but if you like beer and holdem I'd definitely recommend it"
4,The problem with letters...,"This is the sort of book you could finish in one sitting. While it fills time between Murakami books, I find both strength and weakness in its form (a story told through a series of letters exchanged by former spouses who have been apart for 10 years). The problem with writing a book in the form of letters is: 1. the author's need to maintain proper writing (grammar, punctuation etc.) at the expense of the character's natural writing style (are they both such perfect writers? we'll never know); and 2. the hard-to-ignore fact (perhaps just in this case) that the letters are indeed written by the same person (the author). If you can get past these conflicts (at least to me) then the book is quite enjoyable."
2,Only Okay,I have heard every CD that Hezekiah Walker has put out and this one comes in last as one my favorites. All of his cd's were great but when I listened to this one I was dissapointed. I am an avid gospel music listener as that the only type of music I listen to. It's not a bad cd but it's nothing to rant and rave about and it falls short in comparison to his prior cd's.
4,I think I'll like it more in the future,"When I first got it, I felt let down. Maybe I was too excited.""Lift Him Up"", ""Hold Out"", and ""Celebrate"" are great songs. I would give the CD 3 stars but I am confident I'll grow to like this CD more. That's usually how it happens with Hezekiah Walker CD's, I think.This CD is not as good as Live in New York or Hooked on the Hits (which also took me a while to like)."
2,Ummmm.......,"I have every Hezekiah Walker release -- from the first label, Sweet Rain Records to Benson to Verity, his current label. Hez and his aggregation have shown stability, but this new project, ""20/85 The Experience"", doesn't show versatility. This is his first release in about 3 years and quite frankly, I was hoping to hear Hez & LFC stretch more. Though I did enjoy ""Do You Know Jesus"", ""It's More than that,"" ""No Defeat"" and ""Grateful"", I truly feel that as talented and as capable as Hez and his team is, it is now time that he refine and reinvent their sound."
5,Inspiring!,I love this CD! This is my second one as my first wore out from the play! Definitely worth replacing! Very positive uplifting CD!
4,Appreciate this project more!,"I am a big fan of Hezekiah Walker. Everytime he comes out with an album, I get it. However, I was somewhat disappointed with it at first. Then I kept playing ""Lift Him Up"" and ""Faithful is Our God"". I played the latter even more and was more blessed by it. Then I started getting into other songs and enjoy it more. Definitely should be a part of gospel fans' collections."
2,Great while it lasts,"I have owned 3 of these units. None lasted more than 6 months. I am not a very demanding owner, asking only that the machine grind spices and coffee beans. The performance is excellent, the design is nice, but after 3-6 months the motor seizes up. At first I thought it was corrosion from wiping it out with a damp rag, so on the subsequent 2 units I used dry paper towels only. (That didn't help.) For the price, it's a good little unit, as long as you don't mind frequent replacement."
3,What a noisy grinder!,"This grinder works just fine, but what a racket! It's extremely noisy. I wish I'd been a more careful shopper, and am thinking about replacing this one.It's also pretty hard to clean, but I suppose most grinders have this problem."
5,The best season of the first five,"4.6 starsA few weeks ago I got every season of this show from my local libraries and watched them in order during a very funny week. Without a doubt I enjoyed season three the most, mainly due to Piven's great story line, and Dillon's constant wry hilarity. This is also the season where Ari's assistant Lloyd comes into his own, and he does it very humorously. The writing is strong throughout, the cast thoroughly tight with their comic timing, and in general I laughed my as off frequently.While not the funniest tv show ever, it's certainly one of the best of the last decade, and this is one season I'll gladly rewatch in the years to come when I need some good humor."
5,The Boys Still Rock,"Ignore the Part 1 description in the title, this is the whole season, and what a season it was, and is!! Great story lines, and the characters (at least some) develop nicely. Thankfully, it is the secondary characters. E and Vince are getting a little stale, but Drama and Ari really come alive. In both cases it is better material, but let's face it, these guys can act. Jeremy Piven is a virtuoso; Kevin Dillon is in no danger of being mistaken for a member of a Shakespearean troupe, or even his older brother, Matt. But as the neurotic, short-tempered Johnny Chase he absolutely rocks.This is now the best show on TV."
5,The best HBO show there is....,"Hillarious! The never ending story of Vincent Chase and his buddys Eric ""E"",Johnny Drama,Turtle and of course Ari continues.This HBO show never gets boring.Too bad the producers split the third season in two parts...."
1,Why is this not called entire season 3?,"I cannot for the life of me understand why HBO has decided to call episodes that air 10 months apart the same season. In this regard and this regard only network tv is much better.Not only have they decided to call episodes that air after a 10 month hiatus the same season, but they've also decided to sell the season in 2 parts. In what universe does this make sense? First off HBO is notorious for ripping off customers with insanely high dvd set prices, now they've decided to split one season into 2 ridiculous prices. Entourage is easily my favorite television program. I think Ari Gold and Johnny Drama are the freshist and funniest characters on tv in more than a decade. It's just a shame that HBO has such a lack of respect for fans of their programs. Unless at some point down the road the 2 sets are combined for a reasonable price I'm boycotting all future Entourage dvd's and so are quite a few people I know in an online community too."
1,Missing Disc,You sent me another disc from a whole different series in season 3 part 1. Everything else was good but not having the beginning of the season really sucks
2,sad,I could not see paying more shipping then I paid for the popcorn!!!!! :(Will never buy anything more from this company!
5,Wonderful All Terrain Stroller,"After an extensive stroller search, we settled on this stroller, and it's great!! It's one of the lightest strollers in it's category and it has the most head room growth for our daughter. The others (ie: Bob and InStep) have limited head room growth. Some of the strollers our daughter's head was already above the seat back (Jeep and BabyTrend). This stroller can be easily steered with one hand for shopping or other tight quarters and performs great outside with the wheel locked on long walks. I haven't tested it for jogging yet. Also, it easily fits in my trunks (a Ford contour and a Saturn LS2). My diaper bag does not fit in the storage basket, but it hangs on the back just fine. There is a storage bin under the seat, a mesh bag on the back of the seat, and a small zipper section under the handle on the back. Overall, well worth every penny...I only wish I had bought it two years ago! A great investment!"
3,Limited sunshade + uncomfortable seat,"I was determined to only have ONE stroller when I was shopping during my pregnancy. I decided on the City Series because of the smaller wheel base (than the BOB Rev) and the easy folding mechanism. What I hadn't considered, was true comfort. Which I'm sure a lot of 1st time moms might miss.My daughter hates the sun in her eyes, and the seat (with its cumbersome adjustable straps) has no back support. Sometimes it looks like she's in a hammock, unless I lay her back a bit, which she typically disputes that idea because she wants to see everything.The stroller has been extremely duarble for the last year+ and I do love it... during certain times of the day (sun) and when she actually settles into it.+ if you have hills, you'll want a brake, which the BOB has...something else I over looked."
2,No 7.1/5.1 Sound Through S/PDIF,"This is indubitably a nice sound card, but does not offer much of an improvement vis-a-vis on-board sound of a decent quality. The installation on Win7 is 'complex' (to use a more acceptable synonim for 'nightmare') and Diamond's tech support is pure manure (both online and via telephone). Most importantly: if you are buying this card to listen to your music files in simulated 7.1/5.1 by connecting it via the optical (S/PDIF) out to your receiver - STOP! The optical only offers 2.1 out. The documentation sheets are misleading, and tech support is less than knowledgable (to say the least...)"
1,Worked well for about 20 hours,"Satisfactory card for converting classical LPs to CDs. The software interfaces are easy to use, and the resulting audio files produced using Audacity and burned on to CDs sounded fine, and had acceptably low levels of electronic noise. Sorry the card died."
3,"its ok, windows 7 support took too long","it wouldn't work for several months so didn't even bother with it. there was no support at all for windows 7 x64 on it's install disk or online. they finally created a driver in the end of may, and it installed fine. the sound quality is pretty good. it is a little prone to picking up noise, but for it's price is understandable."
1,Digital Output Does Not Work,"The SPDIF (digital optical output) doesn't work, there is no output. I am an engineer and understand the software and the card. I have gone through every single check box and turned it off and on. No result. I have changed inputs on my Pioneer VSX-1019AH-K receiver, no results (they work with my other Optical Out equipment). Nothing I have tried works. All the analog outputs on the card do work. I have contacted Diamond's support desk and got one response asking me if I have gone into the control panel for the sound card to turn on the SPDIF? Of course the answer was yes, no response after that. I have seen on the forums lots of people are having the same problem as I am with the optical digital. Someone at Diamond must have a solution to this problem?Anyone else have this problem?"
1,Beware if you have Blu-ray,"I purchased this card to use with an internal Blue-ray player, and found it would not output DTS digital 5.1 or 7.1 from the optical SPDIF port (stereo worked OK). When I called technical suppoort they told me that the card did not support either DTS (contrary to claim on box), or Blu-ray. The box indicated that the card would support DVD multi channel playback in either DTS or Dolby digital."
1,Not worth it.,"No shielding whatsoever. Picks up all electromagnetic interference from motherboard; constantly buzzes, clicks and whines whenever mouse is moved, disks are accessed, or graphics card has heavy load. Completely useless for surround sound."
1,Optical in doesn't work.....,"The whole reason I bought this was to hook up the blu-ray player to the computer speakers. Optical in doesn't work, and I've gotten no reply from the manufacturer. I'd do a 0 for 5 stars if I could...."
4,Cant beat $16,"Install was a breeze, just had to download the drivers from the website for vista. The software that is downloaded comes with a bunch of sound options to choose from to meet your taste. It will take you half a day just listening to them all, lol. You can even create your own custom sound choice. Sounds great with TV and movies, and for $16 after rebates I wont complain about anything. It is definately a big improvement over the onboard sound."
1,Does not work with windows 7 64 bit,Service and support is poor at Diamond. The software CD would not install as windows 7 rejected it. I finally called support and they gave me a file that was suppose to correct the problem - which it did not. I tried manually to install it and it just would not work. I asked for a updated CD and no reply. Obviously this is dead end card in their product line.I brought my pc to a local computer shop and they could not get it updated properly either.I only bought the card because I thought I fried my motherboard audio system but it turned out to be just a driver update so I have sound now.I would not recommend this company to anyone who has windows 7 in their system. You can't relay on having your emails (you have to submit a ticket) to get support. I still have one open for over a month. If I ever have to buy a sound card I will be buying creative next time.
1,false data,i had to take my tower to the shop to make it work the soft ware was not geared for my system my system is vista your sortware was for xp 2000
2,Not 64-bit compatible,"I'm sure this is a fine sound card, but it says nowhere in the description nor on the box that it is not compatible with 64-bit Windows. So, in these modern times where most computers are 64-bit, this sound card is useless."
3,jewelery cleaner,"A bit noisy when turned on, but it does the job and leaves your gemstones sparkling clean."
1,Item arrived dirty!,"My jewelry cleaner arrived with dark streaks all around the sides from the cardboard box it came in. It looked like there was newpaper ink inside the box. I couldn't get it to come off, so mine looks pretty nasty. The unit itself seems very cheaply made and it is very noisy when running. My jewelry was only slightly cleaner after using it. I would have returned it, but the shipping would be almost as much as it cost. I will probably throw it away instead."
2,"Busy work, misses the mark, smattering of info","Philosophy of education is important when choosing curriculum. I am in the Charlotte Mason camp when it comes to what my children read. Therefore, I do not like this curricula. However, I do not regret purchasing it because it made me aware of why I am disappointed by some of my curricula choices. Up until now, I did not realize that this type of curricula contains exactly the twaddle Charlotte Mason wrote about in her widely embraced Education series. I have switched to Spelling Power and so far I am very satisfied with what the material is teaching my child and also very important, how it is teaching my child. No review for SP yet because we have done just one daily practice session. I am not against workbooks; I use workbooks for math. I don't expect literature quality sentences for math story problems, the math book itself -for lack of better word- is not dumbed down. So two stars for ""A Reason..."""
2,Not much Wolf,"Howlin' Wolf sings only FOUR songs on this album. The other songs are instrumentals or are sung by other bandmembers, including Detroit Junior and Eddie Shaw. Those guys are good, and I have their records, too, but I wanted Wolf here. I gave it the second star for the pictures. Recorded in Cambridge, Mass."
2,Space 1999 meets Dr. Who,"And I mean the old cheesy Dr. Who, not the wonderful new verson on BBC.At least I got to see Barry Morse and Jack Palance, and that's why I gave this mess two stars instead of one. By all means watch it before you plunk down real money and let it take up space permanently on your shelf."
2,not a popcorn grind,"The product wasn't what I had expected. The granule size is consistent for salted nuts. However, it is courser grain than I am accustom to for popcorn. I wouldn't call this popcorn salt. I prefer Morton popcorn salt."
5,A pinch for luck......,"This is a great product. It's texture makes it perfect for other things besides popcorn. With salt in so many products, I don't worry about the lack of iodine in this salt. After all, it's not like you eat it everyday. In fact, it sticks so well you can actually use less. Good product."
5,great popcorn salt,I was always hunting for popcorn salt in markets and only occasionally finding it....this is just what I wanted and in a large enough size to be economical and last for a while
3,No Popcorn,I thought that I was sendind my daughter in NC Popcorn...but it was only SALT...they are having a problem popping just normal corn in the popper. Why???
3,Sublime Beauty,"Ladies, this is a must see, if only to peer at the resplendent beauty of Geronimo. Spend an hour and a half gazing into the piercing blue eyes of Chuck Connors. The story plays fast and loose with historical facts, but who cares! After seeing that face, you will hardly remember the story-line anyway.Some of Chuck's old buddies from ""The Rifleman"" appear. His leading lady, and second wife, Kamala Devi, lends a demure balance to the fierce, and grumpy Geronimo.You will watch it over and over again, just to see the magnificent bone structure, and animal magnetism of Geronimo.Whew!"
3,"Great idea, truly, but how to implement it?","I liked the insight this book shared, but left wondering what I was supposed to do with this new outlook, ideas on how to approach situations differently. I got tired of reading about all the personal success the author reported in raising his kids. I don't need a book for that.Like the approach but it ought to be fleshed out more with some less personal scenarios. Parenting is truly so personal."
5,Grace is in Place,"I believe this is the most insightful book of its type I have read and really poses questions and provides answers for parents and married couples that would not only improve all relationships, but more importantly it sets the basis for individual self confidence, happiness and satisfaction by substituting a win-win approach for the normal win-lose situation we find in families and society today. As a Christian, I found the book held the key to really building strong happy people and families. Unfortunately I followed the wrong formula when I was raising my family. I can't do as good a job now with my family but it's never too late to start to make things better. That's what the book is about."
5,Such an inspiring book,"As a mother of two very young children, this book was recommended to me as I began my research on grace based discipline. I was excited to find it addresses not only the parent-child relationship but the husband-wife relationship as well. I learned so much from this book. I couldn't put it down. I definitely think that it should be read more than once, as it has some heavier parts and it can't all be truly digested in one read. Highly recommended!"
1,Don't give this to an inside dog,"I strongly recommend NOT giving this to an inside dog. My best guess is that it has a high level of salt or something that made my dog incredibly thirsty and caused him to drink huge quantities of water. We gave it to him for about 5 days - the second day, he had an accident in the house. Thought it was a fluke, but that night, he woke us up whining to go outside where his water is - drank the whole bowl, and then peed for what seemed like 2 minutes. Then I found another puddle by the family room door. He'd gone during the night, then again around 5:00 and then went again when we let him out for breakfast around 7:00. This happened three nights in a row before we switched him back to his old food. 3 days back on the old food and no more restlessness during the night and no more accidents. This isn't a fluke - it was the food that caused this. Just be careful."
2,Using Photoshop with the D200,"More about Photoshop and picture finishing than about the D200. The D200 info could be obtained from info on camera review sites on the web or instruction manual. Great for someone who knows absolutely nothing about Photoshop, and yes, nothing about the Nikon D200, but you could actually plug in the specs about any camera and have a new ebook. No in depth knowledge or ""secrets"" or special techniques not obtainable from a good general photography book about picture development - after the shot is made. D200 info was an afterthought in this publication...look around and save your money for D200 info."
3,Not for Petites!,"I recall a petite woman reporting that the collar was for GIANT people...no eggageration! I sooo wish I took that review seriously.I NEVER write these things...but to all you petite gals out there...here is the low down:Arm length was fine...but LONG in body....and COLLAR HUGE!May be ok if you are normal sized...but besides the petite concerns...it really is NOT that soft...zipper sort of caught from start...so quality really is questionableFor you petites...I am 5'2"" 115 lbs and the PS Looks like I am wearing a collar with a coat attached!"
3,Beautiful jacket but not sized well for petites,"The jacket was actually very nice but the proportions used for petite sizing are really off. The Petite Small was much too large in the shoulders and body. The collar was huge - it came up almost to my jaw. Regretfully, I had to send it back."
5,great jacket,"I received the coat and it is supple leather and lightweight, feels wonderful and is just what I need. I did size up but am returning it for a smaller size, it was just too big. Will return to Luxury Lane again for sure."
1,Do not buy,I have had this jacket less than a year and it has 3 tears in it . I wore it back and forth to work doing nothing more dangerous than getting in and out of the car. Do you have any clothes that rip that easily? Pretty to look at if you don' t plan on leaving the couch.
4,Nice Leather Jacket Great Deal,"This is my first leather jacket and I trusted Amazon for my first purchase. I received a notice from Amazon that the item had a small damage but I could still purchase the jacket at a considerable discount (and still had the option to return if I did not like it). Well, I absolutely love the jacket and the so called ""damaged"" is hardly noticeable."
4,superb!,"I chose this book for a 10-15 page book report, and boy am I glad I did. It was interesting, effective, and written in a very accesible manner. It really personified Louis for me, he's a really cool guy.oh and p.s., I'm fifteen, so I commend Olivier Bernier on making a 348 page book on an old dead french king come alive and be of interest to a 15 year old girl. bravo!"
1,One Disappointing Reference Book,"I bought this book hoping to gain a solid understandingof the potential legal ""bullets"" (contract disputes, copy-right issues, etc.) that an Internet entrepreneur should beon the lookout to avoid...What I got instead was a 250-page essay on the historyof the (Canadian) legal system and the field of computerscience...Clearly intended as a college textbook, this book isprofoundly misleading in its subtitle, ""What You Needto Know About Doing Business Online.""I would avoid it."
1,This is so outdated,"It's scary. No fault of the writer's, because it made sense *3* years ago, but that would be like trying to sell a book in 1997 that is entitled ""What Fax Machines Can Do For Your Business"" or a 1948 book on ""Why Your Company Needs Telephones"". Doesn't anyone have anything new?"
5,totally enjoyable,We actually had this one when my children were young. My daughters learned and performed cheers from this video. Thanks
3,Let's Play Ball!,"My son Dylan, 4, is a sports nut! He loves Kidsongs videos, so I knew this would be perfect for him! I wish it had more of the tv station part in it, but still a great video."
2,a little sexist,"My toddler loves all these old kidsongs videos. This is my least favorite, because of the little girls in halter tops supposedly getting excited about the boy driving the race car. She's also not that interested in sports. All the other videos are dated, but good."
3,"Frankly, overpriced and underwhelming","The book part of the duo is no more than a pamphlet, less than 1/4"" thick and 6"" wide, 63 pages covering 12 pretty simple techniques for creating templates for wedding albums. All are well explained and illustrated. None is breathtakingly original. The dvd part of the duo provides a few more templates, a little bit more complex, well demonstrated. Again, nothing mindblowing. The basic lesson to be learned is work smarter not harder, create templates when you can, and automate as much as possible. Basic requirement is general (not advanced) familiarity with Photoshop."
2,"Nice Packaging, but Not Much Substance","I bought this package thinking that it would have some really good techniques on retouching wedding photos and when I got it, the book and DVD only covered basic Photoshop techniques that are applied to wedding photos. I would recommend this package to beginners, but for the mid to expert Photoshop users; I recommend passing on this."
1,No good,Save your money and learn Photoshop yourself..this CD is poorly presented. the author stumbles and fumbles and is hard to understand.
2,Bal tog flamenco skirt,"I bought this skirt for flamenco dancing and sent it back. Though nice for just regular wear or as a modern dance skirt, it is very wimpy when worn for expressive flinging of your skirt as done in flamenco dancing. I was very disappointed."
1,too short,"i am usually a size small, so i ordered a medium (i was adviced to do so by one of the reviews). its so short i need at least 4 inches extras in the lenght(im 5'7"", its more of a long skirt for tiny people!!! its too thin for flamenco dancing but it has pretty color!"
1,A piece of junk,"I bought this for my son, who uses whiteboards quite a lot. I returned the first one because it developed two big cracks in it in about 3 days. I got the new one and within two days, there was a small crack. So I returned them both. Too bad, these were the size I needed."
4,Quite good.,"This book is a good time; it has excellent characterization, an intriguing plot, good pacing and action, and manages to be thought-provoking in spite of not taking itself overly seriously. The only thing keeping it from five stars is that it gets a bit silly at times, but not so much as to be a real distraction. Definitely recommended."
2,Not so great,"I did not care for this item because it was too big for an average height baby to touch the ground in. It is big and not easy to disassemble. Also, the sound never worked. Bummer."
1,Poor compilation with little to recommend,"This book was recommended to me as a general cosmology appetizer and an overview of trends in the fields and opinions of its chief players. I must say that I enjoyed many of the interviews in the book and the colourful characters that emerge, but found this volume to be quite disappointing in the balance. It was rushed in its display of the modern ideas, even given that it was written in 1995, and seemed to give too much credence to current understanding as a sure thing rather than the hazy and incomplete picture it actually is. The book was fine in covering the origin theories but stumbled when considering the cosmological future, the writing about which should have been omitted. The sequence and flow of the interviews also seemed rather poorly organised. I did enjoy some of the questions posed about the formation of galaxies and the so-called Great Wall, however-- quite intriguing indeed. This nevertheless was not enough to redeem the book."
3,The Killing Time a good time killer,"Made in 1987, The Killing Time is the kind of unambitious, low-budget crime thriller that Roger Corman would have produced in the 50s. It stars B-movie veterans Beau Bridges and Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall), plus then newcomers Kiefer Sutherland and Michael Madsen (Resevoir Dogs). The story is basically a Double Indemnity retread set in sleepytown California. The story has some implausible parts and they could have thought the story out a bit better, but I enjoyed seeing a lot of good actors work together in this one, and I liked that the movie ended with a fistfight over a pistol on a rural California beach. Also, I liked that the Kiefer Sutherland's character has no name and his past and his motives remain unexplained at the end of the film.I realize this film was not well received by critics when it came out, but I think fans of these actors and fans of The Fast and the Furious (1954) will enjoy it. The DVD has no extras."
4,The Killing Time,"The Killing Time seemed a bit off.. The quality of the movie was strange and blurry. Other then that, the DVD was delivered on time and the price was right."
1,We are DC COMICS and we are GREAT!,"I love DC comics and comics in general but this self absorbed ""documentary"" makes me feel sad for the comics industry. Never have I seen such a ""we are great"" hammer to the head attitude in a documentary before. The political bias is OVERPOWERING as well. This dvd actually did the opposite of what I'm sure the creators had in mind. This overview of DC comics history leaves me cold."
3,Disappointing,"DC has a long and interesting history but this 'documentary' skips over most of the really interesting stuff and offers up a bland overview instead. I guess that's to be expected as this is a DC product but a little more depth would have been nice. It would have been terrific to see some featurettes added to acknowledge the ghost artists who did the bulk of the work on Bob Kane's Batman comics, the DC case against Captain Marvel comics, etc. Instead, we get a 90 minute promo video that barely scratches the surface."
4,Solid planning document,"Although the title indicates that this book is designed for the industrial arena, I found it just as applicable to healthcare organizations as well. It is easy to follow, provides excellent checklists and descriptions and very good explanations. In addition, it provides other resources to use for emergency planning. The terminology fits virtually all businesses, even though the term ""plant"" is used throughout. It has become the basis for the rewrite of the emergency managemement plan at my hospital. Of the many books I've reviewed, this stands at the top on emergency planning."
1,"The video lies when it says ""Fishburne"" is in this film","Neither Lawrence Fishburne, nor any other Fishburne is actually in this film. The lead black actor is named Reggie De Morton. The film was originally released in the late 1980s as ""Alien Warrior"" with the correct actors listed on the video jacket, but then when it was re-released in the mid 1990s the distributors put a picture of Reggie De Morton on the cover along with catch phrases which hinted that Lawrence Fishburne was a part of the film. It seems they figured that all black people looked alike, and apparently Amazon.Com has fallen for the con so much so that they now spread this false advertisement as well."
4,Reminded me of a few things in my youth.,Encouraging film letting us know that we can't give up on what we want. The acting was kind of so so but I did enjoy the plot.
1,Awful,"The ""acting,"" if you can call it that, is terrible. I've seen better high school productions. The production values are so awful as to negate any empathy one might have with the characters. Don't waste your money."
4,BAD ACTING BUT CUTE MOVIE,"The acting wasn't the greatest, but the movie itself was good. I especially liked the ending. Must have been made on an extremely low budget. Again, another movie I am glad I added to my movie library."
4,Gentle love story.,"I disagree with the review that says this is badly acted. It may not be Streetcar Named Desire, but it is a gentle story of love, and the acting helps to bolster the clash of cultures and beliefs. I enjoyed it, and the chemistry between the two handsome young men is quite believeable."
3,Buget film but cute,"Yes, it is low budget, and the acting sometimes is a bit stilted here and there, but overall it is a cute film.Happy Ending and all.Buy it used or on markdown. You can always donate it to a Gay Youth Organization in your area. What....you don't have one. Well there's a project for you now!!"
1,No Hollywood Hit Here,"If you are looking for a story line, good acting, secrecy, suspense, unsuspecting love. then buy Maurice. Under One Roof has none of the qualities that makes a movie, not only a hit, but at least interesting enough to watch all the way through. I had to force myself awake through endless minutes of idiocy where I just thought- what is the big deal. It seems to me that the movie focused on how the love between two mean was so hidden for the danger it would impose on the two of them. Honostly, how long does it take for two gay men who attracted to each other and to realize the attraction. Apparantly it takes the never ending length of the movie. Perhaps it should be titled ""The Tale Under One Roof That Never Ends"". My recommendation is to save your money and buy something else. If you are looking for a type of move that identifies impossible attractions then I recommend The Trip, or Maurice."
3,ONE SIDED LOVE AFFAIR,"I felt the Asian actor attempted to do a good job in his part. However, I got the impression the white guy never got into the part and was ""just there"". Overall a good script that would have been excellent with two actors who were excited to play the parts they each signed on for. Maybe one day it will be done again with actors who want to act."
5,Under One Roof,I thought I had already reviewed this product. I love this movie. I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
1,What a nightmare!!!,"This must be one of teh worst movies I have ever seen! It is shot like a home-made video and the actors play horribly! I do not know who cast the mother and her son (two main characters), but those people surely know nothing about playing. The movies sucks in every aspect! Save your time and money!!!"
2,One of the worst films I've ever seen,"I've seen many 'gay themed' movies but this one has to rank as one of the worst! The acting is horrible, the lighting is horrible...well, it is a low budget offering. But this is about as low as one can get.The movie does have some redeeming qualities: the casting of the two leads is o.k. Not great, but o.k. The casting of the best friend of the Chinese Boy (I think the character's name was Tony) was horrendous. Where did they find this guy? I can't believe anyone would touch him with a ten foot pole. He gave me the creeps...yet he had so many affairs in this film...something that was totally unbelievable to me. I give this film two stars instead of one because of the believability of the two main leads. But the script, the supporting cast and all the production values are simply terrible. This movie was a complete waste of time and money."
1,Find another movie...quickly...don't even think about this,The story line was bad. The acting was worse. The production is acknowledged by most as cheap. Enough said. I felt like I had been cheated out of my movie money!
1,UNDER ONE ROOF - DVD,"Extremely bad acting, appalingly flat direction and an atrocious screenplay make this one of the most tedious films I have ever had to endure watching."
4,A different David Hobson,"I was surprised by this album. It showcases a different David Hobson, not the operatic one. But, if you listen and listen again, you will hear a voice that can do many things in addition to singing opera. It grows on you the more you listen and sometimes the voice is otherworldly. While I look forward to David's new opera aria album (PLU321178), I will contrast this album with his earlier La Boheme and the new one to absorb the full rich range of capabilities. I would love to hear him sing a duet with la Diva Brightman!"
1,"It looks good, but","It looks good but it doesn't perform good, could not get the flame adjusted correctly, and there is no place to connect the igniter."
2,A bit misleading,The venturis were about an inch too short for the 34545 model - there are several subseries of this model but if you have just the 34545 then it is too short. The product is NOT stainless steel - failed the magnet test hard. It could be an aluminized steel or a plated steel (based on reflectivity) but it is NOT stainless. Not sure if it is worth the hassles of returning - maybe they count on this
4,Amazon Product not as pictured..,This item was not as advertised. It was pictured as Wax Works Finish and I was not told until the product was sent to me that it was instead Wax Works Flexible Style Medium. I can use it but I would not have bid on it had I known it was not WW Finish. Thanks...I think...
3,Dated? Yes. Important? Definitely.,"If you're looking to learn the newest techniques for transfering images to fabric, this isn't the book. Jean Ray Laury offers more, as do other artist/authors. But, this book was innovative 20 years ago, when I first read it and considered it a ""must-own"" five-star book. And, there's a lot to be said for the creative energy in books like this. At the time, this book took enormous chances to bring new and innovative techniques to a fabric community where ""fabric art"" most often meant traditional pieced quilts in tasteful calicos. It was a vitally important book in my development as an artist, and--if you're tracing the history of contemporary fabric art--I recommend this book."
1,Not very durable - Black and Decker machine chews up whole spool in minutes,Bought a large spool thinking it would last a long time in a Black and Decker GH1000 machine. Both top and bottom spools were chewed up in few minutes. String seems too tough for the cutter on machine to chop when extra string is fed out. I replaced the string with some other brand and it worked well. Seems to be this particular string and not the machine.
3,disappointed,"After reading all the glowing reviews of this coffeemaker, I guess I expected something better. while the coffee is good, the product itself has some flaws. First, the gadget that keeps the coffee from dripping when the pot is taken off the hotplate stopped working the first time I removed the top portion for cleaning. Also most of the time I only make a few cups at a time, and I hadn't had problems with the temperature of the coffee. The other day, however, I made a full pot, and not only was the coffee not hot enough, but it spilled, on a new tablecloth, when I tried pouring it into some mugs. I haven't given up on the coffeemaker yet, but I considering buying something else."
3,Not Up to the Task,"I thought I was taking a gamble when we bought a Braun coffemaker. You win some, you lose some. The brew cycle is excruciatingly slow, and I don't like to interrupt a quarter of the way thru to draw off one cup. Furthermore, the coffee is never hot -- almost, but not hot. I've used only two other name brands in the past 30 years, and I will definitely go back to one of those. In defense of the Braun, it's lasted a good two to three years under heavy use. This is the first time, though, that I've ever replaced a coffeemaker before it died outright."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"On the second day the little spokes that hold on the lid broke. We decided we could live with that. Then things got worse. There was no way to ever pour coffee or water from the carafe without spilling. We poured over the sink. But what sent me to Macy's yesterday to get a new coffee maker was the on-off switch. We frequently found it on when we hadn't intended. It was too easily bumped when working in the kitchen. The machine started the other evening 45 minutes after my husband had filled the tank with water, but while the carafe was still in the dishwasher. By the time we heard the last gurgles from the other room there was hot water all over the kitchen counter. The on-off switch had been sitting in a half-way possition. I must admit that the coffee was good. We thought we were being very frugal getting a good deal, but not in the long run."
1,JUNK!,"The #1 Rated Consumer Reports Braun KF400's flimsy plastic parts can not hold up under 2 washes on an ordinary cycle in a dishwasher (and no mention by Braun that the product is NOT dishwasher safe). The dispenser became malformed after the first wash under minimal heat, and the clip-on part of the pitcher's top broke off. The second washing destroyed the dispenser altogether as a vital plastic piece completely broke off, disabling the machine from working altogether! I threw the the machine out after only using it a dozen times and lost my money. If you purchase this coffeemaker be prepared to have permanent coffee stains, residue and odors on the product, for it is impossible to completely clean this effectively outside of the dishwasher. Total Crap!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a real piece of garbage! Obviously cheap parts, and the filter basket never stays in place. I have it for under a month, and am getting ready to throw it out."
5,"AT LAST, A SIMPLE, CHEAP, GOOD OPERATING COFFEE POT","This is a great little coffee pot... no extra bells or whistles... just a well engineered product that makes a great cup of coffee. Very easy to clean. When not in use, all the access doors can be opened and the machine can air dry-- no problem with mold getting started in the machine. (...)"
2,design flaws,"While it makes OK coffee, there are two major problems with this coffeemaker. First, the pot doesn't pour properly. As far as we can figure out, there's no way to pour coffee from it without at least some of it spilling and missing your mug. Second, if the pot isn't placed exactly right in the coffeemaker for brewing, the coffee doesn't flow down into the pot. We've always noticed it before disaster struck, but I imagine if you walked away without noticing you'd have a pretty big mess when the coffee overflowed the cone."
4,Good Coffee!,"I've been using this coffee maker for about a year and I really like it. It makes a wonderfull, steaming pot of coffee for me every morning. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the design of the pause-and-serve function. It never really worked very well on my coffee maker, dripping water onto the plate every time I pulled the carafe out before the pot was done brewing. Last week the whole mechanism for the pause-and-serve snapped off when I (carelessly) grabbed the carafe out of the unit. I don't plan on replacing the coffee maker because it still works without that part."
4,Got it in '99 and still works great. Flaw: spills coffee,"We are not big coffee drinkers so we use this Coffee maker once a week, aprox. My in-laws are big coffee drinkers though so, when they come visit we use it a lot. Makes good coffee, warm enough (saw some reviews about getting cold coffee from it. I am not into boiling coffee but, I think it is hot enough. I usually wait a few minutes to make sure I don't burn my tongue). I tend to break things easily (have broken all my wedding glasses!) but, I have not broken the carafe once. The only problem I see with this coffee maker is that if you are eager to pour your coffee into your cup, you will end up spilling half of it. I've learned to pour it slowly since the pouring design of the carafe is somewhat poor."
4,Excellent coffee maker,"This is a great coffee maker, very inexpensive, for people who just want a good mug of coffee and don't need all the bells and whistles. I was very pleased to find this model still available."
5,CONSUMER REPORTS' BEST BUY:,"After paying $100+ for three different high-end coffeemakers and having trouble with all of them.......from little, but necessary, parts breaking shortly after purchase to having them clog up due to our hard city water, I found a review of coffeemakers in one of our recent issues of Consumer Reports. They listed this coffeemaker as a Best Buy, due to it working wonderfully, making great coffee and being very inexpensive. We couldn't be happier to have a hundred dollars back in the bank and having a good cup of coffee in the morning. I can't recommend this coffeemaker enough!"
4,Braun KF400-WH Aromaster,The coffeemaker works great but the lid on the caraffe does't stay on since the notches that hold it in place break down easily. This is my second coffeemaker of this type and it has happened on the second one also.
4,good coffee pot,"like the braun coffe pot very much, especially the gold screen that i bought with it, instead of useing filters all the time. makes soem of the best coffee i have had. The first pot was borken in transit, but amazon replaced it right away, apreciated the speed in which they replaced the broken one. thanks for a good product"
5,a best buy,"I just replaced my last Braun Aromaster Coffeemaker after 16 years. Very reliable, few quirks (they did away with that silly plastic spout), and it makes a great cup of coffee. Better than Starbuck, by far. Don't waste money on the replacement plan."
4,Small Price/Great Coffee,I bought this coffee maker as recommended by CR and am very happy with it so far. I do agree with some of the complaints but for the price I feel it makes great tasting coffee. I share with coffee lovers my coffee secret. Mix a bag of Starbucks and bag of an off brand coffee. Enjoy a great pot of coffee for half the price.
3,You can fix it yourself,"I got one of these and had both the ""filter basket won't close tightly"" problem and the ""pause and serve feature leaks"" problem. I disassembled the pause and serve and put it back together, spending maybe 4 minutes on this, and it worked fine. It was misaligned. I had to trim a little excess plastic off the filter basket with a pocketknife to make it close tightly. That took less than 10 minutes to diagnose and fix. Since then, the pot has worked just fine, and made good coffee. Unfortunately, I dropped a can of beans on it one day and broke the filter basket hinge, so now I am in the market for a new pot. (I tried to use ""plastic weld"" gule to fix taht , too, but it did not hold.) I am considering another one of these pots (since I now have an extra carafe) but may go with the Bunn instead."
2,Cheap Filter Basket Broke,"I used this product only once, and now I can't close the filter basket anymore. Well, I can, but I have to stick my finger under the basket to flip up the mechanism that holds it in place. The system is just cheap plastic, which is why all the little parts at the bottom of the basket don't work like they should.I'm returning this product today."
5,Great coffeemaker!,We replaced a $50 coffeemaker with this one recommended by Consumer Reports - and they were RIGHT! It is GREAT! I would highly recommend it.
2,Worked Well for About Four Months,"It makes coffee rather well, still. But the stop-valve under the basket broke after about four months, and the clips holding the carafe lid snapped off not much later. I bought it on the recommendation of the Amazon and Consumer Reports ratings, and I must say that one shouldn't expect durability at a $15 price point. I still have it and use it, because I don't believe in discarding a device which is basically functional. Therefore, two stars.Hope this helps."
1,The worst coffeemaker I ever bought,"I needed a coffemaker & I bought this Braun since it was well known name and had a good rating. I would like to meet the person who gave this a #1 rating. The first day I got it - The hinged cup would not stay closed & the coffee wound up on my counter. I had to hold it close to get a cup of coffee.The markings inside the black one are hard to see so you never know if you are making the right amount of cups. I decided to buy another one and bring the original back as defective. I opened up the new box and would you believe it, I had the same problem. The hinged cup would not stay shut. The product is poorly made,very cheaply. The braun name is not what it used to be. ""Buyer Beware""."
2,Tepid Coffee,"I bought the Braun based on past reviews, but I didn't remember anybody commenting on the tepid coffee or the coffee filter holder that kept swinging out whenever you removed the coffee pot from the warmer. I eventually bought a Mr. Coffee that serves hot coffee."
1,Cold coffee anyone?,"You get what you pay for. I would never recommend this to any serious coffee drinker. I received this as a gift-- not a good coffee machine at all! The water temp was very low (optimal brewing temp should be 190-200F) resulting in a lukewarm cup of coffee. It also took forever for the burner to reach a decent holding temperature. The brewer did not have good water dispersment. Another negative is that it took a very long time to brew a pot. I ended up giving this coffee machine away. The only thing good about this machine was the optional mesh filter...which I have to admit was very cool and worked great. If your're a serious coffee drinker, please spend the money on a Bunn (I have the A-10 model...works great!). Don't cheap out on a plastic Krups/Braun/Mr.Coffee-- they are just not powerful enough to make a decent brew."
1,Zero-star review,"Beautiful unit, looks great on my black Corian counter top.Too bad the delicious coffee this thing produces is luke warm.The hot pad does manage to keep the pot of coffee tepid.If you are looking for a unit that makes coffee you can CHUG down, this is it. So try to contact Braun to report a problem... ha. They obviously don't care about feedback. I sure hope Amazon is more responsive and takes this thing back rather than referring me to an authorized repair center. Mr. Coffee, sorry I cheated on you... will you take me back? I swear, if this hadn't been a gift, I never would have strayed. Again, luke warm when it comes out of the little hole, hot plate doesn't get it any hotter. Total bummer."
5,Excellent Coffee Maker!,"I am drinking a cup of coffee from this coffeemaker as I write this; it's delish! This machine is inexpensive to purchase and it requires less coffee than other coffeemakers I have used. Combined with the gold filter available as an extra, and you have excellent coffee at a value price. Easy to use, easy to clean, the best coffeemaker that I've found."
4,Worked perfectly until the carafe broke.,"This was a humble coffee maker that made an excellent cup of coffee. When the carafe broke, we ended up buying an aeropress. The replacement carafe cost more than the whole coffeemaker when we bought it, and when it broke the coffeemaker was suddenly difficult to locate."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I cheaped out and bought this coffee maker for work. Wow, is it flimsy. Works fine, but it is not the same as the classic Braun coffeemaker. It is much more cheaply made. Plastic is already falling apart!"
2,Darn thing just stinks,"This is my second Braun, since my research said they're good for the price. I am not ""Godzilla"" as another reviewer wrote, saying that the parts are not so delicate and that you'd have to ""be Godzilla to break the Braun."" This is the second to stop pausing when I remove the carafe. Mornings are tough enough, but when coffee pours onto a hot plate and covers my entire kitchn counter, it's a horrendous mess. The swinging basket slides open whenever it feels like it, which stops brewing, yet all the pieces are in place. I do not recommend this version of Braun."
1,Awful coffeemaker,I bought this on the recommendation from Consumer ReportsIt was number one ranked.But I disagree with their findings because this coffee pot wasfragile and broke after a week of use. The side cover would not shut all the way and the valveleaked when you removed the pot to pour your coffee. Don't waste your money!
2,You get what you pay for - Consider upgrading,"The coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee but you'll notice a consistent theme in the reviews - the main problem being the carafe. (Replacement carafes cost $5 more than replacing the entire coffee maker!)Over the past 15 years (we really like the coffee maker!) we have gone through three of these carafes - only to have them fail or break. They dribble coffee - have a cheap plastic hinge, and are the most fragile item we have to wash in our sink every day. As some reviews state, you just have to be careful - but then most of us are usually half asleep when we make our coffee.After the plastic drip stop mechanism on the coffee maker broke, we recently upgraded to the KF600. It has a sturdy metal thermal carafe and makes the same great cup of coffee. Paying a few extra bucks should prevent us from replacing anymore carafes."
2,HARD TO FIND PARTS !!,"LOVE THE COFFEE MAKER, BUT BROKE THE CARAFE AFTER 3 MONTHS, CANNOT FIND REPLACEMENT. AMAZON.COM DOES NOT CATALOG THE 10 CUP CARAFE, AND BRAUN IS BACK-ORDERED ""FOR WEEKS"". SO WE ARE BACK TO USING THE CORNING-WARE POT RECEIVED 42 YEARS AGO AS A WEDDING GIFT."
4,"Braun KF400-WH Aromaster 10-Cup Coffeemaker, White","We are very satisfied with this low-cost cofeemaker that makes a very good pot of coffee. The cost of a replacement carafe is apparently high, which is a worry."
5,"Good product, works great.","This is a good coffee machine, it works fine, and is easy to clean.We give it a top rating, as it does what we want."
4,Great no-frills machine,"Makes a good pot of coffee without bells and whistles. I grind my beans, so no need for timers. Brews a pot in under 8 minutes and stays fresh for up to an hour."
5,Great Coffee for a cheap price,No bells or whistles but it yields a lot of cups per coffee used. It may be the filter type. Highly recommend it.
2,Not Quite Braun's Usual Quality,"I have had a number of Braun coffee makers. This is the first unit that was not up to Braun's typically high standards. The unit is lighter weight and not as well designed compared to Braun units I have previously owned. One of the prongs that hold the lid on broke after a few months normal use and it is awkward to get the carafe centered over the heating plate - the carafe wants to slide off to one side. I normally love Braun products, but would not recommend this one other than for occassional use - such as at a beach or mountain house where it doesn't have to meet the rigors of every day use."
4,She loves her coffiee maker,"I purchased this coffee maker for a friend and she just love it. She drinks coffee, allday-everyday. This was the perfect gift because she can set it to start brewing in the morning or anytime for that matter.....and there it is. Ready and waiting for her when she wants it."
1,Wish I'd never bought it,"We'd had a Braun we loved for years, but it finally died. I saw the good review about the KF400 in Consumers Reports and its low price, so I bought it. We were disappointed right from the get-go. The carafe feels cheap and not at all substantial. The pause-while-pouring feature never worked. Worst of all, after about 3 days, the hinged basket that holds the filter and coffee somehow got deformed so it would never snap shut. We discovered that problem when the basket sprang open while brewing and spewed coffee all over the counter. Thereafter, we had to hold it closed with a rubber band for it to work, which didn't look that attractive. I relegated the unit to the cellar and just bought a Cuisinart DCC-1200. It was $65 at Kohl's after sales and a $10 rebate, and so far it's working great. With the Braun KF400, unfortunately, I think you get what you paid for."
2,poor quality,This product began self destructing almost as soon as it was out of the box. The plastic is thin and flimsy. The little knobs that hold the lid on the pot broke within the first two weeks of use. The brew basket does not seat into place very well and frequently is out of place just enough that the autodrip feature stops the dripping causing all the water to stay in the brew basket. The coffee itself is fine.
2,"Just bought, it's going back","It might make a good cup of coffee but mine never made it that far.It came made of quite flimsy plastic. The plastic parts, especially around the swing out filter, don't align anywhere near properly, and the swing out filter doesn't quite lock into place. So it's going back to the store today. Which is a shame because I'm dying for a good cup of joe!Pretty sure I am going to spend the extra money and get a sturdier model that looks better and works well, the Cuisinart DCC-1200."
4,it will stick with your forever!,"I read this book because of the title. The author tells us a story about death and unexpected moments in life. After I read this book I've found myself thinking ""tomorrow in the battle think on me"" very often! Also this book changed my views on death, on dealing with it, and what happens to those left behind after someone's gone.Great book about thoughts and ideas not so much about events."
1,is this book FOR idiots or BY idiots??,"Either way i found i couldn't relate. What little i knew about the CIA or specific missions (e.g., TPAJAX, Gautamala, etc.) was either wholly inaccurate, blandly whitewashed, or both! The authors have done an admirable job of what one may say is googlizing research (and a poor one at that) and compiling it all into what may vaguely be called a book.With poor-quality and error-prone books such as this, esp. one on a topic of much import to world affairs of the past half century, one wonders if the cycle of idiocy isn't perpetuated ad infinitum."
3,Bit of a rip-off.,"I bought this book for one specific reason: To learn how CIA agents are trained. There was almost NOTHING about CIA training. Aside from that, the book is good. I give it 2 and a half stars."
3,What's sweet now turns so sour...,"There was a time when you couldn't swing a wedge of cave-aged gruyere around at the theatre without hitting yet another ""Hitchcockian"" French thriller (circa ""The Bride Wore Black""). Apparently, the Gallic thrall with all things Hitchcock (and Jerry Lewis) continues unabated, as evidenced by ""Merci Pour Le Chocolat"". Isabelle Huppert, as the central character, deadpans her way through a twisty little family tale that falls somewhere between ""Prince & The Pauper"" and ""Serial Mom"". I agree with other reviewers that the abrupt denouement was an unfortunate choice by the director, as it cheapens the intrigue of the setup. What you're left with would have made a perfect 45-minute teleplay, perhaps a segment on the old ""Night Gallery"" program or ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", but not really feature-length material. Good performances from an earnest cast make this one worth a look on a slow night, but (excuse my French) it ain't no ""Family Plot""!"
3,Some good info but pretty light weight,"I really wanted to like this book because I agree with his theological stand, but I found myself somewhat disappointed with the book. The first 56 pages are not much more then a quick ""what they teach"" and then ""relevant information"" which turns out to be definitions of the terms he plans on using in the next 50 some pages.The end of the book does give some very good information, but is not very in depth. I found myself agreeing with the author's over all position, but questioning some of the minor points. Unfortunately the book was not in depth enough for me to be truly sure what some of his positions were on those minor issues."
1,where is the article?,"unfortynately, i still did not get my article after weeks of my orderso quite upset"
2,"great comedy, poor sound quality","Ahmeds show could hardly be heard, sound all muffled. It got a little better half way threw. hardly made it worth the 24.95 paid for it. I would never recomend this."
3,Funny but sound quality poor.,"It was funny. A lot of repeated material from the Axis of Evil comedy tour, but lots of new matierlal, especially the girl at the end. It was great - my only complaint was the sound quality. You had to turn up the volume very loud to hear some parts, and you still missed other parts because of the sound quality."
1,Bad Production,"I've seen Ahmed Ahmed live and on ""The Axis of Evil"" comedy tour DVD. He is a very good comedian, but the production of this DVD is just so bad. The audio is amaturish and the Videography is just terrible. I also didn't think that Ahmed was into this show either. He seemed slow and hesitant. I was expecting another exceptional show, but it just didn't materialize. The other two comedians were hampered by the same production flaws, this just isn't a good DVD."
2,bad production,"the production of this dvd was very low, could hardly hear what the comedians where saying on stage without having a very high volume on my sound system.great comedians, but the quality of the dvd pulled down the enjoyment of it all unfortunantly."
3,middle east stand up comedy,"This dvd comes before Axis of Evil. The begining is a little shacky and the audio is not very good. The dvd doesn't look like it was shot by a professional. The contents are funny, but the Axis of Evil is better quality. On this video there is one lady comedian and she is great. I did enjoy this DVD to a point."
2,Disappointing,"My overall impression of the book is that whilst at first glance it is organised into logical chapters (the reason I purchased the book), the contents within the chapters is presented haphazardly.The author jumps from one topic to another without fully explaining whats going on and presents some confusing examples, some of which do not work. Not impressed at all"
1,I was robbed,"This is the least useful book I have ever bought. It doesn't have anything useful and didn't answer me any questions I had. No wonder it was so cheap. I spent $9.95 for the book from Amozon, but I feel like I was robbed. I can give it to you for free if you ask for, but I would be guilty if I do, becuase it would waste your valuable time. Look at other's review and I was not the only victim, don't buy this one, it is 100% garbage."
2,Not Really Good for Beginners,"I expect that this book will help me learn ASP.NET thru VB.NET. I am very frustrated, it didn't really help me to easily understand the simple thought of ASP.NET thru VB.NET. For beginners like me, I will not suggest this book. Much better to browse the web."
2,poorly written. But?,I bought this book from the bookstore to teach my students or i would say to use it as a class text for an intro to ASP.net programming using C# but to my surprise the author took this fine language and ASP.net product and did not know how to present it in writing for someone that is not expereinced to understand what he meant and as such could not recommend it to my students but if you do have some knowledge already about C# and Asp.net then maybe it will be worth it.The author is a good author but he missed this one.Because true kowledge comes when you can take something and explain it in simple terms to someone so that they can learn something.
3,Huh?,This product did not work. I don't think it was operator error but I can't confirm beyond a doubt.
4,Everyone Loves a Spoof...& Even Better a Spoof W/ Hot Chicks,I am adding this movie to my library. I happened onto it this weekend while my satellite company had a free movie weekend. I laughed so hard I was crying. It is always great to see a parody come out that can make one laugh so hard. And it did help a little that there were beautiful ladies and bits of soft core pron...lol.
1,It's amazingly silly!,"Sometimes so called ""video productions"" of this type is so bad, that it's even interesting and funny. Not this one! The cheapest, silliest, stupidest thing I ever saw. Good packaging, though! I am sure it sales. Don't bother - just throw your money in the garbage - same effect."
4,Sexy...and hilarious!,"Lord of the G-Strings may simply be one of the funniest movies I've ever watched. I rented it in hopes that the girls would be cute and the jokes would be somewhat funny. Both hopes were met and then some...Missie Mundae is just adorable! And I mean not only in physical appearance, but also in the way that she talks and acts. You'd never expect it from a porn star, but she is as funny and charming as she is sexy.The scenes are hilarious...we're talking about humor in the tradition of ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" (another classic parody), complete with jokes about the actors themselves, anachronisms, and more.This is a rare diamond in the dirt of unrated-low-budget-movies-that-are-really-just-pornos-except-you-can-get-them-from-any-video-store. Enjoy!"
3,Dumb fun,"OK, it's a stupid movie for the most part, but it's actually pretty funny at times.I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing what's already obvious, but LOTR fans will find a good cheap laugh from it. You get to follow the adventures of three scantily clad little ladies and their inebriated wizard buddy Smirnov. Their quest is to destroy the infamous G-String of Power. Along the way, they're waylaid by an army of Dorc warriors and Bruce, the Gay Knight.Like I said, it's not brilliant acting or comedy, but good for some laughs at the expense of other movies and the LOTR."
1,"If you liked ""Gladiator Eroticus"" you might like this...","... but if, like myself, you thought ""Gladiator Eroticus"" was a huge waste of time, then don't bother with this one. It's a lot of sophomoric Seduction Cinema humor interspersed with an occasional girl/girl scene. The multitude of guys in this video are a complete waste of time. THEY'RE JUST NOT FUNNY! As for the girl/girl scenes, they're mostly lame and unimaginative, as if the writers thought that just including them was enough in itself. Trust me, it's not. As a parody, as an erotic video, and as entertainment, this one fails miserably on all fronts."
2,"Good looks, No attention to detail","Once I got everything installed it looked good but getting to that point was an adventure. The Driver and Passenger brackets for the front were stamped DF and PF, but they were stamped on the wront brackets. Then the holes didnt line up. Because the holes didnt line up, the bolt was tilted in requiring smaller washers and you couldnt get a socket or box wrench on the nut. Also everything was supposed to be 1/2"", 5/8"" and 3/4"", but the 1/2"" stuff was actually 13mm. Overall just poorly engineered in my opinion."
1,not recommended by me,"poor sound quality. poor range. way too much static. for whatever reason, they never worked properly for us."
1,Very bad,This is a very bad product from JVC. The auto tuning sucks. The audio quality is very poor and some times it is like a dead. Waste of money. Do not buy this.
1,Waste of money,"These headphones are a total waste of money. The sounds cuts off on its own. There is a constant hissing sound and it picks up static when moving between rooms. As for range, it doesnt work even inside the apartment. Sometimes, it picks up some telephone calls from the neighbours!"
2,"its ok,,average",The qality of sound i will rate 3 out of 5 but it has lot of problems.1)The sound takes some time to start in headsets.2)Will only work properly in line of sight.3)Whenever a call comes in my wireless phone this starts giving lots of noice.4)The charging indicator kept on blinking.Didnt stop even after 30 hrs of charging.5)The range in which it works good is very less.Good for using with TV or surround system in same room.
1,Piece of Crap!,"I will not repeat the comments of the other folks critical of this product.All of their comments are right on. The JVC headphones are junk. Having experienced the same problems of hissing, not working beyond 10', etc. The final straw concerning this product is the fact I can't find a replacement battery. I thought originally the battery might have been the problem. After reading the reviews, I have come to the conclusion that the battery is fine, it's the headphones that are bad."
1,DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ON YOUR PET...............,"Both my cats got sick 2 hours after I used this product on them. (vomiting, diarrhea, seizing, foaming at the mouth, not eating or drinking for 2 days, hair falling out, etc). I followed the directions exactly. I recommend you not use this product on your pet."
1,Made cat sick! Scary!,"This was advertised to me as natural and safe to use on my cats. The instructions actually say to ""Spray the entire animal...spray until entire coat is damp."" I gave my cat one spritz to try it. As soon as she licked herself (like every wet cat will do) she began instantly foaming at the mouth to a pretty extreme extent. It was pretty scary. Even after she calmed down, another lick made it start right back up. I had to quickly run her into the shower to wash this stuff out of her coat. The instructions say not to apply to the pet's nose or mouth, but when it also says ""spray until entire coat is damp"" of course the cat will lick itself. Scary stuff. It may be fine for their bedding and everything else, but I won't ever spray this directly on my cats again."
1,Smells like VOMIT!!!,"Disgusting smell!! Now my cat and hands smell like vomit! I also bought the De Flea shampoo. It too has the same odor but not as strong. As to whether or not it works in spite of the smell.... No, not really unless you comb out the fleas with a flea comb then spray the spray directly on them while over a sink where you can wash them down the drain immediately afterwards..... At least that's the only way it's worked for us so far."
4,worked well,"I like the fact that this is a natural product, but I actually found a product at Lowe's that was cheaper"
3,Smells...well...,DeFlea products need a smell overhaul and this is no different. Doesn't last quite as long as the chemical cousins but knowing there is less pollution keeps the bottle in use. Can't necessarily stay in the room right after spraying but after an hour or so it is tolerable.
2,Didn't work,"We bought this product because our dog was infested with fleas, and we still had to wait to give him Frontline for this month. We sprayed his whole body and I massaged it in as recommended. Well, it didn't work. The next day he was an infested as before. And I think he had some sort of allergic reaction to it: the skin on his testicles was peeling off. Don't waste your time and money."
4,Good product - not so good packaging,"The product works very well; however, when I received the product, it had leaked into the plastic packaging. Not a big deal; but, it appears the bottle was not sealed properly."
5,One of Lovecraft's best volumes - hard to find!,"It's not fair to call Lovecraft a horror writer, as from his pen have come some of the most beautiful pieces of literature ever. Tales of the macabre, the ancient, the unspeakable. His narrative style draws you in immediately, engulfing you with the rich atmosphere of the Cthulhu Mythos. Some of Lovecraft's best works are collected in this volume - The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kaddath, The Shunned House, as well as numerous short stories. Whether you're a nouveau fan or an old aquaintance, pick this book up"
2,Buy for looks rather than substance....,"The turntable plays 33 1/3 12-15% faster than it should on my model. The speakers are also throughly mediocre sounding for such a large system. All and all, a rather dissatisfying performance."
3,Mr Gasket Dominator adapter,A decent product for the money. Not a perfect fit though. Needs a little tweaking on the studs.
4,Belly Button Jewelry.,"Was very pretty! I bought this for my daughter for Christmas but she's not used it yet because she never got her belly button pierced, not yet anyway she still plans to."
1,Sadly Unsuited for Smoothies,"Although this blender came highly recommended by Consumer Reports, I have been very disappointed by this unit's lack of durability, after giving it more than a fair chance: I have owned a total of 3 of these blenders (2 with the food processor attachment, one without). Two of the units were store bought and one was a factory replacement. I have used the machine to make smoothies 2-6 times a week and to accasionally puree soup. The motor failed on two of the units and the black plastic rotor on the base of the glass jar disintegrated on the third unit within 1-2 years of moderate use. If making smoothies is something you enjoy, then this is probably not a blender you should consider."
3,NOT a Smoothie!,"How interesting that I would recieve an email inviting me to review my new Cusinart Duet Blender/Food Processor while I'm drinking my berry smoothie that I just finished making in it!I can honestly only write about the activity of making a smoothie for this review. If making smoothies is why you need a blender, please don't purchase this one.For some reason they have designed the blades to be more than halfway below the bottom of the glass pitcher and ice, larger fruit (like strawberries) never get chopped up and if the concoction that you're making is a frozen type, it will just spin and spin and nothing actually makes it down into the blade area. Opening the top and stirring every 20 seconds to get the mix down to the blades is very frustrating and time consuming."
1,HORRIBLE,"This product is horribly LOUD. When using the food processor it creates such a shrill sound that everyone in my family runs outside...it's the instant headache-giving kind of noise. All of my friends and family hate this product and beg me not to use the food processor part because of the noise. This is my second one and they have both been the same. Customer service has told me twice that this is just the way the product is. Why would they put it on the market? In terms of processing and blending it works fine. It is not very durable - I've had two plastic pieces break off with just normal use. Even though it may seem like it saves a little space having two-in-one, save yourself the headache and buy something different. BTW, a friend has the 16c die cast and it sounds great."
5,The Borrowers Afield,"This book is one of my childhood FAVORITES! My first grade teacher read this book to us,leading me to read all the Borrowers books. The imaginaton in this book is fun, entertaining and such a sweet book."
5,The BEST children's books EVER!!,Do yourself and your child a favor and get all the delightful books in this series about the charming tiny people who live under the stove in the old kitchen. Wonderful for reading aloud.
5,classic,this is a classic album tom browne is young and hungry on this his first album listen how he comes across i'm telling you sit back with a survival kit and chill ya'll
4,Great for PDA's,"If you're a PDA super user, this product's for you. The ability to see the screen while you're driving is a must for PDA map navigation programs (like Street Atlas.) The power supply charges the PDA as you go, and the built-in speaker amplifies the sound better than the speaker in the PDA.Just don't get distracted while driving!"
3,Not going to Last,"I was looking for a weather-proof shock-resistant light. Ideally I wanted to find one with a rubberized housing. This one is just painted steel and is already starting to rust two months after I installed them. There is also condensation inside the light lens, so the ""heavy duty"" rubber seal is a joke. The give off good light now, to bad that I will probably have to replace them in the next 6-12 months."
1,"Item NOT as described, no help from KC","The description clearly states that it includes a relay and terminated wiring. it does not, it contains a DIY kit. The wiring kit described is sold for another $39. Make sure you factor that in to your comparison.The lights are well made, although I am concerned about rust on the painted steel housing, the mounting is solid and the hard plastic covers fit good and snug.I did contact KC regarding the lack of described parts but they said it was my issue to take up with Amazon. If they will not stand behind their product from day one what will they do for the remaining 23 years of warranty? I think I will return these and go with a leading brand."
3,Not Bad,"Well, the lights look pretty cool. The wiring kit included is not sufficient. All and all they are nice lights, just ensure you have your onw wiring supplies."
3,Could be better,I have had these for 3 years and used them off-roading 5 or 6 times. I am a little disappointed in the quality with specific reference to the wire where it goes into the back of the light assembly. For the price of this assembly it could be better. The housing is very nice and the light is very bright and there is no water in the assembly despite the fact that they did not have the decency to put a watertight grommet on the rear of these lights where the wires go in. How much could it have possibly cost to provide a stupid grommet?
5,Super easy and bright,"The KC's are so bright! they are very easy to install, very detailed instructions. I would highly recommend these to anyone."
4,Flip Flop Yeeah!,"No disrespect intended. This is one of the sharpest ""horror"" films from Asia yet. There's a guy who moves in to some bedsit...always a bad move because he ultimately learns why he shouldn't have. The downside is that I couldn't understand what they were saying, much less identify the language...until the end....No matter what, this film will keep you hooked (I really don't believe in spoilers) and if you feel like taking a chance, take a chance on this one.Come on, Amazon, send me my copy. It's been on order long enough!"
5,Exceptionally well illustrated and informative.,"One of the best books on the Cairn Terrier in decades. It is well-written and full of information without overwhelming the reader. From the history of the breed and its gorgeous color photos of the breed's ancestors to choosing, training, grooming and showing a Cairn it's VERY well illustrated with hundreds of beautiful glossy color photos.This book won't go on the shelf never to be opened again.An excellent easy to ready reference tool and a beautiful coffee-table book!"
2,Not for regular people,"Unless you are going to breed or show, don't buy this book. Three of the chapters aren't even written by the author. Breeding history and standards make up most of the book. The functional sections give very little useful information."
5,Great Book,"Love this book, contains great information about a breed that I knew almost nothing about. Life is Merrier With a Terrier!"
5,very very good goth/progressive metal,"This is an awesome album. Paradise Lost and The Gathering is what i think of this band. I first heard them in the bonus cd you get when you buy A Dead Poem by Rotting Christ. I thought that song might have been on In A Reverie, but it didn't matter anymore cause this album is really good. Statley Lover and Reverie are the highlights of the album,. but the rest is really good too. Awesome writing and great vocals. The vocals are very early Theatre of Tragedy, the male/female shared vocals. Wish more keyboards were in this album,it would add to the beauty of the album."
5,Beautiful!,"This CD is truly magnificent - Highlights for me were ""To Myself I Turned"" and ""Falling Again"", brought tears to my eyes, very emotional!"
5,I love this CD,"I'm usually a fan of heavy music, but I came across this through an article in Revolver Magazine. Since I couldn't find it in stores, I had to get a special order on it. I finally got my hands on it a week later. After the 2nd time of listening, I fell in love with Cristina's angelic voice. The chick got me hypnotized, you know. Their whole sound is dark and beautiful(not to be confused with Dark & Lovely). I think it's unfair to rate this CD with only 5 stars because this CD is the best CD I own that isn't heavy as fxck. This is music to make babies to! A true classic!!!"
1,Tasteless and mediocre,"I thought this was good, after all their first Ep is quite cool. Big mistake! ""In a reverie"" is painfully dumb! Most of it is mediocre heavy rock that tries to emulate the contrast between clean female and gruff male vocals which other bands did successfully, but Lacuna Coil fails miserably in doing so. This album lacks excitement, originality, good riffs, and decent lyrics.Stay away from it!"
1,Ugh!!,I don't know what the hell some of these people are talking about. This CD sounds so lame and dated it's not even worth joking about. Do yourself a favor and avoid this crap and pick up Evanescece instead.
4,A pause before greatness,"On their first full-length release, following their self-titled debut EP, Lacuna Coil are poised on the verge of greatness. The CD's opening track ""Circle"" is a masterpiece and hints at what is yet to come from this Italian powerhouse in the future. The rest of the tracks are perfectly adequate, but don't really propel the band beyond what they showed us on their debut EP. The songs are well-crafted and highly listenable, and Cristina Scabbia continues to be the best voice in rock today. Other standout tracks are ""Stately Lover"" and ""To Myself I Turned."" With this first full-length effort, Lacuna Coil deliver a quality release while only hinting at the heights to which they would soar on their subsequent releases."
4,"The ""Italian Evanescence""?","The ""Italian Evanescence"", it lives up to the promise of ""Falling"" on their self-titled debut album, especially ""To Myself I Turned"" and ""Falling Again"". Not as great as the ""Karmacode"" and ""Comalies"" albums, in part because they don't really use their dual vocalists to full advantage. My favorite band of all time."
3,Not very durable,"For the price that I paid for this toy,I would say it is really good.Otherwise,its not durable and it looks very cheap.I should say here that I paid $2.10 for this toy.Thanks amazon for such amazing deals"
3,Father Begrudgingly Reads to Son,"This book was a disappointment. The plot is that the father would rather read a newspaper than read books to his son. The book actually says something like ""When daddy just can't read anymore..."" In the end, the boy reads to his monkey, hoping that his monkey will learn to read by himself. I found it sad. My daughter who is 18 months old, however, loves this book. Perhaps she doesn't understand its meaning."
3,Dry Erase Board,"This dry erase board is ok. We find it does not erase well -- you can still see the writing (ghosting).Otherwise, it meets our needs."
4,Well worth it,"I remember watching this show when I was a kid and it's just as much fun. It's actually a TV show that I could watch with my 5 year old niece, because it's '70's sanitized'....blood is amusingly fake but the action is real. The show as a whole is a fine example of what TV was when it was all about making entertainment.its fun, its entertaining, its exciting. It's a show that inspired people to become firefighters and its a great reminder of just how advanced we've come in just a few decades. And sometimes it's just plain fun to play 'spot the famous guest star'"
3,Syndication is insulting,"I could not wait for season three of my favorette show as achild to come out, But I was dissapointed with it. Half of the episodes on this season, have a lousy picture and have opening titles from ""SEASON SIX"". I hope they don't do the same with Season's four and five, when they are released, I tried to contact universal to let them know , but could not make contact ""I WONDER WHY"".Why di they have to screw up shows of the 60's and 70's when they go on syndication? (did the same with Season one of the Twilight zone"").I like to see them the way they are originallly aired, like I remember them."
4,"show 5 stars, subtitles 3 stars","Emergency! is still a great show, but I find myself wishing mightily for extras. I ended up consoling myself with a book,Emergency!: Behind the Scene, instead. The masters used for copying these shows showed their age in some episodes as well.It's clear that subtitles were done by different people, and, frankly, some of them weren't any good. Subtitles on specialty shows, like medicine and, presumably, law, can be hit-or-miss, and many of these are a miss. Good captioners/subtitlers exist for these, and some are here. Another, however, is terrible and simply invents things when he or she doesn't understand the dialogue. This leads to some amusing substitutions, such as ""sinkable"" for ""syncopal."" Closed captions are not included with any Universal DVD properties that I'm aware of, so good subtitles are doubly important."
5,The Wait Is Over,"Emergency is one of my favorite shows. I was thrilled when I saw that Emergency season three was going to be released on DVD. The disc is 5 disc and singled sides, so I don't think we will have any problems. I'm glad Universal got moving again. I was worried that the other seasons would not be released. All Universal has to do now is release Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman on DVD. Thanks again Universal and thanks to Amazon for setting such a great price for their TV Shows on DVD. I would rate this show higher than 5 is I could."
5,Emergency Season 1,"As a kid I would always make time on Saturday nights to set down in front of the TV to watch Johnny and Roy and the others of Emergency. I did not know that you could buy these seasons on DVD and now that I have found them I want all them. I am a volunteer firefighter/EMT and these two guys are why I did it. It is the way they helped people out and could still joke back at the station, it is the same way we do it in real life, and now I am helping and saving people too. Thanks Johnny and Roy, and please keep the seasons coming and keep up the great work............"
4,"The Show is GREAT, but the DVD is not","The episodes were very good, but the quality of the picture and sound, while not nearly as bad as season 4's, were not as good as seasons 1&2. I had to return this set, because disc 3 was defective, and would not even play. Amazon was good and quick getting a replacement sent. I hope season 5 will be a lot better."
5,Love It,"Service was fast and my daughter and grandson are enjoying the DVD. He cannot wait to come home from school to watch the next episode. The other day he said to his mom, ""That Johnny sure has some strange ideas.""Since it was a Christmas request by his mother, we never dreamed that he would be interested in it. It was this show that sparked the idea that she would become an emt."
5,Another Rescue From Station 51,"This program continues to be entertaining and educational in its 3rd season. Gage and DeSoto and the rest of the firemen at Station 51 provide drama, and suspense, with some humor threaded in for our enjoyment. I would recommend this season along with the first and second seasons without any hesitation."
4,fine - but not as good...,"...as I expected after purchasing season one and two.I finally received Emergency! season three on DVD more than 4 weeks after ordering it. OK - oversea shipping takes usually a bit more time, but this was really the longest time they ever needed for one of my orders.When I opened the parcel I was a bit surprised to find no double DVDs any more, but single sided ones, which not even have a nice colorful label, but are rather kept simple - just white.So far, I have watched the first DVD and parts of the second. Actually, the quality of the sound seems a bit worse than it was on the previous seasons, the image quality seems OK to me.Nevertheless, it's great to reminisce about these heros of my childhood when watching the old episodes once again..."
1,Crap,"What a piece of junk. Barely picks up a radio signal, then randomly begins searching for other stations. You get what you pay for."
1,it's crappy,"This is a piece of junk. I purchased for my 9 yr old. You can not turn it off without removing the battery, it does't download songs for Itunes or any othe site. DO NOT BUY"
4,"Interesting, grooving textures, a solid mix front to back","Heard a track on SYTYCD, ( Jungle ), liked it, thought I'd just buy that track - on previewing the record, thought it was really good overall. Excellent workout music, background party music, driving music. Really cool stuff - like the focus on percussion. Recommended. Some tracks are very raw, tribal, authentic (as if they were just jammed out live) - other tracks are clearly studio creations. Both good!"

4,ONLY FOR THE CHOCOLATE LOVER!!!,"CURRENTLY, AMAZON HAS YET TO UPDATE THE NUTRITIONAL PROFILE OF THIS PRODUCT, ""LEAN BODY"", BY LABRADA. THERE ARE 330 CALORIES, AND THE NEW FORMULA HAS 8 GRAMS OF FIBER- AND I JUST SCRATCH MY HEAD AS TO WHY ITS TAKEN EVERYONE SO LONG TO PUT FIBER IN THEIR MEAL REPLACEMENTS. BE AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE, AS THE LABRADA ""CARB WATCHERS"" HAS ONLY 12 GRAMS OF CARBS, THIS ONE HAS 24. PERSONALLY, I REALLY LIKE THE VANILLA FLAVOR BETTER. THE CHOCOLATE REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME. IT DOESNT TASTE BAD, BUT I JUST EXPECTED MORE OF A CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM FLAVOR. NOT!!! BUT, THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT, AND IF YOU REALLY LIKE AND PREFER CHOCOLATE, YOU SHOULD BE OKAY WITH IT. BUT IF YOU'RE TORN IN BETWEEN, JUST GET THE VANILLA."
4,Good Book on Introduction to Philosophy,"If the book were writen in a clearer fashion, this book would appeal to a much wider audience. I enjoyed the information just had difficulties getting around the philosophical jargon that the author uses. Although the book is designed to teach students that are not in the field of philosophy, you will still need some basic understanding of the subject to comprehend the material."
5,Great Purchase,The workbook is like new. I will enjoy using it. Came in a timely fashion. Would recommend this provider to anyone.
3,"Not fancy, but works","While I wish this were bigger, it does fit well and still allows for the opening of the hidden storage area in the second seat. It is not elegant or fancy, but I have storage area and a place for trash."
5,Black Van Console,"I am really pleased with the Rubberqueen 5147 Black Van Console. I looked all overManitowoc, and all I found was garbage. I had one similiar to my black van consolethat was shot, and as I looked all over town I had noluck, until I went on Amazon,typed in what i WAS looking for and found the black one. Its great and looks good inmy 2006 Chrysler Town and Country."
1,Rubbish,"I have seen all Wesley Snipes films but this film was a load of rubbish, I would have thought his acting skills was above this but he looked like a second rate actor"
1,7 Seconds [Blu-ray],"Hi,The show is very good. But, you send me bad quality disc, having a lot of scratches. The plastic cover look like bike by the rat. Very poor quality control."
2,I should've read the reviews before renting it,"7 Seconds is a formulaic capper that's not entertaining at all. The car chases are ok, but nothing to write home about. It's a regular Snipes movie, but lacking fun. It's long, illogical (which isnt bad if it's entertaining), and just plain boring."
2,answering the '7 Seconds' question,"I am a Wesley Snipes fan, and not all that hard to please, but I must agree with previous reviewer - EAGAN, MN - that this is a lame movie and one I have no desire to ever see again. To answer the question about where the title came from, the timers on the phony explosive charges Snipe's gang uses on the first three armored cars, to get the more complicated robbery in motion, were set at 7 seconds. Just why this inconsequential fact deserves to be the title remains a mystery to me."
1,A horrible movie attempting to use Snipes name,"This truly is a horrible movie. 7 seconds, huh, yeah 7 seconds to realize I made a mistake in renting it. The acting is horrible, the plot is horrible, the filming is horrible... Everything is horrible! I was hopeful because of Snipes, which is why I rented it despite not ever seeing the movie anywhere before in the theaters. The guy at the store even told us that he was told it was a good movie! Snipes couldn't even do the fight scenes and make them look real. The ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love! Huh, they were a romantic interest? They hinted at it, but never showed this happening.Do not rent or buy this movie. Stay away, or you will be sucked into it shaking your head wondering why you rented this movie."
2,"Yup, Surreal Life for Wesley","Maybe he needed the dough? Whatever it is, this movie along with the other one he made (The Marksman) are pretty bad, 90 minute standard-action crap-ola.7 Seconds was a little better, but whoa the stench rotted my entertainment center for days.Sorry Wesley. For what it's worth; your not a bad actor. But your agent is selling you off to the lowest bidder.Good luck.."
1,"Plain and simple, it sucked!","Seven seconds, is about how long you want to watch this piece of garbage! No wonder I've never heard of this movie, it's a disaster! Almost every movie I've seen Wesley Snipes in is good. So I figured I was going to see a decent movie when I rented this. WRONG! It's very hard to understand, exactly what's going on in this movie. It was dragged out, and just plain ridiculous! Every review on Amazon for this movie so far is bad, we can't all be wrong."
4,Dont listen to most of these people see it for your self,Why people panned this movie on here I have no idea its a great action movie fast paced good scenes and shot great Snipes is the man
2,Poor Quality,"Was disappointed with this from the start, but was not worth the effort to return it. The belt clip, which I never use, was broken on arival and there are very sharp edges all around the stamping. It does not lock closed and plain looks cheap. Get a Rhinoskin instead."
2,Low review due to DOUBLING price $$$$$,Bought this for myself but accidently got sent to my son out of state. He said it worked great. I came back here 2 days later to order and it has doubled in price!!!! $7 to $14 crazy expensive for spray bottle. I am now going elsewhere.
3,"This is probably some good stuff, but...","This is probably some excellent power steering fluid. I am a huge fan of pretty much all Royal Purple's products. In my 1994 Mustang GT, I currently have Royal Purple in the engine, transmission, and in the differential. I wanted to run this power steering fluid in the same car, but the power steering pump threw a fit. It freaking went off. It was making and extremely loud noise and I was afraid it was going to ruin my power steering pump. So I drained all the fluid back out and put the cheapest non-synthetic fluid in the pump. The noise went away. I guess those pumps just don't like synthetic. But if you have a 94-95 mustang GT or cobra, I wouldn't buy this cause my pump hated it."
5,felt the difference,my powersteering had a leak so i bought 2 of these..and some at-205 reseal...i first put the power steering in there and it works much to my satisfactory...then i put the at-205 in..still leaked then the next day i put some more in and its been sealed ever since...i think the at-205 made my sensitivity on my wheel go down though...no big deal though
3,Just ok,I found this movie to be one of those that is nice to watch if you can't find anything else.
5,Polite sexy rent boy involved in a murder,"This movie is about a sadistic criminal who leads a double life with his kept rent boy in the city of London and his suburban wife and son. Daniel Newman as Tom the rent boy is fascinating to watch. Tom is charming and tragic.In return for an amazing loft apartment and incredible clothes, Tom is abusively exploited by his benefactor for his own sadistic gratification and as a reward for at least one cooperating corrupt London Metropolitan policeman.When Tom is befriended by his neighbor who lives downstairs, Tom's life and the neighbor couple's life quickly change for the worse.While Tom is forced to endure abusive loveless anal sex, this movie is not ""a gay movie,"" but a crime movie with a rent boy as the main character."
2,At best....,this is a 59 cent balsa wood toy. It is just way too much money for something that is not that much fun and does not last very long. Find the best deal you can get on balsa wood gliders taking into consideration cost of the glider plus shipping.
3,Fun Couple of Hours,"We definitely got good couple of hours of play with my 7 year old son. So, it definitely did the job for the price. However it was bit frustrating for him as it required constant adjusting of the wings after each throw. Also, if you haven't had the perfect launching angle or the wind condition, the plane didn't fly well."
2,Okay paranormal,"Although the writing style is good, the jumping back and forth between the present, short term past and long term past was very jarring. I also found the author crowded too many paranormal activities (not just a ghost, but remote viewing of the past) into the book, and it was confusing."
2,Remanufactured or used?,"I bought this and i can tell you it's almost like buying it from anyone on your neighborhood... the only difference, it comes with a box and new papers.... it is not remanufactured, it is used stuff....Does it works? yes, it does! but just like any other rice maker, it's just this is a stainless steel looking rice cooker which looks very good. there's nothing more that can be said.The product itself should be a 4 stars but being used instead of remanufactured.. it only gets 2.PP"
4,Cooker Works great,Works great and I figure I got my moneys worth on this item. Followed the directions exactly and my rice came out great. Have used as a steamer and am pleased with the results.Like some of the other reviews mine came in a tad bit dirty but a quick cleaning solved that also there were a couple of cosmetic scratches on the exterior but then this is a remanufactured unit.
1,Why couldn't Cuisinart at least clean it whilst refurbishing?,"The rice cooker arrived as promised in just two days good job Amazon. That is where the happiness ended, after opening the box I was astonished to find the cooker dirty and used. Is this how Cuisinart refurbishes their products? Scary I won't even plug it in. It is going to be returned."
3,"Okay, but nothing to write home about.","I am very disappointed in this rice cooker. Yes, it looks nice. The rice, however, is usually overcooked on the bottom. I also do not like that it has no ""off"" button. You have to unplug it. Kind of pricey for what it is. If mine were to stop working, I would buy a different rice cooker."
2,Very Overpriced,I found this exact item (same ounce size) locally for 1/4th the price and there are no pieces of the hull.
2,"Bad code, low on detail","Though I admittely have the previous print of this book, I am fairly convinced that my judgements of that book hold true for this edition. The C++ code presented here is some of the worst I have ever seen. The earlier chapters actually try to be a crashcourse C++. I got the distinct feeling in later chapters that the author's full knowledge of this wonderful language are unfortunately contained therein.The detail level of this book is saddeningly low. Being 112 pages (194 in my edition) this is hardly a surprise anymore.Long story short, if you want to see someone write bad but well documented code for a simple compiler, by all means buy this. If you want to know how things actually work, more books will be a necessity. My suggestion for theory: Dragon Book (Aho et al.) and add Holub's ""Compiler Design in C"" for a practical hands-on, but in-depth approach."
4,Great book for all sports fans,"This is one of the best sports books I have ever picked up. Very entertaining and great insight into a team dynamic and the relationships involved all the way from the coaches to the player to the trainers. I would highly recommend for any sports fan, not just NBA fans."
4,Good read,"If you like basketball, then you should enjoy this book. Even if you don't particularly like basketball, you'll probably enjoy the book. Some great insight into how an NBA team goes about its business. Includes some funny and amusing stories about the individuals involved, very enjoyable to read."
5,Amazing read into the inter-workings of an NBA team.,"Finished the book in 2 days, amazing read, and well written. You laugh at the pranks,and player banter, and you see the daily struggles of life within a bright spotlight. You see Nash crying at a long season of overcoming doubters and pouring everything into this team and still coming up short of the NBA finals. You see a team, that was always doubted in there skills, there ability and there desire, but rising to challenge after challenge.This book makes you feel apart of the team, and part of the inner circle and of a very special season. Jack McCallum is one of the best sports writers in my generation."
5,More entertaining than watching the Suns!,"I really enjoyed McCallum's cult hit ""Foul Lines,"" and this is the non-fiction equivalent. The author takes advantage of some unbelievable access to give real sense of the inner workings of a team - of a coaching staff, in particular. The writing is top notch as well. This is really on the short list of fine sports books."
4,Phoenix Suns,Jack McCallum had an insiders look at a season with the run and gun Phoenix Suns. Very well written and informative look at the behind the scenes action of a msuccesful NBA franchise.
3,Disappointing.,"Expected a lot more to be honest. There are better books by beat writers, such as ""If They Don't Win It's A Shame"" by Dave Rosenberg."
1,Don't Spend 7 Seconds on This!,"This is a pretty empty book -- much like the Suns offense. It is entertaining and fun to read, but does not really tell one much about the NBA or what it takes to win."
4,Great behind the scenes look!,I have enjoyed reading this book. It gives lots of great insight into the stresses of nba players and coaches. How they prepare for games and their perceptions of fans and media. You really see how almost all NBA players are prima-donnas with fairly fragile egos. They all have their front that they put on for the masses and the media. It's good to see the human side of them. The book is an easy read and very enjoyable.
5,A favorite,"I've underscored and starred so much of the copy in this book. Enriching, encouraging, thoughtfully written. A treasure in my library."
3,"A Mother's Heart A lookat Values, Vision and Character","I purchased this particular title for 3 of my granddaughters two of whom have a 6 month old and a year old. I do not know Miss Fleming, but I do know the organization that she has been associated with and they are a very trustworthy organization. The title caught my eye because these truths are what my grands want for their lives.The OK rating was not because of the content but rather their condition. As yhou wooked at the paperback pages with the book being unopened the white pages looked dirty or that they had been around for a very long time. This was disappointing to me, while $11.00 is not a great deal of money I did purchase four of them. It is my hope that the contends will supercede the appearance of the books."
1,Kindle book is full off typos,The content of this book is fabulous but there are so many typos on ever page of the kindle version it is difficult to read. Please fix it. I can't believe I paid $8 for this!! It looks like my 4 y/o typed it.
5,So well said!,"I appreciate the way that the author challenges me to view being a mom as such a high calling. I believe similarly, and would endorse everything the author says, now that I have six kids and see how neat it really is to be a MOM! Her views are based on the Bible, and it helps me to know that another mom has walked down this road before me, and can say in hindsight that God's ways are the best ways.If you can read only one book in your quest for improving yourself as a mom, I would highly recommend this as THE ONE! I had to reorder recently, as I kept loaning mine out to others and lost track of it -- buy a copy for a friend, or better yet, as a book-club-book. It will inspire some lively discussion and food-for-thought!"
4,A Great Foundational Book For The Christian Mom!,"This book gave me much to chew on and think about. It also had some great, practical ideas that I hope to implement with my children someday. Mrs. Fleming's book affirmed me in my role as a mother and this is one book I will read again and again."
4,A great way to introduce yourself to the game of go.,"This book steps through all of the basic strategy of Go. It is well illustrated and written in clear and understandable terms. I reference this book and the others in the series constantly.My only critque is that, as a series, the books tend to be a bit repetitive and do not delve much into more complicated strategy."
5,great book,"I don't like game stratagy books. I find things like chess problems boring and this type of book tends to kill my enjoyment of a game. But this book is a great way to learn go and this series really opens up your engagement with the game. The basic rules and stratagies are layed down using simple language and examples that are clear but also make you aware of the exciting potential of the game. If you are interested in learning go but don't know where to start, buy this book."
2,"Clear and Concise, but only for absolute newbies","The illustrations are great, and the book does a great job illustrating fundamentals. However, this book is for people who have played less than 5 games total.If you have played a few games with your friends, you've probably gone beyond the scope of this book."
3,"All Flash, no substance...or proofreading","I will post this to the first four books of the series, which I bought all at once.I was hoping this series, as popular as it seems to be, would be the Go equivalent of Yasser Seirawan's ""Play Winning Chess,"" but this series has nothing in comparison. I agree with other reviews that describe the books' lack of depth. There is actually so little information presented in the first four volumes, that they might as well be combined into one book for the same price as one of the books. There are also glaring typographical errors throughout every copy.Don't let the glossy covers fool you, in my opinion, this book series is nothing but a money grab. (I give the first and 2nd books 3 stars, because they are somewhat useful for absolute beginners, but still much too shallow to help in development)."
5,A great start,This book covers those questions you have concerning this game. Tells of useful techniques. This is a great way to get the hang of GO
1,Doesn't even meet tabloid journalism standards.,"The author collected materials from other biographies, and then added every sexual allegation he could find, from whatever the source. He even repeats stories which he must know are untrue. For example, the trooper who told the story of Clinton having sex on a surveillance camera recanted two years ago, but the story is printed as fact. Andersen seldom mentions problems with his sources' credibility. Too bad Clinton can't sue him."
1,"If you want TRASH for your cash, be sure to buy this book!",This book is clearly unsubstantiated trash. Written only to cash in like all the other Clinton bashing books that are so numerous at this time. Only someone who was already pre-disposed against the Clintons would find it easy to give this book 5 stars and recommend purchasing it!
3,Reads like a tabloid,"Think about this -- what if one-fourth of it is true! What a horrible example Hillary is setting for other women in this country. This guy is such a jerk and she's an even bigger one for staying with this guy. Actually, this book is pretty insightful. It is simply an example of power being the most important thing in two people's lives. What a waste of talent and education. Remember --- what if only one-fourth of it is true."
1,Buyer Beware,"Warning: IF you are offended by poor journalism, if you decry the use of invalid sources, if you don't like reading about trash, then stay away. Stay far away from Bill and Hillary: the Marriage. In fact move to Bulgaria, I understand it hasn't come out there yet. I don't mean to say that everyone should move to Bulgaria, its a small farmers country with not much to really offer, but the point is that it is Andersen-free. Free at last, free at last, Bulgaria is free of Andersen at last. I wish I had a biscut right now, boy am I hungry. Poor journalism makes me hungry."
4,"Don't pay full price wait till it has Odd'Lot's cheap, cheap","Well I have read it. I can't beleive some of the things Hillary didn't shave her legs, Bill was so busy he got the rabbits beat in that department, how did he find time was all of it on tax-payers money. We footed the bill but I wasn't invited to a sit down dinner to see the roving seduction look. Put it in outter space for the alien's to read, or a time capasule, I am sure the other worlds will probably not even come close to matching it a lot things happen behind all closed doors."
3,A great look at what really happens on the inside.,"This book was well written and easy to read. Although Bill and Hillary generally repulse me as liars and cons, for the first time I felt sympathy for Hillary. While it still greatly concerns me that she believes she is the real President and that she is so much ""smarter than the rest of us"", I at least got the impression that she was more honest than ""slick willie"". Had Bill not been such a goof-up, they could have made it to the top and become the first couple . . . . er . . .- whatever. My point is, this could have been a great presidency, but his true colors came shining through. This is a good read no matter what your politics."
1,Reader Beware! Salacious Rumormongering!,"This book is nothing more than a perverse harlequin romance. Mr. Anderson's sources are questionable at best. For example, his primary source to prove Hillary's alleged affair with Vince Foster is a former Arkansas State Trooper who was part of the the Troopergate article in the American Spectator.Save your money. There is nothing new here anyway and you're better off with reading more credible books on the Clinton's colorful life and times."
1,A little man writes a small-minded screed,"Anderson didn't so much write a book as he did toss a bucket of wild rumor into a blender and hit puree. Breathless allegations of ""truth!"" by Clinton-haters not withstanding, when you READ this ""book"" it's clear the most salacious rumor is just that -- unconfirmed, unsourced, sometimes unbelievable. I could write all kinds of fictions about people I dislike, too. It neither makes it true or right."
1,defending the indefensible,I saw the author on Larry King live and he could not defend the indefensible. Even he knew he had written tripe.
1,Not an authentic account of the Clinton's marriage,"Those who want to see in this book an authentic picture of the Clinton's marriage, will be disappointed. While this book gives some insight into the Washington presidential clique, it virtually runs down the President and Hillary. I rather buy me books that the President has read, because it shows me more about who he really is in the sense of his desires and personality. During his struggle last year, the President read Dietmar Scherf's ""I Love me: Avoiding & Overcoming Depression""--a great book, also available at Amazon."
5,Not Alot Thats New? Perhaps.... BUT...,"Contrary to what some have said here, this book is very well written. Perhaps, as some say, there is not alot that is new, but having it all compiled into one volume will be an eye-opener for most readers who may not have read some of these stories before. I found the information regarding the Hillary and Vince Foster love affair to be very well researched."
2,Lurid as expected...but is any of this REALLY news?,"What can one say?BC did what he does best...and ingratiated himself with the public. That he philandered is hardly a crime...and certainly not shocking given his past proclivities. That he did so...in the manner now know to all as the ""Lewinsky Affair""...only serves to highlight the gap between this man's rather substantial flaws...and his even more substantial gifts. Our country is unlikely to see such an individual again for a very long time; good thing, too.Unfortunately this book only serves to make the enemies of ""Bill & Hill"" more smug (with good cause, I admit...) while leaving the rest of us to scratch our heads about these two.Go figure..."
1,Why???,This book is a joke. It has no value to any reader. I thik that the Clinton's need to like do something about this. This is a book that has no soul behind it.
1,"Sorry, Too Late for the Coup Attempt!","This book is trash talk by and for sore losers with dirty minds.Somewhere along the line, some Republicans got it into their heads that the Presidency was theirs in perpetuity. This book is another example of their outrage at actually losing the White House, and in two consecutive elections at that.The well-funded Demonization of Bill and Hillary started in earnest in 1988, and continues to this late date. This particular literary pustule is just appalling, and so are the standards by which this mishmash of evil-minded fantasy was slapped together. Only those already consumed by hate will believe the poisonous tripe Mr. Andersen is trying to fob off on us. The few dozen remaining fans of Ken Starr will feel right at home in the sewer.Grownups, move on. There's nothing in this book for you."
4,Hearsay that is probably true.........sad and intriguing,"I expect this book isn't entirely true.....but it is plausible and probably closer to the entire truth than we Americans are comfortable with. Yes, it's discomforting to think that ""the most powerful man in the world"" could be so out of control; however, i can't be so naive to think that these things couldn't of happened. Let's be truthful folks........this is a totally engrossing book, whether you're shocked or saddened by it, or both!"
2,No depth beneath all the mud,"What purports to be a serious journalistic exercise is really an artwork of mud-wracking. If you're looking for juicy gossip, its here. But most of the charges are silly and unsubstantiated. Somebody says Bill Clinton has a sexual disease because he claims to have seen his medical records. Who is this person? How would he get his medical records? Is there anybody who can back this up? Spare me."
4,"Crisp writing, revealing facts and a page turner!","I bought this book hoping it would not be just another gossip-filled tome. It wasn't. It was basically a biography of Bill and of Hillary. And how their very different beginnings played a part in their present behaviors. Neither Bill nor Hillary are likable, caring people. They are two people on the same mission. To find Power. The writer is fair and even-handed. He brings out the full story on many rumors that pure politics have kept from the American people. I read it, my husband read it, and another couple is now reading it. Also have a waiting list of others who want to read it. It is a riveting book, well written and interesting."
1,Garbage for Sale. Don't buy it.,"This book is startling in the degree of petty, vitriolic garbage it contains. I have unfortunately seen first hand how reporters can put words in people's mouths and call it journalism. What's more, even if this book were an exact recounting of the truth, the point is, there is simply no need for the public to know what goes on in the President's bedroom. Every American is entitled to privacy, including the residents of the White House. Any one who reads this should feel a prickle of shame; if not, there is a Jerry Springer show that would surely make better use of your time."
5,Bill and Hillary are the greatest!,"If only Bill could run for a third term, I would surely vote for him again. It will be even better if Hillary soon becomes President and serves two terms as successful as his. They are two of the greatest Americans since Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda or Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Andersen's book inadvertantly but correctly shows how they had to put aside ethics and morals in order to lead this country to greatness as only real (left-wing) liberals can. Great people have always had to break the rules in order to achieve their worthwhile goals. It has repeatedly been shown that a strong central government is necessary for a country to run successfully, since the majority of people do not know what is best for them."
1,"Amazing, un-professionally written smut novel!","Even as a Republican whose stomach turns at the sight of Bill Clinton's face or the sound of his voice, I still found this collection of un-documented bachanalian anecdotes impossible to swallow.The text contains absolutely no citations. At the end of the book, the author provides a partial list of people he ""consulted"" while doing his research.Basically, all he did was take a sample of the most egregious stories from books such as ""All Too Human"" and ""Unlimited Access"" and weaves in with them a truckload of sordid second-hand rumors, and calls it ""an all-American love story.""The so-called author should face charges for character assasination. I don't doubt that some of the stories are true, nor am I casting the President as a victim of someone else's lies. The greatest victim in this story is Truth itself."
1,Not worth reading,"After reading this ""novel"", I was sorry I bought it. It's really depressing to think that these two are running the country."
1,Don't waste your time...,"Simply put, this book was published to make money regardless of any responsibility for it's content. It's totally unsubstantiated, and I was very dissatisfied (I got it as a gift). I'm not a huge supporter of Clinton from a personal ethics standpoint, but imagine what kind of president the author of this book would make ?? This is a very good example of that old credo..life isn't fair !"
2,Yellow Journalism,"There has never been a marriage more controversial in the American public eye than this dynamic duo. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have been rumored to have questionable personal lives since Bill was the Arkansas governor. While this has certainly been proven true, ""Bill and Hillary"" acts in the same fashion as ""Year of the Rat"" by Triplett and Timperlake in that it pulls all the punches and makes connections and assumptions that are iffy at best. While there is no doubt both Bill and Hillary Clinton have been proven to be not- so- faithful to their wedding vows, the idea that Bill engaged in cocaine use and street- side sex with a prostitute could not be based on anything more than hearsay. The accusations are certainly interesting, but much of them seem to be no more than sleazy yellow journalism."
1,Christopher Andersen writes a very negative unreliable book.,"I think we need to ask Christopher Andersen a lot of questions about his sources for the context of this book. I think when he wrote this he knew that many would believe anything negative written about Bill and Hillary. They've made mistakes but come on, only the right wing conservatives will believe all of this...because they WANT too."
5,Should be must reading for everyone who voted for B.C.,"An excellent, documented presentation of the truth. History will record the Clinton years as one of this countries darkest periods."
1,A Book about Nothing,"This book is about nothing - why do I say that? Because I cannot believe anything in the book because the author does such a poor job sourcing his information. I saw Lanny Davis tear him to shreds last night on live TV. My uncle, a hungarian cabinet maker, once told me that if the fish is smelly, then it is a smelly fish. I think that applies for this book, don't you. I mean who likes smelly fish, and who likes poor journalism? See what I mean. Ivan Duda - now there's a credible source! The guy gets his PI lisence revoked for waving a gun around a bar claiming to be a CIA agent. Oh boy! Clip-Job Chris has done it again!"
1,Was sent with a crack in it.,"Our 3 x 4' dry erase board arrived with a crack in the middle. The shipping box was perfectly fine, so it looks like it had this ding in the white smooth surface before they packaged it up and sent it to us. Thanks a lot!With all the complaints on Amazon about dry erase boards arriving damaged, why don't the providers spend a few extra cents and wrap it in bubble wrap or something?I first tried to get in touch with the seller, Advantage Gifts, but that doesn't seem possible. So, I'm going through the usual Amazon channels which would be terrific if they worked. Of course, they did not. I was never given the chance to print the return labels. Now I have UPS coming tomorrow and no shipping label. :(Help Amazon!!!"
1,Big Don Miller Fan -- media will not play,"I'm a big Don Miller fan and I am looking forward to doing this study with the Small Group I lead....not sure that's ever going to actually happen.I ordered media...arrived promptly....will not play (well, some of it plays, skips, sticks, etc.)...terrible and un-watchable. Tried this on 3 DVD players and our Blu-ray....nothing.Returned it and received another copy promptly....same thing. I'd advise nobody to order this media until the publisher fixes the problem...and it's already expensive....eaten the return postage twice.I think I'll stick with Don Miller books....they always work."
1,Didn't want to believe it,I didn't want to believe the earlier reviews that said this DVD was unwatchable. I have enjoyed Don Miller's books so much and this DVD sounded exactly like what I was looking for to get some non-threatening small group discussion going.Several sections would not play at all and the ones that did skipped or stuck. I am mailing it back and getting my money back.It really IS unplayable. What a shame!
3,Thought it was something different,"I had heard this explained as an open conversation with people on Christianity. I had thought this would include people who really didn't consider themselves Christian. After watching most of this, I found that just about everybody was not only a Christian but also a Pastor or someone who works at a Church.This reminds me of people giving testimonials. If that is what you are looking for you would probably give this a 5. If you thought it was a sampling of what different people thought about Christianity then at best you would give this a 3.As a sidenote many of the extras on my DVD got stuck in my sony DVD player. I would complain about it but I don't see myself watching this again so don't care a lot. I will chalk this up to a bad purchase. Usually I love Don Miller's books so I was really looking forward to a video."
4,Amazed and Dazzled from this NEW ARTIST,I bought this CD from a referral from a friend. They had seen Janine in concert on the East Coast. I was surprised. Usually I am really leary of new artists. BOY WAS I WRONG!!! There are a number of songs on this CD that are really great! I love Lifetime Guarentee------ Get Away-----Rhythm of My Heart---- Thank You-----As I Am------ They could be title tracks and actually POP/ROCK HITS---- I wish they would find there way to the airwaves. For a new artist I am amazed! She can belt out a song like Martina McBride and Celine Dion----Move over girls there's a new girl on the scene.JOB WELL DONE
5,Georgeous color,The color is quite pretty under food and garnishes show up nicely. This is a nice size for serving about anything for a smaller dinner party.
5,Best sound for the price,"I listened to multiple Ipod docks instore before deciding on this one. Though I could not find much info on the web about this particular brand, I chose it due to the overall sound quality and price. It sounds better than any other dock in the same price range. It has a good bass sound in a small package which is comparable to the Bose iPod dock but at a much lower price. It also has more features than the Bose with clock, sleep timer and FM receiver. Definitely recommended for a decent sound and price."
1,Do Not Buy TEAC,Purchased unit for Christmas LED is now unreadable. Called TEAC impossible to get a human on the phone. Sytem hangs up on you when all lines are busy. Called the recomended service centers. Both no longer service the product. Do not waste your money on this product.
3,Made into a DVD,"This is a show that was on NBC about 6 months to a year ago. It was nice to catch it on TV, but to make it into a movie of sorts, sounds kind of ridiculous to me."
5,Look! It's Dann Huff!!!!,"I like Faith Hill, but for me, one of the big thrills of watching the special was seeing Dann Huff and hearing him play Faith's songs. Dann Huff is an AMAZINGLY talented guitarist and producer (he produced both She-Daisy albums and several of Faith Hill's songs on her last two albums). Dann had a band back in the late 80s and early 90s, and has played on other musicians' albums (was so excited when I heard his guitar on a Lou Gramm album back in the 90s). Since the early 90s I hadn't heard much of him and had never seen him play (live or on tape), but now that he's working with some big names I was hoping to see him play and on this special I got to see him! He's well worth watching for those who don't know who he is. The title song here really shows how this man can PLAY. Check him out on the guitar solo!"
5,Fun from beginning to end,Its not a live concert DVD. Its a collection of live video footage from different events. Given that - I really enjoyed it.
5,A Hush Held My Throat - When I First Heard This Single,"I had never purchased anything by Faith Hill. But when I happened to 'accidentally' see her sing ""When The Lights Go Down"" on television a long while back - I literally had to remind myself to...breathe. It is perhaps one of the most perfectly composed, arranged, vocalized and powerful songs I have ever experienced in my life. If you can, try...and try hard to get this. You will never regret it - for this one song alone. Oh, and I did buy it after all. But it was worth every single penny and more."
5,Faith Fans Must Have,"I had seen this aired on a television special earlier this year and absolutely had to see it again. I have been looking for the version of ""Breathe"" with the one and only Carlos Santana. I thought it was amazing and was very excited to hear that it would be available on DVD. I recommend this to any Faith Hill Fan! Also the interviews with her and her everday life was very interesting. She is very talented, down-to-earth, and beautiful. Faith also performing ""Cry"" is exceptional and many of her new songs are worth watching over and over again."
2,Buy her music cd's instead!,"I found myself fast forwarding through most of the DVD. It falls short on music....a little to hollywood! Faith Hill is one of the attractive singers today, but I'd like less staged moves and glamour shots.....more music, please. I guess I'd like to see her in concert (song after song) rather then changing entire locations and scenes one after the next(comes across as a choppy video). I don't feel the DVD is worth the money....buy one of her cd's instead. She makes great music, not great DVD's."
5,FAITH HILL DVD,"After seeing this Thanksgiving special on NBC I was anticipating a DVD. Some of the highlights were very notable. ""Let Me Let Go"" was reformulated to have a Gospel feel to it and Faith sounded amazing singing it - it took me back to church! ""This Kiss"" was reworked to have a pop edge with new drum beats. ""One"" is a funky/bluesy song that Faith nailed. Included on the DVD that did not origianlly air were two songs: ""Stronger,"" which is my favorite song of her album Cry, was just beautiful and ""Back to You"" rocked the house. But the lasting impression from the DVD is Faith's duet with Carlos Santana. They collaberated on her smash-hit ""Breathe"" which was the best performance of this song that I have heard her sing. With no music to over-shadow her voice, it was just Faith, Carlos and a band of guitars....WOW!I recommend this DVD to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,slow starter but a good read,"Jessica Stanbridge sets out for Colorado with her companion Myra. Her mission is to find saurian bones for the museum that she works at. She hires a guide, Rory Burnett. His mission is to keep her away from the sacred ground of the Ute Indians. These two are not on friendly terms but there is an underlying current of attraction running between them. Who will have their mission end in success? Or will both be successful in love?Past Promises is a good read. It does start out a little slow. In fact I had to start this book two different times and was about to give up when it began to get interesting. The characters were likable and well-developed. The storyline was OK, except I wasn't very interested in the whole paleontology part of the book.Past Promises ia a book worth reading after you get past the first fifty or so pages. Don't give up because this is a very good read woth the time."
1,...,"I just couldn't finish this. Jessica was a rude female lead, and close-minded. The book moved way too slow and was so boring I couldn't stand it. I didn't care about anything that was happening in the story. Don't waste your time with this Landis book."
2,"Gutsy subject matter, but needs some polish","It may seem kind of irrelevant for someone to write about America staring down the silo of nuclear annihilation, but Teretha G. Houston reminds us that the threat still exists...The book gets high marks for its readibility (it took my about six hours altogether to get through it), the thoroughly plausible premise, and the strength of its main characters (Leggett, his wife Denise, and his best friend Manchester)...The book does suffer, though, from some bad copy editing (several typos and misspellings in the text), some flat supporting characters, and some glaring technical faults...In technical fiction, it's the attention to detail (or lack thereof) that can make or break the story...Hopefully, Ms. Houston's next work will have some more polish and accuracy behind it...But Armageddon at Defcon 1 is worth spending a quiet afternoon with..."
2,The concept? Great. The book? Bleh.,"Like I said, the plot in its simplest form was a good idea, but it was implemented pretty poorly. Armageddon at Defcon 1 may be an OK read for people who don't demand thoughtful and refined writing. This novel would have been more interesting had it been written by Tom Clancy. Armageddon at Defcon 1 would have made a good movie, or an even better comic book."
2,A great idea with poor technical development,"Reading the previous reviews for this book overcame my initial reservations at paying full price for this book. To my disappointment, the reviews did not accurately portray this books worth. While I found that the idea behind the story is a good one, I found the level of technical development lacking. While not everyone writes to the level of detail that Tom Clancy has made famous, authors writing in this arena should at least strive to research their subject matter and provide at least some technical background. I understand this is a work of fiction. I cannot understand however the use of terms such as ""The President of the CIA"". This is just one of many silly statements found in the book that could have been better portrayed. Was this book edited before it went to print?? I believe a good editor could have caught many of the writing problems in this book. Overall, I think it was a story with great potential that was sold short by a lack of development."
4,America's Songs,"An entertaining overview of American popular music. The authors have compiled a small encyclopedia about the subject, creating their version of The Great American Songbook. Recommended."
4,Dating for Christians,"This book was seemingly written as a rebuttal to ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" by Joshua Harris. The difference between the two is easy to spot: Harris was 19 when he decided to give up dating, and Clark is 26. Obviously, from a Christian perspective, a 26-year-old man has a much better chance of supporting a family than a 19-year-old man does. Both men are pastors at their respective churches and their advice is scriptural. Clark uses his own real-life experience of dating and then marrying his wife, Jerusha, as well as sound biblical counsel and examples."
1,A Book Writen With Bad Intentions,"Mr. Clark wrote his book with bad intentions. As he states he wrote his book because too many people were opting for non-dating route. While other books were written out of love and concern for the readers well being and spiritual walk, Mr. Clark's book was only interested in defending his point and putting an end to a legalistic view of dating and living. As a good friend once said, ""Too many people are worried about being legalistic and not worried enough about sin. I choose to kiss Mr. Clark's book goodbye."
5,By Far the Best!,"I just finished reading ""I Gave Dating A Chance"" and I would recommend it to anyone searching for the right way to date. I have been in a few serious relationships that have ended in heartache. I do not agree with the idea of courtship, but I was beginning to wonder if it was the only way to protect myself from becoming hurt once again. I have read numerous books on dating and this one is by far the best. It has challenged me to re-think my approach to dating so that I can puruse godly relationships. Give this book a try- you won't be disapointed!"
3,differing perspectives,"Jeramy Clark's book on dating, though intending to be an alternative to Joshua Harris' book on ""courtship"", in many ways is no different. Clark and Harris say many of the same things regarding relationships. For much of the book the differences are merely semantic. Of the two books I would have to say that Harris' book is the more realistic when it comes to evaluating the emotional baggage and over-dependence for most, if not all, of us. Harris sees the weakness and self-centeredness of most relationships and seeks to safeguard us against it. Clark, though relying on the Holy Spirit to help us, seems to trust too much on our own strength in this issue, including an over-realized eschatology - we still war against the flesh (Romans 7)."
2,Kinda pathetic,"I didn't read the whole book because I was so turned off. It's obviously just a slap at Josh Harris' book, and kinda unnecessary. Dating itself is not a sin, as Josh Harris says--but the attitudes sure can be! This book is just a way to excuse sinful behavior, and perhaps soothe ruffled feathers. Let's think of what is BEST for our lives, not just okay. Is dating God's best?"
3,"good as balance, but with some issues...","This book, on the whole, wasn't too bad. It is good to read to balance out the anti-dating/pro-courtship point-of-view. However, I was a bit disturbed with the chapter that fielded questions, in particular the answer to the question which basically went ""what if I never get asked out?"" for many ppl, especially many women and girls, there are a lot of issues (self-image, oppression, etc.) tied into such a concern, and it would have been better if the author didn't address this concern in such a trite way. A better book to recommend is ""Choosing God's Best"" by Don Raunikar. That book didn't completely condemn dating, but did criticize dating the world's way."
5,"An excellent, well thought out response!","I teach at a Christian middle school and have a teenage daughter who is interested in beginning dating. Several people had recommended ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"", but after thumbing through it at my local book store I decided it was too hard line for me. I picked up this book and was immediately impressed by it's blurb on the back. Having now read it, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is uncomfortable with only one answer to the dating question for Christian teens. Jeramy Clark presents a biblical framework that is balanced and reasonable for our time. A must read for Christian teens and parents!!"
4,A Good Perspective,"As someone who was previously a part of the ""wait - never date!"" group, this book was an excellent help when I did, in fact, start a ""dating"" relationship. While he does address some of the ideas put forth by Josh Harris, he does so in an honest and acceptable manner. I'd probably recommend this book over Harris', but if someone is looking for a slightly different take on relationships, Boy Meets Girl is a good read."
3,Not terribly original,"All the information in this book was accurate, but not outstanding. The author makes very obvious statements that we want to remain pure for God through our dating life, but he does't give any specific tips on how to do this. The book could still be helpful for someone who has never really thought about having a dating relationship in a Christian manner, but I was hoping for more practical applications on dealing with the pressures of dating that realistically will occur."
4,Inside Out- Great Read,"I loved this book very much. It dealt with difficult subjects like autism, but in a 12 year old way. It was a very emotional book, and it showed Ann Martin can write things other than Baby Sitter's Club books well. =0) I reccomend this book for all children."
5,cool!,"Jonno just wants to be part of the in-crowd, but it's impossible because of his brother who's different."
3,not effective,I purchased this humidifier because it was easier to clean and had germ protection. It is easy to clean but after using it for a full winter I haven't noticed an increase in humidity in our bedroom. I thought it would help with the dryness and to reduce nose bleeds but I've found no difference in the humidity between having it on or off.
4,Excellent results,"This humidifier succeeded in its goal of easing eye irritants and weezing. It is dramatically noticeable when we forget to refill the unit and that is the main reason 4 stars - It empties sooner than anticipated. Also of note, the soft gurgling noises are less intrusive than anticipated."
5,the only desktop humidifier worth spending less than 500$ on,"works and keeps on working. nothing to clean besides the tanks. don't waste your money on the ""giant sponge"" style humidifiers. the GF-220 is truly the only humidifier worth spending less than $500 on"
4,Think it's a nice humidifer,"Overall, I have been satisfied with this humidifier. I don't mind the bubbling sound at all, and although it must be cleaned daily, it cleans up a lot better than previous humidifiers I bought at Walgreens. The germ-free feature is great since I have allergies, and it has a real nice sleek and sturdy design. I really like the fact that it will run 24 hours before it needs another fill up. The filters are effective in reducing the amount of build-up during operation, although they can't prevent it entirely. The only drawback is that I wish it produced a little more humidity, but there are many positives for this humidifier."
2,Is it even on?,"I did a good bit a research on humidifiers and the Slant Fin seemed to have it all -- large capacity, little noise, and the UV light. And, as advertised, it has delivered on all those fronts. The only problem is that the output is so weak that it has a minimal effect on the humidity in a very small room. After running it for several hours, it could only get the RH in my room up from 30-32 to 35-36 percent. I could probably do the same with spray bottle. When I hold my hand over a humidifier, I want *some* water to condense on it.Maybe it's just mine, but I couldn't in good faith recommend this to anyone else."
2,Shipps fails to address controversial aspects of LDS church,I found this book to be a generally accurate account of Mormonism by a non-mormon apologist. It's very disappointing that the author did not address adequately any of the many controversial aspects of the historical or present-day LDS church.
4,She couldn't have told it better.,"Faye's memoir is a fascinating read. I must admit I devour anything Holocaust related, but a book on the Partisans was just too fabulous to miss. The book isn't prettied or stylishly fabulous. You can tell Faye never studied how to properly write a book, and the segways, if present, are insufficient BUT she did catch my interest and more than any of that, I cared about Faye and cared about what happened to her. Isn't that the true test of fine writing? It's an honest, heart ripping account of what happened to her and what it felt like to live through the holocaust and beyond. Bravo!"
1,Flawed memoir has anachronisms and lacks credibility,"An interesting memoir, but has a serious problem. The author mentions that her Soviet Partisan unit was subjected to a German helicopter attack in 1944. The Germans did not have any helicopters in WWII, and neither did any other country. They did have ground attack airplanes, but the book describes a helicopter attack. There is either a credibility problem with this account, or some type of translation/linguistic error. The publisher should have caught this."
3,couldnt get into it,"The premise seems interesting and the first chapter is certainly gripping. However I'm not able to trudge through the laboriously described landscape and meals. based on other reviews it seems others are ok with this, clearly it is a personal preference. It could be I'm still suffering a Dance With Dragons PTSD, but I dont want oddly arranged 'quaint' sentence structure and every rock on the road discussed. I dont think I'll be able to finish it."
4,A Good Storyteller,"This author has the gift of writing stories--good, taut stories. This book is fun to read, though not as riveting as the books she wrote as Robin Hobb--I believe the ones she wrote as Megan Lindholm are the earlier works? Good serviceable prose, and well imagined and conceived settings. Familiar themes, but new stories--pleasant, engaging book. Not Shakespeare perhaps, but neither has she the slightest aspiration that way. She sets out to entertain, and she succeeds."
5,Beautiful Scenes,"The plot was limited, and the conclusion obtuse, but the beautiful scenes were a pleasure to read. I've read some of Robin Hobb's other works, which are also wonderful, and I can see her apprenticeship in this novel."
1,Freedom Spot On for Dogs,This stuff works for a week and then watch out!!!!! Your dog will have flea's and tick really bad.
3,Really worn...,"Was hoping for a little bit cleaner and not so faded copy. There are not as many beautiful pictures ofher flower art,as the other book I have."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I had a round dish and had to cut the sticks of butter in half to fit...messy! This dish is perfect. Heavy thick glass, easy to grip and does not slip from my hands, holds two sticks of butter nicely. No complaints from me!!"
4,Almost Perfect,"This butter dish is almost exactly what I was looking for ... a container large enough to hold a stick of butter PLUS the butter knife! The short butter knife sticks out the edge a bit, but much better than anything I've found so far! I use mine upside down (like the photo) with what's supposed to be the base on top and the large lid on the bottom to hold the butter and the knife. I haven't given up hope finding the PERFECT butter dish, but in the mean time, this works just fine."
3,BIBLICAL MESSAGES!,him goes from his infernal majesty to singing songs like kurt franklin!go to www.dogpile.com and look up song meanings and a website for that will lead you to the dark truth!
3,This is beautiful music.,"This is one of the most elegantly written and crafted albums I've ever heard. Simple, atmospheric guitar arpeggios provide a dream-like backdrop for Jeffrey Running's earnestly passionate vocals and lyrics in song after song, each reveling in its own beauty, building and deepening into shimmering bliss. This is the kind of music you can sink into and let take you away. There just isn't enough music like this, and I find this album a good friend every time I return."
4,A critical book...a must read for every dog owner,It is an excellent book on the subject of training your dog. It is actually a must read for any serious dog owner
2,Difficult to read,"Colonel Most's book presents a lot of information, valuable and pertinent in part even 100 years after its publication. The convoluted, verbose presentation, however, challenges even a reader with the patience of an angel, the leisure time of a retiree, and the education of a college professor. The average dog trainer might find more helpful a recently (2012) published textbook by Schellenberg (ISBN 9780960879823)."
3,DOG TRAINING MANUAL BY KONRAD MOST,"While I liked this book from a very brief review, it didn't meet my specifications for my eleven year old grandson and his family. It was very well done, but I do believe there should have been a qualifying comment regarding the age of a person to use this book to train a dog. It is not even plausible that a youngster can use this book. It is more of a book for either a military type person and/or a trainer involved in the area of police work and/or investigation. That is why I had to return the book.Thanks and have both a blessed day and a very safe and happy New Year."
4,Swingline hole punch,The product was received in a timely manner. It was purchased for a faculty member and I have heard no complaints. It is performing well.
3,NOT for beginners.,"I bought this book in hopes it would help me learn how to play the ukulele - but it wasn't. If this is your first time learning how to play an instrument - go with something else. It looked like a fun book, if I could understand it!"
2,so-so arrangements with shoddy binding and missing songs,"These are very basic ""lead-line"" arrangements with just the melody and chord frames. There are no suggested accompaniments, no strum patterns, and no TAB. A player will need some experience or imagination to use this book.Worst of all, the copy I received was improperly collated at the print shop and goes from pages 1-24 to pages 13-24 to pages 49-60 to pages 49-72. Pages 25-48 are missing.Caveat emptor; there's a batch of improperly bound copies of this book out there and it will be the luck of the draw if your copy contains some of your favorite songs or not."
3,"Not as good as Ukulele Country, but not bad","I think my title summed up my feelings. I bought this to work out songs on my Fluke, but found these more difficult to play then Jumpin' Jim's Ukulele Country. If your just starting out, go with Ukulele Country instead."
4,Good compilation of songs but would be great if a CD comes with it.,"This is a fantastic compilation of most of the popular songs in the 60s.Too bad it doesn't come with a CD.As a beginner, I aren't quite sure how to make out the strumming pattern by looking at the charts.But it's excellent if you are a better ukulele player."
4,"fun songs and easy to learn, play","I like this song book. I like most of the songs in it and find them easy to play and sing along with since I am familiar with those songs. If you like this sort of music and play the Uke, you might enjoy this book too."
4,A glorious celebration of Christmas!,This book is not only creative -- it is beatiful and spiritual! I was so moved by it and was in love with the illustrations. It is a delightful Christmas gift! For the organized.. It is a smashing gift! I will buy it for all the children I know from my church!
3,looks dull,"I purchased 16plates to take the advantage of 4 for 3 promotion and there was a coupon for 25 off 125... But once they arrived, I was disappointed... they are heavy and look dull. I returned them for a full refund...thanks to Amazon's customer support"
2,very dry,"while at times july loses his preachy ""lessons of Africa as lessons of the world"" lecture mode, mostly the book is dry preexisting generalizations about the continent. he fails to preempt the possibility that whoever may be reading his book has some basic knowledge of Africa and African History. You may find some of his insights helpful if you are the type person who refers to africa as the 'black continent.' Evem if this is required for a class, don't buy. your prof. couldn't concievably test you over the words of this quack."
1,What a disappointment!,"We love all Angelina Ballerina DVDs. However, this one is a big disappointment. There is very very little original content and most of the ""movie"" is pieced together from other episodes of Angelina Ballarina. If you haven't seen any of other episodes, you may still find this one interesting. We were so disappointed to see repeat of many many things kludged together and sometimes, they don't even make sense! Again, we love all Angelina Ballerina episodes, but this one turned out to be a bust."
4,Finally!,"Cook n' Jones were the real talent in The Pistols. They did ""Silly Thing"" from 'the ...Swindle'. And if you have the Pistols Pack (box of 7""'s) or the Japanese 'Best Of' there's another one called ""Black Leather"". Anyways, this album will not disapoint. It's just great rock n roll. And with 8 bonus tracks ...you can appreciate what a great band this was. Join The Professionals & 1-2-3 were only available as hard to find singles. Now there is a b-side instrumental ""Action Man"" missing but tracks 12 + 14 are new to me so I'll quit complaining. ...."
4,More of a new wave album than the first disc.,"I Didn't See it Coming (1981) was a re-recording of the first album that was shelved due to legal issues. Steve Jones and Paul Cook found some new bandmates and relaunched the Professionals. Instead of sounding like The Sex Pistols they looked and acted more like Duran Duran.Some of the tracks were from the first (and better) album. But this disc has some great songs (The Magnificent and Payola) the re-recorded tracks are okay. What makes this disc a keeper is the extra tracks, You get the singles and some outakes from the first album!Too bad the band fell apart due to ego and drug problems (mainly drug abuse). They could have been a force to reckon with in the eighties. Steve Jones would later kick his horse habit and embrace 'heavy metal"" bands such as Motley Crue and Guns N' Roses. For shame!Highly recommended."
5,Hard to find,Take This Job and Shove ItBarbara Hershey doesn't disappoint. Classic working man's movie. Had trouble finding it until I looked on Amazon.
3,Great Movie,NOTE**** - Does not make a good Christmas gift for your boss. Don't find out the hard way!
3,Pretty Good movie,This Movie is good one to watch-Good Actors played in this movie I remember this back in the Early 80's aired on one's movie channels on cable.
4,For Die Hard Rich Fans,"I may not be a professional critic, but I know this much, if you're a real Charlie Rich fan you will enjoy this film. He may not have much reel time in this, but what he does have is worth the price of the film. Although he isn't seated behind his piano in this flick, he is given a chance at some good old fashioned slap-stick, and breaks up in the middle of one scene that has him being blasted by two huge water hoses. As for the rest of the film, if you like The Dukes of Hazzard, you'll love this. I don't, but I love Charlie Rich, so I was happy."
1,The difference between Truth and Lies,"In an era where our teachers and ministers alike are striving ever harder to imbue our children with a sense of the beauty of cultural diversity and concord among the peoples of the world, Ridenour's contribution to religious literature is shameful and backward. If one is to follow Ridenour's logic, being a good Christian means affirming that ""our"" God is not ""their"" God, that modern science is dubious, and that a layman's survey of the bible is sufficient preparation for spiritual independence. Ignoring modern critical scholarship of the bible (but emphasizing inconsistencies in non-Christian texts), ""So What's The Difference"" teaches that religious exploration is for clever people like Ridenour but not for those who really want to reflect on the nature of God, salvation and religious observance. That this book should be on any bookshelf is a tragedy."
1,"Biased, innacurate, and condescending",The author seems to think that he can pass judgement any way he pleases without even offering accurate information. Avoid this one.
3,Contains Helpful Charts,"This book is very short, and because of its length it really isn't able to go into depth on any one of the religions discussed. It does cover a lot of territory though, and if you're just looking for a good overview of the main differences between Evangelical Christianity and other religions, then this book is really helpful. Especially helpful are the charts included for each religion which lay out the main things the religion believes about Jesus, the resurrection, salvation, etc. It covers many of the ways other religions intersect or blatantly disagree with Evangelical Christianity, but it leaves out everything about the religions that do not have something to do with their relation to Evangelicalism. So this book is definitely helpful to gain a little bit of knowledge on a wide range, but much more research would be required in order to be able to have a full understanding of the main world religions."
5,What's the Difference,"After reading this book, I ordered more copies to give to friends.This book should be in every home. As usual the service from Amazon was Fast and Courteous. GGSKIDS"
1,Did he even look for sources?,If you are looking for a 'non-judgemental' and factual book this is not the book for you. Most if not all of the 'facts' are either 50 years out of date or completly made up. It pretends to give a non biased overview of several major religious faiths and instead is a poorly concealed attempt at pressing a very narrow point of view.
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I gave this book a rating of one star because zero was not offered as a choice. This author clearly has an evangelical Christian agenda. I thought I was getting a book to help me better understand the world's major faith systems. What I read was a narrow-minded fundamentalist's attack on any and all religions or denominations not closely aligned with his own. A better subtitle would have included the phrase: ""...and how you will go to hell if you don't believe as I do"". Any reader seeking facts and an unbiased, objective treatment of this subject would do better with ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to the World's Religions""."
5,So What's the Difference?,"This book is concise enough for the average reader to hold interest, yet contains enough facts and links to related articles, that it will fill the more avid reader's appetite for solid evidence and thorough knowledge to be trustworthy and useful for instruction."
5,Still relevant,"Although this book was originally published in the 1970s, the content is still relevant for today. The author does a great job breaking down into layman's terms what each religion believes and where they came from. Excellent resource for a Sunday school class or lifegroup."
4,book review,this is an excellent book dealing with the various religious beliefs most of us will encounter.
4,So What's the Difference,The author draws on information from the Bible to set forth the main tenets of Christianity and then uses them as plumb lines to judge 20 different worldviews. The writing is simple and easy to understand and adaptable to a group setting. We are using it in Sunday School class and our folks are enjoying and being edified. I recommend it!
4,So What's the Difference,"For someone who wants to know about the major religions of the world and how they differ according to the Christian perspective, this is a good reference book; however, it is strictly Christian. In other words, the author says that Christianity is the only true religion and all others are wrong. It is not an unbiased book."
3,So What's The Difference,"I bought this book as a gift for my husband, but it has sat on the shelf. He would like to read it, but has not yet."
3,So that's the difference...,Ridenour probably wouldn't sit next to me in church but he has compiled a good elementary look into other religions. I don't know that I agreed with his classification of cults versus religion so maybe he should do away with the distinction in the book.Overall I got what I was looking for but this is certainly not an unbiased look at all religions.
1,The Biblical Evangelical View,"This books starts off by describing a Biblical Evangelical world view, and gives all the reasons that one should embrace that world view. It then compares major religious groups to that view, and criticises them based on the differences.It makes no attempt to give a balanced perspective of other world religions or even other denominations. This is definately not a book for a thinking person. Perhaps an Evangelical who is looking for assurance this he has the ""right"" perspective would enjoy it.As for me, I threw it out."
5,Informative,This book is well written and easy to read. Informative and very helpful in understanding the difference.
5,Used For My Critical Thinking Class at NYU,"This is truly an amazing book.In my opinion, it doesn't matter if you need this as a required text for a class or just something to read on the side...Even though I had always considered myself a ""Strong"" critical thinker - this book truly blew the doors of my mind off of its hinges and showed me, indeed, how to ""Ask the Right Questions""."
5,An essential tool for daily living,"Every day each of us is faced with a myriad of decisions, some big, some small. Learning to successfully navigate the waters of decision making does not come naturally; rather, it requires important tools. Asking the Right Questions provides such tools. Whether I am reading a book, watching the news, or simply interacting with others, I am constantly using the skills taught in this book to evaluate other's arguments, to form my own opinions, to construct my own arguments, and to better understand the world around me. In fact, I cannot think of a single aspect of my life where the skills taught herein are not invaluable. One of the strengths of the book is that it is interactive. Not only does the book teach you to think and read actively, but the authors demand such engagement as you go along. I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to possess essential tools for evaluating all the information we are bombarded with daily. It's a great book."
2,"ok board, frame too fragile",The frame was broken on arrival. Poor construction. Otherwise a typical melamine board.
3,Annie is a Vitamin C clone,"Her music is catchy, yes but after a run, I've had enough of it. I loved Heartbeat though. Chewing Gum was horrible. The other songs are so-so...She reminded me of Vitamin C."
5,This is a good dance pop music!!!!,"Before I didn't know this girl singer but I'm amazed from her voice...it's sweet and fantastic!!! Any songs to remind Kylie Minogue or Britney Spears...my favourite are: Chewing Gum, Always Too Late, Me Plus One, Heartbeat, Helaless Fool For Love!!! This is a good dance pop music!!!"
5,Awesome!,"I love this CD. It's one incredible piece of sweet, sweet Electropop!Why isn't this woman on the top of the charts yet? Or at least the dance charts?Buy this CD and support Annie!"
3,YOUR GUILTY PLEASURE!,"I bought this album largely based on reading good reviews, not having heard a single song from Annie... and let me tell you, her infectious form of 80's inspired sugary electro-dance-pop delivers the goods. Anyone who samples Madonna's 'Everbody' and puts her own unique take on it gets a A in my book. The only qualms I have are that her confectionary sweet vocals can feel a little nauseating at times- kinda like if you sat down to eat a few chocolates, and end up scarfing the whole box.The comparisions to Kylie Minogue and Madonna will be inevitable; although she's no vocal giant, she makes up for it with awesome pop hooks that will have you bopping around your living room."
1,Learn From My Mistakes,"So bad. So So So bad. I can only think of one or two scenes in this movie that were ok, but one or two scenes does not a movie make. Terrible acting, bad makeup, terrible acting, stupid story, terrible acting, cheesy effects, and terrible acting. Oh, and the acting was terrible. A waste of time, money and resources. Watching paint dry is more entertaining then this."
2,"Okay, I guess.","Raiders is a cheesy, hoaky, run of the mill forgotten horror film. Funny at moments with one head exploding scene (the most gore you'll get with this film), Raiders is descent, but not great by any means.A good thing to have in my collection, but would I watch it again...may be awhile--if never....The other DVD's are screwed up versions of the first film, not worth viewing really. Brett Piper's version is incomplete and crap, don't buy it for his version.You've been warned, bad movie, good collector's item."
5,Please listen.,"Every body should read this book! It contains so much truth about our behavior that you'll be surprised, and not only that. It will show you how you can help yourself. It can only do you good by reading it. If you don't, all you do is miss out."
1,Desiring God,"I recently received the book ""Desiring God"" by John Piper from WaterBrook Multnomah for review.I had heard good things about John Piper and this was the first of his writings that I had received. Despite being excited about reading the book, I found myself frustrated.This book was very difficult to get into. I felt that it was very wordy. Piper could have said many things in a fraction of the words. I felt like I had to read three to four pages in order to understand an idea that shouldn't have exceeded a paragraph.This book had a lot of good things in it, it just takes a long time to get the meat out of it. I would not recommend this book to someone who is looking for a quick and easy read. This would be a good book for a church or ministry leader who doesn't mind a lot of ""fluff"" to go along with the ideas presented."
3,3 and 1/2 really...,There are blothces of really inspiring and sound information bits here. There are blothches of poor info as well. The good info's wonderful.
2,Important topic but poorly written,"It's a topic that needs to be addressed, and I appreciate the author's research and effort, but the writing is overflowing with redundant statements and double negatives that made the book unreadable. I couldn't finish it."
2,Did-Not-Finish,"I just could not get through this book! It was provided to me free from the publisher for review, so I really tried to get through it. This was my first time reading something by John Piper and I really thought it would be interesting. But I found it dry and boring. The footnotes were distracting and I just wasn't getting where he was going with the material. I found myself not wanting to pick it up to read it but feeling obligated to since it was given to me for review. Finally I just decided life is too short and there are too many other books out there for me to read to waste my time with one that just wasn't grabbing my attention. I am putting it back on the shelf to maybe give it a try at a future date. There is just no desire to read it right now (pardon the pun :-)."
4,"Enjoying God Brings Him Glory and Me, Joy","I so enjoyed this book. I've never read anything by John Piper, so this was a treat. I had to read it slowly so that I could truly understand and think through what he said.The basic idea that I took away from Desiring God, is that we give Him glory by enjoying Him. Just as I feel honored and loved when my adult children enjoy me and my presence, so God is honored and loved when I enjoy Him.He is everything that I truly crave in life: perfection, beauty, order, joy, love, and peace. All of the things I long for in my earthly life and heart are found in perfection in Him alone.I will be rereading portions of this book through the months so that I can be often reminded of where my joy truly lies."
4,The book is fine. The seller was disappointing,"The book is thought provoking. It proposes some perspectives that a number of people would consider outside the traditional Christian understanding of why we should and do praise God. The premise being that our happiness/joy and our praise/glorification of God are inextricably intertwined and are mutually self reinforcing.So, of the book I would say that I like it so far but have not yet read enough to recommend to others.Re the seller, I was disappointed significantly by the nearly one month delivery time."
4,A True Joy---But A Note of Caution,"Many Christians will find Piper's thoughts about what he calls Christian Hedonism refreshing. Piper cites the Westminster Confession, ""the chief end of man is to glorify man and to enjoy him forever"", and fills the idea of ""enjoy him"" with powerful and Biblically anchored practical suggestions. This book will really help you want God more, and give practical ways to invoke many scriptural principles. But it is clear that God himself is the end...not the benefits of joy in themselves. My note of caution is for those of us who are not Calvinists. Piper is a very strong and very consistent Calvinist. You'll have to disentangle ""the good stuff"" from that system.....or let him convert you to Calvin! I'd not give this book to someone unprepared to read those portions critically. That said, the careful Christian reader will be blessed by this wonderful work, and by almost anything Mr. Piper writes."
5,Most Spiritually Challenging Book You Will Ever Read!,Dr. Piper lays the truth of the gospel out on the table in a way that is both accurate and convicting. His sweeping statements about the nature and characteristics of God demand a response from the reader. The response is worshipping God. Dr. Piper hits you where you need to be hit: our pride. He challenges us to be humble and respectful to God while realizing that the only way to glorify Him is to have our thoughts completely immersed in Him. I would recommend this volume without reservation. You will be challeged and stretched to think differently about worship and God. Excellent work.
3,Desiring God,"Desiring GodWhenever I walk through Barnes and Noble, I am amazed at how many books are published that shouldn't be. Honestly, where did these publishers find the authors putting out some material? There are relatively few books that should be published, and fewer that should be republished.Desiring God is a book that was transformational when released in the 80's, and still finds itself as a foundational book today, in 2011, as it is released in it's revised edition, 25 years later. A book that clearly shows the joy that is found in fully engaging oneself into the Christian faith.If you are looking for a light, easy read...perhaps one that can be used as a bathroom reader or coffee table décor, it is not this book! John Piper is a theologian, and writes as such. This book requires a pen to underline good points, time to think through revealed principles, and coffee to keep your attention.[...]"
3,Desiring God - good for new christians,"In ""Desiring God"" Piper shows us that as Christians it isn't just `ok' to be happy, it is our duty. That to seek pleasure in God actually glorifies Him. Piper uses plenty of scriptures to support his claims, and not all of them are taken out of context.If you are looking for a book that explains why you should be happy and full of joy as a Christian, then this is for you. If you already know that you are supposed to desire God, then you will want to find something with more depth.All in all, not a bad read, good for the new Christian, but I won't be reading it a second time nor will I be putting it in my top 100.FTC Disclaimer "" I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review"""
4,Don't be so religious,I think the critics of this book are taking the subject to an extreme. Just eat what is important to you and spit out the bones. There are multiple nuggets of information throughout the book.
1,Which came first the chicken or the egg?,"Simple question which you must answer your self in reading this book. Do we ""...glorify God by enjoying Him forever"" or do we gloify a dynamic living God, who ""credits us with righteousness"" when we serve, worship, sing, and praise Him?The answer to which came first the chicken or the egg? God came first, God is first, and we must know and understand our place!""He must increase, but I must decrease,"" John 3:30"
1,WORDS OF MEN - NOT THAT FANTASTIC,"What we need is more Scripture, less personality cults and books about the Book. I have to question if God's own Word was up for review, how many of us would jump to give it a 5-star rating and be as passionate about it...."
1,"Book tells wives to be submissive to husbands and to avoid a ""cocky"" attitude","Piper's book was shallow, repetitive, and not useful. He also has a painfully bad writing style that was tiring to wade through. He advocates disturbing things like wives always being submissive to their husbands. He warns wives not to be ""cocky"" in their behavior to their husbands. Repellent, ugly stuff."
4,"Piper's Desiring God, Not For Me","Desiring GodI don't want to sound like Desiring God is not a good book, but I don't agree with John Piper's view on how to go about Desiring God. Not being a Calvinist, probably makes me the worst person to review this book, so I will be fair. If you are a Calvinist this book is probably more on your line of thinking. If you are a Calvinist this book is probably more on your line of thinking. If you are not a Calvinist this book is probably not for you.I refuse to argue theology because a review is not the place. I gave the book 4 stars because, if you agree with him then I think you should read this book."
2,Desiring God needed an editor,"Piper has a good point about taking joy in God, His goodness, and our salvation. The concept isn't new (see the Westminster Confession) but is well worth remembering. We are supposed to enjoy being christians and to take joy in what God likes.The problem with Desiring God is that it is not well written. There are several problems. First, Piper seems to have transcribed sermons and turned them into chapters. This never reads well. Second, there are many awkward similies/illustrations that distract rather than illuminate. Third, Piper runs out of topic fairly early in each chapter, but the chapters chug onward anyway. Finally, the phrase ""Christian Hedonist"" appears so frequently that I began to wonder if he had trademarked it and was coming out with a line of clothing.An editor could have helped immeasurably."
3,Solid,"This book came highly recommended from a number of sources, so I was eager to read it after my purchase. I consider myself somewhat of a theologian (by no means an expert) having recieved a BA in theology from a Christian liberal arts school. The book really didn't inform or inspire me the way I had hoped. Piper who is unquestionably academic and holds a PhD from Munich wrote the book in a scholarly format (Chicago/Turabian style) packed full of footnotes. But I really didn't learn anything from this particular work. It my have to do with me be brought up in the Reformed Christian tradition. I kept begging him to tell me something I didn't know, but I was unable to find anything fresh and new. I'm not trying to come across as a snob, but if you have studied and are familiar with the basics of reformed theology you will not find anything in this book you don't already know. That said many have raved about this book and found inspiration from it. Though scholars of theology need not bother."
3,Desiring God,"I wanted to get my review up of Desiring God by John Piper. I got this book from blogging for books to review late last year and never put the review up. My fault.I had heard a lot of great things about Desiring God and have always admired Piper's ministry. However, I found that the book fell short of my lofty expectations. I expected it to make it to the top ten of my books read list and it didn't even come close.Honestly, it's probably more of the book against my expectations than the merits of the book itself.Piper sets out to show the reader how the life lived in God, can be a life of joy! How we can all be Christians Hedonists as he calls it. It's a favorite topic of mine and there really isn't anyone who does it better than John Piper. He is the first source I go to when I look for stuff on living for the glory of God, and doing so in JOY.Honestly, I didn't finish the book. But, like I said it's probably more my fault of unfair expectations than anything else."
4,Strong Book,I liked this book but a bit of a let-down with so much hype. I absolutely adore John Piper who has become an inspirational hero in my life and in the ministry. While I say this book was a bit of a let-down I will read it again. You can't go wrong but perhaps with more than fifty of his sermons under my belt- maybe much more it is so similar because his life is etched in the pages. He has taught me as a Christian to think!CSL
4,The Pleasure in God,"""Desiring God - Meditations of a Christian Hedonist"" by John Piper is a book that will challenge - and possibly change - you worldview. In a world that teaches to live for yourself - your pleasures whether instant or long term - are the main focus of a secular life. But for the Christian all of this should - must! - change. Piper here sets out how we can find our purpose as Christians in a secular, self-serving world. God is a God who delights in us and desires that we delight in Him. The chapter on marriage ALONE is worth the read. Find pleasure in God - enjoying, worshiping, and serving Him. It is really possibly to delight ourselves in the Lord for He is our master, our joy a, dour treasure. A true classic."
4,Same old Gemmell and i'm ok with that,David Gemmell of late lamented memory always had a talent for sword and sorcery fiction he was one of the very best. This particular installment like the Dereni series pits the forces of good against the forces of evil battle lines are drawn and magic and heroic last stands abound those of you who have read the author before will not be disappointed.Overall-The only sad part is that Gemmell left us so soon given a few more books Tarantio could have proudly taken his place alongside Waylander and Drus unfortunately this was not to be. As a standalone the book is still excellent.
5,Stunning,"This book was amazing. Like all of Gemmell's books it takes the typical high fantasy story and the typical hero, and he makes you beleive in them. He tackles the tough issues from numerous angles, and fills his world with people you know. He plays in the grey area's of morality, while still making people who beleive in black and white. honestly, I have never read any author that so captures the way humanity thinks. he is the best."
2,Bunny Uprising,The story line spent more time on bunnies than the resurrection. It only quoted scripture rather than translating it to communicate with children. It also did not hold the interest of my four children
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed by this film because it didn't spend much time focusing on the meaning of Easter. It is cute, but probably not worth the money."
5,Twas the Night Before Easter,"This is a typical fantastic Veggie Tales DVD that is both entertaining while presenting an important message. We enjoyed watching it with our seven year old grandson. Highly recommend for kids of all ages so they know that Easter is not just about bunnies, chocolate, and eggs."
2,Star Of Christmas redo,"We saw the promo for this on Meaningful Life ( great one, btw) and when we saw it was out, we snagged it.except the promo is NOT what this movie is.It's Star of Christmas redone...and not even redone well.they even admit in the commentary that they changed it after the promo- dont elaborate on why- and that its basically the same as Star of Christmas.They dont even touch on the True meaning of Easter- which is what i wanted and am trying to teach my children.they LOVE the robot bunny... but thats REALLY not what i had in mind.there have a few good veggie tales lately- this is not. avoid this one!"
4,Great movie for fun....not great for teaching the true meaning of Easter,"Like others, I found this video lacking a bit. Not because the animation wasn't great....because it was. My girls had fun watching it & they loved the songs that were sung (the songs are always a great part of Veggie tales). But it's true that it didn't really teach about the True Meaning of Easter. It mentioned about Jesus Christ dying for us....but my girls easily missed that part.We can still enjoy this video, because it is appropriate for young children and the characters are cute & sometimes silly. But don't buy this one if you are looking for a teaching tool about the true Meaning of Easter....it's not really there."
2,Tablature only,"Coming from a classical music background, it'll take me extra hours /days to learn to read the tablature and finding the right sounding note on the fretboard. Because of this, the usefulness of this book decreses, and therefore I prefer ""Bluegrass Guitar"" by Happy Traum, which has not only tablature but also staff with streble cleff side by side. Traum's book is also twice the music material than Barenberg's book and sells about the same price."
3,beginning bluegrass,"Super beginning bluegrass instruction. Great deal for twelve bucks. The CD is wonderful and makes it easy to play along. There are ""breaks"" versions and ""backup"" versions of all the songs in the book--I found that very helpful! The songs are extremely simple renditions of a few traditional bluesgrass songs such as Pretty Polly, Nine Pound Hammer,Foot Prints in the Snow, Rolling in My Sweet Baby's Arms. I learned ""Salt Creek"" from it. I already knew a pretty good rendition of Dan Crary's ""Soldier's Joy"" and I think the verson in this book is very simple. A bit too simple for anyone but a true beginner. There a nice section devoted to reading tab and also playing some very basic bluegrass licks. Definitely worth $12 if you are a beginner. Intermediate/Advanced players should pass--you probably already know everything in the book. Super beginner book."
3,Don't Rely on This Book Alone,"I don't really use this book as an instructional tool, but I do play some of the songs. The print makes the tab a little more difficult to read than other books that I own, but it's still pretty clear. The song selection is nice. The CD is a bonus, but the singing was distracting. I should also mention that the songs are presented in tablature only, so those who are looking for standard notation will be disappointed. My husband owns the Teach Yourself Bluegrass Banjo book. The books don't include exactly the same songs, but there are several of the same tunes that we can play together. I foundMel Bay First Lessons Flatpicking Guitar Book/CD Setto be much more helpful in learning to play bluegrass guitar, whileBluegrass Guitar Classics: 22 Carter-Style Solosis my favorite collection of easy bluegrass songs."
1,Complete waste of money,"If you are in need of holes in randomly allocated places along the sides of your documents, this might just be the device for you.It is certainly a heavy and expensive hole punch. Unfortunately, the paper guide that one would normally expect to define where the holes go does not even try to work - it is just a flimsy bit of metal that slides around with no tether, with no way I can see to hold it in place.I fiddled a lot with this thing, and, having discarded the box (who ever expects a hole punch to be defective?), have thrown the thing in the trash.No more Swingline products, thank you."
2,Swingling Hole Punch,"This hole punch was advertised as being adjustable...but it takes a screwdriver to adjust it! I was looking for something simpler to operate, so I returned it."
5,excellent for the price,"It nice, durable and my 4 year old daughter loves it. It's been a hit since she got it. The door bell rings with a soft nice music, however we've lost the flags... and one of the cupulas."
2,Mediocre work,"From the moment a white statue swung into view suspended from a helicopter, I knew that this would not be good. What could a glaring homage to ""La dolce vita"" add to a movie about a Russian mobster's family? It was only a childish diversion, but it exemplified the essential incompetence of the writer and director, incapable of an original idea and--far worse--incapable of a well orchestrated scene. There is a general awkwardness here, a sense of aspiring to making a movie but having only the most primitive idea of how to assemble a series of dramatic moments into a whole. The characterizations are obvious, the dialogue borrowed from five other gangster movies, the cinematography intrusive. Avoid this one."
2,"The Russian version of ""the Godfather""","This is a Russian version of the Godfather, featuring Jennifer Jason Leigh as an exterminator who lives in a trailer who gets called to the Russian Mafia leader's home in Malibu to clean up the morning after a retirement party and gets drawn into more than she bargained for. It is entertaining, containing copious amount of sex and violence,as well as insights into the lifestyles of the rich and famous, and it is nice to know that the Russians can make an entertaining film. With its dramatic ending, it almost deserves 4 stars."
2,"1970? doubt this film is 1970, think its suppose to be 1989","well what do you expect from sub rosa productions? not much at all thats for sure. and is the green creature thats on the side of the DVD cover and on the DVD actually in the movie? that would be a big NO. decent watch and nothing more, actually better than most b-movies but nothing entirely special, did have great sound. but if your expecting a great haunted house flick then you will be mildly disappointed."
1,Stunk,I regret buying this movie....... It was boring.I fell asleep 10 times before I even finishedwatching it. I think it took a month to actuallysee the whole movie.I had to give this a 1 starfor having the guts to put it out for sale.
1,I can't remember if I found this under Horror or Comedy???,"I don't think this would even scare a 4 yr old! This was so poorly made that it was a riot just watching this [stuff]! I especially loved the opening scenes where that mummy looks like he's having a seizure! (and this is supposed to be scary??) Or how about the part where the doors are opening and closing by themselves and he stands there and goes ""Oh what now?"" The sequel wasn't much better...."
1,attempted bait and switch,"ORDERED--4 NEW LGIP-A1100E 1100 mah batteries-RECIEVED--4 USED LGIP-A1000E batteries and when I called to get RMA to return the batteries cellounge said and I quote ""these are the same as the ones you ordered-why don't you try to use them"" The baatteries were clearly used with scratches all over the bodies and the gold plated contacts scratched up,some seriously.After I got insistant the the battery was not the same and I wanted my money back they gave me a RMA-lets see if I really get my money back"
1,BUYER BEWARE ! ! !,"Amazon's Cell Phone Department is selling used accessories for your cell phone. So if you're hoping to get a new battery because yours is wearing thin, good luck. Take my advice. If you do order cell phone accessories from Amazom, call the Cell Phone Department directly. Tell the sales person exactly what you want. A new battery will have no markings on the brass connectors. Tell the sales person, that if you feel the product has been used or tampered with in any way, you'll send it back. Sales should tell you they'll make a note on your order.The second battery I received was in better shape than the first,but it was still used. Good luck again."
1,I thought I got a great deal but the battery was previously used!,"I was shocked when I opened the package to see that the battery looked like it had been sitting in the bottom of someone's purse for a year. It was dirty, with sticky little spots all over it. When I put it in my phone, it only had a 50% charge. I was desperate for a new battery because mine would not hold a charge at all, but there was no way I was going to settle for this used and dirty battery.I was really disappointed with Amazon on this purchase. They should not be selling used merchandise that is advertised as new."
3,not very good,"The delivery was very quick, but the quality of the battery was not very good, much worse than my orignal new battery."
1,Battery doesnt work,This battery worked as good as my old one that I have been using the past 2 years.
3,"better than what I had, but not ""new""","well, there's no doubt that what I received was a ""used"" battery, even though the product description says ""new."" I'm not going to go crazy, it was only $4...but still, why not just describe what it actually is. For example (and based on the mixed reviews): ""Moderately to Slightly-Used Batteries."" I mean, considering the state my battery was in before I made this purchase, a 90% discount on a moderately-used battery is still pretty awesome."
1,"Battery Ripoff, DO NOT BUY!! USED BATTERY!","I purchased this battery thinking it was new, no disclaimer that it is apparently a used battery. Very disappointed in Amazon for the bait and switch. I will request a full refund.Totally bogus advertising. Battery is worse than the one I replaced. Buyer beware!!!!!!!!"
3,Used battery?,"The battery I received had wear marks on the battery consistent with the cutouts in the backing plate for the battery. This makes me suspicious that this battery was previously installed in a phone that was made unusable for unknown reasons (battery upgrade, broken phone, etc.).The battery worked great out of the box, but the wear marks on the battery make me nervous about the longevity of this ""new"" battery."
3,LG Standard Battery,We ordered three batteries and two are working perfectly and one is not taking a full charge. Previous reviews had similar results so it seems as if there is a chance the battery might not work as you hope.
1,Rip Off,"I bought a battery sold as brand new. It came opend dirty and clearly used. I plugged it in anyway and it would not hold a charge at all. I sent it back with an angry message and was sent another dirty, old, and clearly used battery. It at least took a charge but it won't hold it for more than a few hours. Very, very, unhappy."
4,Problem Resolved Quickly,"I ordered 2 original equipment replacement batteries for my LG cell phone. I was concerned that the low price may indicate that the batteries were old, used or recycled. I was further concerned when I received batteries with different LG model numbers, but both of the correct size and voltage. However, one would not hold a charge any better than my old one. The problem was resolved with a quick email to Amazon and I had a properly functioning replacement within 3 days and a postage free return label for the bad battery. Congradulations on a simple, functional return policy."
2,"not the best supplier, did not get what I ordered",I received a non-genuine battery when I ordered a Genuine LG battery.. the knock off battery would not work in my phone. It was just a pain in the butt exchanging it and a little unethical shipping me a non-genuine when I ordered a genuine LG battery. they did eventually send send me the correct battery but only on my instance and continued follow up.
1,The Stench reached Europe,I ordered 2 LGVX 8300 batteries and one was completely dead (unrechargeable) and the other has 40% life left. Amazon should dump people like these.
1,You get what you pay for.,"I ordered one of these, and it was obviously used - charge lasted about 1 day with light/moderate use. I ordered a replacement, and it was even worse - dirt (not dust) on the battery, with about the same charge life. Don't waste your time & money with these."
1,Extremely Poor Quality Product,"First, if I could give the product a 0 stars I would, but that option was not available. The battery I received was not used--it was used up. The battery wear indicator was removed which should have been an indicator to the seller that someone didn't want anyone to know it was no longer any good--it could no longer hold a charge. A 3-minute call used up the battery charge and it had to be recharged. The quick service provided by the postal service was overshadowed by the poor quality of the product."
1,Great Price......No Life,"I purchased this battery and noticed that it did not maintain power for very long. I had it load tested at a ""Batteries Plus"" store and found out it tested at only 3%. The price I paid was excellent but the battery was worthless! If it looks too good to be true it probably is!!"
2,"Great Price, But Poor Quality.","I purchased this item based mostly on the price, and the fact that I can not find the original battery from Verizon. After less than a months use, the batteries are already acting like the old ones, ie: not holding a charge for very long, the need to recharge the battery on a daily basis, etc.I am glad that I purchased multiple batteries, because I have back-up as the keep dying."
2,Worked well for 6 mos.,"Worked well for six months then began to lose capacity for life. This battery is now in a sad state of total unusefulness. When not plugged in I get up to 15 minutes of talk time before getting the dreaded ""LOW BATTERY"" message. Anything longer than 20 minutes, the phone dies."
1,"Used Battery Sold As "" New""","I too read reviews from other buyers complaining that they received a used product. I was scepital since all my other transactions with Amazon has been flawless. I ordered two batterys and received these today. I opened the box and found one battery out of the package laying in the bottom of the box while the other battery was still in it's package. I inspected the batterys and both were scratched and showed signs of wear on the battery itself. The contact were scratched and discolored which could only happend if the batterys were used or recycled. What a dissapointment!I hope that Amazon would listen to the complants of there customers and address the problem with there supplier. I am returning the product today. I Like using Amazon because of the great service I have received in the past but next time, I will pay close attention to feedback given by other customers."
3,Cell Phone Batteries,"I purchased 2 cell phone batteries and 1 works just fine, but the second one is not holding the charge."
1,Very Disappointed,Sorry to say I am also one that received a used battery. Was excited about getting a great deal until I put the battery in and tried to use the phone and got maybe 2 minutes talk time. Verizon service center did verify the fact it was outdated (a model # no longer used by Verizon) and was non working. Ended up paying the $42 for a new Verizon battery. Battery has been returned to Amazon for refund
2,It's hit or miss on the quality of these batteries,Ordered two batteries. One kept its charge worse than the battery than I was replacing. The second has done a reasonable job of holding a charge.
2,What's with the used battery?,"I thought I had ordered a new LG battery for my cell phone. When I opened by order, I found a used battery free-floating in the box. The clear package it was supposed to come in was partially closed but empty. I initially thought, ""Oh,no! Someone in shipping switched my new battery with their used one!"" But then I read reviews for this product. I wish I had read them before ordering this battery. I'm not even going to try it out, based on the mixed reviews for holding charges. Amazon, you are my favorite shopping place - but you must be honest about this product!"
4,Don't pay high prices at the Verizon store!,I purchased two of these batteries for my self and my son when the originals quit taking a charge. They work as well as the ones that came with the phone. They look identical to the batteries we had. The are still fine after nearly a year. You can't beat the price since the local Verizon guy wanted 50.00 each for replacements! How do they get away with that? Worth the money!
4,I feel I made a good choice,"I like the fact that I made a good choice in choosing this battery, and most of all I saved money in the process I recommend this to anyone again a good choice .... Thanks Amazon"
1,One good and One terrible,"I purchased two of these and one works fine and the other my wife can't even be on the phone for one call and it dies. We charge it over night and within two minutes the phone goes dead. Good luck, I would say it is hit or miss."
4,LG Standard Battery,I am very happy with the performance of these batteries. The only thing that was hard to take was the shipping for two batteries. That was over $9.
5,Excellent Lithium Ion battery 3.7 volt LG,"This battery performs just as expected, which is excellent. My first one of this type lasted 7 years. That is about the typical life of lithium ion batteries. That is, according to what I have read on packages which contain my lithium battery power tools. After that they may not keep a charge. This one cost less than four dollars, including shipping, and delivery was made in three days."
3,Not a great battery--but probably as good as the original,"I bought the phone this battery goes to used and the battery that came with it barely lasted an hour before needing recharging. I get at least full day out of the new battery--which is about 1/2 to 1/3 as long as I got with my previous (newer)LG phone, but online reviews of this model phone strongly suggest it had a short life even when new. So I have no complaint--I wanted a cheap phone and that's what I got."
1,Battery for lG,"I have had very good experiences buying from Amazon, until now. I bought this ""new"" battery to replace a battery that would only charge up to 2 bars. It arrived in a regular postal envelope (really?). I charged it for 10 hours and got 2 bars. I have tried multiple times to charge it and never get more than 2 bars. If you advertise something as new you are bound to deliver a NEW not refurbished product. This battery was obviously not new. The seller was ACC."
1,Batteries are not NEW,"I bought three batteries. None of them have very good battery life. One had battery life less than 24 hours of idle time and in fact had shorter life than the 2 year old one that I was trying to replace. To add insult, when I emailed for an RMA to exchange it, I didn't even get a reply. I don't believe these are new batteries. If they are, they perform very poorly."
1,piece of junk,Why would any company sell a nonfunctional product? Amazon needs to get rid of this seller. Total rip-off and waste of my time.
2,purchased a 'new' battery,the 'new' battery came in a plastic zip bag and not the original packaging i expected from a new item. the contacts of the battery had markings that clearly indicated that it was used before...i'll give this battery a chance but i have my doubts on its longevity...
2,"low quality product, good customer service","I ordered this battery a month ago, and I received the package within a week. It was packaged in a sealed plastic bag...not commercial packaging that you would see at a retail store. The new battery only held a charge for 24 hours max. I emailed customer service and they quickly sent out a replacement battery. It holds a charge much better. Customer service was very good, but the first battery I received tainted my view of the product quality."
1,Another Unhappy Customer,"I too received a used battery: it's coated with some gooey substance, and the contacts are clearly marked from usage. True: it's a good price. But, I find it shocking that Amazon would sell used batteries without marking them as 'used'. In line with their typically excellent customer service, Amazon has refunded my purchase price. They might have saved me (and them) the bother by just writing 'used' here, however."
1,"poor not ""new"" batteries","The batteries were sold as new, they definately were not and performed worse then the battery I wanted to replace. Don't order batteries from Amazon it is just a waste of time. At this time I am still waiting for my refund as well."
2,Talk time decreased over 5-month life of battery,"This is the battery that came with my PM225. When I got the phone, I got 3-4 hours of talk time. Now I get no more than 2 hours. I noticed that the battery started decaying after I downloaded Tetris to my phone and played it quite a bit. Since I gave up the Tetris, the talk time has leveled out. But it's so little time that I can use it up in no time flat. I'm buying a new battery now, yippee."
4,Very Good Portable Compressor,This thing increased the pressure 8 lbs in 20 seconds. You can't beat that in a portable unit. I wish I didn't have to screw the nozzle into the valve stem though.
4,"Basic without ""Bells & Whistles""",Compressor provides air at good rate in reasonable time frame. Coiled line provides convenience. AC adapter would be desired addition but there must be a reason it isn't included.
1,"noisy, burned up quickly","I have a friend of mine who turned me on to this compressor. He has had his for a year or more now and it works flawlessly. It is also very quiet. Not sure what happened with mine. It was noisy from the start, I thought it was the cage rattling or something, but now I'm thinking there is a problem with the motor. The fuse holder burned completely in two from the over amp draw. I've never filled up more than my 265/75/R16 tires from 15 to 35 on about four trail runs. Too bad, compressor worked great when it worked. Only had it 3 1/2 months."
1,Caught FIRE.,"I was extremely impressed with the compressor when I bought it. I used it twice and was very happy. On the third use, I noticed a strange smell. I then realized that the part of the power cord where the fuse is (where it's supposed to blow the fuse instead of allowing an electrical problem) was on fire. Fortunately the problem happened in my driveway, not out on the trail. Being stranded by bad equipment is the WORST.The cord is melted through and unless I find a way to take the unit apart to replace the cord, the compressor is completely useless.Very disappointing. I'd look elsewhere."
4,MV50 Superflow Pump,"I have tried several low priced compressors for use as inflating the tires on my Ford F350. Most of them either take forever or simply cannot handle the pressure. I have even burned several of them out. The MV50, however, is strong and fast and easily up to the task. There are only two drawbacks: The unconventional tire inflator fitting on the end of the hose can be difficult to use depending on wheel configuration. I would have preferred a more traditional fitting, especially with a reverse ""truck chuck"" on it. The only other problem is the cord is too short. This unit must be attached to your vehicle's battery and the cord will not permit inflation of the rear tires on my F350 crew cab with the 8 foot bed. that being said, its easy enough to just hook up jumper cables to bridge that gap, plus most vehicles are not as long as mine anyway. All in all, this is a great product at a good price."
3,Good Compresser - Short Hose,"Powerful and quick to inflate. Problem is hose will not reach rear tires on larger vehicles like vans, small rv, or small trailer behind car. you must purchase longer hose or extend electrial connection to battery to accomplish the task of reaching tires farthest from the battery of the vehicle."
2,"Hi-Volume, Lo-Pressure","The compressor comes with a nice two compartment bag. Each part of the bag is a bit tight. The first time I went to use the compressor, it was for my trailer wheels which were loaded. The tires already had 30psi in them, and the pump (connected to the battery with engine running), could not inflate the tires. If the tire has no load, it can inflate it. I had to go to a service station to get the air pressure up, using one of those automated $1.00 /3 minutes compressors. Disappointing. Nest time I'd buy a cheapo at Walmart."
1,Dead out of the box with blown fuse!,"This Compressor arrived dead out of the box with a blown fuse!This should have been a ""red flag"" to the person testing this prior to shipping?We replaced the blown out fuse with a known good fuse and this Compressor MV50 would still NOT power-on with a small load attached.We were only trying to inflate a standard auto tire a few pounds.We verified that the cables were attached properly with a voltage meter.+ tested the replacement fuse to make sure it was not also blown.Even with the verified good fuse the Compressor MV50 would NOT power on under a small load.This compressor MV50 was a big headache and we returned it pronto!"
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this exact compressor from another vendor and it is a piece of junk.The compressor itself works, but the air hose is inferior.After my second use, the hose came apart. Very poor crimping on the part of the manufacturer.This product is made in China which explains the poor quality of teh product.I would not recommend this product unless you can get it for less than $20, it's not even worth that much."
3,Good system,"This is a well built and decent mobile emergency air system. The only real problem is the lack of a long enough power cord to reach the locations I need the air in a lot of my situations. I pull a big horse trailer and there is simply no way I can make it reach the trailer tires from the under hood batteries!! A cigarette lighter power plug adapter would also be nice and avoid having to get under the hood, would make reaching at least the rear tires of a big pickup easier!"
3,fair pump,"ok pump. 1 screw was stripped when i got it. still worked, locktite the screw and no more problems there. overall better than most."
5,Very good value,"This kit was everything it is advertised as, It is well worth the money. The only thing i do not know about is the life of the product, as i have not used it much to know if it will last."
1,Defective out of box,Unfortunately I need to add to the negative reviews of this project. I just tried the compressor for the first time tonight. The motor turns over at high RPM but the pump is not turning. This failure right out of the box does not give much confidence in these units.
1,Absolute Piece of Garbage,"Being stranded in the outback of Moab after my brand new SuperFlow compressor quit working after airing up 1 1/2 of 4 tires was my experience. The fuse box melted around the fuse and the unit quit pumping air. I was able to replace the fuse, but to no avail. It was a long slow drive back to Moab on tires with 12 psi. I read similar bad reviews but believed the problem must have been fixed as so many good reviews were also posted. I guess if you are the gambling type and don't mind being stuck miles from anywhere, this might be the product for you. As for me, I learned a valuable lesson. I just hope Amazon's legendary customer service take this piece of garbage back - never again Q Industries. One star is one too many for this product."
4,"Positive, But...","The Q MV50 pump is a great device. And it works just as advertised. My only issue with it is (or was) that the power cord was too short. So I got out the soldering iron and added about 7' of cord.The problem could have been solved by extending the air line, but it tended to coil up thus putting stress on the valve stem.Great unit nonetheless."
1,Small Air Compressor,"This small compressor was a Xmas gift, I had no need of it until early January. I connected it up per instructions and it never activated. I changed fuses and hooked up to different 12v batteries but it never ran. I went to the web page which was useless so I returned it to Amazon. It was just junk as far as I was concerned."
2,Keeps blowing fuse,"I bought this unit to air-up tires on my F-250 while desert camping in Baja. First used it this past July (after airing down when stuck deep in the sand south of San Felipe) I got one tire (265/75/17) filled to 75psi and the unit's fuse blew. Replaced it but blew fuse again after filling second tire. Borrowed one last fuse from my truck fuse box and aired up a third tire and fuse blew again. Had to limp back to town with one tire at 25psi. I should mention that it was very HOT and in the middle of the day at our campsite on the Sea of Cortez, 100 degrees or so, but I did let the unit cool down after 12-15 minutes of use per the manual. Otherwise, the unit worked well on my stock E-rated tires. Just bring a handful of 30amp fuses and maybe let the unit rest after 10 minutes of use."
1,Don't ever break the hose,"Great compressor when it works but the cheap hose gets holes in it. The connectors from the compressor to the hose are a non standard size and thread. It is impossible to replace the hose with a standard hose. When the hose goes, the compressor is worthless."
4,Heavy duty does the trick,"Great size for my 4 wheel drive, fills tires up real fast. Powers off the battery, no auto lighter power."
4,works good,works goodthe end piece is a pain in the a$$ screwing it on the tire all the timeit doesnt work too well in the -10 to 15 degree weather unless you warm it up
2,Compressor,"Like other people mention it was okay for a while and then the fuse holder melted the fuse (I didn't blow), and then melted the plastic fuse holder. The unit gets very hot. In hindsight to hot to inflate 4 tires.I now have a power cord that i need to either 1. cut out the fuse and replace or 2. replace the power cord. I had only used the compressor a handful of times.If its for emergencies then i would get this. If its for filling up 4 big tires after wheeling i would skip and get something more reliable. I am currently looking at ARB compressors."
1,Total Garbage!!,First use and the unit over heated and burnt out the engine. It also superheated the air and melted an air hose I purchased. Do not buy this garbage! Couldn't even take 4 tires from 29psi - 35psi without failing.
5,Excellent Product,I am a government employee living overseas and this has come in handy on more than one occasion. A monkey could set this thing up it's so easy. This filled up a completely empty 275/75/17 tire on my toyota 4Runner in about 3 minutes. I don't leave the house without this product in my vehicle. I liked it so much I bought another one to keep in my 2nd vehicle.
1,I got robbed,"It filled up about a 1/2 tire before it stopped working. For the money I paid I expect quality. After it died I was thinking, I bet it was from china. I should have checked before hand."
2,It's Missing?,"Imagine buying a product that advertises its use on bicycles, basket balls, car tires etc, and finding out that you better have a vehicle battery accessible. It doesn't plug in to an outlet, so hope you don't mind your kids hooking up to your car when they need some air in their tires. Stay away"
5,Remarkable,I have spent more money for compressors that did far less or failed right off the line. Running any battery charger or compressor of this size off the cigarette lighter is a myth. Create your own appropriately rated circuit or connect directly to the battery and pay attention to the overheat prevention cycles. Common Sense = Great Tool
3,Manufacturing defect and unresponsive customer service,"When I received my MV50 it was well packaged and I almost decided to just toss it in my trunk for the next day I really needed to pump up my tires. It turns out, testing it was well worth my time. The air hose didn't actually fit on the nozzle. I emailed the company and they have yet to respond to my inquiry. It has been more than a week.... I'm sure it is just a minor manufacturing defect; however, if you're looking for a quality product that is supported by a reachable manufacturer, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this one."
1,It died in 3 months,"I bought this airpump because I had one before that I gave to a friend in need.This pump keeps blowing fuses. It worked the first 2 or 3 times I used it, but now it blows a fuse every try.Amazon wont let me return it, because its been mine too long, 3 months.Bad luck gamble, I think I will buy a Viar instead, but not from Amazon.. no personal loyalty to the customer, just a bunch of weblinks to return policy text..oh well.. better to shop locally sometimes, where service counts"
2,Hopefully a lemon,Heard a lot about these on surf fishing websites and the good reviews on amazon. Purchased in march 2011along with a compact compressor for my motorcyclefrom same company.the compact compressor quit working minutes after starting the first use. The mv50 superflow required tightening of several of the external hex head bolts upon receipt.on first use it melted the supplied circuit breakers plastic casing but did not damage the breaker itself. Replaced breaker with supplied extra and it worked twice more before it stopped putting out air. It would run but not put out air. Iam going to primarily use this item to pump up my lawn mower tires because they deflate every week but I want it also to reinflate the tires on my truck on trips to nags head north carolina. I can't trust this thing for something like that. Will try another brand.
1,Highly unreliable product with no customer service,Beware of this company Q industries. Their products are highly unreliable and they have absolutely no contact information from which to get any customer service.Their air compressor overheats in a matter of minutes and you are lucky if you can fill 1 tire before the unit dies for an unspecified amount of time.The attachments and accessories are junk as is the unit itself.Better to stick with a better known company/brand who can offer you customer service when you need it.
4,Great product,"Bought this for my truck. I use it in conjunction with a 5 gallon tank in a O.B.A. setup. I hard mounted it in the engine compartment and plumbed it in to the truck with air lines. The only crappy part is the outlet on the compressor is some kind of metric crap. I had to tap it out with a 1/4"" NPT tap so that it would mate up to a normal air outlet. Once the system is at pressure it takes my 37""s from 5psi to 25psi in about 10 mins. That all 4 tires! With the tank it easily runs air tools out on the trail. I would buy it again."
5,Excellent Mini-Compressor,"I searched the mini-compressors for quite a time looking for the one that would be able to do the job. At first I felt I needed one that plugged into the cigarette lighter, but then I found that the only ones that would not blow the fuse, weren't very powerful. I decided on the MV50 SuperFlow. Yeah, you have to clip it to your battery, but at least I know I'm not going to blow a fuse. It has it's own fuse in the power line, with spare incase you do blow it. I am very satisfied with this mini-compressor. It's all I could have hoped for after the hours I spent researching the different products."
4,It works,"It will work just not very fast. If you have tires over 31"" it takes some time to air back up. Its not a bad product at all, its just not very fast. If you need it for bike tires awesome piece to have."
4,12v Compresser,"I just returned from a trip to S.D. where I used this item for the first time, other than just making sure it ran. It worked well and was surprisingly fast at airing a low tire up. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was that the pressure gauge fogged up, preventing me from using it. However that was not an insufferable loss as I always check pressure with a hand held air gauge that I trust. Other than the fogging, it gets a thumbs up from me."
1,Save your money- buyer beware!,"I thought this was going to be a high quality compressor based on reviews here. The unit worked once, on one tire, then never again. It cost me half the price of the unit to send it back to the company. If they warranty it quickly and refund my shipping money I will change my review, but I will be very surprised if they do. Made in China.This is probably the last time I buy something like this online."
1,MV50 SuperFlow Compressor,"First of all, Amazon was great and I have no problem with them. On the contrary, they make returns very easy and fair. I purchased this item several weeks ago and it was defective. It would not run at all. These things happen, so a returned it for a replacement of the same unit. The second unit was defective as well. Not recommended."
1,THE LITTLE RED COMPRESSOR THAT COULDN'T,"Same problem as other reviewers had... First time I tried to use it the compressor did not work... Checked circuitry and got continuity but nothing else... Tried to call Q Ind but phone disconnected... Tried to e-mail but no response... Spoke to Amazon about it but they would not honor Q Ind warranty (had product more than 30 days)... Don't understand why Amazon allows the product to be sold... I guess it's the kind of product that should be purchased at a bricks and mortar store... As a result, would not recommend this vendor or product... I intend to get some use from it as an anchor for my Kayak when I'm out fishing..."
3,"Good compressor, LOUSY quality control","2 of my friends bought this same compressor through amazon to mount under the hood of their 4wd vehicles for airing up tires after a day on the trail. They were both very pleased and so was I when I saw how well they worked, so I ordered my own. The first one I got worked for a total of 2 1/2 minutes and that is not an exaggeration. It just stopped pumping air even though the motor was running. Sent it back and got the same thing. The one I have now works, BUT....... if I leave it on for more than a minute or two, the piston housing gets so hot that you can't touch it! It still continues to work even when it gets hot but, it does worry me. I have not sent it back because it is hard mounted under the hood and I'm too lazy to pull it out and package it up. In short, out of 4 of these that I've seen, 2 have been awesome and 2 not so awesome. If you are ok with 50/50 odds...Go for it!"
3,Could be better...,"This thing has never actually failed to do what it's supposed to do. But there have been problems. I'm waiting for replacement number 2 to arrive.The first one was OK for the first 3 or 4 uses, filling medium sized truck tires back up to 35 psi from 15. However it developed an issue where it would not make any pressure until it ran for a minute or so to warm up. After warmup it was fine.The first replacement (obviously a rebuilt unit) they sent would run slow and sound unhappy at first, then speed up but still sound erratic. It did still move air properly.Warranty service has been pretty good via email so far. 12 days from my first email until I had replacement #1. We'll see how #2 goes. If it has a problem too, I'm going with some other brand."
4,Fast and Hot,"We do a lot of off road mountain jeeping and bought this compressor to save time when we air up. The compressor works fine, is very fast, approximately 2 min. per tire and it is small enough so that we were able to have this compressor mounted under the hood. My only complaint is that it gets extremely hot, must be very careful when disconnecting the cord from the compressor when done. The first time I used it, the part where the coiled line joined the compressor even melted some. I use leather gloves when using the compressor but otherwise it works fine."
4,Pump for in the car,"Looks to be a very heavy duty piece. Only tried it one time, before putting it in the trunk of my '03 Corv convert (to make sure it worked). Brought pressure up on the large tires quickly. Used strictly for emergency inflation, after getting rid of the noisy run flat capable tires were replaced.Only some very minor negative comments: in order to use the storage bag, the hose and air filter need to be disconnected from the compressor. Air filter is all plastic, so if you were to hit it firmly against something, you might be able to break it off of the compressor (hence removing it prior to storage in bag). Would be nice to have a, gas station like, press on tire valve connector, rather than screw on. These items so minor, that I didn't consider them in my rating, for an otherwise strong device."
5,"35"" tires...no problem!","I use the MV50 SuperFlow Hi-Volume Air Compressor to air up my 35"" tires. When I go off road I air them down to about 17 psi. The big deal is getting them back up to the road pressure of 45psi. The MV50 does this without overheating and relatively fast. Four tires from 17-45 takes about 20 minutes. That's pretty good considering the amount of volume need to do this. I also aired up a friends trailer tire from 25 psi to 70 psi. That only took a few minutes. I have had several 12V Air Compressors before the MV50 and they all overheated and died. The MV50 is a true bargain that lives up to what it says it can do without overheating!"
5,As Advertised!,"Great quality, size and functionality. Terrrific price. I purchased after going over many reviews. I recommend"
1,Sheice of Pit,"This thing inflated one half of a tire and then stopped blowing air. It will blow if there is no pressure, but hook it up to anything that pushes back and it does absolutely nothing other than get ridiculously hot. Don't buy this useless rubbish.Go to Harbor Freight and you will find any number of superior compressors for less money."
5,Great little compressor,"I bought this to replace a cheap smaller one I've had for many years. There is no comparison, this compressor works fast.The first one I recieved had a fogged face on the pressure gauge, Amazon replaced it FAST with no hastles. The second also had a fogged gauge, it seems that the adhesive for the label on the face of the gauge is not compatible with the plastic face. I just used some polishing compound and the gauge is now readable."
5,great air compressor!,"I used the MV50 for the first time this weekend after fourwheeling. I aired up all 4 of my 33"" mud tires and all 4 of a friends 32"" all terrains in the time it took our other friend to air up his 33"" all terrains using an arb twin air compressor. This little thing PUTS OUT SOME AIR!It does get hot, but that's to be expected with a compressor this small. The air line is long enough to reach all 4 tires with the compressor sitting on the engine."
1,Toxic pigswill,Reparative therapy has been outlawed in Ecuador and denounced by the American Psychiatric Association. It consists of tormenting brainwashed homosexuals until they reach some unrealistic point where they think they are beginning to please an unpleasable God. The late Warren Johansson rightly denounced this sort of thing as spiritual murder. Barnhouse's theory of the cause of homosexuality is complete nonsense.
1,Delia Tudor Parnell (Nee Stewart) & Charles Stewart,"Delia Tudor Parnell, nee Stewart, did not die in 1892 or in Bordentown, New Jersey at Montpelier. She died at Avondale, Wicklow, Ireland (the Parnell home) in 1898 in a terrible accident; her dress caught fire and she died an extremely painful death.Charles Stewart, son of Admiral Charles Stewart, did not die in Paris in 1874. He died in Rome, Italy in 1872.These factual discrepencies do not give me much comfort that this biography is trustworthy."
1,Not good.,"If you are only toasting one slice of bread, only one side actually toasts! Surprisingly I am not happy with this toaster."
5,Cuisanart 4 slice toaster,We are very satisfied with our four slice toaster. It came just before Christmas and we have been putting it to good use. We would highly recommend this product.
5,Excellent,I purchased this for a birthday present. My friend was very happy with it and said it is perfect for everyones different tastes. she loved it.
2,Burnt toast!!,"I have to say this product is a disappointment to me. I chose it because of the features it offered (great concept for a family), but I can't get decent toast out of this machine. Some slots toast one side and burn the other, the rest just seem to burn it...and this is on a setting of 2! Actually I started on 5 since that seemed like a good place to start and ajust from there. Would you believe that the 5, 4, 3 and 2 all work the same?? There has been no difference in the slices that came out. While the concept is good, I am not pleased with the results."
2,Shawn's Review,"Todd O'Cconer is a junior in high school and he plays soccer. There's a new kid that moves in from California and he's really good. Randy was the leading scorer on last years varsity team and he's worried that the new kid Alex will take his spot at right wing. Randy isn't very found of Alex. SO Todd is stuck in the middle of it while Todd's having a problem with Randy because Randy is hitting on Todd's girlfriend Kai. Kai was having a party and Todd was upset because he wasn't invited and he shows up in his Uncle Gordo's brand new BMW and Ranndy aggs Todd to follow him witch Randy really doesn't want him to, so Todd tells Ka i to get into the BMW and Todd takes off and follows Randy and Todd TAkes a turn to faast and Randy parked his truck right after the turn and Todd barely misses him and runs off the road barely misses a tree buyt accidently put a big scratch in his Uncles car. THis book is really good and very exciting. I think it is a good book to read for a book report."
1,Do not buy this DVD!,"...this DVD they're selling is a bootleg/pirate DVD made in Brazil. It is NOT official. The *real* Wembley DVD will be a 2 DVD set and will be released in June.The bootleg DVD on this page was copied off the laserdisc, so the quality is so-so, it's not the full show, etc. Please do not waste your money.The REAL DVD will be the entire concert, with a DTS track and have loads of extra features, so do yourself a favor and wait for the official DVD."
3,takes forever to stretch,breaking these in take a while. The shine is nice but the heels chips easily still using these. Don't know what else to tell you
3,"Great shoe, had to reglue.",The shoe is exactly what it is supposed to be. The only issue i had is that the felt on the front of each shoe started to come off after just a few rehearsals. I glued them back on and they are fine now. A little annoyed I had to do that for the amount these shoes cost
3,Size was too small.,"I'm sure this would be a fine shoe if it fit. Ordered a size 9w. It was a about a inch less in length than the size 9 I normally wear. Return was free, but I am disappointed that the size did not conform to what I thought was a standard."
3,"Had to return them, and at a cost to me","The shoes arrived timely, but they were too tight. The description on Amazon gave no clue to fitness, like order 1/2 size larger. Buying from Timberland my 13M size fits perfectly. Amazon was easy enough to do the return, but they charged my account $5 for that privilege. Zappo, Timberland make returns cost free. I've decided to never purchase shoes the Amazon way."
2,Flimsy and cheap,"Made in China, lightweight, and cheap. They made no difference for me. In fact I much prefer dancing in my own dress shoes."
4,I'm happy...,First things first...I AM NEW TO BALLROOM DANCING.The shoe seemed a bit expensive and I am glad I bought it a little large because the shoe is very snug fitting. I have no idea if should be that way or not but it is. Keep that in mind before you order. If you have wide feet you might want to look for a wide size if available. The shoe is nice and light and allows for controlled sliding across the dance floor.
2,The Shoes Were Fine; Amazon's Exchange Policy Was Not,"I ordered these shoes for an event. I ordered wide and a half-sized up. Note to anyone considering these: the wides are pretty narrow too!I called Amazon to exchange and after getting 30 minutes of back and forth and hold times while the Amazon customer service rep ""researched solutions."" I was told they do not do exchanges on shoes. She told me all I can do is return them and order a different pair.My advise is: purchase these locally, or (if you are still insisting on getting them from Amazon) order larger and be prepared to invest a substatintial amount of your money and time with returns and reorders before you can get a pair that fits.Capezio makes great quality dance shoes, it is a pitty that Amazon's customer service cannot deliver on a similar quality.Seriously, buy them elsewhere."
1,Don't Buy It,"Don't waste your money. It works with the cards that were included, but does NOT work on any other cards. My parents are 80 yrs old, with bad arthritis. I spent $150 on this for them. It's been nothing but a let-down. Their favorite card game is SkipBo. These cards do not work in it at all! It just collects dust now."
4,Excalibur Professional six deck card shuffler,"I love the product design and the sturdy construction; however, the shuffling ability on batteries is a bit slower than anticipated and the cards have to tilted up manually to feed properly. Also, the unit does not come with a power adapter which costs approx $14 plus shipping. I do recommend this product, but I am somewhat disappointed in the belief that I was getting a higher end product for the money, which shouldn't require much human intervention to function properly."
4,"Good, but not great.","Upon receiving this item, the instructions say to plug in the shuffler... It doesn't come w/ a power adapter and furthermore, there is an order form in the box to order one! Called Excalibur about this and I'll sum up my conversation with ""oh well and woopsie."" They are out of stock on these power supplies too. They are 7.5vdc 1amp with a 5.5mm x 2.1mm plug. Expect to find them for about $20-30.The shuffler does a pretty good job. I'm still happy to have it as 2 players w/ 5 decks is now more enjoyable. Seems to shuffle 1-4 cards per sides consistently. Running them through 3-4 times is a great shuffle."
4,kc daylighters,very nice lights pretty bright and comes with easy to install and understand wiring diagram... very nice lights and looks very good on a truck with 6 of them.
1,worst product ever,"I installed these lights and yes they are easy to install, however after only 5 minuets of them being on, the bulb inside the houseing started to smoke and made the lens foggy, the heat of the bulb also burned the reflecing lens at the back causing the lights to not be bright. Amazon.com swapped out the first set, and wouldnt you know the new set did the same thing. Amazon.com would not let me change for something else, and said that my money will be tied up for 4 weeks. I will NEVER again purchase KC brand lights due to this, and I most likely will not buy from Amazon.com as well."
5,miles of smiles,"Andrea Perry certainly creates a wonderful world with words. With zany solutions to everyday problems, she brings adults and kids into a place where the answer makes us all smile.Each time you read it, something new reveals itself. The cleverness is endless. Alan Snow acheives the same with elaborate illustrations.My kid audience can't hear these stories enough, nor can I read them enough!This is a fantastic book to be enjoyed by EVERYONE!"
5,"Fun, fun, fun","This collection is brilliantly written, sharp, and hilarious. My daughter is still a bit too young for it (5) but she thought the poems were very funny and liked the zany concepts. I love how they're all written in the voice of a cheesy advertisement. Really adds to the humor.I got this book from the library but I think I'll need to add it to my collection."
3,Deep Purple (Only) at the California Jam,"Quality video of Deep Purple at the California Jam April 6, 1974. ABC put on this show with Black Oak Arkansas, Black Sabath, Emmerson Lake And Palmer,Earth Wind & Fire, the Eagles, and of course Deep Purple (maybe others). They recorded the show wall to wall and cut it up and played it in two nights in 74 and repaeted it in 75. It was played in stero on FM radio at the same time.WHERE IS ABC WITH THE REST OF THE CONCERT?"
4,ritchie burned and tumbled his guitar everywhere!,"MK III Purple line up (Coverdale, blackmore, hughes, lord, paice)at that time was on the california huge stage in 1974 together along ELP, Black sabbath etc...The whole set was on fire, Burn is the open song who is still incredible to listen, might just take your life is the second song (you can still find the great melody on it), smoke on the water and space trucking closed the set. the cameraman from ABC television was too close to the lead guitar player, it caused him aggressive and angry. This show is one of the finest Blackmore 's act on stage. this video is a Must for all purple fans."
4,buy the soundtrack either!,the footage on the DVD show 1974 Deep Purple California jamming was also avalibale in a cd format. Do not forget to buy it either! support deep purple for 20 years!! long time fan Doni
3,"OK, but.....","Recently used this guide for a visit to Sao Paolo, Parati, Brasilia and Rio. I did appreciate the more functional approach (settling, exploring) compared to rough guide or lonely planet. Also, the intented audience appears to be a bit older / less backpack / more money, which worked out nice in this case (Brasil is cheap :-). The information appears to be fairly accurate, and did indeed help us book hotels and visit attractions.However, not all was well. For Rio nightlife try to find other sources of info. One area where this frommers fails badly is maps. Not only do the maps contain errors - attractions drawn in at wrong locations - but the range / level of detail is way too limited. The lonely planet is much better in this regard (although that guide does have some major other problems, like shameless selfpromotion of other items in their stable)"
4,Nice... that's it,"Nice strap, at least it's not made in China. I thought it would be better but I guess this their entry level strap."
2,"Assertiveness/Boundaries, Setting Restoring Limits","I wanted a DVD to use with teens in counseling sessions. This DVD is NOT appropriate for that. The speaker is not a good narrator. Also, it is somewhat boring.Patricia Howard, LPC"
1,thought this was gonna be cool and funny,seen him on police academy and thought that he was a cool guy but after watching this dvd he was just kinda creepy to me. speaking of wanted to google the guy.
5,"More fairies, please!","I love fantasy and romance, and Gloria Harchar gives me both in her Quelgheny series. Allegro and Largo are two of my favorite characters -- delightful! Oh, yeah, and I liked Grant and Lauren, too -- and the younger sister whose name's slipped my mind. Harchar's made historical romantic fantasy one of my favorite new sub-genres. Can't wait to read more about the fairies!"
5,Great Deal - Great Shoes!,I always buy my Allen Edmonds shoes in Norstroms and are used to paying over $200 a pair. These are the same shoes and same quality for less than half price. Great deal! Thank you Amazon.
4,Satisfied Customer,"The book was in great condition, except that it was missing 20 pages. They weren't torn out, I think that they just were never put in. Hence, the 4 star rating instead of 5! The book also arrived within 4 days-very timely!"
3,Misleading title.,The title of this book has at the end MyMathLab Student Access kit. It does not come with that...the access code is for you to get into the my learning lab and it does not come with it. They really need to clarify.
3,"Good shape, but missing information",The book and CD were in good condition. Bought this for school. It wasn't a complete set though and had to buy the study guide too.
1,Beginning and intemediate Algebra plus mymathlab student access kit 4th edition,"The product takes to long to arrive, the vendor seems unreliable. You email enquirey and no one responds to say anything. Unless you are able to wait indefininately you may want to order somewhere else"
4,great purchase,I purchased this book and it got to me faster than I thought it wld. It had the cd's included and it has helped me. great purchase
3,Bought for girlfriend,I gave my old xbox 360 to my girlfriend and i bought this game to give to her with it and she played this the whole time until she got mass effect for it. It is fun to play and she thoroughly enjoyed it.
4,Addictive Family Fun,"I am 22 years old, I liked Animal Crossing, although I got bored with it, and if anyone who has played it knows, I always changed the time because I got impatient. I had a Wii for awhile and I loved playing the game ""The Sims"" but recently got rid of my Wii, so I got this game hoping that it would be similar. I really love this game!I love that its not too hard to get achievements, it doesn't discourage you. Time goes by soo fast, I have found myself playing this game for 5 hours straight. My boyfriend (who is 28, and in law school) will be on the computer and I see him staring at the screen while I am playing, and asking me about the different pinatas, and about my garden. I also love the freedom it gives you - its your garden to do whatever you want with it. Sure, you want to have a couple pinata houses, and stuff for them, but other then that its all you.Gotta go play!"
5,Tons of Fun,This is one of my all time favorite games! I'm 21 and I've been playing this game for over a year. The colors are so vibrant and the pinatas so much fun to collect! I can't wait for the sequel!
2,starts good ends bad,"im 16 and my sister is 15 so everyone knowswell, i rented viva pinata and i was excited at the most. i did have alot of fun in the beginning but as soo as you reach level 35(which takes around 11 hours of gameplay) it all goes down hill. at times the game is annoying because of all the bad things happening in your garden but it is fun managing and getting new pinatas. my sister also got bored and shes only level 20. i would tell anyone to RENT THIS GAME FIRST. it will save you 50$ of your hard earned money. im pretty sure a younger person such as 10 or under will NOT be able to understand the concept or be able to manage all that going on. so, all in all very fun for 10 hours, then not so fun. so glad i rented it!"
1,What am I missing?,"I was really excited to get this game after all of the reviews sounded so positive, plus I'm a huge fan of the sims and animal crossing which it's been compared to.I don't know if I'm missing something, but it's just not fun at all. Really repetitive, and I know people have said that it's better than animal crossing because Animal crossing was so repetitive, but at least there was strategy and a storyline. This is more like.. plant stuff, get your pinatas to hook up, build a house, plant stuff, get your pinatas to hook up, build a house.I really want to like it, and I really hope I'm missing something and it's going to miraculously get better as I go along but I don't know how much more I can take."
4,Great game for the whole family,Like Sims with a garden full of living Pinata. A lot to discover and uncover as well. This is really a genuinely excellent game. You can get some clues about what you can unlock from the TV series.
3,"If you want this game, get ""Viva Pinata: Trouble in Paradise"" instead.","Okay this is a good game, it's fun, I could sit and play for hours without getting bored. The problem is, it's not worth it to buy this game now that Viva Pinata: Trouble in Paradise is available. Trouble in Paradise streamlined the interface issues and added content, but it basically the same game. I found this out after I ordered both Viva Pinata and Trouble in Paradise and had to go through the hassle of changing my order. As it stands both games are about the same price so there's no reason to buy this title unless it's much cheaper than the Trouble in Paradise edition!"
3,Okay game..,"The game is okay, but from the reviews at IGN.com, I assumed it would be an absolutely amazing game. Not quite. Maybe it's just me but the game was a bit boring. The game pack included a short xbox live gold membership trial and an extra game disc that included two mini arcade games. The seller was great, shipped on time, low price, no problems with the disc. 5 stars for the seller, 2 stars for the game."
1,Could have been a really fun game,Well it was a fun game it would be even better if it was 2-4 player and the AI did not get stuck. I even said if it was 2 player it would be the best game ever. The one thing that made me stop playing was... well nothing really. Yea the doctor got stuck on nothing and all my Pinatas died and I quit playing the game. Another one also got stuck and it died and it could not be removed so I would have had a dead pinata there for the rest of the game. I would have been really good but no. My sister also had this stuck problem too. It ruined the game it would have been 5 stars. I don't know about the new one and I'm not going to buy a 360 for it.
5,Must be good,I said to my friend hey do you wanna borrow Fight Night Round 3 and Rainbow Six Vegas and ill borrow Viva Pinata and he said HELL NO! I acted like i was going to borrow it anyways when i was over at his house and he came running up stairs to see if i had it :)
3,for the times of trouble,whenever you feel down pull this game out and have fun with it. it is easy at first and relatively fun to play.
3,I expected greatness,"But got ok. The film is not too too bad--I like BET films, but I thought the film would be better. I'll keep it in the collection and watch it on those boring Saturday afternoons."
2,I could have saved my money.,I wanted to add to my BET movies on DVD collection. Waste of my money. Monica Calhoun and Khalil Kain just didn't have any chemistry with weak acting.
2,Largely unpractical,"I was disappointed. Interiors like these are for the most part unliveable, both because they are very limited in elements (60's or industrial, and some ethnics and florals) and unpractical. They also seem very contrived. No children in these rooms, please. And no pets either. For all the ""relaxed"" motto, I rather think these interiors would take more to upkeep than more traditional ones."
4,small,"This book was much smaller than I had expected. I still use it as intended though, as bathroom decor and reading. It looks nice there even though it was much smaller than expected."
4,"Attractive, Inspiring, Photographs","If you are looking for accessorizing inspiration, this is good little book. I bought it mainly for the photographs and drew information by noticing color combinations and decorative object placement. As with any decorating book, some ideas will please and some won't. The photographs are calming which is the point of the ""Relaxed Home."""
2,"Too much Ringma, not enough Bonhoeffer...","Since I appreciate the challenges that Dietrich Bonhoeffer offers to any of us who are brave enough to wade through his rather dense writing, I was excited to utilize ""Seize the Day with Dietrich Bonhoeffer"" as a daily devotional this year. But much to my surprise and chagrin, there is very little of Bonhoeffer in the book. Each day begins with a tiny snippet of Bonhoeffer's writing, followed by considerably more content from the compiler, Charles Ringma. Many days, the book includes literally only one sentence from Bonhoeffer. Though Ringma's thoughts were fine, they did not challenge and provoke me as Bonhoeffer does. And I didn't buy this book to hear from Charles Ringma. I wanted to hear from Dietrich Bonhoeffer. So, after a few months, I put down the book and do not plan to finish it. If you're looking for a substantive daily devotional from the pen of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, you'll have to keep looking, as his place in this one is far too limited."
5,Excellent for Personal Prayer,Charles Ringma's daily prayer reflections on the writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer are more than inspirational. They lead directly to a deeper understanding of God and God's mysterious working in one's life. This book is my daily companion.
1,The Awakening with Kevin Lowe,Total junk. I would not let my dog watch this movie. I do not know how these folks got anyone to film them.
5,just what I was looking for,"This rack is simple and sturdy. It has a lot of pegs, and is easy to install. I am very happy with this rack and may even purchase another."
4,"function ""A""; Form ""C+""","This works like a charm for storing my large & larger necklace collection. The piece was ""dinged"" upon arrival because it is not very well constructed--maybe veneer. OK+ for the price."
1,"For the very young. Too much ""drawing software"" emphasis.","According to the introduction, many of the activities in this book were developed using a kindergarten teacher's projects. I'm disappointed because the lesson plans are for the very young. I teach 2nd through 6th graders computer skills and I find almost all of these projects too easy/young for the students. This is probably best for Kingergarten through 2nd grade only. Also, almost all of the projects require drawing software or Kid Pix. I only found about 6 projects that didn't use drawing software and 2 required greeting card software and 1 required calendar creating software. There were only about 2 that used word processing, and they were very simple. There isn't a variety of ""everyday"" programs used like I've seen in other Teacher Created books. I wish I would have know the age level and the extreme ""drawing software"" emphasis before purchasing."
4,Computer Activities A-Z,Computer Activities A-Z is an excellent interactive book that helps teachers devise lesson plans related to the computer. Lessons are devised according to letters of the alphabet and can be used in conjunction with letter learning. Each project is set up for a primary user and is easy to navigate. The template CD includes examples and templates necessary for success. This book is informative and fun. I highly recommend it for classroom computer projects and activities.
1,Premier Rapidfold Desktop disappointment,"We are a dental business that has owned this paper folder since August of 2006. We have never been able to feed more than 10 sheets at a time (unlike the advertised 50) and most of the ones we do send through get wrinkled or do not get folded properly. Also, the tray to catch the papers just tosses them on the floor and they end up in bunches not separated. When I called tech support for the product I was told it wasn't designed to catch the papers and keep them in the tray (what do they think we want to do with them???). Even on the phone with tech support I it did not work properly and I was told it is just finicky."
3,ADJUST IT CORRECTLY,"THE PREMIER (MARTIN YALE) P7200 LETER FOLDER IS A LIGHT DUTY MACHINE CAPABLE OF FOLDING 500-600 LETTERS PER MONTH. WE BOUGHT ONE, IT LASTED ABOUT 3 YEARS. WE TREAT IT AS ESSENTIALLY A DISPOSABLE MACHINE. IT DOESN'T TAKE UP MUCH DESK SPACE.WARNING: IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE PAPER FEED GUIDES ARE PARALLEL. IF NOT, IT WILL CRUNCH UP THE LETTERS. BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU SET IT UP, READ THE DIRECTIONS, AND VERY FIRMLY TIGHTEN THE NUTS. THERE ARE BETTER MACHINES, BUT THEY COST A LOT OF MONEY.THE PREMIER ""THREE SHEET"" LETTER FOLDER (HAND FEED) IS A TOY."
1,didn't work properly,"bought this for a mailing of apx 1000 pieces... it seems to fold the first 7-8 sheets of a stack correctly, but then starts to jam up and folds the other sheets incorrectly, somewhat crooked. i can't rely on loading 8 sheets at a time, so i'm going to be returning this."
2,Tired of folding!,"For the price, it is a good machine. The metal rungs that catch the folded papers somtimes spills them out if there are too many and the folded papers sometimes slip inside each other. You can't set it and walk away--you do need to be there to avoid problems."
2,No So Happy with Product,"I wanted to use these to hold towels in the bathroom, however the adhesive doesn't stick that well and I had to screw them into the wall. The the end cap which holds the ""gripper"" part of the hook popped off and both the cap and gripper came off. I had to super glue the button on. Next time I will look for a different design."
4,Great part 2,This book makes you think a bit more than the others but still gives you the raw action we are used to. Well worth the read.
5,Beautiful and handy,I have been thru many cigarette cases and this one is so far my favorite. I am not a fan of the old fashioned pouch ones like my Grandmother used and I don't like a lot of frilly designs. This case is gorgeous and fits all my likes. I have received many compliments on it even from non-smokers.
3,"The 4.25"" mislead me!","The product was great, but was not the size I expected. It did not fit the cigarettes I smoke. I will have to give it to someone as a gift,"
5,Great cigarette case,I love this cigarette case because I have my cigarettes and lighter together at all times. The ell skin is so pretty and I love the color and the price is great.
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT !!,"""THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST BUT THE PRODUCT WAS DAMAGED THE METAL AREAS ARE ALL DISCOLORED AND SOME OF THE COLOR IS COMING OFF ON THE CASE IT SELF. THE FLAP IS VERY HARD TO OPEN AND CLOSE. JUST COMPLETELY NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT. """
2,FAR TOO SMALL,"I purchased and assembled this the other day, and i'm very disjointed. My neighbors are very nosy, and due to past altercation with the law i am now longer allowed to carry a firearm. I am very afraid of them coming to my house, and threatening my children with their voodoo. I set it up in the side yard, aimed at their horrible fortress, and readied it. this is where i was dissapointed. The kit was entirely too small for me to use effectively! I had spent all afternoon ordering my children to gather boulders for ammunition in my war effort, only to find the finished kit the size of head, roughly. It had no chance of successfully launching anything! Looks like my family gets to spend another night in the fallout shelter."
3,Pusher style model plane,"I chose this for it's relatively low price. I needed a pusher type rubber powered model & there were only 2 different ones to choose from. It arrived on time; was all there; & was as described in the ad. However one of the rather fragile foam wings was somewhat warped and creased, due to insuffuciently protective packaging. Flight characteristics are only fair, probably due to rather heavy fuselage, made from plywood."
5,Fun gift,Purchased for my 6 yr old grandson and 3 yr old brother!! They love it!! We launch marshmallows and other small items from the catapult.
4,Bob's boyish anticipations,"Just a simple toy to assemble and enjoy skimming across the pond. Incidentally, it works on flat snow too! Easy, fun, relaxing and easy to replicate; I can make several for the grandchildren. :-)"
4,Bought for my 10 year old son,"I bought this as a project to share with my 10 year old son. We put it together in less than half an hour (other than some time to let the glue dry). He had a blast, learned a lot, and was thrilled with the whole process. The kit was very easy to assemble."
3,fun but poor durability,"This is a fairly good little gadget. The long term durability is low, andnot a ton of educational value. recommed larger kits for kids education.still fun for office battles."
1,Political Lies,"I have a very similar cultural background to the author's. I also came from Japan twenty some years ago as a high school student. I feel a certain amount of empathy toward her because of my bicultural/bilingual background, but I really don't like the way she describes Japanese culture. It's too stereotypical and generalized. If you want to know anything about Japan, I would recommend ""Turning Japanese"" by David Mura. Although he is the third generation Japanese American, his views on Japan are fairer and contrary to Mori,he is very honest to himself.(I don't find Mori being honest when she claims she doesn't know how to write in Japanese after going through Japanese educational system for twelve years...which school did she attend in Japan? She lost her credibility just by saying this!)"
1,the half-empty glass,"""Polite Lies"" wanders back and forth between kvetching and bellyaching. Complaints stain nearly every page. When Kyoko Mori was married, she objected to people asking about the color of her living room. She explains that she and her husband wanted to do as little decorating as possible. Then on the next page she is complaining about ""our mismatched furniture"" and ""how bad our furniture was"". A full review could provide endless examples of grouchiness expressed in well-turned phrases.Mori's insistence on painting herself as a malcontent overwhelms her otherwise valuable insights as a resident and traveler in two cultures. And when Mori offers comments on literature, the book seems to begin breathing fresh air.Mori writes that as a child she was a picky eater. The tragedy is that this habit expanded until it drove nearly every aspect of her life."
4,Wonderful Insights,"This book was recommended to me by a colleague, and I really learned a great deal from it. I also learned something about why we ourselves do things we do--such as clutter up our homes. For the author, this was a way of achieving warmth in the home--something she never had as a child. I can apply that readily to my life and that of a close friend. Very interesting, particularly for those of us unfamiliar with Japanese family life and culture."
4,A brave book,"Having lived in western Japan, far from the more broad-minded society in Tokyo, I observed that the restrictions experienced by the women Mori describes are still true. Her book may seem delicately written only to those who don't realize how radical it is in Japanese society (and that includes those who live now in the US) to speak the unvarnished truth, to act authentically and to write unblushingly about one's inner turmoils rather than communicating according to formalized patterns."
4,Clear and Imaginative writing,I am an American who feels caught between two cultures-- though different from Kyoko. That is why I picked up this book. I read it on my trip from US to India enroute to settling there for two years. IT helped me a lot to arrange my thoughts and feelings. I could relate to many of the feelings she expressed. I highly recommend this book to anyone caught between two cultures-- especially two totally different cultures...
4,Putting a new light on the cultural difference,"I happened to have a similar background to the author's. (native Japanese but living in the State, the same generation) One customer's review is saying this is a hate speech, but I don't think so. Things the author pointed out are ultimately true, although most Japanese people won't notice as far as he/she is in the small circle (family or family-alike) The way the author did, initiating the argument from her own experience is tricky but I think she has succeeded. Better relationship always starting from better understanding. Hope this book provide better (profound) understanding of the difference. Although I'm very impressed with her work, this book is only dissecting deeper and deeper, which you may feel frustrated."
2,flawed,"I think the major flaw in Ms. Mori's book is that she is writing about a Japanese society that she is no longer part of. Imagine the gall of an American writer, who lived abroad for 20 years, trying to tell us all about American society.She makes statments that assume that Japan has remained frozen in time since she left.She also climbs a slippery slope. It is not that she is comparing apples to oranges, she is comparing apples still on the tree to 20 year old rotten oranges."
1,couldn't get past her negativity,"I just read the title at the library and picked it up, thinking it would be interesting to get her perspective. I grew up in the midwest and am now living in Japan. However, after reading the first chapter and the first page of the second chapter, I couldn't go on. She comes across as a strongly negative person who can find something to complain about everyone and everything. As other reviewers said, it's clear she hasn't gotten over her mother's death and distant relationships in childhood. With all the other books out there, I didn't want to waste time reading about one woman's baggage disguised as cultural commentary."
3,Well-written but flawed,"This book is similar to Alex Kerr's ""Dogs and Demons"" because you might consider it a revelation upon reading it. It may strike you as absolutely authoritative and the final word on the subject of women in Japan. It's very well-written but flawed. Like Mr. Kerr, it seems Ms. Mori set out to write a deeply pessimistic and profoundly negative book about Japan. Well, she accomplished that goal. The author must have a photographic memory because in the book she is able to reproduce conversations and events from long ago in extraordinary detail. Ms. Mori is also very persuasive, but don't let her do your thinking for you. Find out for yourself what is true and what is false. Japan, like most countries, is too complex to be uniformly condemned or praised. This book is worth reading, but take it with a grain of salt."
2,The extinct Japanese observed by a Lady Rip Van Winkle,"The cover design well matches the text.Very stereotypical. The Japanese,especially women, appear in the book have almost died out. It is extremely difficult to find a young lady who is a ribbon or lace wearer. The teenage magazines are full of sex, sex, sex. The ideal woman is a quiet wife?? Only the most conservative man's dream. The housewives no more stay at the dark kitchen, instead go out for the ""gourmet tour"" or study at those culture centers. The left behind is a poor husband. The Japanese society has changed a lot since the author left for the US. It is no wonder to find the context rather out-of-date, although I do admit the following sentence:""The system works well for people who feel no desire to rebel""."
