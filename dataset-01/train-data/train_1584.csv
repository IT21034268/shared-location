2,One Problem,"This is probably the most attractive case for the 6700, but there is a very strong magnet in the flap and it affects the screen and the data in the pda! Even bringing my pda/phone close to it made the screen flip around and turn the phone on without any touching. I had to return it, and lost my shipping money."
2,Verizon PPC 6700 and Cingular 8525 screen flips,"Like the previous person who reviewed this, me and a friend had the same problems with this case unfortunately. It seems to be a known issues in all types of devices that have the slide out keyboards. Apparently the magnet ""triggers"" the phone to go into landscape mode. They claim there is no data loss, but I would not be willing to risk it.I am sure the case is fine, but I find it bothersome that these cases are advertised to work with these phones."
1,ITEM SUCKS,THIS PRODUCT REALLY SUCKS THE BELT CLIP FELL APART AND I DID NOT HAVE THE ITEM NO MORE THAN 2 WEEKS..SO PLEASE DONT BUY THIS ITEM
1,Not a leather case,"When I first got this I loved it, but beware. This is artificial leather and it falls apart within a few months.I would NOT recommend this, spend the extra money on getting a REAL leather one."
1,not very sturdy,I only had the case for 2 weeks and it's already torn at the clip. The description said the case is leather. The leather is fake and I have to go and find another case again.
1,Poor Quality,"The case fits my Tilt good and is easy to use. But the quality is pretty poor, so know what you get for this price."
1,Keep Looking,"Totally misrepresented. It does not fit. I Bought this case for a Palm Treo 755p. According to the ad, it is indicated for this model.IT IS NOT.The case will not close, the magnets will not engage. If I try to pull the phone out of the case while it is on my belt, the whole case comes off, and it takes 2 hands to pry the phone out of the case. It is unuseable for the purpose for which I purchased it. I will keep looking, for a case made by Palm, specifically for this phone."
1,Cheap imitation leather - false advertising,"First of all this is not a leather pouch as it is advertised. It is cheap plastic. Also the area around the belt clip is extremely weak and after the 2nd time I pulled the pouch off of my belt, the clip ripped from the pouch on 3 sides."
3,Its OK,"It does the job, but is hard to get the phone out and can not hold the phone in it when charging, that stinks. But it looks great and protects my phone which is why I bought it."
4,Nice looking leather HTC 8525 belt holder,This belt holder for the 8525 (AT+T) and other devices is a nice looking black exterior with tan interior leather. Goes with pretty much anything you wear and protects the phone nicely. Its not to tight on the phone so its easy to remove. My only complaint is that the flap opens upwards which can make it hard to work if you are wearing a coat or sweater.
2,nice but not the best,"It looks really nice and I would love to say I like it but... it is too tight, my treo has to be squeezed into and half the time it pushes against the buttons. I regret that I have to say this because it was a good price for a pretty product, but well didnt turn out as I had hoped."
2,pretty but......,"Good design but .... Please don't waste U$1.99 on it! Now, i'm carring my 8525 in my pocket!"
2,Nice case - as long as you don't have to remove it from your belt,"I really liked this case, until I noticed that it was tearing at the clamp from taking it off of my belt. And this tearing occured after about 3 weeks of use."
5,great,"Blue Bloods: The Second Season My wife loves it. I'm not into it, but if it makes her happy so am I"
5,Terrific Show,"I love this show, especially Donnie Wahlberg and Tom Selleck. It is a great show about a family of cops and i love how it shows that the world is not so black and white when it comes to doing the right thing."
5,LOVE IT!!,"Bit hard to go wrong with Tom Selleck but entire cast works so well together. Now have both seasons and do watch many times, finding things I didn't notice before. For me, near must have"
5,Love this show!,"A great crime drama, but made better by the family element which is what makes it stand out among all the crime shows. The cases are important, but the characters make the whole thing more interesting. Amazing acting by Donnie Wahlberg, Bridget Moynahan, and of course Tom Selleck."
4,blue bloods the second season,we liked it quite well. the discs were in good shape and we are ready to buy the next set.
3,All episodes were as we remember them with the exception of the last two on disk 5,I chose this rating because disk 5 has a flaw in it in the last two episodes on that disc do not play correctly. We loved the episodes that we were able to view but as I mentioned above we disliked it because this number five has some problems. We were about to contact someone when we saw this review and are wondering if you could supply us with a new number five disc. Yes we would recommend this product because we enjoy the programs very much and let people know we watch them. As an afterthought we would have given it a five star rating if all the discs worked as they did when we purchased the first season of bluebloods.
1,Not enough Room,"We purchased 4 of these. There is simply not enough room, even if you purchase separately, longer screws, to insert a proper turkey gobbler tail. Even after paring down the tail there still was not enough room. We are going to request a refund. This is cheaply made by people who are supposed to be experts. Very disappointing."
3,Allen company turkey tail mounting kit,"We liked the kit and it was easy to use. However, the screws to hold the plate over the tail in the back were too short so we had to find other screws to hold the tail on."
1,Junk,"This plaque arrived different than the picture shown. It is not a hardwood plaque, but a processed board with very bad veneer. I ordered two and both of them were scratched through the veneer upon delivery. They looked terrible so I returned them. I won't be ordering another cheap Chinese plaque over the internet. I'm going to pay double and get a real wood plaque made in the USA. I figure I have spent thousands on hunting, so why am I going to show off my trophy with a terrible looking plaque. Also, I don't see how you can mount a tail fan even with longer screws. There is no clearance between the ""wood"" pieces."
1,"Any button turns PS3 on, ANNOYING!!!!","The remote is fine other than the absolutely frustrating fact that the stupid remote turns the PS3 on if any button is pressed on the remote. Okay so whats the big deal? Because its so easy to accidently hit a button because the buttons are so sensitive. Everytime I sit on the couch, or clean the living room, I somehow end up hitting the remote and turning the PS3 system on. So then someone, not paying attention, turns the PS3 on by hitting the remote, they leave the room and then the PS3 is left on ALL DAY! NOT GOOD! I hate the feature, just give me one red button playstation, I think we can all be smart enough to find it. The remote is down right annoying."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"You can do everything on your game controller that you can on here. It takes about one half hour to learn the controlls on the game controller, but you can do everything right there. Why have another big remote cluttering up your coffee table area? Just use your top button (I think the triangle) and then go to menu-then hit triangle again and go right to all the secial features. It is really a snap and works fine. The movie remote does NOT turn on the PS3, so you will have to grab your controller anyways for that. A waste of space."
1,Unnecessary Remote,Save your money. This remote is not very user-friendly. The controller that comes with the PS3 works just fine.
2,No backlight!,"I actually like this remote in terms of layout and functionality (and bluetooth is nice actually since you don't need to point it at the PS3), but not having it backlit was a terrible decision by Sony. For $25 they can't even put in a light so you can see which tiny button you're pressing while you're watching your (decidedly unimpressive) blu-ray movie?!"
1,Worst remote ever!!!!,"Remote is too sensitive plus it has no dedicated ""Power"" button. What kind of crappy remote has no power button. Plus, any button turns the PS3 on, making mistakes often, then you just can't turn it off, you have to wait for the stupid thing to boot, then either watch the screen to turn it off, or try to time it. Pain in the rear for sure. Anyways, I was consent to live w/ these setbacks, but then the stupid thing stopped working after about a year. Tried to re-pair w/ bluetooth to no avail. In anger, I smashed it against the wall. Looks a lot better now. Hahahahahah! By the way, I hate the PS3 too. Mine broke and they wanted to charge me $150 to fix. I smashed that against the wall too."
2,Stop-button irritates,"Works OK, but I'm hugely irritated by one thing: while the button which takes you to the game console menu politely asks you if you really want to stop playback, the Stop button (the one with a square on it) simply stops it, no going back.If you press it, then you have to start the player up again, you have to sit through *all* the menus and disclaimers and warnings, language selections, logos, graphics candy and general BS, and *then* you have to navigate to the last place you played, because the machine does not remember it (why not, Sony? My DVD player remembers).*And* the Stop button is right between the Play and the Pause buttons! I've pressed it several times by accident."
2,Awful button labelling,"I guess the only flaw i see (or can't see)with this remote , is the fact that the button labels are so tiny and dull , you cannot see them.Even if you have the best vision , you cannot view the labels without a really bright light (and i am not exaggerating)it sort of defeats the whole purpose of a remote , which is not to get up!...other than THAT!it works fine"
3,nothing special,"Nothing special about this remote.I only bought it so that I could use it to program a universal learning remote if need be and to have a back up remote when the controller battery is recharging. I really prefer the game controller with it's on-screen display.If this had lit buttons or better stand out buttons, then I could give it better than average (3) stars. Plus, it is really cheesy of Sony to not have ir on the PS3. At least with this remote (over the controller) you can easily replace the batteries."
3,Good but could be better,"This remote is much better than using a game controller to watch movies, but there are a couple major improvements that would help it.1. You can't turn off the PS3 with one button - you have to navigate through the menus or just walk over and turn it off.2. The fast forward/reverse and the skip buttons are difficult to distinguish in the dark. A little back-lighting would help.3. The response time is kinda slow. You may think it didn't register your pause button push before it finally pauses a few seconds later - probably a Bluetooth thing.We still use it all the time when watching movies, but it would be nice if there was another option."
3,Functional but Mediocre,"This remote is useful for DVD/Blu-Ray playback, but for the price and the brand name, the quality of this product should have been higher.Pros:- Nicely shaped and balanced- Bluetooth-based, which is a huge improvement over IR-based remoteCons:- Poor ergonomics: no backlit buttons, no glow-in-dark for button labels, no braille-like bumps to help identify the buttons by feel in the dark.- Further, buttons are packed very close to one another, which make it easy to reach with a thumb, but also make it very easy to press the wrong button(s)- ""Stop"" button is inexplicably sandwiched tightly between the ""Play"" and ""Pause"" buttons, making it very easy to press ""stop"" button by error.During Sony's glory days (the ""Trinitron"" era), its remotes were the paragon of ergonomic design and functional elegance. Sony has done a great job with PS3, but this remote falls short in design and execution."
4,My Excalibur of movie viewing.,"This is a seriously solid remote. It's handsomely designed with a glossy finish that matches the PS3 console nicely, and it feels very sturdy in your hand. The bluetooth technology ensures that you're never going to have to deal with a blocked signal again, either. It's got all the buttons you'll need for navigating the cross media bar and Blu-Ray / DVD menus.The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it's not a universal remote, meaning that you can't turn on your TV or adjust the volume with it. However, my guess is that in the future we'll be seeing some bluetooth-enabled programmable remotes, so it doesn't really matter. If you must control your whole media center from one device, then hopefully you won't mind waiting a bit longer. In the meantime, this is a very solid single-purpose remote, and it's a must have for any PS3 owner!"
5,Kind of a no-brainer,"Well, if you ever watch DVD's on your PS3, then you probably want this. It is a full-featured DVD remote just like you'd get with a standalone DVD player. It lets you control the PS3 Media X-Bar in general - you probably won't be using it to play games, but for controlling your PS3 as a media center, it's hard to beat."
2,Like a brick with a sharp edged top.,"Given the choice between no remote and this remote, I will still use this one, but it feels like a brick in my hand. Poor to no ergonomic design when in to this. They could learn a great deal from tivo. The button layout is also poor given how much research went in to the PS controller you would think some thought would have gone in to this remotes layout. The biggest problem is the stop button between the play and pause button. That added to the fact that Bluray will not resume were you left off after you hit stop make this an unforgivable flaw."
4,So far so good,Works fine though to be honest we haven't tried all the features yet. Will try to update...
5,Thank goodness...,"....for this remote. Using the controllers was so annoying for playing movies, but this thing works great. I only wish it had a plain old 'off/on' button instead of the PS button. Otherwise, I love this thing."
5,This remote is the BOMB in my opinion,"Just paired up the Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote I just boughtand I was amazed at how easy it was to navigate. Put on my Seinfeld SeriesDVD and it was up and running. The Blu-Ray (Seinfeld Series are done in Blu-Ray from Sony) was astounding. My hubby & I couldn't get over the quality, color, details, etc that PS3 displayed. The remote was the icing on the cake. Would I recommend this remote to someone with PS3 ..ABSOLUTELY"
3,Good but with some flaws,"I love this remote but it has one problem with it. If you even push hardly any of the buttons by setting it down and any of the buttons depress it turns on the dang PS3 when you do not want it to. Overall it is a good remote I just wished it would of been better designed. There are a ton of buttons on this thing and it takes a while to try and learn them all. This is not necessarily a bad thing. More options the better, just be prepared to sit down and learn it and keep it away from things hitting it like stacking remotes or setting it upside down."
4,Very Handy When You Use PS3 To Play DVDs or Blu-Ray Discs,"We got this remote after our regular DVD player broke. Instead of buying a new one, we decided to use the PS3 for playing all our DVDs. However, both my husband and I had trouble using the PS3 controller for control the movies. This remote serves that purpose beautifully. We only use it for this reason so I can't really comment on the other features it has. It was easy to set up ... even the ""non technical"" person in our house could set it up. If you are looking for a remote to better control movies you play in your PS3, look no further."
2,Dead batteries,"Remote control arrived as expected. Initially I thought it was broken, but turns out the batteries were dead right out of the box. Put a new set in and it seems to be functioning ok now."
5,Useful,Very useful! Not only for movie toggling at ease but also for tooling round in ps3 menus when the controllers are charging.
2,never go to work,we never could get the remote to operate the ps 3 but don't know if it is operator error or bad remote
4,Works Great...and there is a power button,"I finally got this remote and I am writing this review to point out that the PS3 can be turned off and on with the remote very easily. In the middle of the remote there is the Playstation Logo button, like on the controllers, that will turn the PS3 on with no problems. To turn it off just hold down that button and it gives you a menu to turn off the console...easy as that.Overall this remote works perfectly fine. It does what it is meant to do and I actually like the fact that it is bluetooth because it doesn't have to be pointing at the PS3 to function."
4,A good peripheral,"This remote is not strictly necessary, as the Blu-Ray player works fine with the ""Sixaxis"" PS3 controller.But because the controller is not entirely intuitive, and because we use the PS3 as a Blu-Ray and DVD player, the remote is awfully helpful--especially for my wife, who has no interest in or facility with a video game controller!"
3,"Could and Should be Better, but a PS3 Must Have","If you have a PS3, you have to have it.Pros: It's infinitely better for controlling DVD and BD than the PS3 six-axis controller; Bluetooth instead of infrared technology means you don't have to point the remote at the system (granted, no different from the six-axis there.)Cons: Bluetooth instead of infrared means your PS3 is not compatible with universal remotes (for now, until universal remotes catch up); no back light on the remote, which is the real disappointment."
4,PS3 Remote control,"I like this remotecontrol, but misses the glow in the dark feature.I recently found this site on the web [...]It looks interesting! this might solve the problem with the black buttons on black background."
5,Great Product,I was kinda worried about what some of the other reviews said about if you hit a button it will turn the system on.. it does do that but I keep the remote next the the PS3 out if the way so I dont have to worry about it. it would be nice to have it be back lit but overall I would recomend this product
4,Works as any remote should,"Once you get this, you have to register it with your PS3 through the settings menu, and the on-screen instruction are simple to follow. After its register it works fine, press any button and the PS3 will turn on. This was better than playing around with the controller for blu-ray movies, and its easier for browsing through the PS3 store and the web browser than the controller is."
4,Nice alternative the the controller,"I love being able to navigate the Xross bar with one hand. I use this extensively to play my video files from my NAS and it works flawlessly. Bluetooth does not require you to point at the screen, but I am already trained to do so.Only thing is that I wish it had a backlight - tough to see in the dark and the key layout is such that you can't easily feel your way to the buttons. The Verizon and Comcast remotes are well designed for this."
3,Yep. It's a Remote Control.,"The PS3 remote control uses Bluetooth, which means you don't have to point it at the system for it to work, but it also runs through batteries a bit faster than your standard TV remote. You'll probably need to replace or recharge its AA's every 6 months or so, depending on use. Also, even though many of the buttons feature the traditional PS3 controller symbols, the remote only works for media playback, not games.Other than that, it's a standard remote control. Works as advertised."
4,Good product.,Overall it`s a good product. It woud be better if it had a on/off button. Sometimes you`re listening to music and you have your screen off so when you want to turn off the system you need to turn on your screen to see what`s happening and follow the instructions to turn it off.
4,Pleased,"It is functional and has decent value.The remote made it easier for me to navigate the DVD/Bluray movies by making it more intuitive. In other words, I didn't have to think about which buttons on the controller command which action. I guess I am lazy that way.If this remote had backlighting it would have received 5 stars. But I suppose over time knowing what buttons you want to push in the dark will become intuitive as well..."
5,awesome,"Great remote, easy set up. its alot easier than having the ps3 controller with u at all times."
5,PS3 Remote,This is very handy to have if you're going to use the PS3 to play blue ray movies. Using it is much easier than navigating with the game controller. I highly recommend this remote.
4,Hard to see buttons in a dark room,"Overall it gets the job done, nice and simple. Only complaint is it's hard to see the buttons when watching a movie in a dark room and I wish Sony would open the bluetooth code so other manufacturers could make a universal remote. I HATE ALL THE REMOTES LAYING AROUND."
4,"Great Remote, but Pause button in Wrong Place!","This makes the PS3 feel like a high end Blue-Ray player. It is nice that you do not have to aim the remote at the PS3, like for infrared controllers. One thing that dries me crazy is that the Pause and Stop buttons should be swapped. You know how frustrating it is to accidentally hit stop, which boots you completely out of the disk where you need to wade through all the startup stuff again before you can continue watching the movie? ARRRGGGGHHHH!!!"
4,works great as controller replacement,"Not much to say, it works great to replace using a PS3 controller to navigate the menus. Wish it was a multifunction remote to control my other devices."
2,BIG NEGATIVE - No Back Light,"-If you watch movies in the dark there is no back light. Absolutely terrible oversight!-The buttons are in an unexpected order. They go Play, Stop, Pause instead of Play, Pause, Stop. Hitting stop on accident will ruin your night, trust me.-The buttons also go Scan, PREV/Next then slow-mo. I would expect PREV/Next, then Scan, then slow-mo.-Any button turns on your PS3. Why not only the PS button?! Turn on the PS3 on accident all the time...+ Bluetooth, so sight lines don't matter which is cool. Wish my other remotes were like this.It's a remote and it works, not rocket science. It's better than using the dual shock 3, but I wouldn't buy it again unless they added a back light! That's 4 minus and one plus. The lack of the back light is my biggest complaint."
3,Sony PS3 Remote Control,Pros: Allows you to play Blu Ray movies with the PS3 easilyCons: Turns on the PS3 by pushing any button accidentallyHard to set up - took me four tries (and I'm an electronics tech).Instructions confusing
5,Remote,"What can you say... it's a remote. I prefer it to the controller. Otherwise it's like any other remote. I recommend it if you are particular and want a remote by your side, otherwise a controller does fine."
5,A must have for Playstation owners,This remote control is essential for those who use the playstation 3 as a movie player.
3,One button missing!,"I bought this remote with the PS3, knowing fully well that I would use it more than the gaming remote. After all, I bought the PS3 primarily for the Blu Ray player; the game console function was sort of a freebie.Anyway, although pressing any button on the remote turns the PS3 on, there isn't any ""off"" button! You have to walk over to the machine and hold down the on/off switch for a few seconds to shut it down. How lame is that?Not only that, but activating the remote itself requires more than simply slotting the batteries. I had to actually READ THE DIRECTIONS to figure out how to get it to communicate with the PS3. That said, however, the bluetooth functionality (once you get it working) is pretty cool. No longer do you have to aim for the IR sensor. This sucker will work around corners, and maybe even through walls (in the unlikely event of that need arising)."
5,I wish all remotes used bluetooth technology,"The remote is great. Has a great reception, actually far batter that I expected with regular IF remotes, why? Bluetooth baby!!!! It does not matter where I'm pointing the remote (And I even tried from another room too) it the PS3 still detects the command from the remote. Its crazy. Battery life is very good too. I love it!!"
3,very friendly. but try to get it for less,"This is only for those who are not gamers or not acquainted w/ using the standard PS3 wireless DualShock remote, and for its purpose, this remote is a friend, which is highly arguable when one much rather uses the Dualshock. Nearly a four-star rating, to me. Moreover, this remote is more appealing if you can get it for less than $17. Setting (via the playstation 3 on-screen) is more or less easy, sort of. It comes w/ the same buttons as those on the Dualshock but added w/ much more DVDplayer type of buttons & control. Note that the Dualshock might cost twice as much."
5,Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,This PS3 Remote is a MUST get remote for your PS3 console. It is very useful and great item for your PS3 console.
5,remote works and has all the right features,Nice remote works well has all the right features including turning on and off the system. I believe that this is the only remote that we can use with the PS3. Simply put we have no other choice but I believe that it is better than most DVD remotes.
4,Good but pricey,"First this is way better then the old PS2 remote. Since it is Bluetooth, its range is 30-50ft and through walls. Good built quality and fairly good buttons size and locations. Highly response so I use it for the xbl slider sometime. I had no problem registering this device. The PS button worked the same as on the controller as an on/off button.Issues:A-B and repeat options are not on the layout, you still have to use the submenu, triangle button.$25 for a single emote is high for not being universal.What with the R3, L3, red, green, purple, yellow buttons which I have not found any use for. The keys Backlight would be nice too.I watch a lot of Blu-ray, so after awhile the PS3 controller was not very comfortable so I got this."
4,Great Remote Control for PS3,"I have been using the Sony PS3 Blu Ray Disc Remote for over a year now. Very solid and dependable. Great functionality. Buttons are a little small for my fingers but a minor annoyance.The major thing I wish is that it had backlit buttons for those times when watching a dark movie with all the lights off. (Gotta watch those horror and deep space movies in the dark on the large screen HDTV.) It is easy to hit the wrong button in the dark. With backlighting this remote would get a solid 5 star rating! Sony, you listening?"
5,This is sooooo handy,It's a remote -- you need it to work. The blue tooth technology really makes it work great. This is just what you need. I find I use it to navigate the PS3 menu and for the Blu-Ray player.
4,good but not great,"nice range, cant see buttons in dark, wish it could control other devices so i wouldnt have to have multiple remotes"
3,"Fine, but why Bluetooth?","OK, it works fine as a remote and you could have forced me to pay more because it is Bluetooth- but why use Bluetooth at all?I have a great Logitech universal remote that is useless on the PS3. Did you really need another $19 out of me? Was a $0.25 IR receiver really too much to include in a $500 box?Anyway, if you use the PS3 for DVDs (or even as a lousy interface MP3 player), you'll want this remote. You'll look like a dork using your Sixaxis watching a movie with a date otherwise."
3,nice Blu-Ray remote,"Bluetooth remotes are handy because they don't have to be pointed at the device. In fact, the device doesn't have to be in the same room to operate with the remote!The buttons are laid out fine, but the PS3 just doesn't seem to be designed with a remote like this in mind. There's no power button on the remote, so to turn the system on and off the PS button has to be used, just like the controller. Also, when the stop button is pressed the movie stops and goes back to the XMB (PS3's ""dashboard""). And there's no backlighting on the remote, so in a dim room it's hard to tell the difference between the fast forward and skip buttons.All in all, I wish the PS3 had Infrared support so I could just program it with a universal remote... but this is an acceptable second choice. It is nice to have a remote that does everything the controller does and is clearly labeled.I wonder what the colored buttons do...?"
1,Broken after a year,"Two gripes, very quickly:- This remote broke after a year. It was used perhaps three times.- It took quite a set of experiments to determine that it was broken. Why? IT HAS NO POWER LIGHT.For God's sake."
2,Blue-tooth is not good for remotes,"Not a good pruduct. If you bump a button the PS3 turns on. If you set it down and bump it, it messes with play back."
1,I've had two.....,"I've had two and each broke after I dropped it ONCEon my hard wood floor. This was in the first monthof ownership for the remote.Great control when it works, but fragile.Build quality leaves much to be desired."
1,ridiculous and thoughtlessly designed,"I regret squandering the purchase price of this abhorrently designed remote, and gave it away immediately.The idea of a bluetooth remote is excellent, but the implementation here is something I regret having naively supported economically:there's no excuse for the user-aggressive button layout,there's no excuse for the lack of illumination,there's no excuse for a simple bluetooth remote being HUGE (no hyperbole...check the dimensions),there's no excuse for the dangerous plastic in which it comes sealed, requiring sharp scissors,there's no excuse for the ugly plastic of which it is made.It is strange that the brilliant PS3 doesn't have a more functional and well designed remote."
5,Blu-Ray Remote-PS3,"This is one of the best products ever released for a video game system. The PS3 is by far the most advanced and feature-rich game system on the market today, shrinking the X-box 360 and leaving it in its dust!If there is to be one problem to be found with the Blu-ray remote it is that it does not have a back light! This can make it very difficult to use at night, especially since it has ALOT of buttons!Other than that I reccomned this to anyone with a PS3 that likes to use thier system to watch Blu-rays or regular DVD's."
3,Just What I Needed,"This product - through Amazon, was not sent due to the fact they didn't have anymore. Got reimbursed. Purchased it elsewhere and just what I needed. Wasn't as easy as I thought. You have to configure it on your PS3 so that it recognizes the remote."
5,caution...,"You MUST go into your PS3 menu and find settings. Then, register or ""sync"" your new remote with PS3. It will find it because the remote is using Blu-tooth.Other than that, wish the remote had a background light. Not good in dark settings."
4,Another short- fall for Sony,"Sony! What were you thinking! First off this remote does everything like the reviews say. But how are you going to control a movie in the dark with out the buttons lighting up. The dont even use ""glow in the dark"" printing. I went to the Sony store in my area and complained to a worker they just said that even the Sony 350 Blue Ray player doesnt have a light up remote. I know everyone is going for simple but it is agrivating."
3,No Luck Remote,So far I have been unable to mate the remote to my PS3. I have followed the steps carefully according to the poorly written instructions and havehad no success.
4,Nice!,"Much better than using a controller. The only ""fault"" that bugs me is the ""stop"" button location. 3 or 4 times now i have inadvertently accidentally stopped the DVD/Bluray, meaning to ""un-pause"". Bluetooth is great!Sure, backlit buttons would be nice, as would a real on/off button, but the subtitle and audio buttons are worth the hassles, and it was only $20. Happy camper here."
5,Great remote,Exactly what I was hoping for when I bought this remote. Works perfectly and the buttons are laid out very well. I would recommend it to everyone doing any blu-ray watching on their ps3.
5,Great Remote,"This is a very handy option for the PlayStation. If you are going to watch movies this is a must. Once I paired it with the PlayStation it has worked great ever since.My favorit feature is the dispaly button, it lets you know how long the movie is and how far you are currently in to the movie as well as chapter, resolution etc.With this remote using bluetooth you don't have to point it at the PlayStation for it to work, you can almost point it in any direction and the thing still works."
3,just ok,"As a person who is utilizing the blu-ray player in their PS3 I wanted a remote because controlling a movie with the standard controller just annoys me.This remote does the trick however the buttons are placed in bad areas. You often hit stop instead of pause or play and it doesn't restart the movie right where you left off...you have to go through the menu.With today's technology and Sony being a lead contender I am overall unhappy with this remote, it should have 1 of 2 things1). glow in the dark buttons for the main buttonsor2). a glow in the dark button that you push and it lights up the entire remote so you can see the buttons.Most people do watch movies IN THE DARK! I am shock Sony doesn't realize this and I'm shocked they haven't redesigned...if they ever do redesign for my like I would purchase that one...which is a double sale for them...It does the trick but it is tricky to use..."
5,Great Product,"Very easy set-up, user-friendly interface, and doesn't have that cheap ""I'm going to break this if I drop it once"" feel. Overall, a great product and I recommend it highly."
3,Seems great but not very useful for me,"some review says you will not realize how useful it is until you get it.For me, it is not true.Comparing to using the controller, it is harder for me to locate the button i want.Controller assign the functions to each button so naturally that you do not need to remember. Besides, as you hold it in your hand, you can easily locate any button without moving your eyes off the screen.I wonder why others like the remote. I don't find it useful."
3,Great Blue-tooth Remote,"Works just fine, but take note... does not work straight out of the box. You must activate first it with your PS3. It is simple to do in the settings menu.READ YOUR MANUAL!"
3,Easy to use but hard to set up,"The blu-ray disc remote is great once its set up, but setup is no simple task. First of all, instructions are confusing. There are two buttons which need to be pressed together, 'start' and 'enter'. Trick is that the 'enter' button (as explained in the manual for the remote) is the 'x' button. There is another 'enter' button in the middle of the d-pad which is actually labeled 'enter' and is the correct one. You have to use that 'enter'. The second challenge is that this remote may fail to pair if the regular wireless 'sixaxis' remote is also in use (esp by wireless) at the same time. Apparently there can be enough interference to cause issues. Turning the regular remote off and then doing the 'dual-button' push did the trick finally.Once paired, it's awfully nice to have a 'regular' remote for viewing disks...."
3,Works as advertised,"But... it doesn't lit up. What the h..? If you're watching a movie, which is what the people who buy this product do, and the lights are off, you'd have to rely a lot on your tactile sensation. Otherwise, it works great! No line of sight is needed since it's Bluetooth."
4,Nice remote,This is a very nice remote though it is a little touchy and causes the PS3 to be turned on with the slitest drop or touch.
3,Could have been better,"Overall it's a good remote, it has everything you need to watch movies easier, including frame by frame button. My only gripe with it is that the control pad (up, down, left, right buttons) seems to stick after only a few months of use."
5,perfect for Blu-ray,I'm so lazy and I watch blu-rays with my PS3 this remote helps with the laziness part.We started watching a lot of Blu-Rays when there was ll that hype about them... this remote is great for PS3/Blu-Ray watching.
4,Works as advertised,More responsive than USB based product I used previously. Also has much more functionality. I wish you could power off the PS3 from the remote.
4,Must Have if you use PS3 for Bluray or DVD,"Highly recommend this remote if you plan on watching Blu-ray or DVD videos using your PS3. Great price on Amazon with no tax and free shipping. The remote can also be used to navigate videos, music, internet, etc. using your PS3 (which only does everything). Remote is easy to to sync with your console. I wish I would have bought this remote a year earlier."
2,"DOA out of the box, terrible layout, use controller instead!","Remote did not work at all out of the box. Tried 3 new sets of batteries (Energizer Alkaline 1.5V, Eneloop Rechargable 1.2V, Rayovac 1.5V) the remote was completely deader than a doornail. In trying to get it to work, I looked over the layout of the buttons and didn't really see a point to using it when the controller appears to be able to do everything the remote can do, with the exception of entering in numbers, but when am I ever going to need to do that? I recommend you just save your money unless your dying to have another remote laying on the couch."
5,.PS3 remote,I love this remote. It works well and you can use it without pointing it straight at the system
5,for the lazy and the willing!,"well this is a piece of equipment that is just for those of use that want to treat the ps3 as a blu ray player rather than a fantastic videogame machine. it makes the experience of the blu ray player more like what you would expect than having to use the ps3 controller, which has all the options on it, but is still harder to read and maneuver"
2,Could be much better,"There are serious problems with this remote:* Keys are placed in non intuitive locations; even the most important ones (play, stop, pause) are located in a completely illogical order (not to mention back/forward chapter and fast/slow scan). As a result, it is nearly impossible to use the remote in the dark, unless you memorize the position of several buttons. Consider that I also often use the ""languages"", the ""subtitles"" and the ""display"" buttons. I don't understand how Sony can have achieved to engineer something like this, with several good examples of remotes on the market (even by Sony itself!) they could have easily copied.* The batteries last very short. My first batteries lasted just 4-5 months. The batteries on my TV IR remotes, always by Sony, normally last 3-4 years or more.That said, it is much better to control the blu ray discs with this toy than with the Sixaxis."
4,Works as described - Remote and as a PS3 controller,Great product. My batteries don't drain as fast as what others claim - maybe I don;t use it as a controller much.Works great as a remote should! Highly recommended if you own a PS3!
4,PS3 Remote Control Review,"With the PS3's main function as a game console, you wouldn't think of it needing a remote control. And you would be right if you thought that. And as a Blu-ray player, the remote control would come in handy, not that the game controller wouldn't work, it would just take a couple more steps to navigate through a DVD/Bluray disc like you'd expect a DVD Player or Blu-ray player to. If you can bear the extra steps, the game controller would suffice. But if you'd like to cut to the chase, like me, this remote is what you'll need."
4,PS3 Remote,"The blue tooth portion of this remote works great. Not having to use line of sight is a wonderful addition. However this doesn't work well in most home theaters. Blue tooth isn't compatible with most home theater gear. I also don't understand why Sony chose not to add backlighting to what could have been a wonderful experience. Typically when using this remote, you will be viewing a movie in a dark environment, not having backlighting seem like a bad design choice. Otherwise it works as advertised."
4,Great remote except for two flaws,"The Sony PS3 remote is great -- nice button placement and feel (although that's subjective), and since it uses Bluetooth to communicate with the PS3, line of sight isn't required! That's a long-overdue feature for all remotes, because it lets you operate devices in cabinets and you don't have to point the remote at the device.The flaws:1) The DVD remote has no IR emitter so it can't control anything except the PS3. While I wasn't expecting a universal remote, it would have been nice if it could at least change the volume on my Sony receiver and/or my Sony TV.2) No backlight. I can live with that, once my fingers learn the button placement. But I've squinted at it a few times.All in all, it's worth the money. I hope Sony (or Logitech) takes heed and comes out with another remote that does it all."
3,Below average product,"First, the clamshell package that this item was wrapped in is particularly nasty. A blowtorch or a chainsaw are the appropriate tools to open it. I ended up using a heavy duty cable cutter to get to the pearl inside.The remote paired easily and worked fine. It delivers the functionality it promises, although not elegantly.1) It is thicker than most remotes. So when you hold it in one hand and press the buttons with your thumb, your hand tires quickly (in a few seconds) while trying to keep hold of the remote. My hands are of average male size.2) There are too many buttons and most are too small for comfort. Most of the buttons are used rarely, if ever.3) The navigation pad (the one in the middle encircling the Enter button) does not work with the Web Browser, so you still need to have the game pad around, for a complete Media Center experience."
3,Prehistoric remote control.,"Sure, it works most of the time although it's far for being a perfect device, but I needed it so not much other options for the same money.The obsolete design makes this un-operable in the darkness. Not up to the nowadays standards ofusage and esthetic..."
3,Useful and it has lots of buttons,"I got this remote because I don't like cheap MadCatz style remotes. I want a genuine actual remote that evokes feeling and comfort with me. This very such remote does that and so much more. My one complaint is it has 957 buttons on it. I use about 6 buttons all together so I have no idea what the remaining 951 buttons are for. It is comforting to know they are there, but I wish I know what to do with them. I would have loved for the Play, Pause and Stop buttons to have different shapes and maybe be in different spots on the controller.Pairing it with PS3 is easy and simple and if you transfer your data from one PS3 to another, the remote pairing transfers as well. Do yourself a favor and pick this up right quick."
2,Sony cutting corners again,"The functions on the remote are fine, but that's not rocket science anymore.The overall manufacturing quality of this unit is on the low end, not what you would expect from Sony, though this seems to be a trend with Sony products in the past few years. It lacks any visual indicator that the remote if functioning (like a small light indicating that a button has been pressed). So, you may find yourself troubleshooting whether it is syncing to the unit correctly, is low on batteries, or has some other problem.In my case, it's been a series of ""has some other problem"". In the past, reseating the battery has made it work sometimes. But now it's failing to work altogether, leaving me to use a PS3 controller to control blu-ray discs (which is annoying).I can't say if it's a pattern with these units, however, as I've only tried one."
1,PS3 Remote,"I purchased this for my husband because as most people we use the PS3 as a bluray player rather than a video game console. He was very pleased with this remote, only wished it had an on/off button to be able to shut down the console. I rated this low because it's not a game."
1,PS3 Needs a IR Remote Reciver.,The PS3 needs to have a IR remote reciver so I can use my Logitech Harmony remote. What's the use of having one remote to do everything if the PS3 still needs a separate remote?
1,PS3 Blu Ray Remote,"After getting the PS3 and loving it, i bought all the accessories. And was VERY dissapointed.Along with the fact my wife almost killed me for buying the PS3, she could not understand how the unit cost so much, and did not come with a remote!!!!!!!!The remote does not turn PS3 on and off!!!"
1,Blu-Ray troubles,Have tried 2 different PS3 DVD remotes + 2 PS3's and still can't get remotes to register with system.
3,"Functional, but not phenomenal","Fist of all, I'm a little annoyed that I needed to buy a new remote to have some features unavailable on the Sixaxis. I'm also annoyed that it was incompatible with my current Logitech Harmony 880. But, on the other hand, I didn't want another dongle on the front of my PS3.I do like the fact I don't have to point it in any particular direction, but still find myself pointing it at the TV. Hard habits are hard to break, I guess. The added functionality of the buttons are handy (e.g the Stop button takes you completely out of the movie and back to the XMB without asking you if you're sure).My biggest gripe, perhaps I'm spoiled, is that the remote doesn't light up; nor are the buttons shaped much different from the ones next to them. Navigating in the dark is a pain. I don't use the remote enough to fully memorize the precise location of the pop-up menu button, for example. I suppose, in time, this will change as I become more familiar with the device."
3,Big remote that is basically just a controller,"The size of this remove is too big. Sony used a very large design for some reason. This remove also doesn't offer anything over a controller, although it is a very nice convenience tool if you are used to a remote and not a controller. Only spend the money if you have it to spare."
4,Must have for PS3,"This is a terrific remote, BUT I just wish the placement of the pause and stop buttons was switched. A backlight and power button would've been nice as well"
1,Stopped wroking,The remote worked for about 9 months. Sony products are usually well made. In particular PS3 is fantastic. But this remote did not last and it was not overused at all.
2,Nice remote but...,"Whatever possessed Sony to make a bluetooth remote?! Controllers I can understand but remote? You cannot program your tv, amp, dvd, or any other infrared remote. As well as program your infrared remote to learn this remotes codes. At least as far as I know. So as far as having a remote for your PS3 yeah it works but better have your tv remote handy if you want to adjust the volume, switch inputs, etc.Why they couldn't add IR to the PS3 is beyond me. Maye with the PS4 :D"
1,Died just outside of warranty,"I purchased this remote in February 2010, and it completely stopped working in March 2011. I don't think I've ever had a remote control die on me. It lived in an adult household (I'm 43), and was nothing but well-taken care of. To the best of my recollection, it wasn't even dropped once. It was used minimally, to watch Blu-ray movies on my PS3. That was once, twice, *maybe* three times a week. I wish there were other options for my PS3, because there is no way I'm buying another one.My biggest gripes with it have been covered in other reviews here -- The fact that any button will turn the PS3 on (which I solved by storing the remote next to the PS3 itself), and the placement of the ""stop"" button, which by pressing it takes you clear out to the Playstation's main menu. As annoying as these issues were, I could live with them so long as the remote actually worked."
2,"Gets the job done, but that's about it...","An extremely tedious controller, if their ever was one: button placement is lousy, there is no back-light, and if you press ANY of the overly-sensitive buttons on this controller, it powers on the PS3 (as I am reminded over and over...).Unfortunately, if you intend on using your PS3 as a DVD/BluRay player, then this is a fairly essential purchase, but only because it is literally the only game in town. Almost no universal remotes will work on the PS3, due to its Bluetooth-only wireless capabilities."
2,Why make a remote with no backlight?,"At the fundamental level this remote works.However, certain design flaws hurt its usability. The lack of backlight is a huge usability issue. Unless you are watching with lights on, you can't see the buttons! The lack of a power-off button is major omission, as well. I really can't figure out why this was left out. While I am not happy that the PS3 does not natively support an IR remote, that's a complaint about the PS3, and not about this remote. If it were an IR remote, however, I could teach the commands to my universal, and I wouldn't care about the backlighting issue..."
3,The Controller is easier to use then this is,The title speaks for itself. You don't need this to accomplish any fucntions of the PS3. The remote works just fine.
2,Great remote until it stopped working,"This was a great remote control for two and a quarter years -- and then it stopped working. Buttons started to not work every time and, eventually, stopped working entirely. Fresh batteries fixed nothing. Very disappointing."
4,NO KEYPAD ILLUMINATION,"I am mostly pleased with this PS3 Remote however, One area Sony could have worked on was including an illumination device for the keypad. A Remote device such as this is used in very dark Theater applications requires backlit keys and the lack of keypad Illumination is a serious problem when one wishes to make changes to the PS3 player and or the Movie being watched.D.S.RighelloRancho Cordova, CA"
5,The best of all options!,"I tried a couple other IR remotes but the PS3 didn't like them and they became more of a hassle than they were worth. Thankfully I saved all the packaging and they will make good Xmas gifts for friends this year. What can you say, it's Sony equipment so you know it's the real deal."
2,What were they thinking?,"Why does this remote use different op codes for the same functions as the game playing remote? for some functions, you have to use the gaming remote because of this. An engineering faux pau"
4,Great for Netflix,It so much nicer to use a remote with Netflix through the PS3 over a controller and this remote works perfectly for that. Would be nice if an all in one remote would work with the PS3 but since its bluetooth this is the best option
4,Great remote; I only wish it had IR.,"The remote is great and a must have for Blu-ray viewing. However, I wanted to control the PS3 using my Harmony One remote so had to get the Nyko IR remote and use the USB dongle. It is definitely not as slick to use as the blu-ray remote and I have to have the blu ray remote on the table to turn the PS3 on and off from a distance."
3,You dont really need it.....trust me,"The remote works great....but unless you always want to use the 'special features' on a DVD/Blu-ray disc you will NOT need this remote. I bought it 'just because' having a remote for the PS3 sounded like a good idea, since all my other audio/video components have remotes as well. Now that I have this, I realize how much of a waste of money this was. Unless you are constantly stoppping or viewing alternate camera angles, you wont need this remote, just use the regular ps3 controller to start and stop the movies..."
3,Works well but not so good design,"Pros:-Works well in 13ft+ long distance.-No line of sight required. Uses radio waves (bluetooth)-Works well, no glitchesCons:-Not practical for web browsing-Hard to use in dark. Most buttons are nearly identical shape and size, hard to distinguish by touch.Conclusion:-If you use PS3 as your primary DVD player, you must buy it, but don't expect more than that."
4,So annoying when you sit on it,While the blutooth is awesome it's so annoying when we accidentally push a button and it turns on the PS3. It's great to hijak the remote and screw with someone using the playstation in the other room. Yay blutooth!
5,Works Great,I bought the Blu-ray remote control mainly because I got a great deal on it. I think I paid 20 bucks for it and it came with Hancock on Blu-ray so 20 bucks for the remote control and a movie isn't that bad in my opinion. I now love having this because when I'm charging my ps3 controllers I can just use this for when I'm using netflix and its really easy on batteries too I think I have gone through maybe 2 sets since buying it and thats been over a one year span so 6 months a sets not to bad.
5,Great Remote,"great remote, work awesome, ideal for everyday use, it is very helpful and useful, great deal for that price, it is worth it"
4,Works like a remote is supposed to !!!,The PS3 controller would be hard to operate for my wife so got to this. Works well while watching movies. The colored buttons haven't been useful yet. They could've done without them and couple of other ones for sure.Overall works well with the PlayStation.
5,Playstation Remote for Watching Blue Ray Movies,"For those of you who have kids that grab the PS3 controller when you want to watch a movie, this is the controller for you. It looks and duplicates a NORMAL remote in every way, so even parents can use it comfortably. Take control of your Blue Ray movies on YOUR PS3. Your kids will be upset, but they're teenagers, it's OK.Also, the instruction manual that come with it for setting up the Bluetooth function are clear and concise. The Bluetooth is how the remote sees the PS3. The PS3 uses bluetooth, instead of infrared, is why you can't program your other remotes for your PS3.The faceplate functions are clear and easy to find. I only use the basic ones to watch movies, but they are well layed out and I don't double hit buttons. Overall, everything I expected it to be at an affordable price. As usual, Amazon delivered it pronto."
4,Owww,I was tired of turning off my system everytime at the back button. Never more! And I can control my blue ray films too!
3,Can live without it,"I'm Not sure why I got this controller. I suppose it was an impulse buy more than anything else. It doesn't really do anything that the regular controller doesn't do, it just looks different. The controller is wireless, too, so it's not like you get any extra portability. It serves it's purpose and works great, but as long as you have a controller you really don't need this."
4,Great Product but NO Directions,"Bottom line is that this product works great and is totally worth the money if you're someone who uses the PS3 for Bluray movies often. However, one small criticism. The remote does not come with any instructions, leading one to believe that once you put the batteries in, you're good to go. Not the case. You must go to the PS3 settings screen and register the remote (an easy process, mind you) before it will work properly. Why Sony doesnt put this bit of information in with the remote is beyond me. Just a helpful hint for those out there who are going to buy this item."
2,Most frustrating piece of equipment I ever bought.,"The only reason I didn't give this one star was because it does work well for everything it's supposed to do except that it's so damned sensitive. If I accidentally bump any of the buttons it will turn my PS3 on. I contacted Sony's pathetic technical support, but they weren't able to offer me any help. There are no settings to adjust sensitivity or to assign just one button the function of turning the PS3 on and/or off. I may end up throwing the remote out and selling the PS3 in disgust and boycotting all Sony products as a result. That they offered no viable solution to my problem is unacceptable, and they don't deserve my hard-earned cash."
1,Refurbished beware,"Make sure your remote is not refurbished like mine was, chances are it will only work for a while then be useless. Mine lasted 6 months, and I barely used it."
4,Much better option than the controller.,"This item does what you expect it to do! I only gave it a four because I wish that I could use my harmony remote with my PS3.However, this remote is still a better option than using the remote to control movies. I always got frustrated by having to turn the controller off and on and sometime I would hit the R2 or L2 button on accident causing the movie to skip.This remote is always on and always connected. It's not expensive and worth it for anyone who uses their PS3 for Blu-Ray movies (or upscaled DVD's) as much as I do!By the way, its very easy to connect to your PS3. Simply select register PS3 remote on your PS3 and then hold the start and select buttons on your remote at the same time. Violla! Your done, and your remote is always connected.You can also use the remote to control the XMB (cross media bar) and turn the console on and off!"
3,Its ok.,This remote is nice that you dont have to aim it at an IR point. It also allows you to navigate the ps3 menu without turning on a controller which is nice if you just want to navigate tot he store and download things. This way the PS3 controller isnt buring the battery.The only down side is that if you touch any button on this remote it turns on the PS3. This is pretty lame for someone like me that keeps remotes in a little basket that are touching each other. Twice now I have found my PS3 on burning power for who knows how long.
3,Its an okay remote but a bit busy and bluetooth,Personally I thought this remote was done okay. It is a bit busy with way to many buttons but I suppose some people may actually need them all. It would be nice also if the PS3 could handle a normal universal remote instead of a BT version since some of us like to have one central remote for it all.
5,Best Remote Yet!!!,"I bought this remote to use with my PS3, so that I wouldn't have to use my Sixaxis to control movies. This remote is actually the best DVD remote I have seen for any player. Buttons are layed out and organized nicely. It's not a universal, but if you use your PS3 for Blu Ray discs, or even DVD's (if your like me and decide to use the PS3 as your primary player) you can't go wrong."
4,Good for Netflix and BluRay but Sony TV remote does the same,If you like Netflix and BluRay you will appreciate one of these. Its much easier to use then then the stanadrd ps3 contorller for those tasks.However after I purchaed this remote I discovered that when I hook my PS3 by HDMI to my Sony Bravia TV the TV's remote can control Netflix and BluRay too. And it has volume control unlike the PS3 remote. So if you are using a recently made Sony TV you might want to experiment before deciding to buy this remote too.
3,Frustrated,"Okay so the remote works great, it's light on batteries and blah blah but every time it gets touched the PS3 comes on. It's on 24/7 I would have thought BT would be cool for a remote but it sucks or they need to make this so not every button turns it on."
4,You may have problems getting this remote to initially connect.,"I have enjoyed having the remote and would buy it again but it was frustrating to get working.The remote must be initially connected (paired) to the PS3 which should be a very easy process. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Based on my internet research, most people don't have a problem with the initial connection but more than a few do have a difficult time. I tried all the tips on the PS3 websites but none of the advice helped. However, I just kept trying to connect the unit and on about the 15th attempt (it seemed like a lot more) the unit finally connected. Since then it is just the thing to have to watch DVDs and internet TV.If you buy this remote be prepared to spend some time getting it working and don't give up."
3,Good but could be better,This could be so much better if they would make a small change to it. I read the reivews on this and saw several people mentioning they did not like it because it did not have backlit buttons. I thought it would not be a big deal. Well now I have it and I see why it is a big deal. This remote is black and the buttons are black.I was talking to some friends who have it and they said they have to have PS3 find the connect to it constantly. They say it is such a pain that they would rather use their game controller. I have not experienced this yet but I have not had it that long.I love the Bluetooth. It is great that you do not have to make sure you are pointing the remote directly to the PS3. I wished they would make every device be able to use a Bluetooth remote. I may start thinking differently if I start having the PS3 find the Bluetooth.
2,Falls Short,"As others stated, this is one busy remote. There are more buttons on it than a remote for a complex stereo system. I also do not like how it takes pressing a button twice because the remote has to wake up first. Plus with no button pushing indicator light, you cannot tell if what you did worked or not.A must have? No, I do not think it is a must have. A ""would be ok to have"" is better terminology. Hopefully a third party remote will come along that is a little better than this. It did some with Sony batteries, so it is nice you do not have to buy those right away.If you have the money to get this, do so. You can live with it. If money is tight, use it to buy another controller. Yes, not as pleasant as a remote, but a controller has more uses with a PS3 obvioulsy."
1,Remote is not well made!!! Such a rif off,Bought this remote in Dec and now in June it just stops working!!! Thought it was the battery but oh no!! And amazon wants to give me a partial refund!!!? This is ridiculous!!!
2,no backlight is a non starter,this is by far the hardest remote ever to use in the dark. even in the light it is confusing. but in the dark or semi dark it's unusable.
2,Lacks power off button,"Nice bluetooth remote does not need to have line of sight to the console to control it. So now you can place your console out of sight in a cabinet. Sony added the ""handy"" feature of allowing the remote to turn on the PS3 by pushing ANY remote button. Hmmm, now imagine a curious child getting hold of it, or it accidentally getting pressed while you move it. Add the fact that it actually has NO power button, so you are unable to remotely power down your PS3 without going thorough the system menu, or memorizing the key sequence to blindly power down without the TV on. (Hold down the PS3 button, and click OK twice). To simply power down the PS3, you need to touch and hold the console power sensor for a couple of seconds.Some frustration happening here?Call me lazy, but isn't that why we like remote controllers to begin with?"
1,Frustrating remote,"I purchased a PS3 because it was the most affordable BlueRay player on market at the time. As players go, it's not bad. But this remote is sub-par. It eats through batteries and with no back-light you can't see the buttons in my home theater. I actually have a small flashlight next to remote so that I don't have to turn on the lights. The only reason to buy this remote is that it's your only option. And since Sony chooses to use Bluetooth instead of IR, you're stuck with it!"
5,Great remote,I convinced my husband to buy this along with our ps3. It is a lot easier to use than the ps3 controller itself (in my opinion). It is just like a regular remote. Great buy too. I got it on sale. If you like to watch movies on your ps3 this is a must have.
5,Goes well with PS3,"Accessory to go with PS3. I don't play games much, So I needed this to be able to run the PS3 to watch blu-ray movies."
5,Must have if you're using the PS3 to watch Blu-ray,"I originally bought the PS3 specifically for watching Blu-ray movies. Trying to navigate through a movie with the PS3 controller is a nightmare. I then purchased a cheap remote that turned out to be worse than the controller, and wound up being thrown into the trash. Finally I got the Sony remote. It does a real good job. It makes the PS3 feel like a real Blu-ray player, not a game console that plays Blu-ray. It makes navigating through the menus, etc. a breeze. For $20 shipped, every PS3 owner should have this."
5,Very cool remote,"Just thought I would post a quick review for this remote. Although I knew that this remote was blue-ray technology I didn't think about it due to years of normal remotes, but this remote is cool because you don't have to point it at your system. Yes I know that is a DUH comment for plenty of people, but I think for the person who doesn't know much about how technology works that it is a pretty cool thing to know. It is bigger than the old ps2 remote, I wish it was a lot smaller. However I imagine this does a lot more. I don't use this remote for anything other than watching movies on my system but it's great for that. Responds well, looks nice, had no problems setting it up with my system. A good buy, I will however mention look for it online because I found mine much cheaper than in stores."
5,Good remote,"I'm very pleased with the remote. I think it should have been packaged with the PS3, but no point nit picking what didn't happen. It works as a remote should with easy of use, intuitive button locations, and most importantly (to me) a POWER ON and OFF switch for the PS3. No more manual PS2 power button. Woot! The bluetooth feature is really cool. Now that I know (in my head) what the PS3 menu looks like, I can change the music selection from anywhere in my house with this remote. I rather like that. No more line of sight required!"
2,Too complex and no added value,"Although I love Sony, the Playstation, and Sony products, I fail to see the value in this device. It seems like a waste of money. Basically, you can perform the same functions with the controller. It is too complex for those people who cannot use the controller. So I do not really get the point of it. Plus, a lot of functions you would like to see it perform are not arranged in a logical fashion. I would skip this and just use the controller. For people who cannot master the use of the controller, this remote is too complex."
3,Not very fast and user friendly,"Somehow, pressing the playstation button on the remote to turn on the PS3 causes the link between the two to malfunction. I have had to re-register the remote with the system more than a couple of times. Using any other button to power up is ok.After some time that you don't use the remote while watching movies, the connection goes in a sort of sleep mode and it takes a second or two for your button press to actually take effect."
3,Good for movie night,"Good remote, just wish it lit up like most modern controllers so you can see buttons in the dark when watching a movie."
5,Great!,Paid less for a new one here than at any store...even with shipping charges it was less. I love the remote. Have had no problems and I use if often.
4,"adequate bluetooth remote, but not RF","This remote is easier and more intuitive than the controller. I also used to have the controller get bumped and that would skip the chapter/ffd/rwd...something unintended. The remote helps with that.I wish that there was a bluetooth/RF adapter that would allow me to use my universal remote with my PS3. It is annoying to have multiple remotes. Until then, this bluetooth remote is adequate."
4,Regular DVD/BD remote control feel for PS3,"I ended up purchasing this PS3 remote that works like a regular DVD remote that we are used to. PS3 system comes with a Game remote controller that can very well be used to play DVD/BD/Games and the Sony X-BAR menu. It took a while for me to get used to the game controller to use it for DVD/BD operations.This remote controller helps to alleviate all those issues. Very easy to setup and use. Now I can easily use it to control all the DVD and BD operations. But, to browse the internet on PS3, the game controller should be used for zooming and mouse operations.Good buy if you intend to use PS3 as your primary DVD/BD player."
4,CHANGE THE BATTERIES!,"The remote is awesome (see aforementioned reviews), but the batteries that came with my remote were DOA, so it took me a little while to figure out that that was the reason why my PS3 couldn't initially register it. Change 'em. Avoid stress."
3,"well, it was only 20 bucks...","The PS3 remote is definitely not a ""must have"" gadget. It's mediocre at best, but it serves the simple purpose of not having to fumble around with the game control console to view Blu-ray on the PS3, which I hated doing."
2,missing ONE thing,"basically its your average remote that works well and is way better than trying to use the ps3 control to navigate your blu-ray movies BUT i have one complaint: where the heck is the power button????? a remote without a power button? really??? to power down your ps3 you have to use the ps button and navigate the menu to get to the power down system option just like with the gaming control, while not a total pain a power button would have been MUCH easier. its like having to get out of your car and open the trunk to turn off the motor. there is an eject button (which to me makes no sense being on a remote since you have to get up to grab said ejected disc) but no power button?!? why is it that any remote i have ever owned for any piece of electronics (to include my fan, REALLY lazy i know) had this strange piece of technology called an on/off function? its the only thing holding back this otherwise decent remote."
3,You need something to make it a better Blu-Ray movie player,"One of the main reasons we got the PS3 was to play Blu-Ray movie disks. While it is possible to run it from one of the wireless game controllers, asking everyone who walks in the house to learn what the buttons mean for playing DVD's is too much. This remote at least provides familiar symbols for play/pause etc. The only disadvantage so far is that it is the only RF (Bluetooth) device in my entertainment center, so it won't work with my Logitech Universal IR remote. (Not really the controller's fault, it's just the way the PS3 is designed.) Maybe I should have considered one of the IR/PS3 adapters?"
3,"Cute, but stiff","I really liked these shoes. They are very cute, however, they are kind of stiff/hard. I wish they were a little softer. They are narrow in the toes and the heel scratched my foot a little."
5,Wonderful,"This book was originally given to me, and within a few hours of having the book, I was on-line ordering a few more copies from Amazon.com to buy as gifts for friends. This book is a wonderfully, uplifting book. Full of positive affirmations that you can read and learn from. Here is a small example of what the book entails; ""When I begin to work on myself, sometimes things get worse before they get better. It is okay if this happens, because I know that it's the beginning of the process. It's untangling old threads. I just flow with it. It takes time and effort to learn what I need to learn. I don't demand instant change. Impatience is only resistance to learning. I let myslf do it step by step. It will get easier as I go along."" I don't think you will be disappointed it you buy this book."
4,An enjoyable lost piece of the 80s pop pie,"Better known for being a member of Ian Dury & The Blockheads, Charles ""Chaz"" Jankel's solo output is enjoyable if not groundbreaking. Jankel himself is no outstanding vocalist, but the songs are catchy and fun, with a strong period flavor, particularly the sugary, Culture Club-ish synthesizer arrangements, and the slow, haunting ""Eastern Light"" is an interesting selection. If you love that overly stylized type of production that was prevalent in the 80s, then this is a great album for you."
2,Blatant rip-off of a great album.,"This CD really had a lot of promise and could have been just great. In fact when I popped it in my CD player it started out great. From reading the liner notes I already knew that the last track was also to be found on another compilation album, Arabesque. That album BTW is a must for almost any music collection. It turns out however that no less then four of the ten tracks of ""Mystic Groove"", all on the last half of the CD, are lifted straight out of ""Arabesque"". It would have been so easy to replace those tracks by different ones from the same fabulous artists. So, to make a long story short, save your mon and buy the much better and longer ""Arabesque"" instead. Don't support this blatant rip-off."
2,Under-produced electronica,"I bought this CD because it had a track with Goze - Sirocco, I loved that track from the Kelly Slate Surfing game.Unfortunately, this CD suffers from the Buddha Bar/Chill Out/<insert compilation name here> syndrome.One or two tracks are good, but you wonder where they found the other 10 tracks, (or that whole 2nd CD in some cases).Mystic Groove is supposed to take place in a commercialized mid-Eastern Electronica World.The gee-whiz factor wears off quite quickly.Most tracks on this CD are plain under-produced electronica. That's a bad combination, because it means a sounds and samples repeated just too much.There's gotta be better compilations out there, and the only good thing from this one is that I'm searching for other, better ones."
1,Horrible book,"This book is mandatory for college classes (at least mine), but it was near impossible to get into the book. Not interesting in the least and NOT written for the common student. Don't recommend anyone purchases this book."
1,Waste of money,"I have bipolar disorder and read many books on the subject. After reading some of the reviews and the description of the book, I had high hopes. I am always looking for literature to help my family, friends, and relationships understand what it means to have bipolar, and to help them understand what they see me go through.I struggled to read this book. It was boring and only brushed the surface of the disorder. The book also reads like a high school text book; I felt as if there should have been a test at the end of every chapter.This book may be helpful to some, but I found it did not go deeply into what people really need to know to understand and the disorder and help their loved ones with it."
2,Overrated.,"I can't understand why this book is considered the ""go-to"" book for bipolar. There's a lot of filler, and the chapter on depression is ridiculous: Do more fun things! Except of course, things aren't exactly ""fun"" if you're seriously depressed. I also don't think it's very helpful in enabling people to recognize the onset of a BP episode. I completely agree with Jecca's review; ""Break the Bipolar Cycle"", while not perfect, is a MUCH better book."
2,An ultra-beginner book,"I bought this book soon after being diagnosed as bipolar. I was disappointed in the book because it revealed little new information. The information contained in the book can be found online on many reliable websites, such as nami.org. I guess this book may be okay for the friend or family member of the bipolar person as an intro to the disease."
5,A Must Read - Excellent!,"I am the webowner of Bipolar Disorder Today and have the bipolar disorder myself. This book contains excellent material with self management information, etiology, diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder.?Up to date information. I recommend this for consumers and familes. Good stuff!"
1,Not enough actual information,"There are too many examples of individuals experiences and not actual information. I would recommend ""Break the Bipolar Cycle"" by Brondolo and Amador."
5,"Fabulous, practical and well written","I have read a few publications on bi-polar disorder and this is the best book by far written to help someone with bi-polar disorder understand and manage their disease. It reviews symptoms and characteristics of both mania and depression, discusses in depth pharmaceuticals and what each is prescribed for whether anti-depressant or anti-psychotic etc. Just very well written so that it is easy to understand and engaging."
2,The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide,"This is an excellent informational resource for those who have little to no knowledge of bipolar disorder. However, in many respects this referrence minimizes the severity of the illness and oversimplifies the complexities of the disease. Much attention is given to ""mood charting"" which is an untested theory that has proven to be a futile waste of time in my own personal experience with bipolar disorder. Since the ""moods"" of bipolar disorder do not follow any predictable pattern (e.g. the sine curve), ""mood charting"" is of little benefit. Furthermore, and even more alarming, this reference presupposes that the sufferer can self-diagnose their own ""mood"" state at any given moment. Nothing could be further from the truth. The patient would be better off seeking the assistance of a voodoo priestess."
2,"Obviously a ""sponsored"" book","I bought this book, and I also purchased it for a friend, she's read more of the book than I have, but this book was obviously sponsored or funded by a pharmaceutical company b/c they suggest like 2 specific medications. I hate when bi polar books suggest specific medications. The most common Bi Polar medications did NOT work for me. It took 2 years to find the perfect set of medications for me."
4,Good Book,"I got this book, along with 2 others on the subject of Bipolar Disorder. I liked this book. It was informative without being too technical and offered lots of information and suggestions. I just hope I can get my husband to read it!"
2,Best Book on Bipolar Illness,"I'm very disappointed to not see Dr. Fieve's book entitled ""MoodSwing"" on the list of books for this illness. It is truly one of the best out there."
5,forget the poor grammar you WILL make and preserve a fortune.,"It took 26 years for me to make REAL money in my account and i attribute this success to having followed the two rules repeated in this book and shared by the 5 greatest investors profiled. Along with the online edition of Investor's Business Daily i was able to resurrect a failed wall street career and regain a sense of independence along with an incredible return on my stock portfolio this past year. Buy this book and keep it near somewhere on your desk. Finally you will understand how to make and preserve your capital and those funds entrusted to you.Furthermore you will find the two rules so simple to enact and explain. Thank G-d this book found its way to me and to the author, John Boik my most heartfelt appreciation."
3,Brief intro to top stock traders,"This book looks at five historically successful stock investors -- Loeb, Baruch, Darvas, Livermore and O'Neil. The book looks at each of these individual's approaches to trading and you'll discover that they are very similar. They all believe in cutting loses short, buying at new highs rather than buying a stock because it's ""cheap."" Boik examines and summarizes their strategies or rules for trading. The book is a good introduction to these traders' ideas. If you want to learn more about each of these traders' methods in depth, fortunately each have written their own books."
2,"Fancy title, weak content","Although it mentions many of the traders I respect, I found the book to be written at an eighth grade level with a lot of redundant information (filler). I can say this because I have read the main works that this book claims to distill, and Boik's book falls short of my expectations. I would stay away from this one and read the main works. You will learn a lot more and save your money."
4,Lessons from the Greatest stock traders of all time,"This book is very easy to read. It describes the top rules of the disciplined, successful investors in a simple way. Not too much details. good book."
5,Learn how the greats did it,"This book gives you a great introduction to strategies that made 5 of the greatest investors in history a lot of money. I truly find Jesse Livermore, Nicolas Darvas and William O'Neil to be the most interesting but this book covers all of them.I went on to read How I made 2 Million in the Stock market by Darvas, Reminissences of a Stock Operator and How to Make Money in Stocks by O'Neil, but this book gives you a good overview of the systems these greats used.It's a pretty quick read and it will get you thinking in a different direction."
4,Informative,This is a must read book for beginners since it gives a little bit ofbackground and history of the greatest traders.
2,"Skip this, read the originals","I gave this two stars because if you read it, you won't completely have wasted your time. As others have mentioned, it isn't well written. He speaks in generalities about the first four great investors, and I'm fairly certain there are paragraphs copy/pasted from one chapter to the next. Very repetitive. The only one of the four the author seems to have done any actual research on is William O'Neil, and Mr. O'Neil has several books available that are much better and give way more detail in how to actually carry out the strategies.I'm glad I read the little book because it led me to this excellent book, but I really wish I had skipped it and went straight to the sources."
5,Great bake ware,These are the best I use the 13by 9 most and it is great for anything.the other two are good also great product................
4,Good starter set for new apartment,Got this for my daughter who just got a new apartment and needed kitchen equipment. Everyone needs this set. She was so delighted!
1,STILL WAITING !@?%,"I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A GOOD REVIEW, BUT I NEVER RECEIVED MY ITEMS. I AM STILL LOOKING FOR IT. I HAVE NOTIFIED THE SELLER AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE REQUESTED THAT THE PYREX BAKWARE 4-PIECE SET BE REMAILED TO ME BUT ALAST NO PRODUCT. SORRY BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL BE USING AMAZON ANY MORE. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I REALLY REALLY WANT THAT SET. I'D BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR A LONG TIME. OH WELL!!!"
3,An OK album,"The only memorable song from this album is A HEART IN NEW YORK by Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle. This album was released around the spring or summer of 1981. Art Garfunkel performed AHINY live while recording THE CONCERT IN CENTRAL PARK with Paul Simon in 1981. Before the performance,Garfunkel tells the audience that the song was one of the very few that wasn't composed by Simon. The other songs are OK."
2,Very Poor Song Selection,"Art has always had a difficult time choosing quality songs for his great voice and this album is no exception. It has no great songs (most of Art's albums have at least 1 or 2) and a couple of ok songs (A Heart In New York, So Easy To Begin, Can't Turn My heart Away) but the rest are very forgettable and VERY boring. That is the risk you take with all Art's albums (except Breakaway) -- they can be very uneven and boring in general, with little melody to differentiate many of the songs. The songs Scissors Cut and In Cars are HORRIBLE and unlistenable! Get ""Breakaway"" first, and then if you like that pick up Fate for Breakfast or a Best of collection -- ""Garfunkel"" or ""Simply the Best"" (Import) are the best choices available. His new collection ""The Singer"" has way way way too many poor selections and drags. Better yet get a Simon & Garfunkel album!"
3,Works Well Enough For My Purpose,I grow my own wheat grass and I bought this for the sprouting. It fits on my mason jar a little too tightly but it fits. The holes are very small so the water doesn't run in or out very quickly but I can deal with it. It's cheap and it works and if you have the patience to let the water trickle in then this a good enough product for you.
3,Holes Too Small for Chia Seeds,"This lid fits perfectly on a large mouth jar. At first I was glad to see the holes were smaller which is a benefit when sprouting smaller seeds... but...The problem is that the holes are too small and once it is screwed onto a jar, water does not pour out easily. I tried sprouting only 1 tablespoon of chia seeds with this lid. The chia seeds form a gelatin-like exterior while germinating which blocked the already small holes that prevented water from flowing out freely. I needed to shake the jar vigorously for several minutes to get the water to drain. Being that sprouting requires rinsing the seeds twice a day, this lid makes the process time consuming."
3,Lid doesn't fit my canning jars,The product itself was in good shape. However this lid doesn't fit ANY of my canning jars. So now if I want to use it I will have to go find different canning jars.
1,Holes too small,"This item requires a lot of patience to drain. Holes are too small, and once sprouts develop, it takes forever to drain."
2,If the lid don't fit ...,Not a standard size. I have yet to find a jar on which it will fit. I have tried everything around the house.
1,not easy for making sprouts with this lid,"The holes on mine (I bought three) are fine for pouring water out of the jar, however you have to unscrew the lid each time to add water for rinsing the seeds (twice a day). This defeats my purpose of having bought a lid like this, which was to make it simple to add water right through the screen and then pour out again, all in one action.So I definitely do not recommend buying this screen if you want an easy method for making sprouts--I suggest looking for one that allows water to be poured in for rinsing while the lid is on."
1,Garbage-Does not fit!,Don't waste your money on this...it did not fit as advertised ....poor quality all the way around... ... ... ...
3,It works..,"But like a lot of reviews, it does drain poorly. I need to tilt it at a 45 to drain properly but, it's inexpensive."
4,Nice But,"These are nice and work as intended. But the holes in the lid top are large enough for a fruit fly (and 100 of his friends) to squeeze through. Maybe you don't have fruit flies in your house. Maybe you do, like me. Personally I have not been freaked out too much by this, but I did cut some squares of cheese cloth to put under the lids. So I'm back to cheese cloth. So what did I buy these for? Well, I didn't know about the fruit fly issue. Nobody told me. So now you know."
5,Not just for sprouts,"I love items that can be used for more than one purpose. This is one of those items.And if used right, it is awesome for sprouting the smallest seeds. Have had none of the problems the low star reviewers wrote about. I add the seeds, rinse, drain, and set aside to sprout. Morning and evening I allow fresh water to go inside without removing the lid, shake lightly and then simply pour the water out. Yes, I sometimes have to make sure I shake any sprouts that may remain in the openings, to remove them. But it's not rocket science.But...I also use this when I make yogurt cheese. I make European and Greek yogurt in a Mason jar and when I want to drain to make a yogurt style cream cheese I put this lid on, and turn upside down on a sake rack placed on top of a bowl to collect the whey. Within four hours I have the best and freshest 'cream cheese'."
4,Works decent,"This works pretty good. The holes on the lid are even small enough to sprout amaranth inside. The only problem is that the threads don't seem to line up properly on my Ball Wide Mouth quart jars. I can get it on securely, but it takes a couple of minutes of playing with it. Overall though they do what is expected pretty well."
4,Washburn Guitar,"This guitar is well constructed and excellent in appearance. The only fault I can find is that the low E string sounds dead with very little resonance when strummed. Except for that, the guitar has beautiful projection and brillance. It's a great guitar for the price."
1,Not much for a lot!,Shame on me for not reading the description carefully. $ 14.95 for only a 10 minute long DVD is criminal. And I fell for it.
1,Totally Out Of Date!,"To choose good mutual funds you need to do research. To do good research you need up-to-date information. There is no way that this OLD book can give you current, up-to-date information.Don't waste your money.You'd be much better off either going to FREE WEB SITES, such as Morningstar.com or Money.com (from Money Magazine) or Smartmoney.com (from Smart Money Magazine) that provide current and EXTREMELY well reseached information to anyone without having to waste your money on this book.If you do want a good investment book, consider Peter Lynch's One Up On Wall Street or Andrew Tobias's The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need."
1,Buy an Index Fund and Skip This Book,"This book is not needed. Use the money to buy shares in a well-managed index fund instead. If you still need advice, buy Peter Lynch's ""One Up On Wall Street."" Mr. Lynch's book has stood the test of time."
1,It's Not Brain Surgery,"You do need to do some research before you buy mutual funds but you don't need an overly long, extremely boring book to do it. You can quickly and easily narrow your choices by going to personal finance magazine web sites and the sites run by large mutual fund companies."
2,"Very Thorough, with Hot and Cold Info","Mr. Lewis wrote a very informative book, that has a tremendous amount of information on the plight of the lost Israelite tribes since the fall of Judea, or theories pertaining to such. However, Mr. Lewis never actually proves that the modern European Jews living in Israel are of Edomite ancestry, and shows a poor understanding of the Khazar kingdom in Southern Russia. The book is easy to read, and very informative, but can mislead those who are not knowledgeable about Jewish history."
4,Super Reader,"The goings on in Sir Percy Hits Back are a little bit different to the rest. Chauvelin features as a major character in a different way.His daughter, Fleurette, is involved in an incident that brings her under suspicion of the committee. He realises that with the zealousness shown so far, and the number of innocent people murdered that she is likely doomed, even if he can try and sway the court.There is not much hope that she can be saved, unless he turns to his bitter enemy, The Scarlet Pimpernel."
3,Alnico magnet,The magnet worked extremely well for my presentation. However it was LOTS smaller that I had imagined. Do you have others similar that are larger? Thanks.
2,Doesn't Stand The Test of Time,"OK, I'll admit it. I bought this cassette when it first came out, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Although I never went so far as to dress like Adam Ant, I definitely wore this the tape out from repeated play. I listened to it again just recently and realized that, like many things in life, my memories proved better than reality. The album just simply does not stand the test of time. With the exception of ""Stand and Deliver,"" and maybe ""Prince Charming,"" these songs are pretty weak. It's an interesting snapshot of a moment in history, but not one that will be long remembered."
2,"THIRD TIME ISN'T THE ""CHARM"" - a long way down from ""KINGS""","As much as I absolutely loved Adam and the Ants' first two albums - DIRK WEARS WHITE SOCKS and especially its crossover follow-up KINGS OF THE WILD FRONTIER - I just can't heartily recommend PRINCE CHARMING. Save for the three singles (the peerles, still heart-stopping STAND & DELIVER, possibly the ANTS best single, the campy title track, and the so-bad-its-good proto-rap ANT RAP), the rest sounds like flippant, indulgent dreck & doesn't stand up today. If you remember that KINGS came out in 1980, and this came out less than one year later in 1981, the album sounds like a rush job to capitalize on ADAM's run of radio hits - clever early MTV videos and swashbuckling image aside, PRINCE CHARMING proves that third time isn't the charm!"
3,Not the Best of the 80's,"This CD just seems to be lost. The music is not that great.It was the look of Adam Ant that sold. And that isn't much important to your ears.Sorry, I don't recommend this fake put on.I'm not big on pirates either."
4,Not as Comprehensive as Michael Marcombe's Guide but Worthwhile if You Can't Get That,"I work at David Fleay Wildlife Park on the Gold Coast and would have to say that although this book is good, I would actually recommend A Field Guide to Australian Birds by Michael Marcombe in preference to this. These books are very similar and both have colourful illustrations which make identifying a bird in your backyard or in a photograph you took on holidays simple and easy. Both also have information about the birds. Marcombe's guide just has a more comprehensive coverage so you are less likely to be disappointed that you cannot identify a particular bird if you get that great reference book instead. However if you can't get that one or you can't get it at a good price then you won't go wrong with Pizzey's Field Guide."
2,Wrong Size Sent (On Both!!!),Product looked to be good but I ordered one small in white and one small in black but received extra large in both.
2,Title misleading,"Interesting book on the treatment of sexual abuse victims. However, the title is extremely misleading. The book actually only has 32 pages that deal with ""the emotional survival of therapists"" in total. Therefore, I would not recommend this book, definately overpriced, unless you understand you are getting one therapist's experiences of treating sexual abuse victims. If that is the topic your looking for, then it's a decent read."
5,A blues legend,"I saw Rock Bottom perform many times around the Tampa Bay area with both his bands - The Silver King Band and The Cutaways. His music, humor, and personality were even larger than his physical stature. He was a fabulous entertainer. There aren't a lot of recordings of him, all are excellent if you love the blues."
2,Not Exactly as Advertised,"First, the photo for the product is misleading. The package clearly says ""Made in USA"" in the picture, but the actual product is ""Made in China"". Also, the clear plastic flap is very thin and weak. Even if you lightly pull on the flap to release the cover snap, the plastic flap starts to tear. You have to use your fingernail (or, ironically, a jewelrs screwdriver) to unfasten the snap. The screwdriver itself works well enough, but I haven't had to use it on a tough screw at this time."
4,a little more,"If you are just looking for a way to start yoga this is good, but I wish that it would include more information! On the otherhand it might be perfect until you wish to get more serious with further information..."
1,What a bad compilation!,Very bad choice of songs...I don't see how this CD can be called totally dance.
5,I live for this music!,"This is ""Totally Dance,"" a CD of the hottest dance singles in America. If all music could sound like this, the whole planet would be a better and safer place to live in. Face it, nobody listens to rock anymore. Live instruments are obsolete. Casio keyboards and computer programming are now all the rage and will continue to dominate the way we listen to music. Maybe we should organize a rally to destroy ALL guitars. That would put people like Jimmy Page, Steve Miller and David Gilmour right out of business, as they deserve to. The ways in which this CD is excellent are several. You can listen to it over and over and over and over and over and never get bored. Get this CD if you want to hear the future of music!"
1,ZERO Stars: Should be Negative (-2) Terrible Mixes and Songs,"I'm always looking for good dance music that escapes my collection. I have to say this CD is absolutely terrible. There are only one or two good songs to begin with, and even those are horribly mixed. Unbelieveable waste of money. This CD deserves NEGATIVE TWO (-2) for ruining the only two good songs on this disc. Trust me and buy Louis DeVito Underground Party volumes 1-6, and perhaps Ultimate Dance Party, Ultradance, etc...I have to cry that it is brand new and going right into the trash... ugh."
1,"Good Songs, But they are chopped off before done","Personally, I like these songs in the CD, but I am disgusted and giving this a poor review because most of the songs are chopped off abruptly at the end in the middle of songs or even in the middle of a word! No fade outs! That is disgusting, and unless you are going to transfer this to your own CD-R and fade it manually....don't waste your money."
5,Awesome!,This CD has everything that a dance party needs. It's all of today's biggest songs put into a dance mode that creates awesome vibes for parties and kickbacks.
1,(Almost) Totally Bad - 1 and 1/2 stars,"You do have some decent mixes by some decent artists like Moby, Dido and Faithless but the rest of this CD is ""abrasive club fare"" indeed. Just like the ""Now"" series, this CD contains a lot of stuff you heard too many times or did'nt want to hear at all.Buy a real house/dance CD instead."
1,Terrible,This is a terrible dance CD with bad remixes everywhere on it. They take songs that are already fast enough to dance to and speed them up even more till it sounds so bad. They also chop the songs off very abruptly and usually not even at the end. Don't waste your money.
1,Out of Date,I bought the CD for 2 specific songs. I only liked those 2 and 1 other on the whole CD. The music is out of date and has been heard so much I was tired of it before the songs finished playing.
4,a gift,this item was a gift for someone else they were very pleased it came right away also as stated thanks
3,"very general info, for the very new teacher","I purchased this book largely because of the unanimously positive reviews. I just finished my 3rd year teaching, but this was my first year at middle school. I found that this book was too general and basic for my needs. The few ideas that I had not already been exposed to were only described in a very brief and general way.In fairness, the cover of this book does say ""Eight critical building blocks for success every new middle school teacher should know the first year."" I should have paid more attention to the ""first year"" audience that this book is targeting. However, even in my first year of teaching I think I would have felt that this book was to general too be of use. Perhaps this would have been helpful during my student teaching."
5,5 stars...,"this book deserves 5 stars. after the first chapter i was hooked. The way Klass describes the events happening it just brings it to life as if it really happening. Personally, this is one of the best books ive ever read. period."
5,A Guide Book of United States Coins 2004,Great book showed me how much my to old coins were worth back when I bought it.
2,Bluebook is better for collectors,"The ""Bluebook"" is a better choice of coin collectors. The redbook is a RETAIL price guide, intended for dealers. I also noted the population data for state quarter proofs is significantly incorrect. The book's data only accounts for proof quarters sold in 5 piece sets. There were millions more made each year included in the 10 piece sets. Compare the numbers on pages 70 and 152."
2,"Good for what it includes, but where's the proof?","This book is good for what it includes, but there is a glaring and shocking omission! There is no info on proof sets, only on some individual coins. With the introduction of state quarter sets, annual proof sets have become a hot commodity, yet this book completely overlooks the entire category!"
2,Phone it in next time...,"How do you write a biography of a man and not talk to anyone who knew him, not visit anyplace he lived, and not include any photographs of the man or his family? It's easy: you write brief introductions to letters and passages from the writer's books, and call it a biography. The Red Hot Typewriter isn't red or hot. It is a color-by-numbers biography that is in the end colorless. A massive disappointment if you're a John D. fan, or a fan of good biography."
2,"Informative, but incomplete","As a diehard John D. MacDonald fan, I felt the book left much to be desired. MacDonald's pre-Travis McGee work, from l950-1960 most notably, was barely mentioned, or dismissed as unimportant. The author never took the time to interview the many people who worked with or knew MacDonald, relying only on correspondance. Overall, the book was a disappointment."
4,Life and Times and We miss you JDM!,"Good book, enjoyable read. I am a author myself and I enjoy books about the great ones of our times. I would have liked more insight into the inner world of John D, but this is a still a must for fans of his work."
4,John MacDonald Bio,This is a nice summary of the life and beliefs of the famous crime writer. It is a bit light on his early life and his WW II experience but gives nice details about his writing career and the other writers who influenced him.
2,Not worth purchasing,"There is absolutely no significant information in this book that you cannot find easily on the internet. The training section is very generic -- not specific to this breed at all. There are some cute pictures, but it's not worth buying the book for that reason. Save your money."
5,AMAZING,"This book is so well written and obviously a lot of time and research went into it. For Example the part about Pedro and the dry panning of gold in western Utah. When I was very young the dentist, Dr Stains DDS pulled out a tooth that was paining me immensely, He and my Father talked about this sheep herder.He is so detailed in his writing. I can hardly wait for Spring to come, take my GPS I got for Christmas and my new metal detector and go to several places he mentions. For me now, I am Google Earth searching these specific areas. This is a great book!!!! I highly recommend it."
3,Beware,"This is a great CD by the under-recorded Texas guitarist Hash Brown. I wish the tracks had been listed because it turns out to be the same as Hash Brown's Texas Blues Revue (Cannonball 29108). I was hoping for additional recordings by Brown, not a duplication of what I already have. The Cannonball CD is available from Amazon.com at a fraction of the price and the sound is significantly better. Order the Cannonball rather the European release on Double Trouble."
1,Piece of junk,"The tips of this set are made of very soft metal, so it was completely useless - I tried using this for removing a chain on my wife's watch, and smallest two (0.025"" and 0.040"") just got bent on their tips before unscrewing anything. I'd never buy anything from this brand."
3,Good set,Had all sizes I needed to break my watch even more. Finally sent in for repair. Worked well for fixing coworker watch.
3,P.M. yoga Melodies,"While some selections are really lovely and contribute to a progressive feel of relaxation, there are a couple of selections that are too blues inspired and jazzie in tone to blend into the overall CD. It makes it not as easy to practice to as I'd hoped it would be. If I could edit out the two selections that jump to dfferent attitudes and rhythms I could highly recommend this CD"
5,"PM is tops, but don't forget AM.","I have just purchased my third Yoga CD from this company and this a standout, though I love them all. A nice blend of pop, meditative and world instrumentation, almost sounds like a movie soundtrack. Songs number 3 and 6 are my favorites. My sister has this CD and loves to use for her massage classes and private practice. She said...""just buy it."""
3,Seismosaurus,"An excellent book, but the material is a little outdated, considering seismosaurus is no longer considered the longest dinosaur. All in all very well written and compiled, with beautiful paintings by Mark Hallett, dinosaur artist extrodinaire. Well done."
2,car charger adapter didn't work.,"the AC part works, I bought it last year so I forget if the cable and such worked (I quit using the Dell as it wouldn't keep a charge)...this was a last ditch effort to keep it working after the original cradle broke."
4,Nice product,"Sorry my english is not good, haha....the product works exactly as I want, the material is low quality, put works perfectly, i think is a very good buy, the price is excellent"
3,"For Infrequent, Gentle Use","Had one in my wood shop for measuring board thickness. Worked fine for a decade of infrequent use, then the plastic gear started skipping on the plastic rack. For a few more dollars, you can get a lifetime tool in metal."
1,Useless,"The first time I used it, the internal gear slipped. Now the measurements never line-up correctly, and it's useless unless I feel like subtracting the extra .41 that it reads instead of 0 every time (and I don't)."
2,Useless in metric,"It is accurate only to the mm scale in metric readings. So to get better than 0.5mm accuracy you will need to measure in Inches to 0.01"" accuracy and then convert units.The price is also high for a very plastic construction that cannot survive dropping onto a hard surface.Save money and learn to use a vernier caliper for a cheaper and better product with higher accuracy."
4,works,I have had no troubles with mine not being accurate or loosing it's 0. works perfectly for my every use and it doesn't need batteries.
2,Useless for metric measurements,"I bought this caliper for measuring bicycle seat posts, stems, etc. Not very exacting work. Well, forget it. It's only accurate to 1mm. The dial only measures in .01"" or 1/64th"", not mm. When the dial shows exactly 1 inch, the scale shows 25 mm, not 25.4mm. Measuring a marked 22.2mm stem, it shows 21.5mm. The only way to make this device work is to measure in inches and convert to mm.If you never measure anything metric, you might be ok, but even if you argue that the mm scale is provided as a convenience this level of accuracy falls short of any reasonable expectation."
2,Not Worth It,"...not worth the asking price. Drop it and the internal gear gets knocked out of its rack requiring you to pry open the dial and fiddle it back into position. Also, the neadle on the dial broke off for no apparent reason. I'm getting a metal caliper like I should have in the first place."
1,Not at all precise,"My father had picked up a couple of these calipers thinking they were a good deal. I checked one using a 1"" micrometer standard. I found the calipers were both off. One was off by .021 (21 thousandths) and the other was off by .007 (7 thousandths) when measuring an exact inch. I did not have a two inch standard available, but it stands to reason that at 2 inches they could be off by as much as 42 and 14 thousandths respectively. These inexpensive calipers might be suitable for rough work but I would not count on them for fine machining, ammunition reloading, or any job where precise and accurate measurements are critical."
5,Good kit!,"No complaints here. The screen protector are almost exactly like boxwave protectors and have crystal like transparency. I would rebuy the whole set again just for the screen protectors if they become unavailable.The case is very nice, well constructed.The skin is a drab gray but well built and will protect the micro. I echo the reviewer who said it attracts dust. Keep it away from dust and lint.3 Lanyards good for those who have kids.Won't even try earbuds. They looks and feel terrible.2 game case is nice, well constructed.Auto AC included, never tried.3 lint free wipes are effective."
4,It's good,"A few of the items seem a bit cheap, but they fulfill their purposes, so I have no other complaints."
2,Not sure if it's worth the money,"First, I ordered the 21-in-1 kit, and was sent the 12-in-1. After seeing this in person, I don't think it would have made much difference even if I had gotten the right one.The cases for the GBM and games (2 games only) are passable. The silicone skin is nice. The rest of the stuff....well...cheap earbuds, a couple of screen protectors and 3 cleaning cloths. Keep in mind that the the 2 screen protectors count as 2 items and the 3 cloths count as 3 items in the ""12"" total. The 21-in-1 seems to pad the item total with several plastic cases for individual games.I would have bought the GBM case and skin by themselves if they had offered it, but I wouldn't have paid this much for it. All-in-all I'm dissappointed."
3,Detonation: Theory and Experiment - not quite a dud,"This book is a good history lesson on the advancement of the study of explosions.It represents the ad-hoc nature of the development of the theory and experimental analysis.While reading the book, I got the feeling this was a way for the authors to publish much of their own and some of their favored colleagues unpublished work.Some of the derivations are quite light and most equations are presented as a matter of fact, but I guess that was by design."
3,One song can make a whole CD worth getting!,"Obscure, late 80's, Dark-Alt band, Blue Blue Blue 'Reclusallucination' CD (quite peculiar title, eh?). Put out in 1989 by C'est La Mort records, The label which gave us all of those 'Doctor Death's' compilations. The CD is overall merely okay, except for one totally great, full-on Goth song ""New Joke"". However this same song appeared two years previously in 1987 on the excellent 'Sorority Sampler' vinyl LP. If you can find that elsewhere, get it instead of the whole Blue Blue Blue CD. Then you'll get ""New Joke"", plus FLOWER-concrete/BRAINEATERS-ballad of arcane/CRASH BUREAU- its so cold/OF A MESH-thorn/FAHRENHEIT 451- zombies/FIELD MUTTS-cream of the Milkman/KILPIG-til death do us part/ LONE COWBOYS-i live in a ditch/SEA MONSTERS-sex god chant. Of course you'd have to own a turntable and find the record in the first place..."
5,A Secret Shared&#65533;,"It turns out that Visser One is trying to gain control of the National Guard, and that means making controllers out of them. So the Animorphs have decided that, in order to stand a chance against them, they have to tell the world about the Yeerks. So they send Marco, Tobias, and Ax to try and convince the governor of the truth. But, as usual, what was supposed to be a low profile mission ends up as your not-so-average highway chase scene. Animorphs just keeps getting better as we draw closer and closer to the end. Ax even learned how to do jokes and sarcasm. But the funniest part, IMHO, was when Tobias criticized his duck morph. Lisa Harkrader ghostwrote this one and she did a great job."
3,Lotsa fun,"Lots of fun, this book. It was about time that the war made a little more of a mark upon the world. It gave the Animorphs that much more responsibility."
5,Need to learn the SAT vocabulary?,"This book of 30 chapters teaches 10 SAT vocabulary words at a time, giving multiple approaches and practice to master them. I use it with my 10th grade gifted English classes and love it."
2,Unsatisfactory,"Seller said it was new, but majority of the pages were written in. They used pencil so that's a poSitive side to it."
1,Very Disapponted,This book has little or nothing to do with the promises indicated by its title. Its author does not reach a male reader. Maybe this book was aimed toward 10 year old girls who want to imagine kissing in perfect-romance someday.
2,much promise no delivery,"Was disappointed, barely enough substance to be considered fluff. Nothing mentioned about when a kiss is appropriate,mainly a guide to enforce the learn by doing idea.Not a good gift for preteens, excellent for people you don't want to learn anything."
2,comp doesnt fully charge,my old charger that broke charged my comp up to 99% i have had this plugged in for 3 days and its up to 39% now.... it took HOURS just to get to 20% and stayed there for a full day. not cooolll
2,works when it wants to,"i thought i was getting a deal by not going to the mac store and purchasing this adapter for $85. however, i should have just went ahead and paid the extra $30 cause this one is a piece of crap. i don't even think it is really made by mac at all after comparing it to my old one. the markings on each vary in many ways including the apple logo and some of the print on the bottom. it really only works when it wants to after unplugging a few times and playing around with the part that plugs into the computer. and it didn't come with the white prongs that make it a square. only a long black cord. i tried to put the prongs from my old adapter on the new one, but they don't even fit properly. i figure if it they are both made by apple, it should have been a perfect fit, right? wrong. so sketchy. do yourself a favor, spend the extra $$$, go to the mac store."
1,Junk Scammer - Don't Buy This Product,"I purchased this adapter from this seller. Firstly, it was the wrong power setting, only 45W instead of the 65W which is sold in America. Secondly, the adapter which plugs into the computer was smaller than the orignial Apple adapter and cracked in only 4 months of usage. This product is being pawned off as a new power adapter, but is really just a refurbished adapter which is junk. I wasted 55 bucks on it, don't waste your money. Buy the adapter from Apple. Your extra 25 bucks will buy a product which may last years, instead of months."
3,"works, but it cracked","you can't buy this from apple anymore since they changed the adapter for the new computers, so the fact that there are still sold was really great, but the plastic cracked about a week after I bought it. It still works but I wish it didn't crack"
1,Beware,"This product says it works with Powerbook G4s. Not true, this is a 45W adapter Powerbook G4s need a 65W adapter."
1,Misleading and inaccurate product listing!!,"I purchased this AC adapter as a replacement unit for my Apple iBook. I have news for you, this is not the right adapter. The original one is 65W, this one is 45W and inadequate for powering the iBook G4 14 inch. Mine died after just 5 months of use because of this fact, confirmed at the Apple Store's Genius Bar technician. Since this unit is only 45W it was struggling to power my computer until it finally fried. DO NOT BUY THIS AS AN ORIGINAL APPLE REPLACEMENT for an iBook laptop, IT IS NOT and you will have wasted your money."
1,MISLEADING ITEM DISCRIPTION,"WHEN I READ THE ITEM DESCRIPTION AND VIEWED THE PHOTO OF THE ITEM IT MISLED ME TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS PURCHASING THE APPLE MODEL ""BRICK"" AC PLUG. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE.THE ADAPTER THAT WAS SENT WORKS WITH MY COMPUTER HOWEVER IS A KNOCK OFF BRAND. BUYER BEWARE! IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A REPLACEMENT PLUG MADE BY APPLE DO NOT BUY THIS,!"
1,Bait & switch,The product that arrived was something completely different & it did not work w/ my old G4. The plug barely fit the connection. Had to return it. Found a perfect replacement on eBay at half the cost.
2,It's Alright,"it wasn't the product I ordered but, it works and charges my laptop. Wasn't too impressed just because it was the exact opposite of what I wanted."
1,"AC Adapter A1036, M8482 For Apple Ibook, Titanium, Powerbook G4, G3 [Misc.]","RUBISH!! Power adapter that was sent to me was totally different than original picture used to advertise it by Amazon. Instead of the nice, slim, well designed Apple adapter, I was sent a brick. I could live with that, but the quality was so pathetic that I could not keep it. When I called Amazon's customer service they dealt with it very professionally and painless and consequently I sent it back and got a credit from Amazon. I still am just mad that I was mislead by the correct photo of the product, but receiving a different product."
1,Not what I expected - not as the picture displayed,"I chose this product over others as it was supposed to be the Apple Replacement AC Adapter - New. The one that arrived was clearly used, after market model - with the power cord (one from outlet to transformer) a completely different color. Further, this model does not charge the battery - it only powers the laptop. If the battery is dead and you unplug - even after hours of being plugged in - the laptop will lose all power. I am returning this to Amazon."
1,Total Rip Off,"This was a total rip off. Not only are the pictures not of the actual product that I got, but I got an adapter with only 2 feet of cord instead of the original 6 foot cord, and on top of that my extension cord that attaches into the removable plug part wont fit so I can't use my laptop plugged in unless I'm sitting right next to an outlet. The thing that angers me the most about this is that I bought this based on the photos, because what they showed was exactly the same as my power adapter I thought it'd be fine. Don't bother buying."
1,Lousy Quality,It took about 20 minutes for the product to dissolve (melting down by power).Awful!!! I should stick to buying directly from Apple.ATG
1,Piece of crap,This charger is not good at all! DO NOT BUY!! We haven't even had it a full year and it already doesn't work! Worthless~
1,Just Plain Does Not Fit...,Listed as a replacement for the Powerbook G3. It simply is not the right adapter. You would think they would at least check before they put it in the title.
1,"Terrible... Wrong answers, bad review!","Terrible for three reasons:1. Answers to sample tests are often wrong2. Review is confusing and incomplete3. The Physics B sample test covers material not on the exam (angular acceleration, etc.)"
1,Too many errors,I just looked at a few questions (5th edition) in one chapter. There were numerous errors (check questions 29 and 30 on page 238). That was a small random sample but would dissuade me from recommending this review book.
5,great book!,"Full explanations to basic concepts in philosophy, both sides of topics are covered. Pojman is great."
3,Moultrie,"Not the best of feeders I've had in the past.The dependency of it being operated with the photo cell, causes feeding times to not be presice day to day.Cloudy days, it will come on later than I like, same thing in the evenings.The quietness is what I was going for and it is quiet.Having had this up and going for awhile. I've rechecked it the other day and along with pics from my trail cams, have found a bear has already destroyed one of these feeders.OK product, but because of ther timing issue, I wouldn't buy another one."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought one of these last year and in less than two weeks one of the wires on the photo sensor broke off. (a very small sensitive piece not built for outdoor use) This feeder is in a remote location and it was not worth the time and effort to send back under warranty. I installed an analog timer to keep the unit running as my barrel had 300 lbs of corn in it. This worked great for about 3 months and then one of the wires on the motor broke. IMHO, I do not think this product from Moutrie lives up to their usual standards. I have not used the feeder for months but plan to replace with a new feeder unit and it will not be a Moultrie. The only reason I gave it one star is because it is quiet. Sorry bout that Moultrie...jus call'in it as I see it."
4,England Swings!,"It was the time of Mary Quant, mini-skirts and trouser suits. It was also the time of Charlie Manson and his family. In this well read audiobook, the author tells the story of a college girl, who was the only person who could identify a killer on a train, a young female plainsclothes detective and a killer who creates works of art from blood and bone.Not just another serial killer mystery, this book also deals with the changes in society that were occuring in the later 60's early 70's as a modern police force comes face to face with an age old evil.Definitely recommended if you enjoy Alison G. Taylor's novels or the BBC's Wire in the Blood."
2,Cheaply made and poor service,"I purchased this from Max Tool and am very disappointed. The product arrived in a normal delivery box, but when I opened the case, the parts were everywhere, and the case was damaged on the inside. I have no idea where all these parts are suppose to sit inside the case, and it was damaged so bad I called Max Tool. The lady told me someone would contact me within 7 days to give me a return number. Two weeks later still no call, so I called back. Then the guy that answered said it had been too long to replace the item and that I would have to PAY for a new case. I've already paid for one, why would I risk having to pay for another that might be the same way. As for the tools, they look cheaply made and have hydraulic oil all over them. If you buy, dont get it from Max Tool. Maybe yours will be in better shape."
3,still good,"this record has some excellent stuff but is not as good top to bottom as their previous 2. still ""quineela"" and ""alien"" are ars classics..."
5,My Favorite Album In The World !,I like it because it's South Rock. They are a great band. I love this band. And this is my favorite album in the world !!!Homesick is 5/5 stars. Quinella is 5/5 stars. Alien is 4/5 stars. Higher is 3/5 stars. You're so strong 5/5 stars. Outlaw music is 3/5 stars. Pretty girl is 4/5 stars. Southern exposure 4/5 stars. Going to Shangri-La 5/5 stars.
1,Riches from God aren't always monetary,"Now I understand why I've seen so many checks with ""money cometh"" on them. It disturbs me that people look to God for monetary wealth. Look to God for spirtual wealth. For financial wealth, look to Clark Howard."
5,Used on iPads,"In conjunction with headphone to headphone cable, I use these as adapters when needed in classrooms. They work great! Inexpensive and a great price."
1,Avoid this company,They send the wrong part and then when confronted send the correct part but charge you for both even though it will cost more to send back than it cost.Avoid this company
3,"Collection of partly useful, partly trivial advice","This book is a collection of advice on different subjects the author finds important for scientists. Some of the advice is helpful. But still the book suffers from several problems: * Its language is often stilted and old-fashioned * Most subjects are only shortly touched (e.g., writing, the scientific process) and a large part of the advice consists of trivialities everybody involved in science certainly knows already. So if you are really interested in in-depth advice on doing science well, you should probably read other, more specialized books (e.g., Krantz: A Primer of Mathematical Writing). Thus the title of the book is rather misleading: The book is not for scientists (not even for young scientists), but it might be the book of choice for people who have to decide whether to go into science, or for people who just want to have a taste of what scientific life is about."
2,A very blend book,"The advices in this book are very blend. This book is far inferior when compared to books like ""Advice for a young investigator"" or ""A PhD is not enough."""
2,Good details but...,"I bought this dvd but when I started using it unfortunately I found out the following defects:1) The arplanes don't stay still even with the parking brake pulled and the engines on idle (minimum power). They keep ""inching"" forward.2) Transponder cannot be set. The tower keeps telling me that there is something wrong with my transponder. At that point I went to set the frequency by hand using its console but it does not accept the value that I want to set. It automaticaly goes back to zero untill the tower cut me off and cancels my IFR flight following.3) There is a nice effect with sparks when, rotating during take off, the tail of the plane touchs the gruond. On my Flight Simulator the sparks start as soon as I turn on the engines and they won't ever go away.Graphic and details are great but I cannot play with them because of those troubles. I would like to use these plane more and find out all it can offer but unfortunately my experience with this product stops at two stars..."
1,Digital Caliper failures,"I work for an industrial supplier and bought this caliper last year for measuring bore sizes and Outside diameters etc of sprockets, pulleys, and bearings. The good feature is that it converts metric to inch with the touch of a button.Bad: if you turn it off while calipers are opened and then turn it on it starts at 0 and I cannot figure out why this is a good feature.Bad: after less than a year the readout went whacko and turning it on caused the numbers to change arbitrarily about a thousand times a minute! This is too expensive if it is a throwaway, but i learned i cannot be without one. Next time I'll try a more expensive one like Starrett"
2,plastic caliper,"This caliper just doesn't feel right. I'm much more comfortable with the standard metal caliper... this thing is too light. also no thumbwheel or jaw lock feature.It is accurate, though, and doesnt seem to have a lot of backlash error. This thing would be better in the hobby room than in the shop. For shop use, I'd get a nice metal one with a covered rack and plan on paying closer to $100. Suggest you do the same unless you are a hobbyist or model builder.mm to inches conversion is nice, though."
1,You get what you pay for,"The specs on this caliper looks good, but the quality is garbage.These calipers came without a certificate of calibration, which indicates it's worth/usefulness. I opened the jaws and they had plastic burrs on them. This does not meet any standards for an accurate caliper. I have not even put batteries in them, I'm returning them and getting Mitutoyo, like I should have done to begin with."
1,"If you want a caliper, You shouldn't be looking for one on .","If I wanted to buy a new pair of shoes, I'd go to a shoe store to get some not a book store. Same thing goes for a calipur. If your looking for a an accurat high quality caliper, go get a industrial supply manual. Contrary to what the ubove person thinks, good metal calipurs do not come in a pretty display case to be shown in a museum. They come with a pretty case to protect them, and because a good metal calipur usualy cost $150+ dollars. My advise to everyone is that you get what you pay for and if you want a crapy plastic cheap calipur then get this one, otherwise go look for one in industrial supply catalogs. P.S. a good brand for calipers is mitoyo."
4,The Shopping Bags,"I was visiting someone out of state and they had this book, I started to read it and found it very interesting and purchased this book from Amazon.Com when I returned home. I have found a lot of helpful information in this book, that I also purchased one as a gift for someone."
5,If you're a consumer who often winds up feeling ripped off in the shopping world...,"If you're a consumer who often winds up feeling ripped off in the shopping world, you must turn to THE SHOPPING BAGS: TIPS, TRICKS AND INSIDE INFORMATION TO MAKE YOU A SAVVY SHOPPER for insights. It offers advice on shopping for food, home, or entertainment alike, from power tools to dryers, and adds flair and fun to the process. Explanations of what to look for, desirable and undesirable features, and common problems in product lines make for invaluable references.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,I can't believe I paid money for this book!,"Okay, if these girls can get published, anyone can. It reads like they are are really self absorbed celebrity wanna-bees who talk about feminine products and deodorant like they are the second coming of Johnson and Johnson. They have basic information that you can learn flipping through a fashion magazine or from browsing the internet - it was so insulting, like I have never been on the web. Save your money!"
4,Nice Travel Bag for Passports and Misc.Items,Nice bag which big enough and useful compartments for easy usage. A bit expensive but not bad IMHO.
4,"Very durable ""fun"" bag to carry...","Overall I am very happy with this product. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 is because sometimes it seems like the number of zippers can be too cumbersome. It is great in that you won't lose anything from your purse, but to reach in for your cell phone, or keys, you have to unsnap and unzip, or at least unzip. The Kipling products are awesome, and there are plenty of styles to choose from. I just happend to choose a style that was a little ""too"" secure for my needs at times."
2,"Too ""English"" for my taste","I've lived in England and have read many books written by an English author, in an English setting with English slang phraseology. But as much as I tried to like it, it was just lacking in a hook to keep me interested and then the over-Englishness. I wiped it from my device after being about 1/3 of the way through."
1,DONNA AND THE FAT MAN,WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOOK.....ONLY READ A SMALL PORTION AND THEN JUST WENT TO ANOTHER BOOK...DID NOT LIKE IT
4,Great video quality,It's a nice-looking product. Part of the installation looked like a system freeze but it finished. I got it to record TV shows on DVDs using the Ulead and the video quality is great. I also use Adobe Premiere so I capture in Ulead and edit the AVIs in Adobe. Overall this product is working for me.
2,"uncomfortable, flimsy but very roomy","The only plus of the Kipling backpack is just how much stuff it can hold. I have taken a full shopping bag of goods and fit it inside the expandable backpack to the amazement of friends. Only problem is the zippers aren't of the best quality and jam frequently and aren't made to bear the stress of the amount of goods that can fit in this backpack. The overall design is mediocre at best and the straps are pretty uncomfortable when you're carrying anything of substance. Backpacks like the Kensington Contour have super comfortable form fitting straps but hold next to nothing aside from your laptop. If you need sheer volume, buy the Kipling but don't be surprised if you need to have the zipper fixed in a year. It is the biggest small backpack I have found and that's what I need most. I just wish it wasn't so damn uncomfortable."
1,Absolutely worthless,"I'm a huge fan of Richard Carlson's original ""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff"" book that was originally published in 1997, so I was excited to see that he also wrote a book about finances. After about five minutes of reading it, however, I found it to be the most utterly worthless financial advice book imaginable. It ought to be called, ""Ridiculously Simple and Obvious Advice for Utter Morons Who Don't Know the First Thing About Money."" Anyone who can tell the difference between a penny and a quarter surely knows everything in this book already. I can't believe that Carlson actually put his name on this one. Trust me, the best way to start managing your finances wisely is to avoid spending any money on this book."
4,Simple But Effective,"I kinda liked this book. It wasn't written for the people who know a lot about finances. There are plenty of books around that are for them. What this book IS is 100 suggestions about how to start thinking about money in non-stressful ways. Just like all the other titles in this series.I didn't need to read the book but I picked it up because no matter where a person is in their financial life there is a lot of information they can use. Information that they might not have remembered about because they need to start over but have no idea how to begin. Any one of these tips would be useful for either a beginner who is starting to accumulate ""real"" money or a person just trying to get out of debt. People don't think straight when they worry about things as important as money and that's what this book helps them deal with."
1,Remixed by Ministry,"The engineers of Ministry were so impressed with the debut release ""01"" that they asked to remix the best tracks, the result being a great aggro metal industrial sound beyond Ministry!"
3,Very nice game,"I bought it for my 7 & 9 year olds,they loved it.One thing they cannot get pass level 7 they tried I even tried but we are stuck."
3,Good for intended purpose but . . .,"This works great for cleaning and inspecting, for sighting (limited per below), but know that you cannot fire the weapon from this stand.If you want to sight in your rifle from a bench rest you can fire from, this is not the one you want."
3,Good for cleaning and maintenance,"This unit is good for cleaning and maintenance, but is pretty much useless for shooting. I tried taking it the range to sight in a new rifle, and found the sand bags better to use than this rest. I think if I was to do it all over again, I would choose something that would be better to take to the range."
2,Too Light,The brace fails too hold the rifle steady between shots. I was using it to zero in a .22 MAG and it kicked too hard for the mount.
5,More info about this book,This is the next installment in the regressing yearly strip reprint series. These are from 1996. The dailies are un-colorized (unlike the previous book) and the Sundays are in color.
5,This book will shorten your learning curve!,"This is a serious book for real traders. Not a skim-the-surface introduction. Get ready for some detailed discussions on issues that most experienced traders learn the hard way. This book will shorten your learning curve, well worth the low price!Sure, some chapters don't interest me, but it's a thick book, it contains something for everyone. Filled with practical advice in very understandable language. If you're looking for a ""10 steps to easy riches"" book, keep looking, this is reality here.If you want to develop a real edge in the markets, this book is filled with what you need."
1,Save your money.,"This book should be an embarrassment to Prentice Hall. The Preface, The Intro and the first chapter are condescending and worthless. One contributor mentions how important displace moving averages are, and even though he admits he didn't know what they were, he doesn't explain them to the reader. One early chapter is wasted on telling the trader to take a break from trading evry now and then. How profound! Chapter 9, on evaluating trding systems is full of BLANK CHARTS. The text repeatedly refers to charts that have no data in them. One wonders if anyone ever proofed this book. I admit I haven't finished the book. There may be worthwhile chapters to come, but I may not survive to the end."
2,A multiple-author hodgepodge of trading strategies,"There is little cohesion or direction in this collection of chapters, each by a different author. It reminded me more of a collection of conference proceedings than than the comprehensive treatise the title seems to promise. For example, I suppose neural network theory is germane to computerized trading by large institutions but I suspect that even active mathematically-savvy investors (me, for example) will find little of practical use for day-trading. There are better books with recent publication dates...Friedfertig's book on day-trading comes to mind...and I almost returned Jurik's ""book"". In retrospect, I wish I had."
4,"Good stuff , lots of heart","Lots of heart and good stuff ... which I appreciate as a parent and someone into yoga myself. I love the fact that these songs are simple enough for young children to sing. As an adult, I find the simpleness and singability of the songs are more like melodic chants or mantras in English. Actually listening to them, using them for yoga poses, and singing them really brings them to life.I am glad to have found out about this CD and have recommended this to other yoga-families who are looking for inspirations."
3,Good songs but . . .,"I enjoy the songs on this CD. They make for a fun and comprehensive yoga practice for kids. He put a lot of thought into the words and ideas in the music. However, I am a bit turned off by his voice. It's a little nasal for my taste. I wish there were a variety of singers and tones on this CD. Other than that, a good kids' yoga CD."
3,thelifeofanmountainmidwife,an absolutely amazing story. To be able to go back in time and learn what it was like then can only give you food for thought and prayers of thanksgiving
1,history on a midwife,"wanted to hear more about the history of midwifery in the mountains of that region, somewhat of a time line instead."
4,Helped for Problem Knees,"With suddenly two torn miniscus and a fracture, I felt like I was lost in a foreign movie without sub titles. The MD and the physical therapist both were poor in explaining in laymen's terms what treament was needed and what the prognosis was. This book gave me a better understanding of my condition and alloweed me to gather sufficent information to talk with the MD and the therapist. One additional benefit was that it provided better drawings of the exercises than the therapist provided. In addition it showed additional exercises so that I could change my routine slightly and keep from getting bored with the routine.If you have a significant knee injury you can not afford to be without this book."
4,The Knee Crisis Hanbook,"I think this is a great starter book about the knee and injuries! The author has written the book so anybody can understand their knee problem! In fact, I was able to help friend at work understand her sprained LCL!"
2,not impressed,I'm looking for a book that will pinpoint my self recovery methods. This book failed to do that.don't waste your money.
5,Excellent resource for any sales professional,"The value of this book is that it shows how traditional ""numbers games"" in sales are simply that, games. In focusing solely on activity, managers often loose sight of real issues facing a sales force. This book puts it in perspective and backs it up with reliable data."
4,True School Rebirth,Fans of '93 - '96 Hip Hop (not Rap) will find themselves reminiscing of artist from this era. Lushes dense rhymes and full beats are sure to impress. Not for the masses but definitely worth a listen. A little old with a little new makes for a great mix.T.Ro
3,Where I come From,The track listing on amazon says that Where I Come From is #2 on the cd but the listing on the back of the cd does not. I bought this cd as a present for someone specifically for that song amd I am very disappointed that it is not there. Is it a hidden track? Or did someone list the songs wrong?
2,"Disappointing release, had hoped for better","Drew's album was a disappointment to me. Like so many releases these days, I enjoyed a couple of songs and found the rest just rehashes and somehow boring. I've enjoyed the Sister Hazel stuff for years, but this one was a real letdown. Sorry."
4,Nice Soft Rock Album,"Overall, it's a pretty good album. I've been a longtime fan of Sister Hazel and I loved Ken Block's solo album, so I thought I'd give the other half of SH a try. For the most part, the songs are good. A real 90s alternative/soft rock sound to it, and mostly the songs are good. There's one or two I didn't care for at all, but other than that, most of the other tracks are 4 or 5 out of 5 stars. Worth listening to; may recognize the opening track. A lot of people were complaining in the reviews that they couldn't find the song ""Where I come From,"" but that's the song ""A little Like heaven."" People know it by different titles, but rest assured, it's on this album.Good tunes"
4,Surprising,This was a freebie on Amazon...one of the best surprises I've had lately when it comes to freebies. He's a good singer and the album is a good one.
2,"Intiricate design, hand painted, but FRAGILE","Loved this product, well, for a week. The cork broke off into the bottle and I was stuck with a Shiba Inu dog with a chain attached. Upset about it, but not a huge loss at $12"
2,I probably could of printed this out myself...,"In a way, this poster is smaller than 11""x17"". The poster has at least an inch of just white on both sides. So it's more like 11""x15"" which is crap in my opinion. I was going to give it one star, but it's still Howl's Moving Castle so I gave it that extra star."
5,A recommended pick for both public and college-level libraries.,"One in ten Americans suffer from depression, so today it's widely acknowledged and discussed: this updated coverage of an acclaimed survey includes over ten years of new research, from advances in medical treatments to changes in public perception and understanding of depression, and is key to any in-depth health collection seeking to provide the latest details. From its survey of the latest antidepressants to new approaches in psychology, Depression: The Mood Disease is a recommended pick for both public and college-level libraries.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,Soundtrack Masterpiece by Jerry Goldsmith,"The full soundtrack of Rambo 3, composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith. Some may think of some songs looking alike, but to the acurate listener and fan, it is, without error, a great deal. Excellent music!Inside the CD enchart, there is an small text about the recording, musical features and techniques for songs or all the CD, that might prove useful for those that have musical education and apreciate it.Most of the score in this CD was not used in the film. Actually, several sequences had tracked music from First Blood Part II, but nevertheless, it is still worth it!"
1,Worst Radicals: Worst Book,Terrible book. Poorly written and was the most painful thing for me to sit and read through. The book itself was in good condition.
5,Beautiful book,"A great book that explores the complexities of human relationships, tough choices all intertwined in the easy flow of daily life. Lovely!"
5,Serene and beautiful,"I don't think too much should be said about this author's books, especially this one, because telling too much always runs the risk of ruining other people's experience of reading his books. Silence in October takes you on an emotional journey through a man's marriage. Through the protagonist, the author skillfully depicts the very human limitation of love: that no matter how deeply and strongly one loves another, he can never fully and completely come to understand and know his beloved and his love. The book will sweep you like a breeze; reading it was like watching Godard's Contempt."
3,Plot driven humour,"This was my second book by Jens Christian Grondahl. I most enjoyed the part where the married man falls for the temptation of a young woman in New York, and becomes unfaithful in his otherwise happy marriage. That part showed to me that Grondahl can be fun. Basically I have detected two kinds of humour in litterature. First there is the obvious humour, the slapstick kind of humour, which is upfront and everybody can grasp it and laugh. Then there is another kind of humour, which is more subtle. The humour here is withdrawn and deep and placed in the plot. So that the humour appears in how the different events are chained together. This kind of humour not everybody detects, it's of a more sophisiticated kind than the slapstick humour. As a reader it gives me an inner smile when I read this kind of humour. Karen Blixen often uses this deep, plot driven, humour in her stories in ""Winter's Tales""."
5,"Killer stuff, this.","Hey Sugar, the debut cd from Bossanova, prooves that the folks over at TeenBeat have an ear for the good stuff. The band, comprised of members of the New Pornographers and Black Mountain, pours forth cheerful pop tunes with surprisingly violent (at times) lyrics. ""Calvary"" for example kicks off with ""It's time to kill/ They're waiting on top of the hill"". It never strains though, and just try to listen to this and not nod your head. Hopefully a taste of what's to come."
5,More essential paleo-conservative reading,"Along with the American Conservative, Chronicles is one the highlights of my month. While AC is more ""newsy"", Chronicles, as its byline states, deals more with heavier, cultural issues. Many of the writers seem to be refugees from the leftist takeover at National Review. The viewpoint is pro-Catholic, pro-Southern (US) and pro-Western. There is a narrower idealogical focus to Chronicles than in AC, with more of a religous slant than I personally care for. Still, there is so much solid reporting and commentary here that I will be subscribing for a long time to come."
2,Am cancelling,There are a few good articles but it should be listed as a South-still-fighting-the-Civil-War magazine. Where else do you hear Lincoln reviled?
3,"Good pace and well written, but I didn't care for the storyline","This book is very different from her next two in the series. It is much gorier and almost reminded me of Ann Rice more then a JR Ward or Sherrilyn Kenyon. It is more of the standard fare with the vampire feeling an instant connection to the women, but there is nothing that really makes her standout from other women where you can see why she is special from everyone else he has met.If you read the next two in the series, which are the best vampire books I have read and stand alone by themselves, you will most likely want to read this one. If you only get books every once in a while, pass on this one and go right to book 2 and 3. Each one in the series keeps getting better then the previous one and each one is unique."
1,"SAME OLD, SAME OLD","A ""whole new spin on the vampire legends""? Oh, come now! Makes me wonder just how many other vampire books the previous reviewer has read. We're talking yawnsville here: vampire (the hero of the story) who has been around for eons has grown weary of his immortal life, chances upon fair maiden and is irresistably drawn to her, finding the love of his life...his very, very, very, very, very long life, that is; and she, in turn, knows that he is destined to be the one true love of her life, too...even though she hasn't lived nearly as long as him. I am so SICK of that premise! Dress it up all you want with vampires and mystery plots, but it's still just your basic grocery store checkout lane romance novel."
3,OK,"I so love Michelle's work. I tried to read this like 3 times. I couldnt. Sorry Michelle, this was just ok!"
5,Literally couldn't put it down,"When I received Brian's latest book I decided to take a couple of minutes to look it over.I really liked his first book Dice Angel (Warning! if you don't have time to finish it, think twice about starting it,)Of course, 4 hrs. later I was still reading. I just blew off work and finished it. I don't know about you, but I don't often find a book that gripping. It hooked me early and took me for a great ride. Congratulations Brian on another great read and thanks."
5,Las Vegas Expert,"No other fiction writer knows Las Vegas like Rouff... and I mean the ""real Las Vegas,"" not the network TV Las Vegas. Like Rouff's ""Dice Angel,"" ""Money Shot"" had me laughing out loud. If you like Las Vegas, sports or humor, READ THIS BOOK. Luckily for me, I like all three. I'm ready for Rouff's next novel. Is there one on the way?"
5,Win-win book for me!,"I'm a Las Vegas native and work in advertising. I can't help it - I'm in love with this book. (Even if, initially, the title threw me off!)Brian Rouff does a great job portraying the life of the everday guy, Alan, and his life altering experience in a way that is realistic although it is anything but typical reality.Very fun."
5,"I didn't think I would, but I loved it!","I'm not much of a sports person and so, even though I really enjoyed Dice Angel, I didn't know if I would like this one as much. I couldn't put it down! Rouff's books are as much character studies as they are exciting stories. Just as in Dice Angel, I REALLY cared what happened to these people. I wanted to laugh when they laughed and cry when they cried, and when justice is served in the end, I sent up a cheer. Great book!"
4,Fun summer read,"I loved ""Money Shot."" Brian Rouff gives everyman a chance for greatness, both in the glare of the television camera and the quieter places of the heart. With his signature style of lively prose and engaging character, Rouff writes a wonderfully entertaining read."
5,Money Shot is on target!,"I read this book in one sitting. The voice of the narrator, burnt-out advertising exec Alan Nichols, is sometimes hilariously and sometimes wincingly funny. He captures the dialogue of his characters with a precise ring of truth and generous helpings of scintillating wit. Irreverent of corporate America, but living in the reality of wanting a big bite of the pie, Alan Nichols becomes the hero in everyone's shadow self, taking one big shot and putting everything on the line to get there. A fast, entertaining, funny-as-hell book I can't recommend highly enough. Read it before it's a movie, it's THAT GOOD!"
3,Mixed,The renditions of the old stuff were great. Didn't care as much for the newer songs nor the Christmas selections.
1,not the right one,"Unfortunatly was not the right version that I thinking!I believe that was a double vinyl as complete concert in cd version,so I loose my money because this item have not a complete explanation.Very bad purchase!"
3,Fewer vocals would have been better.,"This album is a mix of outstanding playing and so-so vocals. I am an avid Tull fan and have most of Ian's solo works as well. This one is kind of interesting. The instrumentation and arrangements are worthy of 5 stars. However, Ian's vocals (and his intros to a lot of the songs) detract from the album. They are not all bad, but a couple of them (Skating Away, Up the Pool) are seriously off-key. Also the mix was a little heavy toward his voice in some songs. I enjoyed the songs without introductions better than the ones with. Overall, it's pretty good, but if an instrument had taken the lead, instead of Ian's voice, it would have been a major improvement. You can hear much better versions of him singing on other CD's."
1,unsatisfied,I oredered this in Nov for a xmas present only to receive a notice the week before that you could not fill the order not happy @!
1,"Very disappointed--high price for a 6"" doll and it wasn't like the pic.","Not knowing that there were Cabbage Patch ""minis"" out there, I mistakenly thought that this doll would be larger. The product name should indicate that this isn't a regular Cabbage Patch Kid. The other dolls have names like ""Cabbage Patch Baby"" or other name to indicate that the ""kid"" doll isn't part of their regular full-sized line.Also, the facial features don't match the photo--so if you hate a certain expression in their doll line, then don't buy this product. You just never know what you'll wind up with."
4,Great quantum text for advanced undergrad; begining grad,"So the first 4 chapters of this book are a work of art. They perfect the technique of using spin as an introduction to quantum concepts that Feynman made so famous in his Caltech lectures (yes, that's right, Sakurai did it better). So for understanding the core ideas of quantum the text and exercises (I worked almost all of them) of chapters 1-4 are great.Unfortunately, Sakurai died part way thru this project and it's pretty evident that chapters 5-7 (perturbation, permutations, & scattering) are someone else's doing. They don't really provide any great insight and are poorly organized. At this point; you're probably better off going back to Messiah or Merzbacher. There's also no treatment of relativistic quantum mechanics. An unfortunate end to what starts as a truely great book."
3,"Some great sections, but low quality elsewhere","I agree completely with the general concensus review here: the book is great in the fundamental areas but gets a little sketchy towards the end with the added sections. In particular, the degenerate perturbation section is the worst explanation I've ever seen on the topic. One thing I'd like to add that doesn't seem to get mentioned is that the typesetting of the book is a disaster. It looks like it was produced in Microsoft Word. There are places all over the text where the font size jumps around from paragraph to paragraph. I wish I'd just saved the money and bought the soft-cover version or a used copy. The book's really not nice enough to warrant spending over $100, though the content is good enough that I'd certainly suggest buying a used copy for the early sections that are fantastic."
1,Overrated,"Pretending to be rigurous, this book doesn't even mention Hilbert Spaces, Riesz Lemma, The Spectral Theorem... all of which are key to the formalism of Quantum Mechanics. Many decades have passed since the serious development of the mathematical tools (non-existent by the time Dirac published his book) needed for QM was made. This book totally snubs mathematics (as many physicists still do).(And no, I'm NOT a mathematician)."
3,"Very good, when supplemented","While teaching qm in the seventies and eighties I preferred Baym. A few years ago I decided on Sakurai and did not regret it. It's necessary to supplement the text with many derivations and details, but this book provides an excellent approach to qm in the spirit of Dirac, and provides a very good takeoff point for discussing the famous measurement problem (was there necessary to enlarge the discussion presented in Sakurai). I motivated the transition to qm by using Heisenberg's The Physical Principles of Quantum theory, where he explains how he was motivated in spirit by relativity theory to give up the idea of predictability of simultaneity of position and momentum. I ended the course by going to the literature and working through EPR and an introduction to quantum computation. A severe weakness: Sakurai assumes that the reader has learned elsewhere about the qm of the hydrogen atom!"
4,good,"This book is an excellent resource for the graduate student in physics. It covers many of the advanced topics like path integrals, etc. In the downside, it barely skims over some of the most important topics like the hydrogen atom."
5,Warrors.,"I love the whole series, The firstbook was the best.It really explained it, So if you Luv cats these are the books for you.:)"
3,too many erors but god book,this book is great but when i got it i noticed that there were spaces in the middle of words id still bye it but it needs to be rescanned
5,BEST BOOK IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OMG!!!!! this is SUCH a good book!!! Firestar has just become leader, but learns how hard it is, especially with a new evil in the forest!!! The 4 clans must join together to defeat the evil Bloodclan!!!! I CANT WAIT UNTIL THE NEW BOOKS MOONRISE AND DAWN COME OUT!!!! READ THESE BOOKS!!!!"
5,Thank goodness I read it !,"I so enjoyed the first 5 of the series that, after reading some negative reviews, I didn't want to ""spoil it"" by reading #6. But I did - thank goodness! What I've learned is...not only have I a different view of cats....not only do I so admire the Author....I've learned to ignore negative reviews and make up my own mind (but don't we know that already)? Of course we do!The Book was a perfect ending to the Series. The Author took us back in time to refresh our memories of the characters and their histories - yet all the time moving forward in the Adventures of the Clans. I kept putting the book down to find something else to do in order to make it last. Those who report the book was ""slow"" must live off Microwaved Dinners and Energy Bars. This book is to be savored, one bite at a time...absorbed into the mind and digested with delight - sort of like a good Thanksgiving Dinner. Thanks to Ms. Hunter for the hours of pleasure."
5,Best Book Ever,"This is the best book I ever read in my life. it is full of everything, action, adventure, romance, and a lot more! I love these books and everyone should read them."
2,unrealistic to the world of cats,"I thought this book gave the characters too many human aspects and was overall, pushing a way too unrealistic scenario. Feral cats live with separate territories and it is against their nature to live in 'clans' which I think should've been called prides considered lion prides are the only group of cat that forms in the cat's genetic family. The books plot was too focused on Fireheart who was oddly the only one who could see through Tigerclaws 'oh so complicated' plots. This book is mostly read by a younger audience which is apropriate for the level literacy the author puts into the text."
5,An awesome book!!!,"The Darkest hour is awesome!It is my favourite book in the original series, espesially when Scourge KILLS Tigerstar.Read it a hungred times over!"
5,Awesome...........,"This book I think is the best book in the series and I hope there is another one. Bluestar dies saving her clan from a pack of dogs and Firestar takes over the clan. Shadowclan and Riverclan unite to form Tigerclan and ask Windclan and Thunderclan to join, but they refuse. So Tigerstar asks the new clan Bloodcaln to help fight,but Tigerstar dies in the process by getting ripped apart by the leader's dog nail reinforced claws. In the end Whitestorm dies and Graystripe becomes the new deputy. This is the best book in the series. I loved it and I hope they make it into a movie."
5,5 STARS FOR DARKEST HOUR,THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I EVER READ YOU CAN'T PUT IT DOWN ONCE YOU START BUT TRY TO READ THE OTHERS FRIST
5,R.I.P Whitestorm,Loved it and sooo sad when Whitestorm dies.I think this book is a classic. Firestar lost one life..Everyone should buy this
3,scurge kills tigerstar,"i think this is a great book for children 11 and up. It has some death, and Tigerstar, the evil murderer, the leader of Shadow Clan, Is killed very violently by Scurge. If you dont want me to spoil it, dont read the rest.Scurge has dog teeth attached to his claws, and scratches them against tigerstars belly. tigerstars 9 lives are wasted from loss of blood."
1,Weakest of the Series,"Book 6 is best skipped. Why? Because it takes a very nice, somewhat believable universe, which is also very easy to get sucked into, and suddenly throws in elements which have absolutely no relevance to the reality of said universe. I'd like to know how 1. The cats can put on their own collars. 2. How can they affix dog talons and such to them... and in general... it's a load of garbage. Just skip it."
5,The Chocolate Drops are Sweet and Sassy!,"I have been following the Carolina Chocolate Drops for the last two years, and have been blown away by their talent, their respect and passion for the music and their love for performing. I have never seen a Carolina Chocolate Drops concert where the audience wasn't on their feet by the last song. The band members obviously enjoy performing and bringing this style of music to the listener. And they strive to make you a dancer as well!This album is a wonderful example of what this talented group can do, and what string band music was intended to be...joyous, rambunctious and full of fun. I highly recommend this CD, and encourage you to see this group live if you have the opportunity. They are worth every penny of your admission! But make sure you wear your dancin' shoes...you won't be able to stay in your seat."
5,Some of the best music I've EVER heard.,"I absolutely love this CD. I love that this kind of music is still alive and people of my generation have access to it through this band. Just listen to the samples. It speaks for itself. If you like it, you like it, if you don't well, I think you will. :)"
3,Carolina Chocolate Drops,The Chocolate Drops are good for their age and will improve as they grow older and have more instructions and practice. I have heard better young people as well as many who were not as good. Again I say that with more practice and exposure they will be one of the better groups in the near future.
4,Loved it!,"If you like the raw effect of folk, primitively done and a jam session feel, you will so enjoy this CD. It made me want to drive straight to NC and join in."
4,A promising start for an unusual trio,"I think this is the debut CD for The Carolina Chocolate Drops, and it's a good start. The music seems a little raw, but they're having fun with it. And the men's voices sound somewhat untried - but the tunes rollick along. And I only wish I could sound as good as Rhiannon does!There's a lot of talent in this group, and they're reintroducing a wealth of traditional folk tunes to an audience that have likely never heard them before.And, check out their latest CD, ""Genuine Negro Jig""Genuine Negro Jig."
5,Dorman Control Arms for the SC300/400,"I had Prothane aftermarket bushing in my stock control arms... they were a little too stiff for my liking so I ended up buying new Dormans from Amazon. I currently have only put 1000 miles on it and will update this review when I put more mileage on it. The control arms fit with no problem just like the oem version and the ball joints are good as well. Also, the car rides like it was stock again as well. Dorman offers manufacturers lifetime warranty which is also a +."
2,High Frequency Hum,"Replacement was easy to install. However, there is a high frequency hum that is produced when the lamp is dimmed."
3,It works,"Just like to give my 2 cents worth. Installation was easy enough. The operation of the unit is my concern. There is a lot of dead space between the click of turning on the light to when light is visible. Almost half turn. I have a 150 watt bulb in a 300 watt fixture. Never was a problem before the failure of the previous dimmer switch. This is annoying, but functional."
4,Perfect dimmer repair,This Westek Dimmer Replacement worked perfectly to repair my lamp. I had waited a long time to find this product so my lamp would work again. I am so happy to have found it. The wiring system was slightly different than the lamp I have but with a little adjustment it works great! THANK YOU!
1,"Junk, absolute junk",Got around to installing this switch 6 weeks after purchase. Light did not work. Lamp wiring continuity was good. Switch continuity showed open through the range of the switch. Bad switch right out of the package. Would have had to pay shipping and return postage so returning for a replacement or refund was not an option. Think twice before buying any Westek product. This purchase was a big mistake.
3,A little noisy,"This dimmer is a little noisy when not turned all the way up. I contacted the company for a replacement. They were happy to oblige, but I would have to pay for the shipping there which would be more than the unit costs. The product still works, just noisier than I anticipated."
1,DISPLEASED,i WILL NEVER ORDER ANOTHER PIECE OF JEWELRY FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN. I NEVER REICEIVED MY BRACELET AND IT WAS FOR AN IMPORTANT DAY. I DID NOT GET MY MONEY REFUNDED AND I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER BACK ON HOW I CAN GET IT REFUNDED. HORRIBLE SERVICE AND I'M STILL UPSET.
1,"Eliminate ""Ajax"" from the title","The link to football is minimal. This book focuses much more on the Dutch, the war, and the treatment of Jews than it does on football or Ajax. More importantly, it's just not that interesting."
5,A Classic,Just buy this book for the quality and accuracy of the info on the British army. Bryan Fosten knows his stuff. The drawings are superb!
2,a wayward angle:the full story of the hells angles,"I,am having a hard time keeping my interest in this book about the angels. I really do not care about his school days and he makes the angels sound pretty tame,also he must of had a dictionary on hand for a lot of the word would not be in the angels vocabulary or mine. The only thing I can say is take a chance if you cannot find another book on the angels.After reading ( under and alone) William Queen this angel book is really boring. TR"
3,Dark reading,"a book on the dark side of humanity. Author brought you into the life inside a biker gang. I wouldnt recommend this book for a light read,"
3,wayward angel George Wethern,"from a book stand point it is well written. Very few mistakes. The problem with books of this nature its hard to fathom whats truth and whats not. If you base an opinion on the writers version, thats fine. Yet with other books on similiar topics. Then discrepancies appear."
2,Dated and no great revelations,No great discoveries here. Wethern tells about how much the Hells Angels partied and used drugs in the 70's and the beginning of methamphetamine distribution. The book drags and bogs down. I recommend Under and Alone instead of this book.
3,A defector always has another story,"I found this book to be an average attempt to justify walking away from the HAMC. The Club made him what he became, supported him and assisted him.Being one of the ""founding members"" with Sonny Barger, and Terry the Tramp, but it was his choice to remain in the Club. Then to blame others and ""do a deal"" and hide behind the Feds in the witness protection system when the ""proverbial hit the fan"".Yes there were criminals in the HAMC, no one club can vet all members. George was one too, but chose to look the other way when things got too hot to handle. Sonny on the other hand took his punishment."
1,bologna,AN extremely slanted version of some events in the 60's and 70's that may have involved the author. He talks about drug dealing and glazes over some murders but over all a very boring read that drags on and on without point. There are many many more books about bike gangs that are interesting. Read those instead.
1,Don't get your information from a RAT!,"If you want to read something about the Hell's Angels there is a handful of great books by Sonny Barger, the man himself. This book by George Wethern is unreliable at best! Why, because he is. The authors Integrity is very important when selecting a book and this author, by his own admission, has none. DO NOT support him or this book. He is a lying rat! If you feel you must read it, buy it USED! That way no more money goes to reward a lying rat who stabs his friends in the back to save himself. Whether you like the Angels or not, being a turncoat is not respectable or acceptable."
1,A Waste of Money and Time,"Let me save you the money and time of buying and reading this book. Here it is.....I was an Angel; I used, bought, and sold drugs; I got caught and squeeled on my brothers......Thats about all this book says. It's a waste."
4,"Published in the late 70's, but an interesting read.","Although this was first published almost 3 decades ago, it's still an interesting read. It holds some of the same info/events detailed in Sonny Barger's books, and many extras from the author's point of view.Lots of interesting tidbits about the drug scene in California in the 60's."
3,Interesting Read,"I enjoyed reading this book, but at times it dragged a bit. This is very informative and riddled by many key historical events that made up the Hell's Angels which was great. It was not as good as Under and Alone, but I did enjoy this book very much and recommend it for readers interested in learning about the start of the Hell's Angels and their activities by a major insider."
3,If you've read other books on OMG's...,"It is not a bad book, but if you have read into OMG's in any depth the peripheral information is old news. It is kind of interesting to see things from the author's perspective. If you are a first time reader on OMG's, then I would say buy it and read. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
4,good crime story!,"The story George tells in this book is full of the senseless violence, and the crazinest of the outlaw lifestyle! Book kept myn interest all the way through! Never a dull moment."
4,nice monitor,good valueaccurate colorclean textwould buy againvery happy with purchasethere are better monitors out there but not in this price range.
4,"NEC MultiSync LCD2070NX 20"" LCD Monitor","Great monitor, colors are even and the viewing angles are better than I expected. No back light bleeding, no ghosting, no dead or stuck pics. The swivel base and height adjusting stand make it very easy to setup for comfortable viewing. I just wish I had purchased a second one while it was on sale :)The only thing that stopped me from giving it all 5 stars, is the powered USB hub. When you turn the monitor off, the hub shuts down as well. If you leave an MP3 player,iPOD, or a cell phone attached to charge, you must leave the monitor on. It's not a big issue, as the monitor will blank the screen and go into sleep/power saving mode automatically, with power still going to the hub. I was justed used to turning off my old monitor when I step away from the PC."
4,Black slave becomes top Russian general,"An extraordinary, true story of the African slave who became the favourite general of one of Russia's greatest Tsars. The writer has endearingly woven the story of her own daring journey in his footsteps, from Africa to Sibera and back, with her well researched account of his life. All told with lots of humour and many lively conversations with people she meets on the way. A memorable, slightly eccentric travel book in the Chatwin/ Dalrymple mode."
5,Classic,"This was a great movie. no problems, looks great (digital) I'm glad some old movies are being restored to digital."
2,Zapata non viva,"This was the one film I'd always wanted to see but couldn't find of Kazan/Brando. Now that I have I find I hadn't missed much. It's a miss, save your effort if you are a film buff. Perhaps the best thing about it is that it planted the seeds for Brando to make One Eyed Jacks, one of the great Westerns in my opinion, in Mexico a few years later."
4,Gift for my Father,"I do not have too much to say considering I did not actually purchase the movie for myself, but I wanted to make it clear that the packaging is all in Portuguese an the movie and the menu are in English."
5,ZaPATA !!!,I remember seeing this movie when I was knee high to a grasshopper and I was always waiting ta see it again. I'm glad they came out with it on dvd now I have it with my collection. Thanks!!
1,wrong region,I returned this dvd to seller because it would not play. Screen legend stated it was a region error. I am anticipating a refund. I will be in touch should this not occur as promised by seller. Thank you.
4,viva Zap,"started out true to history. then...... sorta got tangled up in Hollywood. too bad. woulda/coulda/shoulda made a great movie about an interesting REAL hero. Brando needed a better script. But hey, it's Brando. So worth it nonetheless."
1,Zapata,I had to return this DVD because it would not play on my DVD player. I will have to reorder from another source.
4,3 1/2 stars for a character driven historical film,"Fresh off his success in ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" Marlon Brando jumps into this very Americanized Mexican western. He plays Emiliano Zapata complete with a wispy mustache and a persistent scowl on his face. He and his rambunctious brother Eufernio (excellent Anthony Quinn) lead a rebellion over their land rights.After Mexican president-for-life Diaz is eventually run out of the country, the illiterate Emiliano attains leadership. The film, directed by Elia Kazan with a screenplay by John Steinbeck has its share of shootouts and action sequences but is most notable for some of the eloquent dialog provided by Steinbeck. The cast is excellent as well.Jean Peters is the girl Zapata finally marries and I was especially impressed with Quinn and Arnold Moss. Moss plays a power driven recruiter who eventually breaks ranks with the revolutionaries. The film hangs its hat on the moral compass and for the most part succeeds."
5,Evidently the complete movie.,"At least one DVD version of Viva Zapata is known to be incomplete. Shortening of the title credits, and the last few second missing from the last scene.This is NOT that incomplete version. You can order this one with assurance that you are getting the entire movie. The casing itself is in Spanish and not English, but this should not be a problem for most buyers. You even get to figure out what ""Un tranvia llamado deseo"" means.I first saw this film when I was in fourth grade, almost 60 years ago. I did not understand it, but over the following decades I came to appreciate it.ZapataI will not go into detail here describing or analyzing this great film. That has been well done elsewhere. I do suggest that, for further enjoyment and understanding, you acquire John Steinbeck's book ""Zapata"", which includes the shooting script and background details."
2,Movies good but this is a DVD-R!,"This DVD release of The Formula from ""VCI Entertainment"" is a DVD-R, not a factory pressed DVD! The picture is also not as clear as a version I had previously rented from Netflix.I guess it's not a big deal since it's only 4.99 but you would think Amazon would mention somewhere that it's a DVD-R anybody could have pressed on their computer. If I would have known that, I would have just made a copy of the one I rented."
4,A Great Book For Beginners,"As the title implies, this book contains a wealth of knowledge for the beginning angler. Topics include: choosing and purchasing the appropriate equipment, finding a good fishing spot, understanding how fish think and act, bait and lures, casting methods, and fish identification and preparation. Fishing can be overwhelming to the uninitiated, especially when it comes to the amazing array of rods, reels, and tackle available. This book should answer most, if not all, of your questions about fishing."
4,"OK, but missing a lot of the basics.","This book is easy to read, but hard to find specific information. I am a Den leader for eight 10-year old Cub Scouts. I bought the book to help me as a beginner fisherman, to teach my boys the basics. I have been unable to find info on making decisions about the right equipment for the individual fisherman, for given conditions, etc. There was surprisingly little on knots, rigs, choosing hooks, baits, etc."
5,Good book,my brother-in-law and I both enjoyed learning some new tips and techniques from this book... we thought it was aptly named for us
5,Skeeter Skelton - Firearms Writer.,"Skeeter Skelton was a Marine, Amarillo, Texas, police officer, U. S. Border Patrolman, Sheriff of Deaf Smith County, Texas, U.S. Customs investigator, U.S. DEA officer, and most of all, a prolific writer of firearms related stories. His writing's during his lifetime, were not just about firearms, a sometimes dry subject, when presented in technical terms alone, but included the more interesting ""person"" factor which set him apart from other writers. Drawing upon his backgound in Law Enforcement he was able to inform, entertain, and educate his readers in a style which was serious, humerous, and personable. Skeeters' fiction stories are included in this book as well as non-fiction material on real life characters from the Old West. If you are interested in people, firearms, and like to be entertained as well as informed, then read this book."
3,"Good, but not up to the usual standard.","This album (forgive me) is not up to the usual Mathis standards. The songs are generally pleasant, but uninspiring, and Mathis's partnership with Dionne Warwick on ""Friends in Love"" doesn't work as well as, say, Deniece Williams or Jane Olivor. Nonetheless, Johnny Mathis rarely records a bad song, and this album is no exception. ""Memory"", the theme from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats probably stands out as the best cut, with a distinctive Mathis vocal in which the listener feels every word. This album is the sort of album one puts on the record player after a night out to wind down to - and like all Mathis albums - is an ideal romantic soundtrack."
4,Good tint,This is a great tint and moisturizer. I keep it in my purse as a quick touch up to lips when in a hurry. Works well over or under my lip gloss and lipsticks as well. Not to red or heavy.
2,Not that great,"I bought this based on some good reviews, but it wasn't that great. Not worth the price at all. Made my lips feel sticky and I don't think it kept them moisturized at all."
5,The greatest pulpit preacher of his time,"I.H. Levinthal was considered the greatest pulpit preacher of his time. He was passionate and eloquent. His sermons today still are very readable and address often issues which trouble the Jewish community today. He was a person of strong faith in traditional Jewish values, a great community leader and builder, a devoted supporter of building a Jewish state in the land of Israel, a wise person who believed that Judaism has universal messages which can teach and help all of Mankind."
2,I had a few problems with this Harem costume,"We got the medium size costume, (size 8-10) on the chart, for my 8 year-old daughter. It's a too small. Plus the workmanship isn't very good. It has a hole where the top is sown into the flesh-colored midriff. Very disappointing, especially considerig the cost for the costume plus the shipping. I'm trying to decide whether it's worth it to send back, or just take the loss. However, my daughter does like it and does want to wear it despite it being a little small."
3,Liked the beginning the best,"I loved the beginning of this novel. Laura Kinsale and the Gothic hero seem like the perfect combination. Is he insane? Or is someone really trying to kill him? Plus, the letters were charming.But then, the plot went off in a different tangent, and it was as if another story was being told. It's the bizarre plot elements from the latter half keep this from getting a higher grade.The characters are realistic, though they're not Kinsale's best. Or at least not her most interesting. Robert is not a typical Kinsale hero -- and perhaps this plot could have used one of those.Read ""The Flowers of the Storm"" or ""The Shadow and the Star"" for a better Kinsale.Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance"
4,A book definitely worth reading.....,"""My Sweet Folly"" was an interesting read. It opens with these wonderfully sweet letters, and it twists and turns into something completely unexpected. The love scenes in this book were extremely different..there was so much tension between the H/H..it was unbearably erotic and almost desperate when they came together.....I would have given this book 5 stars in a flash, but I feel that the relationship between Folie and Robert was pushed aside too many times to focus on other aspects of the plot..I felt that the book would have been better paced if about 50 pages were shaved off. Also...regarding Melinda...I would have liked for there to have been scenes between her and her ""suitor"".All in all, this was really a great read..if you like Laura Kinsale this book is very typical of her..it doesnt disappoint..and the epilogue couldnt be sweeter."
2,Good start goes downhill fast,"This book began so interestingly and then became weird and contrived, that's the only way to put it. The second Laura Kinsale book I've read that loses steam so badly that the second half of the book almost reads like a completely different book. A shame. I won't try a third Kinsale."
3,Enjoyable,"I did not love this as much as her other books I had read previously but it was an enjoyable read. Her characters are as usual, very intricate and deep. This book truly had me on my toes all along - is he insane or not or basically what the heck is going on? Lots of twists everywhere. I thoroughly loved the ending, it was my favorite part - how he finally told her he loved her, it was very fitting."
2,An exquisitely beautiful beginning; a badly botched ending.,"Kinsale can do better than this. Read this book for the beautiful first half, but be prepared for an ending which goes awry. Few writers of fiction today have Kinsale's talent, but more and more frequently, she cannot pull her plot together at the end. It is both mystifying and frustrating to us Kinsale fans."
1,ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING BOOKS EVER READ.,"The book and the storyline started out great. The characters were perfect, as was the setting. Then it all went wrong. It's amazing to think that something like this was even published. The ending was vulgar and pointless. Did men really refer to women's private parts with modern day profanities back then?!She turned an absoulutely wonderful story into trash. It was my first Kinsale book and my last."
3,Disappointing,"I totally agree with the reader from Texas. I enjoyed the first half of the book then it all went downhill. I'd recommend Kinsale's ""Flowers from the Storm"" I think it's her best."
2,Another Kinsale book that I tried to read,"I really tried to read this book...really. I loved the first part of the book with the correspondance between Folie and Robert, but lost interest when he hid in his closet.I've read most of Flowers from the Storm, the only other Kinsale novel that I've read, and lost interest in that because the hero is *too* tortured. The same goes with this one. I don't want to read of a hero who hides in closets and who is going mad. I will give the author lots of credit for language and beautiful writing. However, I just can't abide all the sorrow. I want to read a romance that is romantic and happy most of the time, not so sad that it makes me, the reader, melancholy. I don't like to write bad reviews, but I just had to put my two cents in about this book. After Flowers from the Storm, I should have known better."
5,Bring Back Alexander Portnoy or I'll Complain!,"I saw Portnoy's Complaint when it first hit the theatres back in the early 1970s. I was just a teenager going through my own trials and tribulations at the time. I didn't give this movie much merit; I didn't realize the validity of this movie until years later, when I got to know a Jewish boy with a so-called ""typical Jewish mother."" Suddenly, it all made a whole lot of sense.Very few movies are uniquely funny, but this movie most definitely is. Alexander Portnoy is a concupiscent Jewish adolescent whose solitary goal in life is to satisfy a very hungry libido in spite of an overbearing mother who nearly drives him to the loony-bin.I have been waiting for this movie to be re-released for many years. This movie is a classic. I'm disappointed that the decision to release it is still in the lurch. That is MY only complaint about this film."
3,Portnoy's Complaint,Did not find this movie all that entertaining. Same feelings today as I had when it first came out. There are a few funny moments but not enough to earn more than 3-stars. I think this is the movie that explains why I never liked Richard Benjamin.
3,No way to soften the blow,"These stories are badI mean not just your average run of mill (haven't I read this somewhere before) bad. No, picture a mirror. Now this mirror is looking good you like the concept you get into a few pages and all is well but then something odd happens. The stories lack the essentials A. Details B. Background info. We are never really told how this war came about just that it happened. We are never given an details about the main players.You expect something good (espically considering that these stories come from someone like Orson Scott Card.)In the end the stories just don't deliver.Bottom Line-Great setup, but the stories make no sense that is what kills ""Folk of the Fringe""."
2,Definitely not Ender's Game,"This book is actually a series of stories. The stories are actually well written, but the religious theme and what happens to some of the kids in them lead me to not recommend this book unless you are prepared to spend a sleepless night or two! Stick with Ender's Saga, Jay."
4,Short story collection set in not-so-distant future,"The reviews to this book have not been so glowing. Obviously, you need to know what you are getting into - this is a collection of 4 or 5 short stories set in a future where a nuclear war has dramatically altered everyone's way of life. Some of the stories are very good. Some are just average. I would recommend it, especially if you're Mormon."
4,Mirror... Mirror... American Reflections,"When American cultures are seen through the eyes of non-Americans, many of those blind spots are revealed.A must read for foreigners who plan to study or settle in the States, for them to anticipate and if you will, a thin buffer to those tingling yet unavoidable cultural shocks.This book is also very useful for Americans to realize why a Fahrenheit is indeed a very bizarre and exotic measuring unit in comparison to Centigrade, a member of the metric family which almost everyone in the rest of the world are now using..."
4,Relaxing with spikes of fear,Very relaxing except for animal hunting scenes that are violent and disturb the ambiance the rest of the video produces; especially for the children.
3,Open Minded Reader,"I would agree that this book was not as good as the first Demonspawn, but I feel it still had a lot to offer. The last three stories were worth the price of the book. Laura Baumbaugh wrote several great stories and the last story was very good also. I think the problem with the first few stories is that they tended to be too wordy(not enough action,boring) and/or out of character. But, all in all, I still enjoyed the last few stories enough not to regret buying the book.If you like this type of action/adventure gay romance story, I would greatly recommend S.Hardy Brondos-Perfect Trust and Perfect Hope. You can check it out at Waywardbooks.com"
2,its the opposite of comfortable,"galco is good stuff generally, but i was not impressed with this holster. it dug into my side. additionally, if you have a wider belt, you have to order additional y-clips. 1-1/2"" is the widest belt possible with this holster. this holster is definitely for the businessman! if youre just looking to ccw, look into the desantis cozy partner. THAT HOLSTER RULZ!!!"
1,Not the book cover as pictured,"Love the Parker series so I thought I was buying this book with the red Lee Marvin book cover you see pictured somewhere on this page. It was described as a British first edition but no where does it really confirm that. Paid over ten bucks for it and it arrived with a 75 cents sticker on the cover. Imagine my surprise. 5 stars for Parker and Lee Marvin, 1 star for the book seller.Btw, the Parker series are fantastic so it's too bad I have to leave a one star review here since I can't change my seller feedback."
5,Best of the Genre,"Without spoiling the plot, just let me say that this book will definitely make you root for the BAD GUY."
1,tripey trite,"I thought this book was absolutely hopeless. Despite the description that Mill was supposed to be strong minded, I thought she never demonstrated this and especially at the end where she allowed herself to be bullied into agreeing with that bossy and self-important hero. Not very dignified, let alone romantic at all! J.L. has managed to maintain the dignity of her heroines in other books having a similar premise, such as ""You Belong To Me"" but ""Joining"" didn't allow this. Mill and Wulf only seemed to be obsessed with arguing about each other's habits in a flimsy attempt to substitute for plot. Lastly the word ""joining"" was used about every 5 pages for some reason. I found such repetition unnecessary and very annoying. If you must read this, get it from the library like I did. Not worth the $."
2,Weak and Disappointing,"Johanna Lindsay is one of my favorite authors and I have read every single one of her novels. However, this book is definitely not one of her best works. It lacks tension and passion. The characters are flat and one dimensional. I could not understand how the main characters fell in love. At one moment, they hate each other, then the next thing I knew, they are madly in love.When I read Lindsay's past novels, I got very emotional, teary and could not put the book down. With Joining, it was just the opposite. I was just plain bored and it felt like the novel would never end.Hopefully, her next story would be better."
1,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Johanna Lindsey's work for over a decade, and I can honestly say: If stranded on a desert island, the only two books available were ""Joining"" and ""The Art of Watching Grass Grow"", I would be using the pages of ""Joining"" to kindle a fire while tending to the lawn I've grown on the sand!This was Ms. Lindsey's poorest effort to say the least. The characters were uninteresting, the plotline thin, the love unconvincing...and I found myself struggling to complete the story in hopes of finding some redeeming feature. Alas, there was none to be found.I would still recommend Lindsey's work, just skip this title."
3,"Not as fast-paced, but a worthy read.","Although certainly not one of Johanna Lindsey's greater works, this book certainly has its merits. The sexual tension is prevalent between Wulfric and Milisant, but there's more fighting than loving. It is only at the very end that the couple discovers how much they love one another.There isn't as much action and adventure, but the plot and time-period were well-researched. In this Lindsey novel, the reader has to admire Milisant's desperate attempts to be accepted for who she is rather than who everyone else in the book wants her to be. Wulfric comes to understand this better than anyone, which is probably why the two fall in love.All in all, the book is worth the read, but I would not recommend it if one is looking for a constant adventure. But if the reader is searching for a tale of love and acceptance, pick it up and prepare for a long afternoon of reading enjoyment."
3,Mediocre,"This book definitely had the potential...it was a beautiful story. It just lacked the interaction between the hero & the heroine. There should have been more scenes between them instead between Mili & her twin sister or anybody else for that matter.For what its worth, however little scenes between Wulf & Mili, were good. I especially liked the part where she dresses like a boy and he threatens to dress her himself is she doesn't change. And how she fools him into thinking she's her twin...more than once.Give it a try, maybe you will like it. Not as good as Gentle Rogue / You Belong To Me...but still a worthwhile read."
2,Joining,To sum it up....Bland. I was kind of disappointed. Ms. Lindsey has been my favorite author since I started reading romances and I was expecting a better read. Let's just hope she's in a slump that she'll snap out of quickly.
2,Snoreville,"Have you ever driven in your car for a long distance and when you finally reach the last couple of miles, you gun it to get home faster? Well, that's what I did with this book. I read the last chapters really fast just so that I could finish the book because I could't wait to close it up forever.Johanna, I am very dissappointed. The story line was predictable and the characters are weak. The constant use of italics was very annoying. Just open up to any page and you will find italicized words on most pages.I felt that the main characters, Milisant and Wulfric, didn't get to know each other. They didn't talk to each other so I don't understand how they fell in love with each other.I am trying very hard to think of some positive things but I am unable to."
2,Could be much better,I have read all her books. I likes all her books from Captive Bride to Man of My Dream. All her newest books are so boring. I would loves it if she continue to write the same style she had been written for so many years. Very disappointed of her book recently. It could be much better.
3,not at all what I had expected.,"I'm a johanna lindsey fan, maybe one of her biggest. So telling you of my disappointment in her most recent book is saying a lot for me. It was not one of her best. Very slow in the beginning with a dull finish. Nothing in this book really held my attention. I read romance novel for the romance. I need foreplay, love, romance. Characters that have energy. ""The Joining"" had none of this or at least not enough. I'll stick to her old stuff for the excitement."
2,Should have waited for the paperback version,"What happened? I must say, Joining was quite a disappointment! While I do applaud her attempt to break away from her usual fare, and all too familiar stories and characters, I was just plain bored with this book. It seemed that this book was composed of subplots and no real primary plot. Milisant and Wulfric were just uninspiring and bland. If we must wait a while for her next novel, we will wait. The way she is churning them out it's no wonder there was nothing special or interesting about Joining nor the last couple of books (the last Mallory novel was disappointing, too). So, take your time, Johanna, and put some thought, heart, and humor into the next one, hmm? I know you are capable of fantastic stories and great dialogue, i.e., Gentle Rogue."
4,Not enough character development,Although I have loved Johanna Lindsey's earlier novels this one is not up to her ususal standards. The characters seem flat and one dimensional. There are many areas that could have been developed to add body to the story such as the Milisant's gift with animals and Jhone's ability to sense the emotions of others. The only real background to the characters is the one childhood incident which left both Wulfric and Milisant unwilling to marry. The change in their relationship happens much too easily for two such strong willed characters. A good beach read but I would reccomend waiting for the paperback edition.
3,Not her best,"I am a huge Johanna Lindsey fan. I was slightly disappointed in this book however. I wasn't drawn to the hero and the heroine seemed kind of hard to like. Although her characters were not up to par in this book, I still enjoy her writing style and will buy her books again."
1,Wouldn't suggest this book to others.,"I have enjoyed some of her previous books, but this one could not compare with them. I thought the charactures were shallow, although they fought very well with each other and I enjoyed the fights. I didn't feel that the main charactures were really in love. The supporting charactures were great."
2,Not up to Ms. Lindsey's normal standard.,"I have every book Johanna Lindsey has ever written and I have loved every one. However, this last one was disappointing. Additionally, I regret that I paid the price of the hardcover for it. I should have waited until it came out in paperback. I know she can do much, much better, and I am waiting for her next book."
1,A Big Disappointment,"Ms Lindsay was the first romance writer that I had ever read and became one of my favorites, I could always count on her to take me away for an afternoon to another place and time...However this is NOT one of her usual great stories....nothing seemed to jell here at all....the plot was not that exciting and by the time Mili realized that she was in love with Wulf the book was almost over...too much ""dead space"", not enough dialogue between the characters....Ms Lindsay has written strong willed women before, but Mili was like a spoiled child, who wanted to do things her way all the time....I had a hard time finishing this book, but did hoping it would get better...Not one of her usual ""can't put it down"" stories....."
4,I enjoyed it!,"While it does lack the passion of most of her other books, I still really enjoyed the story. I wish there would have been more scenes with Milisant and Roland. I found the story quite entertaining...even without the graphic sex. I'm anxiously awaiting her next book."
4,Lindsey delivers,"This is a good book. There is wit and romance to spare in this fun tale of two people who must get married but don't want to. They slowly change their minds. There is also danger, which adds a nice twist to the tale. Well done!"
3,joining,"Like all my favorite authors, Linsey has lost her touch. Every time I find an author I really like, two things happen. 1.They start coming out with hardcovers because of their previous success. 2. Their hardcore novels are generally badly written. It is something I still can't figure out but it happens every time. Maybe they figure we loved their previous books so much we will shell out for at least their first 2 hardcovers so they don't have to put that much effort into them! I have learned my lesson. Either wait for paperback, or put my name on the list at the library. If her books keep up like this, it won't be that long of a list."
3,"YAWN!!!!!!! It's ok, can't say it was bad or it was good","Johanna Lindsey's books are usually so exciting and well-planned. This plot is nice to think about, but it just took forever to the romancing! Half the book was boring and the book picked up when Millicent(is that spelled right?)went to her friend's and Wulfric(is that spelled right?) found her. What happened to Lindsey's style and flair? Her previous books were fantastic, especially her Malory series. The Malorys were simply wonderful. If I was her, I would write another Malory book. The Joining was ehhh...really missing Lindsey's spark. The plot should have been more well-planned. I recommend reading this, but don't buy it! Borrow it from a friend or the library. That's what I did. It is simply not worth the money."
2,Far from the best,"Far from the best story she's ever written. It took me days to finish it, where I usually start and finish one of her books in a couple of hours. It was far too boring. Where were the strong lead characters she usually writes about? After waiting months for this latest release, I am very disappointed. I hope the next one will be up to her usual dynamic style."
3,Good reading on a boring day.,"I'm a big fan of Johanna Lindsey. I've read all of her books. This book doesn't tug at your emotions like her earlier books, but it did have its moments. This is a book that I would read again, especially when there's nothing to watch on TV."
4,Easy rainy day read...,"This book was nice and easy to read. I tore through it in one day. Milisant and Jhone are sisters and there are alot of funny scenes between them. Wulfric is the hero of the story and I would have liked to have gotten to know him a bit better, but what I did read I liked. There is hardly any sex scenes in this book, for sensuality I'd give it a 3. There is some tension between Wulfric and Milisant, but not too much. Things went pretty easy for both of them. I'd would be interested to read a story about sister Jhone!"
3,Dialect Confusing!,"I gave the book to my mother as a birthday present last month. Although the background for this novel take place during Medieval period (England 1214), she could not understand the language the characters say in the story. After she told me this, my summary indicate that you need an English dictionary to pronounce (sound out) the words."
2,Passionate- - NOT!,"Amazon has accurately summed up the plot for you, I just want to say that as one of her biggest fans (I've read ALL of her books), I was extremely disappointed. It lacked passion until almost the very end. The dialogue was bland and the former tomboy's metamorphis in to a beautiful lady (considering how she supposedly lived all her life) was not very convincing. I think Johanna whipped this one out with very little thought or interest. I was disappointed. But, everyone gets to have a bomb every now and then. I'll give her another chance!"
3,Taming of the Shrew Redux,"I generally enjoy most Johanna Lindsey books, and this book didn't actually disappoint me. It just didn't inspire me, either.The story is that the heroine and the hero are betrothed, and neither wants to be. The heroine is a major tomboy - a big no no for medievil times. The hero doesn't want to be trapped with such a screw-up. While this storyline isn't exactly original, it can still be fun to read.Both the hero and the heroine are not exactly unlikable either. There's no physical violence perpetrated by the hero on the heroine to ""tame"" her. Instead, it's more just the idea that she needs to compromise more to fit with what society expects, and that the hero should be understanding.Basically, this book has all the ingredients of an excellent Johanna Lindsey romance, it's just basically tepid. No spark or fire. If you love Lindsey, you will probably like this. You just may not love it."
2,A bit disappointing,"Whilst I normally enjoy Johanna Lindsey, I found this disappointing compared to her previous books. There doesn't appear to be as much romance as usual and the story in general was a trifle boring. As an avid Johanna Lindsey fan, I hope her next attempt will be better"
2,Joining,"As my first Johanna Lindsey novel, I was very disappointed with her lack of continuity with character definition from one chapter to the next. In Joining, Milisant was a very strong, independent female until the author needed her to be a star-struck no backbone teary female pliable at every need. I was not impressed with this novel."
3,Joining,"This is a good book, but not a great book. For people who do not care really for books with sex in them then you would probably like this book. There is also very little romance scenes between the couple. So it is kinda hard to figure out how they fall in love when they spent little time together, and don't like each other to start with. Although we all like to believe that if you find that special someone, even if you do not spent a lot of time with them, you will know they are the one. Not a lot of subtain or character built up to the book. It was a quick read for me even being 400 pages and I did not really find anything wrong with the book like others people did. All in all I did not find it a waste of time, but it will not be up there in my list of top books. Defy Not the Heart was definitely better."
3,Story lacked character development,"I enjoyed this book. but I found myself not quite as enthralled in it like I am some of Lindsey's other books. I think that the story had a good foundation behind it, but it did not live up to its full potential. so much more could have been done with this story to make it more romantic. I found the lack of romance and interaction between the two characters Millie and Wulfric to to be very disapointing. They did not have enough moments for me to actually see why they fell in love with eachother. but over all this by far was not a horrible book. It was entertaining, just not quite as romantic and developed as i would have liked."
3,Typical,"Maybe it's just me, but of all the medievals I've read, they all seem to have a woman who doesn't want to be a woman, and a man who will marry her anyway. I get how this pretty much has to happen in order for the modern reader to identify with the woman, since we are so culturally different, but it gets a bit tiresome.On the plus side, the plot was a good one, if somewhat typical, and I enjoyed seeing King John featured.Wasn't a bad book, just not one of my favorites."
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"This is the worst book of Lindsey's I've read. I didn't like the characters, the plot, anything! I'm just happy I checked it out from the library. Ms. Lindsey has been slipping for a while, but this book was terrible. If I could, I would have given it no stars!"
3,Good but not great,"I love Johanna Lindseys books, but this is not one of her best(mediocre really) but still enjoyable. The story was weak but the characters were interesting. Wulf and Mili had a very unpleasant meeting as children and neither wanted to marry the other. The best thing about the book is how they gradually came to know each other as adults, and found out they could like and respect each other. Slowly their romance built in a much more realistic fashion then you normally see. The rest of the book is pretty standard, with even the villain(s) not causing much excitement or worry.For Lindsey fans out there, there is no way you're going to pass on one of her books.(Just as I didn't) But know that she has definitely written better. Let's look forward to 'The Heir' shall we!"
2,A dissapointment but still worth the read . . .,"Given the past success of Lindsey, I would not rate this book as one of her better novels. It seemed childish and lacking in detail (I still don't know what the heroine looked like - I don't think she was ever described). There wasn't much of a spark between the main characters and some major plot holes in how the heroine thinks and behaves, not to mention the weak plot conflict. Still, it is a Lindsey and the great dialogue, as usual, makes for a fast and somewhat interesting read -- it's worth the time, if not the money so check your library first. I hope that with this May publication, she is returning to a May/December publishing schedule. I'm looking forward to more Malory stories."
3,Joining,I have read all of her medevil books and I really liked all the others but this one bored me I found myself skipping pages just so I could finish.
2,Dissappointing,"I have read all of Ms. Lindsey's novels and this one was a huge dissappointment. It dragged on and on. I felt that I was short changed out of a true Lindsey novel. We never really get to know Wulfric, in true Lindsey hero fashion, and Milli, well she seemed too hot headed for our heroine. Talk about a deadline book. Honestly, I have loved all her books except this one-it lacked the fire of a true Lindsey. We're all allowed a mistake or two, this one is definitely that."
2,Not so Good,"I really enjoy all of her books. But this was not one of her best. I did like it some what, but no nearly as good as the others."
3,"Not her best, but C'mon! There are worse! Still a Lindsey!","An uneven book, but with its moments. I believe she was trying for the characters to act like real people, not soap opera extremes, a hard task. She accomplished it with the hero; he's occassionally thoughtlessly pushy but can take criticism and change his behavior. Learns from his mistakes!The heroine had some problems. Definitely too modern for the setting. Too extreme in her rejection of femine roles, and without sufficient justification. Takes her twin sister for granted- not attractive. (Twin is a cardboard cut-out foil for her anyway; boring!)Still I'd rather have authors try to make their characters into real people than read another needlessly emotional rollercoaster of a plot because of childish misunderstandings.And it was nice to see the Fitz Hughs again, even briefly! (See Defy Not The Heart- her best!)"
3,~Could Have Been Better ~,"Joining was a disappointment...it didn't have any of Lindsey's usual spunk. The book seemed to have been written in a rush. It started out well but soon began to lose its interest. The book ends with the characters in love one instant while a moment before they weren't. The plot was weak, and frankly, so were the love scenes!!!! Lindsey usually writes great novels with compelling characters but Joining is not one of them. Pass on this one...try readying the Malory family's trilogy instead....they're well worth your money!!!!"
1,Pass this one by,"I was very disappointed in this book. It had none of the fire of most of Lindsay's other books. A complete formula book, in which every step was highly predictable."
2,"Certainly not Ms. Lindsey best, but it was OK.","The heroine, Mili, is the most stubborn and immature woman I've read about in a long time. I couldn't find anything to like about her. Wulfric, the hero, must have seen something I didn't because he went thru with a wedding for the sake of family friendships. I wish the book had been in paperback, then I wouldn't have minded spending so much money for a book I had to make an effort to read."
3,"Disappointed, not a keeper","Johanna Lindsey has always been a favorite of mine but I was terribly disappointed in Joining. The characters lacked the affection I'm use to in Lindsey's books and the ending left you wondering why you read the book in the first place. Not hardback material, but I'll give her another chance given her past books. I'm wondering if she had a deadline and rushed through it."
1,Just plain bad!!,The characters were unoriginal and the plot predictable. Definately not one of Johanna Lindsey's best. Don't waste your time or money on this one check out her earlier works instead.
3,Not Lindsey's Best Book,"I was disappointed with this book. I love J.L.'s books, but this story line could not hold my interest. The hero and heroine fell in love a little too quickly for my taste and the reason they hated each other from their childhood, to me, was not reason enough to make them hate each other through the years."
4,Parmak MARK8 Low Impedance 110/120-Volt 30-Mile Range Electric Fence Charger,"The Mark 8 Fence Charger has exceeded my expectations. This will not only kill weeds and grass that grows into the fence, but also keeps working when dead branches from surrounding trees fall on the fence.The pulsating charge will not harm most birds when they touch a ground, unlike the continuous charge that most old chargers have.The Mark 7 lasted about three years of continuous use. I hope the Mark 8 will last at least that long, if not longer.Yes, the price is a little high, but compared to the lesser expensive models, this is much more dependable for a longer duration."
5,From being killed to a killer,"This is an amazing story. This book is billed as the second of a trilogy. Yet, this book is not tied to the first book at all except as the holocaust as the backdrop. this time it is a young Zionist that has been given the duty of executing a British soldier being held captive in retaliation against the British for sentencing one of their leaders to death. Dawn explains the other side of the story of the one holding the gun upon somebody instead of having it held upon them. Instead of surviving as in ""Night"", ""Dawn"" is about duty. The young man struggles with his conscience over his duty and his feeling of empathy for his hostage. This is an excellent read and stands apart and alone from the first book ""Night""."
4,DAWN,I thought that this was a great book for young adults and should be put on every school's reading list
3,"Not quite acurate, but good attempt",I bought this book for a Tatar class I was taking. The teacher was a native Tatar from Kazan and said that there were many discrepancies in the translations. Still it did help for some of the work.
2,The Canadian Brass are so much better than this...,"Some music ages well. This album has not. It sounds like a collection of cheesy 1980's TV theme songs. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with the musicianship of the Canadian Brass. Unfortunately, the arrangements are extremely dated, filled with strange synthesizer sounds and silly techno beats. The Canadian Brass are at their best when they're playing great classical and jazz music like no other ensemble in the world. This offering feels rather pedestrian for their immense talents. Though there might be a hint of quirky charm for some, I'm hard pressed to recommend this album to anyone except the most die-hard of Canadian Brass fans who might want to complete their collection. Otherwise, listen to their other recordings first."
3,One of Harold Lloyd's Better Talkies,"Despite the efforts of director Leo McCarey, ""The Milky Way"" (1936) was unable to reverse Harold Lloyd's box-office decline in the sound era. Nevertheless, it's a pleasant screwball comedy with some memorable sight gags for Harold as a timid milkman turned prizefighter. The incomparable Adolphe Menjou steals the show as crooked Gabby Sloan. In his 1936 review for ""The Spectator"" magazine, Graham Greene summed up the amiable blandness of Lloyd's talkie persona: ""One is more amazed than ever at the good fortune of this youngish man whose chief talent is not to act at all, to do nothing, to serve as a blank wall for other people to scrawl their ideas on."" Though he gave ""The Milky Way"" his best shot, the bespectacled comedian never recaptured the brilliance of his silent classics."
2,"A Couple of laughs, but nothing like ""The Freshman""","The Milky Way is a Harold Lloyd 'talkie' (from Paramount). As a milkman, he inadvertently gets into a scrap with a boxer and promoter/manager, one evening, when Burleigh (Harold Lloyd) goes to meet his sister, after she gets off work.This movie may get a laugh or two from you, if you're an HL fan,but after that, there's just too much waiting/anticipating for Harold's next scene.Now, unlike the silent ""The Freshman"", produced eleven years earlier, The Milky Way pales terribly in comparison, in the area of quality 'belly laughs', and also as a 'quantity' movie, having too many scenes without the silent era star. The Milky Way provided me with only a couple, if any laughs. Still, a fun movie to watch with family, but try to go with the older stuff, if you can find it."
3,It's not bad.,"I just got this album about a month ago and I still like it, so that's a good sighn. I'm new to this band so I'm not shure if this is their best or their worst album, but I am shure that the production is excellent, and OOMPH! is certainly capable of some good hard rock music. My only complaint is that many of the songs sound the same. This album has both english and german lyrics."
4,Richard Band at his best!,"This is a tremendous representation of Richard Band's talents. Despite being two low-budget horror films, Band creates lush, beautiful themes which he uses to great affect.The first score represented on this CD, ""The House on Sorority Row,"" is much like Band's other works of the horror genre. He creates eerie, dissonant horror cues and pulse-pounding action to accompany the two lush main themes.The second score, ""The Alchemist"" is worthy of five stars. The two main themes are very beautiful, one of them even heartbreaking at times, and the two themes are used unsparingly throughout the score, creating what sounds more like drama than horror.All in all, if you're a fan of film music, you should pick this CD up if find you it. It's well worth it."
3,Born Again,"I got this album purely on spec, based on Amazon's related interest feature and on the strength of the reviews I saw. As such, I must say that this isn't quite the genre of metal I normally seek out: I'm more of a power and/or melodic and/or folk listener at heart. Strictly in terms of black metal ""sound"" (this being an Unblack band, after all) I find little to fault this group for. Message-wise, it's no surprise that metal, especially the heavier stuff, is better suited to delivering so-called Jeremiads (especially the sinners burning in hell part) than espousing the positive aspects of Christianity. To be perfectly honest, this is not an album I intend to keep, but I do believe it will make a fine addition to the library of a friend who's much more into the blackened side of the spectrum. Right music, wrong listener (me)."
5,Excellent Value and Speedy Delivery,I received this book in good condition and in a very timely fashion (about a week after ordering it.) The price was affordable as was the shipping and handling charges.
4,Fun once you learn the moves,"It took watching the tape three times to learn the moves, but it was fun learning! They're not difficult, but the pace is fast. The music is energetic, and the dance moves are great! You can really get into the rhythm and get your heart pumping. If you have the patience to learn the moves, you should have fun with this tape. The 30 minutes goes by fast!"
4,Que Bueno,"The instructor does a great job of breaking down somewhat difficult moves. The cast is all upbeat and inspiring. Give yourself a few times to get the moves down but once you do, que bueno!"
1,The Fast and The Frustrated,"I wanted a 30 minute workout to combine with my 55 minute workouts I do three times a week, so I bought this tape. I thought this would do it. NO WAY!!!! I didn't break a sweat. The instuctor doesn't explain the moves at all. The moves are to fancy... to fast... and you have to concentrate extremely hard to even keep up. There are so many moves I couldn't keep up. The music was nice but the people in the video are annoying. Don't waste your money on this tape."
2,I felt so out of place!!! In my own living room!!!,"Starting with the pros. I love Crunch videos, the teachers are usually great, and entertaining. They are encouraging with out being wierd. I feel the same about this video, Gloria Quinlan was very engaging. However I am no latina dancing mama, and you need to be to keep up with her.All the women on the tape were amazing, they were bustin' moves this little white girl shreeks at the idea of. If you are a dancer, than I'm sure you will enjoy this tape. If you are not, you will enjoy watching them run circles around you!I am in shape and enjoy working out, but this one was not for me."
1,Latin goes Lackluster,"I bought this tape a few years ago and do it every once in a while. It isnt high impact and i dont break much of a sweat. The moves are pretty easy to get down. I dot feel like i am working up a sweat though, and when the tape is over i dont feel at all winded. Its NOT a good fat blaster tape. And you can barely hear the music. Dont waste your $$$"
2,Why didn't I listen to the reviews???? Awful!,"I'm sorry, REALLY SORRY I didn't pay attention to the reviews when I bought this video. I thought I could manage to do the steps and I really wanted to like this tape. I've been doing aerobics and other forms of exercise several times a week for 10 years and I STILL cannot manage to learn these dance steps. I have other tapes with this instructor and she is GREAT, so I don't think it's totally her fault. I partially blame the camera crew who won't pan down long enough for anyone to learn the steps. This video is insane! Buy Cardio Salsa, Latin Grooves-- or even the Macarena workout instead!"
2,"Moving to quickly, without the right que.","I found this workout to be very frustrating. The instructor constantly tells you to pay attention throughout the tape, however she does not instruct you as to what the new moves are as she changes throughout the routine. The angles of the camera were not that great, therefore it was hard to follow all of the moves."
1,Not Worth the Money!,"If you're looking for motivation, Crunch: Fat Blaster Goes Latin is not for you! As the review says, you can't hear the music over the annoying voices, and the music wasn't of latin origin. Gloria moves from step to step at such a fast pace, that even the most experienced dancer would have trouble staying with her. If you want to learn latin dance steps, this is an ideal video. It should fall under dance instruction instead of exercise/fitness. I felt it was a waste of money."
2,fat blaster? more like concentration blaster!!,"I was very excited when i brought this video home but was a bit disappointed by it. first of all, watch this video 2 or 3 times before you try it because the instructor goes really fast and if you blink you miss a move- well you miss most of the moves anyway even if you don't blink!! the only challenge in the video was keeping up with the instructor who does not even take the time to explain every move; she just goes on and on as if she expects you to know all the moves already. the workout does however work up a sweat! i felt like i was going through my first ever latino dance experience where no one bothered to show me how to make the moves!"
2,Not The Best!,The instructor was cheerful and motivating but the camera angles were off and it was hard to keep up with the moves. Don't waste your money.
2,there are better latin videos,"This video was ok. The set and the instructor are likeable but the instructions were horrendous - you had no idea where she was going until she was already into the next move. I agree with another viewer - Kathy Smith's Latin workout is MUCH better than this - better instruction, more authentic Latin music & moves as well. But for 10 bucks, it's not bad if you just want another tape to keep you from getting bored."
1,Not worth it at any price,"This is the worst workout video I have ever seen. The choreography is way too complicated and the instructor doesn't help much. She tries to, I guess, by frequently saying ""pay attention to the change"", but it would be better if she actually told you what the change was going to be BEFORE she added another move. To make things worse, half the time the camera only shows her from the waist up, which is totally useless as you are trying to figure out what her feet are doing. I'm no Ginger Rogers, but I'm not a total klutz either - trying to follow the moves on this tape is just a waste of time. Even if you could follow, this is by no means a ""Fat Blaster"" workout. The intensity isn't high enough to even break a sweat. You could spend your time a lot better doing anything else."
2,Uncoordinated? Don't bother.,"I really wanted to like this video - I was really excited about adding a little Latin flair to my workout. Let me just say that when my hubby and I previewed this video our mouths dropped open when we saw the fast pace of this video with NO instruction at all! How are you supposed to dive right in like that - especially when you're out of shape and NOT a dancer - and be expected to learn the moves? I tried this video - and had to rewind it just to get a good workout! I tried so hard the first time to get the moves, but found myself confused most of the time. The second time I just ended up (in certain parts of the video) doing my own thing just to get a sweat going. I love the instructor - I think she is so pretty and full of energy - but she needs to slow down and take the time to teach you the move! It was like they had all taken a triple dose of ritalin that day! There was no way I could keep up. So, I'm afraid that this video will be collecting dust at my house."
2,CRUCH CARDIO SALSA AND BRAZILIAN WORKOUT ARE MUCH BETTER,"The instructor does way too much commenting after each step,""nice"", ""very nice"", ""good"", ""very nice."" It's annoying. The moves are somewhat disjointed. This is really not a very authentic Latin piece. It's okay if you just want to move fast and burn a few calories in an uncoordinated way. BUY CRUNCH CARDIO SALSA AND BRAZILIAN DANCE WORKOUT INSTEAD; THEY ARE MUST HAVES!!!!!!"
2,Cheerleader Wannabe's,"The reviews are really all over the place on this one. I am amazed at all the reviews that say this video is too difficult to follow. I found the moves to be very basic and did not work up too much of a sweat. It felt like it lasted about 15 minutes. However, I couldn't get past all of the women whooping and hollering through the entire video. I have dozens of videos including several latin ones and have never experienced that. It distracted me so much I could hardly concentrate on the instructor. If I heard, ""Whoo, Whoo. Oh yeah,"" one more time I was going to throw something at the TV. They acted like Cheerleaders at a junior high dance. I would never be able to show my face in public again if I was one of these dancers. This was so annoying that I don't know if I'll be able to do this video again, even though I thought the instructor did a good job and the choreography was interesting if not a challenging enough workout."
1,THE kITSCHMEISTER REVEALED,Schnabel's career proves that one can indeed fool some of the people all the time. The reproductions of his paintings will show you how many collectors with more money than taste bungled in their esteem for this hack.
2,It takes two,It takes two to use this book and I am not able to get him to the table. I wish there was something I could buy that he would read. Then maybe he would come part way. So far this ain't the book for me. Make sure both of you are willing to work together before you buy this book.
2,Only if you like trivia,"I bought this book when I needed to draw up a document for child custody privileges. It was full of meaningless little snippets, like ""will you let your child drive when he/she is 16"". I needed a 'meat and bones' guide to write a document that would hold, and this book didn't help me. I guess when my children are 16 I'll need that info, but for now it was just a waste of money."
5,Exactly what we needed at the right time,This book gave us exactly what we needed and wanted when we realized that we had to sort out custody and parenting issues. We adapted the worksheets to our own situation and have created a parenting plan that we both agree on. What a blessing!
2,Snssung d807 doesn't fit well,"I bought this for my new Samsung slider phone (which I love) but this case is to snug for it. The slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out. It's a cute case, I would love to use if it was just a little larger."
3,Mixed bag,"This is yet another Webster compilation CD. The first 7 cuts are great. Kenny Drew & Pedersen do a great job of backing BW. BW is at his most breathy on this CD - I like it. The rest of the CD, recorded in the same studio a couple weeks later, has some other horn players that couldn't make the cut in a high school jazz band in the middle of Kentucky.You can get most of the first cuts on ""There is No Greater Love"" - also the mastering is a bit (pun intended) better. One more thing - the track listings and credits on the ""In Copenhagen"" CD are wrong. Took me about an hour to figure it out. OK bozo brains - let's count 1, 2, 3.... The ""There is No Greater Love"" CD got it correct.One additional note - some of the cuts also appear on: ""Tenor Titans"" and ""The Jeep is Jumping""."
3,expected louder sounds,These were okay but expected louder sounds. Would buy additional ones if there were more songs and they were a bit louder
5,Kojak: Season One,"I just finished watching all the episodes of Season One,and I have one question: When is Season 2 coming out?I am a die-hard Kojak fan, ever since the show firstaired. Of all the police shows I have watched over the years,coming from a law-enforcement family, Kojak is the best Ihave seen.Please tell me how I can obtain information as to whenSeason 2 will be available for sale.Thanks very much."
2,I love Kojak!,"I love Kojak, and I hate Universal. No more season releases? What a joke! Will someone else please buy the rights from Universal and release the other three seasons?"
4,Who Luvs Ya Baby? I do!,"The Kojak television series aboutthe case by case work of New York Cityhomocide police detective Theo Kojakis great television.The first season of the series was filmed on locationin New York City and that is one of the thingsthat makes these programs great.The characters are interesting, diverse and believable.In particular, the bald, well-dressed, Greek,lollipop-sucking tough guy, Kojak.The quality of the film technique is superiorto what you'd expect of television serials.The look, sound and acting make this seriesworth viewing and timeless.The plots are good given the limitations of televisionand the guest stars are a who's whoof future television and movie stars.The pop culture of the 1970's is on full displaythroughout these programs adding another dimensionof interest to the shows for me,although some might find it off-putting,especially those too young to have experienced it.These 22 episodes of the Kojak television seriesare great entertainment.Highly recommended."
5,A Great Series I Will Always Love,There is no Kojak unless it is Telly Savalas. He is Kojak. Just like Raymond Burr was Perry Mason. I love the new release of Season 1 and I hope all seasons will be released as I will buy them all. This is one of my most favorite crime shows and I hope to see other episodes from other seasons. At least I have season 1
4,Telly-he is cool!!,"Telly Savalas is Kojack.Cool,hip cop with an attitude that says -''look out''.This is a role that Telly was meant to play!!When he asks-""who loves you baby'?--the only answer is--WE DO !!!!!"
4,NICE...,"very good release overall. really the best and only essential kojak season to release. Season 1 was shot on location in NYC and was very authentic for that reason. the following seasons the show shot out of Los Angeles , and that along with poorly written and anti climactic story lines makes seasons 3 to 5 basically throwaways. Hopefully the studios will release the other essential 70's crime dramas. having already released 2 seasons of the drek that is Columbo, 70's crime drama fans deserve to have ( Mannix, Streets of San Fran, Cannon and the Mod Squad) on DVD format. bring it on"
1,Waited for years and finally it's there!,"Universal Home Video finally brought us season 1 of Kojak!Wanted to buy all season as this is still one of the best, if not THE best, show ever! It seems Universal Home Video is only interested in makin'a quick buck as the original music is NOT there. Afther I've seen what a very poor job they did with The Waltons DVDs I'm not gonna get this set and will patiently wait for another distributor! On top of that they are not planning to put the other seasons on DVD! :( You wont be getting my moneyUniversal Home Video!"
4,Kojak's Back,"A long overdue release, the series may be over 30 years old but still an iconic series as a cop show with great characters.Ahead of its time but still one of the best. Nothing much in the way of extras but good value nevertheless."
3,"AMAZING SOUNDTRACK, but could have been better.","I gotta say, Bruce Broughton did an amazing job on the music, and it deserves 5 stars BUT there are some flaws.First off, its missing two songs that could have easily fit into the CD. One is when Sassy is in the river, the other is when Shadow is injured under the train tracks. The music is great in those scenes so i don't see why they would just not put them on there which is quite disappointing considering they had room.Another thing is the price. wow, rare indeed, you cant even download this one online!I paid [...] bucks for this soundtrack because i love the music and it was worth it too me.Other than the missing tracks and price, its an great soundtrack."
4,there's no turning back now,"This book had perhaps the biggest philosophical question in Animorphs history. It was reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove: can you justify killing dozens of helpless people if it was to save the planet? It was really a page turner, just like all the Animorphs books, and I would definitely recommend it."
1,Shaver quality,"I purchased the Panasonic ES8078 and it was received in good condition. I used the shaver four times and thought it was great. Then I tried cleaning it in what they call Turbo Mode and that was the end of a servicable unit. The shaver would not return to shave mode.You can not shave in turbo mode as it will cut your face as it vibrates in this mode. I have tried to get Panasonic to replace the unit but with no luck.The only service center Panasonic has is in Mcallen TX and they only have reconditioned units. I wanted a new exchange but I received a used unit. They said if I returned the used unit I would get a new one,but what did I get another used shaver. Panasonic assured me it was like new.I agreed to try it and this shaver will only run in Turbo Mode.So this too is a useless shaver."
5,Great Shaver,Was looking at Norelco (pricey) but came across this and purchased it based on the reviews of others. I absolutly love this shaver. I use it in the shower evey day and simply rinse it out under the shower head. It shaves as close as my old Gillett Mach 3 razor. I havn't used the cleaning system yet as rinsing the soap out of it after each use works just as good. You can't go wrong with this shaver. Also holds a charge for nearly 2 weeks!
2,Ouch!,"If you are a person who gets bumps from shaving against the grain but looking for a better cleaner shave, avoid this electric. Contrary to what Panasonic may claim, this razor will actually tear your face apart. My entire face is now irritated from razor burn and it is somewhat painful. Good luck in your search."
3,eeeeyaahhhh....its' OKAY....,Probably not worth what I paid for it. You're going to have to do alot of back and forth work to get a decent shave out of it. Don't try and shave your neck or you're gonna get some razor burn. Actually shaves better dry than wet. I'm on my 3rd blade so far and shaving quality is average to below average. I've owned about 6 electric shavers. Best one I've had yet was a Remington I bought back in the 80's. Only problem is that I can't find the replacement blades and screen for it anymore and when its' running it sounds like I triggered an alarm at a military base.On the positive side it looks futuristic.
5,Great Panasonoc Shaver,"I've had the shaver for about a month now and so far it's a top notch unit. I don't have a real tough beard so I can't say how well it would shave Fred Flintstone, but the average beard guy should be real happy. I just blow out the shavings for quick shaves and twice a week run it thru the clean cycle. This weekly practice for me works well and saves on cleaning solution. Also Lectric Shave preshave works great for me if you need a little extra lube and close shave."
3,works well!,Smooth Shave. Doesnt work AS good as a regular razor as some people state. Does work good for lazy days though.
1,Disappointed.,"I have a very light beard and have always wet shaved or used a Norelco. I got interested in the Braun Pulseonic, but it was kinda pricy. I settled for the Vortex. I am not sure about the logic of a wet electric shaver, so I have not used that feature. As a dry shaver, however, I am very disappointed. It takes forever. I have to shave over a spot over and over again to get a clean shave. And I have an extremely hard time shaving under my chin. I wish I had stuck to Norelco.Second review: Just before I ditched this shaver, I decided to try wet shaving. I had never wet shaved with an electric shaver before. I was pleasently surprised. It gave a smooth, clean, close shave. Not ulike what you get with a regular razor, so I'm still not sure about the logic. But since I've already bought it, I guess I'll keep it. Incidentally, the manual cleaning is much faster, quieter, and effective. I clean it manually, then place it in the charger to dry only."
2,Not a good shaver,"Pros:- Wet/Dry capabilities- Cordless- Cleaning unit works wellCons:- Not for coarse hair- The flip-out beard outliner must first be used, then the actual shaver must be passed over face repeatedly for less than desired result- Does not seem to be powerful enough"
4,Very Good Shaver If You Use It Right...,"I've been using this shaver for about a month and I am fairly happy with it. I've owned 3 Panasonic shavers over the past 10 years and I find them to be the best for tough beards like mine. I've tried Braun, Remington, and Wahl and have never been happy with their performance. This shaver works great if you know how to get the most out of it. I've learned over the years that there are three things that are important to getting a good shave with an electric razor : 1. Keep the shaver clean. This is made very easy with this shaver since it has a combo charging / cleaning base. 2. Wash and dry your face BEFORE shaving. This will make your whiskers stand up and easier to cut. 3. Press LIGHTLY on your face with the shaver on the first pass. If you still have any stubborn whiskers, then press harder until you have a clean shave. If you follow these steps, I'm sure you'll be as happy with this shaver as I am."
2,Marginal at Best,"I purchased this product about a month ago and have been giving it the benefit of the doubt. Understanding that no electric shaver can competewith a blade razor I did adjust my expectations a bit. However there are several disadvantages to this razor.1)The charger/cleaner system is some what of a mess, it takes nearly three hours to clean the razor and the sound it makes doing these routines makes me think there is a buzz saw in the bathroom. Clearly something you cannot do at night.2) The adjustable head feature only has two settings and really does notglide across your face as well as a triple head norelco.3) I had an older Panasonic that I cold stand on end in my medicine cabinet to dry and save space. This razor you cannot stand on end, a minor thing to think of however we all know how small a medicine cabinet is."
1,very dissappointed,"How does it shave? So-so. No better than any cheap electric I have ever owned.I bought this because I lead a life with deadlines and the thought of not having to clean a razor appealled to me. So I bought one with a self-cleaning system.Forget it.I am not convinced the cleaning system has ever worked.I clean it manually, and take my word, a ""back-and-forth"" system is MUCH more difficult to clean manually than a rotary. There are places you just can't reach. There are also places that look like they'd break if I tried to clean them.Don't buy this for the self-cleaning system; it's useless."
2,only last few days,"I only used for few days and it didn't work. The price is cheap; however, the quality is not good in terms of a good brand."
2,Cheaply made. Lame.,"Well, I have used a Panasonic ""Smooth Operator"" razor for years.Thought I might replace it with a brand new (and expensive) Panasonic.When I got my new razor I was really surprised. It's a cheap, lightweight piece of plastic.Also, the shave is nowhere near as good as my old razor.I wish I could get my $$ back.It just sits there, collecting dust.What a step backwards for Panasonic!"
3,"By for cleaning option, nothing else","This unit is just OK. average shaving & comfort. If you want a unit that can be cleaned & is water safe, it's good. Nothing to spectacular about the quality of the shave."
3,An Okay-to-Good Book,"THE GREAT GAME was a great book. Suspenseful, interesting, etc.LIKE HIDDEN FIRE, in comparison, doesn't really come close to comparing to THE GREAT GAME.LIKE HIDDEN FIRE has its moments where you're flipping pages in anticipation of the next page, but in a book with nearly 500 pages, there aren't enough moments like this and the existing moments don't last long enough.Can't quite really put my finger on any specific issue. The overall storytelling sort of wanders from one area or time into another one, and you weren't quite sure what the connection was. Other accounts are told, only to seem as if there was really no other point to include it.Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad book, per se. If you haven't read either book yet, read THE GREAT GAME before this one (aside from the fact that THE GRAT GAME historically precedes LIKE HIDDEN FIRE)."
2,Clumpy,"I have used this product many times before & love it. This time ordered from a different vendor on amazon. It's real clumpy. Looks like maybe it has been sitting for awhile. Usually very smooth. Gave it 2 stars because I tried it anyway & it still works well. I know I wouldn't sell a product that looked like this, let alone buy it."
2,Disappointed,"This book is very interesting, but it's more about the history of the company than the history of their drums.Other disappointment: it does not contain any color picture, just some bad B&W photographs."
3,Verdict still out...,"The product looked a little old and almost grainy to me, but my father the railroad guy said it would be alright. I'll have to wait until he uses it to know for sure. I'd probably look somewhere else for this exact item though, that's just me."
1,An English Ken Kesey....Nah!,"Try as I could to keep reading, this novel moved along as if it was sleepwalking. I am not quite sure what Ms Ingoldby is attempting to say but her characters don't shed much light. While Pat Barker and Patrick McGrath's recent books on asylums were captivating and special, this one misses the mark. A Cookoo's Nest this is not!"
3,snaps are for heavy fabric,"Snaps are for a heavy fabric. Tried it on a thin fabric and just tore it apart when trying to separate the snaps. After a somewhat labor intensive installation, I was disappointed to ruin the clothing."
2,Product not as pictured.,"Mine came with a smooth, un-knurled holder shaft (the part you hold & use to press the top snap part into position. Using my old Tandy snap part, (because the supplied backs were too short!) was a challange indeed. The tool nest (round buck you hammer into) was poorly machined too. Nothing good to report here...Sorry.This is bare minimum, disappointing product. They cut corners on the knurling, the snaps, the nest, and should be ashamed! Hey General, try your own tool out, then tell us how well it works. (I hate having to leave reviews like this one.)"
3,Not that good,"I bought this kit to do some repairs on my boat cover, well they are cheap and did't really work to good, I suppose if you use them on some other type of material they would be fine, the shaft when you try to assemble the snap fastener just kind of compressed instead of spreading out and down thus making the shaft even shorter."
4,Just so you know. . .,"Like all the other Kingfisher ""First"" books, this one is lovely and well suited to elementary-age minds and reading levels. Lots of pictures and nice, large print; lots of cool experiments. As for the controversial section on reproduction, this is exactly how it reads: ""To make a baby, a man puts his penis inside a woman's vagina to release sperm. The sperm swim toward the egg and fertilize it. The fertilized egg grows into a baby inside the uterus."" Frankly, if I could re-write or delete one sentence from this book, I would find nothing else objectionable--but I'm just not sure my six-year-old is ready to wrap his head around this information."
4,The Kingfisher First Human Body Encyclopedia (Kingfisher First Reference),Great Books. Nice learning tool. Each subject matter is short and to the point. Easy for younger children to understand.
3,It's ok,"A little too general for my tastes. If you're just starting out, and have young young kids with short short attention spans, this book may be good for you. For my family, and my little scientists, it just didn't do it. Each section is basically a teeny blurb about the subject. Didn't really catch the kids' attention. They've moved on to other books that do a better job of informing them about their bodies. Oh well."
1,Argh!,"I love Blutengel but this DVD release is embarrassing!! The ""live"" concert includes an excellent set list, but that is about where the positives end! I would have loved to have seen some live keyboards and drums but the music is just pre-recorded and the only live aspect is the vocals, which, unfortunately, are terrible. Both Chris and Constance disappoint, hardly hitting a correct note all concert. They try to add an element of excitement by bringing on some gothic vampire chicks to dance and crawl around suggestively but this fails to cover up the fact that Chris has the onstage presence of a cardboard box."
4,Why still not released on dvd?,"This is one of the movies that should have been released on dvd a long time ago but still has not been done,why that is so i am baffled.This is a great movie,worthy to be on dvd and kept by fans(of which i am sure are numerous) for eternity.Can the powers that be please release it on dvd,and soon!"
2,Treo 650 phone quality,"Phone operation is a big disappointment on Verizon wireless.Reception is poor & the phone runs its battery down looking for a stronger signal. Incoming calls often go straight to voice mail because the base station thinks my phone is turned off.Speed dial often does not go through; I don't know if the numbers dial too fast or too slow.My 5 yr old Nokia was a much better phone.I have co-workers with the same phone on Cingular & they do not have the problems, so it seems to be a combination of the phone & the service provider.I swapped the phone with Verizon but the new phone is no better.Built-in speaker phone is too raspy to be of much use.PDA functions are nice; phone is not."
5,Days of Our Lives is the greatest soap ever!!!!!,I have looked and looked online for Days episodes on DVD. I have not seen a lot of the episodes but I want to very badly. I love the soap and cannot wait until it comes out(and I really hope it will). I know there are a lot of people besides me that want the DVD's to come out.
5,I can't wait!!!,I can't wait for this to start coming out on DVD. It'll be nice to have to watch over and over. I LOVE watching the older episodes that I may not have seen.
4,Frances Reid Alice Horton Fans Want DVDS Of Days Of Our Lives,"Fans of Frances Reid and her character role of Alice Horton want DVDs of Days Of Our Lives with her.She is and was the show.The show began in 1965 and was so good with her.She always gave good acting in every scene she was in.The fans always enjoyed the Horton family Christmas episodes and Alice and the episodes where Alice pretended to be Big Sal looking for info to clear her husband Tom Horton of a crime he didn't do with the private detective Howie.Alice would do comedy and drama and Frances Reid played the role so good that she was like a member of the family to her fans.We all miss Frances Reid and her role of Alice.The show is not the same without her in the show.She was the reason to watch the show.Louise Sorel in the role of Vivian Alamain,Suzanne Rogers in the role of Maggie Horton are good in the show also Doug and Julie and Marie Horton are all liked also.Though it is Frances Reid who we all enjoyed most in the show."
5,Days Forever: Let's Do It!!!,"I have watched days since I was a preschooler (my mom watched the 1/2 hour shows in the 60's) I watched it every summer when I was in school, learned how to use a VCR just to tape Days while I worked, have worked my lunch hour around Days and just generally LOVE it. How could I not? I remember when most of the characters were born! Put it on DVD. We who are die hard, love it, fans will buy it."
5,I can't wait for the release,I would be glad to see the entire serie released. And it's not impossible even it's been 40 years since the first episode started.
5,I would spend any amount for this collection!!!,"I was the biggest fan of Days Of Our Lives back in the 80's and just loved Steve and Kayla. I stopped watching the show when they left, but now I'm a die hard fan once again with their return! I would give anything for their whole story on dvd. It would be like a dream come true!"
3,not that bad,the book was ok. i wish it had basic math in it. when i order the book a cd was suppose to come with but it didnt thats what i really was waiting for. it have a lot of quizes to take its not bad.
4,Booty's Xmas,"This is a totally different kind of Xmas music. It's enjoyable, amusing, and strange (but upbeat). But what do you expect from Bootsy (smile)."
4,not into christmas but hey this is bootsy baby,bootsy goes back into his space bass and bringfs us a hellafunky way to celebrate the holidays boy if he did this in 1978 it would have been retarded but every track on here bumps bootsy redefined the funk album and how the funk should be represented in thgis case rock on bootsy.
5,Awesome,"It took less than a week to get this cd and was in perfect condition. Also this was the most awesome, ghetto Christmas cd ever. I loved it."
3,I bought it for fun,"In the 80's I bought a vinyl featuering ""Bootsy Collins and the Rubber Band"" and that is my full and complete knowledge of this artistThe fact is, I bought it because, hey, how many people do you know that have a Christmas Album from Bootsy Collins?"
1,Christmas music,I was disappointed in the music. Not what I wanted but no fault of yours. I just picked the wrong one
2,"Great Hurricane, But Most Footage Can be Found for Free","You can find all the footage in this documentary very quickly, and for free, on YouTube. It seems like someone just slapped together YouTube clips, but it is sort of nice to have them in one product. The 1938 New England Hurricane was a wicked storm."
3,Content good. Writing... well...,It is a great look into the lives of investigators. I just think it could be written better.
2,Magnetic tape,"This stuff is only good for a horizontal surface as it has very week magnatism, also the tape backing will not stick worth a shit to anything it just wants to roll back up into a roll"
1,waste :(,this product doesn't stick to the wall very well. It started to peel after a few days and we eventually just took it down. it did pull the paint off the wall :(
5,please more seasons of good old Sam,"As many of you I too have seen and still love to watch Sam Mccloud.I already have season 1 and 2 off course, but but but where is the rest??!!??!!I also have Kojak, Columbo, Quincy me, Mission Impossible, and love them all.But I must say that Sam have a speciel place in my heart. I really really want to watch the restof the episodes. I cannot see why they are not on DVD yet.Anyone who know whom to contact???I simply refuse to belive that it is impossible to make them realise that we are a lot that want more Mccloud.:-)"
2,"Fun TV shows, but not good quality discs","Have only watched Disc One (4 shows), but am disappointed that there are skips on both sides, in places the sound breaks up, and at a couple places the disc got stuck and I had to shut the machine down, reload and start at a later spot in the show."
5,Need More McCloud!!,"I'm thrilled to be able to watch McCloud in all of his glory in the first 2 seasons, but I'm desperate to get a hold of the remaining 6 seasons. Were they never released? And if not, why? God give me some answers."
1,Waste Of Dough,Not a good series as I hoped plots were hard to follow thankfully there only three disks !Boring Boring no one could carry this show in acting the series just plain pitiful !!
2,MC CLOUD,tHIS WAS VERY ENJOPYABLE WHEN IT FIRST AIRED ON TELEVISION BUT IS IS DATED AND NOT AS GOOD AS I RECALL FROM 30 YEARS AGO
5,"wow, what a soundtrack?","The lionheart soundtrack is a true classic. This is how soundtracks were meant to be generally constructed and then put together. The composer, John Scott, created a timeless masterpiece here. His composite usage of brass and strings is something that everyone deserves to enjoy. Anyone who has watched the movie more than once will more than likely agree that the music makes it so much more appealing. This is especially true of the lionheart theme. Its one of my favorites, if not the favorite.Also, i would like to add that the track list posted here (amazon) is wrong. The soundtrack has 21 tracks. Also, its the intrada label."
4,audio samples are from a different album!,"John Scott's score to ""Lionheart"" is on the Intrada label and has 21 tracks. The 15 tracks used here as audio samples are from Jerry Goldsmith's score to a different ""Lionheart."" Note that Goldsmith has 3 ""Lionheart"" albums too, a volume 1 and 2 of the soundtrack, plus a symphonic version. The audio samples used here seem to be from the latter. Enjoy the music, but it's not John Scott!"
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ANY HOME,THIS IS A MUST HAVE PRODUCT. I HAVE ONE AND LOVE IT. I BOUGHT THREE FOR GIFTS AND MY DAUGHTER HAS ALREADY TALKED ME OUT OF ONE!! THE LIDS GO ON AND OFF EASILY. BAKES EVENLY AND WASHES WELL. PYREX IS A WELL KNOW NAME THAT YOU CAN TRUST.
5,Great Dish!,"These are great dishes, I bought them while they were on special for the buy 3 get one free. I love these dishes and highly reccomend them to anyone that is looking for dishes that you can bake in and store the left overs right in the same dish. Great buy!!"
2,Wouldnt recommend...,"My bf and I recently went on a two week trip to Morocco and took along this book. I have to say, the maps were horrible, we got lost so many times trying to follow the maps and had to constantly ask locals to guide us. We also discovered that the book didnt mention that you need reservations in pretty much every riad and the majority of hotels you want to stay at. Also, make sure you get the most recent edition... a few places listed were closed and had been for some time.All in all, we were disappointed with this book."
2,itm,"Rather stereotyped cultural comments which are not particularly accurate. Having seen the DK Guide to Morocco since, wish I had bought that instead."
5,Definitive translation,"The translators have captured the poetry of the original, without losing the meaning. This text has all the beauty and power of the Matics translation, but encompasses the logic and clarity of Bachelor's. The text itself is the sublime essence of the Dharma and simply by reading it carefully one can be transformed and transported to higher states of consciousness. The translators provide a host of helpful and informative notes to the text. These are essential to the modern reader because they elucidate the context within which the 8th century text was delivered - which was in the thriving Buddhist milieu of the great monastic university of Nalanda at it's height. One of the most important books ever written in the east or west."
1,A truly bad translation,"I'm at a loss to understand why anyone would recommend this translation of the Bodhicharyavatara, versus any of the other choices available on the market. It completely lacks the poetic quality of the Padmakara translation, and the straightforwardness of the Batchelor translation. I don't even understand why academics would want it--the notes are self-obvious.The most readable translation I've come across is the Padmakara translation, published by Shambhala, and it includes a good introduction and substantial notes."
4,Spectacular on SACD,"When I first heard the CD, I didn't really like the album except for a couple of songs. Then I got the SACD just for fun, and boy what a difference. From the first 5 seconds of the first track, I could tell the SACD has space around all the instruments and synthesized effects, and this clarity is consistent with the rest of the album. It was quite revelatory. I think this is quite an enjoyable album, and the songs, like most of Bowie's songs, evoke a mood or atmosphere. If you like Bowie at all, avoid the CD and go straight to the SACD."
5,Did you like the regular CD-release?,"Than you will absolutely LOVE this SACD recording. Hear Mr. Bowie sing almost a capella out of the center of your surround system, all instruments clear and brilliant from the rest of the speakers. Even if you know or own the CD release you need this one, it's definetly a new dimension of enjoying music.Buy it! Marsch Marsch! ;-)"
2,Shaves almost as good as my $45 Norelco...,"and only costs 10x as much. But you get a nice toy car. Norelco batteries are not easily replacable, so when this goes, you will want to fix it rather than just pitch it and get a new one, which will cost you nearly as much as buying a new less expensive Norelco.And the deluded that think this could be a collector's edition? Maybe if you don't use it, but I don't care how rare it is, if you shaved with it you can keep it. Well, unless you are some celebrity that can sell it on EBAY that is.Great Razor. Nice Case. Cute toy car. Worth about $150 tops."
5,A must-have resource,I have used a previous edition for over 10 years and have found it incredibly valuable. I can usually figure out a medical problem in advance of the doctor's visit. Glad to have a newer edition now!
3,Complete Guide to Symptoms,This is a good book. It will help answer you questions about your health.
2,Buy something else,"This was a waste of money...bought it 2 years ago, played with it once, was so disappointed I'd spent that much on a dud. It doesn't fly well at all since it's constructed of such floppy materials, so there didn't seem to be much point to it after that. People get rather frustrated when throwing a giant frisbee back and forth and it never goes in the direction/to the person you threw it to. I will probably allow the dog to have her way with it and throw away the pieces - I'd hate to Goodwill it and have someone else spend money on it."
1,Worthless and misleading book,"I had Mini long-haired Dachshunds all my life and my new little puppy is even more stubborn than the others!! I bought this book to help me braking her bad bathroom habits which comes from her very dominant personality otherwise she's just so sweet and affectionate.I agree with the other reviews, this book was written for dogs in general NOT for the very particular personality traits of the Dachshund!! I assume that the author never owned a Doxie and probably only encountered a few, that is why she assume they are not cuddly as Doxies can be reserved with new people but give them a few encounters and they will be all over you.All my Doxies are EXTREMELY affectionate like no other dogs really. I'm writing this with two on my lap right now! I can't even go to the bathroom on my own without the Doxies wanting to be with me at any cost!! They are little bundle of love.If you want more info on Dachshunds you should get Dachshunds for Dummies by: Eve Adamson instead."
2,A Canned Training Perspective,"Interesting in a general aspect of training however this book did not answer any of our specific questions about training Dachshunds. I imagine this book starting as a template where the ""author"" inserted the topical breed's name here and there, then, threw in a few photos of that breed and voila--you've got a breed specific training manual."
1,Don't buy this book,"I read through this book at a Half Price Book Store. It was fast reading and not informative enough on training dachshunds. Also, my dachshund is definitely a lap dog and a cuddler. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Bad Book,"I agree with others. This Author must never have owned a doxie. Mine never lets me out of his site. He curls up in my lap all the time, sleeps with me, cries and howls if he can't find me. Had no trouble house training him once I put in a pet door except when it's really cold or raining he wants me to go out with him. He is stubborn, very protective and chews but at 10 mos. he's still learning and so am I. He is the best companion I've had since my childhood pet. I just hope I go before he does. Onyx has really helped with the loss of my oldest son (age 19) I have another teenager but Onyx has been like having a new baby. This Author was way off base. Doxies are Wonderful!"
4,Good buy,"Very informative. It helps you understand the breed a lot better. However, I felt that some of her training techniques were unrealistic in the common household."
1,Barron's guide is no good,Barron's guide for State trooper and Highway Patrol exams is way off base. I just got done taking my California Highway Patrol test and found out that I just wasted my time using the Barron's guide. There was literally probably only 5% of the material off of Barron's guide actually on the test. Do not buy this!!!!!!!!!!!
5,We need the DVDs!! :),I was just saying that I wish I could go back and watch this from the beginning. I know it would take a long time to watch them all but I'd love to have the DVDs of all seasons anyway. lol I know...I guess I am nuts!
5,Y&R,I LOVE Y&R If anything They shiould at least Bring The Best of the weddings and THE Best of colleen She rocks AND victoria is cool Both HEather and The other girl.
5,It is Sooooo Time,I've been waiting so long for a full set of DVD's to come out for Y&R. From the Beginning Please! I was a teenager and watched from the beginning. I still watch every day.
5,Great resource for people retiring,bought the book to figure out how to take care of my parents. great resource.
5,"Great camera, all the features you need and easy to use","After looking at camera reviews for over 2 months I finally settled on this one. This is my first camera and I must say that I'm really happy with my choice. It seems it's hard to find a camera with all the features you want but this one had the most features. What was important to me was a rechargeble lithium battery with good life and Sony is the only one I know of with the info lithium technology, included AC charger, MPEG movie capable, optical zoom, ease of use, customizable functions, USB connectivity, and of course picture quality. With other cameras it seemed like you had to buy rechargeable batteries, a charger or they don't have USB support which is a must these days. My only complaint is that it only comes with a 4mb memory stick which is not very useful but I bought a 16mb stick with it that turns out to be free with a $50 mail in rebate. This is a great camera and I highly recommend it."
1,old and worthless,"completely worthless,300 bucks for something that doesnt apply, we're working ver5r2 now days...."
3,Does not match description,"Please note that the item contains 24 grommets, as indicated on the manufacturer's website. The description incorrectly says it contains 48 grommets (as of 7/29/10). Otherwise as described."
1,wrong size,"I ordered the grommets and received the wrong size - I needed them for handle holders in tote bags that I make-I ordered 1.3/8 "" but only received 3/8"""
2,Plantronics Headphones,This product is VERY dissapointing. While the headphones fit great compared to others I have owned the sound quality is lacking. You can barely hear the person talking on the other end and forget about listening to music. Save your money...
3,Hmm..a little confusing..,"How can a pair of stereo headphones be ""confusing"", you ask?Because, if you insert the jack in all the way, you only get one earful of sound.Huh? What's wrong with this thing?Ah, I see: you have to pull it out, just a teeny bit, you get BOTH channels ; and it's funny - the sound is out of phase giving you stereo but with a ""surround"" effect, just a little.Hmmm. My Sonys' don't do that.Hmmm."
1,Perfect fit but doesn't work!,I bought these because I can't use the inside ear headphones due to small ears. I bought it with an adapter because I have an iPhone. I was very excited to use them but they don't work consistently. The person says they can barely hear me and I have to play around with the cord to even get it to work. Very disappointing. Going to try something else!
1,Didn't work,"Headphone set did not work at all, I tried it in several electronic devices. Even bought an adaptor for it to see if it would work in my cd player."
2,average,this product not as shown. is actually in ear phones model number 213. i found these (model number 123) at best bye and actually prefferred the ones i got here. nothing to rave about but does what they should.
1,Headphones,Do not buy these. I thought they were headphones and they aren't. I used them on xbox live and it is hard to hear on these and they are so uncomfortable on your ears. Don't waste your money these.
3,Book Review,"I got a used copy so there was a bit of scribbling in it, but it was in decent condition and still legible. The recipes were simple and the author's sense of humor came through. All in all a good purchase."
1,this is bullcrap,I thought this was the name of a really cool band I was searching for but instead it was this stupid movie. I hope you all watch this movie and decide it sucks thank you in advanceyour pal greg
5,Excellent for High Schoolers taking the AP Exam,"As an eleventh grader in high school this book has helped me develop my writing for both the AP Language and Composition Exam and for the essay portion of the SAT exam. It is captivating,concise, and most important: easy to read."
5,Excellent book for teachers,"Great book, a classic but still thoughtful and wise about thinking and writing and teaching, read it to inspire and consider."
4,They say i Say,"This book is good for teaching average writers certain formats for their writings, while providing a starting place to begin their works. I would recommend this book."
1,Any decent writer will probably hate this book,"I'm sure if you can't write at a college level and you'd like to, this can be a very informative book. For the rest of us, please pass on it. My teacher has forced us to read this drivel and write in this format.They (my teacher) say that formulaic writing can help your imagination soar and really help your writing ability. I say its a crock of **** and don't want to waste my time with such idiotic books and would prefer to write papers in my own style.To those who have to buy it for a college class, I wish you luck in selling it to the next poor sucker who has to buy it."
4,Review,The book was as we were told. The delivery was later by about a week than we were at first anticipating. We got it is all that really matters.
2,Sucks,This book sucks.I had to get it for my English class.I don't even know why my English teacher likes it because she doesn't agree with some of the stuff in it.
5,Food for illiterate people's thoughts,The book was in excellent condition and arrived very quickly and I am extrememly pleased with the services provided.
5,a useful and very funny book,I have read this book at least three times. His advice makes sense and the book is illustrated with funny stories from the author's experiences. Some stories make me laugh again each time I read them.
4,Simply put,"I like all of Biddulph's books because of the way they are written. They are clear, to the point with great examples. They are easy to read and let's face it, if you are a parent, there will be limited time to read, especially in the early years! So this book does it in a fashion that makes it easy to refer to time and again. Very positively written that celebrates children and the gift that they are to each and every one of us.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
3,knowledge that is hidden from us.,"This was very helpful to me.I like mysticism.Certain parts of the book are repetitive.The author tends to be a bit harsh with humanity,people grow and develop spiritually at their own pace.He also insists that his way is the only way.But good information.You have to be interested in mysticism and spirituality to appreciate this book.If the information in this book is true then I can understand why it was hidden."
2,Simply Not Good!,"I was told about this book from watching a documentary entitled Sex: The Secret Gate to Eden. The documentary is clearly more worthwhile than this book. This book is written by a strange and mentally unstable man. The ideas, more specifically Gnosticism, do fascinate me and are even believeable. But just a quick read through this book, or any of the author's others for that matter, will have you putting it down quickly. Skip it and watch the documentary as mentioned above. If you're still not convinced look this guy up on Wikepedia."
3,From other point,"There is one main idea in this book and everything is done to sustain it. However a man accepts it or not, evidentiary objectivity makes him to impeach. This book could be a draft from which you begin to make book ready for publishing, or a treatment from which you make a script.Review viewers and potential readers, you should know what people who prints all Samael Aun Weor books encouraged followers to make every man familiar with SAW writings and to write good reviews to atract people."
5,sexual energy and spirituality,"This is a terrific book that teaches that liberation from suffering can be achieved by conservation and transmutation of sexual energy and psychological work dissolving the ego, the 'I'. Here, the spiritual power of romantic love is harnessed in sexual union by refraining from the orgasm and awakening the heart through mutual adoration and tenderness. This is a recommended read for anyone who wonders about the relationship between sex and spirituality. Many other topics are covered, including clairvoyance, reincarnation, and the kundalini.""When man and woman unite sexually in the Perfect Matrimony, they are truly ineffable Gods in those voluptuous moments."""
5,Incredible,"Samael Aun Weor clearly outlines the keys and steps neccessary to enter into real, practical Initiation within the internal worlds. This is not merely another spiritual movement, this is a spiritual revolution. This book is for anyone brave enough to face the reality of our both our internal and external worlds. Samael gives the precise clue to free ones soul from suffering and enter in Initiaton: sexual tantra.As with any book from the Master, you can read it 50 times and still find new information."
2,Followers are not very Light,"While this book may contain a few tidbits of wisdom, I have to notice that some of the positive reviewers (like P.valois) who give 5 stars to everything that Weor writes, also seem to give 1 star reviews and disparaging comments to anything written on the same subject by anyone else that they can find on Amazon. I see these name over and over. This seems to me dishonest and not a path followed by people truly looking for Light, but those who which to lead others to a particular path. I would suggest looking for a variety of books on Tantra other than this one for an honest comparison. Tyson, Fortune, Frater U:.D:., and (perhaps) Crowley are several that come to mind with contrasting viewpoints to Weor."
1,Defective,"It was defective. All the other DVD's worked fine. On this one the screen said ""Region Error"" and wouldn't play. I returned it and asked them to send a replacement because I really wanted this movie, but they just issued me a credit."
5,"An ""Actor's"" Movie!","To borrow a line from LFR, ""This is turning into a movie about a play!"". Richard The 3rd comes alive, like I've never before experienced it! As an actor and drama teacher, I've found this video to be as entertaining, as it is instructive! It's opened up a whole new world to my students...and helped them to become aquainted with, and develop a love for Shakespeare. This is one you don't want to miss!"
1,Looking For Richard (European edition),"The movie version of Looking for Richard was a European edition and would not play on my DVD player. You should know this, and I would like my money back!Greg Job"
1,Looking for Richard and Calamity Jane,"Two movies I purchased, neither one will play on the DVD player. They are worthless. Apparently, they were of the wrong format. I can no longer afford to purchase DVD's from Amazon."
5,First class soundtrack!,This is wonderful filmmusic for the best Wyatt Earp movie.Nr 4 is one of the most beautiful tracks I ever heard from a soundtrack.Nr 18 is not far behind. Buy it and you will agree that it's a good investment.
3,Tad Better than Bland,"It was all right... just all right. Some of the ideas stated were interesting and even prophetic, like the harnessing of wind power for electricity. Some parts reminded me of Fahrenheit 451.The greatest disappointment was the ending. I was expecting Wells to use the story's build-up to say something clever and meaningful regarding the state of humanity, along with perhaps some useful suggestions, even if unfeasible. But it just ended in an unsatisfying way, almost as if he suddenly got tired of it and wanted to work on something else.This is not a good ""Wells starter book"" -- The Time Machine is far better -- but as a study in fiction styles it is all right."
2,Not the best of Wells's work...,"In 1897 a gentlemen falls asleep to wake up in 2100. In the future he finds himself owner of much of the world as his money, which grew while he slept, was used to take over the world by buying up all businesses and property. Now the ""Sleeper"" finds himself in the middle of a power struggle between those who have and those who have not.The characters are bland, the future feels like a false front, like one of those towns used in a Wild West movie, and even after pages and pages of details everything still seems vague. I can't picture much of what he writes about as he seems to skim over scenes, leaving out details, and shooting ahead to what parts of the story he believes are important.His idea about cities of the future, while interesting, is not interesting enough to carry a whole plot."
5,Great moisturizer - Dermalogica Active Moist,"Great moisturizer - Dermalogica Active Moist: used for day and night; light, not greasy. A little high on the price point but a little moisturizer goes a very long way. Was delivered promptly and in good condition. Was satisifed. Will definitely order again."
2,Not for me!,"I'm reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I'm a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn't sensitive or acne prone. I take very good care of my facial skin.This is not for me. Based of the Esthetician's review, I bought this as a summer moisturizer. I found it made my face too shiny/oily. I held onto it through winter and it worked ok except by the end of the day, my skin looked shiny/oily. I know it's oil free but I do NOT like this and wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have extremely dry skin."
3,Not sure if this is the real stuff,"The first time I bought this product I bought it at an Ulta store. I fell in love immediately. I have oily skin, so I have to be very careful to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin even more oily/shiny. This was definitely it. However, the one I purchased here on Amazon had a different texture and consistency, it was very runny and not as thick as the one I bought from Ulta. It still seemed to work about as well, but it made it harder to get the right amount squeezed out."
5,Best moisturiser ever!,"I had stopped using Dermalogica products because I moved and I thought I could not get them any longer. My skin was in horrible condition,so I searched around and found I could get them again. Now that I am it is already looking so much better.My pores are tightening up again, it is not excessively oily anymore and does not look red and damaged like it does when I use the other products on the market. I will never go without Dermalogica products again!I am now using their Dermal Clay Cleanser,Oil control lotion when I have problems with excess oil, and Active Moist for everyday use."
4,Great All Year Moisturizer,I first experienced this moisturizer at a day spa and loved how my skin felt. I started purchasing a lot of things within the line to try out but when it comes to the moisturizers I stay consistent with the active moist. It is hydrating but it doesn't leave your face feeling (or looking) oily. It's great for all skin types (mine is combination but varies based on the season) and it doesn't have a weird smell like some other products do.
5,Light weight non-greasy moisturizer.,This has been my favorite product from dermalogica so far. I have used various products from this line for over a year and have been very pleased with everything. Active moist is exactly what my face needs to blend my oily T-line. It is light weight so it does not create excess oil and moisturizes so I do not get dry spots. It is great in the morning before I apply a little powder and blush. I no longer wear foundation thanks to the chrome white product line. This product has worked out very well.
4,I love Dermalogica,"I started using Dermalogica a year ago and am very satisfied with the results. The active moist cream is fantastic, especially during the cold, winter months. I haven't had any allergic reactions or irritations. I highly recommend it to anybody who is sensitive to other products."
3,Great Product but Very Expensive,This is a great product but over priced. I didn't realize this product was only 1.7oz. Its VERY expensive. I've seen in store spa sales with the full size for a similar price.
2,Hmm.. not for me...,"Well i bought this with high hopes, but.. first time use my acne got really red and started to irritate. But i thought its because i used it for the first time but it made it more red as the day pasts. well i didnt liked the smell and it felt wired cuz its too light. It doesn't moisturize well..not for people who have mild/severe'ish acne.changed my moisturizer...."
2,Too expensive,Too expensive for what it is. What else do you want me to say? It burns? It costs too much.
2,Very Weak Magnet,"I bought the magnetic strip as a means to keep my garbage drawer closed. It is a long story, but a simple drawer return would not work. My thought was to tap a steel washer (has to be steel - not stainless steel or aluminum) to one side of the drawer and then use the magentic strip on the other. Unfortunately, the strip is not magnetic enough to work.I will say that the adhesive used for the backing works well. However, the magnet barely exerted enough force to keep the steel washer from falling off.Final Verdict - May work well for very minor tasks (hanging prints on your fridge - although it will not hold a frame), but if you need anything more than that you may find yourseld disappointed.2 Stars"
3,Not in English (Subtitles),Could be my fault but I didn't notice that this movie was not in english. It was Italian with english subtitles. I would think that that would be prominently posted. Great movie though.
2,Extremely Frustrating,"I found Enchantment to be a 288 paged whine. It is a story of a girl named Hannah. I was given this story to read for a ""coming of age"" theme. This character NEVER meets this requirement, she is stuck in immaturity and I was unable to feel empathy or anything for Hannah. There was no order or plot and nothing ever seemed to happen. It was well written considering that the story had nothing. But witty did not save the book. I thought it was dreadful."
5,Jonah Black has done it again!!,Jonah Black is a total babe! He has done it again. I am truely a Black fan.This book is better than the first one. Jonah is a sex god and my hero! I've got all his books!I hope that you will buy them! I really cant tell you a summary on the book because i wont be able to stop. Trust me this book is worth 5 stars!
5,Great help for Caregivers,"This book compiles a variety of articles and poems, helpful practical hints and thoughtful commentary on the difficult task of caring for a loved one. As the owner of an internet list for caregivers of Parkinsonians, I have recommended it to others, and have received feedback from them, which indicates they found it ""worth every cent"" of the cost. The format is very readable, with short pieces suited to the busy lives of caregivers."
1,The Groove is Gone....,"I absolutely loved Ben Sidran's ""The Doctor Is In"" and ""The Go Jazz All-Stars"". I have listened to ""Feel Your Groove"" at least a dozen times and still can't get myself to like it. It's one thing that the CD's music is really dated, but I would have to guess that even back in it's day of recording this was a bust. Sound like some high schooler's made up the words and the music is not any better. You'll now find ""Feel Your Groove"" in the trash. Sorry, because I really like many other of Sidran's work."
2,Good Basic Information but not enough for type 1's,This books title is very promising but it doesn't follow through. It contains good basic information but almost nothing on the potential risks of high blood sugar during pregnancy. There is also no information on reasons that your doctor might want to deliver early or other special needs that a woman with type 1 diabetes might want to consider when planning her delivery.
2,"""What to expect"" leaves you still expecting!","Although the title promised a great deal of information, I was very disappointed. Most of the chapters do not go indepth enough to really inform and comfort. It is missing a great deal of information that a well versed insulin dependent diabetic woman would want and expect to know/learn. For example, it doesn't mention the use of insuln pump therapy, the use of Humulog insulin nor the rotation of injection sites in pregnancy...it just didn't do it for me. This book is the type you woud find on a Dr. office waiting room table..just to browse through, not used for heavy duty info. Overall, it would be excellent for an expecting woman to use this book to aid her in questioning her Doctors further...not as an indepth source alone."
5,Plumbing systems,Probably one of the best handbooks on HVAC pumps. Arrived quickly and in good condition. The book is hardcover. Paper quality is not the best but acceptable.
3,"They work, but don't see much use","These are accessory probes for Fluke's modular probe system. The main reason to get them over the standard probes is that they fit snugly in standard banana plug jacks, which makes them handy for probing instrument outputs. But, your usual banana plug patch cords can accomplish the same thing... Also, these probes have removable insulating shields which must be removed if they are to be inserted into a banana jack (see picture) and these are easy to lose. Finally, standard Fluke alligator clip extenders won't fit on these probes, so they have to be swapped out for the standard probes to use them. In all, a pretty specialized product which gets used very little if at all."
5,"Nora Roberts, The Reef","Great story about a family and friends who dive for treasure, long forgotten.There is a lot of suspense, murder, and of course, romance.Really enjoyed the reading."
4,The Reef,"What a great book! After all the NR books I have read, I am still amazed by her descriptive abilities only this location is unlike any other. This story has many locations under water. Diving is a huge element, and I felt like I was there.The characters were well written - Tate Beaumont and Matthew Lassiter had chemistry, friendship, and love. The families were important to the story also. Angelique's Curse was very intriguing. There was a lot of history, mystery, and the curse attached."
4,Fun and Exciting,"Despite the cheesiness found in most Nora Roberts books, this one is fun, exciting, and romantic. I love the two main characters."
1,Disappointing,"I buy all of Nora Roberts books since I first read, ""Honest Illusions"", which I loved. I thought, ""The Reef"", was so bad I gave up after about 60 pages. The book was boring."
2,Highly disappointing,"This was the first of Nora's books that I felt like giving up after about 50 pages. I had just read the much superior River's End before starting The Reef, and the latter turned out to be a big let down. There was not much humor in the interaction between the characters, and they just failed to grab my attention and interest. The dialogue between the two main characters sounded actually fake, and at times made me cringe. Their true emotions never came to the surface. Nonetheless some interesting plot twists in the end rose above the level, and it turned out to be mildly entertaining."
1,One of the WORST books I have EVER read!,"How this book and Nora Roberts made it to the best-seller list is beyond comprehension. I have never read anything so cliche-ridden, superficial, predictable and jaw-dropping inane. It's clear that Ms. Roberts knows nothing of deep-sea diving nor salvage operations despite the vacation she obviously took to the Carribean (and no doubt deducted on her income taxes) to ""research"" this sorry excuse for a novel. As a man, I was ashamed by the treatment afforded ""Tate,"" Ms. Roberts female protagonist. The character seemed to love getting grabbed, slapped and generally knocked around not only by the bad guy, but by her own boyfriend! Shame on you, Ms. Roberts."
4,You can always count on Nora Roberts,"What more is there to say? If her name's on it, I'll love it. Talk about a guarantee..."
2,Disappointing.,"I have read some of her other fiction and found her writing to be funny, interesting, and sometimes informative. This book lacked all of the above. Also the characterization was sadly lacking. Since I am not a romance fiction fan to begin with, I doubt that I will bother with any of her future books. Perhaps she's writing too many books and needs to concentrate on quality instead of quanity. She's lost this reader."
1,Ignorant book,"This book is about ruthless treasurer hunters, not marine archaeologists as she states. No archaeologist would look for artifacts to sell unless they were highly unethical. Ms. Roberts should have talked to real archaeologists rather than people who rape and pillage the past. Plus, the wreckage was the property of the St. Kitts-Nevis government. Her heroine broke the law by removing the artifacts.Also, her discussion of St. Kitts shows her ignorance of the island. Most of the discussion regarding the relative location of various places is flawed. She should really have looked at a map more closely. AS for the hospital, she should have visited the Basseterre hospital before she wrote about it."
2,A Struggle to Finish,"This book had great potential, but sputtered out midway. Finishing it was a chore. My advice is to pass this one up."
2,Boring,"I generally enjoy NR books, but this one isn't one of them. I couldn't connect with the characters or the story; there was way too much description of diving and searching for artifacts; the characters were dull along with the dialog between them. I did read the entire book, but it was a chore."
4,Nice read but not Roberts's best,"I truly enjoyed this book however the characters are predictable and unimaginative. The villan VanDyke is very much similar to the villian in Hidden Riches. However I do think it's an entertaining read but I really strongly recommand Honest Illustions, it is truly the best book I've ever read. Everyone that's read the book has agreed with me."
2,A comfortable read.,"As one of a legion of Nora Roberts fans, I eagerly await each new title. The characters are old friends and their trials and tribulations a welcome read. "" The Reef "" struck a very strong chord of remembrance. If you read and enjoyed ""Honest Illusions, "" you will also enjoy ""The Reef."" Each book had past and present divisions, angst driven males giving up all for love ( not trusting the 'young' female lead ), characters meeting after time passes, and love rediscovered strong enough to overcome obstacles the second time around. I have come to anticipate characteristics of other novels woven into each new title. It is fun to match lead characters from book to book. Even though I enjoyed this novel, I hope the next one develops beyond the expected."
1,Stop! Before you buy this book.....,"This is NOT the best thing Nora Roberts has ever written. For some unexplaned reason IT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE!!!! About halfway through the book I found myself woundering why I had bought it in the first place. If you're really wanting to kill some time on bad storyline. This is it.Treasure hunting in the ocean while some guy with more money than he knows what to do with tries to steal the site your digging in, to take all the credit and the glory is just plain stupid. It's like a bad made for TV movie that you watch while your snowed in with no place to go. The main character is just so blah that's it's not until the last chapter that the book goes anywhere. My advice, Check the book out of the library and save your money!!!!"
2,No cavemen please...,"Usually love NR's books. This one -- not so much. Liked the descriptions of diving and treasure hunting. But when the men start acting like cavemen -- i.e. slinging the ""little woman"" over their shoulders and carrying her off because it's good for her and winning races because they are superior it just kills it for me. I just couldn't get past it. So what if he ""loves"" her and just has to make her see it. Strong-arm tactics just turn me off. Leave me cold.I couldn't go on. I couldn't finish it."
4,Loved it!,"I loved the adventure in this book. Diving for treasure is exciting enough, but then Tate is paired up with Matthew and the tension begins to heat up. Roberts' characters are real and enjoyable, I loved Tate and Matthew, and adored Tate's parents. Matthew's uncle was a quite a character as well. This is a great read - one of my favorites by Nora Roberts."
3,Technicolor adventure,"This could easily be called ""Aloma of the South Seas"" or some other title befitting an Errol Flynn adventure movie, full of exotic locations, a headstrong, beautiful heroine...a marine scientist of course, a tall, handsome, rough-diamond hero and an evil baddie. Divers are searching for a fabulous ruby, diamond and gold necklace which, according to legend, brings bad luck to whoever owns it. Our hero's father was murdered for his knowledge of the whereabouts of the necklace, and his son is determined to kill his father's killer. The settings in this book are romantic and beautiful, the sex scenes sizzle, so perhaps this makes it an ideal holiday read without having to concentrate too hard."
3,Seemed like a formula book...,I never felt the draw/chemistry between the two main characters. They were the weak part of the book for me. I liked the past/present/future divisions in the book. The minor characters were more interesting than the main characters.
2,Terribly disappointed,"I'm a Nora Roberts fan and have been waiting eagerly for The Reef to be published. I read and re-read her books all the time. However, I must say that I was terribly disappointed with this piece of work. I could barely get through the 2nd chapter. What I love about Nora Roberts's books is the witty conversations between the characters as well as the in-depth build-up of the characters which makes you identify with them. All these were lacking in The Reef. The Templeton series was, in my view, her best. The Macgregor series was pretty good too. I really hope that the next book would be a good read."
4,"Not the most memorable, but a good read.","I found this book to be a fast read. The romance was wonderful (which is typical of Nora Roberts books). The story line is interesting. However, I think that this book, while good, is not her most memorable. Many times after reading a Nora Roberts book, I will wonder how it would have ended if I had been the main character, or what I would have done differently. I didn't do that with this book. I did enjoy it though."
1,Hokey.,"This book was cheese, pure cheese. There was nothing in it that made me think, or made me want to keep reading except for the fact that I wanted to see how they were going to beat they bad guy (you knew it was going to happen, it's one of those books). As said before, it was a cookie cutter book. None of the characters seemed identifiable, and the plot was just a variation to the classic. Boo on this book."
3,Grommet Kit,"The tools seem higher quality than most kits, but the grommets do not seem to be any heavier duty than other kits. They seem ok, not great. My biggest complaint is the description indicated twice as many gommets included, as actually came with the kit. It only came with 12."
4,excellent to have on hand,"I've used this kit for many years. It's not that hard to use IF you have a good set of tools (large hammer/heavy work table). it's just one of those things handy ""men"" ought to have around! Only downside I can see is that I haven't found a source for grommet refills yet."
3,OK for the Money,"Could be of better quality materials. First off, throw away the provided tiny block of wood. It will break on the first hit. Second, go ahead and go to a local style hardware store and purchase a punch, because the one provided is small, weak, and will not last very long. Save yourselves the trouble and expense and just go to your ""local"" privately owned hardware store and buy it there."
1,CDR!!!!,"I received the cd and it was not a Silver CD, it was on CDR. I was completely disappointed. The sound quality is terrible, and I have a .flac version of the album which is SUPERIOR compared to what I received from this purchase. As happy as I am with my other Amazon purchases, this particular purchase was a BIG FAIL!!!!! The seller should have noted that the CD was a CDR."
3,Buy the cd,"The 2 best tracks on this album are Lonely, and of course Dazed And Confused. To beat the fact to death, Holmes was seriously ripped off by Led Zeppelin. The songs are stupid and maudlin at times(Genuine Imitation Life). I have been listening to it on Rhapsody. I have read that the recording quality of this album is poor, especially the vocals. It may have been intentional. Anyway, do not download the [...] version of this because 2 of the tracks skip, the quality is truly horrible and the 2 bonus tracks are throwaways. Maybe the Amazon download is better but I couldn't tell for sure from the 30 second samples. Even though I had reservations because of overall song(not sonic) quality, I just ordered this on cd. I'm sure it will be impossible to find at a reasonable price on cd soon. If you want it I think this is the way to go and the time to buy it."
3,relaxing music/not long enough,I did not realize there are some of the same songs on this CD as others we have from same group and it was not long enough.
5,!!Best Album By Enigma Recommended For Anyone!!,"I had never heard any enigma songs before but the first song i listened of enigma was ""I Love You.. Ill Kill You"" and trust me this song is one you can play in any type of mood. It was so good i had put my speakers to the MAX and i wished it could go louder. And the Other song which i liked was ""T.N.T for the Brain"". I would recommend this to anybody. I really dont think you have to be an Enigma fan to enjoy this album.Peace Out From Fazz ("",)"
5,VERY POWERFUL STUFF !,"Every single song is a beauty, but I particularly like ""turn around"", ""gravity of love"", ""silence must be heard"", and ""smell of desire"". They did some digital fine tuning to all the songs to make them sound even better. Germany and Italy usually produce the best music in the world.......so RUN to buy this cd, pop it in your player and hit PLAY and let this...take you to another world !!!"
4,Very Good,"LSD is a very good compilation comprising the best of the past Enigma CD's and adding a brand new track to lead off. Enigma has been a favorite of mine since I first heard MCMXC a.D. in 1990. I still consider the first and 3rd CD the best however the new single is pretty good. This compilation will please new listeners of Enigma and satisfy current fans. Also other great and similar to style of Enigma CD's are by artists: Delerium, Digital Moodz and Amethystium."
5,another good catch!!!,"THE CD WAS IN GREAT CONDITIONS AND I GOT IT RIGHT ON SCHEDULE,ALSO GREAT PRICE,GOOD DEAL."
5,AMAZING,This is landmark for Enigma. What a beautiful compilation this is. All Enigma fans and new people to Enigma have to buy this CD. All music on it is absolutly magnificent.
2,Buy the original CDs,I am a big Enigma fan and love listening to their music.Didn't care for the feel of this CD. The ambiance created by listening straight through an Enigma CD was lost in this collection.
3,A gift to someone else.,This was a gift during the holiday season to a young man. He said he enjoys it. He collects their work.
1,glorified garbage,"how can anyone listen to this garbage.this is pure slop.enigma are still the worst of ever,next to enya of course.you want boring sound that makes no sense,the get this.you want good music,buy yourself a nice death metal cd."
5,Excellent compilation,"This CD of 18 Enigma singles is a truly great and haunting album.My favorite album of theirs is arguably their first album with it's dark and haunting Gothic sound to it. ""Sadeness"" finds it's way on this haunting collection and merges so well into the intense ""Silence Must Be Heard"".The new songs on this album while not bad by any means, are relatively forgettable and among ENigma's least interesting songs.Some of the songs on here are altered from their original sounds. ""TNT for the Brain"" on here is much darker and far superior to the original.This album is a must-have, even if you already have their original albums."
3,"Where are ""Eyes of Truth"" and ""Mea Culpa Part II"" ?","Where are the singles: ""Eyes of Truth"" (from ""The Matrix""), ""Rivers of Belief"", and ""Mea Culpa Part II"" ? Oh wait I forgot, we still need to buy the original albums, right ?This, even though ""Mea Culpa Part II"", the classic follow-up single to ""Sadeness Part I"" in 1991, isn't even available in its single version aside from the (out-of-print) 1991 CD single. This would have been a nice opportunity for a re-releaseBut leaving out ""Eyes of Truth"" is inexcusable altogether"
5,LSD For The Brain !,"Cretu and company never cease to amaze ! Unstifled by trends, unresricted by gimmicks, Enigma like composer New Age guru Vangelis are in charge of their own musical artistry;There are no compromises. Enigma dares to go where other artists fear to tread. So what if they use samples or loops or too many synthesizers; At least Cretu knows how to use them and not abuse them. Wife Sandra is still in top form with her sensual beckoning voice of passion (or lust ?). This collection has much more to offer other than just atmospheric music. The rich sonic overlapping textures and deep percussion beats on some tracks make for a healthy mental trip that transcends all time and space. The musical or transitional segues that link all songs like one musical suite or landscape can only be described as true Enigma style..."
4,Put the CD player on repeat and let go,"Great CD to put on repeat, the end ties up nicely with the beginning and the middle moves from theme to them without any gaps. I really bought this CD because I wanted a copy of ""Return to Innocence,"" which brings back memories of the last Olympics and is a good song for starting the day. The only drawback of this is that it reminds me of the lawsuit that was going on in '98 filed by the eldery aboriginal Taiwanese couple whose voices appear on the track but were not acknowledged in the original Cross of Changes release. (I'm Taiwanese, by the way.) By the way, I think track #14, ""Push the Limits,"" is about the coolest thing I've ever heard, especially near the 3:00 mark. I like track #15, ""Invisible,"" a lot too, though the female voice on this reminds me a little of the ""Survivor"" theme song."
2,WHACK- Buy at your peril.,"If like me you only have the 'Le roi est mort, vive le roi!' album and you like what you heard- don't buy this and expect similar tracks.With the exception of the amazing track 11 and the okay track 3, the only other good tracks come from the 'Le roi est mort' album. On the other hand if you like their other album's then this might be to your liking. Personally i think its a waste of money.Lucky, i was going to spend even more on getting the 'Trilogy' album. Instead check out 'Delerium', there latest 2 efforts have been very good and they appeal to Enigma fans."
5,The Real Thing,"Original in their art; fantastic music, modern, sensual, sexual, animalistic. They are wonderful artists. I really enjoy this compilation of Enigma's works. Others try to copy what they do, but pale in comparison. So happy to have them in my collection. :)"
4,exellent album for anyone not just CDB fans,This is one of Charlie Daniels best efforts! Ain't no Ramblers Anymore and We Had it All One Time are my favorites both are great ballads. Partin' Gal and Ragin Cajun tell great stories too but are rockin' tunes. Taz contributes Lady in Red which is reminiscent of Jitterbug and Tom Crain lends a hand with Nashville Moon.
3,Needed to sharpen the tip,"This worked OK after I sharpened the tip with a file, but the tip was pretty dull when received, and thus it didn't want to slip under the staples.FYI, Home Depot has a Husky-brand version for a dollar more, and its tip was already sharp."
5,Great little tool,"After using a screwdriver to remove small upholstery tacks for my first several reupholstery projects (and risking stabbing my hand many times), this tool makes my life much easier! It functions just like the claw on the back of a hammer but on a smaller scale for little nails, brads and staples. The angled head makes popping the nails out simple with a quick motion."
4,Screw driver,"As most stated its a great tool for removing smaller things that a claw hammer simply can't.The one I recieved was black and red, not much of a design difference but still, its about the size of a normal screwdriver just that they bent the last half inch and split it. Great product and no real complaints about it."
5,A Must Have Tool for the DIY Upholster,"I looked at many of my local hardware stores in search for a ""tack puller"" or ""staple remover"" and came up empty. Couldn't find one with a narrow enough head for the small staples I needed to remove on a kids recliner project. I thought maybe just a screwdriver might work well enough to remove the staples. When this tack puller arrived, I was amazed how much easier this item was to use to remove those staples. Amazing! Made the job so much easier and quicker. Completely recommend getting this item if you are looking to reupholster anything. :D"
1,Probably won't use this much.....,but i bought it and I'm not big on sending back 6 dollar items. I should have known better anyway....the foot is too thick to get under a staple and the tool itself is unsteady because the shaft is way too long....should be about half the length and have a larger curve to get leverage as you remove the staple.......
5,Introduction to A course in Miracles,"I had recently decided to attend A Course in Miracles locally, and wanted a better idea of what I could expect from attending these sessions. This was very helpful and answered a lot of questions. It was shipped REALLY fast and was a smooth transaction."
5,Truth to set you free,I am almost though the book and feel it to be very truthful and uplifting with a lot of enlightening information. Though it may not be the most popular it is written and channeled in truth. It is teaching us the ways to the Miracles of heaven. I highly recommend this to any spiritual teacher and also for anyone brave enough to attempt to teach others how to change the course of this planet into a Heaven on Earth.
5,A helpful tool,A helpful book to aid in understanding The Course in Miracles. This book simply states the concepts in a way that is easy to read and interesting.
1,waste of a book,"this book is completely useless, does not help in the least. if you want a book that breaks down a course in miracles, get ""a return to love"" by marianne williamson."
1,Introduction to A Course in Miracles,"This short, concise booklet explains A Course in Miracles much better than I, as a new student, could. I cannot conceal my enthusiasm for the Course and that always brings up the question, ""Just what IS A Course in Miracles?"" The booklet seems to have been written for just such a situation. I am happy to have it."
1,Bold Balderdash: Silliness Introduced as Theology,"""Introduction to A Course in Miracles"" simplifies an overwhelming three volume set of theologically skewed ideas. These ideas aren't well-founded in the long version; they aren't well-founded in this introduction. And, the book manages to insult thinking Catholics and Protestants in the process.The connections ""A Course"" has desired to make with Christianity is only the loosely, most fallible kind. While Williamson would not say this is Christianity, I think she'd say it is consistent with Christianity. It isn't.For the new age believer, buy this book. For the Catholic or protestant, don't get buy this. You'll simply feel your intelligence and spirituality insulted, and that the authors belittle you because you believe in one God in Christ.I do not recommend ""Introduction to A Course in Miracles."" It is remarkably deep in superficial new age thinking, offering only confusion to society.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.blogspot.com"
1,Scary Stuff,"""This woman who had written so eloquently that suffering really did not exist spent the last two years of her life in the blackest psychotic depression I have ever witnessed."", these words were spoken at helen schucmans funeral. In the worlds of ACIM, ""It would be madness to entrustsalvation to the insane."" & ""Anyone who elects a totally insane guide must be totally insane himself."".Also the co-author guy has once worked for MKULTRA (an inhumain CIA mind control experiment(look it up on wikipedia)). Very scary.This book makes me respect the bible when it says ""beware false prophets"". So many people seem so false to me.In my short time on this earth I have witnessed two psychologists tell me that people are able to make decisions and change there lifes, both while showing clear body language to the contrary. As people we all try to profit from making up lies/illusions/stories, I fear this book is no exception.Dont look to the shiny marble institutions think for yourselves."
3,"GREAT camera, except one thing","This camera is fast, easy to use, and has very few faults that I can complain about. I bought mine 13 mos ago, and have been very pleased w/ photos. I'm an amateur, and am not blowing up large pics. BUT, I would not buy this camera again, as it has NO ability to take low light shots. At my daughter's Thanksgiving show, only 10 or so pics were clear, out of the 70 or so that I took. The cameral REALLY struggles when the light is low. My understanding is that just about all digitals struggle with this. Its very irritating, and unfortunately, no manufacturer seems to address the problem."
2,a paws book?,"i was looking forward to use this book. there wasn't much ""meat"" in it. it was repetitive. this could be a how to book for elementary school or junior high. the previous reviews showed five stars (!). my word! i noticed all the previous reviews are from los angeles, california -- maybe from the same writing group of seniors? i was going to return it,but that's another waste of postage."
5,Compelling & Historically Accurate as Hollywood Can get,Son of The Morning Star is an anomoly in Hollywoods treatment of historical material: It is 90% historically accurate. Custer is depicted ( a great Gary Cole ) as the half mad / half sane egocentric individual he was according to historians. This is no heroic crock like 'They Died With Their Boots On' or cartoon Custer depiction like 'Little Big Man'.Striking perhaps most of all is the shown banality of genocide and it's seeming normalcy. Just like real life.The film has the feel and psychlogical under current of a Documentry film. James Riddle
4,Good enough to get you started reading the real history,"Without a doubt, this is the best fictionalization of the Battle of Little Big Horn available today. I have watched it many times and the acting and overall effect eclipse the saccharine Dances with Wolves in every category including the musical score. If you are an historian of the event, armchair or otherwise, numerous inaccuracies and omissions will strike you as they did me. That is the beauty of this movie: it stirs you to find out the real and complete story. Read the books including Grinnell's, the books on the recollections of the Arikara scouts and Lakota Noon, the Story of Wooden Leg etc. and the Hearings on Reno's role that tell you so much more you need to know to understand this event. The desire to do so may be this movie's most lasting legacy and its greatest tribute to the Native Americans and soldiers who died June 25 and 26, 1876."
4,"If you liked the mini series, you'll enjoy this!","Excellent, thoughtful music. If you enjoyed the mini series as much as I did, you will certainly enjoy the memories the soundtrack brings to mind. My only carp, No Garry Owen! I wish the mini-series were on DVD!"
4,Crazy Horse Was A True Hero,"This movie was marvelous in it's portrail of the Sioux chief Crazy Horse. It's contrast between the over eager, and slightly insane, Goerge Custer and Crazy Horse was executed flawlessly. Whereas Custer was fighting an unjust war of expansion and acquistion, Crazy Horse was fighting to protect his oyate, his family, and his tribal nation. This movie was very well made, historically accurate, and highly educational. A great, if indirect, tribute to someone who should be a celebrated American hero. Crazy Horse of the Lakota Sioux"
5,"Loved the movie, but how much longer for the DVD?","Despite being a made for TV flick, this is my fav Little Big Horn movie. I don't know why it takes what feels like forever to reprint VHS versions to DVD whith all the high-tech out there, but like Zulu Dawn, another of my favorite war flicks, it seems that the conversion of celluloid to digital is as slow as molasses in January (that's January in Norther Virginia, and baby, it get's cold here!). I found the acting of all the characters excellent, the storyline, wonderful, the action super, and the perspective from both sides, the red man and the white man, excellent, and the atmosphere convincing, although there is not much grit to the era in the movie. Just stop farting around and get me a DVD version and make me a very happy fan."
5,Custer at its best,This is an excellent account of the events up to and during Custer's Last Stand.It is just unfortunate that it has not been released on DVD yet.
5,Love It!,love this cookware. I purchased the set a year ago and wanted to add more pieces. cooks great and cleans up easily
3,Love it / Hate it!,The pan itself is very heavy and even heavier after adding food/water to it. I am just using it as the bottom of a double boiler.
4,Solid Product,"I am a 65-year-old bachelor who, before retirement, used to eat out 90% of the time. My retirement income has forced me to make some changes. Cooking to save money is one of them.This is a sturdy, moderately heavy pot. Though it takes some time to heat up, it heats uniformly. It is also easy to clean. Overall, it is an excellent choice for the price."
3,Cuisinart Multiclad Pro 2 qt and 1 1/2 qt pans,"I like the pans as they cook evenly and are sturdy. However, I absolutely do NOT like the handles or lids. It is very difficult to lift the pan and pour out its contents. Too bad a good product has such an obvious design flaw."
3,Handle on lid gets very hot,"I love the saucepan. The handles on the saucepan stay cool, but the handle on the lid can burn your hand. I gave this a 3 star. The saucepan is a 5 star and the lid a 1 star."
4,"Good quality, good price, good product overall.","This pan is perfect for a 1 or 2 person cooking. It is good quality and it works great. My only complaint, and the only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars, would be that with the time the steel doesn't look great anymore, and that I stopped putting it in the dishwasher because it seemed to increase the discoloration.But this is mainly a esthetic thing, the pan works great anyway."
4,All great but the handle,"This pan looks great and performs great. It's less heavy duty than All-Clad, but unless the kitchen is in the middle of a stone quarry it is plenty, plenty heavy duty enough. And it looks great, too. In addition to the price advantage, another lead over All-Clad is the turned lip. One disadvantage, though, is the handle. It's not a light pot, and when it is full it is simply heavy. The handle is not broad/thick/shaped enough, and there is no helper handle on the opposite side. It works, certainly, but the 2006 version could be improved."
5,great value for money,"I have two or three pots and pans from this line and all work superbly and at a lower price than competing multiply equipment. I think it's important that the central ply of aluminum go all the way up the sides as opposed to being just in the bottom, but I have no scientific evidence for this. Note that these pans have a fairly high heat capacity; this means that they retain heat for a while after being removed from the heat source. On the stove top, the handles stay cool though."
5,excellent value for price,"This sauce pan does the job, has even heat distribution, and is easy to clean. The price here on Amazon, especially when there is a special price, is quite good. Much less than the equivalent all-clad. It's moderately heavy."
5,Fantastic!,"I'm really enjoying using this pot. I just switched from my old baked-on enamels and shopped carefully before deciding on 3-ply stainless steel. This pot has all the features of the more expensive multi-clad brand but for a much more reasonable price. The handle does stay cool, by the way. It's easy to clean and a very useful size. I did buy a couple of stainless steel pans with the 3-ply bottoms only (not totally 3-ply all the way around). They are not the same quality at all, and food burns onto them much easier. The worse part, however, is picking them up. They are unbalanced in my hands and they are hard to wash because of this unbalance. Really, 3-ply is worth it. Cuisinart really has a good thing going here!"
5,"Excellent, rugged pan that I am sure to use for a lifetime","I grew up using copper bottomed Revere Ware that felt solid, but was easy to burn unevenly in the bottom. This pan heats perfectly even, like a dream. It also cleans easily. My only complaint is that the handle on the lid can get a bit hot. I would highly recommend this item."
3,Lid's Very Loose!,"09/08/12: New 4-qt pot is beautiful I am replacing twoSimply Calphalon Nonstick 4-Quart Saucepans(finally deciding that non-stick isn't a good idea to eat from). So far, one BIG complaint: The lid simply rests on the pot and has copious wiggle-room to boot. Not equivalent to the quality of the pot. In fact, I just went back to the item's page and found, ""Tight-fitting stainless steel covers"" as a benefit. Not my pot! I have another arriving on Monday. If its lid is also loose, I'll be returning both.I will update this review."
5,This is professional!,I purchased this 3 quart saucepan and really like how strong and sturdy it feels. It is easy to clean and cooks food evenly. I don't put it in the dishwasher and just hand wash it with hot soapy water and dry it by hand as recommended in the manual. I also purchased the 1.5 quart pan as well. I received the saucepan one day before the estimated date which was great surprise.
3,NOT 18/10 Stainless (as the description states),"I ordered/received two of these pans from Amazon: a saucepan, and an everyday covered saute pan. The design, weight, construction and quality of both seemed very good.However, nothing on the items, the packaging, the included information, or even the Cuisinart website or customer service confirmed the stainless steel used was 18/10. -In short, I returned the items as ""not as described"".18/10 steel formulation is a HUGE selling point for cookware and cutlery. If the pan were made of 18/10, the manufacturer would proudly label it so. -Amazon needs to update its description."
2,Great pan!,"Bought this pan along with one all-clad and one Calphalon - for comparison purposes. This pan came out on top. Wanted to test before splurging on the set. The handle is so much more comfortable than the all clad pan and obviously much less expensive. Will see how they wear - but so far, so good. I performed a boiling test and water boiled faster with this pan than with the similar All Clad. Though it's nice to see the food through the lid of the Calphalon pan, I am a little uncomfortable with a glass lid, and the shape of the Calphalon lid creates water pooling when the lid is lifted, which then spills onto the stove top or into the food. But, I like all three products for different reasons, just decided to go for the Cuisinart based on price, looks, and so far cleans up great. (I would rate this pan a 5 star - must have hit the wrong button on the initial review)"
2,Stay away from Cuisinart cookware made in China,"Ever since Cuisinart started to manufacture cookware in China their products became of less quality. I have 2 saucepans:1.5 quarts made in Indonesia which I bought in 2004. It has very good 3-ply construction (stainless steel, aluminum, stainless steel). After 5 years of everyday use it has shiny interior and exterior surfaces. It does not show any signs of wear. I was so happy with it - I bought another one.2 quarts made in China which I bought in 2007. I did not pay attention to where it was manufactured. I thought the company should keep the same quality no matter where it builds its products. This saucepan already discolored and can not be cleaned. The rivets are covered with stainless steel only on interior side. The exterior side of rivets gets oxidized. It may be the cause of discoloration if you put it in dishwasher.Stay away from Cuisinart cookware made in China."
4,Like it,This is a weighty pot. I haven't tried it yet but have no doubt that it will perform well. It looks and feels great. One caveat...be careful what you use to wash these pans. My cover has multiple superficial scratches because I used the rough side of a scrub sponge on it. My mistake though.Thanks.
5,Wonderful soup size pot!,"I bought 2 of these to supplement a 17 piece set of Professional Series Cuisanart Cookware. The set did not come with small saucepans, so I had to find others. Bought these and have used several times. I love. They heat up well and their style compliments the Professional Grade set I had purchased. They are sturdy and have a great feel and weight to them. I highly recommend these pots."
3,Spins excessively on a flat surface,"I'm the opposite of a cooking expert; I was simply looking for a nice new saucepan for my induction stove. Unfortunately, the item I got seems to bulge out a bit in the bottom. Basically, it spins around pretty freely on the flat surface of the stove. Yes, you do have to be more careful since there's less friction on a flat cooktop, but other cookware I have does not wander around quite like this.The overall build quality is excellent apart from that, but I'm not a fan of cookware that spins just from nudging the handle... If I jab at it just right, I can just about get it to do a 360 in place!If I was using this on a more traditional gas or electric stove, I'd probably give it 5 stars, but that's not what I bought it for, unfortunately."
4,Love it!,"I love it. I've always used nonstick cheap pots and pans. What a huge difference this makes! You can actually see the rolling of the boil instead of just bubbling. You can see a little discoloration (teeny tiny bit) where the water line was but I consider that ""seasoning' like when you season a cast iron pot. It's beautiful (not that this matters in my old kitchen) but I love it. The only thing I would change is I wish I had gotten one with a clear glass lid."
5,Very nice sauce pan,"This sauce pan can take a beating and is a great, multi-purpose pan. It is not non-stick, which makes it versatile and can withstand higher temperatures and even the oven. It's surprisingly easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and can handle a brillo pad if needed. I've been very pleased with this pan and will replace my older pots and pans with the Cuisinart MultiClad Pro line as needed. I do have a few All Clad pans and feel this one gives you more for the money, and doesn't need to be babied."
5,Cuisinart accessories,I bought the 12 piece Cuisnart multiclad cookware set over a year ago and was so impressed that I wanted to add too my collection. This cookware is wonderful and cooks evenly and clean-up is a breeze. I use Bar Keeper's powder cleanser. I know this cookware will last me forever. I highly recommend it.
5,LESS than half the price!!!,"Shopped around for this product (already owned one, needed another) this was LESS than half the price of Dept. stores -- love Cuisinart's saucepans, good weight, pouring lip, easy clean up."
3,disappointed after reading great reviews,"I needed to replace one Revereware pot and couldn't find something that seemed to be as good quality that wasn't in a set. Then I found and read a number of reviews on the Cuisinart cookware. I was excited to get the pot and use it! But then, when I got it and used it, I discovered two things about the pot's design that should be improved. First, because of the design of the lid, when you remove it, it drips water all over the stove top unless you hold it over the pot to let the water drip into the pot. That's not a problem unless you didn't grab the lid handle with a pot holder. Then you want to move the lid fast - and then you leave a water trail behind you as the lid drips the condensation. The handle of the pot has not gotten too hot to hold so that's accurate with what I had read. I like the look of the pot, but, obviously, you buy pots and pans to use not to look at! Could be improved, in my opinion."
4,Nice size for cooking,"I like the long handle. Whether I boil eggs or make rice, this size is perfect for me. It cleans up easily. The pot itself is painted black and should be kept away from sprays like oven cleaner. That's why I give it only 4 stars."
2,Retains heat too well,"I cook ramen in this. The pot stay hot long after I take it off the stove, which prevents me from drinking the ramen soup. Grrrr back to the classic saucepan I guess"
2,Cuisinart Multiclad Pro,"I read all the reviews and choose to purchase the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro.It looks great and handles nice. I used it twice and my food has a metallic taste. I tried boiling water in it several times to get rid of it, but didn't have any luck. Very disappointed!"
5,Ah! mazing.,"I can't stop listening to this album. I listen to it on the way to work and by the time track nine, ""Bottle Glass"", I have to walk slower so I can hear the end of that song before I walk into work. As a result, I've been late a lot lately. This is the G.C. album that fans of their live show have been waiting for. It's sloppy and loud in all the right places, and even though I know they worked hard, the record seems perfectly effortless. This is really grand."
4,this CD f'n rocks,"This album is great. I foubd it on their website which I cant post here but you can probably figure it out. hint: starts with G ends with N. I got it upon hearing their first album after seeing their kick ass live show at The Mercury lounge in NYC. It rocks start to finsh. The songs span a spectrum of influences but always stick to their middle america indie-fied roots. you hear 1980's punk, 1940's country, and 1970's rock all strewn together for a unique contemporary sound. buy it now. They are at CMJ in NYC this month go see them!!!"
1,Broken audio connection,"I bought this headset discounted at Marshall's (maybe that should have been a warning sign). It never worked properly. I use this for PC gaming. The mic works fine, but I had to constantly jiggle the connector to get sound through the headphone. Eventually the audio stopped working entirely. Now I use it only for the mic, with chat coming out of my PC speakers.If everything worked well, this would probably get 3 stars from me - as other reviewers have complained, the headset itself is fairly uncomfortable for any period of time longer than a half hour."
2,Quality But Not Comfortable,Got this headset because I was tired of cheap logitechs. This headset is definatley well built but it also squeezes your head and can give you a headache. Has good sound but ear piece is so big if you rely on hearing sounds in your game you can really only hear out of 1 ear. I gave it 2 stars.
2,Head Coach Mic...,"I agree with Socom's Finest here, hurts for extended periods of use, and only worked for about 2 week of actual Socom play before the mic gave out. Very dissappointed purchase on this one :("
4,Another excellent resource -- a companion to Solo Training,"If a person has this book and Christensen's Solo Training, then they have the groundwork for practicing the basic fundamentals of Karate (and other martial arts) with all the various ""one-person drills"" they might need to assist with technique. Certainly, one's own Sensei and system will provide bunkai, kata, and wazas or ""one-steps,"" but these two books provide a solid foundation to use to drill yourself and monitor yourself with basic techniques. I recommend them both as essential reference for the martial artist. R, Shodan, Okinawan Shorin-Ryu"
2,Could have done better.,"I expected a lot more from this book. It seemed very basic. This book might be a good book for a beginner, but for anyone who has had even the slightest training, this book would be almost a waste of time. Out of the whole book, I have learned just two new things. The rest wast just common sense."
5,"Fun, interesting, and useful","Neat advice. Interesting and fun writing style. Useful facts, drills, and tips. As always Christensen offers solid information for serious martial artists. I liked it a lot.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"
5,Another incredible book by Loren Christensen,"Once again, Loren Christensen has put his money where is experience is. This book is a veritable encyclopedia of fight facts, drills and common sense. It shows that he has spent his 30 plus years experience in the martial arts training, teaching and researching. I cannot say everything about this book so it's best to keep it simple - buy it, train with it and you'll be the better for it."
1,A book about him,"This is just a book about what a bad ass this guy thinks he is. Its amazing that my friends who are cops have never gotten into a situation like this guy seems to get into time and again. Don't waste money on anything by this guy, you won't learn anything except how awesome he thinks he is."
3,For those that don't know the facts already.,"I normally wouldn't bother writing a review, but if I had read a review like I intend mine to be, I probably wouldn't have bought the book.I like the author and I enjoyed his writing style. He knows what he is talking about. If you are a regular Karate student that trains in a gi and goes to a studio/dojo three times a week and is concerned with tests and ranking, you will probably benefit from this book. It's a great book for a Karate/Tae Kwon Do student who needs to learn the difference between the dojo and the street, but not for someone who already understands the difference.There is solid and sound advice on nutrition, working out with and without a partner, and ways to improve speed and performance, but if you have even a modest backround in critical martial arts practice and you are just looking for a few new arrows to put in your quiver, I don't believe this book has much to offer you."
1,Nothing to learn here,"There are two main problems with this book.1) It should be titled how to make yourself a better Karate student, not a fighter. Many of the sections cover things like Kata, Belt evaluation and tournament prep.2) Every piece of advice in this book is common sense or ridiculous. For Example:- Train more- Train hard- Solo train if you don't have a partner- Use a Heavy Bag- Avoid Gang Members- Stretch- Train while watching TV- Focus on building up your weaker ""Karate"" techniques- Take Creatine- Do Aerobics- Do daily affirmationsYou are far better off with ""Attack Proof"", which teaches some real drills to improve Agility, Balance and Co-ordination. This will help you regardless of what Martial Arts your practice."
1,Is that 60-feet as measured by gnomes?,"Pros: noneCons: barely illuminating at 15 feet, severely overheats, wickedly overpricedI bought one of these a couple weeks ago for about $45.00. Even at that price I feel I was robbed - I can't believe this thing is listed for over $80 now. If you are reading this review, stop looking now and find something better/cheaper."
1,Re-consider this product.,"I purchased this item for UFO/Paranormal investigations. When I used it early this year 2010 during a Bigfoot investigation, I noticed it would turn on for 15 minutes then turn off for 15 minutes. Thinking it was the cold temperature doing it, I used it again March 13th during a Ghost investigation. Still the same scenario. This really sucks for my needs, and I'm currently looking for another product to replace it. I'm going to replace the power adapter hoping it's just over heating, but this item could have a thermoster built in turning it on and off. Bottom line? It works fantastic at 15 minute intervals. For more information on my investigations, go to my ufonut website."
1,Dim very quickly,"These lights wear out very quickly. After only a couple of months, this light was about as half as bright as when I purchased it. Now, it barely illuminates at all."
3,They work...,"They run hot to the touch and definitely don't give 60' worth of illumination. At 30' they give something better than a flashlight pattern, slightly wider and taller..."
4,"Bright, but has a dim red glow","I bought this light to supplement the IR light from a Motorola baby video monitor. Based on the other reviews here, I decided to buy the Skylink WS-100/WS-100N Wireless Remote Control to remotely turn on/off the IR light to prevent it from getting too hot. The IR light output is very good."
4,Connections is a great way to get students to write.,"This collection of essays with the prereading questions and suggestions for further thought works to get even the most reluctant students to express opinions. The essays are organized around thematic units such as ""Roots and Arrivals,"" ""Family,"" ""Ways of Learning,"" etc. When I have used this text, I have found that students -- even those who hate English -- find themselves discussing and writing about what they have read. The focus on making connections with people from different cultural or experiential backgrounds also helps to prepare students for an increasingly diverse world. The only drawback to the book is the lack of really useful information on writing. However, I find it easier to develop my own guidelines for students; and the thought-provoking essays make up for this lack."
4,Item as described,The item was as described.Only issue was the date of estimated delivery was off by a week! But still happy with the order and pleasure doing business with the person.
3,Good but not worth [the price],"The book is really good on the job it proposes itself to do, which is describe the rules of flag football as the USFTL sees it. It is a tedious reading though, and some of the rules could have gained a better explanation instead of just stating the rule used. The quality of the publication is very poor and I expected more for [the price], it is a small book, but not small enough to carry on your pocket and the quality of the paper is very low, with blackened graphics. The book really surprised me regarding the referee manual, and is the sole reason I gave it three stars, specially because you could get all those rules over the internet, the reading is detailed and very instructional. The book is good only for the referee manual, look for the rules over the internet, and it is filled with propaganda which could have been used to diminish the price of this extremely expensive book for what it delivers."
4,Great Product for the $$,I bought this for my hubby. It works great! Not as powerful as others on the market..but works for what we need. It definately fills the bill and blows the leaves off our carport and patio.
5,Excellent product when paired with weed eater rain gutter kit,"Excellent blower power for the cost... also bought the gutter extension kit by weed eater and works like a charm to remove ALL the debris in my rain gutters... the pieces fit really tightly together didn't have any issues at all, as compared to reviews of other rain gutter kits i read about."
5,Worth it...,"I did not expect much from this little blower, but it packs a punch! I will admit, this is my first blower since I am a first time home owner, but I do not feel the need to get anything bigger or better than this blower because it suits my needs. I no longer have to sweep my driveway or sidewalk, and it's ergonomic enough that I don't have to adjust my grip or ""shake it off"" when I get a cramp, because that doesn't happen. I am very happy that I didn't spend more on a blower because this thing does the job just fine."
5,Weedeater Leaf,Great no nonsense leaf Blower. It is a snap to assemble and a easy to use. Don't get a 2 speed as one is all you need. I would recommend this to anyonea leaf blower.
1,a glorified hair dryer,"i bought this miserable excuse for a leafblower as my old electric weedeater leafblower died after nineteen years of abuse i gave it.it was made in indiana ,i dropped it more times than i care to remember.it was so old that the plug socket pins were in such bad shape that i glued in an extension cord with pl premium.i got seven more years out of it.it would blow the clothes of your back,god, i miss it.enter the new weedeater blower, or should i say glorified hair dryer,i used it twice,very weak,it would not be a pimple in comparison to my old beloved weedeater blower.on the third time i switched it on,nothing,totally dead,useless is an understatement for this miserable counterfeit.i woud gladly pay double if i could get my old weedeater made in usa back .sadly this cheaply made imported knock off is all that is out there.i gave it one star because the box it came in was nice looking,but that is where it begins and ends."
4,Easy Use,"The weed eater web160 is well worth the price paid. Its easy to use plug n go, no more clogged fuel lines and messy oil/gas mixing, strong enough for my yard work clean up needs."
4,Blowing in the wind,Weedeater is working good. This is for light work. Don't expect a whole lot of power. It does what my wife needs it for.
4,Very lightweight and easy to use.,"I wanted a reliable, lightweight, way to cope with an abundance of fall leaves, and it delivered."
5,Well pleased with this product,I don't use this often but when I do I am very pleased with it. Very powerful for its size and easy for me (an older woman) to hold. My son has borrowed it for his yard and he is very pleased with it also. I don't think you can do better for the price. I recommend it.
4,Nice & Light,"Perfect for blowing leaves off the driveway/patio. Light, electric, not terribly noisy - all in all a good blower. Definitely recommend."
5,Works well!,"I love this weed eater. When I told some folks I purchased this one, they made fun of me, saying it will not last beyond one use, it is cheap...I used it all summer to blow leaves off my patio, using it sometimes everyday because of falling debris from nearby trees. It is lightweight, easy to use - just right for a woman. Never caused me any problems. Even my husband, who questioned my decision when I purchased it, likes it and can see how well it serves my purpose. I would buy another one if I needed it."
4,This product does work with the gutter attachment.,"I use it to clear my gutters on a two story home. There is push back because of the length, but I hook it over the gutter and turn it on. I turn it off as a move along the gutter. It does work. I still must use a ladder, a little more length would have helped."
5,Hard to set this book down!,This is a very exciting fiction thriller. Editorial warning:It's difficult to set this book down once you start reading it.
4,The Star Shines Through,"Of all the Patsy books I have read lately, I must say this one ranks high. There are photos I have never seen, plus excerpts from Patsy's letters. The author gives you a good sense of who Patsy was and where she came from - without all the tabloid-like writings of other books like this one. If you are a true Patsy fan, you will really enjoy the quotes and anectdotes from friends and family that knew the real Patsy Cline...who comes shining brightly through in this great piece of writing."
4,Some great examples to follow,"The preface is written by a former tutor of Alf Cooper's, Martin Goldsmith who is quite correct in saying that this book is a good laugh and is easy to read. Nevertheless, it doesn't lack good spiritual lessons. Personally I found Cooper's consistent habit of early morning prayer a fine example to follow.Cooper takes us through his experiences and beliefs which led him from existensialist-humanist-Marxist to Pentecostal Anglican vicar. Throughout the book I found it difficult to know whether to side with him or not, especially, for example, on page 60 where modern-day prophecies are being made.This book can be read at a fast pace and is quite enjoyable, especially where he writes about church planting and evangelism activities in Montserrat and Chile.Apologies: I have not mentioned Jane Collins, the co-author, as this review refers to the MARC Publishers version of this book."
2,Not worth the money,I was disappointed with this book. There appears to be no organization and the information does not appear to be accurate. I expected much more and this book did not deliver.
4,Desiree,"Desiree is a movie I saw as a child and liked very much. I wanted to be able to see it again (and again, and again). It stars Jean Simmons in the title role and Marlon Brando as Napoleon - both in their prime.It's the embellished true story of a young woman who was at one time engaged to Napoleon, but later married to the man who became the King of Sweden. (Desiree and her husband are, in reality, the ancestors of the current Swedish royal family, which contains some very beautiful people.)The movie is visually beautiful; the story is compelling; and the cast is something to behold."
5,Oldie but Goodie,"One of Marlon Brando's most passionate roles. Very romantic and beautiful sets. Realistically portrays France during the time of Napolean Bonaparte, with all it's decadence and luxury."
1,Hated it.,It looked like some one sat in front of the TV when this movie was on and taped it. Sent it back for a refund!
5,Super flick.,"While not exactly true to history, I very much enjoyed the film. I first saw the film in the late 1950's. Thank you for making it available."
4,Chinese copy of very poor quality in regards to colour,Unfortunatelly I can not pass this DVD copy import as it has a very poor quality of colour. I have seen the original DVD copy of this movie and it was superb. The replacement copy is on its way to me and I'm awaiting to see if is improved. The seller Pre Codes have been highly proffesional and I'm happy to deal with them. The new copy sent to me as replacement is brilliant and of high standard. Big thank you to the seller dealing with me in highly proffesional manner.
4,a good solid historical romance,"although not totally historically correct, desiree is the story of the spirited daughter of a silk merchant who was napoleon's first love. she went on to marry jean-baptiste bernadotte when napoleon married the more politically beneficial josephine. the marriage was better for desiree since jean-baptiste was a soldier who rose from the ranks, became one of napoleon's marshals, one of his biggest detractors, one of his conquerors, and eventually king of sweden. all through this time is the rivalry involving desiree as well as the struggle for power and the thrones of europe. jean simmons gives her usual good performance, marlon brando is a convincing napoleon, and michael rennie shines as bernadotte. a very watchable movie."
2,Not worth the cost,"NOTE: this is a review of the DVD, not of the film Desiree itself. As a Brando enthusiast, I was desperate to get my hands on this. I coughed up the cost for it because I had been trying to track it down for years. It ended up being obscenely expensive, especially once the shipping came into play. I'm glad that I got the opportunity to see the film, but this is a very bad transfer. The aspect ratio is distorted, the audio track is muddled and the colors are muted and washed out. If you're a big enough Brando fan, you might want to pick this up out of desperation. Otherwise, I'd recommend looking for other alternatives."
4,Desiree',"This movie was just as I remembered it on my very old VCR tape. It is not a remastered copy, but is very viewable just the same. Very good quality."
3,Retraction of previous review,"Previously gave melsaution negative review. The recepient of the review contacted me with a thoroughly reasoned explanation that satisfied me completely. My attempts to retract the, erroneous bad review, were not successful. Amazon's web site is very easy to navigate when purchasing, but bears a strong resemblance to the Discover Cards TV Ads, featuring ""Peggy"", when you have a problem."
3,"good, not specific enough for needs","This book is good for general knowledge, not exactly what I was looking for but will keep for referencing. KP"
2,Boring,I just couldn't get into the characters. It seems that they were constantly going over in their minds how they felt about each other as well as their own inadequacies.
4,Wonderful hero!,"Alex is a superb hero: part irredeemable wastrel, part tortured young man, part charming rake, part lonely man, and part clever hero. He's really terrific, marvelously complex. Octavia is smart, resourceful, and resolute and a good match for Alex, although she's not quite as ""real"" as Alex. The two young people are beautifully rendered and very realistic.I always find myself steering away from books set in Russia (for some reason), but it didn't throw me off too much here. If there are problems with this book, they're in the plot. Too often the situations they encounter seem staged, too convenient for moving the plot forward. However, Alex (and the kids, to a lesser extent) raise the book up from its problems and make it a real pleasure to read. 3.8 stars."
4,A gem of a book...,I probably wouldn't have found this little jewel of a book had I not read a terrific review of it at allaboutromance.com. The writing is superb and the unusual setting (Russia) was unexpected and welcomed. I came to really care about and respect the characters and I felt their struggles to be real. There were two child characters who enhanced the story and helped the plot. I will definitely be looking for more books by this fabulous author.
2,SpamKiller Maybe,"Not exactly what we expect from their advertising. Doesn't do much better than Outlook Express Mail control program. But now you have to operate two programs, this one and your main email program. Not worth the effort."
1,no beter than standard outlook filters,"If the people who said this limited spam had spent as much time configuring their outlook filters as they have to spend on configuring spamkiller4, they would have saved their money."
3,"Great for the Completist, But Not One of Tom's Strongest","Many have recommended this disc and stated that the vocals blend well together. I find the most interesting aspect of this disc is that both of their voices are complete oppositets. Tom's most recent solo releases blast this disc out of the water, but for it's time, it was a good disc. Personally, I would prefer to hear a female vocalist with a little less polished and perhaps more interesting sound. In addition, being a soundtrack disc, the disc sounds very disjointed and the songs do not flow together well. As a backdrop for a movie (which I have never seen) they probably work quite well."
2,Awful; really awful.,"I love Crystal Gayle, and I think Waits is great. I haven't seen the film. I just came across this CD at the library, and was intrigued to see what two such great artists could produce together. It is not worth listening to. I gave it two stars just based on the fact that they sing in tune, and it has professional production values. It is the kind of album where one wonders when is the pain going to stop. There is too much good music out there to bother with this."
5,Hihgest value¡¡,"Just read the previous review: it's exactly as it is.Don't miss this one. DVD-Audio sound is worst than digital 5.1, that's strange, but anyway, great music¡"
2,You can do better,"Halfhyde has the chance to cover a neglected part of military history, but the writing is sub-par, and leaves me shaking my head. There are big concept problems (lieutenants repeatedly smarting off to admirals and getting away with it, for one) and other issues that mar the series, and I just can't recommend it. Too bad! Such a rich topic and era, and so poorly done!"
2,McCutchan not up to snuff.,McCutchan is not the writter that many others are. The stories are not closly related to reality. They must not be well researched.
3,perchase this if you have read batman: year two.,"It seems the reaper is back in gotham, but we learn right away that it's the son of joe chill, the man who murdered bruce's parents. not only must bruce confront him, but his greatest fears too.heros: batman, robin, James gordan, leslie thompkins.villans: {flashbacks} joker, two-face, penguin."
5,I would recommend this CD to everyone,I have the album from long time ago and I just love the music. I bought the CD to play in my car so I can listen to it on the way to work.
2,Defective cd was delivered to me,All the 4 items l ordered were delivered to me by my brother upon his returfoot Malaysia after attending my nephew's graduation in US. All items were well sealed individually and were again sealed as a package. But I am extremely dissappointed with the cd by Bertie Higgins as the first track of the cd (Just Another Day In paradise) was blank(ie no sound). The rest of the tracks are of good sound quality. I lodged the complain slightly late as the cd was delivered to my nephew's address in US to save cost and my brother collected it when he attended the son's graduation. I hope you can give me a replacement without having me to send back the cd as the mailing cost is exorbitant .Tks & Rgds.Sim Seng Kee.
2,Tools not for beginners,"I purchased this book as a complete beginner to calligraphy.The instruction book includes good instructions for forming the letters. The projects in the project book seems interesting. Unfortunately, there are no instructions for using the tools.I've never used a calligraphy pen before and I could not figure out how to load the ink and get it to write. I tried dipping it in the ink and that didn't work either. I will probably end up going to an art store and buying a different kind of pen.I purchased this set because I was hoping to get everything I needed to start. If I were to do it over again, I'd buy a different book and purchase pens and ink at a store where they can show me how to use it."
5,Gread Deal,"A great deal for the price. The nibs are of good quality, nice starter selection and the material included is some of the best that I have bought. I bought several fountain pens, dip pens and different inks to keep me busy during the long winter and this is probably the best purchase I made. Out of 4 different calligraphy sets that I have purchased in the past, this one is by far the best deal for the price. Enough material to keep me busy for a very long time."
3,Nice calligraphy set,"Not high end by any means, but fun to experiment with the different pen tips, and the books are informative. We were able to purchase this for far less than the list price, which seems a fair deal given the quality of the product. Probably wouldn't have been happy paying full price. Good set though. My 8-yo tried it out, but it's a bit too advanced for him."
1,Received with empty tool tray,Product received this date [01-AUG-2007]with white tool tray empty. My last straw with amazon.com -- Please cancel my account.
4,Great TGIF memories!!!,This show was and is one of my favorites! i loved this show when I was a kid. Every episode makes you laugh. Highly recommended for families!
5,what do we have to do?,"what do we have to do to get all seasons of this amazing show? they seriously need to stop waiting around, get it done already!, this was my fav. show. i need the other seasons on dvd!"
5,LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I watched this when I was young right after ALF (RPN9). I loved it and I've been looking for a DVD about 2 yrs ago, but this DVD wasn't released yet. The moment I saw it on the shelves I bought it right away and the laughter it gave us on 4 DVDs was well worth buying this. My 2 daughter (7 and 13) found it really funny (they watch it in the car and I love to hear their laughs while I'm driving), and they tell me a lot of episodes were copied by Disney Channel programs (Jake and Josh, Hannah Montana...etc). Just the look on Larry's face makes us all laugh. I'll buy 3rd/4th season once released on DVD, for sure."
5,Dancing With Joy!,Our older children loved this show years ago and our younger children love this show on DVD!! Very funny and the humor is not dated - as good as I LOVE LUCY - everyone will love Balki and Cousin Larry.
1,scratched disc and missing a disc,"I ordered this in July for my son's birthday. I usually shop early. We just got around to watching these DVDs today. The second disc skipped and the 3rd disc is missing completely. I am very disappointed. I guess I should have opened them and watched them when I received them, but, what fun is it to receive an opened birthday gift? Since it is past the window to return the disc, I guess I will have to reorder these, but you can bet, I'll watch them as soon as they come."
4,Great Show,"This entire series was full of great shows. The first 2 seasons are not as great as seasons later in the series, but still some great episodes.What's extremely strange is I just now hooked up my old vcr solely to watch my perfect strangers tapes and then decided to come here and see if it was released on dvd and it was just released a couple days ago! I had not watched any of these in probably 5+ years and then when I do it happens to be right afetr it was released on dvd, unknown to me?This series does not have reruns on tv currently, so this is definitely worth buying. I would just copy my tapes to dvd for myself and not buy dvds, but the quality of my tapes is too bad. :)Anyway I think most people would like this series. For those who never have seen it, it's definitely a classic show. Probably not as well-known as some other shows of its time, but great great show."
3,What we need to know is...,"Is this a set of uncut episodes or syndicated cuts? Because if it's syndicated, forget it. I'll save my money."
3,This isn't the Perfect Strangers with Larry and Balke. These are not the actors from the tv comedy sitcom. Please reply.,Appears to be the wrong video. Not the tv sitcom with Balke and Larry etc. What is this?
1,Definitely not perfect!,"I think we all remember this show with fondness when it first appeared in the mid eighties. Well, time has moved on but this show hasn't;it is still firmly rooted in the eighties - the 1880s! There's no easy way to put it - it's awful! Better stick to comedy that will stand the test of time like The Honeymooners, Wings, Cheers (the Kirsty Ally years especially), Seinfeld (barring the final season which was a stinker!), Arrested Development (the first two seconds yes; third season reaks) and Benson. It gets one star for the wonderful theme tune. As for the other reviewers who give this show 5 stars I say: ""Don't be ridukulous"""
5,"We all want to do the ""Dance of Joy""",This is the greatest tv show ever made. my whole family enjoys it. We need it to come to dvd as soon as possible. whoever is in charge needs to make this happen for all us fans. thanks!!!!!
5,I love this show,"I am ecstatic that this show will be released soon. I have been waiting forever for this. There is a whole cult following for this show. I am a die hard fan. Would love to see it on DVD that will be so cool.""ofcourse i do, dont be rediculous"""
5,Just as I remembered them!,"I was worried that this cherished childhood favorite wouldn't be as funny as I remembered (b/c let's face it...sometimes you just can't go back), but I soon found myself laughing out loud. These episodes were great. If you looked forward to Friday nights and enjoyed the show on the TGIF lineup like I did in the 80's, please don't hesitate to buy these. The humor is still fresh and their hilarious physical comedy is still entertaining. I do so hope that WB will release the rest of the seasons. I would purchase every one on DVD or even be happy w/ an on-demand option. In the words of Balki, ""Don't be ridiculous!""...release the rest! :)"
5,Great show!,"My husband watched this show growing up, so this Christmas I wanted to get him this DVD set. This is my first time watching them and I have to say they are wonderful. You can definitely tell they were done in the 80's but who cares? The two actors are wonderful comedians on their own but together they are fantastic. Their timing and chemistry is great. We've already watched through the first disc and have enjoyed our time laughing. A treasure and I hope more seasons are released soon!"
5,When you rollin out the dough....just make sure you roll it slow,Give me a break and release these episodes already! This is the best show that was on TV in the 80's. Can't wait to be able to go to the store and pick it up to enjoy.
5,We need more Balki!!!!!!!,"Please release Perfect Strangers on DVD! It is still my favorite sitcom of all time. I haven't seen anything funnier! It's whip-smart, the physical comedy is just amazing, it's clean and family-friendly, and there's usually a moral to the story without being preachy.It was once on TV late, late, late and I set my alarm to watch it. It's hard to get back to sleep after laughing that hard.My favorite episode is when they try to fix Jennifer's shower. To this day, I still say the line, ""That spackle must be amazing stuff!"" I've since had my own self-improvement nightmares -- though none were nearly as funny.Bronson Pinchot is amazing in this show. I got the opportunity to see him in Stones In His Pockets. He can do voices and characters like nobody else.Oh, and if Bronson gets some royalties from this, maybe he won't have to do The Surreal Life ever again! It's Baba Sticki! (Sorry, Bronson, but really...)"
4,skips on one show,I really enjoyed the dvds but one episode skips and freezes.One other reviewer said the same thing about it.I would send it back except since this happened to others what are the chances it wont happen again?Other then that I LOVE this dvd set and plan on getting the the rest of them when and if they come out.
5,lots of fun,sure brings back memories of the good old days! even my 7 year old son and 4 year old daughter can't get enough of Balki and Cousin Larry's antics!wish they would release the other season episodes
4,Very funny,"This tv show is hilarious, especially for Bronson Pinchot. He plays Balki who comes to Chicago from a tiny mediterranean island and the fun is about the shock of cultures and different ways of living. The picture quality is pretty bad though, no remastering here. But the fun of the show makes it worth it in my opinion."
5,I found the set online !!! All Seasons!!!,"If you go to warner brothers. Then search perfect strangers. A link came up that has dvd collections from the 60-90s etc...Anywoo... ALL 8 seasons of Perfect Strangers are on there for $150-$250 depending on the sale. No I'm not from that company, I just wanted to find cousin larry !!! Go get em'!!!"
5,One of the Best TV Shows Ever Made,"I don't know what the hold up is, but I really hope this show is released on DVD soon. It seems all other shows are on DVD, even crappy little TV shows no one's ever heard of. This is an excellent family show based on a completely original idea. Larry and Balki are hilarious! I know for a fact I will buy it and I know tons of other people who are waiting, too, so what is the hold up?"
5,"Wake Up, America!","In reading the reviews, I find a common thread -- besides the fact that we all loved the show! PS was a wholesome, descent and moral show; one the kids could watch. Current sitcoms are indicative of the subtle but moral decay of our society. Shows like Seinfeld and Will & Grace (to name only 2) would never have been shown in primetime back in the 80s. It's no wonder we want shows like Perfect Strangers on DVD -- there's little else on tv! We've got Andy and Gomer; bring on Balki and Cousin Larry!"
5,Outstanding printer,"I love the Pixma Printer. It's easy to use and the instructions make all the features very understandable. This printer will make clear, clean copies every time. It's easy to install and use. It makes wonderful prints from your digital camera and is easy to use for that purpose. The small screen shows you exactly what picture you will be printing. Great copier for the money - a good value."
1,Better throw your money away,"I haven't had this printer for very long. I have purchased legitimate Canon ink tanks to replace old ones. I keep getting the messaage ""more than one ink tank of the following color is installed."" IT IS NOT!!! Sometimes it works if I take it out repeatedly, but for the last couple of weeks that hasn't worked either. If I put a new ink tank, it works temporarily and then I get the same error message. I wish I had known this. I had always had a tremendous respect for Canon products; however, after looking at all the complaints online regarding this same issue, and then finding that the Canon support web site does not even mention it, I am disappointed and will never buy a Canon product again. What a waste of money!Canon PIXMA iP6700D Photo Printer (1441B002)"
5,Outstanding refurbished printer,The six ink tanks (disappointed I couldn't use the ink tanks from my Cannon 6000 - 6700 ink tanks require a chip)produce outstanding photos. I can still refill the tanks as I did with the 6000. The refurbished printer is working like a charm - no problems. Refurbished computers are a completely different story - stay away.
2,prone to jam--a design flaw?,"Canon pixma ip6700dI have owned this printer now for more than a year. Twice it has suffered a paper jam in which the paper was inaccessible inside the printer. Although there is a local warrnaty station (in Dallas), the distance is such that a roundtrip would entail 90 minutes or more. Therefore I returned it to Canon and received a refurbished replacement, which also jammed. I have now received a second replacement (also refurbished) but have limited its use mostly to large photo prints. Most text I print on a much less expensive printer with less expensive ink. I have never used the paper tray provided with the Canon and use only good quality paper. Very good results with previous Canon printers. A design flaw here!"
2,TRASH!,"Love frustrating encounters with devices that don't work as they're supposed to? Then you'll love the iP6700D! This printer seldom does anything for me without fifteen minutes of fiddling and cajoling. It's not that I do complicated things with it, or that using it is particularly complicated. It simply does not work most of the time. For example, the bluetooth won't put out a signal until I turn it off and on several times. Or the paper tray thinks it's empty when it's got half a ream sitting in it. Or it thinks one color of ink is empty when it isn't. Ink runs out quickly, also, and is extortionately priced; but that's pretty standard for a printer. Mainly, this printer is just TRASH and DOES NOT WORK RELIABLY."
4,Prints wonderful pictures!,"I bought this to replace a previous PIXMA model. This one prints faster and looks better than the previous one and supports the newer inks from Canon that are supposed to last 100 years. The only issue I've had with it is it saying that I have two Photo Cyan cartridges in it, when I've only put the cartridges in that came with it. It doesn't always say this, just occasionally. And sometimes it will complain that it doesn't recognize the Photo Cyan cartridge. I'm still using the ink cartridges that came with the printer, so I'm hoping that when I go to buy new ones this will take care of the problem. I've had similar issues before with other printers and it just turned out to be something weird with one cartridge and the new ones worked flawlessly. But, it's still a great printer! I wouldn't buy anything other than Canon printers after the last two PIXMAs I've owned!"
5,Great value for the price.,"All that I expected. I have always used canon printers including the i960 photo printer before going with the 6700D. It prints photo lab quality prints and is fast and quiet. You get good ink usage with the 6 individual ink tanks. They generally retail for around 14.00 each but you may find them a little cheaper online or on e-bay. You will go through the photo magenta and the photo cyan the most. Setup was very easy as installing the print head and the ink cartridges were very simple. The included software was adequate although most people use there own program. Although some reviews said that the text was just adequate,I found it to be fine. Remember,this is mainly for printing photographs and it excels at that."
3,Canon PIXMA review,"Feedback on choice. I spent a lot of time reearching which printer to buy, not just on features but on ongoing costs. This is a better printer from all the reviews, blogs, visits with the product managers at CES staffing booths there, etc compared to printers in its class.However, I would not recommend it. I'd spend an extra $100 and get the Canon 9000--more functionality (scanner), let compromises when they made it multifunction.WIth this printer. great print quality. Okay set up. Had to reinstall sw twice Also,you'll probably need a print server as it is only USB out the back.Print ink modules are $13 from 3rd parties. Think but not sure cheaper than Canon but availability through 3rd parties suggests lower cost over the long term."
5,a great inkjet printer,"This printer looks, and works like a charm. It was extremely easy to install. Prints duplex with ease and has lots of other features. I haven't had it long enough to judge the ink longevity. Photos and color documents look very good."
2,"Horrible Support, but nice printer for as long as it worked...","I bought this printer because Canon is ranked #1 in customer support. I hooked it up and thought it printed fast and beautifully. It broke 1 day later. I contacted Canon and they sent me a refurbished one (I thought this was really weird since I had just bought a brand new one, but they told me that was their policy). The one they sent me did not work. Then they sent me another one and it didn't work either. They actually told me they were going to send me yet another one... Seriously!!! They would not send me a new one. I told them to keep it. I contacted Amazon and they were amazing!!! They sent me a return tag and switched me out to a amazing HP printer."
5,First rate printer!! Amazing!,"The Canon Pixma iP6700D Photo Printer is an excellent product, I recommend it without reservation. Set up was EASY, printing from media cards out of the digital camera works well too. So far, what I like best is the Easy Print utility that runs from the PC or laptop. Using this function, I can select photos stored on the laptop, arrange them on pages, correct as needed, and print them in less time than it takes to write this review! This is the first Canon printer I've purchased, and it is, by far the BEST printer I've ever owned."
3,Nice printer but....,"The Canon printer works fine but, like many of Canon's recent products (following the lead of other profit-mad vendors), the cartridges contain small chips. You can remove the chip and place it on a generic replacement cartridge but it is a pain. I should have bought the comparable HP that I have in my office. Unless you want to spend a small fortune on lousy inkjet cartridges, I'd avoid this product."
5,easy of use,"I have had and used printers all my life.B/W, color,laser, jet-ink. But I never had anythink like the PIXMA ip 6700D. It is so easy to use that you want to take picture just to print them. I have printed more pictures in a month than in two years that I had my Nikon Coolpix 5700. My only hope is that it will last a very long time. I like also the software provided by Canon with the printer, and the ability to edit pictures from the printer and completely bypass the computer with the same results."
1,Beware,"Ink tank detection started giving incorrect messages 6 months after purchase with ""Ink tank is empty."" No ink tanks were empty. But there was a way to override and still print. Now the message is the U071-""More than one ink tank of the following is installed Cyan 8."" Only one Cyan 8 is installed, and there is no way to override this message to be able to print. Technical support could only suggest replacing Cyan 8 or taking printer to a service center. Given the history of incorrect error messages, I am not investing any more money. I am trashing this printer after only 16 mos. Many customers seem to like this printer, but beware, you are playing Russian roulette if you buy this."
5,This is one great printer,"After weeks of checking out printers, I decided to Go with the CanoniP6700D. I had always had Epson, but for reliability and speed, the Canon is heads above Epson. I print all my own photos and am very pleased with the results on a variety of papers. My experience with Adorama was smooth and reliable. I will deal with this company again."
3,canon printer,I found the printer to be very good with the exceeption of the ink the ip6700D takes. To purchase all six colors cost almost as much as I paid for the printer. Not Amazons fault but mine for not investigating it better then I did. that is way I rate it only a three.
5,"Great pictures, printer easy to use","I bought this to make prints from old family photos that I had scanned. The setup was easy. The prints are absolutely gorgeous. I couldn't be happier. This is a very user friendly printer. It's my first Canon, but will definitely purchase from them again."
3,Mediocre Printer NOT Impress,"After extensive research on the printer and sampled printing, I decided to buy this printer in replacing my old Epson 320. I was not impressed at all with this Printer quality. I was impressed with the speed.I tried to play with the setting, but I found that it didn't help much. It did not have a sharpness adjustment, which i love so much with the epson. Color came out slightly better than the epson, and the speed is a lot, a lot alot faster than the old epson. I take pictures with a Cannon 5D digital 13 mega pixel. This thing makes the picture look like a joke!!!!Just for curiousity, I bought a new Epson 380. That printer kick butts. If you have to buy a printer....buy epson."
3,No support for network printing,"So far, print quality has been fine and we have enjoyed having dual trays to feed the printer. However, when purchasing this printer i took network printing for granted. This printer will not talk to our print server and Canon offers no alternative. As a result, we were forced to keep our previous printer for the other computers to use. How many printers do they think we need in this house?"
4,Fun to Watch,"These animated stories keeps your interest, and makes you want to see what happens next. Accurately involves Biblical stories. The little boy who is in the Flying House is somewhat annoying, showing anger, and throwing his arms around, when he is ignored, or doesn't get his way. But other than that, it is has fun filled stories."
5,Great intro book to SQL 2005 and XML,"I am not going to reiterate the reviews already posted. The other reviews have already lauded the good SQL intro but little has been said about the chapter covering XML. The author did a superlative job covering the intro to XML and it leaves the reader at a point where he can go ahead and read more advanced books on XML (I personally like the XML Pocket Consultant by William R. Stanek).If you are looking towards SQL 2005 certification, I recommend that you purchase this book first. It will give you the background you need before you start studying the books for the exams like the MCITP Self-Paced Training Kit: Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Database Administrator."
4,This Book will stay with you for a long time,"I read this book years ago but I can still remember it to be one of the best true crime books I have ever read, and I have read alot of them. I often wonder what became of the killers, Chuck and Marlene. One can only imagine. These two teenagers were definately evil and I can't imagine how they could live with themselves. The author should definately write another book on how these two wound up."
3,not all true,"Not all what u read is true!for one she did not do nine years in prison ! Two she lives a quite life away from people and her past! How do I know that? Well she is and has been a very good friend ,even after I found out about her past it was OK because she is not that person anymore and we all can change !"
5,Simply Gorgeous!,"This is such a wonderful book, It was such a rich and delightful read. It is such a moving, and uplifting experiencing, a breath of fresh of air that just takes you into another dimension of romance.The authors words are just breathtaking, a mixture of grace, beauty, power and passion...simply gorgeous!"
5,The Next Best Selling Author!,"Looks like C.Smart is a little green with envy...LOL Anyway... This book has it all, romance, passion, a beautiful and celestial love story, adventure, and sterling heartfelt poetry. I had to read it over and over again it was so amazing, I didn't want to put it down. When reading this book you actually get so drawn in you forget where you are. This is a book that can be enjoyed by the entire family, it screams fine literarture. Wright has such a way with words it is an art form. I couldn't beleive it and still wonder how he comes up with such beautiful poetry, well I guess that will always be a mystery. If their is an author to keep your eyes on, Kevin Brian Wright is the one. He definetly has the feel of the classics in his writing and you can bet he will be the next to be on the best sellers list. This is one book you have to BUY!"
4,a good holder,"ordered this holder after I asked my husband to drill the wall for another holder that requires nails n screws. And he pretty much screwed up the wall, he completed the work and I thanked him.. and the next thing I saw was the nail hanging off the wall.. he did that with much love!So I had to find one which doesn't include any hardware... I'm happy about it, its sturdy and serves the purpose nicely. Why I gave it four stars... ummm.. maybe I don't like the big magnets so apparent n visible.. it would have looked better if it was designed a bit differently.. magnets hiding behind the paper towel or something.Overall I like and recommend it."
3,Not quite what I had hoped for,"Well made paper towel holder But you must pull on it very slowly or the roll comes off in your hands. Also, the holder will sllde down the outside of my refigerator if I pull too strongly"
5,Works hanging too,"I'm using this underneath a cabinet. The feet (which would usually touch whatever surface the magnets were attached to when on a surface perpendicular to the ground) just hang loose, which works fine.It's been installed most of a week and not fallen down once. I have no problems with the magnets (as some reviewers have) however I am using it on 1950's painted metal cabinets that usually work well with magnets.One thing to consider is that you cannot choose which side the paper towel roll is loaded from. Mine and the pictures show it loaded from the right. If you are mounting this in a place with restricted clearance on the right, you will have to take it down to reload with new towel rolls."
5,Great product-- very satisfied!,"After reading some of the reviews I admit I was hesitant to order but soon surmised that it might not be the magnets on the paper towel holder but the source that it is applied. Some refrigerators are less magnetic (and probably more plastic) than others. That being said, I planned to use it on my steel garage access door because I can never find the paper towels in the garage when I need them. It works great. Also, the bend in the end of the rack keeps the towels from sliding off. Problem solved!"
4,Does the job...,"...but don't expect to be able to rip off a towel with one hand. It doesn't really work for that--the magnets are very strong, but the roll might fly off as it isn't secured on one side--the roll just slides onto one end of the holder. It's great as a space-saving alternative to placing the roll on a shelf or counter."
1,magnetic paper towel holder,it had to go on refrig sideways and it has no place for the bottom piece to stay on refrig. it moves andit does not look good. I never saw the bottom and assumed it could take any position and just not width wise. i will probably have to find another paper holder
5,Perfect for my stainless steel kitchen,Fits perfectly in my newly remodeled kitchen with all my new stainless steel appliances. Good magnets keep it in place. Very happy with it.
4,"Works well, could be sturdier","I have this mounted on my fridge, and it hasn't moved or fallen off in the week since I've had it. It doesn't feel very sturdy, so I still hold onto the roll when I tear off a sheet, but it's more to prevent it bending than coming off the fridge.One interesting thing is that the one I received isn't exactly like the one pictured on the product page. Mine has a little rack above the actual roll holder. This is nice because I can set things like a small box of ziplocs or a hand towel or something on there."
1,"Magnets Not Strong Enough, Slides When Towels Pulled Off","I was really excited to find this product at a good price. It would have been perfect, five stars, if the magnets were strong enough. I placed it on a metal cabinet that had been painted white, and while it stuck to it, the magnets slid right down the cabinet everytime I pulled a paper towel off.Then I tried it on my refrigerator. It is NOT a stainless steel refrigerator, which I understand have problems with all types of magnets sticking on them. My refrigerator has a very, very slight texture to it and again the magnets stuck but then slid right down the refrigerator everytime I pulled a paper towel off.So that tells me that it must work only on plain, unpainted, perfectly smooth metal, which makes it useless to me.Again, if the magnets were stronger so that it wouldn't slide down everytime I pull a paper towel off, I would have given it five stars."
3,Ok.....not great,"nice idea, wanted to keep the paper towels off the counter, but the magnets aren't strong enough and it moves around....otherwise, I would've liked it..."
1,Not great,"Very hard to find in local stores, tried to replace a plastic magnetic holder that finally broke down after many years, this was a disappointment! Hardly stays attached and paper towels fall off very easy, looking for another one again!"
2,wimpy magnets = frustration,"We were trying to free up a little space in our kitchen so we purchased purchased this product and hung it on our refrigerator. It succeeds in holding the paper towels, but the magnets are so wimpy that it slips when it is bumped and is practically worthless if you want to pull the paper towels off of the roll while the roll is still attached to the holder - that is just an invitation to have the whole contraption come off in your hands.I know they claim that they are the strongest magnets available, but that is simply not true! We do not have a stainless steel fridge, so that is not the problem. We also have a magnetic dishtowel rod on the same refigerator and it never slips. This product is a big disappointment."
1,Not Satisfied,"This product claims to be the strongest available, yet it is very weak and cheap. The magnets slide don't my refrigerator and I even have other magnets under it to help hold it up, the roll of paper towel I am using is a skinny roll and still that does NOT help:( I was sooo exicted when I 1st saw this item because I thought it would be perfect for my condo and to save space, but it stinks! SO My suggestion is save your MONEY and deal with what you have. Good luck, I hope this review helped someone because no one warned me and I wish they had."
5,WOW!!,"This is a god-send! I've been using one of those wooden paper towel holders, the typical stand up ones that you just set on a counter and it sits vertically. Luckily, this caught my eye on Amazon! It's so amazing and looks very modern and cute sitting on my fridge! It's so easy, you just slip a paper towel roll onto it and slip it off when it's done, and it's so nice and easy to walk over to the fridge and pull off what you need.The magnets that hold it up are VERY strong and I am never, ever worried about it slipping or moving around on the fridge. It stays put!"
2,This is okay,"I was looking for something I didn't have to mount on the cabets. This seemed to meet the requirment, but it does not hold the paper towels well when you try to rip a sheet off. Not very stable. It does stick to metal great!"
3,Good in Theory not good practically,It was what I was looking for but the magnets aren't strong enough to hold it in place while you rip a sheet off.
4,Just what I needed for the garage!,"I was searching for a paper towel holder to attach to the garage metal utility cabinet that would be accessibe but not in the way, stay in place, and hold the roll without coming off when you tear off a sheet. The magnets are very stong and hold the roll in place, however, you must pull straight on or it will slide if you pull at an angle. Even so, I'm are very happy with our purchase."
3,Could Stand Improvement,"In our kitchen the holder has to be installed in a rather awkward location. The magnets pivot on the holder and if it is placed ""backward"" the magnets stay in place but the rest of the holder comes with the towel that you're trying to tear off. It needs to be made reversible or be made with 'right' and 'left' hand models."
4,Magnetic Paper Towel Holder,"This item is worth what I paid. Shipping was great and timely. The magnets are powerful and hold very well. I only have one problem with it, the end should have something to make the paper towels more secure, the roll keeps slipping off, otherwise it is a great item."
2,Not too happy.,"I needed a magnetic holder for the basement to use near the washer. This was the only one I was able to locate. EVERY TIME I try to tear off a sheet, the whole roll of towels pulls off the holder. There does not appear to be any way to reverse the holder, so I have had to resort to using twist ties to hold the roll onto the holder. Not an ideal situation!"
2,Flimsy wobbly holder,"The magnets seem strong enough to hold the unit to the refridgerator, but the crossbars are thin and wobbly and the roll tries to fall off the edge when a towel is ripped off."
1,Weak magnets,"The magnets on this thing are not strong enough to hold up a full roll of paper towels.Every morning for the last week, I've had to slide it back up from half way down the refrigerator"
3,magnetic paper towel holder,Paper towel roll tends to slip off the last 1/3 of roll. Attractive presentation. Not at all disappointed. Very quick delivery.
5,great for my small apartment!,"I love keeping my counters pretty clear and this paper towel holder really helps me do that! The magnets aren't the strongest, but it works well enough on my fridge that it doesn't move or slide down."
5,Technically exceptional,Duina does well by going in-depth to explain how specific products' trade status is affected by Mercosur. Mercosur - the less discussed of the modern customs unions / trade blocks.
2,don Quichot blu-ray,"This is a nice production with lots of good, sometimes excellent, dancing. The experience is ruined by blurry, fuzzy video. I have all ballet blu-rays issued thus far and am familiar with the problems of recording ballet. I have never seen such poor video on a blu-ray. Arthaus should include some aspirin with each copy. You'll need it half way through the ballet.Don Quichot [Blu-ray]"
5,"On the eighth day, God made Ratmansky...","I'm going to start off by saying that Ratmansky is a fantastic breath of fresh air into the ballet world. In this day and age, if you have seen one Don Quixote, you have seen them all. Until Ratmansky's production. The costumes are beautiful and bright, invoking a true picture of Spain. The sets are innovative and the most creative I have seen in quite some time. The choreography remains faithful to Petipa and Gorsky, while small additions by Ratmansky transition seamlessly. I had become tired of seeing so many Don Q's that all looked the same. This one is different in all the best ways. The dancers are all lovely, and I found myself absolutely charmed by Maia Makhateli's cupid. If it's your first Don Q, you'll never want to watch any other. If this is your four hundredth Don Q, you'll be amazed and in love with Ratmansky's keen eye for reinventing the classics without ruining them. What a wonderful production!"
2,What a shame!,"I feel compelled to add my voice to those of the reviewers who have already complained about the awfull motion blur which afflicts this bluray...not only in order to (possibly?) call the attention of the producers to this problem but also to raise consciousness in general so that it will be less likely that such shoddy production methods will be perpetuated on future discs. In short, this is a very nice perfomance indeed, but who can really enjoy it if every single movement is blurred beyond recognition!! By the way, I looked at several other ballet blurays for comparison and found none of them to be anywhere near as annoying as this. I would say that the blurring on this disc is at least two or three times as bad as what I saw on others. In fact, it really wasn't an issue on the other blurays."
1,How could this possibly work?,"I can't understand how this thing works. It's hard to explain, but the tool is essentially like if you put your leather belt on a hard surface (a table for example) and took a AAA battery and tried to push hard enough on the leather to create a hole. There's nowhere for leather to go, so how could it make a hole? There would need to be a hole in the table for it to work properly (like a paper-hole-puncher has). The puncher part (the ""needle"" looking thing) is extremely blunt, and not at all like a needle, so no help there.It's a mystery to me how this thing could work for anyone. Am I doing something wrong? Someone, please let me know."
4,Works Well,"I received this product super fast and tried it out as soon as I received it. It works well, no real complaints. It is very heavy duty and does no look anything like the picture which was not a problem. I did have to punch the hole a few times to make an actual hole in belt. But to sum it up, it works."
1,Useless in real leather,"It pretty much ruined my leather belt. Once you punch the hole, the indentation stays on the surface. You keep trying to punch it over an over again and it gets worse. It will never create a clean hole. I hope I can find someone to fix it. I am so upset! my beautiful belt that I bought on my vacation to Spain."
5,I love it,"Initially I was worried that the product would be very small but when it arrived, I was amazed that it was exactly the size that I wanted. I love the product. Saves me money and time because when I went to a shoe repair shop to give more holes to my belt, I was charged $10 for two additional holes."
2,Flip Album 6,"I liked some of the features of this album, but when it comes to adding video to it, it will not accept .MOV extentions. BIG DRAWBACK - when I download any of my videos from my digital camera, it automatically changes them into .MOV extentions. So therefore, I cannot use any videos in my albums. Otherwise, it is really easy to use and fun to watch as the album flips."
3,Rising Stars,"Can I say DAMN! These boys are hot! Handsome, stylish, and they can really croon. What more could a girl ask for? ""Under a Spell"" has a catchy beat to it, but the rap kind of throws it off. No matter, it's still good to listen to. ""I Wanna Be"" is a great upbeat love song. Great for dedications. These guys are rising stars. They've got everything going for them. Coming from all different backgrounds and cultures they will touch many girls around the globe. Check it out. What could it hurt you could always return it right! But trust me this CD will be playing in your car for years to come. So check it out, you won't regret it."
5,vailtrail.com/ weekly shuffle/ CD Review by Samantha Donen,"The Double, Loose In The AirIt takes a couple listens to literally program your mind to hear what The Double is playing in their album Loose In The Air. Outside of the organ driven emo rock with neat beats and instruments, every time I listened to the album I heard something new. Loose In The Air is not instantly gratifying, but it does promise to remain as interesting and musically addicting as a Radiohead or Doves album. Web link: [...]"
2,review from Synthesis,"Hey, Matador! One Interpol is enough! With such a diverse number of bizarrely talented groups, it's baffling why such an established label would put out a band such as The Double. While Loose in the Air isn't a horrible album, frankly, it sounds like a collection of experimental Interpol covers. Upon hearing the scratchy, deep vocals of David Greenhill, one could see why such a comparison takes place. And while most songs are washed over with spooky, at times distracting, vox and Casio lines courtesy of Jacob Morris, almost every melody recalls a sense of deja vu. The epic ""What Sound it Makes the Thunder,"" with its climbing keyboard lines and feedback, almost makes one eat their own words, until the next song starts.- Nick WalkerSynthesis.net"
2,Had to skip to the end,"This book has an interesting premise, but I found it to be tough reading. Not to mention some parts of it were improbable: someone is killed at a writing convention and everyone sticks around? I would've been heading back home as soon as possible. Plus, there were too many characters to keep track of, and many of them were requisitely 'quirky' and eccentric. Just seemed a little too pat and bizarre for my tastes. By the halfway point of the book, the sheriff didn't know anything major and seemed to spend all his time talking to this writer or that agent. Plus, I had a hard time getting the feel of the sheriff; he seemed to be a cardboard character, a generic sheriff. No personality whatsoever. Finally, I had to skip to the last chapter or two to find out ""whodunit."" Maybe if the book had moved more quickly and not been drawn out to 250 pages, it might have held my interest more."
2,Not very useful,"This looked great in concept. Once I got it on my 7 year old son, who has a tall thin build, different story. I can push it down around his hips (so that his trunks are between the belt and his skin) and get him swimming, but as soon as he stops and gets upright, the foam floats pull the belt up on his little torso and the belt pinches. I'm going to try and modify it to make it work better...maybe use the excess belt to make a strap that goes through the crotch area to keep it in place. So far, can't really use it."
4,Good way to learn treading,"My 4 year old had to put some muscle into her treading, which I thought was a great way to learn. Unfortunately she is so use to her life jacket that this makes her a little nervous. I definitely would have preferred to have started her with this belt. It makes the kids focus and want to swim."
3,Good Belt but buy with FOUR segments NOT three,"The bouancy of the belt is very good and the quality is good, I bought the belt with only three segments thinking it would fit my 3 year old better than the 4 segment belt. WRONG. Depending on where you put the three segments (since it is hard to equally place them) it flips her either forward forcing her face in the water (which she is not ready for) or backward making it hard for her to learn to swim. If I had purchased the larger belt I could place one segment on each side and one in back and balance it with one also in front. It is a good product if you can balace the floating segments. I plan to buy the 4 segmented one since the 3 segments are basicallly worthless to me."
4,Good product for price,I purchased two of those belts before trip to san maarten for safety while snorkling purposes and must admit it worked. I wasnt scared of water and belt could help me float. Quality is far from american but price is too so i wouldnt hesitate and buy again. Overall good product
5,My [...] old can swim,My [...] old has been using this at her local YMCA (the 3 flotie one) and she is swimming independantly. I love that I can change the amount of boyancy by removing the bubbles as needed.
3,Grommet and no Wallace,"These are high quality grommets, but they have a tendency to bind on the tool shaft when assembling them. I've tried lubicating the tool first, but it still happens, and sometimes the lube stains the fabric, so I tried graphite with no better results. The finished product is fine, but t's frustrating to continually have to pry the finished grommet off of the tool. Perhaps a nylon insert might be the ticket. Not bad for the price though."
5,The End is NEAR...,"One of K.A.'s latest in her sci-fi series the Animorphs, is the answer to giving fans what they have cried for. The LAST great Jake narrated book ever with full K.A. genius. This book had the greatness of long ago written number 26, ""The Attack."" Which I would reccommend readers to also read. Many things are revealed in this book. Questions fans have asked and more... If you are an Animorph fan buy this!! If you're not, I'd recommed you start out with #49 and work ya way down to get the best out of this well written book!"
4,A rollercoaster ride,"I wouldn't call 'The Answer' one of the very best books in the Animorphs series, as it is only at its best the first time you read it. After that, some of the suspense is lowered. But it really blows you away. This is one of the few books I have not been able to put down. Jake's character changes completely, but it is a change that is needed to win the war against the Yeerks. One of my favourite parts in this book was when Jake talks to the Taxxons. I was really glad to see the return of Arbron, as he seemed to have been forgotten after The Andalite Chronicles. You must at least read the others in the ten part mini-series before you read this, but once you do it's a brilliant run-up, along with The Sacrifice, to the conclusion of this series. (The ending of this book is infuriating! I just wanted to grab The Beginning right away!) The end is near...."
5,The Answer,"You guys are all smoking something. this book rocked! it was sad to read about the visser killing off james and the others, but jake had to do what was necessary to win. if james and the others hadnt sacrificed themselves then they all wouldve died anyway when the yeerks won the war. anyway, i think The Answer was a very good book. jake allying with Arbron and the other taxxons was a surprise, but a good one. it was awesome to read how jake's plan took effect. highly recommended."
4,Good!,This book was one of the more gripping of the animorphs series. I found that I did not like the changes in each carachter's personality. I can't believe that Jake became so careless and aweful. I do not like that he blackmailed Erek or that he just might kill off Rachel....or that he KILLED OFF JAMES AND HIS ANIMORPHS!!!!!!He just wrote them off. He ordered them to come along. He should feel guilty. the overall quality was up to KA's usuall 5 star standard but jake's personality change was too much.
2,Stop at #52,"My daughter loved the Animorphs books #1 to #52. This book (53) she describes as very sad. The next book (#54) is really, really, really bad. My recommendation to parents is that they do not purchase 53 or 54 for their children, because ...*** Spoliers ***In this book, several popular characters die, the next book is worse. At the end of 54, everyone is enslaved to the evil villain. My daughter re-read the Animorphs books many times, greatly loved them, and after reading this book cannot enjoy any of them. Terrible shame. Very out of keeping with the rest of the series."
4,Good!,"I really liked this book, but one thing i dint like is how come Jake is suddenly so ruthless? I cant beleive how he blackmailed erek, after all he has done. I also dont like the way K. A killed off james and his people. was it worth puttin them in the story in the first place? Good but i dont like sum parts, thats y it is 4 star."
5,Jake ruthless?,I haven't read the book yet becuase I basically stop reading around 40 or something. So what's up with this James and his animorphs stuff? I think I might try to catch up and read all the books and the last one. If someone could catch me up on some of the series I missed that would be great. By the way what happend to that animorphs T.V. show?
1,So good it's almost scary,"I can't believe this album's sales rating is only 172,060!! It's so unbelievably good it ought to at least be in the top 100,000...especially with such a high customer review rating and the haunting vocal similarity to such stars as EllaFitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and even Barbra Streisand (in her more recent albums). If I could give it six stars, I would, but since I can't give it the rating it deserves I'll give it a 1, because it will always be Number 1 in my heart. I only hope word-of-mouth will be sufficient to bring this incredible album into the homes of the untold masses who haven't yet discovered the wonder that is Joan Bender."
3,"Unless you're running Win9.x, be careful","A great game as most reviews point out. I'm just here to point out a major technical issue. Unfortunately, it's so old that it won't install on Windows XP/Vista...possibly Windows 2000 as well."
2,"Fun, when it works","This game is a good introduction to the game Magic, especially for people who can't find others to play the TCG with, but it is very dated: Graphics are only 256 colors and the game is *full* of glitches, at least if you run it on Windows 95 or higher. There have been patches released for the game but even they don't fix all the bugs, and finding the patches isn't easy either since the game came out under the Microprose label, which was bought by Hasbro Interactive which is now Infogrames.It is nice though in that you can play with lots of Magic cards you'd probably never be able to find and/or afford in real life. If you can find this game cheap and don't mind glitches, go ahead and buy it, otherwise, wait for the upcoming Magic Online game."
2,Not Quite,"If you are looking for Magic TCG computer game that is worthy of the card game, keep looking. The few glitches that I found almost fully destroyed the fun value, and it is just not as fulfilling as laughing in a beaten opponent's face. Just buy the cards for a better time."
1,melody butchered in an 80s metal basement studio,"i love todd. he is my favorite artist. but this album is not todd at all. he would never approve of this lame reverb laden crap that someone had the gaul to release. whoever made this deal for ""with some help with my friends"" and this one..etc ended up screwing him big time. this is the same album as about 5 others-theyve been repackaged endlessly in the budget racks-all it really is is a 70s-80s gtr rockers angle playing along with trs tracks. its sad musically and i know he regrets ever having given whatever kind of consent got twisted into the this nightmare. as bad as it gets cause its a bunch of has been heavy metal fringe guitarists butchering todds tunes . stay away from this one-far away..its not todd at all..biggest mistake of his career to give permission for this chunk of crap.."
2,Go Back.,"Warning: This is the same recording as ""Todd Rundgren Re-Mixes"", minus 7 bonus tracks. I bought the two albums on the same night and was dismaye3d to find I'd gotten the same thing twice. What a rip-off. If you like Todd's voice and want to hear interpretations of his songs by other musicians, buy ""Re-mixes"" -- you'll get more for your money."
5,Excellent,Very nice book. Our daughters love it and spend a lot of time with it. Makes a nice present to little readers.
2,A Death Penalty Disappointment...,"While his efforts are to be commended in covering a topic that's been all but ignored in North Carolina historical research, the book falls well short of being a success...the book is poorly organized, factually incorrect in some places, and needs much in the way of historical and theoretical bolstering. Grammatically, this book will frustrate the reader, and while his research is somewhat exhaustive, the text is narratively choppy and poorly written. Overall, a disappointment on what could have been a fine piece of history."
5,GOOD WOORKBOOK!!!,"It is a good workbook for begining Christians as well as people that have been Christians for a long time. It gets you think about how our faith Christ makes a difference in the real world. The only drawback, of sorts, is that it is a daily workbook for groups so the participants need to be commited to doing the book daily!!"
3,"A better portrait than Amadeus, but too old for the classroom","I purchased this DVD to show my music history class while I was away at a conference.I always hesitate to show Amadeus to my students because it portrays Mozart as a bumbling, childish idiot, which, to my research, is not really accurate. This film, I feel, does a good job of portraying Mozart as a dedicated, hard working, phenominally talented though somewhat immature and impertinant genius.Costumes and sets are also exceptional.Unfortunately, the film suffers from its age: the acting is quite cheezy, the script is trite and unengaging, the colors are a little off... my students were unable to relate to the film. Ultimately, they were so distracted by these elements that they missed entirely the imporance of seeing Mozart in a different way than they already knew from Amadeus.As a movie for personal enjoyment - if you like old films and you are interested in the life of Mozart, I can highly recommend it."
3,A Little bit...,This was a disappointment...this isn't so toturing as other Japon albums! BUT STILL NOT POPULAR MUSIC!
5,This is awesome!!!,I couldn't be happier - my Yamuna Ball kit arrived quickly & now I would be lost without it! I use it intermittently throughout the day - just a few minutes on my sore areas reduces my pain.It is wonderful to be able to do my own accupressure as necessary.Love it!
3,Some ideas.,"This has been on my wish list for 2 years, and though it had some good ideas and some nice black and white pictures, it was hardly more than a taste of Oriental farming techniques. I didn't realize that the book had been written a 100 years ago. One lady went on a little tour of these countries and wrote a book about it. Still good, but not great."
4,Interesting,"Loved the history - very interesting for a book written and originally published in 1911. An excellent look at pre- industrial, pre -communist China."
5,The REAL Playboy,"Although Playboy is what it is, and because of the reason why many people purchase the magazine, there needs to be an understanding of the true content of the magazine through the years. Remember that the magazine is usually only 20% sex and nude women. That leaves 80% every month to be used for art, technology, controversial editorials, interviews, etc. This tome is huge and heavy, and I'm glad it takes the reader through a tour of 50 years of the COMPLETE world of Playboy. If you only want naked women, don't buy this - buy either ""The Playmate Book"" or ""Blondes"", ""Brunettes"", or ""Redheads""."
5,LCS on DVD...,I'm waiting for seasons 2 and 3 of LCS to come out.. I'm a HUGE Tammy Pescatelli fan... I can't wait... how much longer b4 that will be out??? I've been waiting years now!
4,Legends of Air Combat FA18 Hornet,"I give this DVD an 85 out of 100. Very informative but it has a few minor errors, the most notable being the mention that the US Marines fly the FA18E/F Super Hornet, which they don't (USMC is waiting for the F35B Lighting 2). Still, for $9.99 it is a good bargain."
2,hated almost all of it,The literature is moslty very old and very odd. I hated the class I had to take that I used this book for. All's quiet and things we carried were the only 2 stories worth reading. Good for target practice though.
5,Creative Learning,"When I first saw ""Bembo's Zoo:An Animal ABC Book"" I was struck by its beautiful and creative design. The use of colors and the inventive connection of the letters forming shapes of animals, caught my interest right away. Then I realized what effect that could cause on a child, and how interested one would get about learning the alphabet through such a inventive play between letters and figures. I think this book is a wonderful inspiration for those who are starting to learn the ABC, and a fun way for parents to help kids discover the complex world of language."
4,Won't last forever- always buy two!,Nice brush. Construction could be better. Stress to joint will eventually break it in two. That is why I suggest buying two so you have a back up. Soft bristles- softer than what you would generally find at a big box pet store.
2,"Good Effort, but with a Strong Tilt Westward","Readers interested in prehistoric western Europe will probably find these symposium proceedings of value. As usual, many archaeologists and anthropologists write with a laughable but annoyingly pretentious vernacular, as if trying to convince others that their work is truly scientific. [Added later to this review: Of course their professional work is scientific; I just wish they would explain it for a wider audience]. Unfortunately, only five of the 28 articles in this book deal with what one might consider the ""asia"" of ""Eurasia,"" four of which are in English. For those interested in the Asiatic side, an article by Richard S. Davis entitled ""The Implications of Improved Chronological Determinations for the Soviet Central Asian Paleolithic"" is worthwhile reading. If I were able to read French, I think I probably would have enjoyed the article by Miklos Gabori; at least the photographs of Tajikistan were worth a look."
3,So so but bad quality,"Wear for a year, 2 to 3 days per week, then the bottom sole fall off due to bad glue (I guess).Fit and feel is good."
4,Great Shoe,"The Reebok Men's Boyleston Running Shoe is a great Shoe for the price you pay. It is very comfortable, and the style is up to date and modern. I use it for Jogging and walking, I even use it a couple of times while going to work and to the Post Office, etc. Its a great shoe to put on for running errands, not just for working out. The only tip I might suggest is to get a half size bigger, if it is available, But if not, I wouldn't worry about it, for the price that there selling this, it is worth getting."
4,Gorgeous!,This book is full of wonderful photos! An excellent resource book for anyone who is interested in studying the visual richness of this medium.
2,Good photos but poor texts,I understand that it is almost impossible to write about many different centres of Islamic tiles but at least the authors should try but not just put a lot of color pictures of the tiles and write short text about it. This books is just good title and size.
4,Satisfied,This item has performed well and has continued to do so for the past year. The increase in speed of operation was below what was antisipated.
1,Why BUY trouble?,"PC Relocator UltraControl moves files, settings and utilities OK. But it claims to move all programs. Move a major program like autocad to your new computer, and it opens- but won't run. Then you see it has no un-installer in the program group. Next, you see it's not listed in the control panel add/remove list. Now- you have TRASH on your new computer, that can't be used and can't be fully un-installed. And I PAID for this? What was I thinking???"
4,goood but a little too much info,"it was a great book, but i thought it was sacry the the author (Lorelei Lanum) had to put the fact in that he doesn't wear underware. kinda scary too put into a book if you ask me, but ohter wise great! It was packed w/ info and very hot pictures of him, but still the underware thing i really didn't need to know. it kinda scares me now. i mean you read that and it says remember that the next time you look at him..........like i said, i didn't need that information."
1,Ary you serious,I would love to own this soundtrack but why anyone would pay 120 bucks is just plain dumb. Quite frankly I would like to see your copyright on this item to see if you are just Reburning these CD's and reselling them. For 120 bucks you should be reported to the authorites
4,"""Last Starfighter"" Music Exhilirating","Greetings, Starfighter. Quite possibly my favorite popcorn/sci-fi flick, Nick Castle's ""The Last Starfighter"" is a great movie. Lance Guest is terrific as the title character and the supporting cast, led by Dan O'Herlihy (Grig), Robert Preston (Centauri) and Catherine Mary Stewart (Maggie), is just as appealing.But where would a great movie be without an equally exciting musical score? That's where Craig Safan steps in with this masterful attempt. From the very first note of the opening title theme, the music grabs onto your ears with both hands and holds tight for the rest of the celluloid ride.Safan's score obviously found its inspiration from the likes of John Williams and perhaps Jerry Goldsmith, but the mood is fresh and with a spirit all its own. In fact, the film came out in 1984, and it's still just as new and exciting as when I first remember hearing it.A great movie, and a great score. Buy the movie. Buy the CD. Trust me, you'll like it."
2,not that strong,out of the dozens of skunk scents i have ordered in my life time this one seems to be the weakest.
1,This is a scam. Here's why.,"I found a way to get the same effect for free.Step 1: Purchase or capture a live skunkStep 2: Keep the skunk in a cage. Name him skunky. When you are about to go hunting, piss him off, and he'll spray you.Step 3: there you go! A free, less hassle, way to smell like a skunk."
4,great value for the money,"At first I thought I wasted my money buying these.But after I used them a while, I found I could really listen intently (in stereo) to phone calls.The microphone works too.The headset comes with two earbud sizes that you can interchange. I changed my to the smallerbuds and got a great fit.I would recommend these, specially at the cheap price.I didn't give the headset 5 stars because the microphone is a little funky. Sometimes I have to holdit up to my mouth to get maximum clarity, but still, it does the job."
4,Works well,"Since there are few headsets with the 2.5 mm jack, this was a great find. I'll admit however that the stereo quality is not as good as my regular in-ear headset but I don't know if this is because my phone produces inferior sound or if it is the earphone headset sound quality that is low."
3,received quickly,"received quickly and as expected, but product didn't work for my cell phone. No information provided for return purposes, so I was unable to return."
1,olivetti linea 198,they sent me the wrong product and kept me on hold every time i called to return it. when i was finalt able to return it they charged me $40 FOR SHIPPING. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN !!BEWARE-DANGER-DISHONEST PEOPLE !!!!!!!!!
4,ouality tools,"this blade does a real nice job, nice cross cuts in hardwoods, very clean, and squares good thanks to heavy plate,and probably good tensioning, the only issue was a couple carbids chiped alittle, no effect on performance, I would buy it again,,,"
1,Not even a contender,"This is one of most poorly-written books that I have had the misfortune to buy. This text is aggorant, and completely off-base, with lot's of mistakes and wrong conclusions. I wish I has passed on this turkey."
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money. This book teaches little beyond obvious truths, and it contains so many typos and error-filled code that few examples make any sense. To learn about UML, there are far better books. To learn about Oracle, there are far better books. Don't buy this one."
1,Poor writing makes this book impossible to enjoy.,"I had to buy this book for my graduate database course and I ended up returning it to the bookstore and getting my money back. This book is an example of most incompetent technical writing. From lots of inconsistencies in its text to poor wording and logical structure it made me hate it after a few first chapters.Conclusion -- Better, treat yourself with a nice dinner instead of this junk, unless you absolutely have to have this dull book."
3,Not Bad,"The book is a great book if you have never skateboarded before or if you want to learn about it. It spends a lot of time on what it is and what it is about. The book tells about the parts and pieces of a typical skateboard.... And it also tells how to ride a skateboard, but you don't really need the book... just get on a board and ride how you feel comfortable. The book also tells about the history of skateboarding as you go along in the book. And for the trick tips section....it just has the basic stuff like an ollie and kickturns. Nothing big, just the basics are in this book."
4,A Solid Beginners Guide to Skateboarding,"Doug Werner and Steve Badillo, founders of the Skatelab indoor skate park and museum in Los Angeles, provide a very basic overview of the elementary components of skateboarding. The material is very introductory covering skateboard terminology, beginner's tricks and moves, and details on the industry itself including the pro game.Trying to get a handle on my three year old's new obsession, I bought this book with the hope that I would gain a broad understanding of what skateboarding is all about. With an emphasis on fun and safety, Werner and Badillo have definitely achieved this. There's not enough in here to step outside and begin doing ollies, but after reading this book you will at least know a good one when you see one."
2,Not So Much,"I bought this book a while back, and it is O.K...but thats where it stops.There is nothing at all like watching in real life--or hey, why not TV how to start-up ur own tricks?Much better, and much more worth it--Check out this movie Skateboarding Explained!Its Wayyy more helpful and like i said--Much more worth it.You can check it out on Amazon or on MySpace..Hey give it a try?What you got to lose? haha, go Back to this book I guess if it doesnt help...but im telling you now--Skateboarding Explained is MUCH MUCH better!!Keep Skatin!"
1,Not what your paying for!,"I purchased 5 packs of these Grommet refills, none of the packs had the 24 advertised grommets sets. They all were short between 4 and 10 parts, in addition they were not even matched sets, you may end up with something like 14 inserts and 18 washers, if you buy several packs like I did, at the end you may be able to have more usable sets because the parts short on one pack, may be over on another. However, if you just buy one or two packs, be warned, you may not have enough for your project. Otherwise product is of good quality and easy to use."
1,"Good Product, Bad Service, Ace is not the Place","It seems anything I have ordered that used Ace Hardware as a source was horrible. Three weeks is absurd if it is supposed to be in stock. First off it did not even ship for the first eight days, then in came by the slowest method they could find. I will not order anything offered by Ace Hardware affiliates again. I doubt they actually have it in stock, but order once they have your money. I did not even come close to Amazon's estimate of arrival. Very poor service. They did the same thing with a cooler I ordered this past summer, and they do not respond to email. Avoid Denny And Kathys Ace if you expect good service. Ace is not the place."
5,On reading the Distance FroM Normandy,"This is quite honestly one of the best books that I have ever read. It is full of pain,loss,history, courage and hope.It is the story of healing within ones self and healing within a family.Baby boomers like myself,are given a tour of a world that we know nothing about.Mr.Hull's History lessons are graphic and soul searing. In my opinion he is one of the best writers alive. Thank you,Valerie Oviatt"
5,Sad and touching,"Both grandfather and grandson are more the same than they realize. Each generation feels isolated, yet is each going through the same sort of loss and fear over losing loved ones. I loved the interspersed flashbacks that Mead has; they show how much of a young, scared man he still is, even inside an older man's body. Highly recommended!"
3,slippers,"they starting coming a part after a year, but my husband said they where warm for his feet & he really liked them. I guess for the price not so bad because he got some use out of them."
1,Junk,"I couldn't even get it to load.. Way outdated, over priced, can't use it with windows 7. Wouldn't recommend this"
4,Well done,"Excellent account of Ft. Pitt /Duquesne and its use in the French and Indian war.Using written reports from both side and a familarity with the ground O'Meara does a fine job making a vivid picture of the English, French and the Indians (yes I said Indians) in between. You see all three sides in this quest for the control of the waterways vying for position and when possible using each other.This book was written in the mid 60's and the total lack of political correctness shows to the joy of the reader. It is a pleasure to see an author willing to call the roasting alive of a prisoner what it was , savage! That this is a parallel to some reporting of events to day make it even more relevent.One final note. The truth of the Fog of war is illustrated as both side seemed to have no true idea of what they were facing and were released from their ignorance only when events or luck overtook them. This is a truth of war that never ends.Very much worth adding to your home library."
1,BAD TRANSFER,"I don't know if this is from a professional company, but the transfer is as good as anyone with an old VHS copy duping it to a DV-R....basically, it's cheap-jack. Don't be fooled; maybe down the line Blue Underground or Synapse or some other exploitation label will do a decent job. Don't waste money on this; buy a cheap VHS and do your own disc."
4,good price good pruduct,"good price, good quality and it works. fast shipping but you have to pay for it."
2,Extreme Step,"This was not aerobically challenging enough for any serious exercisers. The strength work was o.k. I found Gin Miller to be particularly annoying in this video. Too sappy! It is good for those of you who like to hoot while you work out. I really liked Gin Miller's Reebok,""The Power Workout"". I felt very let down by this one!"
3,Excellent just wanted more.,"Love Jen Miller, another outstanding video. Love the new moves, side push ups, full circle turns etc. It's a tape for the advanced hard ""working stepper"" who has the ability and energy to do more. My only complaint I wanted MORE! (A longer version is wanted 7 minute warm up a full hour step and 8 minute cool down.)"
2,If you like step aerobics...,"then you will not like this! It is basically the same moves over and over. It is too dance-oriented and I felt like I didn't get that much of a workout. I have tendonitis in my wrists and couldn't do the side push ups with one arm as was shown. I do step aerobics for that reason, I don't have to use my wrists! I don't have the space that it requires and couldn't do the weight workout at the end because I don't have the ""Reebok Step"" and you need a long step to lie down on. Stick with the original ""Step Reebok:The Video"" if you want a real workout!"
4,Good Workout...but,This was a good workout. I thought Gin was funny- a little annoying but aaah who cares. I didn't really have the space required for this tape but you make do by altering the moves a little. The biggest downfall is that the video is not long enough. Its a great tape though-fun workout-it will keep you step workouts mixed up by adding this to your collection.
1,I almost completely gave up on Gin......,"After doing this video the first time. After buying her Intense Moves video I was soo impressed. But on this video the lighting is soo dark. They have a person doing modified excercises in the background, but it is so dark and she is so far back you can't see her! I am soo surprised at the great reviews on this one, but I guess to each his own. I thought she had lost her mind doing the slide into a one armed push up! It's not that it was too hard, but it was uncomfortable and she called the moves way to quickly for any fitness level. (my personal opinion only) The camara person focused on the top of the body when she was demonstrating alot of moves so I was wondering how the heck I was supposed to do the move. If I could have given this a -0 star I would.Tragedy......."
4,Extreme--ly Satisfying,"This is a great advanced tape. I have been having trouble finding ones that I think are intense enough and this one fits the bill. I enjoyed some new moves that are not on my other step tapes. It was a challenge, but not impossible."
2,"Not intense , no continuity in the aerobic section","It is not of continuous intensity, the step routines seem a bit monotonous,plus the fact that you need quite a lot of space on the sides of the step so that you can work out. Personally I would like more intense moves, more choreography ,as this video becomes a bit monotnous with a lot of repetitive moves usually crossing over the step and then down on the floor. I was disappointed as at the end of the day you neither get an aerobics nor a circuit training. I was dissappointed from Gill."
5,another lobel great,"my 2 1/2 yr old daughter just loves arnold and anita lobel's books. mr. muster is her favorite. She first started with ""A Zoo for Mr. Muster"" and just recently got this one. Mr. Muster books are short and humorous stories. Sorry there are only two of them. I read this to her before we went on vacation to the boardwalk/amusement park; great book to read before a vacation or after returning from one. Easy read, but filled with great excitement for the child."
5,Useful --yet entertaining!,"I love the way The Savy Consumer by Elizabeth Leamy is layed out. All you have to do is read a couple pages to get the info you need on a topic. I've already read the ones about getting rid of junk mail, getting a good deal on a car, and making collection agents stop calling. I learned a lot and you will too!"
2,Measure your window and air conditioner dimension!!!!!!!!!!!,This product would have worked great if it would have fit over my air conditioner. It did not and I had to give it away.
5,Paid for Itself First Day,"Got it to make speaker covers for my walker game ears. Cost of punch and foam rubber was about $27. Replacement pads cost $4 each. Was costing me $16 per set set annually. Made 30 pads today. Cost would have been $120. If you take out out the cost of this wonderful punch, pads $.13 each! Well made. Will most likely misplace or lose it before it ever wears out!"
5,Review 3/4 Arch Punch,"This punch is a great product, I used it to cut Matt Board and this punch did so very cleanly. The punch stayed sharp and continued to cut perfect holes after 200 in my one project. The China punches were cheaper however you get what you pay for they were dull and did not cut well.this is just my five sense worth, hope it helps.-Rusty"
3,Would read when lacking better choices,"Though the books intention is to lead the reader into considering one's mindset in marketing, it is too tedious when it could have been more directly to the point. If you like human interest stories, it is OK."
5,very good!,"It's very good book, like all Mary Higgins Clark's books, there is long intrigue, and it's hard to find the murderer. it's not boring, it's one of Clark's best book.I very enjoyed it!!"
2,about to exceed the time limit,"I bought a 365 count bottle. I thought this would be very good deal.It costs me less than I buy the 200 count one. However, when I receive it.I checked the production date. It is due to out of date in one month.I am very unhappy.In the seller's opinion, he/she thinks that a costumer can eat 365 tables in a month??"
5,The Perfect Multivitamin,Good price. (Why are some vitamins incredibly expensive?) And this size is right--this is not a horse size pill.
2,Stomach pains...,"I've been taking Centrum for a while, but this time I have frequently gotten stomach pains soon afterwards. Before this I had always thought it was a great product."
2,Sharp stomach pain every time,"I feel a sharp stomach pain right after I take centrum, and I know for a fact that other people suffer the same."
1,"Love the ingredients, can't take it 'cuz it hurts my stomach","I bought this at a different vendor (New Smaller Tablet Formula) and I am SO BUMMED because while this is the multivitamin that seems to have the best %DV of any others on the shelf, a few minutes after I take one my stomach really hurts. I've been taking multivitamins for years but this is the first time in a long time I've taken Centrum. I switched back to my previous multivitamin and the pain went away. Alas, I will have to get rid of these."
4,Bottle expires exactly one year from receiving it,"The bottle is exactly what it looks like, the only issue is that the expiration date is one year from the date I received it in the mail. I'm not exactly the best at remembering to take a vitamin every day (not to mention that I never remember to take them on trips), so there will probably be a few extra tablets that I'll have to throw away next year. Still a good deal for the bottle though."
2,This seller is very creepy,"He sold it for 13$ because it was expiring in 8 month, Di be careful for creepy seller,I preferred centrum to any other vitamin as they are the best with all required amount if vitamins"
4,sweet,"A story about a dreamy, misunderstood girl who wants to be a writer when she grows up. My 8 year old daughter loved it, and so did I."
3,Lasted a just under a year,"I commute 7.5miles every day. Not quite 365 but maybe 240. I bought this after a cheaper version disaster. 9 months later the bolt broke riding. I got that replaced under warranty. Not the weld has gone. I admit I have exceeded the load capacity in the summer once a week with softball but not that much. Its just not as well made as I hoped. Sorry. But its is better than some of the very cheap options, they lasted less the 4 months!"
5,Quality,The rack was perfect. Light weight and high quality. I've used it on some long trips and it has performed well. Easy on and off. Great system with the easy slide bag.
2,It's ok?,"I ordered this item for my bike in Iraq. the time for delivery was amazing but the quality of the rack itself is just ok. I love the fact that you just slide the bag in to lock but it needs some work. It does not slide in as easy as I would have expected. You have to line it up perfectally.The other HUGE issue is that the beam does not secure tight enough to the seat post. You have to constantly retighten the screws because they work themselves free. It would be ok if you used lock tight and don't ever need to move the rack but I do adjust my seat from time to time.I do have another bike rack that does tighten better and stays in place but unfortunantly I can't think of the name right now. I had to go to a bike shop to actually find the right rack for me, you might try the same."
4,Bullet,"This movie is a very realistic movie. Bullet is a 1996 crime drama film directed by Julien Temple and starring Mickey Rourke, Tupac Shakur, John Enos III, Ted Levine,Adrien Brody and Donnie Wahlberg. The screenplay was written by Rourke and Bruce Rubenstein. The film was released a month after Shakur's murder.Mickey Rourke was also the music supervisor of the film. It had limited distribution in theatres in US and was shot in New York with a significant portion in Brooklyn."
3,Rourke is magnificent,Rourke really buts the bullet in Bullet. his performance as Bullet saves this one from being a flopsum jetsum mess. Tupac is 'aight and the intense scene would have to be when hes the gang members start shooting in a restaurant with kids and civilians. Ted Levine has his moments as Rourkes strange?war obsessed brother and he evenges Bullets death at the end which was satisfying.
2,Not Mickey's best work,"I was surprised to see the high ratings that this film received from a lot of the viewers. This film is nowhere near the work that Rourke has been, or is, capable of. He's always interesting, but the character doesn't give him the opportunities that films like Angel Heart, Barfly, and Johnny Handsome, and Homeboy did. I think he wrote the screenplay as well under the name Sir Eddie Cook, but I may be mistaken. I can't wait to see Rourke in another role worthy of his talents. I'm looking forward to his work in the new Sean Penn film ""The Pledge""."
4,Pretty Good Film,If you watch this movie because your a wanna be gangsta and you think it will be cool becase 2 Pac is in it you will be disappointed. However if you want to see an intelligent film about the consequences of living a life of crime it is a pretty good lil flick.
3,It Has It's Moments,"Bullet was never released in theatres in the United States and that is a shame because it boasts the best acting Tupac Shakur ever did. Roarke is good, and the film has some great moments, but it never comes off because the plot and its characters are never fully developed."
5,bullet,"Bullet a veary good movie about gangstas that don't like each other ones white ones black.I loved this movie,you should get this movie not just cause it's a good movie,it has tupac in it, get all his movies to.I got them there all good."
4,A Man Who Struggles and Fails,"I've been checking out all of Rourke's movies after seeing The Wrestler. This one was good, but it had a few scenes that felt like they were rushed and thrown together. The acting was good though and Rourke's character is very complex and intriguing. My favorite scenes are when he is swinging his bat or hitting the boardwalks, remembering who he once was and what he could have been before the drugs and prison took everything from him. You really feel this guy's pain of a life wasted. Tupac also did a fine job and the older brother did a real good job playing the loony Vietnam vet."
1,Horrible,Big Mickey Rourke fan here but this movie was horrible. Rourke was good but the entire movie was just a big pile of dung. Don't even bother.
3,It was ok,Bullet wasn't Tupac's best movie role but it's a decent movie. Mickey Rourke for once doesn't do his method acting . The film has some decent cinematography and a chilling performance from Ted Levine as Rourke's brother. Maybe if more people had seen this film it would got the respect it deserves.
3,Bullet,"Talk about gangsta, go watch how a inmate shows no fear up against the legendary tupac shakur. Pac is a ill actor and better rapper as you all know, but in this he keeps it gangsta by blastin at his enemy. Mickey rouke is ill in this movie his role is kind of sad but revenge is what happens when you play wit fire..Def worth it to buy or rent..."
2,A rambling empty film,For a film that's supposed to be ghetto based with Tupac as a star it has about 5 minutes of Shakur and the rest is simply a walk around with Rouke's character walking around looking for a reason to get into the morgue or back in jail.High profile names do nothing for this film. Brody doesn't have the ganster film look....Rouke's character does nothing for me and Shakur's role in the film was just that of a gang banger.Recommended if you are a fan of any of the above.If you want to see a good film see something else.
3,What are these other reviewers taking about?,"This movie by far is not either of their best performances. To say it is their best no, far from it. The basic story line deals with Rourke getting out from jail and going back to his folks house. Who of course has a drunk for a father a mother whom puts up with them, a crazy brother and the brother with some talent. Same old story line. If you do watch this movie please do not expect much from it. I can see why it is a very unknown movie."
1,SUCKED!!!!!!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I thought I was going to like it because Pac was in it, but he was only in it for a couple of minutes and the movie was retarded. I should have just flushed my money down the toilet."
3,It's OK -- Made in China,"Another wonderful product from Red China. I have not used the files much -- only once, in fact. However, as I was filing some machined ALUMINUM, I noticed that the file I was using was already taking damage. If you're a fan of top-quality tools, and you're looking for files that'll do more than wood or plastic, you may want to pass this up for something else. Good luck with that."
1,General Tools S475 Swiss Pattern Needle File Set,"General Tools S475 Swiss Pattern Needle File Set was like #*it! It did not looked like the file pattern was cut, it was hit or miss. It looked like it was stamped out. Bad!"
2,Page protectors,"The page protectors cost about $2 a sheet and I was very disappointed by the quality. They appeared as though they had already been used. They were dented and scratched and unfortunately I surpassed the alotted time to return them, otherwise I would have."
4,Do their job,"i gave these a 4/5 because i only which the spine wasnt black (clear or white perhaps??)other than that, they are great and do their job."
