1,This phone sucks,I have had this phone for almost a year now and i have had nothing but problems with it and i think that it is a waste of time trying to use it.
4,Good for a low level intro course,"This book does a great job at discribing the conceptual aspects of basic p.chem topics like thermodynaics, kinectics and photochemistry. Unfortuently it only breafly explaines the mathmatical aspects and in little detail, making the book unsutible for anythig except a low level class. The book also suffers from a severe lack of practice problems. If you only need to understad the basic concepts of p.chem this book cannot be beat, but if you need to know the nitty gritty mathmatical deatials you will be hurting at test time."

3,Some thought provoking insights by a Christian Pluralist,"Smith argues from moral and theological grounds that there is a need to develop a world community which accepts all traditions as functioning means of knowing God. As a Christian inclusivist, my thoughts are somewhat different; but Smith does raise some questions which demand serious consideration. The first part of the book attempts to provide some insight into the inner life of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Chinese religous practice; but is largely unsuccesful to my own perception.Probably the most serious challenge Smith raises against traditional Christian particularism is the epistemological question, concerning other men's ""damnation"": ""How do you know?"""
3,Not enough of her sweet fanny,"Perhaps a little bit disappointing ... reviews and the movie, suggest an erotic performance, ripe 19-year-old virgin fights to keep her virtue. Set in an ancient, remote Neapolitan village, Sandrelli is the nice pubescent girl at a factory where the owner, gets an accidental peak at her underwear attempts to seduce her.Nonetheless I expected to see more panties and glimpses of her crotch ..Still the background is nice and storyline is nice.."
3,For my man,"I think for the price it was a great buy. Only problem, i really needed a bigger one and this was a little small. Still works good!"
1,8 month old broke her leg,"We have a slightly older version of this high chair--the features are comparable. I knew when I was putting it together that this item would require extra supervision given that it is so flimsy. What I didn't realize was that the buckle could be opened by the baby just leaning forward. After removing the tray for one second, with an adult less than three feet away, our 8 month old leaned forward and, apparently with just the pressure from her legs and belly, released the clasp of the restraint and tumbled to the floor. She bruised her forehead and fractured her femur. Needless to say, we were mortified. Please don't buy this product"
3,"Interesting Characters and Dialogue, Flawed Plot","I had a love/hate relationship with this book. On the one hand, I liked taking a minor character from a prior series and making him the protagonist, because it gives the series a sense of history and time. I liked the protagonist. There are a lot of books about young females and their relationship with ancient vampires, it's interesting to see the same plot with a gay male in the traditionally female role. I liked the interaction between Tony and the vampire Henry. I loved the dialogue, which managed to be clever and witty while still being like people talk. The plot didn't really work for me.The mandatory ""Big Bad"" didn't really fit in with the series, it looked like it would have fit in more in Tolkien style epic fantasy. Also, the ending didn't work for me. The villain was defeated by something that really wasn't introduced or explained until the end."
3,"Funny, not the least scary","First off, this is very good Tanya Huff - funny, sassy, well-written. But this is NOT an addition to the Henry/Vicki stories of yore. Henry just turns up in a few scenes to provide muscle. I feel the publisher 'bent the truth' slightly to get me to buy a book I would not have bought if I realized the story was not about Henry but more of Tanya Huff's fantasy. So I guess I feel gipped. But if I read it as just a fantasy, it was an okay story."
3,"Fun book, weak plot.","While it is a standalone, happily Henry features in the story. The characters are great, although they might make a bit more sense if you've read the ""Blood"" series, the writing and dialogue have all the humor I've come to expect from Huff. ""Summon the Keeper"" by her was one of the funniest books I've read. Unfortunately, what's missing here is a really good plot. Still, it's fun, light, camp and a great airplane book or diversion from mysteries."
2,Tony adventure not Henry,"It's hard to believe that this lame novel is written by the same author as the ""Blood Books"". When I read them, I stayed up all night to finish each one and when they ended I said, ""Why?"" The author must have heard that a lot and so these books were created to fill the request for more. However when I started reading this book I said, "" Why"", many times, except it meant, ""Why am I reading this?"" I made it through the middle of the book and looked at the ending and threw it in the recycling bin. I realize a vampire needs a day person to be effective on tracking whatever he's chasing, but Tony is more of a main character and a lame one I don't care about that kept me rooting for the shadows to win."
2,Not a Henry Fitzroy book,"I am a fan of Tanya Huff and the series of books with HEnry and Victoria. But this one is not it. While Henry is there he is such a minor character. The main character is Tony Foster a homosexual street kid who tanya should have left on the street. I was totally bored and read the book through because I was hoping it would get better, then i was happy when it was over. The plot idea was great, but it was not developed well and left me wanting for something more. I was expecting Henry to be a major player like he was with Victoria, but no, he is relegated to Tony's homosexual vampire lover who helps Tony out.Disappointing. Dull. I won't read the rest of this series, The Tony Foster series.Hey, Tanya, how about a series of Henry Fitzroy, I would read that."
3,If this is the first Huff you're considering.....,"Please start with the Victory Nelson series: Blood Price, etc. IMHO, this is series is Huff's best work.Tony Foster, the Point of View character from this series, has broken his ties with his vampire lover, Henry Fitzroy, and has gone to Vancouver to study film. He's landed a plum job as production assistant on an ""Angel-like"" televsion show.When one of the actresses ends up dead, Tony discovers his crew is in deep trouble. A ShadowLord has passed through a gate near the set and he's got to stop them---while he's keeping his job in showbiz.I probably would have rated this book higher if it was a new author and a new series, but this one's Tanya Huff and she's gotten off to something of a slow start here. ""Smoke and Mirrors"" the sequel, is coming out in June and I have a lot of hope it will be an improvement. Still, not a bad read. Just start with the books this one was spun off from first."
1,Definitely Not Huff's Best...,"This book is just poor.. the writing is tedious and pedestrian and the storyline is not even B-movie material. There's so many mentions of shadows that you want to just smash the book before its over with. I was looking for a fun light read but this was so light it nearly put me to sleep with boredom. Also the story doesn't really go anywhere for the longest time. No flair at all and it seems like she was just moving through the motions on this one.Stick with the Keeper books and Wizard of the Grove, these are much better."
4,Bootsy Gives up a Good disc here,"Bootsy&crew give up the full Music Dictinary here.Bootsy&Crew Rock&FUnk Out.Bootsy is very talented as Writer,Arranger,Producer,Instrumentalist&His VOcals ain't no Joke.this disc runs The Funk On Over Drive.Bootsy is a Musical Genius.He makes that Bass Talk."
5,How Bootsy Got His Groove On,"This was Bootsy's third successful effort on LP. It came at the height of his popularity when people were trying to capitalize on his sound (ie. Rick James, George Duke,...). Nearly every song is word perfect in terms of his style and execution. This CD is a must for any student of true funk music."
4,Great album and great CD,I wish all the albums from this era were put on CD. I am glad this one was.
4,Percolating funk from a master of funky bass,"The 3 tunes starting with ""Bootzilla"", a hard rocking funk workout, followed by ""Hollywood Squares"", a more laid back swinging funky groove, and then an absolute monster funk rave-up complete with cool keyboards blips and horn blasts and bleets, and Bootsy slapping and plucking the star-bass; they doin' it to death on ""Roto Rooter"". Check the vocals by Robert ""Peanut"" Johnson, they are hilarious."
4,good size,"not real small, the fairy it's self is aout the size of bottle cap and the detale is just whats shown. The face isn't over detaled but its still prity."
1,limited info- not useful,"no information on industry dynamics; mostly just a list of companies by SIC code, which is likely available free at a library. A waste of money."
3,Still good but...,"This is such a weird movie that I'm not sure if I like it or not. I think I do, but by a thin margin. Follow the rise and fall of a familiar musician through the eyes of a passionate fan."
3,Mediocre,"I never learned how to pay for college without going broke. Had some useful info, but hard to stay interested. Purchased Sallie Mae version of same info and liked it a lot better."
3,QUESTION,"Old French Fairy Tales (Paperback)by Comtesse De Segur (Author). 2004 ed. ISBN-10: 1410105695. Are all the illustrations by Virginia Sterrett or just the cover? And if so, how many illos? This books a bit pricey but I would definitely buy it depending on the interior illustrations. Thanks to any who can help."
5,If you like classic rock this is the one for you a must have,"You can't get enough of this band. They deserve to be in the rock and roll hall of fame in Cleveland ,Ohio!This album has to be the greatest.There's something for everyone here.I can't get over it.This is how music should still sound like.Thank you for this it makes my day!!!!!"
4,Good Music,"Like others, wasn't too happy to have to purchase entire CD(s) to get ""I Love You"" but also like others have said, it is nice to hear more of this band's music. All the songs are pleasant."
2,Newlyweds,"I purchased this set for my husband. He looked desperately for the song ""I love you"" to play at our wedding. He could never find just that song to download. So this was his Christmas present. Unfortunately, that is the only good song on the CD. Oh well."
4,pretty Spongeriffic,"Okay, here's what I have to say. If you like spongebob, and you find the songs from the show amusing....you'll want this. It's cute. Mine came with a big spongebob sticker inside as well. However, this cd is only 8 dollars, and here's the reason why. It's a very short cd. It's only about 9 minutes long. I liked it, but I wanted more for my money. And I KNOW there are more spongebob songs now! Hopefully nickelodeon will make a fuller compilation. But, its neat if you need background for a spongebob party for your kids, etc! =)"
3,more songs,what i realy wanted was the techno song they had in the ep where the jely fish invaded spoungebobs house.
5,SPONGEBOB ROCKS!!!!!!!!,"Like I said before SPONGEBOB ROCKS!!!!!! Ok now seriously, this CD is very cute and all the songs are really funny. I would buy this and I'm 16 yrs. old people!!! My sis also loves it and she's 11. So whether you're 9 or 90, if you like cartoons, then buy this adorable CD... or else Spongebob will kill you by driving you insane with his happy little voice! LOL j/k! ;)"
3,"Cute, but a tease...","Much too short; could have left out the heavy metal ""Jellyfishing"". It seemed out of place.My 6 year old daughter is actually afraid ofthe song, so we skip over it. I'm surprisedthat song from the episode where SpongeBob'shome is turned into a disco by jellyfish wasnot included. I hope that if a volume II is released,it isn't as short and that they will include thisparticular tune."
3,Where's The Rest?!?,"This CD was definetly not what I was expecting. The whole thing was only about 10 minutes long and they skipped most of the songs. Where is ""Sweet Victory"", ""Just a Greasy Spoon"", and ""Jellyfish Jam""? Or the Christmas song? The songs they put on there were cute but there weren't enough. :("
3,Where are the other songs?!?,I am the biggest fan of spongebob and im really upset that there is no Sweet Victory Song or Just a grill or The C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E SONG!!!!!!!! Why cant you play alll the song not just clips coz you miss out the best parts of the songs!!!!!!!
3,GO find somthing else to do kiddies,"oki bought this soundtrack like a maniac SOOOOO excited. I was dissapointed. Not only cuz there's barely anything the songs SUCK SOOOOOO MUCH CRAP.I mean, yeah those songs were good. In theory.The only song i could listen to for hours and hours was the Pantara song. I mean, u people are little wusses if u dont like that song. Its the BEEEEESSSSSTTTT. I can't belive nobody likes it. It was in spongebob for g0d;s sake.SO they put it in.Live with it.Overall if 9-16 years olds are listening to this, u should keep this just for pantara and go listen to heavy metal or rock or somthing liek that. I have some recomendations:Linkin Park, Pantara, Limp Bizcuit, Korn, Spineshank, Type O engative and Godsmack.But if u guys are listening to this get closer to the pantara song.You'll understand it ROX!!!!!!!"
2,"Great Stuff, But Where's The Rest?","I love the tracks on this CD, but the running time--9 minutes, 9 seconds, total--is a bad joke.CDs can safely run 70 minutes of music. The only reason I can see that this CD is cut criminally short is to put other tracks on a seperate CD come holiday shopping time.""Ripped Pants"" and ""F.U.N. Song"" are great, and you can't help but like the SBSP themesong.But the Pantera tune, in addition to being completely out of place, is absolute garbage. This is a band without an audience, and both my kids and I roll our eyes and hit the ""skip"" button whenever this klunker comes out of the speakers. My advice for future compilations would be to include the popular tunes that the characters actually sing, and leave the compilers favorite schlock tunes in their own cassette players, where they belong.My kids and I love Sponge Bob, but this is [not a good deal]."
1,Spongebob SCARES me!!,"First, it was Pokemon. Then, it was that horrible Hampton the Hampster that scared me. Now, it's Spongebob! Aaahhhhh! Now Pokemon doesn't seem so scary anymore. Please stop scaring me! Please go away!!! Can I please give this CD 0 stars?! 'Cause that's what it's worth! I can't STAND the show....please listen to some REAL music, kids. Not this trash!!"
1,"SUCKS, SUCKS, SUCKS!","This is the worst album ever and has the worst songs anyone could ever think of. This crud makes the littlest, tiniest babys hate it!!! Everybody, save a few bucks and tell your little kids NEVER!!!!!! Spongebob, even though I love your show, for this I want you to DIE!!!!!!!"
4,WHERE'S THE CHRISTMAS SONG?,"This CD was great, but the ""very 1st christmas to me"" isn't on here. Otherwise, I would give this a 5. Awesome! Buy it!"
5,ME WOVE SPONGEBOB,"Spongebob is THE BEST!!! I watch him every day and this CD is just another great addition. I sing the theme song every single day, and now I'm learning all the other great songs. This is my favorite CD in the WORLD!!!"
4,SpongeBob Squarepants: Original Theme Highlights [SOUNDTRA,Its good but there is not nearly enough.Where are the great hornpipes played on the concertina?
4,I'm ready!,"Yeah, it's short, and probably overpriced for it's shortness. But hey... it's SpongeBob! Fans of the absorbent, yellow, porous one should enjoy this. Since the track listing isn't there above, here it is for you: 1 - ""SpongeBob SquarePants Theme"" by Painty The Pirate and Kids, 2 - ""Loop de Loop"" by Ween, 3 - ""Texas Song"" by Sandy Cheeks (with Junior Brown), 4 - ""Pre-Hibernation"" by Pantera, 5 - ""Ripped Pants"" by SpongeBob and The Losers, 6 - ""F.U.N. Song"" by SpongeBob and Plankton, and 7 - ""SpongeBob ScaredyPants"" by The Ghastly Ones."
3,Could have been better!!!,"This is an excellent CD I love it, it is too short and leaves out ""Sweet Victory"", ""Living in the sunlight"", and many more!!!"
2,They forgot all the good songs!,"the songs that were on the cd were good and all, but hello! where were the good songs! the campfire song song wasnt on there and neither was the sweet victory one. i was very dissappointed. it wasnt like they ran out of room either. the cd is really short. like i said, very dissappointing."
4,Not bad at all...,It's okay but it misses the Krusty Krab pizza song and that would make it better. Also if it had a conversation between Sopongebob and Patrick made only for the c-d it would be like a collecters piece.
2,Less than 10 minutes??!!,"My kids and I love Spongebob, and most of the songs on the CD are great (my favorite is F.U.N. - Plankton kills me!). However, the CD clocks in a 9 minutes and 13 seconds making it a complete rip-off considering there were other songs they could have included.I also question the inclusion of a Pantera tune in the middle of a kid's CD... if this is a kid's CD, that is."
4,Sweet but short,"My only complaint is that the cd does not include the special promo theme the violent femmes did for a spongebob commercial. Otherwise, it is a perky little disc."
3,Didn't notice any difference,"Didn't notice any difference in my dog's health using this product. The dosing isn't exactly easy to understand, and these stuck really badly to the inside of my dog's mouth. So, when we thought we had stuck it down his throat, we usually found the pellets on the floor later."
2,disappointing,"I was very excited when i got this watch. stylish and recieved a lot of compliments. But after six months, the watch strap broke off and apparently the ""warranty"" doesn't cover the strap, the face, anything! i would need to pay around 40 dollars to fix it plus the shipping. I was very disappointed."
3,Disappointed with quality,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter's boyfriend. I specifically purchased this because of the toolbox the tools came in. That was a big mistake. Getting ready to wrap the present, I realized there were cracked pieces of plastic coming from the hinges, so I had to go out and buy a new toolbox to hold the tools. The tools seem to be decent, so I did give him the set with the new toolbox which added to my expense."
3,Small adjustable wrench,"The tool kit seems really complete, but don't expect to be able to use the adjustable wrench to change a shower head-- the 6"" adjustable wrench's mouth is too small to fit around the standard sized shower head bolt. I bought this kit with the express purpose of getting a one with an adjustable wrench to change my shower head in my new apartment (and to have some other hand tools to help with hanging pictures and performing some fix up jobs)-- unfortunately it let me down big time."
3,It's ok,"Its not really worth having. The tool box is very small and you have to arrange the tool in a specific order otherwise you cant close it. The toolbox and tools are very cheap. Get a good set of craftsman, they will be worth the money."
3,much smaller than expected,bought this as a took kit for my recently divorced daughter....expected more variety of tools.... would have paid more to get more. was a bit disappointed.. pretty box doesn't help fix anything
2,The Everly Brothers Deserve Better,"The Everly Brothers have been on my best-loved list since the late 50s and I thoroughly enjoyed the VHS version of their heralded Reunion Concert. I couldn't wait for the new DVD technology to catch up with this great show. Upon watching this DVD version for the first time I can only express my disappointment in the sound and picture quality. The Everly Brothers were in A-1 form, their British fans pretty much sat on their hands, and the sound and picture quality were awful. Don't waste your money on the DVD -- buy the VHS version and ENJOY!!!"
2,A Soulless Disappointment,"I bought the DVD sight unseen for a friend adding a copy for myself. It was good seeing the Everly Brothers performing together again. They brought their tuxes. They brought their Guitars. They forgot to bring their souls. Don and Phil Everly clunked their way mechanically through all their great hits. The performance was better than simply mediocre. But the SOUL, that thing that animates a performance and brings life to it and makes it true art, was missing. I am old enough to have seen the Everly Brothers perform live and on television giving far more animated and engaged performances than their ""Reunion Concert"" in Royal Albert Hall. The magic is gone; probably forever. It is a tragic loss to music, to the Everly Brothers fans and to those of us who came up during this exciting period of musical change.Thank you!"
2,Shortchanged again!,"For anybody familar with this material it's unfortunate that we've been shortchanged quite a few times now on severel CD releases.It wasn't until 1999 (fifteen years after the original show!) that we finally saw a double CD release of ""The Complete Reunion Concert"" featuring the material of the show in its entirety (25 tracks in all).Looking at this DVD (and its 20 tracks) I am just wondering if this release simply follows that same ""practice"" so firmly established by the music industry today?It's just mind-boggling that with a format like DVD (which virtually provides no limitations in its art form) they were not able to get it right from the start!They have all the material, state-of-the art sound and still they decide to cut out half an hour out of the original show?"
3,Here are the songs on the dvd,"Many of the other reviews here are helpful in evaluating the quality of the show, but no one bothered to list the songs performed. Here they are:(Note: for some reason, I can't get the listing to have a separate, neat column for time. I tried.)Title TimeClaudette 2:25Walk Right Back 2:52Crying in the Rain 3:20Cathy's Clown 2:24Love Is Strange 4:05When Will I Be Loved 2:40So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad) 3:00Bird Dog 2:08Be Bop a Lula 2:59Barbara Allen 1:15Long Time Gone 1:55Step It Up and Go 1:05Bye Bye Love 2:24Wake Up Little Suzie 2:06Devoted to You 2:45Love Hurts 2:35('Til) I Kissed You 2:35All I Have to Do Is Dream 3:07Lucille 2:21Let It Be Me 3:28"
4,"Fun for kids, good info for enthusiasts","My 4-year-old could watch this video twice a day if I let him. It's about restored steam trains in Australia, and dates back to 1988. That aside, it's fun for him to watch and there is enough technical information to satisfy train enthusiasts, too. It covers several different types of trains (J class, R class, T class, etc.) and shows the trains running through the australian countryside, as well as being tended to by the men who work on them. We have this as part of a two-video set, the other being about when the Flying Scotsman was shipped to Australia for a celebration of steam trains in that country."
4,"Thalia ""Mundo de Cistal""","""Mundo de Cristal"", originally released in 1991 is one of the best albums of Thalia. Among the favorite songs are: ""Mundo de Cristal,"" ""En la Intimidad"" and ""El Bombo De Tu Corazon."" Essential for fans and recommended for those who appreciate the work of the beautiful Mexican singer."
3,Another independent film about sex-obsessed yuppies,"Three couples react with shock to an author's cynical comments about monogamy, and then go out and prove him right, for the most part. This is a slightly better-than-average contribution to the genre of low-budget films consisting of lots of talk punctuated with a few sex scenes. As expected, it's populated with unknowns and TV actors (Jason Alexander of ""Seinfield"" and Amy Yasbeck of ""Wings"", among others). A particularly raunchy sequence features Hudson Leick (best known as Callisto, archfoe of Xena, Warrior Princess), and perhaps that will be enough to give this film a certain cult appeal. Certain cliches of this genre are used repeatedly - dream sequences, quirky secondary characters, and hostile first meetings that quickly lead to the bedroom. Despite the cookie-cutter format and the lack of any really new ideas, this movie was funny and/or sexy just often enough for me to have enjoyed watching it."
3,Something About Relationships,This is a fun little movie but nothing spectacular. It's a standard movie about the diffrent types of relationships and the levels of sexual freedom in those diffrent types. I enjoyed the many diffrent opinions and views of these relationships. And the amazing and very HOT scene with a favorite actress of mine Hudson Liek! Who has been a favorite of mine since her Calisto days and has shown her great acting skills in a number of movies but is clearly not recognized for her talents. But Hudson aside the movie is worth watching on boring Saturday night for a few hot scenes and a lot of bouncing around from one couple to the next.
4,Great movie... but,Actually no buts about it. It is a delightfully fun movie with broad appeal. It has no lol moments but will keep you more or less constantly amused.But... The truth is. Even though she is not on the cover. A large % of its sales are going to be directly related to Hudson Leick's sex scene.
5,Incredibly moving story,It's been a long time since a book moved me. HEIR TO GOVANDHARA did just that. It grabbed me and kept my emotions on high. I also had about twenty questions that I emailed Sara Ramastry and she answered every single one. Most authors don't do that.
5,It Rings my Bells......................Nice Doorbell.,"I live in an apartment building and the bell to my apartment was not working properly, so I bought this and It works just fine.The only downside to it is, that it has different melodies that you can choose which is fine for me, but the button to change the melodies is on the doorbell ringer on the outside, which means anyone on the outside who is ringing the bell can change the melody.But other than that. I like it."
5,Gadjo Dilo- a rare gem.,"Like the previous reviewers, I had trouble finding this film on video, finally locating it through Foreignfilms.com's message board. The film gives us a peek into gypsy life- raw, gritty and uncompromising. It is also an achingly beautiful romance- in the true sense of the word. Coupled with the fine music score, it has a viseral quality that in the end leaves you a little giddy and grateful to people like Tony Gatlif for making movies like this."
2,French guy gets stuck in Gypsy village,"Having enjoyed the music and patient non-narrative pacing of Latcho Drom, my friends and I tracked down this other Gypsy-themed film by the same director, Tony Gatlif. Unfortunately this one has far less of the sublime music and tries to tell a story. A young Parisian fellow travels to Romania to find a favorite Gypsy singer of his late father's. He enters a Romany (Gypsy) village and is unable to leave, though I can't imagine why. All the residents do is complain and curse in incredibly foul expletives. Any child old enough to read should not be allowed to watch this endless barrage of foul profanity. If a child is too young to read the subtitles then it would be ok since the dialogue is in Romanes, French, and Romanian. The only redeeming feature of this film, other than the occasional musical moments, is the opportunity to view the life of an oft-ignored culture, but this film is a wholly unpleasant experience."
3,With and without the romance,"Since I do not know much about the Gypsies or the Roma, I cannot say whether this movie gives a realistic idea of the gypsies' life, but it does show, how to become friends with somebody wild and free. It also shows a woman with all those qualities and more. The crude language in the sex scene shocked me a little too, but I figured this was done on purpose. What with acting like a wild untamed animal the very first time he tries to touch her at all?I enjoyed it, and found it truly unique as a movie. There are some beautiful dance scenes in there, and the music is not what you know from ""Zigeunerweisen"" or Hungarian Gypsies, it sounds Oriental. The end brings the story to full circle."
5,The Heat Is On And I'm SWEATING!!!,"Ammong peers such as James Brown,Rufus Thomas,Stevie Wonderand the many arcitectsof funk the Isley's HAVE IT!!Of course""Fight The Power"" is a monster jam no matter how you cut it-lyrically it holds nothing back and musically it JAMS!!!The titaltrack doesn't change a thing while ""Hope You Feel Better Love""adds alot of melody into the groove.Side B is a ""Let's Get It On""-styled bedroom suite-three Wonder-like synthesized slow,sexygrooves like ""For The Love Of You"",""Make Me Say It Again Girl""and the fabulous ""Sensuality"" which NEVER fails to get me going.Let me put it this way-I first heard this during a massive icestorm in Maine in 1998 and not only did it melt the ice for mebut in the end I was SWIMMING in it.This record is truly HOT!!!!!"
1,i wanted fight the power 12 in version,i was looking for a version of fight the power live version so can you help mefind fight power 12 in version
5,Gr8!,This is a wonderful CD for Isley Brothers fans. Transaction went very smoothly and I received it in a very timely manner.
4,The Heat Is On,This is a great record. I don't know why I don't already have it. I loved the Isley Brothers. Very Funky.
4,good for the price,"I really like these, however I have an issue with one side, it never wants to stay one. O'well. Good sound quality and I have not had an issue with anyone being able to hear my music."
4,Almost great.........,"This book has its good points and bad points.Good points- The number of monsters-over 500!!! There are so many here.The templates are wonderful. Liches, Fiends, Half Dragons, Vampires: its all great!The artwork is incredible. All the pictures are very well done.Bad points- After looking at some of the older monster manuals, I noticed that this one seems to have a lack of information about each monster.Some things could have been more clear too....Overall, if you plan to be a dnd dungeon master, buy this book. However, you WILL need the players handbook and DM's guide to use it to its full potential."
5,How could any AD&D fanatic NOT be crazy about this one!?,"I am from the old school of AD&D, having started playing back in the early 1980's. The 1st Edition Monster Manual from back then rates as a COLORING BOOK, compared to this new edition! The color illustrations are PHENOMINAL, the text - comprehensive and enjoyable to read, the book's overall quality - SUPERB! My mouth was watering as I flipped through the pages. I was careful not to bring it to work with me today, so not to get completely absorbed in fantasy and not in my work. If you love AD&D and don't have this book yet - trust me - GET IT! BRAVO, you writers, llustrators, and publishers that brought us this one!!!"
3,It could have more monsters and info...,"This is the third book of rules for D&D 3ed. It is the last complement for creating adventures suggested in the Dungeon Master Manual (core rulebook II).I think most of the creatures are too powerful, so you can't use them in low level adventures. The number of monsters is Ok, but more could be added.The art is not as impressive as I expected, it could be better, sometimes is comic style (of the low-budget ones), or very impressive (minotaur), but in general lacks of uniformity (I think is the right word).The information in general is good.I suggest this book just as a start, then you can create your own creatures based on those included in this book."
2,Waste of Time,"Okay, I've been playing AD&D and D&D since I could read. I've read every edition, and this has GOT to be the worst possible job ever.First, was it necessary to use the words ""hideous"", ""cunning"", and ""vicious"" in almost every entry?Second, the author (Skip Wiliams) coughed up very little new material. Most of the entries are the same creatures available in the older editions. Any DM can modify their old rules without wasting another $20.00 on this thing.If you've never played before or don't own a REAL Monster Manual or Compendium, it might be worth it. If you own the older ones, just make a few modifications and save some cash."
1,I Now Know,"I know why the Githzeri, the Leucrotta, and all the other monsters from the old Moster Manual weren't included here: WotC decided to place only the most common, the most simple monsters here and spread the other all-stars to the Psion's Handbook, Monsters of Faerun, the upcoming Monster manual 2, and various others (the dracolich appears in Pool of Radience adventure).I'm not so obtuse as to not grasp the notion that to play d&d; you need opponents, and this is a nessesary evil. But the book's monsters are practically stat blocks with only a paragraph or two to decribe ecology, habitats, culture, motivations, etc. The whole effect is a only cosmetic difference between a goblin and a kobold. This is Cynicism at its worst: the book doesnt care about the monsters exept as punching bags and Piñatas. This is what any decent roleplayer like myself despises about these books."
3,This is good for the less creative D&D player..,"This is a great book for those D&D players who want to go really by the book and not take the time to create their own monsters. That is something I love to do. But if you want to skip the trouble, this book is the one for you. It has well over 100 pages of monsters ranging from small to giant, undead to very much alive and faires to dragons. This is a good book and even though I hate to admit it should be part of all the D&D basic items and gear."
2,Monster Manual 3e,"Of all the books in D&D, I love the monster manuals the most. But unfortunatly this book is a BIG disapointment. If you compare it to the 2nd Edition Monsterous Manual the first thing you notice is size, 3e is half the size of 2e and that means half the monsters. Many of the basic monsters of D&D are missing from this book and the new beasts don't measure up to the old ones. The second thing you will notice is how easy the 2e book is to read. All the enteries are uniform, one to a page, not scattered over multiple pages as most of the 3e monsters are. Also, some of the artwork in the 3e book is just plain awful. If you are new to D&D and want some good monsters check out the Creature Collection from Swords & Sorcery Studios. The book is in 3e format, has lots of great new creatures(and new ways of using old monsters) and is professionally put together."
5,Ah the joys,"Always wanted a monster manual for my good old, apparently broken 3.0 books. Now I have one :-). It rocks."
5,Monster Manual,Ordered for a friend for Christmas. It was one that he was missing and he was glad to get a new copy. Thank you.
5,Best Monster Manal Yet!,"Do your players think the monsters are too easy to defeat? When you start rolling out the monsters in this book they will think that no longer! Red dragons, for example, can now have 660 hit points and higher! Their armor class can climb to 46 (equal to -26 in the old rule system). Giants have been given a boost in hit dice as well (and multiple attacks).The best feature, I think, is the ability to make each and every monster more powerful, as needed by your campaign. An orc, for example, could be given 12 extra hit dice, if needed.Play the game which inspired me to become an author!"
5,You simply can't do without it,"Okay, It's a book of monsters, which you need to play the game. To write a review of the book is to write a review of the entire game. I would like to point out a hidden resource in this game. If you have some new players in the game, especially if they are new to the whole D20 system, you can have them play as monsters for a session. This lets them get used to the different statistics, how combat works, etc."
4,"Great Resource, but a little late","This is the final instalment of the Core Rule Books, and any one who wants to experiance D&D to the max sould buy this book. The types of the monsters are varied, giving great quest options to the DM. There are a great deal of the old creatures still there, but each with a little change from the previous edition. The new monsters are interesting and give a great variety to play against. Some of the monster also have rules to create monster classes, a great thing for a Goblin NPC and such. The pictures are detalied and paired with the info you can vividly describe the campaign to your players. Overall, a great book, but why in the world was it not released 1 or 2 months earlier??"
4,Above Average,"I completely agree with the gentleman from Madison, WI. If you're going to base your purchase on these reviews, do yourself a favor and read ""Let the Games Begin"" by Haggarddm which you can find below. Just to sum up; You need this book if you are planning on playing 3rd ed, the format is annoying (monsters crammed in with a shoehorn), the rules are fresh, the art is the best it has ever been in a previous Monster book by at least 10-fold (muah!). But shouldn't there be rules included to convert 2nd ed monsters to the new system? (I run an Oriental campaign and I need my Kara-Tur creatures updated) Also, a blank monster template for photo-copying and creating your own monsters would have been a nice bonus. Oh well, coulda, shoulda, woulda. It's not going to change, and it's well worth more than 20 bucks so I'll stop moaning and groaning and let you get on with your purchase."
5,Almost worth it just for the artwork,"I've only ever played D&D intermittently and would never actually make a good DM, so, apart from just buying this book to know what to expect as a player, I also wanted to see what the artwork had to offer. I wasn't dissappointed. The illustrations of creatures, though of various styles, are consistently good to great throughout, and very rarely bordering on mediocre, which I think noteworthy because I have very high standards when it comes to fantasy artwork. The book also get points also for font styles and presentation. I'm tempted to substract a star since the book isn't always specific when it comes to a creature's size but it's really a small point, not a star."
3,"The Worst of the New Lot, Not That I Mean That in a Bad Way","Don't get me wrong, this is a good book, with some really good ideas. However the new Monster Manual has some glaring oversites, that really make it annoying. Some of my personal favorate monsters are missing. Gem Dragons, Faerie Dragons, Thri-kreen, Gremlins, and some other ""classic"" monsters. All in all it is telling me (in a booming voice) ""Be prepaired for the Monster Manual 2."" Beyond that they have redesigned some monsters from the ground up. The most obvious being the Harpy, but some others have been tweaked as well. It is one of those ""required"" books, and it is a must buy. But it is the weakest in what has been a very execptional 3rd Edition of D&D."
4,"Great, but could be better","Not up to the 5 stars of the first two core books (PHB and DMG), but still very good. Monsters now have stats like characters do, so you can tell how strong a Great wrym gold dragon is (it's 45!). The layout is a bit cluttered, something that is actually a step down from 2nd Ed."
1,good,This caddy replaces the one that broke. It is a valuable piece of equipment for my husband's business.
5,Coat Caddy is a lifesaver,"This product I wasn't able to find in stores but my husband needed one for his car. He's a professional that wears a suit every day. It's durable, simple to install or remove and holds his winter dress coat or suit coats with ease. Actually ordered a second for his car so his business partner would be able to use one if they were driving together. A must have for professionals!!!"
3,Works,"The product works as advertised, delivery was a bit slow. However, I drive a two door ford focus and that really does not provide much room for the coat caddy to operate. I believe the coat caddy would work better in a four door car."
5,great idea for frequent travelers,got this for my brother who does sales calls for his job. he said that it was simple to install & that it works great & loves the chrome (as opposed to the more expensive wooden ones) because it matches the interior of his car. overall a great product at a great price!
2,Not a too much technical literature,"When I decided to purchase this book , I was looking for a technical one , where I could learn about system characteristics , how does it work , installation , maintenance , etc. Chapter 6 , for example , has a lot of menu descriptions .Chapter 8 has around 40 pages describing DSS available programing.Those information are more suitable for the owner manual . This book is not updated , it mentions service providers that don't exist any more.Repeated information appears in different chapters ."
2,Out of date info,"I should have paid attention to the date of publication as there was no info on triple-head multi-satellite LNB dish reflectors. The book has some useful information but mostly, it is a hodge-podge of fact sheets and PR photos from manufacturers. Not worth the money."
3,A Bossa Nova album,"This album is more bossa nova than pop. I actually preferred June and their first album because their sound was more pop than jazz. It's good if you like bossa nova but it's not anything as interesting as ""Katydids"" or ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"",or ""Mood Swinging"". I was disappointed but I'll check out their other stuff."
4,Must Read for Generation X'ers,"For those of us in college during the Gulf War, this is a must read book. It brought back a lot of memories for me, some I wish it hadn't. I enjoyed reading about Elliot's journey through school and all the influencing elements presented to him. Some of the characters really reminded me of some of my college housemates. It was fun."
5,Out of It,Under the circumstances that the writer / author was newly recovered from the throes of seven months of a severe mental illness...I would say the book was extremely well written.
1,Don't buy,"Badly needs an editor. Mistakes like ""nice cream"" for ""ice cream"" and nearly every use of the possessive pronoun ""its"" is spelled with an apostrophe."
4,good.,This is an item I wanted for a research project and I am very glad to get it. It arrived as advertised and in a shorter time than estimated. Thank you very much!
5,Immersive beauty....,"Yeah, some people will dig this and some people won't... It's slow, ethereal, occasionally drifting and occasionally stirring... If you can lean back and let a sensual experience fill your senses, then you will enjoy this mightily. If you require more content and substance, it won't be so much your thing.The Eno interview footage is regrettable sparse (though the limited amount of it is very enlightening, and the ""punch line"" at the end is quietly hilarious), but the sensual content is extraordinary, so if you go in knowing what to expect, perhaps you will appreciate it for exactly what it is.For the record, I think the final shot of the sun setting over the water, with the horizon vanishing between the sun and its own reflection, is perhaps the most beautiful scene I have ever witnessed on film. They definitely saved the best for last in a film rife with both tranquil and striking imagery."
4,satisfied,The book arrived on time and it was a good read. I enjoyed reading this book it gives a different perspective.
5,"Rude boy, rude girl listen up!","One of the coolest bands from the second ska generation, The Selecter, is a must have for serious music collectors. This collection leaves you wanting more."
5,HuGE,I just want you to know that....this thing is HUGE. It's the size of my hand and built to last...forever.
3,Not Nez,"Interesting book, but it is just compiled interviews and nothing really new.It's okay to get a basic feel for Mike, but it would be better if we had a true autobiography."
1,not well written,This book is written by someone with basic understanding of jr high english! We'd be better off reading the old Tiger Beats and 16 Magazines for more indepth information on Nez....
3,It was good for what it was.,"For not having any input from the man himself, I would say that it was a pretty decent book. You can say what you want about Nesmith himself, but I think the author did about as good of a job as she could with what she had to work with. It was worth the kindle purchase."
5,Interesting Story,Liked the book very much. It was interesting to see what happened to him after he left the Monkees.
4,NOT BAD,"URBAN LEGEND WAS NOT THAT BAD. I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS KIND OF LIKE I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, BUT STILL IT'S GOOD. SOME OF THE DEATH SCENES ARE CREATIVE AND THE KILLER IS A BIG SHOCKER! I ALSO LIKE THAT THE KILLER USES AN AXE FOR THEIR MAIN WEAPON. PRETTY COOL MOVIE. IT KEPT ME IN SUSPENSE AND GUESSING AND GUESSING WHO THE KILLER IS!"
4,Excellent Movie!!,"Urban Legend was a very good flick!! It kept the action coming and you the viewer guessing. The killer's costume was ""OFF THE HOOK"" plain but, yet still scary as hell. I give this movie thumbs up!!! There aren't too many good scary movies these days but, this is no doubt one that represents!!!"
2,A real disappointment,"I liked the cast in this movie and films like this are sometimes real guilty pleasures for me but this particular one was a real let-down. It just wasn't interesting, scary or funny. A cast like this could thrive with better material. Better luck next time."
5,Urban Legends between the lines,You have to see this movie. I mean the part where Josh Jackson the hottie gets the rope so original. I was so surprised to see who the killer was. I would never have thought. I movie is a genuine original thriller. It keeps you awake and you dont fall asleep like most movie that just run-on and on. I plot is really cool and Urban Legend based killer with a ecskimo suit were do they think this stuff up? I have to say I was surprised. You gotta see it.
1,RIDICULOUS !!!!,"GOd, what a bad ""horror"" movie. It has all the cliches, a ridiculous ""climax"", bad actors all over the place, a normal female killer that has the strength of a man - a totally deceiving ending .. Horrible. I hope they don't make a sequel to this garbage."
1,A Waste of Time,"This movie is terrible with a truly horrible ending. There isn't one part in the whole movie that had me scared in the least bit. Most parts are so predictible it's sickening. The acting is awful, it moves at a snail's pace, and the killer isn't believable at all. There is no way that the killer would've been able to pull off what they did. After SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, this movie was really uncalled for. The first scene gave you hope for a half-way decent flick, but that didn't happen. If you want my advice, don't waste your time or money on this."
3,it looked good on paper.,well this is probably the worst of all the teen slasher films but still okay.scream and i know what you did last summer are better. the storyline gets you hooked and the acting isnt all that bad. the ending wasnt a five star one but it kept it interesting. the killer was a big suprise. but they shouldnt make the killer the hottest girl in the movie.
3,lame,"Now, the trailer for this movie made it look pretty good. But it hid the fact that this movie was a complete RIP OFF. First of all, i'm ok if someone gets inluenced by a movie and turns a scene into their own in a way that we wouldn't even recognize it. But with this movie, it was just too obvious. They just copied what had success. Some of the rip offs include: The killer calling someone during a party, changing the voice (scream), a bloody message written on the wall (i know what you did last summer), the fact that the viewer guesses the killer (scream), and teens as main characters (almost every 90's horror movie).Also, it's rare that I say this, but I just really didn't care about the characters. I, myself, am a screenwriter hopeful, and I swear to God, I always tell myself that my biggest fear is making a really amateurish horror movie, like Urban Legend.They just tried to hard."
3,Just-okay horror flick but cool concept,"Urban Legend is an okay horror-flick. For the late '90s, it is quite good compared to some of the other genre pieces, but had it emerged between, say 1972 and 1982 (a 10-year period which was probably the absolute golden age of horror) it would have died a death quite quickly. The concept, of course, is cool--a serial killer based on ""urban legends,"" those stories we have always taken for granted to be true (eg pop rocks plus Pepsi will kill you; the ""headlights game,"" etc), but having this kind of stuff happen on a college campus has become kind of a cliche in itself, and some of the actors were kind of second-stringers. Some cool moments abound, and the very ending was kind of cool if also cliched in retrospect. Overall, a harmless movie to rent, but not a deathless classic."
4,Not as violent as I thought it would be,"This movie was definately not as violent as I had first thought it would be. It wasn't graphic violence that was in the film, unlike that of movies where you see them being killed up close like the 'Scream Trilogy' (although those were wicked films). I thought this movie had an excellent storyline to it that was very original. Someone killing others through the means of 'Urban Legends'. I shall not reveal who is the killer but let you see for yourself........ Don't Get Scared Now!"
2,blah,not being much of a fan of slasher movies i saw this at a friends house and thought that it would be a hoot to try it out........oh god!!!! big mistake.......as others have said.....mega cliched storyline and characters that seem to annoying to live(thank god that they don't).Lame acting and trash in general. don't buy it....stay away..........
3,"A unique and mostly entertaining horror film, but not","exactly Event Horizon... This movie has the standard contrived plot common to all but the very best of the genre. The only twist is that all of the killings in this movie are done based on cheesy urban legends. Rebecca Gayheart plays a convincing gullible friend/psychopath, and the other actors & actresses play their parts well, even that guy from the abhorrent Dawson's Creek. Overall, this is not the best horror film out there, but it is a good way to spend an hour and a half."
2,"Dumb, but has its moments","Mostly, I'm just glad I didn't pay money to see this movie at the theater. That the killer based the murders on urban legends was interesting, but I didn't buy the identity of the murdering psycho. The killer would have had to move at the speed of light to get to all of the people who were killed, AND have superhuman strength. And the animal cruelty was really disturbing. And I'm not just talking about the terrier's fate. Its stupid owner pierced its nose and forced it to drink alcohol. Yeah, that's really funny. On the positive side of the movie, Robert Englund was great as a suspicious professor, and the female campus cop with delusions of grandeur provided some comic relief. Mostly though, this movie sucked. The only scary moments were in the very beginning--the gas station scene. I got a few chills from that one. Anyway, if you want to see this movie, wait until it isn't categorized as a new release and save your money."
4,great movie,"First was Scream, then I Know What You Did Last Summer, then Halloween: H20, followed by The Faculty, and now...Urban Legend. Sporting a cool cast and actual scariness and plot, Urban Legend is a great movie, not as good as Scream but better then I Still Know and other lesser horror flicks."
4,Quite scary!,"A killer is killing students on a college campus by copying urban legends.If you know a lot about urban legends, this movie will get you re-familiarized with them. Unfortunately, if you are very familiar with urban legends, the outcome of each killing is sometimes predictable. A small role by Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund, and some good acting by Alicia Witt and Rebecca Grayheart makes this a watchable movie."
5,Thrills Spills Chills!,"a college student starts to see that the murders around her are the murders of a Crazed,Psyc-out Urban Legend killer. Her friends start to drop dead on the spot. Then the fun starts.... This movie has the coolest killings! The plot,people,and murders are so real. You'll love this movie if you love 70s,& 80s slasher movies."
4,"GET OFF THE ""SCREAM"" RIPOFF KICK AND JUST CHECK IT OUT!","The only--and I do mean ONLY--reason Urban Legend was trashed so much in reviews was because it came along in the wake of Scream, and was thus accused of being a ripoff. But forget for a moment that Scream exists, and this movie has more than enough power to stand on its own. An Urban-Legend serial killer? Brilliant! Only complaints--the killer's jacket lending him/her an absurd resemblance to a grownup Kenny McCormick, and a rather implausible, contrived ending."

1,12-year-old girls everywhere rejoice!,"...Because you're the only one's who'll think it's any good. A few tense moments don't make up for some of the worst writing and acting I've ever seen. Question: Why did so many people happen to A.) Own the same coat and B.) wear it with the hood up in hot weather? That's just dumb. And what's the deal with Gayheart's ""psycho"" acting all of a sudden at the end? Sure, the character was ""psycho"", but a piece of dancing feces could have done a less unintentionally-funny job. Don't waste your time on this garbage. Go rent the best: Scream. Try to cram it in your schedule between Dawson's Creek and Wasteland. Heh."
3,Urban Legend,"I saw this movie years ago and for some reason, I wanted to watch it again recently. I love urban legends and horror movies so this movie could do no wrong-yea right. This is a typical late 90's teen horror movie with teenage stars who were hot at the time and basically faded within a year or two. Rooert Englund did a decent job as the professor. The death scenes were creative in the way they were all part of urban legends-duh. Overall, decent but nothing stands out."
2,Poor Very Poor,"This film could and should have been so much better. The cast was poorly selected apart from Jared Leto who was okay, but hey everyone's got to start everywhere! So it's come to this a film that relies on a Josh Jackson cameo role (oh and Oceans 11 could have lived withour him)!"
2,Such a waste,"Alicia Witt is one of the best actresses alive today. If you can find copies of some of her more obscure works, such as Fun and especially Hotel Room, I strongly encourage you to check them out. However, she displays absolutely none of her huge talent in this predictable mess of a horror movie. Nobody else does, either. When Robert Englund turns in the best performance in a movie, in what was basically a joke cameo, what does that say? The direction was big on fake scares and people jumping out of the dark while the music blasts, and short on suspense or ingenuity. The killer's identity and motive is ridiculous beyond words. The plot holes are legion; over and over again, things happen which simply can't occur in real life (like covering up all those murders). All we're left with is just another Scream clone."
1,"Hello! Pretty people, who can't act, having a bit of fun...","Hello!!! Pretty people, who can't act, having a bit of fun thats all the movie was. It was not a thriller, or horror or even close to a comedy. Better than scream, good for a laugh, but lame!!"
1,Worst Movie EVER!!!!!!!,"I gave ""Urban Legend"" an F-. This was the worst horror movie I have ever seen!! I mean, come on people, who would walk around in a snow suit at the end of April?? Also, the part about the dog was just plain cruel!! I think they should have spent a lot more time on production!! Alicia Witt and Jared Leto really need some acting classes!! One more thing, that female killer could not perform those kinds of attacks on certain victims, like Joshua Jackson. A good idea for a film was wasted here!!"
1,WHAT THE ..?!?!,"THIS MOVIE IS GOOD FOR ONLY TWO SCENES : THE OPENING GAS STATION SCENE, AND THE SCENE WHERE THE GUY IS HANGING FROM A TREE BY A ROPE. THATS IT .. NOT WORTH BUYING FOR ANY OTHER REASON....EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A LAXITIVE. IT GET 3 STARS FOR THE TWO SCENES, 5 FOR THE LATTER."
4,"THE TITLE IS URBAN LEGEND,","AND THAT'S HOW YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO THINK GOING INTO THIS MOVIE, IT IS AN URBAN LEGEND HANDED DOWN FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL, TEEN TO TEEN AND SO ON AND SO ON. I THINK IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE. ALICIA WITT WAS VERY GOOD IN THIS MOVIE. AND SO WAS REBECCA GAYHEART. IT WAS A FUN, SLIGHTLY SCARY MOVIE. I MUST ADMIT SOME PARTS ARE CORNY AND JUST DON'T CLICK, BUT GOING BACK TO THE TITLE THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO."
2,Cable viewing only,"While not flat-out 'bad', Urban Legend really ammounts to nothing more then an untimately unfulfilling 'Scream' clone. It has it's moments, there are scenes where UL is at least trying to be clever. That's about the nicest thing I can say about it though.Unless you know someone actually in the movie, I can't possibly reccommend buying a copy. However, you could catch it on cable without feeling like you've been cheated."
5,One of my favorite slashers!,"!Heather's Teenage Son!The reason for this being oen of my favorite slashers is the original concept that is uses: The deaths happen based on an urban legend. This different concept & plot makes this film a fresh & stylish horror film, and also make it quite entertaining! However, it's sequel falls short of the suspence the original had and just plain sucks anyway, but part one is great! I reccomend it highly..."
1,eh,"I saw this movie on TV the other day and, honestly, the movie has potential to be a kinda good scary movie but the low mentality of these students that we were supposed to believe were in college shocked me. I've known 5th graders that are more intelligent than the young adults portrayed in this movie!"
1,Horrible....please save your money for something else,If there was a rating of no/negative stars this film definately desreves it. The slasher movie genre has returned and like it's hey day in the late 70's and mid 80's it's grtting tiring.The plot has the depth of a cheap porno with a cast of nobodys and never will be.
2,creepy,"Will make the viewer afraid to drive at night. With scary students and whacked-out killer that is a mild surprise. Not a movie for the faint of heart, but for the weak-brained. Will regret seeing this film."
3,Pretty Good For A Horror Flick,"This is a really good horror movie because the it's hard to point of the ""bad-guy"" until the very end."
3,URBAN LEGEND,I found this movie better than most as far as slasher movies go. The acting wasn't all that hammy and it had some suspenseful moments.
4,legends that kick ass,this was cool. a killer hackin off people by urban legends..........how original. great slasher movie one of the better ones. and tara reid in it!!!!!
2,Completely and totally mediocre in every sense of the word.,"The string of teen horror flicks was revived with the wonderful Scream. It was then followed up with I Know What You Did Last Summer. Then along comes Urban Legend. This film takes everything you learned from Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and turns it into the completely predictable piece of film trash. You can figure out who the villain is, who he/she will kill and even how they are gonna bite it. The film is okay to watch if you are a fan of horror, but do not expect Halloween standards. The only thing good about this film were that a few of the scenes were inventive, but still predictable. Don't see this film, watch Scream instead."
2,"Great opening, goes downhill afterward.","Alicia Witt is a college student investigating murders that seem to be based on urban legends. Interesting premise begins very well, with a tense opening sequence that actually provides some good chills, but goes downhill with repetitive stupidity, annoying characters, and the revelation of the killer and his/her motives is ludicrously bad."
2,Ripoff!,"I thought this movie would be awesome because I knew all those scary stories, and loved them. Unfortunately, Urban Legend's writer doesn't know the meaning of the word ""originality."" This movie copied off of Scream. At the frat party, the character, Parker, gets a call from the killer on the phone. Of course, the killer is using a voice changer, just like in Scream. Did the writer actually think people would find that scary or original? I think he was too wrapped up in being on the horror bandwagon that he failed to come up with something original."
4,Awesome!,"I really enjoyed this movie. From the moment the gas station guy yells at this girl, ""There's someone in the back seat! "", my full attention was given to this movie. The story line is what makes this movie a smash. I am fascinated by serial killers for some reason and even a dumb movie like ""Serial Mom"" appeals to me. I never knew what an urban legend was until I saw this movie, and now I know what to call them. I heard of a few of the legends before and it really excited me to try and discover which legend the killer would use next and who would be the next victim. A must see action-packed thriller!"
3,"Okay, don't listen to the rest of the people, just me!","Ok, the other don't know what there saying. If you are going to buy this movie for the quips and if you love a decapitation and comedic psycho killer. this for you. if you want this movie for the the creepy background music and the and a lot of suspense go for Halloween. this movie dosen't have a lot of suspense but got a lot of freaky, funny, lot o' gore. :)"
3,***1/2,This funny mix between Scream and every other slasher film added somthing different. It added creepy urban legends that give you the heebe jeebes even when you think of it. And to think that these actuall might of happened. It was fast fun and hillarious. Not as good as Scream or Scream2. But it was better then Friday the 13th. It was a little pridactable but thats what made it so fun. It had some funny moments and crrepy ones. For you IKWYDLS and Scream fans this is a must see!
3,Decent thriller in the same line as Scream,"This is a decent film which I thought was better than Scream. Same general theme, serial killer, beautiful people, etc. It's not gonna get any awards, but a good movie to see with a bunch of friends for screams and laughs. The DVD is standard fare w/o any special material. However, everyone needs atleast one of these in their collection. If you liked Scream 1 & 2 and I Know What... then you'll definitly enjoy this movie. No need to read any of the other reviews on this page which try to give away the whole damn movie. For people who didn't enjoy the movie, they sure have a whole lot to say."
4,It's the scariest horror film I've ever seen!,"I gave it four stars because alot of parts were discusting for instance the part where the girl gets nailed in the head with the axe! I think the director could have edited out some of the blood scenes! After I've seen this I'm afraid to go into my car without checking the back seat. I really didn't like the "" Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the lights"" part! It freaked me out!"
4,It was pretty good,Urban Legend was a good movie. It kept me trying to guess who the killer was through the whole thing. I saw it a couple weeks ago and am still lokking in the back seat when I get into a car.
1,"Oh, the STUPIDITY of it all!","Okay, okay, I give up! The sound that you are now hearing is me throwing out my hopes for the future of the horror film. Once a place where talented individuals like John Carpenter, George Romero, and Don Coscarelli(to name but a few)could tingle our spines and stimulate our minds, the horror genre has become a veritable wasteland of loathsome, brainless junk. Case in point, Urban Legend, a movie so bad that it actually hurts. Who thought that we needed another goofy Scream rip-off? More hip references? Why not? Another ridiculous resolution to a mystery? Sure!! One more hip soundtrack of audio sludge? Bring it on! In our pursuit of dumbing down our youth, we have inadvertantly lobotomized ourselves to the point that we no longer know how to do anything but copy the latest blockbuster. It's sad. Horror is dying.. and we are holding the smoking gun."
3,This movie's okay,"College folklore students are picked off by an urban legend serial killer matching the killing styles from the myths. Though this is just another SCREAM clone, it's a lot better than most with a great killer and a lot of cool cameos from CHUCKY, FREDDY, and MICHAEL MYER'S NIECE. And, unlike I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, this one has some humor. Popcorn, Pepsi and Pizza."
1,"If The Urban Legend Is Boredom And Stupidity, It Wins!","Can I take away that one star I put? What a terrible film with a flimsy premise! The only kind of bright spot was seeing Freddy Krueger veteran, Robert Englund in the film. And then they killed him! Lousy acting and not at all believable villian. Scream, while meant to be tongue-in-cheek anyway, was much more fun than this quickly processed garbage! Go and watch Halloween or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre if you want to have a good fright. The only thing scary about this was everything that wasn't intended to be: script, plot, acting, direction, etc."
2,(I can't find the other half) The next best SCREAM,"A group of college students infatuated with urban legends are knocked off one by one by a psychopathic serial killer imitating the myths. Not the best movie in the world but Devine is funny, Rebecca Gayheart is great as the killer, and there are plenty of hilarious jokes to help the viewer forget about the overboard ending."
3,TOO MUCH LIKE SCREAM,WE ENJOYED THE FILM BUT ONCE YOU SAW SCREAM YOU KNEW WHAT YOU GETTING.YOU KNEW WHO WAS GOING TO BE KILLED BUT I DID'NT KNOW WHO THE KILLER WAS ALL IN ALL A GOOD ENOUGH MOVIE
5,One of the best!!!!,"I thought this movie was one of the best I had ever seen. You would never guess who the killer was. I thought it was almost as scary as Scream, but nothing will beat that."
3,The follow up to the Scream Era,"Urban Legend is a change for the slasher-area of the horror genre but it does nothing for the early movies.The movie does deserve credit for making the story so complicated but other then that the movie is the same old material rehashed for a modern audience.Although the preview looked good when I first saw it I wasn't really impressed.The cast was great including Rebecca Gayheart,who now is a regular on Wasteland.I'll admit I figured out who the killer was before evening seeing the movie because a friend had dropped a small clue, that lead me to put the facts together.Other than that I was surprised.Truthfully this movie should not be overlooked."
2,pretty bad,"This movie had some pretty good scares, and some good laughs. What really i didn't like was the ending when Rebecca Gayheart just acted crazy, was by far the woarst acting i've ever seen. Also the acting of the guy who played parker was horrible too, by far a big disappointment"
3,Better than I thought,"Before I watched this film I expected it to be another pathetic Scream rip-off. Well it is a Scream rip-off but it is not as bad as I thought it would be. I agree that a young female of Rebecca Gayheart's size could not pull off some of the things she did (dragging and hanging Joshua Jackson)...overall it was an entertaining and suspenseful film. And personally I laughed at the ""Noxema Girl"" reference and the Dawson's Creek theme song! Come on people..it's a movie! Entertainment... :)"
3,"Absolutely riveting, tantalizing","I would agree with a previous viewer; half Scream, half I know what you did last Summer. I'd put this one right inbetween. Great plot. Keeps you guessing & has some great lines as well. A must for your DVD collection."
3,"A nice mix of ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer","An over all good movie, even though the end was okay I think it could have been better. Some things in the movie were a little to predictable. If your looking for a scary movie with a bigger twist then ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" and being based on a movie like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" you can stop looking."
1,WHY!?,"Urban Legend: good idea, horrible, horrible movie. The overall idea of an urban legend killer was interesting and I give the creators that much, but the movie was just boring and dumb. I didn't listen to the reviews and gave it a chance, big mistake. This movie was made for money and you can see that through all the crappy one-liners and words that no one even uses. I do have a question though, wasn't there a time when movie making was considered a form of artwork?"
2,Okay sometimes but also stupid,The movie was alright at times but other times totally unreal. Like the part when he e-mails her from the same room how stupid i doubt a killer is walking aroud with a lap-top. And the part with the dog is just nasty and wrong. The beginning was pretty cool because you didn't know what was going to happen but the rest was totally predictable.
1,Just some more teen depraved trash...,"Here We go again. Probably the most unrealistic movie ever. The ""Killer"" was one of those Barbie collecting bitches that have nothing better to do than talk. See it to get an exercise in saying ""SHUT UP!!!"""
1,Awful..,"Trite. Boring. Teenybopper. Urban Legend is terrible, the sort of movie 12- and 13-year-old girls would line up to see. If you want a true horror flick, see any of the Omen series. Unless you go for teenybopper, you'll be disappointed by this one."
2,Not being a big fan of the slasher genre,"who likes films that are actually scary (which means something more intelligent than someone jumping around a corner) I'm often tempted to rent a scary movie that seems to be something beyond the slashing and cutting. Every once in a while I do manage to find a truly scary movie (such as the first The Blair Witch Project), or at least intelligent enough to be give us room for though (the first Scream, for instance). Unfortunately, Urband Legend wasn't such a film - even though it was persumably witty and self referential, just as Scream was. So I'm giving it 2 stars for the effort, but 0 for the result."
2,"Good idea, mediocre delivery","Yeah, the premise is cool, but it wears thin fast. By the end it all just seems so silly and predictable. Decent production values and a few scary moments don't quite make this worth a second watch.Just how did Jared Leto just appear in the other room at the end? And where exactly were they driving to so fast at the end?Good idea, just underdeveloped and mediocre in its delivery."
4,NOT SCREAM BUT VERY VERY GOOD,I LIKED THIS FILM I THOUGHT THE MURDERS WERE VERY WELL DONE AND VERY SCARY IT DOES NOT HAVE THE ATMOSPHERE OF SCREAM YES BUT IT DOES HAVE SOMTHING...SOUL PERHAPS!THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY WELL ACTED AND ALTHOUGH MOST DIE YOU GET TO KNOW THEM ALL VERY WELL MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE MAIN GIRL (ALICIA WIT) COMES OVER VERY WET AND UNTIL THE END OF THE MOVIE I PREFERRED HER BEST FREIND...(WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS THERE RIGHT KIDDIES).AS FOR TENSION AND SCARES OK THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT IS ORIGINAL BUT A FEW OF THE DEATHS ARE SCARY AND SOMTIMES A LITTLE DISGUSTING (THE PRINCIPAL FOR EXAMPLE). I THOUGHT SASHA'S DEATH WAS THE SCARIEST BUT AGAIN I LIKED HER MORE THAN THE MAIN GIRL.ALL IN ALL A GOOD NIGHT IN FILM I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS.NOW I AM GONNA GO WATCH THE SEQUEL.........
5,The Greatest Film Of 1998,"Truly one of the greatest films of all time,with Alicia Witt,Rebecca Gayheart,Jared Leto,Tara Reid & Joshua Jackson making agreat cast look fantastic.The only problem?Gayheart and Witt look like they've been friends ever since Urban Legend."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!,this is must for horror fans and it's great !!!Lots of suspense and it keeps guessing until the very end of the movie!!I love this movie a lot !!Great movie to watch with family and friends or even by your self in the dark!!:)
2,This is a slack compilation,"I think the seventies have many more representative hits than the offered in this compilation. A good compilation needs at least 10 cd's to bring together the highlights of ""golden era of music production"" This is not a good stuff to buy. I recomend AM Gold Collection, Superhits of the 70's (have a nice day) - rated by myself as the best - , a year of your life, and others."
5,perfect condition,The discs and packaging were like new. I was very pleased and would defintely order from this company again.
3,There's better Bon in the vaults...,"The Glasgow footage from 1978, already mentioned in a review, is electrifying. Also stunning is the BBC 'Rock Goes To College' footage from the same year, shot in a small student union hall. Both can be found in excellent quality, though not officially released. This '77 show is relatively lacking in atmosphere by comparison, due to many factors including the venue, sound mix, lighting and not least the performance. I wish 'Family Jewels' had been approached like the Zeppelin DVD or the Iron Maiden early years set - I hope they follow up with such a thing featuring the two stunning 1978 shows. Failing that, a DVD remaster of the 'Let There Be Rock' movie which is better than the 77 show but not nearly as atmospheric as those from '78..."
4,This was released in japan already....,"It is now ""out of print"" over there also... great show though. it was really cool seeing Bon Scott in action. I saw let there be rock years ago,but didnt appreciate it as i was mainly a brian johnson fan. Now that i have added a few years under my belt i completly enjoy the Bon Scott era more."
2,"30"" Pre-Lit Indoor/Outdoor Wreath with Red Lights","The product I received came in a 23"" square box. The company says they measure the wreath at its max point when it is fluffed out. This wreath measures 27"" at best. Like other reviewers, the picture is very misleading and the wreath looks nothing like the one pictured. I called the company and they said they were not accepting returns but they would make an exception. They said I could send it back, AT MY EXPENSE, and if they determine that I received the correct item, I would be charged a 25% restocking fee. This is a very poor policy and the company does not appear to be customer oriented."
5,Great story,This is an excellent book. All Brave Sailors by Revell Carr covers the same story in much greater detail and is also recommended highly.
4,"Excellent, very authentic","This was a very good book, so authentic you almost feel part of the hapless crew of this boat. The strong point is, it was written during the war, and it was not edited afterwards.. Luckily for us readers. You get a very authentic feel of how things were seen then. Excellent, well worth reading!"
4,"Finnish Folk Fun, Finnish Fun Folk","This four person music ensemble of mandolin and guitar, flute and whistle, bagpipes and clarinet, melodeon, harmonica, and fiddle play a variety of tunes. They venture into Celtic, Swedish, and outer Baltic waters. It is difficult to predict where they visit as track follows track, with some fiddle tunes, some polkas, mazurkas, waltzes, a psalm, and an odd ball here and there. These are excellent musicians with wit. A very nice album. [The accordionist, Kimmo Pohjonen, by the way, is the co-composer of the album Uniko, with the Kronos Quartet performing.]"
4,Another Good CJ Floyd Mystery,"The editorial and customer reviews have explained the plot already. This is NOT a typical Greer/ CJ Floyd romp. What makes Robert Greer's books such good reads are the character development and descriptive narative of Denver. CJ Floyd is a Black bailbondsman in Denver, who ends up chasing down some of the most inventive bail jumpers and bad guys around.Limited Time was a bit of a let down after Greer's three previous CJ Floyd books because CJ seemed to be more of a drop in or continuity character than the strong main character of the previous books.The actual mystery aspect was still strong, but I've come to expect more in regards to CJ's ""everyday guy"" personna. Chasing car thieves and street thugs with the help of his more than able staff and friends with street savvy."
5,Excellent reference for any one looking into buying a Saint,Saint Bernards from the Stoan Perspective explains in language anyone can understand what those of us that aren't breeders and long time Saint Bernard owners need to know. It has helped me see what I need to look at when I buy my next saint. Breed standards aren't the easiest to interpret until you understand the terms. It's all spelled out in here.
4,None of these stories to be missed,"This is a solid collection of stories from a master of the short story form. The title story, ""Among the Missing,"" is arguably the strongest of this solid group, about a strange mytery effecting a son's relationship with his aging, eccentric mother who has her own mysterious past. Other notable stories that stay with one long after reading are ""Big Me,"" ""Prodigal,"" and ""Passengers Remain Calm."" Get it and learn how short stories are meant to be written, small pieces of life that enable one to suspend disbelief. Chaon is the master at evoking a suspension of disbelief through minor and major conflict which is what writing is all about."
3,1st story was my favorite,"These stories about sad people are very readable, sometimes engrossing. The only one that really resonates with me, however, is the first, about the young widow and the inflatable dummy. Chaon makes the image of the dummy in the bed with her so natural and compelling; coupled with the widow's day to day ability to function and survive, raise her children, it is not the least maudlin."
2,chaon,"I didn't get as much from this book as from some of Chaon's others. As usual, his characters were well developed, a difficult task, since this is a collection of short stories. However, I was not able to tie a theme into his collection, and unfortunately, didn't gain as much appreciation as some others readers obviously were able to do."
2,Wanna Be Movie.....,"Ok...... slasher type movie with a killer that is a Michael Myer's wanna be! The makers of this movie are dreaming if they think they can come anywhere close to Halloween or Michael Myers!!!! A killing spree began years ago in Devil's Lake. The killings were never solved. Many years later, a local deputy who's parents were among the victims of the killer is investigating a new series of murders that are very similiar to the ones years earlier. Overall, not a great movie. I'd suggest watching it only if you are bored out of your mind!!"
2,2.5-3,"After watching Harvest of Fear, I was all ready to see this movie, it's sequel. Unfortunately, it let me down. The first movie had a better plot and overall better look to it. There were also more kills and more gore in Harvest of Fear. It's an OK movie, but not worth more than a couple dollars."
2,Michael Myers revisited?,"The lead character (killer) is a blatant rip off of Micheal Myers, from the mask and clothing, to the knife, to his demeanor. There was very little I enjoyed about this movie, other than comparing it to others because of the obvious similarities. You even find out who the killer is before he's unmasked. I've seen more mystery in a Scooby Doo episode. If you're a fan of B-movies that are A-movie rip-offs, then this one's for you. If not, don't waste your time."
2,moog control arm bushings,these were great 10 years agonow they make poly replacementsthat last longer and function betterand are easier to installwhy not make these obsolete?
4,1950's Politics and Nixon,"Don't by put off by the inflammatory title of this book. Some potential readers may assume this is just another left leaning author taking a swipe at Nixon. In fact it is a well-researched look at a 1950's senatorial race between two individuals from diametrically opposite ends of the political spectrum.In truth Nixon did used almost every ""trick"" in the playbook to win the election and consequently further his political career. The author lays it out chapter and verse.A bibliography, notes and an index make this a most useful volume for general readers and students interested in Richard Nixon's rise to power."
2,Good and Poor,Just got it and am having trouble getting a consistent flame from the smaller burner. The large burner seems to work fine. The small burner (which uses a different kind of burner ie. cheaper) does not produce an even flame pattern. It is difficult to get lit since most often it pops and the flame goes back into the venturi section (where the gas injector and damper meet). I have tried a range of setting for the damper (which is the only adjustment) without any consistent success. I am waiting for a response for Camp Chef. More to follow.
5,"If you've got ""Never Mind The Bollocks""...","OK, if you've got that great album ""NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS"", there's the only thing left to be done - buy this album. Just because their next album ""The Great R'n'R Swindle"" turned out to be disappointing, but it had a few real good tracks (contributed by Sid Vicious), which all are included here.This is a collection of all the Pistols' singles from 1976 to 1979, so besides the tracks from ""The Swindle"" (and ""Never Mind...""), there is a great deal of famous tracks omitted from ""Never Mind..."": ""No Fun"", ""I Wanna Be Me"", ""Did You No Wrong"", ""Steppin' Stone"" and ""Anarchy In The UK"" - in its raw original version. You wouuld be enough satisfied.[This collection originally was released in 1979 in the U.K.]"
4,Great for any true fan!,"Though this doesn't have the attitude and fury of ""Never Mind The Bollocks"", it is essential for any hardcore fan of the Sex Pistols. Mostly a collection of covers, ""Flogging A Dead Horse"" is definitely memorable and fun to listen to. What's most reassuring is that it's not all ""Bollocks"" rehash, like so many other Pistols albums. The most memorable performances are Sid Vicious' heartfelt and furious butchering of Frank Sinatra's ""My Way"", and the Monkees' ""Stepping Stone (I'm Not Your)"", and among the worst are ""Something Else"" and ""No Fun"". I only gave this four stars because it is mostly non-Pistols material, yet it still rocks out like the Pistols should. This album shows the inspirations of the Sex Pistols' rage filled punk anthems, and gives insight into their musical backgrounds. Though not their best, it is recomended for the true fan."
3,i love the cover!,I bought this cd at the same time i bought the original album. i bought it knowing it was a compilation cd. buy the only true album from the sex pistols. but the cover is great!
3,Another mix of same songs...,"Look at track list, it's combination of Never Mind The Bollocks and Great Rock And Roll Swindle. Get those.IIRC there is a weird version of No One Is Innocent on this album, the one that keeps speeding up, not tempo but as if somebody ran the tape faster and faster (pitch goes up as well).Ok, so there No fun (Iggy Pop's song) which is not on Never mind or Swindle albums..."
2,Wobbly wobbler,"Not a bad product, but I find my son tends to tip back the wagon too much as he is walking. The wagon just seems a bit too light, even with a few toys tossed inside.My boy prefers the tonka truck walker better, it doesn't tip over and he can get rough with it without any worries."
1,The Amazing Art of Pyrography,"I was extremely disappointed. The book was quite expensive and I felt it was 90% Ads promoting his Pyrography equipment! He belittled equipment made by other manufacturers, which I felt in poor taste. With the exception of the demonstrations on birds, the remainder of instruction was quite superficial."
5,THE BIBLE OF BURNNING,"THIS BOOK HAS EVERY TYPE OF BURNING THERE IS, EXPALINES THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WOOD, BURNERS, TIPS, IF YOUR SERIOUS ABOUT BURNING THIS BOOK IS A MUST."
5,Great Version of a Classic Card Game,"I saw this item and ordered it to teach my 7 and 9 year old children Canasta. I thought the colorful version would make it more interesting. I was extremely pleased when I got it. Not only is it true to the game, but the colors and revolving card tray make it easy for new players to learn.I'd recommend it very highly to current Canasta players and to anyone who wants to play a rummy type game with their children."
1,Fun Game Lousy Cards,Fun game. Lousy cards. Two of the cards were torn but that wasn't what bothered us the most. The cards have some kind of powder that makes your hands feel dirty and sticky. We could actually taste this stuff. Strange. We really wonder what it is that they put on them in China. Any answer?Winning Moves Games Canasta Caliente
4,New version of Canasta?,"The game comes without any instructions...the first game I've ever purchased in my life without any. Fortunately, I know how to play canasta, but this set introduces a new ""hot"" card for a variation in play. Problem is, no direction as to how it is used."
4,Good overview,This is a good overview of the largest naval battle of the first world war. Excellent as a reference and for begining study of this famous but little known battle of dreadnaughts and light forces.
3,Reasonable,"The stories provided here are, if nothing else, entertaining light reading. I happily read the Jeeves story, and after going over a few of the others, I downloaded some later Wodehouse and read that. It's certainly worth picking up for people interested in the general writing of the time period, and anything involving Jeeves is useful for the sake of understanding continuity, but, on the whole, the stories are mediocre. Still, it's well formatted, and I can't complain about the technical quality of it. The price is reasonable. It's worth picking up, but not something I would strongly suggest."
3,Nice quick light read.,"Nice light read even if a little naive and predictable, but that I think is part of the charm of a past era."
5,If you love classic Wodehouse...,"If you love classic Wodehouse then this book needs no review. It is charming, interesting and a delightful read. Make a pot of tea, collect a few biscuits, and curl up to read and enjoy."
4,Great laughter!,"Whenever P.G. Wodehouse describes a scene or a person, one gets the visual image immediately, and it is always hilarious."
2,Bought by Mistake,"I am rating this for the Kindle edition. I was downloading some of the free Kindle editions of Wodehouse and accidentally clicked on this book and am out $7.99. It was my stupid mistake, of course, but I wish that amazon.com would separate the free books from the paid ones. I expect that I'm not the only person who has inadvertently bought something that s/he thought was free."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY (NTI),"Zero stars for this company's products! I was sold a product direct from them that was incompatible. I have spent hours in arguments over refunds, etc. Sales reps and Cust Sevr untrained. They DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR COMPANY/PRODUCT! BEWARE."
2,Not as good as the prepared stuff,"This is good, but not as tasty as the stuff you buy in the stores already prepared. It does have a slight aftertaste, and since I'm more calorie-conscious than worried about suger (not diabetic), I went back to the regular pudding; tastes 10 times better and more chocolaty! :)"
5,Excellent smoke alarm,"Already had one of these in house. Very easy to install, and very easy to change battery. Same model was $18 at Home Depot. Saved $10 by getting it on Amazon."
2,"Worked for two years, then turned to junk","The design is great with the front loading battery and the hush button. The thing hung on the family room ceiling for two years, standing guard, silently. Then it began to beep, announcing the need for a new battery, which is promptly got. But it still beeped. I cleaned it out with canned compressed air, and it still beeped. Then I threw it away."
3,Doesn't lock in place and old stock,"I purchased 2 of these for my Uncle's house from a third party seller (THE VALUE BAY) which was Fulfilled by Amazon. They use the same mounting ring as the hardwired units (Kidde PI2010) I purchased a few months ago for my own house; however, unlike mine, these units do not click into place or have the ability to lock into the mounting ring, they just sit there. I guess they will stay put, but it's stupid that they don't take advantage of the mounting ring's features. Also both detectors had a manufacture date of July 2008, which means they are now 3 years old. Hopefully they last 10 years from today."
1,Buyer beware!,"The printer in this photo is NOT what will arrive -- instead it is a 100+ pound monstrosity that does NOT print 11x17 without a part that costs -- no kidding -- $700 plus. Since printing 11x17 is all we wanted it to do, I am stuck repackaging and shipping at my expense this useless behemouth. I have never had a bad experience with amazon before -- I am such a believer I own stock -- but I will think twice before EVER buying office equipment on amazon again."
3,A Good Knife,"I just got the knife,and overall it is nice. I had a couple of Case knives over the years, and it is good to see the quality hasn't changed. Case was always my favorite brand, and I am pleased to own another beautiful, well-made Case knife.I would say to anyone looking for a good pocket knife, that they can't go wrong with Case, and this model is perfect for taking anywhere and will prove a most useful tool. It also makes a unique gift for yourself or someone else,either to add to a collection, or simply as a fine example of Americana. The pocket knife is an American icon. I did notice a curious thing about this knife: The blades don't open straight out from the end of the handle. I have since found out that this is not a defect, but something the company tried, which did not go over with collectors, and they now make the knife the conventional way. I will probably see abouthaving it replaced for a new ""conventional"" one."
2,It's ok,Pircewise it's OK... delivery was just awful! I wouldn't purchase from the seller I got it unless It's a MUST
2,waiting,I still haven't recieved my order and it has been past the day it was due to come. I ordered it December 28th and still have not recieved it. Its only a little memory card its not like its a huge package.
4,Great for the price,"This is a great product to buy if you want to put movies, pictures, music and more on your PSP. Be advised that you only get 949mb of space to start with when you insert it into your PSP. Other than that I say for the price this is a must buy."
1,You don't need it.,"Buy a normal 2GB SanDisk memory stick and it'll work just as good on your PSP with twice as much memory and half the costSanDisk 2 GB MemoryStick Pro Duo (SDMSPD-2048-A11, Retail Package)."
1,It sucks!!!!,This memory stick sucked. First It didn't work period. Then they charged almost $5.00 for shipping and handling when it came in a regular envelope. I am seriously contemplating not buying anything off Amazon.com again. The only reason I gave it a one star was so the reveiw would go through. I don't want anyone else to get gipped.
5,Awesome!!!,This is an awesome memory stick and works great with the Sony PSP. I can put about 3 movies and 30 songs on there with about 100MB still free. I really recommend this for its performance and value.
4,complex stars,"Like so many of us, the two authors are fascinated with stars. They have created 48 star blocks that can be pieced as 9-patch units, reducing or eliminating the bulky seams in the center that often plague complex star blocks. These stars have some unusual shapes and the book includes complete instructions for assembling the different combinations. A huge Gallery section shows many possibilities for using the star blocks. This is not a book for beginners since there are no project directions. You are presented with inspiration and raw materials and left to create your own masterpieces. You can make your own templates from the patterns provided or order acrylic templates for rotary cutting. I was sorry that this was not available online so that I could check out the price and get instant gratification."
2,"Covers points, but neither in a clear or concise manner.","If you're looking for a clear, easy to understand work, this is not for you. It seems the author fluctuates between writing for a population that is well versed in statistical understanding, to one that is just learning concepts and terms. The reader ends up being tossed around with too much information at times, and at other times too little information. There are many, many better works on these topics."
3,Missing voucher: how to get it,"There is supposed to be a voucher for the online/downloadable version included. This is missing. O'Reilly knows about this problem: see information at [...]to get the required code (haven't received it yet, but only recently requested it)."
5,Voices of the angels...,"When I first heard this album -- almost ten years ago, now -- I was totally blown away. If you've ever wondered what angels sound like when they sing, this will surely be the closest you're going to get this side of Heaven. Sure, the lyrics are in Finnish, but that makes little difference. The music and spirit transcends all and, after listening, you'll be left in a state of bliss. Of special note are tracks 3 (Kyla Vuotti Uutaa Kuuta) and 8 (Leppiainen). If you're curious about Varttina, this album is a terrific entry point, smack dab in the middle of their musical progression from traditional Finnish folk group to world music powerhouse.Highly recommended.By the way, this album became my entry point into a vast treasure trove of might be best called ""progressive scandinavian folk"" music. Be sure to check out other Varttina albums, as well as the work of Hedningarna and Garmarna from Sweden, Sorten Muld from Denmark, and Sirmakka from Finland."
5,Great for misc thingies,Great for a place to put all those little misc hardware pieces that seem to be always left out.
5,Great organizer,"I bought one of these for myself for my desk at school, and I love it! It keeps all my pens, pencils, etc., neatly organized and readily available. Plus, it's just a little different from the usual desktop organizers.I like it so much that I bought one for my son to use as he heads off to college and dorm life, where space management will be essential!"
4,"You don't need it, but you must have it.","Two ugly coffee mugs will do the same job, but how cool is your accountant's logo and maybe a Local 1030 Environmental Workers of NJ mug gonna stack up to a BucketBoss?Look, you worked hard to get off the jobsite and into a chair. You wear shirts with buttons. You have a slight crease in your pants. Your shoes are relatively clean. But you still remember eating lunch out of a box, wearing work boots, and having your own nicked-up hardhat. The BucketBoss lets people know you still know how to kick someone's behind for slacking on the job.And it keeps the pens separated nicely from the pencils, and doesn't let the Sharpies get mixed up with either of them.Fred"
3,Nothing special,"A handy little desk-top gizmo, but it only fits a certain size mug well, and the material is so stiff, it makes it hard to get things into the pockets.Not bad, but I wouldn't buy it again. Its big brother, the Bucket Boss - outstanding."
3,Not that practical! But cute!,"""Any 10 oz mug?"" Sure, if it's a skinny one. The pockets? Most won't hold anything bigger than a pencil, and a tight sqeeze, there. Still, a great ""guy thing"" statement, which was much appreciated on Father's Day in our home. (Along with the actual *big* Bucket Boss, which we have yet to test out. Now, where was that bucket?)"
4,you get what you expect,"These are basic figures that delight my 6 year old daughter. They are exactly what you expect. I like this kind of toy because it requires active, imaginative play. 4 instead of 5 stars because they are slightly more expensive than I would have liked to pay, but not a rip-off by any means."
1,This blade should NOT have the dewalt name on it - it TERRIBLE !!!!,"So, i have the dewalt 18v cordless saw w/ lithium batteries, brand new... i made a few 2x4 cuts and some 1/2-inch ply wood cuts and this blade started smoking the wood... it is a terrible blade.The 18tooth blade is terrible... and so is this 24tooth.... just as bad...I actually bought this 24t blade and returned it... i thought maybe i just wore it out too fast... not the case... dewalt has a horrible product they put their name on.I was looking for a replacement here on amazon. I found the Freud 24tooth blade for $10 shipped w/ amazon prime... WOW - the Freud Blade is AMAZING.... Do not waste your money with this dewalt saw blade if you're making many cuts in any wood....I can't believe dewalt has made such a horrible product with their name on it... I know its the blade that came with the saw, and its the starter blade... but to only make a few cuts is terrible!!!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS BLADE"
4,A heroin ahead of her time:,What a life Margaret lived with her mate in Russia! This is an extremely moving book. It leaves one feeling apalled at the horrendous conditions in which these people lived and tried to survive. Margaret's life story is certainly a tale worth reading.
5,Quality Cuteness Simplicity,"This pram is a sweet little cart. Very well made and a cinch to assemble. Just screw the already attached handle bar in the position you want it! Love the rubber wheels--super soft smooth ride. My one year old loads it with toys and pushes it everywhere. It can go fast and sometimes topples over because she can't keep up with it, but that's the learning part, right?"
5,Wok with me!,"Great wok set with almost everything you might need to start off with. I also purchased a hoak(ladle) and a strainer(for deep frying) to complete the set. Now I can stir fry, deep fry, and scoop up liquids!The seasoning process was fairly easy and straight forward but the fumes from seasoning it in the oven gave me a nasty headache. I had all my windows open and my ventilation on high. Anyways, it seasoned nicely and I've already stir fried a few dishes to great success.."
1,HORRIBLE!,Even after seasoning it you still get a sort of silver paint coming off on a paper towel ... yeah cause that's something I want to end up IN my food.
2,Dated version of a Classic,"This BBC production definately shows its age especially in the acting department.Nigel Havers, who plays the lead, manages to appear sincere even though there doesn't seem to be a lot of depth to his characterisation. But it is actress Kate Nichols, as his sister kate Nickleby, that is particularly painful to watch...her acting range appears to be limited to looking started,puzzled and vaguely troubled...with a few prolonged crying fits thrown in. She alone makes you want to hit the fast foward button.A particularly lacklustre production."
1,Horrified - IF I COULD IT'd be NO STARS,"You know, I'm usully not a freak out when it comes to outrage on a movie when they abuse someone in the sake of comedy, but this one I just have to. I just watched this awful show on television. It is listed as a comedy and I don't see anything funny about it! An outright abusive, unloving ... of a mother and her gold digger boyfriend abuse and force an obviously troubled psychologically young girl into singing for their own ends instead of getting the girl into therapy! This show is awful."
4,"BIG VOICE, GREAT TIME","Another small, scene stealer film from England, Little Voice is loaded with three tour de force performance s by Jane Horrocks, Michael Caine, and Blenda Blethyn. Horrocks is ""Little Voice,"" the shyest of the shy daughter of a dead record store owner who is overshadowed by the obnoxious mother of mother's (Blethyn). Caine is a small time promoter who hears LV singing to her old 33 LP collection and realizes she is a golden opportunity for him to make it to the big time. LV sings to avoid the reality of her mother and her mother's lovers, but mostly, she sings to remember her father, the only kindness in her wretched life. Ewan McGregor in a small bit part befriends LV, but it is Horrocks stunning singing voice that captures the film and attention. Reprising her stage role, Horrock's dead on immitations of Garland, Shirley Bassey, and Marilyn Monroe are superb.This film is a gem and should be a part of every film library both for it's story and the music."
4,Little Voice,Fabulous sleeper of a movie. Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine were terrific and Jane Horrocks' singing a revelation. Ewan McGregor was a nice surprise as Little Voice's beau.
4,"Jane is talented, Ewan is hot.","I enjoyed the movie. It was funny and very entertaining. Jane Horrocks is so wonderful in this movie, her impressions are impressive. I loved the music, I happen to share the love for Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Marilyn Monroe, as does the character, L.V. If you didn't enjoy the film, don't waste your time writing an review with so many misspelled words. Oh, and I must mention, Ewan Mcgregor is very ""cute"" in this film. I only wished it had more of an ending. But despite that, i loved it still."
1,AWFUL!,"This movie was horrible! The flimsy plot was written around one woman's ability to do remarkably accurate impersonations, though that's not nearly enough to carry this seemingly endless wretch of a film. It's dreary, depressing, and, dull."
2,Real Little,"Annoying people doing annoying little desperate things is this one. A little light hearted, but mostly the villian, Michael Caine, a talent agent of little worth, makes Little Voice a local star for a little while, till she breaks away from her loudmouth mummy and has a little romance. I watched this with three people and one fell asleep by the little ending."
3,Tony of Stockport,This could have been a better film without Brenda Blethyn's over the top performance. Her (supposedly) Yorkshire accent was totally devoid of glottal stops and nowhere near laconic enough. Yorkshire people do not rant in that way. Another reviewer referred to it as Cockney. Cockneys live in London. Brenda Blethyn is Welsh and it showed in her speech cadences
4,When life takes some radical turns...,"LV lives in the shadow of a bosterous and demanding mother, Mari. This experience has turned LV into a pathologically quiet and subdued young woman, who doesn't leave home, and finds enjoyment only in listening to and singing along with her vinyl records. One day she is overheard by Mari's date, a small-time promoter, who decides LV is his ticket to the big time. LV agrees to do one show, and blows away the audience. What happens next defines all the characters in this movie.I'd rate it PG. Expect great acting (especially Michael Caine in an unflattering role), and an entertaining story. But this is no Cinderella story; things will not turn out as you expect."
4,Cool!,"I wasn't looking forward to this movie very much, and it seemed to have a pretty slow start...and then suddenly I was drawn in. I loved the plot and felt so sorry for LV, while at the same sympathising with Mari and Ray...and the ending was so tension-filled I was bouncing up and down screaming at the TV. Normally I find Horrocks rather annoying but she, like the rest of the cast, was brilliant in this and I was most impressed by her singing. The only thing is that I felt the film ended a bit abruptly. Like you never found out how LV sorted things out with her mother. It was a good ending but it just had some blanks to it.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes slightly grim social-reality movies, who is interested in singing, or is shy. Check it out!"
5,Stunning!,"Filmed in Scarborough, Yorkshire, by a director (Mark Herman) who has his finger on the pulse of real Yorkshire life (witness ""Brassed Off""). This film should have cleaned up at the Oscars. Michael Caine at his sensational best!"
4,Absolutely worth buying,"Everyone in this movie delivers a great performance. Sometimes, though, the heavy British accents are difficult to understand, and the ending is slightly cheesy. However, as a whole the movie is charming and should be in everybody's video library."
5,Wonderful! A Definite Must-See!!!!,I am a big fan of British films but for some reason I did not think I would like this movie! But the other night I saw it and I was mesmorized by the film and the taltented actors who were in it! Jane Horrock's performance as the title character was magical! I recommended it to everyone who enjoys crying and laughing at the same time!!
4,Little Voice...cute movie,"LITTLE VOICE. There is some really great talent in this film. Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge, Iris) and Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge, Star Wars, Black Hawk Down etc) especially."
3,Good Beginning,"The movie loses steam towards the end, and the only character I liked for the whole movie was Ewan McGregor's. His scenes with Jane Horrocks were the best part of the movie. Jane Horrocks does excellent impersonations of stars, but her character is rather annoying when she's not singing."
1,"Dont believe the five star reviews, they must be family","Poor characters, weak relations, unbelievable plot. I will not be reading anything else by Harlan. It looks as if he has read a lot of Turtledove and wants to emulate his style.He fails.Do not waste your money on this book, and I cannot believe all the five star reviews. Di we all get the same edition? Must be family of the author.HA"
5,Complex and engrossing alternate historical fantasy.,"This volume is part one of a series set in an alternate Roman empire, where the West does not fall, and every legion has a body of thaumaturges attached. Lots of characters, lots of action and intrigue, evil and good of mythic proportions, and a good sense of history allow this book to burrow itself into your mind and find a cozy home.This work is set in approximately 600 CE, and in addition to the Romans, East and West, you will find Persians, Khazars, Celts, and others mixed into epic events. Carrying the plot are a Roman wizard, a Gallic swordswoman, and a cast of thousands."
1,Too red.,"I ordered the lightest shade (tan)becaused I am blonde. When applied it has a reddish cast, which certainly doesn't look natural."
2,"Colours are way off, stencils are OK","I was really excited to get this, because I have very sparse eyebrows. Honestly, it was very disappointing. It's no where near dark brown, it's more of a greenish brown colour, I'm not sure what hair colour you would have to have for it to match. The stencils are ok, they're better than a lot that are out there."
5,christian tan eyebrow kit,I don't go out without using this wonderfull guide for a perfect eyebrow. I have fair skin & the tan shade fits perfect. I will buy it again and again.
5,College Text,I used this for a college class. Glad you had it so cheap! Thanks for the prompt shipping.
5,Perhaps the best summary of pratical educational research,This summary of research in human learning and what this body of knowledge suggests should be the direction of education in the next 10 years makes this work a must read for any educational professional. We owe a debt of gratitude to the National Research Council for the depth and quality of this work. It is already being used by many educators in the Bay Area to guide teachers and school administrators in their efforts to provide an education that prepares our young people for the next century! This would make an outstanding resource for both working teachers and those studyiong education at the graduate level.
2,Clear as mud,"I am amazed at the high praise of this opauely written book. I find I have to read sentences over and over to figure out what the actual point of the sentence is. ""Edu-talk"" and a prolix writing style (by committee? a camel?) makes this anything but ""reader-friendly."" Good luck slogging through it."
5,What all teachers should know,"The tome ""How Learners Learn"" is what your worthless education courses SHOULD have been teaching you, but didn't because the politicians and the professors would rather push their agendas. If the teacher is to actually teach--convey information from one human to another--then the teacher must know how humans acquire information. That's what this book goes into. Oddly, that is also what outfits such as the federal department of education never go into.Read this book; buy it if you must, borrow it if you can, but read it."
4,best wath for Heart Rate,"Is an accessory that despite being very elegant, can be used for sports such as diving, climbing, cycling, in addition to a great extreme Durability and low temperatures and high pressures, is able to shine at night neatly ."
1,Cheap substitution sent,The photo originally shown was different and a set that I had previously ordered and liked. The very light weight and poor quality set was substituted. I immediately requested the correct product with a quick reply and apology with the promise of the correct set was being shipped. Nothing has arrived and no further response has been received from follow up e-mails. (They have since changed the photo to show the lesser quality product!)
3,Do the job,Not anything unique or unusual but are fine to get the job done. Priced about right. Simple help for everyday.
1,don't purchase,"These spoons may help to remove the grapefruit sections a little easier, but you can't eat with them as the serrated edge is very rough on your mouth. I was looking for a spoon I could use thru out the eating experience and these are not at all like I wanted."
4,Has all the info I need,This was a great textbook. It had all the information I need and still need to this day. I find myself refering to this text often for assignments. It was organized well and has many great tips. Overall this was a great textbook. Short and sweet.
4,For a college book it was very thorough...,"Purchased this book for a college course needed and found this book to be very helpful as a follow up from Stats. This text,however, is based upon using statistics for completing research methods using calculations based upon probability and theories for Psychological research and theoretical testing. Glad I took a Statistics class prior to taking this course as I probably would not have understood the theory behind the formulas for Stats used in this text. It was a great book, and I recommend this text for Psychological Stats classes for all colleges. As for the seller, awesome... book arrived on time and was in the exact condition as stated."
2,"Paid too much, and got it too late",Truth is I paid $120.00 for a textbook that arrived too late for my daughter. She had to buy the book at her school SUNY Albany paid $60.00 for the same textbook. Go figure Looks like what the new thing is why buy when you can now rent. The last thing a student wants is generally reading this book ever again after the coarse has been completed let alone having to keep it.
4,Fantastic!!!,"Great Melodic Hard Rock/AOR. In the vein of House of Lords highlights. One of the best CD of this year. Don't think twice, buy it now."
4,A must read for small group leaders!,"Of the books I have read that deal with small group dynamics and leadership, this is by far the most thorough. Julie A. Gorman herein conveys some fairly abstract concepts in a very simple and conversational manner with practical examples and exercises to cement the knowledge gained."
1,The most unimaginative film,"I saw this film with two friends. We all agreed that this film was one of the worst films we have ever seen. The dialog was trite and unimaginative. The only pleasure we had watching this film was mimicking the actor's repeated lines ""Oh my God! What are you doing here?"""
3,Worth seeing once.,"Another cute movie about love at first sight, destiny, regret, and the responsibilities that follow. The story's web of coincidences proves highly predictable as long as you're paying attention. The smart thought-provoking dialogue pulled me into the characters' dilemma. I couldn't decide know whether to judge Dana and Sean selfish or hopelessly romantic. Like many other viewers, I found Foyt's character rather annoying... very whiny and spastic. The cinematography is terrible. I haven't researched whether or not this was a low-budget film, but I'm hoping it was because the cameraman zoomed in and out spontaneously without any real purpose or direction. This drew my attention away from the story many times, especially near the beginning.Despite these annoyances, the creative dialogue (most of it anyway) and feel-good, tear-jerking ending makes Deja Vu worth seeing at least once."
3,remarkable,"the scenario of this movie is brilliant. the words that are said suits so much to the plot, but it really can be much effective with a slightly dramatic effects of camera movements usage of sound and emhasizing the close-ups...i don't know its so much inspiring me... thank anyway to putting some words to open view...its so brave to just let the words make us listen..."
3,Soulful messages,"Not great in the acting or dialog departments but Dillane is refreshing (as usual). Watch it for the content... Venessa Redgrave and her Mom appear in this film... I loved Venessa's line: ""An illusion is a scent of what's real coming close."" Definitely a ""chick flick""."
2,"Great story line, poor acting.","This could have been major hit, the acting was dry and the scenery was drab. The story line was so loving that it is still worth watching if you are a romantic person. Wish this could be redone with more warmth!"
2,"great premise, not so great execution","For lovers of romantic films, the idea sounds great: A mysterious woman gives another woman a brooch that will lead the recipient to her future true love, a true love that will reignite a flame of love and passion that was first ignited a generation before. Unfortunately, (although typical for a Jaglom film) much of the movie is given to meaningful babble that in this film serves only to draw out the ultimate conclusion, a conclusion that could have come a lot earlier, or at least with more imagination. It doesn't help that Victoria Foyt, while a dream to watch and fantasize about, begins to truly annoy with her whiny interpretation of the female lead. It would be nice if the film were shelved and the sound track were released; the soundtrack being a wonderful compilation of truly inspired, vintage romantic music, and well performed at that."
1,Only One Good Thing About It,"Two questions: Why has Stephen Dillane done so few films? and Why did he choose to contribute his significant talent, charisma and appeal to this dog? I rented it to see his performance, which even in an abyss of bad writing such as this, was very good. But the rest... ugh. The lead female actress has SO little to recommend her. The dialogue was painful. The score was drippy. Even the scenery was rendered bland by the company it kept in thei film.Please, Stephen Dillane: Do not cast your pearls before swine."
2,Less than it could have been.,"After the terrific reviews, I had expected better.The Idea is indeed a good one, but the lead actress is... awfull (I'm sorry to say it, but there it is.) She is whiny, complaining, selfish, and just generally irritating.While watching the movie, I just kept wondering why any of these people would want to spent time with her, let alone, seek her out or leave their wife for her.To say something good about the film, the filming locations (Paris, Cliffs of Dover, etc.) were excellent and beautiful. And the rest of the cast could act and was wonderful!"
4,DeJa Vu hit home,"I rented DeJa Vu and Cassablanca both on the same weekend. I had never seen either movie and was so shocked to see the similarities. I was in tears with both movies and felt that the director of DeJa Vu should have chosen a younger sexier actress than Victoria Foyt. I thought she had too many temper tantrums and could of portrayed more passion. I would of liked to have seen more of the love scenes also...I felt the house party scene was very good. It had me on the edge of my seat and I felt like I was right there in the room with the actors. I really enjoyed the line that went something like.... ""An Illusion is really the feeling of something good coming close""."
2,the lead actress is a holy terror....a test of endurance...,"the concept is lovely...some of the dialogue is actually literate and smart...but the lead actress, as mentioned by so many others, is so unrelentingly whiny and irritating you can barely look at the screen when she is on...i'm watching the vhs version right now as i type and find the movie is more palatable if i can type and watch together to dissipate the really annoying stuff. okay, i'm also watching the clock at the same time because i want to see how it ends but wonder if i can bear the whole thing. my god, what a difference a lead actress with acting ability would have made. the lead actor is so subtle and lovely you can't imagine how he ended up playing against her."
4,Do you believe in love?,The story begins in Israel when a young woman is buyingclothes for her future business. The history of herfather during WWII comes to haunt her as a woman he met in Paris.The specially made pin the older woman leaves takes her toParis where she finds the jeweler who made it.For some reason she gets off the train in Doverand meets a painter there.Events seem designed to draw them togetherin a knot of love that seems like a destiny they didn't know they had.This movie is kind of a slow moving English filmwith a lot of talking and the female character Dana seems pretty empty headedor absent minded. I liked the film that had a sentimentthat was from maybe a better period of history than the present?
5,Deja Vu over and over,"This is quite simply a beautiful love story. But it also has a sweet twist to it which is intruiging, mysterious, and enjoyable.As the plot develops the film sweeps you along to experience travel to various countries and cities: Israel, the cliffs of Dover, London, Los Angeles, and Paris! Another great feature is that the writer/director Henry Jaglom gives his accomplished actors free rein to extemporize. This creates a very natural and dynamic dialogue between actors which is so refreshing. In this regard it is also worth watching/hearing the actors speak about this experience in the ""behind the scenes featurette"". I saw this film in 1998 and I have never forgotten it. Thus I decided this year, after searching high and low for it, to buy it right away from Amazon, so that I could have the ""Deja Vu!"" experience all over again :)"
4,decent script. need another lead actress,"This film has potential. There are some poignant moments that explain chance happenings from a romantic's perspective and these were delivered by Vanessa Redgrave, who was the only actor i enjoyed watching in this movie. I was embarrassed watching the lead actress. She was whiny and seemed too old for the part because she didn't have that innocent/struggling to find own identity/trying to figure out the world quality or look about her. She looked like someone who has it figured out and used whining and hysterics to portray otherwise."
2,Poor color,the DVD color is very poor in comparison with the VHS version. It's watchable but only if you like the movie and the actors.
3,the scenery was nice,"This movie is 99% dialogue, and most of that dialogue is improvised. Luckily, the actors are good at it, but the improvisation shows. The other one percent is travelogue, and the scenes of Jerusalem, Paris and Dover add to the movie.A number of movies have tackled the love-of-one's-life phenomenon, but the others used some kind of story to try to get the feeling across. This movie merely talks about it.The lead actress was actively off-putting. I didn't find her whiney, just not particularly likeable, and certainly not attractive. In any love story, the audience (or at least half of it) has to fall in love with the female lead. The other half has to go for the male lead. It was impossible to like, much less love, this female lead.Bottom line: worth seeing once for the scenery, if you can get it for a VERY low price."
3,Dick Francis Mysteries,Enjoyed reading the Dick Francis mysteries more than the videos. Thought Ian McShane would make it a good thriller but was disappointed. The cast didn't ring true.
3,Dated,"The stories are intriguing, but it is hard to not notice that they were filmed in the 80's/90's. The first two stories are better than the last one. The books are better."
4,Classic 80's TV,"OK, it's not high art, but it is entertaining. Ian McShane fans get to see him in a lighter comedy role. Fun to watch. The storied get better as the series progresses."
1,Truly Dreadful,These movies are an insult to a wonderful writer. They would make a Tom Mix movies look like Oscar winners in comparison. Francis is unfailingly a great read but skip these movies.
1,Terrible,"If you are a fan of quality British Mysteries (Inspector Morse, Inspector Frost, Touching Evil,Wire in the Blood, Last Detective, etc) and think you might be getting something like that with this series because of McShane of Lovejoy fame think again. This is an American made for TV movie with second rate American actors, terrible script and dialouge. To add insult to injury the Inspectors name in one of the films was Frost! Very cheesy America early 80's style TV B movies."
2,Disappointed Mom/Less-Than-Enthusiastic 4 year old,"My son could not wait until his fourth birthday! He knew that his grandfather had purchased Sky High Rescue for him, and he had wanted that toy so badly!! When he received the well-intentioned gift, my father and I were sorely disappointed. It was flimsy, awkward, and just not much fun. My son was a little disappointed, but continues to play with it. I don't know how this toy can be improved, but the commercial surely portrays a much higher quality product than it actually is! I wish this were a more positive review."
1,Big Disappointment !,"My 3 yr. old son saw this in the toy store and just had to have it. I've heard that matchbox toys are very well made and durable, so I don't know what happened to this one! We brought it straight home from the store and put it together. The directions were simple enough, but it was hard to snap the pieces together. As soon as my son began playing, it was obvious this toy was not going to last long. Every time he put a little pressure on the ramp with his car or bumped into it, pieces started coming apart. We were both aggravated and disappointed with this toy and we are going to return it today!!"
1,Skip this one,This was a gift that my son received for his birthday. It's already going into the goodwill bin. The thing was a pain to put together (my husband and 8 year old daughter spent about 20 minutes figuring out how it went together) and fell apart the moment it was moved. A much better toy in this category is the Fisher Price Spiral Speedway.
1,Very Disappointing,"This toy was a new venture for my 3 1/2 yr. old son. He was moving up to bigger & better things (or so we thought). Putting this toy together was fairly simple, however, keeping it together was a different story. Move it once, and it falls apart. Continually, while he played; he would call me in his room to fix it. Needless to say, it's now in the attic. There is no support to this flimsy product, which makes it completely useless. We will be more careful in our next selection."
1,Very disappointing,"Ok, pretty easy to put together, but that's what you do constantly, put it back together. You give your child something to play with independently, and every 60 seconds, ""Mommy, can you fix this?"" Not very fun."
1,Falls apart,You will definetly like this item if you like toys that fall apart. I spent more time putting it back together than my son had to play with it. Save your money.
5,I think some could relate,"If you like middle aged men reminiscing about their glory days before they screwed up their lives - and want to see what the years do to a recreational baseball team, Rick Cohen's ""Faded Glory"" will work for you. Cohen assembles his aging Bad News Bears baseball team and tries to take them back to a championship. A charismatic, self-centered and irrepressible former actor, Cohen bulldozes arthritic joints, pulled muscles, and various addictions to a victory that almost could have been sponsored by AARP. I was hurting just watching them, not to mention the in-need-of-much-therapy family dramas of all the men. Seriously, a not bad documentary about baseball, guys, and redemption. I'd watch it again and recommend it to others."
3,Been a while but still a fun read,"OK, so I haven't read the ""Mom"" books since I discovered them in my hometown library in the 90s, but I remember loving them so much I just had to look them up again (ok and see if they were available for my kindle) I noticed that they only had only star and I thought it deserved better than that, even if I can't remember the whole plotline. Out of all the ""Mom"" books this was my favorite. Maybe because it was about theatre, maybe because I was taking the play in school, maybe just because I love the idea of an elderly woman solving murder mysteries which a shrug of her shoulders and an ""I'm your mother, that's why"" kinda attitude. Just a fun book to read and a good series overall."
3,Not one of the best from LA Theater (mild spoilers inside),"The love story of man who has not recovered yet from the death of his most beloved wife and a woman just recovering from a failed marriage. The first part of the play is fairly amusing and the witticisms of the main male character's brother provide funny intermissions throughout the play. However, I found the second part not very well thought out, and overall I found this to be a fairly forgettable play. Acting is good, even if LA Theater has done much better things, I believe. But the way the two lovers suddenly change after marriage is not credible at all. It all seemed concocted to lead to a love-hate-love again structure that could have made sense in this play, but not in such a rush format. But then, maybe I don't like Neil Simon's plays much."
4,Good dome light replacement,"I received this dome/courtesy light pretty fast and it was well packaged. Its basic, no frills and pretty easy to hook up. The LED's should make it very low current draw and long lasting too. Great price from Amazon."
5,The Mahler Way,Hampson adds more to the beautiful music of Mahler...Everything is exactly the way it has to be...His German is very good...he makes wonderful musical phrases...He feels it and makes you feel it...and I think He has made this recording at once ...because I have listened him live singing Mahler...the performance was exactly the same with the recording :)
3,Mahler plus; Berio minus,"Mahler wrote some of the finest lieder in the 19th century. Thomas Hampson is one of the finest baritones of the 20th and performs these lieder in a grand style. However, Berio's orchestrations add nothing. On the contrary, they detract from the overall sense of the songs. Compare the first 11 (with piano accompaniment with the last 11 (with orchestra). The wonderment of Mahler disappears."
4,"easy to use, requires patience to set up; look at backstrap looms","I just pulled this loom out of storage (saved by my mother from when I had it 30 years ago!) and set it up for my very eager 8 year old. She has previously done paper and grass weaving, and just learned how to knit. She loves the loom, which has stood up to a great deal of use (and even more storage). She watched part of the set up this time, and I've let her know I will do it once more, and will help her once after that -- then I'm done with set-up duty. She's been weaving for about an hour, and has about 9 inches of cloth, I think. Also check out backstrap looms. I set up my 4 3/4 year old with an off-the-cuff one out of posterboard since she was interested in the other loom. She's off and running. I'll make her a sturdier one (or buy one for her) since she's sticking with it and that loom didn't seem to make it into the ""keep forever"" boxes from my chiildhood."
4,good toy,"I bought this loom for myself to find out whether I like weaving before I bought some high-dollar, fancy loom (yep, I do.) This a great toy loom. As far as I can tell, the basics are here and work pretty well. If I had children, I would be happy to give them this toy. I may give it to our granddaughter when I get a more serious type of loom. It's not terribly heavy-weight and sturdy, so it may not be suitable for more boisterous children."
4,a bumping Jam,back in 86 and 87 this was one of my Bumping Jams. Larry Blackmon nailed it with OWWLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah Yeah. this was the modernize Cameo funk that just didn't stop Grooving. still one of my jams when I put on a Cameo record. the vocals are tight.
3,Sophomore Slump,"The sequel to Lonely Hearts holds true to the curse of the ""sophomore slump."" After the crispness of the first book, something isn't quite as fresh here. Part of it may be that the criminals being pursued by the hero, Charlie Resnick, are burglars and mid-range drug dealers, instead of the serial killer of the previous book. What still holds one's attention, however, are the side stories in which the off-duty lives of the various police officers are given some play. Most interesting is the unflappable Super's paternal woes. Don't worry, the series picks up after this one."
3,A Description...,"From Back Cover:Things have started to get seriously out of hand for kind-hearted burglar Jerry Grabianski. His violent, opportunistic partner-in-crime, Trevor Grice, is uncontrollable. And now Jerry has fallen hard for married, love-starved and willing Maria Roy - whom he and Trevor met while ransacking her house.Detective Inspector Charlie Resnick is certain that the criminals responsible for the break-in at the Roy household are the same two who left a corpse behind during their previous caper. But there are some things neigher Maria nor her television director husband Harold are reveaing to the melancholy investigator. And when love, lies and larceny mix, the result can be murder."
2,"Great drive, great design, bad price, horrible noise.","I have another external LaCie drive and it's been running great and nearly silently for nearly two years of heavy, always-on use. Being a fan of both Legos and copious amounts of HDD storage I picked up this drive. what a mistake!It's neat looking, and the drive itself works fine but the pricetag is much more than it's non-lego shaped peers and the fan in this case sounds like a blender full of ball bearings and bumble bees set to puree.I would suggest ditching the cool lego shape, save some money, and get a drive that won't wake up the neighbors."
5,Jello Custard,"After looking EVERYWHERE for this yummy custard and not being able to find it in the stores, I was pleasantly surprised to find it here. We have been eating custard frequently now and the kids love it. I would suggest the stove method because the microwave method, while it saves time, just does not taste as good. So glad to find it and have it shipped so quickly. I would recommend this product and seller for sure."
5,Anyone have old Flan recipe from Amer Egg Custard box???,"The American Egg Custard had a recipe for flan on the box. When they quit printing therecipe, I lost my copy. I called the company several years later and they no longer hadthe recipe, either, since the were selling the boxes of flan. I prefer the original recipe on their box to the pre-boxed ""flan"". Does anyone have the recipe (probably from 15 or 20 years ago)."
3,Custard Pudding,"Don't you miss that custard that your mother used to make? I don't know why stores stopped carrying it, but now you can buy it on line. I need to order again as I share it with my extended family."
5,I love this product!!!,Order arrived on time (sooner than expected).This item is hard to find in grocery stores. Now I am set for several months!!
5,Old Time European Quality,"My son, who is now 4, wasn't into this kind of toys and I thought it was just a waste of money, but his 18 months old brother was absolutly delighted when he found it in the closet. It's one of his favorite toys now. This wooden stacker is made in Sweden in the same way it used to be made a hundred years ago and if nothing else it will teach your child to appreciate real, quality things in life."
1,price went up in one day!,"I put this item in my cart yesterday at 7.99, today when i went to purchase my order the price went up to 19.99! obviously i'm not buying it now. this happened to a few more items but not at this much of an increase. Shoppers beware."
2,"Sea-going ""Grand Hotel""","This book was a fast read, but ultimately not that enjoyable. The characters were shallow and not well-drawn, the situations they get involved in strongly contrived and not very involving. The concept is sort of like a ""Grand Hotel"" on the high seas, but the author falls short of his goal."
1,This blade should NOT have the dewalt name on it - it TERRIBLE !!!!,"So, i have the dewalt 18v cordless saw w/ lithium batteries, brand new... i made a few 2x4 cuts and some 1/2-inch ply wood cuts and this blade started smoking the wood... it a terrible blade. I was looking for a replacement here on amazon. I found the Freud 24tooth blade for $10 shipped w/ amazon prime... WOW - the Freud Blade is AMAZING.... Do not waste your money with this dewalt saw blade....I can't believe dewalt has made such a horrible product with their name on it... I know its the blade that came with the saw, and its the starter blade... but to only make a few cuts is terrible!!!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS BLADE"
3,"a saw blade should cut. Like other brands, this one also cuts","Not much one can say about a saw blade. It either works or doesn't. The one I purchased worked - however, not particularly better or worse than what it replaced."
4,Good read,Considerably better than average for the genre. Shana Galliher runs across her best friend being used sexualy on a web site and hires a recovery firm to help get her loose. Shana must undergo training in the dark world of BDSM so she can aid in recoverig her friend. Lots of good errotic scenes as her agent Ranger (sounds like a dog) trains her and a little humor. The plot is decent as well. Good trining scenes and ending.
4,A Book Worth Reading,"While not the best BDSM book I've ever read, it is worth reading. The Scarlet Cavern is a BDSM club that films and shows clips online, which is where the heroine, Shana, sees her friend. Thinking that she's there against her will, Shana hires Recovery, a firm reknown for doing whatever it took to help people regain something or someone they've lost. Her case is assigned to Ranger, an enigmatic operative, who agrees to help Shana gain entrance to the elite, private club. But to gain access, Shana must learn to be a sub, and Ranger is just the man to teach her.Shana is a great heroine, strong enough to take whatever she has to, in order to help her friend. And Ranger is the kind of hero that's dominant enough to be sexy, but has the soft-heart that makes you love him."
1,unstable,"overpriced and unpredictable. dont waste your money. look for a better solution for your storage needs. not sure if it is overheating, but it just stops responding in the middle of a large copy. came formatted for mac."
3,It's ok but needs work,"I have the 1TB version of this drive, it is ok... the biggest problem I have is that when I plug it into my mac it shows a smaller un-initialized drive that the tech support told me was internal storage to support the different configurations the drive can do. That's all fine and dandy, but I would prefer not to see it every time I plug the drive it. I have had no problems with lock ups, it is quieter than other drives I have seen."
1,2 dead 500GB LaCie drives are enough!,I have had two separate 500GB LaCie external Hard Drives as back ups and they both have crashed. One was in warranty and replaced by LaCie with another which crashed out of warranty. Sorry LaCie you've list my confidence and business!
5,Great collection and performances,"I have gotten to the point where I prefer Naxos CDs. The cost is actually a minor factor, I know that I can trust Naxos to provide a quality performance and sound. This collection of gems of overtures is thrilling from start to finish. The music might be considered lightweight by some but most of the composers on this CD tried purposfully to make music that was appealling and tuneful. Highly recommended."
5,Mac is in excellent form,"This is yet another great solo release from Bunnymen Ian McCulloch. Solid lyrics and catchy hooks guarantee a great number of repeat listenings with several awesome tracks in the offerings- better than Mysterio, ranks up there with other delightful masterpieces from this prolific and multi-talented post punk God. Also highly recommend the import single accoustic version of Sliding, which includes the rare ""Planet Song."" A++++Slideling 2"
3,Good...,"This is a good little book if you are just wondering what reflexology really IS. Not very detailed on HOW to do it, but a nice book if you are just wanting to learn more about it..P.S. When it says it's little, it is a very small book."
1,No support,Does not support Vista 64-bit. I bought this at a retail store and the box says supports windows vista. I get the product home only to find out it does not support 64-bit vistas which is not on the box any where. Also if you need support over the phone its 24.95 the first 10 minutes and then a certain dollar amount for every minute after that. Doesn't look like a very good company.
1,Poor implementation,"I purchased Perfect Image 12 almost 2 years ago, with the intent of using it. I didn't have an opportunity to use it until just recently, when I wanted to install an SSD in my laptop. Perfect Image did a quick job of backing up the partition, even though the interface was a bit complicated to navigate. I backed up the partition to an external 500GB hard drive, installed the SSD, put windows 7 on it(to be able to install the Perfect Image software) and ran the software. It rebooted into a DOS program and started to restore. This was at 9 PM, and I went to bed. When I got up the next morning ~530AM, it was still running, about 50% done and over 8 hours later. Needless to say, I was not impressed. I ended up doing a fresh install all the way."
1,BE CAREFULL....,"This software looks to be a pre windows-7, and pre 64-bit version...THIS IS A CHEEP SELL OFF OF OBSOLETE SOFTWARE... $9.99 WOULD BE A FAIR PRICE."
2,Perfect image,Way too much for Vista. Slows everything down and took 13 hours in safe mode to do total backup.
1,Does not support 64 bit,"I have 64 bit Vista. Looked on the Amazon and Avanquest website, neither stated that the product does not support 64 bit.After it did not load, I called Avanquest and they told me it does not support 64 bit and they did not know when it will or if it ever will."
2,ok,the product is more for back ups than copying files. it couldnt even accomplish a simple task or migrating files to a new hardrive it crashed it and corrupted everything instead.i would recommend it for back ups only not for files migration.
1,"Photos don't look good on Kindle, why release the book there?",May be it's just because I got the book on Kindle but the photographs don't look nice at all on Kindle so why release a Kindle edition of a book in the photo category?
5,a throughly well written book!!!,this booktotally captured my attention and got me completely engrossed in it . i didn't feel the pages turning at all.i read this book for college and i did in no way find it a chore to do so.i found myself waiting untill i could pick up the book to continue reading. well written.
5,He led a very interesting life.,"He said it himself, ""my life is far more interesting than my photographs."" I can't argue with that, and the book is a fascinating read. Additionally, reading this book has given me a much greater understanding of his art and why he was such a master. I revisited his work after reading much of it, and I'm glad I did. I'm about 1/2 way through it, and then plan to read Patti Smith's book, Just Kids."
1,Mapplethrope by Morrisroe,"The book that I ordered and arrived was a reprint, not the original edition, which is hardcover. More importantly, the original black and white illustrations were grayed out (no contrast) in the reprint edition. The description did not say it was a reprint!!!!"
1,expensive,$26.30 per tile is extremely expensive. You would do better to purchase drywall over and again. I don't know how this company stays in business.
3,Fine Figs,"These are perfectly good black figs. Nothing special one way or another. If you like this kind of figs, you won't be unhappy. They are (not in a bad way) perhaps a little more moist than I sometimes see in this variety or dried fig. If you order from this seller, be aware that their shipping costs are high and extremely high if you order just one or two items - making it not worth buying anything unless you buy quite a few things at once."
2,Combo Pack okay for price,"Very low price put low quality as well. As long as you expect it, it's worth the purchase. The pouch's belt clip covering didn't hold up too well, but I liked the style. The charger works fine. The earpiece is good for me. I rarely use it, and only in my car, so comfort and quality was not a major factor."
3,"It's ok, but not useful","The earphone is ok, it works. But the other two are useless. It looks like they are used."
3,Like most of Kushner's books,"Honey from the Rock has a great deal of heart, but little in the way of strong content. Part of this is purposeful. Kushner is attempting to reach a wide audience with his work, and so must reduce or distill the work to a common denominator. The unfortunate effect is a further devaluing of the kabbalah, and yet another work that takes it further from the roots which nourish it: halakic Judaism.But it is hard to find absolute fault with this work. Kushner expounds the great mystical maxim: everything is one. The supposed separation of things in the world is a false perception. This is a powerful message, no matter how delivered. And it is within the reach of everyone."
5,Must-Have CD Set for Students of Mysticism & Planetary Healing,"Reb. Cooper is a learned and personable teacher with decades of study and experience. This 6 CD set is a gift to yourself, with many layers of learning through stories (midrash), guided meditations, and intentional music (nigun). Reb. Cooper's teachings can bless and change your life if you let them."
5,Insight Guides,"I have found these set of books the best for the kind of traveling I have been doing. Although I wish they were lighter to be taken on daily excursions and the plane, you will get to where you need to be. The next one on Greece would have been coming out too late for my trip, but the last one is just fime. Most everything is still where it was before."
1,pissed,I would love to give a review on this product but have not yet received it!!! I e-mailed you guys about this but have not heard from you either!!!! Need I go on?? Very dissatisfied to this point. Can't get a response from the guys I bought from or from you.
3,Dissapointed-,"I have been developing server applications for some time and I was really dissappointed in this book. This book is for freshers, for people who want to start programming server applications and who have not done it before. If you are an experienced server guy, stay away from this book, except for the last part of the book which deals with security most of the other sections I knew in detail.But Still I give it three starts because, I wish this book had been released when I started to learn server programming and this book would have saved me lot of time and relieved me a lot of searching.I still love Jeffery Richter's books, I use Advanced Windows every day and basically is a bible to me."
3,Programming Server-Side Applications for Microsoft Windows 2,This book is not very good for freshers.One should be familiar to COM/DCOM for reading this book.
4,Movie download,"I hadn't seen this movie in many years and had a desire to watch it.It was a good movie, worth watching again after all these years."
2,Poor quality,The sound track was horrible - could barely hear the dialog while the special effects and music were extremely loud. A lot of the scenes were very dark. Did not hold up as well as I remember the original.
1,Riveting scenes of an escalator going up and down,"I have read other reviews of this movie and clearly I am the slow kid in the class because I was unable to discern just exactly what this film was about. It has a cool title, and who doesn't love a good 70s political thriller, but this movie just wanders all over the place. It moves at a pace that goes barely fast enough so that you keep watching, but never actually gets you excited. And they used so much film to accomplish this!"
4,Really good but with unintended consequence?,"I was trying to think how to describe The Parallax View and I realized its the conspricy movie Oliver Stone would make if he had more talent and less ego.Since that won't happen we're left with Parallax View which is a series of events that vaguely correspond to actual occurances. The point is not to theroize about an actual asasination; its to show how a fictional conspricy might unfold.Alas, the unintended consequence is all the single bullet/talk radio/grassy knoll nuts attaching undue importance to it. May I remind you that our current government--as sinister as any I can recall--can't even fake WMDs? How would people like this create a Parallax Corporation?"
4,NOT SURE WHAT BEATTY WAS SHOOTING FOR,"""The Parallax View"" was big liberal Warren Beatty's attempt to describe a conspiracy involving shadowy government agencies. It is entertaining and worth watching, but misses the mark. Beatty seems to be trying to piece together an explanation on how, or even who, killed Kennedy. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" may have inspired him. Beatty plays a journalist who goes undercover, allowing himself to be recruited by the Parallax Corporation, presumably a CIA front that trains assassins. His psychological profile is determined in part by watching a disturbing montage of scenes, ranging from love, sex and patriotism to war, gore and devil worship, mixed with the juxtaposition of wealth vs. need. The point seems to be that people go hungry while rich America has sex and kills people?"
2,Dated and dull,"The Bottom Line:I imagine that when The Parallax View was released the post-Watergate sense of paranoia obscured the film's many flaws, but viewed today it's a boring thriller with a dull Beatty in the lead that's chockablock with plot holes and contrivances leading up to an ending that's supposed to be poignant but comes across as ludicrous; skip this dated thriller and watch The Manchurian Candidate instead.2/4"
4,"Intense, creepy thriller.","The Parallax View is chilling. The DVD presentation is great visually, but the sound is quite variable throughout, meaning that when it's loud, it's really loud, and when it's soft, it's really soft. Constant running back and forth to the volume controls. Probably the worst sound on any DVD I own. However, the quality of the movie is such that I can overlook this problem. Makes me wary of Paramount's DVD releases, though. No supplements, no actor bios or anything like that, either."
1,Did not work,"The SELLER is not to blame! I have read reviews from others that the sellers are selling discs that are defective. This is not what is happening. When I realized the discs I bought (TDK, sony, Maxell and others)were not recording I called my recorder manufacturer to see if they could help solve this problem,I was told that the disc MANUFACTURERS were the reason for this problem. For whatever reason, the manufacturers have changed the way the discs are being made and many of them do not record on different recorders. Therefore, they did give me the names of some of the discs they had tried on the recorders. I ordered what I could not find in stores and now have a collection of over 200 blank DVDs that I cannot record on. Thank God that Amazon still sells VHS tapes."
1,beware,Beware of this company because they are selling knockoffs of the xm cassette tapes. They are misleading customers to belive that they are selling the orginal xm cassette adapter and they are making a profit off of their dishonesty. Do not buy this product!!!!!!
5,SkyFi Vheicle Adapter,Product works well and was easy to install in my vehicle. This allows me to use my SkyFi XM radio receiver in an additional vehicle plus at home.
4,It is what it said it is work fine.,"It is what it says it is, it's just like the ones I got with my unit. Its a good deal if you need one."
3,Darn Glue,"This item shipped quickly by the seller and was packaged great. The item was easy to install and works great. But...The dock falls off pretty easily. The sticky side of the dock itself and the vehicle mount don't stay together. I installed it during the winter and didn't experience any problems, but now that it's warming up, the thing is in the floor of my car when I get off work. I expect the problem to worsen when it's mid-summer and my car gets up to 100 degrees inside.I think I will try to find a windshield mount instead. Darn."
5,Delphi kit,Delphi SA10102 SKYFi2 Vehicle Adapter KitKit works good but it would be better if it was hard wired to FM.
1,"Substandard, old product",This product should be removed from the market. XM came out with a much better car kit that actually works.
5,One of the Best 80s Christian Rock Albums!,"As a huge Whitecross fan, I think this is the best album. Awesome guitar, big drums and awesome lyrics. If you like the sound of bands like Ratt and Whitesnake and awesome 80's melodic guitar, this is the perfect album. I have most of their other albums, and this is the best one musically in my opinion, for 80's hard rock."
3,Frustrating in places,"I found this book a little frustrating. Just as you begin to get into it, the author changes point of view to another character and you have to begin over. I would have preferred it if he had stuck with Julia or Keverin. Shelim's story is kind of interesting too. Overall it was okay, but as other reviewers have pointed out, the author did a much better job with book one."
1,Average and boring,"Most readers will be able to skip this book and their lives will be just as rich. The writing is amatuerish and the plot is a rehash of other stories that seem all to familiar. I generally try to find something good to say in each book I read, but I found that I was having a difficult time doing so here.Go to the library or better yet pick up one of Terry Brooks books or Robert Jordan which are far more original. This is a clearly derivative work (I'm being generous."
1,Give yourself a break and don't buy it,"Having read the first two books in this series, I hung in there hoping things might get better---they didn't. The writing is so poor I found myself wondering how this book got published in the first place.Basically, I found the plot contrived and unbelievable. The dialogue and imagery were equally as bed. It may be time for Mr. Cooper to consider looking for another career."
2,Ho Hum,"While it would be unfair to say that this book wasn't somewhat enjoyable, I was definitely not bowled over by it. The author still needs to work on his writing skills as there are some really awkward phrases and sentences that brought me up short, but overall it was a reasonable, if undistinguished effort."
4,Very satisfying,"This latest in Julia Morton's story continues almost from where The Power That Binds left off. Julia had been abducted from the capital of Deva by the sorcerer Demophon, but Julia's coming has been eagerly awaited by Shamen of the Camorin Clans. When Demophon attempts to take her north to General Navarien, his company is attacked by the clansmen and Julia taken from him. Julia decides to stay with the clans and help them against Navarien when he begins to march south.This book is somewhat shorter and slower paced than the previous two. It has less politics than the second book, and more action. There's quite a lot more about the clans and other countries of Waipara too. All in all, I enjoyed it."
2,Very disappointing,"I really enjoyed the first book in the series, almost made it through the second and wish I'd never wasted my money on the third. There are two more coming out -- maybe I'll check them out of the local library. The author must have rushed to get this book done because it is very sloppily written - many word syntax errors, and many poorly written sentences. If you still want to read it, borrow it from someone. Better yet, I'll give you mine! I couldn't even finish reading it."
5,Excellent story,"I give this five stars because although this is book 3 of a five book series, it doesn't suffer from what I call ""middle book syndrome"" You know what I mean... the first book usually sets up the plot, the second is full of action, the third nearly always just marches in place until the fourth one comes along. Thankfully that doesn't happen in this series. Each book has a beginning, middle, and end. So although they should be read in order, none of them are simple placeholders. All of them progress the story.I'm looking forward to Dragon's Dawn--book four of this series."
3,1993 Please...,"What's up with the description glitch? Those in the 9021""know"" are well aware that the gang at West Bev. tossed their blue caps in 1993, not 1990. That would make them older than I am, & it's just not true in the world of Aaron Spelling. (Sadly, many of the actors are much older in reality...). The lastest rumor I heard for postponing the series release on DVD is that in order to do so, they must re-purchase the rights to the music from the episodes, and as we all know, many, many bands were featured throughout the 10 year run (not to mention all the great background music from the Peach Pit jukebox). C'est la vie...for now we must watch our beat up VHS tapes with missing episodes and wait for the glorious day when we can ""call in sick"" for a week and watch the series as it was intended...non-stop on DVD!p.s. I gave this a 3-star rating only b/c I'm miffed at waiting so long for the DVD series."
1,90210 big fan!,i want to buy this video but with some of the reviews ive seen im not sure if i still want to. but i was young when the show started so i never watched it untill about the begining of 2004. see i really think luke perry (dylan mckay) is so hot so i started watching it and my dad records it every week day and on sat and sun. i love it so much! i wish they would come out with all the DVDS! season 1/10 cuz i would buy them all. i need to catch up with the early days.
2,Could be better,"I'm a huge fan of 90210. If this was out on video and people bought it,they need to see it in reruns. The stuff they edited out is very important-they should keep it in the true form it was aired in. THEY NEED TO PUT 90210 ON DVD!!! ALL TEN SEASONS!!! It will be a great seller!! I know I would buy them!! I watch the reruns on Fx as much as I can."
1,DVDs a MUST,I am giving this one star ONLY because it is on VHS and not DVD. I don't even own a VCR anymore and had to watch it at someone elses house!! The day that they come out with all ten seasons on DVD I will buy them all and really wish I could now! I just bought the pilot episode on DVD and am hoping that this will sell well and that they'll go on to put all the seasons on DVD already. I know there is still a huge worldwide fan base who would purchse them!!!
2,A hacked-up version of the OAV series,"People often seem to have the same general reaction to the Armitage III movie when watching it: great animation, great concept, but a very jumpy and confusing storyline. The reason for this is simple: the movie was pieced together from four one-hour OAV episodes! If you want to see a MUCH easier to comprehend plot, get your hands on a fansubbed copy of the OAVs (you'll also avoid the hideous dubbed voice acting that way)."
2,"Naomi is one of my heroes, BUT","Polymatrix is a movie version of the OVA. While it's fun to look at, there is too much taken out of the original series. Yes, it still makes sense for the most part, but the relationship building between Naomi and Ross is not as strong, Jean Claude's motives don't seem to make as much sense, and the true bitterness Ross feels about robots isn't as telling in this film.My biggest grlpe is the voice actors. Elizabeth Berkeley and Keifer Sutherland give the most deadpan and lifeless performances that it really sucks the magic out of the characters.The OVA is far superior to this release."
2,not worth the dough,"In this anime, people just have a problem getting along with the semi-humans (called thirds) they create. Armitage, a third herself, is a bounty hunter after a psycho bent on murdering the thirds. So begins the struggle against human and third, and of course, there's the classic and generic ""I wonder what it's like to be human...."" internal struggle. The story starts off promisingly, but it eventually lags to the point where I was left uninterested as to what would happen next. It tends to jump around a bit, though this movie supposedly smoothens out the gaps from the OAV series. The dubbing is above average though, as it seems there were some high-profile talents hired for the voice-overs. It's surprisingly lacking in action and doesn't have much of a soundtrack to intensify anything. I'd recommend seeing it if you're a fan of cyborg-ish anime, a la Ghost in the Shell, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend buying it."
4,A staple Anime!,"there isn't much i can say about this movie except it was outstanding! It is often hard to find a good anime that you can wacth more than three times, but this movie has a certain quality which makes it last. Although the voices arn't great (naomi)you do get used to them after a while and actually start to like them. The villan was greatly developed and wasn't just the typical ""i want to rule the world"" bad guy. And you never have to wait for good action scenes. however, I wouldn't reccomend this flim to people just getting into anime (quite a bit of nudity and very graphic violence). This movie is a must have for any serious anime collection."
4,Cool Flick,"Awsome storyline, cool soundtrack (especially with surround sound), and generally one of the best animes. Buy it, you'll like it."
2,"Eye candy, but nothing more...","While I can see what the writer(s) were trying to go for with this film, I can also see that they did not even come near to achieving it. First, the storyline is nearly incoherent, jumping around far too quickly. Also, the characters are not particularly well developed. They are simply unable to express any subtlety of emotion, the only anything is ever developed is by blatent, and boring, statement of fact. In my opinion, this film's only saving grace its its artful directing and style."
5,The best movie ever,I thought ArmitageIII was awsome. The setting takes place on Mars where a guy named Ross goes to work there as a cop. His partner turns out to be Naomi Armitage whose a Third.Thirds are robots that are made to be like humans in everysingle way even in giving birth. Amirtage tries to protect the Thirds cause people are trying to destroy them. Ross soon finds out Armitage is a third and tries to help her out to. The movie is a got to see.
1,HAHAHA!!!,"I like anime, I think. Quite a bit. And this, I have to say, was just about the worst one I've ever seen. The story itself is fairly ludicrous, with more than a bit of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (that's Blade Runner to you uncultured savages) influence, but much worse. The best bits are the voice acting and the script, however. Ordinarily I can't stand dubbed anime, but here the dubbing really helped, taking a film that would ordinarily just have been insipid and boring, and turning it into a film that was utterly, if unintentionally, hilarious. The acting was bad...very, very bad--not that the ""actors"" exactly had the best material to work with. I'm utterly astounded by all the high ratings. Apparently, this is the only anime many people have seen. Priceless, in a manner of speaking."
3,it's good but is not enough,"I'm a graphic designer, and the law for any graphic designer is the image talks and the first look matters, I see the quality of animation is average, the plot is interesting, the ""chara"" have something interesting, but when I saw it don't stick me enough, sorry for the people that enjoy this movie, usually I bought the movies that recommend Guilles Portrais, and in his list this movie don't appears. I heard good comments about this but as I told: it's good but is not enough."
3,"Relies on suped up action scenes, nothing else","On Mars, in the year 2179, humanoid robots called Seconds populate the planet and start to run amok. They are hunted by tough chick Naomi Armitage and her partner Ross Sylibus. Fast paced Blade Runner clone starts off well, grabbing you with its hyperkinetic scenes of action, but soon it becomes apparent that the movie has no story - and no point. This barely saw theatrical release in the US (though it is certainly more than some Manga movies get). Hollywood actors Kiefer Sutherland and Elizabeth Berkley provide the commendable voices of the two leads, which gives this movie its only pizzazz."
3,"Great anime, but too much was cut from the OAVs","I had rented the first volume of the original Armitage III series several years ago, and fell in love with this series. I purchased ""Polymatrix"" this summer, and was a little dissappointed by how much was cut from the original series. Since then I have purchased the original 4-volume series (30 minutes each, except for volume 1, which is 50 minutes). After watching the original four volumes, I can say without hesitation that they are far superior to the condensed and redubbed motion picture version. If you watched this movie and found the story and plot a little confusing, get the original volumes instead; you will enjoy this great series much more if you do!"
1,What a disappointment,"Why did they do this? Armitage III the series was a 4 part classic, relatively low-key, release from Pioneer. Featuring one 50-minute episode and 3 thirty minute episodes it told the story of Armitage, a robot trying to help other Third types in a future Mars colony. But, the series was hacked up and assembled into this shambles of a movie featuring dire voice-overs by Kiether Sutherland (who is a good actor) and Elizabeth Berkley (who is not). Neither actor or actress seemed to give much of an effort and the original series, with it's increased length and full scenes and low-key voice actors give Armitage a much better run.Alas, it is virtually impossible to find."
3,Commpressing three hours down to one and a half!,"I have been into Anime for the past six years, when Armitage III was first came out it was four tapes running apx. 45 min. each. The story was full and compleat and left you with a few questions.In 1996 I attended Anime-Expo '97 the largest Con of its type in the US. It was here that I saw the premer of ""Armitage III Poly-Matrix"". I was very disapointed with it, they cut 45 min. out of the origanl film making the plot even more diffaclt to understand. And changed the ending leaving it open which made you think ""There is more right?!?"".If you can find the older VHS tapes I would recommend that you pick them up.These are just my feeling about the movie and nothing more.Otaku 4 Life."
4,"A Beautiful, Breathtaking, Thought-provoking Film!","This film is created from the Armitage III OAV series, and the cuts are occasionally apparent, but only to the highly-attentive eye. There is so much happening visually and aurally, with narrative conflicts and twists, plus changing political tides and intense philosophical issues - all of which truly tax the mind in a great way. The only drawbacks to the DVD version of the film are: 1.) the lack of a Japanese-language version, and 2.) the corny sounds attached to virtually all menu selections. However, once the film begins, the experience will leave any spectator in extreme awe of the power of (Japanese) animation."
1,What a disappointment,"What a let down - such wonderful music in the movie - most of it, the reason I wanted to buy the soundtrack - is not on the soundtrack!"
2,Left the good stuff out,"This movie had a great soundtrack, but they left most of the actual soundtrack out. Half of the songs they included on this CD I'm not even sure were in the movie. The great music that I enjoyed in the theater is not on this CD. :-("
1,Who made the decision for this soundtrack?,"Loved the movie, but all of the key songs from the movie are not present on this soundtrack. Someday, Ooh Child and Why Can't We Be Friends were integral in the film but instead Disney omits them in favor of tracks from Miley Cyrus and Hayden Panetierre? Give me a break. Shame on Disney for this soundtrack. Clearly a corporate decision to cater to what ""they think"" makes a good soundtrack. They haven't got a clue."
2,Disney doesn't do soundtracks,"This is not the first time that the Disney Corporation has blown a soundtrack. I really think that they don't know how to do a good soundtrack anymore. They seem so concerned about making it palatable to the tweens that they forget that they paid someone good money to actually write a background score. All they seem concerned about is including some pop tunes because they must think this sells soundtracks. Well, if anyone is listening out there in the world of Disney - people who collect soundtracks would have liked to have gotten one for this movie. There are about 74 minutes available on a CD - why not go ahead and fill them with both the pop stuff and the actual score. Disney either forgets the score (like they did for this movie) - or only includes a paltry amount (maybe 30-40 minutes). Somebody at Disney better wake up - and maybe release a complete score for this movie - otherwise, you're better off skipping this mess."
5,Disney's Bridge To Terabithia,This is a great soundtrck it's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
3,A Novel Not Based on The Show,"I am writing this review to let people know about this rip-off. I mean I have been a fan of One Tree Hill since the very first episode and have watch both seasons of the show. This book got three stars because I like learning more about Brooke and getting an insight into her world. HOWEVER, there is one major flaw to this book. This author totally wreck the book by changing events that happen on the tv show during the second season. I couldn't believe the alterations done to this book. These alterations include Brooke relationship with Felix, Haley leaving with Chris to pursude a music career, and even the incident with Lucas letter to Brooke and Peyton was changed. For those of you who watch the show I would not recommend getting this book unless you are a died hard fan. Those of you who haven't watch the show I would recommend getting the book."
5,LOVE IT!,This book was great! I loved how they show Brookes thoughts and feelings.It has great detail. I could read this book agian and agian!
1,You Can Do Better Than This!,"Another release of unremastered Australian recordings, you can do much better. I highly recommend ""Brilliant From Birth"", as it contains over sixty songs (remastered) and a great 'notes' package. It's here at Amazon.com!"
2,Not as good a selection of early BGs in other compilations,"Brilliant From Birth and To Be or Not to Be have many of the same items, but with other selections more indicative of their future styles."
1,"Listen, rinse, repeat...","Guys, Starcastle can only be properly appreciated when framed by the appropriate accoutrements. It's a four step process:1. Light some strawberry incense swiped from the secret stash in your sister's sock drawer.2. Load the short stack of Starcastle LPs onto the BSR/McDonald record changer.3. Crack open a pink Champale.4. Fire up a hookah bowl packed with oregano.Now you're totally kickin' it the Starcastle way. Heck, even your mom won't mind..."
1,No to YES and Starcastle,"When I was in college in the late 70's & early 80's, I thought YES was a little intimidating with their oblique and sometimes strange imagery...so of course Starcastle came along; sort of like a musical 'Yes for Dummies' so I of course liked their music right away...except after a while they really just did sound a lot like they were trying to be YES without the oblique and sometimes strange imagery. So I quit listening to Starcastle and YES and started listening to fusion...which has no imagery at all and usually no words to muck up the beat."
4,yes,EMULATORS:YES! INTERESTING LISTEN: YES! SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE WE KNOW: YES! GREAT MUSICIANSHIP: YES! SOPHISTICATED LADY WITH YOUR BLUE JEANS ON UP TWO OCTAVES: YES! GREAT SQUIRE INFLUENCED BASS: YES!
3,Good for being written by outsiders,"As former member of ISKCON (12 years - 7 in New Vrindaban), this book was a disturbing catch up on things. I give them a lot of credit for getting names and details right but the writers TOTALLY missed the language and style of the movement. It is an outsider's take but I'm amazed they were able to unearth so much dirt from such an opaque community. Just sayin' ... I could do better ... but don't hold your breath."
2,a bias story,"ISKCON is not a cult. it's sad that the organisation is continuously getting beat up for the mistakes of a few. people have it in for Hare Krishna's. There are so many positive things that go on. it is a branch of hinduism. Hare Krishna's are vaishnava hindus. This story is written by someone who is on the outside. every religion has its problems. This story takes a leader who went a little crazy with power. Drug smuggling, molestation etc. did occur and cannot be denied. however this book capitalises on a scandal in a religious sect. Read the story for some sort of twisted enjoyment but it has no real insight and gives a group who is trying its best to overcome the mistakes of a few in order to lead good religious lives a bad name."
4,REALLY GOOD!,"This book is unbelievably entertaining! My boyfriend and I read it out loud to each other, and couldn't wait to hear more! Unbelievable that all of what happened was going on. The true life characters came to life and this was well-written for a true crime book. It was very interesting! If anyone has other recommendations to books on similar topics and from this era, message me! I love reading about the 60s, early 70s, weird and/or counterculture stuff and CULTS!"
5,Oregon Coast pattern,"I have just completed the Oregon Coast pattern from this book & love it!!!!! I will definitely have to make more afghans from this book. Although the book says the patterns take 16 hours to complete, mine took 23. But, I also have to mention that the fastest I've ever created an afghan before was 1 1/2 months! So, I think that these are absolutely wonderful patterns! I have & do recommend this book."
1,Very unhappy,This book was ordered on 3/30/2011 from The Best Book Source. I never received the book. I was charged for it. Very unhappy with this merchant. I will never order from them again. Gypsi
4,The Pogue one of the best Irish bands ever!!!!!,"This CD is outstanding the Pogues are a great band. Upbeat and totally unique sound. I highly recommend buying this cd, you won't reget it."
4,a must have!,"what a band. what an album. If you bought the first collection, then you have to have this. If you didn't well then maybe you need stop reading this and order it, run to someone's house who has it or get yourself a large can of guinness and pretend you have it. Get it and enjoy..."
2,buttcrackbuttcrackbuttcrackbuttcrack(& say it 8 more times),"Starts off about two room mates, some country boy and a fat idiot. Appearently the hick and his girlfriend are sick of looking at the mongloids buttcrack. But he dies and his voodoo sister ressurects him back to life as a buttcrack zombie to seek revenge on the hick and his girlfriend. If anyone looks at his booty, they turn into zombies. So some priest goes nuts and kills them all and the voodoo chick.The movie doesn't really have too much zombie action or even zombies if it is what you are expecting. However the movie was very entertaining in it's own way even though I gave it 2 stars (they're TROMA, what'd you expect). Hardly any gore, a dumb plot, DVD has a billion of extras, still worth a purchase at a reasonable price."
2,Buttcrack Zombies? We've Got 'Em!,"This movie dares you to watch it. It revolves around a mentally slow fat guy who always shows loads of offensive buttcrack. There is an evil redneck and girlfriend duo, who after Buttcrack dies are haunted by the Buttcrack zombie thanks to a voodoo priestess. If anyone sees the buttcrack of death, they will become a zombie, too (obviously). Eventually a priest gets involved and resolves everything back to some semblance of normality. Anyhow, I think I have all that right: honestly I was so bored I found it difficult to pay very close attention.I watched this movie somewhat against my will, so there exists a possibility that I was biased against it to begin with, but despite the entertaining title and premise (you have to admit that the concept of a buttcrack zombie is pretty funny) I didn't really find the film very funny or entertaining. I guess I am glad I can say I have seen it, but once is enough buttcrack for me."
1,Are you for real?????????,"Are you serious Jim Larsen??????? A buttcrack turning people into zombies? I thought I'd seen it all until I watched this god awful movie. Jim(Larsen) must be about 10 years old to think of such a plot. Maybe next we can have killer poop from outspace or some dumb crap like that. Hey maybe I just came up with the next horror/comedy movie.Is there really any point to this film? No there isn't. It is without a doubt the dumbest thing and dumbest movie I've ever seen. Just save your time and money. This movie is unintelligent, dull and boring. If this movie interests you, go watch your own buttcrack for 90 minutes and you'll save some money."
5,Possibly the best book on eating... ever,"If you love food, this book will make you laugh out loud. Trillin's delight in food is infectuous, and he's a damn good writer besides."
4,bonne état,trés bon état du livre reu à la période prévue. Intéressant et en rapport avec mes recherches sur le thème culinaire
5,Fascinating food reviews!,"This three-book collection by Calvin Trillin always makes me smile as I see the life of a ""foodie"" and recognize some of my own strong preferences for the exactly right combination of a dish or meal. Humorous and informative."
3,trillin but....,amusing but not as clever or bitingly witty as Traveling with Alice. Trillin is a great food writer but at times he needs to edit himself. His shorter works are more entertaining
2,Brilliant prose by a self-involved silly man,It's always embarrassing to read the thoughts of old adolescents.
2,bird watching boredom,"ugh, this book was painful to read. I enjoyed the passages on teenage life and living within a chaotic family but I was bored to death with his accounts of Munich and the bird watching. I have really enjoyed Franzen's other books but to actually peak into his life is just depressing. The guy has one shot at a memoir and I feel like he blew it. bird watching? jeesh."
1,Need to Know - These are Essays,"I had not realised this book was a series of essays until after I'd given up trying to make sense of it. It doesn't mention this on the book cover or back so I read it (or half of it) thinking it was a continuous story.The 1st essay ""House for Sale"" i enjoyed. No cliched sentimentality in describing his feelings about clearing his mother's house afer her death; even while he knew that house had been his mothers ""novel"" in the sense of it having expressed her creativity.The snoopy Peanuts ""essay"" - well it had its moments but I felt mostly if you were not of that time and of those interests it didn't strike much of chord.""Centrally located"" is the ""essay"" that made me give up; at the point where diagrams are needed to explain to the reader what you're on about....I might borrow some other of his books to see if they are as good as others say but this example did not make me a fan."
1,Shady Business Practices,"I love Jonathan Franzen and have bought all of his books from Amazon without any problems, until this one. The book arrived and I immediately tore into it. I had just built up some momentum and was really turning the pages when, halfway through the first chapter I turned the page and the sentence just didn't carry over. I'd had some wine so I checked myself a couple times but it turns out I wasn't loaded. Instead, my copy is missing 33 pages and, when I flipped through, I found pages 55-eightsomething were repeated later in the book. I don't know if the publisher is just moving seconds over Amazon figuring they're less likely to be returned of if Amazon has made a terrible business decision. Regardless, I've now had two of these problems in a row when ordering from Amazon. The lesson being, keep the shipping box."
4,Enjoyable,"Always enjoy reading Franzen's books. Reminded me a lot of The Corrections, which I loved, and which must have been inspired by his own life."
3,The little things of Franzen.,"In ""Freedom"" and ""The corrections"" the author exposes strong models of life, whom are apted to superate the failure in economics of 2008 in according to Obama policy, considering the recent optimisme of experts as Krugman and Stiglitz.This particular analysis of those questions proposes for Usa socialistic forms whom are in fact a new opportunity for the people.In ""The discomfort zone"" Franzen talks about little particulars of his life, as the religious traditions, the bird-watching, which is a great passion for him, the history of love as young.It is an other immagine of this author, less formal and more related to the family and the friends."
1,Terrible book by a great writer,"This seems to be a very personal book to Mr. Franzen - so personal that he was better off keeping these thoughts to himself and not writing them down. The stories, as compiled, are supposed to rsemble a memoir. It actually seems more like an extremely disparate and disjointed book of random thoughts and musings on his childhood and adolescence. For an author who makes you feel the pain of his characters in his other books and stories, I felt no empathy for him. He comes off (to me) as an extremely self-obsessed, purposeful loner and selfish environmentalist.The book was very disappointing, perhaps because I expected so much from such a talent. Also, it is a borefest (see: birdwatching)."
3,Betweeen 3 and 4 stars,Mildly interesting collection of essays - mostly of Franzen growing up in a St. Louis area suburb. I found it entertaining. It's a minor collection. If you love Franzen's works - you will like this.
2,not thrilled,"I found this book to be very boring. I think part of it was that it is read by the author, who has a monotone voice. An actor may have brought it more to life."
3,For Franzen fans only,"The Discomfort Zone is honest, funny, insightful and nearly every sentence is a work of art; just what you would expect from a memoir written by Jonathan Franzen. However, despite his prodigious gifts as a writer, this personal history doesn't feel cohesive, is often aloof and it never feels like vital reading. It is an interesting if uneven glimpse into the mind and past of Franzen, but if you haven't read his work before, read The Corrections before this. For fans only."
4,VJ Log (as it was popularly known) a great reference,"I have always enjoyed using this book, in its various annual editions, and wish it was still available. It lists all radio and TV stations in the US and Canada in three sections: by city, frequency or channel, and call letters. (I had heard years ago that Mr. Jones -- who looked old in his back cover picture -- died.) Now, even though outdated, it is still a valuable reference for historical info about radio. I will be referring to my old copies soon to verify info for my South Florida Radio History website."
5,Great product,Bought this as a gift. They use it daily. The cast iron is much better quality than expected. Keep in mind that they're using a gas stove which is what this is designed for.
4,Review,I learned that caring for a cast iron wok involves additional steps to preserve it. There is an instruction sheet on how to season your new wok and then how to maintain it for furture usage which requires cleanning with the whisk that is included with the purchase. Regular soap & water is not suggested. So if you are not pressed for time then this may be a good choice for you if a cast iron wok is your preference. The food comes out great!
3,Still haven't used it so far,"I followed the directions to clean it but I still haven't used it yet because when I put it on the stove it smokes and stinks. It doesn't appear to have any residue on it except from when I greased it and heated it in the oven as per the directions. Trust me, I cleaned it well prior to greasing it up. I guess I'll try again and see what happens."
4,I am pleased,"The first wok I received was broken. However, The Wok Shop promptly sent me a replacement which is in good shape. I look forward to trying it out."
2,Still Trying to Get the Burned Marinating Sauce out of it :(,"Not a happy wokster. A previous reviewer talked about the base of it that sits over the flame being cheaply painted and the paint coming off and flying around during cooking. I should have listened, and that should have been the first clue not to waste my money on this junk. On the bright side, it may make a nice planter for a shady area if I drill some holes in the bottom of it."
3,Beautiful wok...,"but the ring that it sits on is aluminum and it actually started to burn on my gas stove's burner. Well, I have to be very careful now...but the wok itself and the 2 tools are great. Please correct the ring composition."
4,cool cut,"El Debarge is one of the most Expressionist Artist that i have ever heard. he truly puts alot of emotion&Feeling into his songs. vocally the cat is something else. this song was smooth. I dug how he used ""I Like It"" near the end of this song. El Debarge is a very underrated Artist."
4,Great Addition to Kindle Library,"The quality of the product was perfect for my use: to have a handy, portable, easily searchable classic work on my Kindle. It was free, too, so there's little to complain about. Unlike usual Shakespeare texts for class use, however, it is bare-bones script without any vocabulary notes or even a list of the characters. Once I obtained my own synopses and other reader aides online, I could read and enjoy a very well-known Shakespeare play, one that has two famous lines--""now is the winter of our discontent..."" and ""a horse! a horse! a kingdom for a horse!"" I will, as I have already done, go back to the free classics for my Kindle."
1,Missing scenes & end of play,"Bought this for a class at Boston College for my son-- he just notified me of missing pages, last scenes in the book."
4,a good edition,"I teach British Literature and find the price is right for my students, the book size is a bit too small, and the intoductory and closing notes and essay are very good."
4,Your sympathies please,"This is my favortie Shakespeare play, simply because Richard is so evil and so power hungry. You have to get under his skin in order to like it: something many people are afraid to do. If you are able to sympathize with evil desires, then this play promises many rewards."
1,Pages Missing !,"Reading this for my summer Shakespeare class and what do I discover? The book ends in the middle of Act V, Scene III ! It's missing the last two and a half scenes of the play! ARE YOU KIDDING ME ? Not ok."
3,For class,"The book was in fine condition. It had a name on the side though, and some very odd notes inside. But it was still in good condition besides those markings. I got it in remarkable time too. This was a last minute addition to the class I'm in and it showed up promptly so I didn't miss much."
2,Regular Barney Fare,"I can only repeat what other reviewers have said ....there is no menu, no subtitles for a hearing impaired family member.. you are forced to watch at least ten minutes of previews for other cartoons, absolutely no extra features or bonus clips....nothing.... Also the video itself seems rather standard....same songs as you would see on tv....silly hat and so forth....it seemed like a regular Barney episode from PBS....I wish I could return this one. Despite all of that it does hold my two years old attention as anything Barney would....so I gave it the two stars. I would pick up the VHS version of this particular one if you are set on having it."
5,Great example for toddlers,"I purchased this dvd for my little granddaughter who is 20 months old and just loves Barney. She learns so much from him . How to share, good manners,how to interact with other children.Barney is great for little people and a great preschool tool.I'm very pleased with my purchase."
2,Kid loves it BUT................,"Why the hell would you have a song on ice cream???Every time my 2 year old sees it, he wants us to get him ice cream. I thought this was so stupid on the part of the makers of the barney company.Why couldnt they sing a song on cucumber or veggies?"
2,VCD not DVD,"Great content but TERRIBLE DVD! It's like they recorded their video to a video CD! No chapter search, no menu, commercials to fast forward through!Lyric studios put out high quality Barney DVDs with all sorts of extras. ..."
2,Where's The Menu?,"My 2 year old girl is fascinated with this DVD, but there's no menu or special features. We're forced to watch commercials before the actual feature. A pain in the behind when she's screaming she wants to watch Barney. ..., excellent content, but no menu (?)"
3,Not Barney's quality,A simple episode.No DVD Special Features.No DVD Menu!!!!!!Hit Entertainment: Please use Lyrick's standards of quality.
3,"Good movie overall, but bad message about eating healthy foods","This movie is fine, and my son was very entertained (20 months old), but one thing bothered me about it. There is a scene when they talk about eating fruits and vegetables, and then they decide that those are bad and that ice cream is better. Not to be a stickler (my son loves ice cream as much as the rest of them), but it makes fighting the battle of vegetables even harder when Barney doesn't back you! There are other videos (like the zoo one) where they make fruits and veggies fun, but this one dropped the ball."
3,"An insteresting, though partisan, read","This book provides a fascinating read about an area the author correctly labels ignored: What presidents did after retirement. Written in a fashion made for the general public, with brief summeries of each president, anecdotes, and unique things about each post-presidentail career, this manages to be informative without being a scholarly work. However, he frequently punctures his analysis with political opinion that will annoy across the political spectrum; but if you find this book for cheap, it is worth a read."
4,A good wholesome story,"If you enjoy a good wholesome story that you do not have to skip words or offensive scenes, then this is a good series for you. It takes you to a small town and introduces you to a range of folks who have real life experiences. God is a central part of thier lifes and they count on that.I highly recommend this book and the entire series. Katherine Valentineis a great writer. I am glad I found her.sashley"
1,propaganda,"Very left anti-capitalism book. Contains no cogent arguments. Facts are skewed or are outright lies. Example: Page 56 states ""The huge budget deficits during the Reagan years in the 1980s were due to tax cuts..."" When , in fact, data from 'Budget of the United States Government: Historical Tables' show large increases in Government revenue during the years after the tax cuts. The increased deficits being due to large house/senate spending. Of course, in this book, Bill Clinton can do no wrong. Over all, this book is a very hard left leaning and biased work. I wish I could get my money back."
5,Excellent book,"As descibed on it's cover this book was exactly as I wanted, brand new and cheaper than ebay. Full description of engine and exploded diagrams. Highly recommended."
4,red band 135 hp manual,Exactly what i was after. Finding the book a good help with the old engine. thanks
2,Good but straps dig into neck,Our daughter is 7 and the straps dig into her neck a little. However it has very good coverage and light. The heart guard shirts even the extra small were too big and the shield would be at her stomach level. We are taking it a tailor to have the shoulder straps folded in half to make them thinner or put some fleece around them so its more comfortable. Other than the modification I think its great.**updateDidnt work out. To restrictive. Had the straps replaced to look more like over all to get it off the neck but it was to bulky. Went with the evoshield. Way better.
2,not groovin,"I just could not get into the groove with this video. I can't move like that so I didn't feel like I was getting much of a workout from it. I enjoyed the sculpting parts best. The backdrop is pretty boring too. And the way the instructor kept saying, ""I'm right here with you"" made me wonder if she thought I was insecure to do this on my own. It gets annoying after awhile."
1,Warning!!!! This is a Refurbished unit,"1, refurbished not mantioned in add.2. somthing rattleing inside3. scratches all over4. BAD picture quality5. mount is worthless"
3,not for my needs,"This product did not work well for my needs. The fabric is very durable but too stiff when new to pull it closed tightly enough to keep contents in. It will probably work in but I did not want to wait that amount of time. We have the original ""buckett boss"" and love it."
1,did not receive what I ordered.,"I ordered the the bucket boss parachute bag but received some kind of roll up pouch for wrenches, etc. I'm going to try to put it to use but disappointed I didn't get the parachute bag."
5,Fantastic!,"Nice heavy material, perfect for the drywall screws that I purchased it for. When doing a project I simply grab the whole bag and I have any screw size I might need."
4,Good gift for do-it-yourselfers,"I bought this for my dad for christmas. Can be used for anything from tools, to screws, to car products. Heavy duty quality fabric."
3,Not what I expected,"This item was not quite what I expected, but it will be handy. I expected that it would utilize a bucket. The description is not clear enough. With the name Bucket Boss, the description should state clearly whether or not the product makes use of a bucket."
3,Nice bag,"Bag is very well made, The only thing about this bag is there is no way to keep the screws or whatever you keep in this bag seperated. The pockets are not complete, there is a gap between the sections where small screws and get mixed up."
2,Original Bucket Boss Parachute Bag a Better Buy,"I use this bag with assorted lengths of decking screws, so it carries roughly 10lbs of screws at a time. Even with this amount of weight the closure system doesn't work right. Meanwhile, the cheaper ""chutes"" bag works flawlessly. Save your pennies and buy the older style."
5,"great for fasterners, wirenuts and the like","I have gotten great service from the parachute bag I bought years ago, and today's price is even lower. This is one of those products that works the way it is supposed to work, delivers what is promised, and leaves you smiling. Highly recommended."
5,great,Sturdy. Many pockets. A tad small but toletable considering it's primary function as a mobile depository for screws and nails. I plan on buying more bags in different sizes.
4,Forgotten Classic,"If you're looking for a reminder of how great the Atlanta Rhythm Section was, start with this CD. The first album Dog Days wasn't quite as good as I remember, but I needed some of those songs for the car, like Boogie Smoogie & Dog Days. The songs Bless My Soul & Silent Treatment are an excellent prelude to the album Red Tape, which is why I bought this CD. There's not a bad song on this album, & half of them I remember from the radio when it was out. Heck, not just when it was out--I heard Another Man's Woman playing on a bookstore's sound system outside & realized I had to have that album now. Listen to Oh What a Feeling or Mixed Emotions & try to get that song out of your head. A Top 20 album of all time, at least one of the Top 20 Underrated albums of all time."
1,No way to partition and really bad customer service,"This hard drive seems like like a good choice until you open the box and try to create a partition (a simple task for anyone). I am fairly savy with things like this, but a partition simply could not be created. I tried to look at the FAQ and tried to get help from their tech deparment. The only thing the tech people do a Lacie is refer you back to the FAQ....I guess it's cheaper than having real tech-folks on the payroll. So...if you don't need to partition your hard drive or if you think and if you think the only problems you will EVER have will some how be able to be resolved by their FAQ section.....then...I recomend this hard drive"
4,Almost perfect... louder than other sizes,"I've got a 250 Gb Lacie Brick currently and decided to add to the lego family. Got the 500 Gb and things are grand. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 is the noise. The 250 Gb model is quiet as a mouse, but the bigger brother sounds like a small engine. Not happy with the noise, but I am mainly using it for backup, so I'll turn it off when it's not in use. Lacie should take these kinds of things inconsideration when putting out new products. People buy from them because of the quality and their design, not because they're cheaper than the rest."
4,"Lacie has the ""cool"" factor","I recently bought Lacie 500 GB Desktop (USB) Hard Drive, after using it in my lab. The hard drive has an effective free space of 465 GB. Thats quite a lot going into formatting. Works well on PCs, on Mac G4 it is a bit slower, don't know why. More than anything else, it has the ""cool"" factor because of its design. I am sure there are more efficient and sturdier HDs out there but this one just looks really cool. Overall it works well. The Lacie backup software that comes with it is quite ordinary though. It is slow, and only does a blind copy of the files. No options to make disk images etc."
3,"Speed not Too fast, LED does not indicate disk activity","Worked right out of the box. Runs a bit slower than my other USB hard disks, but still ok. About 250 MegBytes/sec transfer rate. Windows XP. Comes formatted as FAT32. LaCie website recommends reformatting to NTFS, which helped the speed for smaller files.Don't like the Red LED. Just indicated unit is running. Does not flash when there is disk activity. Actually, if I look at just the right angle, I can see a wee bit of flashing, but have to have my face close to see it.Appearance is great. Love the look. Noise is so-so. Quieter than one other HD, but noisier than 2 others.Wanted to buy another of this style, but will look at other models now.."
3,"A cute, but rather slow, romantic comedy","I love romantic comedies, and who doesn't love Meg and Tom together?? However, I don't think they will ever surpass the emotions felt in ""Sleepless."" Meg should have had a more realistic apartment for a middle-income single person, and most importantly, I would never accept Tom's character without an APOLOGY for doing what he did to her business!! Even that selfish, self-centered Scarlett O'Hara, showed remorse for her actions!! No matter how many movies they may make together, or singulary, I'll be at the theatre on opening night!"
3,second of SO-SO,"I do not like the situation is not equal. first of all, they were in even, but middle of story, the guy who knows the email partner, but he did not show up in front of her! how come?? It makes me an objection...so, I also give 3 point to this movie. sorry."
4,LOVENET,"Isn't it amazing that this story does happen to anyone of us? This is a truely brilliant movie and I think Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are the most compatible onscreen lovers. For those who are internet enthusiast, do make it a point to watch this movie. :OD"
5,I THOGHT THE MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD,I SEEN THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD ROMANCE AND COMEDY IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET I RECOMEND YOU TO GO SEE IT
1,You've Got a Piece of Cr@p!,"You've got a weak story, weak characters, and a very weak ending (I mean come on - she actually falls for this guy?). For those who have never seen this movie and are considering purchasing the video - please think twice. Read some of the other reviews down below to get an overall picture. If you are into sappiness without a consistent story, it may be for you."
3,Excellent Movie ... Deceptive Product Description,"We bought this more expensive version because we saw that the soundtrack came with it on the DVD. Nope. It comes with the movie, the movie with commentary, and the movie with soundtrack (no words)."
5,Great seller,Had to return the first one. Seller was very quick to respond and send out another. Thank you.
3,Good Remake of a Classic,"You Got Mail is a wonderful movie, but it is hardly an original story. The screenplay is losely based on 1949 classic ""In the Good Old Summertime"" starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson. Both Garland and Johnson work together in a music store and unknowingly begin to have romantic correspondances. They bicker endlessly, but begin to fall in live even before they realize they had been writting to each other the whole time. There are several scenes directly used in the picture, including the wonderful coffee house scene where Hanks badgers Ryan about her mysterious date. What makes You got Mail work is the sappy romance this duo created in Sleepless..."" and carry over to this movie. Very enjoyable, but certainly check out the original if you have the time. (note: I would have loved Meg Ryan trying some of Garlands dance numbers)"
4,"You've Got Mail is REALLY cute, but...","Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan play their parts perfectly in this humorous, cute movie. The only thing I don't like about it is that they just HAD to have ""Kathleen"" (Meg) and that silly employee-girl talk about cyber-sex and they just HAD to show Patricia and Joe sharing a bed. THAT was unnecessary, thank you. (So... if you've got kids who you want to keep innocent to the crazy, disgusting ways of family-building we have here in America for just a while longer, avoid this movie.) But, be reassured, those two scenes are definitely NOT the point of the movie, and, when you look beyond them, ""You've Got Mail"" is adorable, funny, intelligent, realistic, and altogether a great couple hours of entertainment. I really enjoyed it."
1,No Instant Video As Promoted,I bought the DVD with the promise of an instant video so I could watch the movie rental free;. Over 2 hours later I am still waiting for the instant free rental!! They were very quick to e-mail the invoice (10 sec)! Not so quick on the promotional offer. I had planned a movie night now it looks like I will have to wait until the DVD gets here. Thanks Amazon!
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A tepid updating of The Shop Around the Corner, You've Got Mail mainly functions as an extended commerical for AOL and Starbucks; if you didn't get enough of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks in Sleepless in Seattle then I guess you should watch this, otherwise stay away."
3,Received Too Late,I love the movie. Packaged great. I received the item 3 days after I was supposed to. I paid for overnight shipping and received the item days afterwards.
3,"If you look at the facts, it's not so cute.","My wife really likes this movie for all the reasons the producers intended it to appeal to her. I thought it was cute, but from a more objective perspective sad.Person A has a live-in girlfriend. Person B has a live-in boyfriend. Persons A & B do not love the person they are sleeping with, so initiate an emotional relationship with each other via email, lying to their respective lovers to keep it hidden from them. Person A discovers the identity of Person B and realizes it is someone he hates in real life, nonetheless, he lies to her and continues the email relationship. Eventually, by telling many more lies, he orchestrates circumstances to make Person B like him and then revels his identity as her email pen pal. Best quote: Person B ""I was hoping it was you"" (cries). Yep, that's the foundation for a really strong relationship. I guess after the movie gets over they're going to move in together. Hope they decide to disconnect AOL..."
4,Delivered as promissed,"It was delivered as promised. Everything worked fine, no complaints. It is not wholly 100% high definition but it is a very good upgrade of the original movie."
5,You've Got Mail has good taste!,"I found this movie to be a refreshing romantic comedy as only Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks can produce. Their onscreen performances are wonderful, light, witty and down right hysterical! You won't be bored with this movie, whether you're a guy, or a gal! This is a great second date rental, and won't make either party uncomfortable. This is a must see, and will fast become a Saturday night favorite in your home! For people with small children, there are a few scenes with some foul language, so be careful who's watching!"
5,"One of the most pleasant, relaxing romatic movies ever made.","Remembering this film makes me want to cuddle on a nice, soft, couch, no matter how weird it sounds. This film is so unbearably cute, so much, that I can't help but smile and actually laugh while watching the movie, even when nothing funny is happeining. I just love the potrait of Christmas time in small-city-suburbian New York. The setting is just too good; snow, christmas lights, cozy book stores, light/heavy traffic, walks in the little parks, trees, moody music, and, well, everything else. This goes hand in hand with the acting. The acting is impeccable -- Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks actually look like they really belong together, and thus, the joyus spirt runs abundant throughout the entire film. There's really no way you can hate it; you have to love it. It's too cute(even for a guy like me) to look over. Watch it, like it."
3,Charming Remake That Fits the 90's,"1940's version ""Shop Around The Corner"" & 1949 version""In the Good Old Summertime"" has been updated to the 90's & nothing has changed in the story with the exception ofits taking place in the 90's & a few minor differences in order to make it a story of the 90's. Very charming version. But, I doubt that it would have been as charming if not for Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan. For a good change, here's a remake of a remake that doesn't bring any surprises, but is really pleasant...."
4,"Good Film -- even the guys should like this ""chick flick!""",Entertaining and fun relationship flick with the outstanding team of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. These two always work great together!
4,Love books and you will find love...,"As a librarian I just love movies and books around books or libraries. This movie is about the lovestory of the children's bookshop owner Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) and the owner of the big chain of bookstores Joe Fox (Tom Hanks). They both are in relationships without love. Because Joe opens a big bookshop close to the little shop of Kathleen she goes out of business. For him it was just business. Not for her because her late mother opened the store years ago. Anonymously they are already emailfriends. Joe finds out about this when they planned to meet and starts using this contact to get closer to her. Because it is a lovestory you know how it will end. This is also very clear from the beginning of the movie but you don't mind. If you love a good romantic movie, keep your tissues ready. I needed a few at the end."
5,On favorites list,"I love this movie! I watch it a couple nights a week when the hubby is out hunting or I'm too restless to fall asleep. It's a cheery, feel-good movie that puts me in a peaceful happy mood."
4,will see many more times,"I've seen You've Got Mail 10-12 times through the years and will see again. Those who don't ""get it"" well, just don't get it~~it's a romantic fantasy escape from the realities we face in the day to day routines of life. Either you value romance or you don't, but for the romantic soul, no one would walk from this unhappy about Meg or Tom's performances, or the plot, or the ""predictable"" ending someone wrote above.You never know lonely ones, you could be the next couple that meets and falls in love via You've Got Mail."
4,A delightful movie,"This movie is a drink of sparkling champagne! It's the West Side like we all wished it would be. It did lose one star, though, for I felt that Meg Ryan's reaction to impending competition was that of a spoiled child instead of an adult business woman. To street protest your competion as she did is rather low class."
3,Some one you don't even know may already be screwing you.,"Some one you don't even know may already be screwing you: here Tom Hanks plays the chainstore magnate forcing quirky indie bookseller Meg Ryan out of business, at the same time as he is wooing her on AOL -- first anonymously, then with full but one-sided knowledge of her identity. By the time she discovers the truth, she's all dimples & twinkly blue eyes, and is grateful for a hug instead of a job. Ostensibly drawing on the shut-down of Madison Avenue Bookshop by landlord Whitney Museum, and continuing animosity between indies and chain bookstores, ""You've Got Mail"" is nevertheless an orgy of product placement -- for AOL, certainly, but also notably for Starbucks. A New York Observer columnist claims an ego-enwrapt minor character was based on him."
3,Gotta love the Brits...,"Thank you, Nigel David Chesterson III from London, had you not pointed out your ""considerable intelligence"", I am quite confident we would never have noticed it. This movie was average, nothing more, nothing less."
3,"good, but a little drawn out","This is defenitely a cute movie and if you like romantic comedy go for it, but the story line was drawn out quite a bit and got a little boring after awhile. My advice stick to Sleepless and don't be dissapointed by Hanks and Ryan's performance!"
5,A lovely movie,"I like this movie a lot. Somehow, it let me recall of ""Sleepless in Seattle"" all the time. I was touched at the end of the movie when Meg said I dreadly hope it was you... I was speechless at this momenent. Just love it!"
4,Love and Forgiveness,"I enjoyed this movie. It touches on love and forgiveness. Sometimes the very person you fall inlove with isn't always the ideal person, but who knows love better than the heart. This shows that with Meg and Tom battling it out over the book store, Joe Foxx wins, shuts the Shopgirl down, but fate was waiting around the corner. Through the aol e-mail You've Got Mail the two come into contact,fall inlove and because Joe Foxx knows that Shopgirl doesn't like him because he shut her business down he uses his wit and charm to win her heart. It is a good movie, one of my favorites"
5,Fun and Funny!,"This movie is about two bookshop owners, Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), whose store, The Shop Around the Corner, is a small family business and Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) whose family owns the chain of big, modern Fox Books bookstores. Kathleen's store is losing business to Fox Books, and is in danger of closing down. Kathleen is feeling very hostile toward the owner, Joe Fox, but what she doesn't know is that Joe is the nice, funny guy she's been emailing back and forth with since the two met in a chatroom. Joe, after meeting Kathleen (but not knowing he's been emailing her) describes Kathleen as ""a pill"" to a friend and co-worker. Joe has no idea that Kathleen is the sweet, charming woman he's been emailing.The plot of this movie was clever and funny, and this was an enjoyable movie to watch. You've Got Mail is a sweet, light movie that's full of heart and is funny without trying too hard."
4,Awesome movie,A movie ahead of the times this is a must see pic and you will watch it again and again and again so what r u waiting for?
5,Shipped quick!,"Love this movie. It shipped quickly, got here fast, and I got it brand new at a great price for BluRay. The only complaint I have is that I haven't had time to sit down and watch it yet! Haha!"
5,A great romance-comedy,"I really liked this movie. It isn't too cheesy and unrealistic, well maybe a bit, but I still love the story. Tom and Meg are great actors and they are perfect for romance-comedies, I swear I could watch this movie anytime."
4,Deluxe edition,"I got everything in good order however the package did not look like an original version, hte cover was not the movie's cover. The important thing is that the movie quality was excellent but no spanish subtitles... :("
5,I miss Nora,This is such a wonderful film. It makes me miss Nora so much just thinking of what else she would have written.
4,Like an old-time movie,"This movie can be enjoyed by the whole family, something you can't say about most of the garbage coming out in Hollywood..if you are a Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan fan, you'll like this movie... my wife says Meg is in desperate need of a ""new doo""....this movie begs for a sequel, however, as the ending leaves you with as many questions as answers.."
3,This movie was very good.,"This movie was very good but I think Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan should have gotten together earlier in the movie instead of at the end. It was a good romantic comedy, very clean, no cursing and no sex."
5,Great movie,this was indeed a great movie and I enjoyed it very much but I also got it at Walmart for only 14.95 so Isaved even more.Also no shipping and handling cost.
3,Stlted and dragging story with uninspired performances.,This remake of two previous versions of the basic story is remarkable for the uninspired performances by both Hanks and Ryan. The story drags continously making it a sure cure for insomnia.
4,You've Got Mail,"This is a great movie. While it came out in 1998 it is amazing how dated the Internet and computer technology is in the movie, which adds to the charm of the movie. I first saw the movie in the theater with my late wife and tonight I watched it with my new wife. While many will call it a 'chick flick' it is a great David vs Goliath movie. The little book store vs the giant megabook store sub-text is fun to watch. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have great chemistry together. This movie is much like the old screwball comedies from the 1940's, with two characters almost meeting or meeting and not realizing they already have a relationship, but don't realize who they really are. I recommend it. I also review movies and books relating to military history and told soldiers on my blog,[...]"
4,You've Got Mail,"I am a sucker for Tom Hanks and any role he plays. I know that this was a take off of the ""Little Shop Around the Corner"" (which I liked). Supporting cast was good and Meg Ryan was terrific. A great movie for me when I need a mental pick-p."
4,You've Got Mail (Deluxe Edition),"Kathleen Kelly, owner of a little and famous bookstore for children's books, has an affair. Being together with Frank Navasky, a well-known journalist, she betrays him by e-mailing secretly and anonymously with a also betraying man whom she met in a chat room. Suddenly, her business gets endangered by the opening of Fox Books discount store just ""around the corner"". She meets Joe Fox, son of the owner, and soon gets annoyed by his arrogant way of managing business matters. Although getting advice by her anonymous mail-pal, she has to close down her store. But Joe Fox's life suddenly gets out of control when he learns that his anonymous mail-pal is nobody other than Kathleen Kelly. Great movie, great performances, great music. To everyone who hasn't yet seen this movie rent it, buy it, enjoy it."
5,119 minute AOL commercial with a great plot.,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have to be one of the best recent movie couples. They work as well together in You've Got Mail as they did in Sleepless in Seattle.The fact that this was just a long commercial for AOL didn't spoil the movie. I suppose if you are an AOL user that you might enjoy it even more.This is a movie that spans the generation gap, my wife and I enjoyed it, and my parents enjoyed it as well. After seeing other net movies, this one lacked the network involvement that you would expect, but it was a good romance movie.The director Nora Ephron put this movie together very quickly, based on the Ernst Lubitsch classic, The Shop Around the Corner, with a 90's twist to it. Although the movie was created in a very short amount of time, it doesn't show through. I wouldn't have even konw this if I hadn't seen an interview with the director."
4,So romantic!,I've never seen a movie like 'You've got mail' It's so sweet and romatic. it's worth seeing.
3,SLEEPLESS IN SEATLLE MEETS AOL...,"Besides that fact that this a two-hour non-stop commercial for America Online, Meg & Tom give one of the freshest perfomances in recent romantic comedies. They bring back some of that good time we all had watching SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE. Meg and Tom are both perfect for this. I've enjoyed YOU'VE GOT MAIL, because it's story-line isn't too unrealistic for the 90's, it has a witty script and a fantastic choice of music. But really - what else would you expect from a team (Noah Ephron of Harry & Sally fame!) like this?!"
3,Rent This and Buy the Original Instead -- Really,"Are amazon.com viewers this undiscriminating to give this film such high marks? It's a pleasant enough film, primarily because of the ongoing chemistry between Hanks and Ryan, but it's so so predictable (and all of the other characters are absolute ciphers). While there are a lot of good DVD features on the disc, I'm relieved I rented this and did not purchase. If you haven't seen the original and totally wonderful ""Shop Around the Corner,"" do yourself a favor and get it instead. In it, Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan create complicated, funny, cruel, wonderful characters. And as for the box for the DVD, would studios please stop airbrushing the actors to death? Tom Hanks looks like a plastic mannequin."
2,Bland,"I hate to be the bad guy, but someone has got to be brutally honest. I almost fell asleep watching this. Sleepless in Seattle was 10 times better and just because Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are reunited doesn't make the movie any better. It takes her way too long to figure out it is the seemingly chauvanistic Fox Books owner with whom she exchanges romantic e-mails. Please, I know movies aren't realistic in general but really - this was boring and I expected more. Better luck next time."
2,An utter flop!,"Despite exellent casting and a cute story line this movie failed miserablly. The story simpily lags, and in the end you just don't care what happens! What ever happened to the cemistry between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan!"
2,Boring peace of junk,"Hey the story is very weak that Dramatic peace is so unenjoyable despite that the film casting is great,,, I have it on DVD I hope it could be just better & the DVD having pc friendly is OK but the cursors & icons is not nice to use & no wallpapers or sounds makes me disappointed"
2,Blah,"Get this movie out of my queue. I don't remember what this movie was about anymore except one thing after watching it: i asked myself, ""why people think this movie is so good?"""
1,could have been better,"I thought this movie wasn't that great. It seemed like everything was kinda staged. Plus, the title sounds like something out of AOL. Would you really stoop that low to find someone?"
4,Recommended!,"This is a smart, witty, romantic comedy. I like anything that has to do with the internet so I bought this DVD without even seeing it first and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. Okay, yes, it is kind of a chick flick but it has everything I like. The internet, books, romance, comedy, drama, and the list goes on. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good movie."
4,Nora Doing What She Does Best,"This is a really sleek film, both in terms of presentation and storyline. The plot, reminiscent of Sleepless in Seattle, revolves around Meg and Tom, two books store owner. The former presides over a cozy, small book store, the latter possesses a huge book franchise. The two meet and, of course, the small bookstore closes down, Meg is furious, Tom is in love, and then the rest deals with how the two eventually patch up their differences. Not a classic, but still very enjoyable. As a New Yorker, I loved how well the city was incorporated into the film. Yes, we know things are not as beautiful in real life, but come on, this is Hollywood we are talking about. Anyways, You've Got Mail is a film that you will love for its charm value and panache."
4,A Nice Surprise,"I was prepared to dislike this movie and was pleasantly surprised when I watched it. Tom Hanks is a tough, no-nonsense businessmean whose empire forces Meg Ryan's small, family-run bookstore out of business. Then an unlikely chemistry develops, and to stay current with the time, the script includes the Internet and its most widely used feature, email. Tom Hanks continues to spin comedy around his refined sarcasm and witticisms over Socratic reasoning. Meg Ryan walk a tight rope between overacting and good performance. In the end, I think, the movie succeeds becuase it has a good script, good acting, and a fast developemt of events. This is much better than I expected. The soundtrack is as good as ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and the movie itself is better. I would not miss this one."
3,Romantic comedy could go on forever,"The last part is at times frustrating to watch. Each scene Meg Ryan berates Tom Hanks' character, Joe Fox, for being such a heel to want to buy out her book store. The conversation breaks off and you want to shout at him, ""Tell her, stupid! It was you who sent the love emails full of kind advice!"" Each scene is constructed so Meg Ryan could never discover Joe Fox really sent the romantic emails. That said, I also wish Tom could let his hair grow out a little for his romantic films and lighten up his tenseness with the butch cut he keeps from his military dramas like Saving Private Ryan. He gets to kiss Ryan this time..no pun intended."
5,"Sweet, Cute and Romantic","Starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, this comedy/love story is as capturing for the young at heart as for all the romantics. Inspiring tale of Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) and Joe Fox (Hanks) who both have a lot in common, including the book stores they each own and run in competition with. Not since Tom and Meg meat on ""Sleepless in Seattle"" this story will bring tears to your eyes and a feel for romance in New York.Not to spoil the story line, but with a little hint, after seeing this movie it sure will make you feel wonderful about receiving e-mail, and hearing the little sound of... ""You've got mail""..."
3,Renewal,"This film ""You've got mail"", is a high tech adaptation of the Doris Day/ Rock Hudson film ""Pillow Talk"". Glossed up with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, this version have lost some of the magic bought to us by the Day/ Hudson combination, but the Ryan/ Hanks combination served its full purpose. However, this film is way too cliche and predictable compared to ""Pillow Talk"". It follows the mishaps of two Internet ""friends"" who eventually meet and hate each other. This ""Internet"" thing is actually an advertising ploy for AOL. Anyway, it made some people laugh and that's what matters most in these ""feel good"" films."
5,one of the cutest stories I've ever watched!!!,"I love this movie!! I especially love how well all the characters interact - they are real people. This is a favorite between my sister, my mother and myself - we cannot get together without quoting lines. I particularly enjoy the DVD format and the wonderful extras included on the disc, like the screen savers, the e-cards and the access to the screenplay on the website. Hopefully more DVD movies will start including these great features!!"
4,An enjoyable romantic comedy,"This is a delightful romantic comedy. The story concerns the owner of a small children's bookshop, Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), whose livelihood is threatened when a huge superstore bookshop, owned by Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), is about to open just around the corner from Kelly's store. Kelly and Fox, both single, start up an on-line romance but without knowing who the other is. The movie has resonances with its predecessor, Sleepless in Seattle, starring Ryan and Hanks, but it is not as emotionally involving:but it's an enjoyable film."
5,great movie,This movie is the best! Winter in New York. Twinkle Lights. Although Meg Ryan really overacts when she's pretending to have a cold. I love Nora Ephron.
4,Truly fun and moving film!,"There is really nothing bad to say about this film! The very clever music score accentuates the light-hearted overall feeling of the film and the tunes sung by the late great Harry Nilsson are perfect accompaniment. The late Nora Ephron knew what she was doing here - kind of a female Woody Allen! And it's always great to lay eyes on the elusive Jean Stapleton (""Edith Bunker"".)The DVD is a simple affair with a few extras, but I'll let others discuss those. I say buy it and don't look back!"
4,One of my favorite romantic comedies,Meg Ryan is at her best in this film. It just leaves you feeling good. Nora Ephron was so talented and she will be missed.
2,can't stand up to the original,"I love Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, and I love romantic comedies. That being said, I can't understand why the producers would have taken a charming comedy ""The Shop Around the Corner"" and redone the film, taking all the warmth, wit, and charm right out of it. The orginal, with Jimmy Stewart, is probably one of the ten best films of all time. I saw nothing remotely charming or interesting about the supposed remake, which almost can't even be called a remake with the heavy handed rewriting that went on. I have nothing against rewriting or redoing classic films, but if you're going to redo it, at least IMPROVE on the original, or there's not reason to try to redo it in the first place. Save your time and money. Forget about this one, and get ""The Shop Around the Corner""."
3,"A fun movie, but flawed","I enjoy watching this film and have seen it a few times but it's not a great film nor does it compare with Sleepless in Seattle. I just didn't think that there was much chemistry between the Ryan and Hank characters. I also found it hard to believe that Hanks (a cocky businessman who laughs when he's told that his company just put a small bookstore out of business) will live ""happily ever after"" with the Ryan character who is anti big business and lost her family bookstore because of Hanks. Still it's a fun film and I enjoy it each time I watch it.One other note: Anyone else find it strange that the Ryan character, who spends much of the movie complaining about the big chains that come in and put the little neigherhood shops out of business, is shown buying her coffee at Starbucks. A little inconsistent I think."
2,Cute but boring,"I saw this on an airplane and afterwards was SO glad I didn't pay to see it. Yes, Hanks & Ryan are cute (as is everyone else in the film); yes it's well done and NYC looks romantic and charming, and it's mildly amusing, but c'mon! There's not an ounce of suspense (will they or won't they?) or laugh-out-loud humor in this. And hardly any creativity -- everything from the actors, to the dialogue, to the scenery, has been done before. Even the email/technology angle isn't realistic. If you're feeling blue and looking for something fluffy, rent it or watch it on cable, but don't buy it!"
5,MEG RYAN AND TOM HANKS DO IT AGAIN!,"You've got mail is another perfect movie for those two wonderful stars. Meg and Tom belong on screen together, Sleepless was great but You've got mail was even better. It is a must see. Meg and Tom are rival bookstore owners, who just happen to be secret email loves. Romantic and funny, this movie is a must!"
3,Pleasant diversion.,"It's generally acknowledged that Tom and Meg are both likeable. There are some good, funny moments. There's some good music. There's the obligatory happy ending. All in all, if you take this for what it is -- a pleasant diversion -- it's not a bad movie.I do want to pick at a couple of things, though:1. One of the messages seems to be that if a greedy corporation eliminates your job, it's okay because the handsome, rich young exec of the corporation will ask you to marry him.2. What an outrageously misleading advertisement for AOL this movie was. Did you see how FAST Meg got dialed in and connected? No busy signals, no being downgraded to a secondary, 28K connection. What a crock."
5,Interesting and Enjoyable Movie,"I bought this DVD for my wife because she already has the VHS version (without the extras), and I knew she would enjoy the DVD more. She has thoroughly enjoyed it. The extras were a big hit. She especially likes to quickly go to whatever scene she wants to watch.Guys, if you want to score some points with your wives, buy this DVD for them. You may have to sit and watch it with them at least once, but you shouldn't find it an unpleasant experience. It's a very enjoyable movie. As for me, I'd watch it again."
5,VERY WITTY!,"THIS REMAKE OF THE OLD JIMMY STEWART FILM HAS REALLY HIT THE MARK. TOM HANKS WINS YOUR HEART IN THIS ONE, AND MEG RYAN, ADORABLE!"
5,can't get enough,I seriously can't get enough of this romantic movie. I love it. I even used a song from it for my wedding.
3,"Tom and Meg, Together Again","It's hard to explain why I like this movie as much as I do. I suppose I'm a sucker for light hearted romantic comedies. Indeed, if I'm in the mood for something funny, comforting and familiar, You've Got Mail is almost always in the top 10. This is not to say that it's one of the 10 greatest films, it's not.Now, in 2004, the dial up AOL accounts are being phased out. I'm not sure what the status of the chat rooms are anymore. So, yes, the premise is now a bit dated. Still, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan work great together.If this is what you're in the mood for, You've Got Mail is still a good way to spend a couple of hours, get a couple of laughs in, and not be challenged too much,"
5,Best movie of 1998,"This movie is the best of the year-the perfect mixture of humor, e-mail, and the feeling of one business conquering another!I cannot see why people reject this masterpiece."
5,YaY!!!,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! I have seen it an amazing 12 times!! I have almost memorized it and I still love it. I think that it combines comedy and romance very well and the fact that there are two very talented actors in it makes it even better. I LOVE ""THE PUPPY SONG"" BY HARRY NILSSON!!!"
3,Good premise and acting but...,"Too unbelievable, too long, not as good as Sleepless in Seattle, needed something more to make this movie memorable.I did enjoy looking at the extra features like the sites of the city that referenced the movie."
3,Way too long,Cute and all that stuff but still...way too long and too unlikely that those 2 are so closely involved and dont know who they are.
3,"Nice, but haven't we seen this before?","A good addition to any video library. A familiar movie, but nobody seems to care that this has all been done before. Luckily, we had Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, otherwise it probably would have been left to die on the scrap heap. Having said that, if you don't like either Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan, there's really no point in your seeing it. But if you like them, as we did, then it doesn't really matter that there really wasn't much to this movie that a box of Kleenex wouldn't cure."
1,A three hour ad for AOL and Starbucks,"I've seen this movie twice: once on a plane without the headphones, and once at home on our VCR. You've Got Mail is passable as a silent film. If you look up from your New Yorker magazine from time to time, it can be quite pleasant visually.As a regular film with sound, though, it is a stinker, and should be carefully scooped up, placed in a plastic bag, and discarded. It was unpalatably cynical, even to this cynical reviewer. It was dated, it shamelessly promoted brand names (probably for remuneration), and the plot was... hey, wait, I'm wasting my time."
1,Cannot play movie in my DVD player,"This movie came to me in a package in nice shape but it is set for the wrong region and won't even play on my DVD player. I've been too busy to return it, hoping I can fix or set my DVD player somehow."
1,Return to Sender,"In my opinion, one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. (I wanted to rate this movie zero stars, but Amazon only allows ratings from one to five.) While I admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Nora Ephron's directing/writing work (Sleeples in Seattle, Michael, Mixed Nuts & Hanging Up), I was willing to give this movie the benefit of the doubt because I do like Tom Hanks. Needless to say, even Hanks couldn't carry this god-awful mess. The dialogue is so sappy and forced you tend to wonder how Hanks could pull off his lines with a straight face. Meg Ryan dials in her usual ""look how cute I am!"" performance.Here's the plot: Hanks is involved in a buyout of the bookstore where Ryan works. Unknowingly, Hanks and Ryan engage in a cyber relationship and slowly fall in love. A good premise, but in the hands of the overrated Ephron it falls flat.This movie is marketed as a ""date"" movie. Do your date a favor and watch ""Caligula"". Even that sorry film had more romance than this fluff."
1,pap,"This film is utter pap.It seems that Hollywood is willing to slap these two together and regurge Sleepless in Seattle for a few million.And it seems that America as a whole has come like sheep to follow Hollywood.Tom Hanks has way too much talent to waste on a wooden flick such as this. Meg Ryan needs to get more sleep and get rid of the undereye circles before she can claim her cutsie status again.Not to mention, when is she going to grow up and start doing adult movies with real characters instead of fluff pieces.I felt like the time I spent watching this movie could have been better spent clipping toenails for gods sake."
1,And then I woke up!,"What a boring movie this is! Very disappointing, bland, unfunny, unromantic and totally dull. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks looked like they were just going through the same old motions. There is nothing witty or spontaneous to look forward to - forget it! Watching a wheel going round is more entertaining."
1,Wretched - This is no Sleepless In Seattle,"Meg Ryan's cutesy bit is out of control in this steaming pile of heavy handed romantic comedy. Fortunately the anti corporate message seems to fade into the woodwork as Meg and Tom down Starbucks lattes and trade dull barbs backed by no chemistry. Shop Around the Corner pulled it off in 1940, but a 90s setting really makes deceptive courting seem dated. I loved Sleepless, but Meg Ryan was subdued and Tom Hanks played a character with whom you could sympathize. The only sympathy here comes from fellow suffering audience members who also had to sit through the many needless psuedo-climaxes. Ugh."
1,"A really bad ""Sleepless in Seattle"" ripoff","Boring, predictable and a complete lack of any substance and drama. I am a big Tom Hanks fan but this movie was hideous. Don't waste your time watching this film. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks had zero chemistry and their characters could not be any less intriguing. I would truely rate this as one of the ten worst movies I have ever seen."
1,Shameless in NY,"One star is too many for this moronic debasement of the great Ernst Lubitsch's exquisite comedy The Shop Around the Corner. Tom Hanks runs a huge corporation but has endless time to mooch around Meg Ryan, who is constantly showing us how adorable she is (""Don't you think daisies are the friendliest flowers?""). You've never seen such unconvincing acting as the actors pretending to find the limp, banal lines amusing; even the dog has to help out with a funny face. Considering the sheepish, exhausted air of the whole thing, it's doubtful Ephron believes in her own (script as well as direction) movie. Please buy the Lubitsch and see what a difference passion and intelligence make."
2,Not up to snuff,"I think people are so anxious to put Tom Hanks and Meg ryan in ANYTHING together, that it doesn't matter to them if the movie is actually good. If you want to see a good Hanks/Ryan movie, rent Sleepless in Seattle."
2,A true meaning of a sleeper.,"I love Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, but this movie was vey slow and I kept waiting for the climax. I was also disappionted in the ending. What happens next? I waited that long I could have waited for two more minutes for a bit more of an ending. Sorry but I expected more out of the two fine actors and this skript."
2,More Sappy Ryan,"Hanks is great (although not in this), even he does not save this pathetic movie. I truly believe that Ryan is talented (and cute) but why does she continue to accept these sappy roles. Wake Up Meg!"
2,Enough with Meg and Tom Pairings!!!,"I was excited about seeing this movie, because I loved Sleepness in Seattle, but what a disappointment this movie was. The characters were unreal and glossed up (enough already with the close-ups of Meg and Tom!!). Also the plot was uninteresting and unbelievable. The only thing that I really liked about the movie was Meg Regan's apartment, kudos to the set director. Also, the movie wasted the talents of a wonderful actress, Parker Posey, by making her whiny and annoying."
2,"Ok, but too fluffy & unrealistic","'You've Got Mail' was a cute little movie, esp. considering that Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were a couple in it, but it's definitely not a must-see. For one thing, it was very predictable. After the first five minutes I knew what was going to happen for the rest of the movie. For another, Joe Fox was just the *perfect* lover. He was extremly romantic, he treated Kathleen like a queen, he never thought of himself, he even set up the little rondevous where he reveals himself as the unseen man of her dreams. How many people do you meet like that? With some neat parts, a long running time and a corny ending, YGM will not go down as a classic, except in the minds of those who like those kind of fluffy movies."
5,You've Got Mail,I can't see this enough!! I have watched the movie on my portable DVD player about 5 times and I watch it every time it is on the T.V.
2,"Oh no, not again!","Well, Sleepless in Seattle II, this time it's in the same state. I enjoyed the first one, emotion, humour and against the 'tropic of cretinsm' regard it as more appealing. Tom and Meg now look less compatible as poor old Tom has let it slide over the last few years (hair included). It has its moments, mostly when they are both not on the screen, but it could do with the Dallas act, the amnesia in the showers waking up as different people. These two do not know different ways of acting in a romantic comedy, so i find this passes the time but little else."
3,Finally Sleepless in Seattle done right!,"It was funny and romantic without being sappy or sugary. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though I wasn't expecting anything great. It is everything that Sleepless in Seattle isn't!. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were superb as usual. Highly recommended."
5,Fun stuff,"We've seen the movie 6 times, how's that? The writing is so good, you have to see it that many times to catch all of it."
3,SO-SO,THIS MOVIE REMINDED ME SOMEWHAT OF SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE. THE MOVIE WAS A BIT SLOW AND NOT ALL THAT CAPTIVATING. I MUST ADMIT IT WAS A CUTE MOVIE BUT I HAVE SEEN BETTER MOVIES FROM BOTH ACTORS
4,The Shop Around the Corner,"This movie is a modern version of ""The Shop Around the Corner"" featuring Van Johnson & Judy Garland. (also another version w/ James stewart) These three films are based on two main characters who worked together (despising each other, for various reasons) & have unknowingly begun a pen pal friendship. If you are a follower of Meg Ryan or Tom hanks you'll love this version just as much as I love The Shop Around the Corner. (my favorite) It's a perfect family movie. A light comedy , keeps the interest of people of all ages :)"
3,"Not as good as ""The Shop Around the Corner""","I thought is was good movie, and the e-mail thing was an interesting twist on 'The Shop Around the Corner', but who can beat James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan? I also agree with some of the earlier reviews that said that Tom Hanks is getting a little old for a role like this. This movie is defenitly worth seeing though, and there are alot of funny lines in it."
4,"A Cute, Feel Good Movie...","I just finsihed watching this movie and it *greatly* exceeded my expectations. I really didn't know what to expect, but since I am a Tom Hanks fan, I figured it couldn't be THAT bad. And to be honest I was pleasantly surprised! The reason I gave it four stars as opposed to five is because I felt the ending was rushed just a little bit too much compared to the rest of the movie and because of the few too many ""product placements"". Other than that I really enjoyed this movie. I would reccommend this movie to anybody who likes Meg Ryan or Tom Hanks or any body who wants to watch a 'cute' movie with a significant other on a rainy day!"
5,Romantic and very touching,"I love this movie very much. So many people have internet romance but how many turn out like this! When Meg broke up with her boyfriend and he asked her if there was someone else, she said ""No, but, there's a dream of someone else."" My tears run down. My dream will never come true now, but watching this movie really comforts me."
1,"Ugh, this movie left a bad taste in my mouth.","If you get to avoid seeing one movie this year, make it You've Got Mail! The only thing this film has going for it is Meg Ryan's beauty."
1,Boring..,"This was an interminally long exercise in going nowhere, I tried so hard to like it but it was too drawn out and predictable."
1,WHAT HAPPEND TOM...,"I am so shoked to see HANKS, such a good performer participating in such stupid movies, please save your money and stay home watching Ally Mcbeal...please tommmmmm..."
1,Disappointing,"Although I love both Ryan and Hanks, this sappy love story left much to be desired. The chemistry between them was great, but the writing was bad and I left the theatre feeling thouroughly let down. What a disappointment!"
1,more undeveloped characters,"After sleepless in Seattle, this pair continues to push out movies full of undeveloped characters. There's no deep thinking for this one, you already know whats going to happen so why see the movie?"
1,Boring and uninspired,"Very boring remake of a charming 1940's film ""The Shop Around the Corner."" The Ephrons totally blew it!! Best thing about the movie were the opening credits. Don't bother!!"
3,Better than expected but light fare at best,Despite my misgivings for seeing two very typical characters in an all too contrived situation I found myself enjoying (not revering) the movie.Meg Ryan's portrayals really have a way of annoying me. They all seem to be so outwardly confident without having the experience to have really gained any significant wisdom about anything other than the most generic or mundane. Her portrayals are all too typical of so many ..... females today. And in the end she usually discovers how wrong her previous assumptions were.Hanks' character is likable (as always) yet unsympathetic. It's hard for me to really root for or care about the rich son of a retail book entrepreneur even despite his father's shortcomings.Nonetheless I enjoyed it more than I expected too. It's at least worth a look. Just don't expect a whole lot more than simple amusement.
2,Unenjoyable,"This movie played on the fact that we like seeing these two actors work together and we wanted a cool ""e-mail"" movie. Too bad it didn't work out. Something in this movie makes you think it was thrown together without much thought. It could have been great. The ending leaves you hanging. I disliked it very much."
2,Quite cute but boring,"Thinking about who's in it - Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks - and about the up-to-date internet/chat/virtual reality topic I expected probably too much. The movie is a shallow story and wasn't especially funny, romantic or exciting nor had any new ideas in the content. It's a great movie for young teenagers and good for a rainy Sunday afternoon."
2,Leaves something to be desired,"The only reason I give this flick two stars is because I like looking at Meg Ryan. But this is the only movie I have ever felt like walking out on before it was finished. This movie wasn't the least bit entertaining, in fact, it seemed liked it was whipped together as an afterthought on the part of both actors. What's really sad is this doesn't help Tom Hanks. He makes awesome movies...why does he even bother with something so trite as this unless the money was phenomenal. It was hard to think that this actor was the same one I saw in 'Ryan'."
2,Such a disappointment from such great actors!,"OK as a freebie Sunday night made for TV movie. Not worth renting, let alone buying this one. Just goes to show that the names alone do not a movie make.Not much of a story -- ho hum characters -- predictable ending. What a combination for a bomb. A truly forgettable movie. Nothing stands out except that it was somewhat like Sleepless in Seattle.It's supposed to be a romantic comedy. So where's the romance and the comedy? It was more of a story about good friends who cybercommunicate on an intimate level, but have not formally met.Interesting story but not interesting enough to make a full length movie about. A half-hour episode would suffice. Maybe Tom and Meg should consider a weekly TV sitcom and leave the movies to someone else."
3,gift dvd,this dvd i have gave it as a gift to my girlfriend and i never watched it.so i didnt know what rating to give?this dvd came pkg and seal up great.no damage to it.
4,A romantic and funny movie,It's a modern romance apart from Sleepless in Seattle. It's a joy to see two enemies actually becomes lovers.
1,Darren & Samantha on-line?,"Boy is this movie a disappointment. The characters, especially those other than the 2 stars, have absolutely no substance, the dialogue is almost all pointless one-liners. It even looks awful. Nora Ephron's been watching too many late-model Woody Allen movies."
1,Tedious and pointless remake of The Shop Around the Corner,"This sickly, sentimental, leaden, inept and extremely dull remake of The Shop Around the Corner bored me to tears. Meg Ryan is her usual sweet, winsome, girlish little self, Tom Hanks is, well, Tom Hanks, frankly he isn't James Stewart. I mean, if you can watch James Stewart, why bother watching Tom Hanks? If you want to see a good film watch The Shop Around the Corner, don't bother with this tiresome remake. Shop Around the Corner isn't as good as Trouble in Paradise, but then what is?"
1,Absolutely not another Seattle!,"This movie was slow and did not have the same cute, warm-hearted feeling as ""Sleepless in Seattle"". I know it was not a sequal, but it was basically the same movie. I was very disappointed. Anyone renting this in hopes for another romance like ""Sleepless"", forget about it."
5,Love This Movie!,"Just a great movie! Ryan and Hanks are awesome. Funny, sad, touching and real life feelings - all perfect for a great movie! What more can I say? Buy it!Really good romantic comedy!"
3,A Very Pleasant Movie,"While not the best Nora Ephron - Meg Ryan movie (of course, that would be ""When Harry Met Sally""), this is a very pleasant date move that has lovely, charming performances by Hanks and Ryan. Fun look at bookstore wars (though Ephron has some sort of odd prejudice against chain bookstores that shows in the movie), as Hanks and Ryan play the opposing sides in the growth of the bookstore industry. Fun supporting performances by Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton and Greg Kinnear. DVD has some great extras, including a commentary by Nora Ephron, and a fun map of the locations with separate commentary by Ephron on each location."
4,"It's not the best, but it could be worse","Hanks and Ryan interact well together and it was nice having a movie make use of technology as an integral part of the plot - but it doesn't get 'nerdy' or technobabble-ish. I also enjoyed having the bookshops as I'm a great reader and haunter of bookshops and it's something I could identify with. Yes, it is v. cute and v. idealistic, but somehow you still feel happy at the end when they get together. There are some nice lines, the e-mail communication is done well, and overall it's pretty good. By the way, is it just me or does Kathleen Kelly not know much about Noel Streatfeild?"
4,Good Romantic Comedy,"When this movie first came out, I was like: 'OH Please . . . making a movie out of a three-word catchphrase?'But my sister rented it and I sat down to watch it, and I actually liked it. I was surprised. The story was funny and had some pretty original lines. Tom Hanks' knock-knock joke at the grocery line was classic. This movie did get boring at times, but overall it was one of the better romantic comedies. I could actually sit through it, so it had to be interesting."
4,Performances Charmed This Viewer...,"The script is an updated version... once used in Jimmy Stewart's "" The Shop Around the Corner"", once remade into a muscial for Judy Garland, ""In the Good Old Summer Time"". It has charm, wit and enough humanity to make it touching, funny and romatic."
4,A great story line!,"I thought that this movie had a great story line. It falls into the traditional love story category we have all grown to love. It's mix of emotion and humor are just right, and this movie helps to give you that wholesome feeling we all desire. Once again Tom Hanks does a great job in making a movie for every age. The only negative comment that I have about this movie is that I feel that the language content is not something that a PG audience should be exposed to. Other than that, it was a great movie."
4,A lighthearted and fun film to snuggle in front of,"In an effort to capture much of the warmth and chemistry between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, Director Nora Ephron paired the two up again in an antagonism-turned-to-love story about a bargain book tycoon and a children book store owner who battle during the day, and escape into a world of email and chat rooms -- only to find each other and fall in love, without knowing its the other person.This film doesn't require a lot of deep thinking, and its not the tear-jerker that Sleepless in Seattle is (I'm secure in my manhood - I can admit its a tear-jerker). There are no surprises, but its a fun film, you can't help but like the characters, and you know its all going to work out with them together in the end.Also of note are great performances by Greg Kinnear as the quirky boyfriend, Parker Posey as Tom Hank's selfish socialite girlfriend, Steve Zahn as Meg's dopey employee."
4,Surprisingly Good,This one looked to be so bad that it would be unbearable. It turned out to be an excellent storyline. It was almost believable. I have always enjoyed Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan together. I am glad that I watched it.
3,Fine,"This movie is a watch once for me. The plot is quite simple. Guy and gal are enemies in real but good friends over the net. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are good on screen couples but till the middle part, it is a bit too simple. not much excitment. overall, not as fantastic as it seems. Rent it."
2,Asleep In New York,"Forgive the unintentional ""sexism"", but this is one over-rated, trendy ""chick flick"", at least 20 minutes too long. It appears that Tom Hanks agreed with this sentiment, as he looks tired of the whole thing by the second Capuccino. Meg Ryan looks confused, as does Jean Stapleton, whose character in this thing I've yet to comprehend - a local/regional feminist heroine? (I'm gonna go back and watch ""The Money Pit""!...)."
5,"""You've Got Mail"" is superb!","I have always loved this film since the first time I saw it as a child. Getting the deluxe edition was a good choice for me because of the extra features, especially when they have Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, and Nora Ephron sitting down together ten years later reminiscing about the whole experience. This product was worth it!"
5,I love sweet movies!,This is just a nice sweet relaxing movie. I sometimes love to watch movies with happy endings and I love Tom Hanks.
2,not very good,"I thought this looked like a good movie, so I rented it, and boy, was I dissapointed. Everything was stolen from a different movie. It was basically sleepless in seattle with e-mail, but SIS wasn't even that good in the first place. The worst of all though, is that they used AOL. The movie seemed like a long AOL ad."
2,Charmless in New York,"This has little of the charm of the original ""The Shop Around the Corner,"" nor even that of the previous Hanks-Ryan pairing, ""Sleepless in Seattle.""What might have been a smart transplanting of the story to the 90s turns out to be banal, manipulative and hugely unfunny. Not to mention inconsistent: Ryan's defender of small neighborhood businesses jacks into the Internet through AOL and buys her coffee at Starbucks.Watch the original. Ephron, Ephron, Hanks and Ryan simply have nothing to add."
4,"AN UPDATE ON ""PILLOW TALK""","In ""Pillow Talk"" the two characters hate each other without even meeting each other! When they do meet they fall in love. Only Doris Day finds out who he really is and goes back to hating him! But of course they get together in the end! In this movie they have strong feeling for each other even though they never meet! They speak over the computer! WHAT A GREAT IDEA! I'm kidding of course! But in the ""real world"" they hate each other. Now is anybody starting to see the connection between the two? This is a movie for the hopeless romantic out there who feels love can come from anywhere! EVEN OVER YOUR VERY COMPUTER! SO I ASK YOU....WHO'S SENDING YOU MAIL?"
5,Chick flick,"What can I say, Hanks and Ryan work well together. This is also before Ryan got that botox done to her lips (which now makes her look like a fish). It's kind of neat to see the ""older"" technology with their computers too."
4,It's an enjoiable movie,"I did enjoy takink the movie. I do think that it's a very realistic movie, infact getting in love on-line is something really possible today. I must admit that the plot is not so interesting, and sometimes not so realistic becouse of the view of Manhattan that appear like a place full of happiness and peace. Anyway I would take the movie again, it's enjoiable."
3,Sleepless in New York,"This was Sleepless II, only not as charming or funny. The only thing that kept me awake was the great chenistry of Hanks and Ryan. It's watchable, but just barely. And who told Greg Kinear he can act?"
3,A totally disapointment!,What a waste of these two great actor and actress! Don't waste your time on it either.
3,It has its limitations,"I question the accuracy of this pedometer for extended whering. I trust it when ""going for a walk"", but I bought the device to track my daily steps. When I am just wearing it around it does funny stuff like reset and I don't know when, or count steps that haven't happened. My conclusion, it won't work for me to get a daily total of steps, but will work well to measure the steps/distance of a specific walk."
1,Disappointing,"This pedometer seemed to work fine the first few times I used it, but after several weeks I noticed it was way overcounting steps and distance. The time logged seems to be accurate though. I couldn't figure out why it would have one reading correct and the others incorrect. Seems I've wasted my money."
5,Great looking hat,"If you like the cleveland indians, this hat is for you! You won't find many people with it because it is isn't found in many places which is why I bought it."
5,Excellent shampoo with no SLS!,"My hair is to my tailbone, and requires special care to prevent dryness and breakage. This is the only shampoo I've found that allows me to wash the roots daily without drying out the ends. It leaves my naturally wavy hair silky and without frizz. The matching conditioner is excellent also - no alcohol!"
4,Mackenzies Mission,"This book follows the tradition of Linda Howard. I loved reading another installment of the Mackenzie family. Joe is the oldest son of Wolfe Mackenzie and is a jet fighter pilot. He meets an extremely intelligent yet naive young woman. Caroline's IQ is off the charts, but she knows next to nothing about love. She also teaches Joe about trust. It's a great book and I can hardly wait until Ms. Howard gives us the story of Joe's adopted brother, Chance."
5,McKenzie's Mountain & McKenzie's Mission both Must Reads,"Buy this book for both these fabulous stories with alpha heroes and their gutsy, brainy heroines. Love, love both these stories. This Native American father and son are tenderly portrayed, with humor and pathos. The big guys want so badly to protect their women, who end up showing that they are full participants in their own destinies."
3,Not as good as the first in the series...,"Although it was worth the time, it one wasn't as good as Mackenzie's Mountain. The relationship between Joe and Caroline wasn't near as well-developed or as believable as the one between Wolf and Mary. Although I cared about Joe, it was because of Howard's excellent characterization of him in the first book - not this one. I didn't care about Caroline near as much as I did Mary, and that's a shame... Joe deserved a love story every bit as wonderful and exciting as Wolf's and Mary's. But their story wasn't well-developed. The ""love"" happened too fast and was unbelievable. That said, it was an interesting read. It just didn't have the tension, the romance, or the spark of the first. A shame..."
4,Another winner,"Q: What do you get when you combine great dialog, believable plot, and steamy love scenes?A: Another winner from Linda Howard."
1,She did not do Joe justice,I loved the first book Mackenzie's Mountain- and Joe's character had a lot of potential but this book fell flat for me- I did not feel the chemistry for the 2 main characters- I hate when an author makes a girl go from virgin who has never dated to wanton sex goddess- not believable- and Joe falls madly in love after having amazing sex- it takes more than that to fall head over heels
4,Enjoyable story of lust and love.,"I loved the character Joe, whose natural abilities and hard work take him to the top in his field of air force fighter pilots. He is in charge of testing and developing a new jet. Caroline is on the project team. He tells her she should pretend to have a romance with him so the other pilots will leave her alone. This is the story of her romance with Joe. It was a nice story. There were bad guys as well. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: four. Copyright: 1992. Genre: contemporary romance."
5,MacKenzie's Warriors,"Love this series. Need to get books for two of the brothers, though. Are they out there? Josh and Michael."
2,Not as shown,Nemo and Dory look very bright and colorful in picture but in person there dull blue and orange and badly painted.
2,Happy Meal Toys,"The items came in sealed plastic McDonalds bags telling me that they were originally Happy Meal toys. I would have really appreciated being told that upfront. I likely would have ordered them anyway given the lack of Nemo party stuff available, but wouldn't have felt duped. Also, it says that these items are squirters. I have yet to take them out of their Happy Meal bags but they don't appear to squirt and are very hard plastic."
1,Useless,"Not only is this product time consuming (you have to calibrate the unit each time it's turned on), it's also mostly innacurate. After trying the product four our five times, I wound up only with holes in my walls, no studs.Buy this product, and make sure you have plenty of drywall anchors around your house!"
1,Worst tool I ever bought,"The Stanely's Intellisensor Pro is absolutely useless piece of junk. Since the time I bought I could not get it to detect any stud. Initially, I thought that I was not using it correctly so I asked several other people to use it. All of them came with the same disappointing results. Then a serach on internet revealed that almost all the people bought had the same results. What is disconcerting is that Stanley has not done a single thing to resolve this issue. Shame on Stanley. Next time, I will not be that trusting of Stanley tools."
1,Couldn't Find a Single Stud,"Amazon could do us a favor by pulling this product. My unit was unable to find a single stud. It didn't seem to matter if the wall was insulated or not, the result was the same. The wire finder would occasionally go off, but not in consistent places. From the other reviews, it looks like I'm not alone."
1,Intellisensor not that intelli!,To begin this product did NOT satisfy my needs in locating studs. I purchased this product and found it to be inconsistent in locating studs accurately. Ever time I re-caled the device I got different results. In addition the handling of the unit was awkward and not comfortable. I felt that metal locating and AC locating was also inaccurate. Due to this product I have 3 extra holes in my walls at home. I returned the device and purchased a MetalliScanner by Zircon. I found that product to work much better.
4,comfortable and cheap,"Forget about great sound with these, but it is adequate...the package said something about bass enhancement or such, but forget it. I've had others that had better bass. However, these are the most comfortable phones I've ever used, and I can sometimes almost forget that they are there. They don't produce much pressure on my ears. They are good for exercising, and the behind-the-head design seems most likely to stay on. The color looks good with the Sandisk m240(also good for exercise). Thecord is a decent enough length, too. For cheap, comfortable headphones for exercise or working out in the yard, these are hard to beat."
3,SpongeBob SquarePants - complete 2nd season DVD,"This DVD is just what is says that it is. I'm not a big fan of the series but the final episode on disc 2 is called ""Band Geeks"". As a musician and bandsman I found this episode really funny and accurate in too many ways.If you want a real laugh about a marching band buy this set and watch the last episode on disc 2 a bunch."
4,Shoes? We don't need no stinkin shoes!,"I never understood this episode. Why doesn't he just take his shoes off? I think they just didn't want to deal with a barefoot SBSP (and those consequences). I can understand wanting to teach kids to tie their laces, but this doesn't do it.I liked season 1 better, but season 2 is good family fun, too."
5,It's here!,"I have season 1, and im gettin season 2, 3,and 4, no matter what.Yes there will be a season 4 and from i hear, it's currently in development. Any way, i've seen the cover art for this dvd and i have to say it looks kinda cute same as the first one. Now, if you've seen the cute little sponge on television then you probably no that the animation is heaps better than the first season. And seems to make one dumb little starfish that we all now even dumber, a squid even more boring and a certain krab even more cheap! Plus, most of my favourite episodes are on this dvd so it's sure to be a pleaser. And I've heard that when you buy the boxset, you also get a free ticket to the spongebob squarepants movie! can't wait."
3,I can't believe it's missing something,"They dont have the three endings for shanghaied.I waiting so long for this season and sold all the other dvds on ebay(for a profit,lol)Now I have to go get sea stories again because they took away my extra endings.I hope season three has everything.I can't wait for the movie."
1,spongebob is the worst thing ever created,"I would rather do dishes, laundry, go to student teacher conferences or get into a car wreck than watch this horrible show..knock on wood"
2,BAD DVD,SCRATCHES ON THE DVDS. I DIDN'T MEAN TO BUY TWO OF THE SAME THING BUT DISSAPOINTED THAT THEY WERE SCRATCHED
2,Buffering problems!,Even as an adult I enjoy SpongeBob now and then. But my iphone had to stop and buffer every 2 or 3 minutes. Drove me crazy.
5,Back in the day when reality used to bite...,"In 1994 it was a total surprise to hear this awesome, yet-underground hit song; everything was alternative or ""Nirvana-oriented"" and I really was kinda fed up with that... then Lisa's extraordinary voice brought us that magnificent song with marvelous lyrics and killer tunes. ""Stay"" is one of the few songs that always makes me smile and remember those crazy 90's. Don't miss the opportunity to have one of pop music's trully wonders!."
5,Great song but PENNY SELLERS BITE!,"This is a great song with 2 versions. There is the one everybody's heard and then there is the Living Room Mix which is an acoustic version with no drums, electric guitars or bass.I wish these mega sellers would not exploit good music and the market by listing a ridiculously low prices. This song is better than that."
2,Poor quality,"This DVD was sent and the audio worked fine, but the picture began to cut out immediately. The screen would just cut to black while the audio was still working. Got it for a Christmas gift and was slightly embarrassed when I found out what was happening."
5,Michigan Ohio State The Rivalry,There's a lot of history here that even us grads didn't know. The video is well done and provides a fair assessment to both sides.
4,Great documentary,"As a huge Michigan fan, this was a must buy for me. I have to say HBO really did a great job putting this together. There were a number of things I learned about the rivalry that I didn't know before. There were a few issues I had, though. First, the video was short. It barely reached the hour mark. I realize that it was a ""Made-For-TV"" documentary, but considering the Fab Five documentary was in depth and informative, I was expecting more. Second, it was made in 2008. I was expecting there to be more of Jim Tressel, Lloyd Carr (there wasn't anything with Carr in the video) and the (then) current Ohio St-Mich rivalry. Third, I think they could've went further with the rivalry. In my opinion, and lots of other people's minds, it's the biggest rivalry in all of sports. I thought it should've been treated like that.Still, it was a very enjoyable watch and for what it is, it gets the point across."
2,Not Very Deep,"I thought the plot was a little shallow. And there was a little too much profanity for me -- wasn't really necessary for this particular film in my opinion. That being said, the scenery was beautiful. We'll probably watch it in the future for the scenery, but not necessarily for the plot."
5,A truly wonderful Romantic Comdey,This is one of my favorite movies! I've seen it good twenty times already; and I still laugh at some of the jokes. It is well worth the price to buy.
2,a cheap copy,This was the strangest video I've ever gotten from Amazon. It was like a cheap copy bought off a street vendor illegally. The quality was poor. The video defaulted to Spanish subtitles each time. It was not the quality tide expect Amazon to sell! I only have it 2 stars because I really love this movie.
4,CUTE AND FUNNY,"This romance story in Ireland is not the greatest 'chick-flick' or comedy ever made but very entertaining and loads of fun. The plot has been explained in other reviews, and little short Janeane does a stand-up job in holding her own with other fine actors. Of course, the scenery is outstanding and some of the driving scenes are hilarious. The brother's rivalry is also fun, and the matchmakers are serious about their intentions - very convincing acting...and some of the matchups are outrageously funny. Good movie!"
5,One of my favortie movies,This romantic comedy set in midst of an Irish matchmaking festival can only lead to good comedy. I laughed out loud and want to drink Guiness after watching the film. If you love this movie I would also recommend The Holiday & When Harry met Sally.
3,A Pretty Good movie :),"This movie depicts a dedicated political assistant (Janene Garofalo) who goes to Ireland in search of a family, and finds much more.Garofalo doesn't really break away from her typcasted role, being a jaded, cynical woman who doesn't really have time for love. She is convincing as always, and this movie has many humorous moments. It also has its share of moving moments, and the Irish background is perfect."
5,The Matchmaker,"I love, love, love this movie. Couldn't find it anywhere in Australia, so happy I found it on Amazon.com!"
2,bad language,A friend lent this movie to me & I am glad that I had not bought it. I couldn't get past the bad language to see if it was any good. Couldn't they have told this story without ever other word a curse word.
2,"Predictable, middling ""romantic comedy""...","This is a rather bland film. It is the usual boring, insipid romantic comedy that Hollywood should stop making, as they are so silly and unbelievable. Janeane Garofalo, who I consider an immensely intelligent person and who is a very underrated and underused actress, doesn't seem right here. She has a disdain throughout the film, like she doesn't really believe in the material. She's far too smart and cynical to really pull this kind of fluff off, even though, if they cast another actress, it would still be a middling film. The film is not horrible. It has its moments of charm and sweetness, and a few funny scenes. The biggest asset it has is that it's filmed in Ireland. The locations are magnificent, and the filmmakers should be commended for shooting there. The film would be absolutely abysmal if it was shot somewhere else. It's an OK, middling film, nothing more."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this DVD having never seen the film but being drawn into the prospect of a romantic comedy set in Ireland (it rang bells, for me you see). Oh how I wish this had been better - it was forumlaic and humdrum. The best scene in this movie is the singing competition which is the only reason I have awarded this film 3 and not 2 stars. If you want an Irish love story, watch The Quiet Man."
1,"Disappointing, especially for Garofalo fans","We found this video to have a rambling, disconnected story line with very few laughs. There are characters and side issues introduced with little relevance to the main story. We like Jeanine Garofalo - loved ""The truth about cats and dogs"", but found her and the entire cast to be flat and un-funny."
2,A Hollywood Irish film,"I bought the film based on the reviews. I thought it was a complete waste of time; a Hollywood take on Ireland. The leads are entirely unappealing and the cliches are nonstop (stupid politicians, the wonder of rural Ireland, I hate you, I love you love story). Also, the usual unnecessary profanity. Perhaps I saw a different movie?"
4,Really cute movie,"This is just a nice, feel good romantic comedy. Very cute, kind of funny. I like the lead guy, even though I can't remember his name right now. I also liked that they were not a typical hollywood-type couple. They look normal."
2,A Disappointment,This movie has beautiful scenery of Ireland but beyond that I can't recommend it. The acting is weak and the story hard to believe. There is a lot of offensive language that isn't really necessary to the story. The film never held my attention but did make me want to visit such a beautiful country.
5,Stitch in my side,"I love this movie. Cracks me up consistently, and there's a 'singing' competition I can't even watch because I'm laughing too hard."
5,The best irish movie I have seen,"The star of the movie is Ireland. They used actual Irish people, not American actors with phony accents, and the whole movie is utterly charming."
5,One of my favorites,"When I saw this movie, I totally just fell in love with it. I guess I was already a romantic comedy type girl, but this one really is great. I love the scenery, and the mood of the movie itself. David O'Hara is perfect, and all the other cast members are delightful. You must see this movie."
1,Horrible,"While there are some books that just don't fit your taste, this book goes well beyond. There are plenty of synopsis on previous reviews, so I won't rehash that here. In several spots, grammatical errors were not corrected, the plot has so many complications, it can't keep track of them, and the romance is awkward and shoved together. This reads like a poorly written first draft, not a published novel. I saw the ending coming from the first chapter.Add to that the author maligns homosexuals with her stereotypical descriptions and determination to make them the bad guys.I have no idea how this kind of tripe gets published, but highly recommend trying out some other cozy mystery -- not this one."
1,Keep your router,"This is merely a high priced router. They market this to the average computer user but you better be an IT technician to understand how this works. Now, tech support for it is 99.00/hour. I'd return it (to Sam's Club) if I was in the time frame. One star is too much."
2,Lou's most uninteresting failure,"This album has three or four great songs: Vicious circle, Temporary thing, I believe in love maybe Ladies pay, Senselessly cruel and the title track.But Follow the leader, Banging on my drum, Chooser and the choosen one and Claim to fame are just nonsense that made me dissapointed."
4,"""Ladies Pay"" Worth Any Amount of Money!","At last we get somebody who's got the brains to put this album on CD (which Arista hasn't done for us here in America). ""Ladies Pay"" is one of Lou Reed's very greatest songs and it has appeared on none of his compilations. If he's so (very justly!) proud of his solo on this great song why hasn't he included it on any of the compilations? Who knows--but here it is at last, so grab it immediately! This song is worth the price of any album."
1,Beautiful Blue But Broke Within 2 Weeks,"Arrived quickly and well packaged. Unfortunately, this case is just a hard plastic (well, not that hard really)and while it snapped on easily and looked amazing on my grandson's Nokia N97, the little tabs snapped off, and corners or opposite sides cracked within 2 weeks of use. Utterly useless. Shame really, cause the color rocks."
3,Perfect book for teaching writing or poetry,"I was able to gather numerous ideas for interesting and engaging writing assignments for my junior English classes. It is difficult to keep your students interested in writing today, and this book will help teachers immeasurably."
5,Whoo!,"I was worried this book wouldn't arrive in time for the new semester, as it was required reading for a class, but it was here in a day! Fantastic!"
2,Dead Poets,"I agree that this book is reminiscent of ""Dead Poets Society,"" for it teaches us that poetry is primarily an affective exercise, a kind of therapeutic expression of one's deep thoughts and dangerous experiences. The authors would have us believe the heart of poetry is large idea and grandiose confession. They seem to overlook the beauties of precision and quiet interlocking of words on several semiotic levels. ""Is this a dagger I see before me?"" Nope. It's just a letter opener."
4,The Poet's Companion Will Work For You.,"Excellent book. The exercises are phenomenal. I tried the exercise that gives you about 14 words you must use in the body of your poem,. From this exercise I wrote two poems. One abstract and one long. Each poem was published. I also did the exercise with a suggested title, this was published. Kim and Dorriane give you clear examples of different types of poetry. The authors knowledge is so deep you learn the inner life of quality poetry and what makes a poem resonate to others. I recommend this book to any aspiring poet. This book is priceless."
5,No excuse not to write like a maniac,"This terrific handbook contains not only logical and stimulating discussions of the subjects and styles that make up poetry--it also has a treasuretrove of writing exercises, a la Hugo's ""triggering town,"" that spur on even a poet in a lethargic phase to experiment in a wide range of poetic possibilities. The suggestions for writing are some of the best I've ever seen; I'll be using many of them in my teaching.Functional AND entertaining. With this book by your side, there's no excuse not to Write On."
3,For adult writers...,"Although I don't doubt this is a great book for writing poetry- I thought I would mention that it is for adults. I read the reviews and ordered the book for my 14 year old who loves to write poetry- thinking the reviews made it sound perfect. The content does include adult topics, sexual language, and some language. Just thought others may find this helpful to know. I sent it back, as it was not appropriate for my daughter."
5,Best coffee!!!!,This was my first time trying Red Buffalo Coffee and I was so pleased when I took my first sip! I tried Blueberry Cobbler decaf and it is AMAZING! I have tried many different brands of flavored coffees and Red Buffalo is by far the best! The flavor is rich and the aroma makes me want to drink it all day!
3,Interesting.,"Having been an avid Tom Clacy reader since 'Red October' I have to admit to being slightly disappointed in this film of his NetForce book. The acting by Bakula is excellent as usual. But I found having read the books that it strays too far from the plot, even allowing for editorial license. Having said that it was still enjoyable to watch."
1,netforce movie was hideously slaughtered,"opening of the movie doesnt even exist in the book,book starts with the LIMO ambush and Steve Day killing one of the Russians and getting killed himself. theres about 2 hours or more in the movie that doesnt happen in the book..very bad movie,i was anxious to watch the movie after reading the book..a waste of a $3 dvd rental and my 2.5 hours"
3,Great With Knowledge from th book,"Ok, Some people say this is the worst thing Clancy ever put his name to, and their probaly right. I suggest that before viewing this movie read the corresponding book, to see how the charcters do develop and the plot unfolds. As for the movie everything is rushed and inappreciated, but since it carries the name Clancy you can almost be assured that whatever is the movie or book has some bearing and isn't complete rubbish"
3,I enjoyed this mini series and hope there will be more,I must confess that I enjoyed this despite the fact it has the worst side break I've ever seen. I hope this is only the first of a series.
2,Clancy must not research his movies as much as we thought,"Very inaccurate depiction of computers. Tom Clancy, i thought you were highly touted as being a realistic researcher of the details... how did you flub this one so bad?"
4,Net Force Rocks,"Loved this movie for the most part, especially Scott Bakula and Chelsea Field. It was nice to see them together again in a movie. It has plenty of action and some nice moments between Scott and Chelsea and Alex and his daughter. The plot has a neat twist at the end."
1,Worst thing to carry Clancy's name,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing it had going for it was Tom Clancy's name in the TITLE! Their idea of technology 20 years from now is like ""Back to the Future"" on steriods. They used cheap gimicks like refering to ""Star Wars 7"" and an online court. They didn't even get many of the technological terms right! The acting was worse than daytime soap operas. The plot was nonexistant. The only good thing was the quality of the explosions. They were done well, but they were every five minutes... This is pure fantasy and anyone who has reached puberty won't buy it. This isn't a Tom Clancy flick. It is pure rubbish."
1,choppy clint eastwood style non-sense,"I just watched this from an old VHS movie I got for $1 at the library. Scott Bakula tries to play a tough fearless agent working for the FBI but comes across as a Clint Eastwood wannabe. Cute and sexy Joanna Going plays his loyal admiring sidekick and does a good job keeping one's interest. Other than that, the storyline could have been taken from a Captain Marvel comic book with a little folksy dinner table chat thrown in which instead of warming one's heart makes one want to vomit the dinner."
3,"Good, but like most Clancy movies made from books, DIFFERENT","The movie was good, but I'm suprised Clancy allowed his book to be changed this much to fit the viewers. I realize movies are always different than their book counterparts, but come on!! This was quite hard to follow after reading the book, of course me yelling ""That didn't happen in the book!"" didn't help matters."
3,Lousy for Popcorn,"I mostly use a microwave to heat food & cook frozen food and to pop popcorn. I've had this for about 6 years. It's OK, but really lousy for popcorn. I've tried every brand of popcorn, every type of popcorn made by each brand, tried sitting the bag on top of an inverted glass pie pan, and it still burns burns burns without popping all the corn. Bummer."
2,didnt get it,"i missed the point and am frustrated that i kept reading, waiting for the story to evolve. characters were not developed well and lots of loose ends. perhaps if i ""got"" whatever the rave reviewers did i would have enjoyed it."
2,Not interesting until 2nd half,I didn't understand a thing for the first half of the book. None of the dialog or text seemed important. Only at about 40% in (on my Kindle) did it get more interesting. I finished it because I was hoping it would get better. It did make me think at the end. I'm not going to re-read it though to get more out of it. Pretty much wasted my time.
3,Decent,"A decent start for a young author that could grow quite well if he refines himself a bit.The story is convincing, for the most part, and it's entertaining to watch the characters interact. You could read more into it, but nothing really warrants much more of an analysis than The Breakfast Club, a moderately similar story.Still entertaining, though. The bulk of the book is simply interaction between the characters as they're trapped, and this interaction has some neat surprises, though the characters themselves don't seem to offer as much distinction as they should.Still, a budding author that could be one to watch. Interestingly the movie gained notoriety for a budding starlet revealing more than many expect. Stole some of the thunder from the plot I'm sure..."
4,The Hole,"Like many of the other reviewers, I thought this book was very good, but at times confusing. The book switches back from the people in the hole, to someone's life before the hole, and after. The catch is,you don't know who is the narrarator until the end. This book is definitely one you may have to read over, but is very well-written. A definite worth-while read."
2,I Was Sent the wrong colored watch band!,"I love the watch but it was not the pink band that I ordered, I got a brown band but I am not sure if I should bother to send it back or not."
4,Thorough but definitely professorial,"This is not really the type of book I would normally buy. It is very dry, and I struggled to follow. I guess I do better with a narrative format, one that has stories and anecdotes that bring the history to life. Hilberg is obviously an historian of the highest level, but there is a reason I love history, but never much enjoyed college history classes. The book is well researched, and I must say that it offered me many great insights. I guess i just need to be more selective with the format I choose. Still, I have to give this a good recommendation, based on the thoroughness and documentary evidence provided."
4,Solid film with slow pacing and outstanding plotline,Good movie for serious science fiction fans who enjoy an intelligent and realistic view of the future. Dern does an outstanding acting job and plays his part with that extra dimension of sincerity.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The special effects are still impressive and the movie definitely has moments of power and achievement, but Bruce Dern doesn't have the chops to carry the movie when the other humans are gone and the middle section lags as a result; it's worth a look if you like sci-fi but it's less than stellar."
4,What would you do?,One of Bruce Dern's best and one of the first solid 'man/environment v corporate exploitation' adventure films. Perhaps the seeds of Avatar were planted here.
4,Good old childhood movie,I ordered this movie because I loved it when I was younger. The special effects are really outdated but I still fall in love with the robots. It also gives a perspective on what could be on Earth without plant life. Something to think about.
3,"Serious Message, Slow Movie","Not bad Sci-Fi for the 1970's, ""Silent Running"" is a movie with an environmental message. Here are my observations:Pros:Good Sci-Fi PlotGood MessageGood Special EffectsCons:Bad ActingMoves Very SlowlyThis could have been a very good movie if the acting was up to the message!CFH"
1,Zzzzzz -- terrible,"This is one of the most ridiculous sci-fi DVD's I have ever seen. The dialog between the Valley Forge and the other ship is ridiculous. Dern talking to the two driods is pathetic. If I had to see one more close up of Dern's flared nostrils I was going to puke. I definitely would not recommend this DVD to anyone. It is very dated, boring, with terrible acting, directing and dialog."
1,Was It All a Joke? Did It Go Over All Our Heads?,"Because Doug Trumbull -- a pioneering special-effects technoweenie -- was the guy who initiated ""Silent Running"" (to use some of the special effects techniques he developed for ""2001,"" he said), I have sometimes toyed with the idea that the whole thing was an elephantine _parody_ of '70s environmentalism.The presence of Bochco and Cimino as writers has made me -- reluctantly -- discard this delicious notion, though.Cimino, so far as I can tell (read Steven Bach's ""The Final Cut,"" about Cimino and the ""Heaven's Gate"" fiasco that was the final straw for United Artists) _has_ no sense of humor.And Bochco was the writer for a ""New Twilight Zone"" episode that was, if anything, even more redolent of New Age moonbattery than was ""Silent Running."""
2,out-dated in filming,The movie could be considered good in 80s but special effect cannot be compared with todays space movie. It is not a worthy DVD collection.
1,Tree Huggin' hippy crap,"There's no 0 stars option? Sup wit dat? I don't know why anyone in thier right mind considers this peice of dreck a Sci-Fi Classic. The box to this movie promises it to be ""the lonliest adventure ever"".. which in lamen's term means ""A boring movie where absolutly nothing happens!"" This is one of those movies that you only watch because you're thinking ""Something really cool is about to happen.. any minute now"", and it doesn't. In fact, this movie is the most uneventful thing I've ever seen. It's a guy planting trees and talking to cardboard box robots for 2hrs! Avoid this film like the plauge."
1,The worst movie period.,"The worst movie, very slow with a poor acting. Unless your a greenpeace nut don't bother......."
5,Visual comfort food,"I loved this movie since it came out in 1971, when I was a teenager and fanatical ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" fan, so it remains a sentimental favorite. The best parts, of course, are the drones: Huey, Dewey and (dear departed) Louie. When I watch it now, I'm only slightly disturbed by poorly thought out plot elements... like Freeman Lowell's prolonged puzzlement over the cause of his plants' mass die-off, only to discover in a moment of satori that he's too far away from the sun, so the plants aren't getting enough light. Ahem. Isn't he supposed to be a botanist? Anyway, despite that, I love it still."
5,"A Classic, must-see for Sci-Fi fans","Silent Running clearly had a major influence on future films such as Star Wars and even Wall-E, which has a similar theme. Excellent special effects considering no CGI (this was the early 1970s). Highly recommended. The book is good too."
2,Boring movie with a rather suspect message,"Being a sci-fi buff, I gave this movie a try since it's considered ""one of the best sci-fi movies of the 70's"". Twice, I fell asleep and had to force myself to the ending.In my opinion, the only redeeming factor of this movie is watching the robots. It seems this movie places the value of plants over human life and says it's ok to kill people as long as you have Peter Frampton hair. Only tree-huggers need apply."
4,Classic SF of the early 70s,"Long a favorite of mine, this DVD version is very good. If nothing else, it shows how the cultural climate of the times finds its way into a movie. The ""Making of"" feature is almost worth the price itself. Find out why the ship is named ""Valley Forge"", and how they made those little robots work. While many slam the Joan Baez songs, I think they are the essence of the movie and convey the feelings of the time in which the movie was made. In fact, I held back one star because they don't include the songs ""Rejoice in the Sun"" and ""Silent Running"" as separate cuts and the soundtrack album is long out of print."
1,Terrible,"This movie is unimaginably terrible. Overacting, underacting, a very thin plot with no development, poorly edited, and overall just plain sucky. The worst part is once you see the end of the movie you start questioning the whole reason for the movie to even have a reason for being made. Nothing is accomplished, nothing is resolved. This is just a bad, bad movie."
1,Science Farce,"Doug Trumbull's special effects are the only reason to watch this movie, but this is the worst script ever.Whoever came up with the idea that a botanist wouldn't know that plants die without light was partaking of a bit too much of the local flora.Bruce Dern's portrayal of an emasculated, uneducated, puerile, whining victim was fantastic. I think he caught the true essence of the flower-child movement."
1,If a tree falls on this movie and nobody is watching....,"I have only walked out on two movies in my lifetime -- this was one of them. Absurdly bad acting from Bruce Dern, whom I have generally liked in movies and TV. I like sci-fi, love movies, but couldn't suspend my disbelief for this."
1,I'm being generous,"The only reason I gave it a 1 is because I couldn't give it a 0. It is totally stale. If you are a fan of sci-fi, chances are you'll have to fight to stay awake. The look and feel of the robots is about the one and only redeeming quality of this film. Avoid it like the plague, even on earth day."
5,From a time when preservation was referred to as the Ecology.,"""The Ecology"" was a very serious issue in the 1970s and we seem to be back to again now. This film presents what happens when the earth becomes so polluted and over populated that forests are preserved by sending them into space until things can be changed and they can be returned to where they belong.The unfortunate result is it doesn't happen that way and the order is given to destroy the forests as they will not be returning to earth after many years of preservation in space. A conservationist, played by Bruce Dern, decides to take matters into his own hands.This film is a combination of Science Fiction coupled with ""The Ecology"" issue and they were even able to get Joan Baez to perform some of the music for the film.This is a great film and a must have for collectors of Sci-Fi!"
3,A movie for space hippies.,"This movie was made with the 1970's counterculture in mind. An eco-science fiction film, Bruce Dern plays an ecological nut-case who present viewers with the fears that our world will end if we don't take care of it. The robots are cool, effects decent, but the songs by Joan Baez are horrible, and have no place in this film."
2,Seems so 'dated',"At this point, this film seems so outdated and the production quality and 'technology' feels more like a made-for-TV episode than a feature film.I failed to remember any of this when I first saw the movie years ago, and purchasing to watch again was a big letdown."
2,Silent Running,"After reading many of the review's that people have given, I come to one conclusion! Sometimes a 5 cent cigar is just a 5 cent cigar. I have seen this movie several times, it was never meant to be a 'classic' or anything other then what it is (was), a movie to entertain for that time. I had more than a passing interest in seeing the movie. The set used to make it was a old U.S. Navy ship by the name of the USS Valley Forge. In 1969, while traveling in convoy to Hawaii with many other ships, mine included, it ran into another ship, mine. So, I do remember it well.Being a Sci-Fi fan (nut), I really enjoyed this film, as I do many others, but please, when you watch this movie, DO NOT compare it by today's standards. It was a good movie for it's time, yes, flawed and dated, but still fun to watch and remember."
4,"Good, but not the best in the series","To me the whole idea of Steve and Carol getting back together for the sole purpose of her getting pregnant just seemed crazy, but this book was still a fun and quick read."
3,Book,Have read the series and wanted to continue the story. I have enjoyed it and then passed it on for others.
2,Hero got on my nerves!,"The hero got on my nerves! He was such a jerk. He believed that his wife had an affair and that she was carrying another guy's baby almost right up until she gave birth. And the heroine never really did much to change his mind, but let him go on and think poorly of her. Plus, why would he want to be with her if he thought so poorly of her? Give me a break! Debbie Macomber's other navy stories are better."
3,Good Story,"The Adventures of Captain Horn was a very good story. There were great lessons and morals to be learned. I did find the writing style a little tedious to read, but it was a very good book. I enjoyed the story."
3,WHAT THE BLAZES IS THIS BOOK ABOUT?,Does anyone know what this book is about? I've looked all over and cannot find any info.I rated the book only because the system forced a rating.
1,Not worth it,"I bought this stroller because I wanted a side-by-side model that was lightweight and easy to manuver. What a joke! This is by far the worst stroller I have ever used. Forget walks outside with this, it will catch on every crack and stick you run over. I have walked my son and his friend (both 19 months, around 25 Lbs. each) in this stroller in a variety of enviroments (grocery, mall, around the block, to the park, ect.) and I cannot say anything good about this waste of money. It is very hard to manuver and turn. It is a constant fight. If you're trying to find a good stroller, this is NOT it."
4,Stokes Field Guide to Birds: Eastern Region,"The book was fine - just what I ordered. I was disappointed it took approx. 9 days to arrive because I had wanted to give it for a birthday gift. However, the book was in good condition just like the website said it was."
2,Adequate,"This is an adequate resource for a novice birdwatcher and it is well-organized. However, after testing this book in 3 Western wildlife refuges, I've decided that I would like more information on the behaviors and habits of each bird. I am by no means a ""bird geek,"" but am simply seeking to know more about the natural world as I hike or row through it. The book provides little more than just name, rank, and serial number. Also, although the photography is mostly sharp and useful, some of the seagoing bird photographs are blurred and grainy, resembling a Bigfoot photo. I have been looking for the ultimate guide to Western birds but I'm going to keep looking."
5,A must have book for birders of all skill levels!,This book is amazingly great in detail. You are given an actual photo of the birds (summer and winter varieties) as well as nesting and feeding habits. Wow! What more can I say! I'm thrilled to be an owner of this book!
5,SUPERB FIELD GUIDE WITH LARGE PHOTOS!!!,"I recently got into this hobby of birding, and was looking for a good book to take with me on weekend jaunts, or to I.D. birds in my backyard. I am by no means a professional, but a casual birder. For that purpose, this fantastic book is much more than adequate! I like to 'check off' each corner page when I spot one of the birds shown, and the real color photos are an invaluable tool! Just this morning, this gorgeous Red Shouldered Hawk was sitting on a fencepost (was visiting my brother in the Cleveland, Ohio area), and I was able to readily I.D. it using this book. My next purchase will be a pair of digital binoculars with a built in digital cam. That way, I will be able to take a snapshot of these critters, and I.D. them later, if I can't at that moment! Plus, all the information on each bird is on one page! This is really a fascinating hobby, and I am glad to own this book (and the Western version) as my first guide! I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent Pictures,"This book is great. I would not consider myself a bird watcher but we have a bird feeder outside and it's interesting looking the birds up in the Stokes guide. The pictures are fantastic and it's good that it's only Eastern birds, so it makes it easier to identify the ones in my area.Our kids really like it too and it makes it interesting to learn new facts. If you never realized what the visual differences are between male and female birds, it's worth it for that alone.Get a bird feeder and get the Stokes guide, it's a great combination."
5,a swell field guide,We have half a dozen bird books on the shelf but Stokes is the field guide that is being tossed in the bag or kayak for bird identification.
5,Perfect!!,"This is the perfect book for a bird lover. Any questions you have, you can find in this book. The pictures are great for identifying the birds. You will not be dissapointed!!"
2,There are Better...,"Simply put, there are better guides out there. After all I read about Stokes guides, this Stokes guide was a big disappointment. Most of the photos are blurry, grainy, terrible! Many photos are very small. Also, for many birds, there is only one photo per bird, so there is no juvenile, female, variations. And many of the photos show odd angles and/or lighting. I did like the layout of the information and the way you can find birds by color, but found it to be more useful, after you ID the bird, using another field guide. This book does have interesting tidbits about a birds habits/lifestyle. There is not much ID/field mark info. This should not be called a ""field guide"", but maybe a reference book. Hope this helps..."
3,Much better than most,"After using many inadequate field guides, this became my standard guide. Now I use it with the Sibley's field guide (the BEST field guide out there). Between the two of them, I have all the information I need. The photographs are a great complement to Sibley's drawings. But the photos often lack many of the important field marks. And the regional variation in some species may make the pictures useless or worse, misleading. Juvenile and female pictures are often missing. Many occasional visitors to New Mexico are missing from this book, although the common species are there. The maps are pretty good. The behavioral, feeding and breeding info is very helpful. It's a great resource for the backyard birdwatcher, and a good supplement for the serious birder."
5,Love it!!,I bought this set for my Dad. We would listen to books on tape during long road trips And we were hooked! Listened to all three books in 1 trip!!! Good stuff!!
4,Key of Valor,"I really enjoyed the overall ending in this book to complete the trilogy. I would have liked the 3 heroines of the trilogy to have kept the money, but I liked all the other choices they made. I thought all 3 of them each earned the 1 million dollars each and I really wanted to see them get it. It wouldn't have hurt the Gods at all to give them the money granted and earned."
4,Great finish to trilogy,Exciting to the end. Great fantasy. Hard to put down. I think I liked this book the best of the three
2,Not the best of the series,"I liked books 1 & 2 better. However, I read this because I wanted to finish the trilogy and see how it all turned out! This was the weakest of the three but still mildly entertaining. Zoe is not as likable as Dana and Mallory so I had difficulty relating with her experiences. This book is not as good as other works by Nora Roberts. This is probably my least favorite by her and I am a big fan."
3,I enjoyed the book but the first one was the best.,"Maybe it was just me, or that my expectations were too high, but as I was reading this trilogy it felt like the author had fallen in love with the idea in the first book, carried it through in the second, but was bored with it by the third. This was not a bad book, but when compared with the first two, it seemed like she pushed the fun and intriguing paranormal aspect of the story to the side and fell back on letting the romance side of the story carry the last book. I began wondering if the heroine would ever have to fight the villain at all.Even though, it did bring closure to the story and was an enjoyable read. (Even if I had been hoping for more of the paranormal aspect.)"
5,Loved it!,"I really enjoyed the entire key trilogy. I was visiting Arkansas for a week when I finished the second book and I did not have the third book, or a library I could go to and borrow one, and I absolutely had to read it. So i bought it, and read it in less then a day! I loved it!"
3,I wish I had read the Reader's Digest Condensed version,"I have mixed feelings about the three books in this series. I liked the basic stories in Key of Light, Key of Knowledge, and Key of Valor but thought all three books moved so slowly that I almost didn't finish the final book. I think I would have enjoyed reading about Malory, Dana, and Zoe much better if all three books had been condensed and consolidated into one book with three sections. I hate feeling this way because I am basically a big Nora Roberts fan but with my apologies to Ms. Roberts, these books just did not appeal to me."
2,Weak,"I have read the three books in this line and I find them lacking.Ms Roberts could have taken this series to a deep level with myths and stories, but she chooses to dump usless storylines on us. The books could have been richer, she has done this in the past. I feel that she threw this together."
3,"Be careful about reading ""Wonderful conclusion"" below",The reader who wrote it gave away too much of the ending and makes a misstatement about Zoe and her mother. Book was okay. not as good as the first two.
2,Great Read,If you like a book that can transport you for a while then this is the light read for you
3,Okay,"I guess I am the only person that couldn't wait to get to the end of the book because it almost put me to sleep. Nora Roberts's trilogy stories have so much promise, but this one just didn't have very any zing or spark. I gave it three stars because the writing had a nice flow and the characters were likeable. This book doesn't require much concentration, which would make it good reading material for a lazy day."
5,Wonderful conclusion........................,"I bought this book today and believe it or not I just completed the book. Nora has a wonderful way of bringing her trilogies to a conclusion. Zoe and Brad were well paired thru this book. Simon, her son became more endearing to me in this book, and even Crystal McCourt Zoe's mother came around at the end. Zoe called on to find the final Key to liberate the sleeping ladies finally finds it and ends up killing Kane as well. It couldn't have a happier ending. I highly recommend this book, even if you have read the other 2 books in the series this final one ends it beautifuly. Read this book, you will be glad that you did."
4,Key of Valor,"The book was in excellent condition, no marked or crimpled pages. The only thing missing was the dust jacket."
5,Key of Vlor,The book arrived in escellent condition. No one would have ever guessed that it was used.
4,handy and versatile,"This tape makes spot measurements easy. It is accurate, and the function to find the middle of a board is particularly useful... just press a button and the current measurement is instantly halved. My only wish would be that the display be mounted on top where it could be more visible. Otherwise, it seems quite durable and continues to serve me well."
1,TOO BIG,"It doesn't matter what kind of functions this tape has, there is one major problem with it- it is too big and heavy. I have the largest sized hands of anyone I know, and I could barely hold on to it with one hand without dropping it... let alone using the thing. Prepare to grow a third arm if you are going to order it, two arms to hold the thing, and a third to operate the tape. The pictures are very decieving. (...)"
2,Needs concentration,"I am in the window treatment business and use for measuring for blinds, shades, etc. I find that the buttons for inside/outside, midpoint and others can easily be touched and change the measurement. I have to constantly check the mode before and after taking the measurement, its quite annoying and I have made more mistakes this than with standard measuring tape. Also, the size of the case does not allow pocketing or placing in most tool belts, but on the other hand, it doesn't hide easily."
1,Unending agony,"Although I have read several good Danielle Steel books, this one really disappointed me. It is page after page of stomach knotting agony- one hard to read situation after the other for the entire book. The premature, unsatisfying, short ending does little to make up for the endless torture that preceded it."
3,Solid Danielle Steel.,"Leap of Faith is an enjoyable story split between the cosmopolitan France, and down-home Iowa. It is a fast-paced well-written jaunt into the life of a young woman, Marie-Ange.Her life is turned upside down by a tragic car crash, and she is sent to live with her aunt in Iowa. Unfamiliar with the midwest, Marie-Ange has much to adjust to. Her aunt's eccentricities make life no easier for her.However, Marie-Ange's story does not end with her upheaval as a child. The story follows her life and the people she meets along the way, good and bad. It becomes an engaging story of a young woman and the trials of her life.If you enjoy Danielle Steel you will certainly enjoy this book as well. It is well-written, engaging, and interesting. It will leave you guessing, and keep you reading with the roller-coaster ride of a story it offers... Enjoy!"
2,Abrupt Ending,"This book had a good baseline story, but the main character Marie-Ange is unrealistically naive for a girl who had such a hard life. If she really led the life portrayed in the book, she would have grown up quickly and her education would undoubtedly only added to her maturity, not made her such a naive nitwit as she is portrayed in the book. Even so, the book made okay reading until the ending, which was so very abrupt and unfinished. It just leads you to wonder, after all that--is that it????"
1,Not worth it,This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there.
2,Not her best work,"The main character, Marie Ange is loveable as a child, but I felt rather indifferent to her through the rest of the story.I was highly disappointed in the ending of the story. Though her husband was obviously a villian, you never really saw much of a strength in Marie Ange that I had grown used to reading in the older books. There were a lot of unsatisfied questions left when I put this book down. I would not recommend it.It seems to me that many of her more recent stories are just the same basics with different names and locations. I'd like to see some more of the variety that she used to have in her work."
3,Leap of Faith,"This was my first encounter with the work of Danielle Steel. I found it to be an overall good story. In the first part of the book you get to know Marie-Ange and there's a very good description of her life and her friendship with Billy. After she inherits money, she goes back to France and gets married. Here's when the trouble begins. Her husband may not be who he appears to be... This part of the story had a great potential which it doesn't quite live up to because Marie-Ange, who seemed like a smart girl, now turns into a much too naive, almost stupid character. It made it hard to really feel sympathy for her problems, because she could have avoided so many of them. This, and a climactic sequence that was a bit too short keeps the book from getting four stars. But ""Leap of Faith"" is overall an enjoyable, quick read."
5,Great Book!,I really enjoyed reading this book! I had a hard time putting the book down. Very neat ending.
2,Interesting,"This book had a really good story line but I had to push myself to keep reading. If you push yourself it is really good, especially if you like endings where you have to predict what happened. I think I will be extreamly nice to all the people I meet from now on, in hopes that maybe one day someone might give me a Porsche!"
4,A quick read!,"Although this book read VERY fast,I liked it. If you only have an afternoon at the beach,then pick it up at the library and take it along. It's pretty light reading. I think the ending could have been expanded,but other than that,it was good."
3,Easy and Simply,"For the sake of those who have not read the book,I do not want to give away the plot or the outcome of the story. But, I can recommend the book to anyone who likes to read a good story that is short, easy to read and the end of the story is easy to figure out early in the book. I enjoyed reading the book. It held my attention so I read it quickly."
2,Have I read this before?,"I have read almost every book that Danielle Steel has written and I must say, this time she should have pushed herself away from the typewritter and taken a break. She has written the same story over and over. Her books used to have much more depth to them. Marie is the same ignorant girl that has been the main character in her more recent books. I was never able to determine what time period this was supposed to take place in but I have to wonder where the people were that were supposed to watch over this poor little orphan back in France. If you want real good Danielle Steel you would be better served to read No Greater Love or Kalidescope. Come on Danielle, your true fans deserve better."
2,NO FAITH IN STEEL,THIS BOOK WAS A VERY EASY READ. I FINISHED IT IN ABOUT THREE HOURS. I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE STORYLINE IT WAS SO PREDICTABLE. THE ONLY SURPRISE WAS HOW MARIE FOUND OUT ABOUT HER HUSBAND. I WISH I HAD GONE TO THE LIBRARY AND GOT THE BOOK INSTEAD OF PAYING [MONEY] FOR IT. I AM SLOWLY BECOMING A DANIELLE STEEL UNFAN. HER LAST FEW BOOKS FOR ME HAVE LEFT SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED.
1,Don't take this leap,"I use to be a huge Danielle Steel fan, adoring her books such as The Ring, Message from Nam, Wanderlust, etc. I stopped reading her books after reading The Ranch. The worst book I ever read. I thought I'd give her one more try by reading Leap of Faith. She's clearly only in it for the money now - cranking out garbage. Leap of Faith was too predictable with shallow, uninteresting characters. I won't be wasting my time on her books again."
1,no faith for leap of faith,"if the author's name weren't danielle steel, the manuscript would have been tossed in the circular file by any/all publishers. what a waste of time!!"
3,Strength and Endurance,"Sadness for this little girl who so quickly found herself withoutthe love and security of her family was what grabbed me. And then, she was deceived so grandly that I just had to keep reading to be certain that she found her way ""home"". This was just another great book in Danielle's ever growing list of titles."
5,Here is reality!,"If you are seeking the Lord Jesus Christ, read this treasure! It is a great example of the work of the Holy Spirit in His Body. Learn more of what the forgotten Apostle is saying to the Bride of Christ! Great book!"
3,A dated perspective...,"CAPT Hughes work was a seminal realization for the waning Cold War Navy. The application of small, fast, networked craft in a mass assault against surface fleet elements was riveting and a telling indicator of our present (2007) military situation. What CAPT Hughes failed to adequately factor into his work was the impact of economics, improved missile capability and survivability.Hughes makes the error of fighting the last war (in his mind WWII) in the present day. The USA has abandoned ships of the line (CGs and the like) in favor of ESG (expeditionary strike groups). He works valiantly to update this in his 1999 version with an added section on Coastal Combat. However, aside from its historical perspective, this work fails to instruct or enlighten."
4,Very Interesting,"This is a great book to have on a table to spark some conversation. It has amazing pictures and stories. There are a few errors I noticed, two so far, in which the author refers to something he says he previously said, but which isn't there, and another odd error. I'll be more specific later. I rated it four stars because of those errors."
3,Find the heart of the story?,"I am a fan of scientific non fiction. Disappearing Spoon is one of the best books I have read in years. I read the blurb on this book and thought that perhaps it would be full of interesting anecdotes that would keep my attention on the train ride.It did not, however.Yes, there are dozens, probably hundreds if not thousands of stories in this book. NOTHING was filtered out. And yet, something tangible is missing here. None of these stories has a pull. None of them really has a human element to them, at all. So, it's like reading statistics without the numbers.In short, I could not get past the third chapter.If you like lots of trivia, this is for you. If you like interesting stories that have irony and twists as well as good trivia, well, I've not found a weather book that will suit. This one doesn't.(*)>"
2,Needs an editor!,"Interesting subject matter -- TERRIBLE writing! Doesn't his guy know someone in the English Department? I can't believe a publisher let this through with all the spelling and grammatical errors. Plus, some of the writing is downrigh turgid (that's a word the author will no doubt have to look up)."
5,More Devo greatest tunes than you can handle.,"Play this record real loud on a good clean stereo! ""Duty Now..."" shows the earlier Devo with wild excitement of guitar, synth, and robot drumming in ""Wiggly World"" and ""Strange Pursuit"" and ""Smart Patrol"". So cool.Devo changed their sound a lot between 1979 and 1981, and these two albums represent those two years. ""Freedom of Choice"" with ""Whip it!"" came in between. These are the three best Devo albums. Of course, the 1987 debut album is great too. You can't go wrong until 1982 when things got shakey. On the devo newsgroups any discussion of favorite songs yields mention of every song, it's just like that. They are the greatest!So, New Traditionalists shows a lot more synth power in place of guitar. More dance-oriented. You can play New Traditionalists over and over and over and over all in a row. ""Love Without Anger"" is fun and spastic. So hip!"
3,set tool for body trap,"Handles need to be longer. Another six inches on the handles would increase leverage and make the traps much, much easier to set."
1,Just use a piece of rope,"Too small and cheaply made to do the job right.Tie a loop on both ends of a piece of rope. Use non-tightening knots. Put one loop over the end of your booted foot. Run the other end through both eyes of the spring, and then go around and go through both again. Pull on the other loop and the spring will be easily tightened. Good practice in case you get your hand caught in a trap, this method can be done one-handed in an emergency.Google or youtube for examples."
3,"Ugly, Oily and Dirty.","This tool arrived dripping oil and covered with dust/dirt. It is two pieces of 3/4 x 1/2 inch #2 mill edge bar stock, about 20 inched long with an angled notch cut into them near one end, drilled and bolted together about 1/3rd of the length from the notched end.The bolt needed to be tightened before I could use the set tool to set a trap, but it does exactly what it is supposed to do and it works okay on my Conibear 330.Using the set tool works much better than setting the trap using a rope, and it is very difficult to open a Conibear trap with a rope if you have caught something in it. If you are unable to make one of these tools for yourself I recommend buying this one."
3,set tool for 220/ 330 body trap,too short for 330 body traps. They need to be about 6 inches longer to get the required leverage to work properly.
5,Simple to the point and works great,The setting tool is easy to use and affective. A must have for your traps especially at this price you can't beat it.
1,go,"I was expecting alot more. It was one of those movies where there's so much hype about it that you expect it to be great, but you're left waiting for the greatness to happen.. The only funny part was Sarah Polley's character limping to her car at the end."
3,Ok,I bought this for Wm Fichtner but he's not in it that much. The parts he is in are priceless but I recommend just renting it if you are watching it for him.The rest of the movie is alternately sad and funny and weird. Not too bad... but I'll be selling it on ebay.
4,What a Comedic Turn!,"I think this Film has some great underlying stories and back images. Very funny and very witty, not only are the actors good as well as the storyline. If you haven't seen this and would like to see a very funny look at the life of some average/not so average people watch this. I guarantee you will be grabbing your sides in laughter!"
3,"It was good, but not great","I saw this movie because I heard such great things about it from my friends. I liked the story and everything, but its definately not worth a lot of stars... Its fun to watch, but unless you're obsessed with raves, drugs and prostitutes, its not worth obsessing over."
4,Wonderful original movie.,"""Go"", I think is one of the better movies I've seen this year. By the use of splitting the story into three different points of view it setsit apart from all the other cliche plots of the Hollywood movies. The almost childlike distorted filming, in some scenes, gives a good perspective of some- one who is tripping on drugs and is looking out at the dizzying world through their eyes, so you can almost experience it yourself. I would recommend this to anyone dying for something more original than those 200 million blockbusters."
5,Not A Teen Movie,"First thing I want to say is that THIS IS NOT A TEEN MOVIE. These are young adults doing young adult things-going to raves, experiencing the joys and not so many joys of being an adult. Definitely a slacker movie, and it has really no redeeming characters or morals, which is fun. The only things to learn is not to take too many Ecstacy pills and what not to do in the Champagne Room at a strip club (oh, and don't eat the shrimp at a buffet).It's more the ride than the destination. I've tried to set my DVD player to shuffle to see if it will work, but this movie already so crazy you won't need it.Take a Magic Carpet ride and GO!"
5,"""Go"" is a must for any movie enthusiast","This movie has everything you're looking for in a good action/drama movie. Sex, drugs, gunfights, and a lot of laughs. If you have ever seen or heard about the movie ""Magnolia"", you will realize that the theme is somewhat the same. The way the movie is aligned, it shows that everyone's lives are interrelated, and for one crazy night, this movie shows you how. This movie takes you everywhere from the everyday supermarket to underground rave parties, casinos, to stripclubs. I highly suggest that if this sounds remotely interesting to you, at least rent it."
4,"Ignore all the ""Pulp Fiction"" comparisons","This film is not ""Pulp Fiction"", so stop saying it sucks just cause the multi-person perspective is used. Sure it borrows many ideas and styles from it, but it's not the first nor will it be the last. I've seen many films that look like an Alfred Hitchcock film, I've seen many that look like a David Lean film, I've seen many that look like a Quentin Tarrantino film. When a fresh looking film such as ""Pulp Fiction"" hits the scene, it is inevitable that knock-offs will follow. So see ""Go"" and judge for yourself. Regardless, it's great fun."
4,A wild ride,"If you're looking for one of those movies that just grabs you in and never lets go, using shameless entertainment and audacious humour to hold your interest, then ""Go"" is the utlimate ride. It's sort of like ""Pulp Fiction"" minus the extreme violence, and unfortunately, minus the hard impact. The film's intertwining stories are still cleverly laid out, and there are tiny gags that you will catch if you watch it more than once. The whole thing is created with such energy, and is loaded with trippy moments, including a look into a guy's drug-induced hallucination in a supermarket. It's pretty difficult to predict what's going to happen next, even if the events are a bit implausible, although the film does start to lost momentum towards the end. The entire array of actors deliver excellent performances, especially Sarah Polley, who is totally under-rated. ""Go"" may not be a perfect film, but it's still a lot of fun to watch."
3,Go for it,This was a pretty good film about a group of kids who get seriously involved inside the drug ring and the only bad thing is really that there was a sex scene that was pretty graphic. It was extremely funny.
3,"Listed as 2 discs, but it is only 1","This movie, listed as having 2 discs, does not. As far as the movie goes, it's not bad. It gets pretty suspenseful, which makes it pretty fun."
3,"Good, Solid Crime/Drug Comedy","I rented this film not expecting much, but to my surprise I really enjoyed it. It has some pretty funny moments, and I enjoy it's semi-dark-ish humour. Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf play two gay lovers, which sort of threw me off guard, and Taye Diggs plays a great role as well. I reccomend this film to anyone who enjoys such films as, 'Snatch', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Spun', and what not. It is a story that takes place in 24 hrs. and switches between three diff. character groups. Great directorial work, and decent acting. Could of been a little better, but it was good overall."
5,This movie was very entertaining... Pulp Fictionesque...,"Drugs... Three ways... Guns... Gays... Car chases... Very funny... Intriguing... After the first fifteen minutes, you're hooked..."
5,brilliant!,lives up to tarentino's genre. absolutely worth seeing over and over again. just pure brilliance.
3,"Entertaining, but lacking...","This is a very entertaining and stylish film with terrific performances from just about everyone involved. But it is ultimately let down by the rather gutless conclusions to some of its plotlines. The otherwise excellent conflict between Jay Mohr, Scott Wolf and the kinky cop -- is resolved with a joke. The gritty Las Vegas sequence is resolved at the end -- through broad comedy. And ultimately, there is little or no consequence depicted for illegal activity, overdosing on drugs, -- even being hit by a car and left for dead is shrugged off in this film. You are likely to enjoy this, just don't think about it too hard -- and don't bother to get it on DVD. This is the kind of movie for which God created Cinemax."
3,plastic morality,"Not to *** about the sagging moral character of Hollywood, but the last third of this film destroys the otherwise satisfying pace, character, and construction of what comes before it--it's a tricky business to ride the absurd and dark line between farce and violence and the director stumbles more than he stands. There are certainly memorable scenes and the film warrents a viewing, but to claim it's the best film of 1998 offers a sad testimony to the state of modern cinema."
4,ITS A MIATA!!!!!!!,"Go is a movie by the same people that brought you Swingers. The movie is divided into several sections, each dealing with some of the characters. I've seen this movie several times, and its witty dialogue and sadistic humor simply demanded that I buy it."
3,"Fast moving noir, but no ""Fiction""","Drug users, drug dealers, a pair of soap opera actors, and more. They all cross paths on one Christmas Eve in L.A. and Las Vegas in this film from Doug Liman, who directed Swingers. This movie certainly has lots of energy, and tries to push its audience into its ongoing rush. But unlike Pulp Fiction, the film to which it has often been compared, the screenplay is nowhere as original, funny, or good. Liman did a much better job with Swingers, which was funnier and more clever. Still, this is a talented young cast, and includes solid performances from Jay Mohr, William Fichtner, Katie Holmes, Taye Diggs and Desmond Askew."
5,Go Get It!,"An entertaining and darkly humorous movie based on 3 sub plots all cleverly intertwined. The movie starts off in a supermarket and spirals into three separate stories, from three sequences initiating in the supermarket, and taking place on one night around Christmas time. My favorite story was the one with Adam and Zack and particularly their invitation to ""Christmas dinner"". Jay Mohr was excellent as usual but Scott Wolfe was a surprise and it was good to see him doing something different. The movie was a little slow to begin with but by the time it gets to Simon's story the pace picks up and carries on at great speed. The soundtrack was a good accompaniment and to me fitted the mood of the movie. I do wish it had had wider theatrical release (like in my country) as I would have enjoyed seeing it in the cinema. Good flick!"
4,GOOOO!,"I really enjoyed this movie, but its another one that can be played out if you watch it too much. So dont. But watch it when you have your friends over or you need an action/comedy/drama/brief nudity type film. Its good, its funny, the actress who plays Ronna is gorgeous, plus Nathan Bexton is in there, hes the guy who plays Manny. He was in ""Nowhere"" which is a film to buy if any of you liked Go. they split this film up into sections, not quite like Pulp fiction but its not one continuous story. You get to see all the angles in this movie which is nice for a change. Instead of watching Pulp Fiction and trying to guess whats in the freakin' suitcase."
3,Funny story.,"This is a cleverly told tale with some innovate point of view techniques usually seen in movies like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The characters are good looking and well cast.You'll find yourself laughing to yourself often, and out loud just a few times. Wolf is great as is Jay Mohr. The female characters shine.The pacing is often frenetic and the sound and picture quality do not disappoint. You will enjoy this movie if you overlook the sometimes heavily predictable personas like the tragically hip young white poseurs. Pretty good overall.Awesome soundtrack too. Nice to see young actors in more viable roles."
3,Go,"A good film that does not leave you with a Pulp Fiction rip-off feeling. Highly creative storyline, but I give it three stars because the film will only relate to young people. If you're over ""30 something"" I wouldn't recommend the film unless you are an avid film fan."
4,A REAL TWISTER!,"Take the ride with this film -- you won't be disappointed. The whole story is told from the points of view of each of the main characters, and it is so well done that it makes you realize how perception is such a subjective thing. You will appreciate the young talent here (much better performances than in some of their t.v. shows) and the soundtrack rocks too!"
4,Go!GO!GO!!!,"It's awesome, it's like an alternative funny movie. All the plots are entertaining and interesting. Since the movie is about useless people, it's makes sense I'd like it. There's only a few annoying parts. Can easily be watched over and over again."
5,I love this movie,"Go is one of the best movies that I saw in 1999 and is one of my all-time favorites. The plot is like Pulp Fiction in that all three of the stories told intertwine to form a hell of a movie. One of the stories revolves around ecstasy deal one around a trip to Las Vegas and the last revolves around two gay soap opera stars. Full of action and laughs, Go keeps you interested for the entire length of the movie(only 103 minutes). There is some nudity and drug abuse so I wouldn't recommend this movie for those who are easily offended. But for people who like dark comedies and action and for those who love to laugh I would definitely recommend Go, which I recommended to all of my friends and would not quit talking about it until they saw it."
5,This is the DVD I keep watching over and over again,I highly recommend this movie. The story and the soundtrack are very good. The extra features on the DVD are second only to The Matrix. Very original.
3,The BR is just so-so,"The quality of the video on this Blu-Ray is only so-so, just barely an upgrade from what would be an up-converted regular DVD. The image doesn't gain anything much, and in fact I believe it's just a straight up up-converted transfer from the DVD. It's not even that clear. Side-by-side, I bet you would find it hard to distinguish this BR from the upconverted-DVD image. Other than that, the disc has pretty much everything you've all seen in the DVD special editions. I think that this BR release is lazy, where the special features look as bad as they did on the regular DVD - I was hoping for a much better quality of the Music Videos than the straight up-conversion copy from the DVD. They slapped together what was already on the special edition DVD and compiled it onto this one BR. Very lazy indeed. They could've given it some improvement treatment to the whole thing."
4,Lives Up to the Hype and to its Potential,"With so many stars in one little movie ""Go"" could have gone bust by trying to support so many characters through out the many plots in this movie. Yes it had a ""Pulp Fiction"" feel to it and yes it brought back memories of ""Swingers"". But with a great new feel added to both concepts. This movie had everything todays hyper active audiences needed: Fast paced action mixed with great story lines and a great sound track to boot. The only thing that this movie lacked was a superb ending to it all. The ending kind of fell short. While the rest of the movie kicked and rocked. More than making up for the end. If you have a little extra cash, buy this movie NOW. If not, ""Go"" rent it. It's worth the money."
4,Good Fun...,...with a plot that I could see happening to people like you and me. Time-overlapping like Pulp Fiction but without the violence. VERY FUNNY!!
2,Not that good.,"Go wasn't a very good movie at all. While not completely poor or terrible, it just wasn't that interesting or engaging. I still hadn't figured out the plot after an hour about. The plot (if there really was one) was not coherent. The acting was okay in this film, but Go just wasn't that good. Try something else."
3,Somewhat Predictable...,"I think I have seen this movie before, it was called ""PULP FICTION"". The plot was extremely predictable, they must have had to ""dumb it down"" so that slacking 20-somethings could follow the plot or something. On the positive side the movie was VERY funny, it really had some great quirky moments. Also it won some points for it's true to life nature (I can say that, having been part of the crowd that started the whole alternative/gen-x culture about 10 years back) this is definitely a case of art imitating life I suppose. All and all it was an entertaining movie, not a bad little flick. If it were not such a blatant Pulp Fiction rip off, I would have given it 4 stars. I really wanted to give it 3-1/2 but there is no option, so I have to settle for 3."
1,Can it get any worse,"I loved Swingers, and so, I was hoping for another great film with GO, but unfortunatly, all I got was that ugly kid from Dawson's Creek playing the same character from Dawson's Creek !"
1,Skip it,"This cinematic experience was quite horrid. This was quote masterpiece unquote got off to a sluggish start, and took the viewer through myriad of unpleasant imagery and monotonous story plot or lack thereof. The story-line seemed to go nowhere despite the fact that ""some people"" think this was the point, it was merely a ludicrous show of pretentious poppycock and balderdash. The acting was unseasoned and vapid. Every time Katie Holmes delivers a line the movie screeches painful halt. Mr. Tartentino probably was infuriated by the blatant plagiarism of his magnum opus, Pulp Fiction. In addition, Irvine Welsh the writer of Trainspotting, and Danny Boyle the director, may also have been offended by Go's counterfeiting of their brilliant film. Go was merely an artificial and annoying waste of time. Such videos should be avoided, and quite possibly burned in a large pile. The film was possibly as unpleasant as its soundtrack."
1,How does this movie stink? Let me count the ways.,"Amazon needs a rating of a negative number of stars for movies like this. There's absolutely NO plot, and therefore there is NO point. Ask any of the reviewers who liked the movie what the point of it was. They can't tell you, because it didn't have one.Since I had to give it one star as a minimum, I have to justify that star, so I'll say there was one good song on the soundtrack."
1,ALMOST AS BAD AS 200 CIGGARETTES,This movie is just like 200 ciggarettes but not as bad. This movie is about drugs and really nothing I cant believe I sat through the whole movie because it was really dumb and made no sense I cant believe Katie holmes would star in such a movie. Im sorry but I watch movies that make sense not try to make sense which I dont think this movie was even trying to do. The thing I dont get is couldnt they spend money on a movie that at least has a plot to it?
2,This movie blows!,I did not like this movie at all. The cover said this was a dark comedy but I did not laugh at anything. There was a scene where a guy got laid by two chicks and there was a cool car chase but not much else. It repeats the story 3 times and that was so annoying to me. I give this movie 2 stars because I was at least entertained enough to watch the whole thing and the soundtrack was awesome.
2,PULP FICTION FORMAT DUPLICATED! WARNING! WARNING!,"This movie tries to capture the beat and pulse of the late nineties ""generation"" of teens and twenty somethings. I am a proud member of the generation X and maybe I'm either ""too old"" or just didn't get it. This film represents and exaggerates the styles and mentality levels of today's youth. And let me tell you, they are a disgrace! This film has characters that are drug addicts, jaded!, pretentious, phony (one white character thinks he's black...pathetic!).I did not like the style to this film either. All the boys in this film need to WASH THE HAIR GEL OUT OF THEIR HAIR, AND TRY COMBING IT. That spiky looking ninties hair is so blah I want to throw up! I can't wait until the next fashion trends get here. This movie epitomizes everything that is going wrong in America today. Columbine ring a bell? And not to mention this is a total rip off of the premise of Pulp Fiction. Get your own ideas Doug Liman!"
2,Not at all what I expected,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I asumed that the story line was going to be based around a rave scene and when I actually saw the movie, it reminded me of Pulp Fiction (style wise). I found the story line lame as ... and in reality they focused on the rave for approximately 2 minutes of the movie which disappointed me, because that part of the trailer was what got me interested to even watch the movie in the first place. I personaly would NOT recomend this movie to anyone."
5,GO pleasantly surprised me!,"Go is very much like ""pulp fiction"",but in a good way.It is very fast-paced and i have always loved movies that go with different people's point of views and this movie did a brilliant job doing just that.I especially liked scott wolf and jay mohr's characters (even though personally i liked the second story the best)But every story was a treat to watch and i absolutely love the way that they all connect towards the end.Some people refer to this as a black comedy but to me this is just a plain comedy.And if you like this movie i recommend ""swingers""(by the same director).Either way there is no way you can be disappointed by this movie.(and as an extra treat,on dvd,you can see it in wide screen or full screen and it also includes 14 extra scenes.)"
2,"Good attempt at directing, bad attempt at story telling.","I can't figure this film out; it is shot in an interesting manner, showing the same period of time through the eyes of its three main characters, the only problem I really have with this film is how it poor the character development is. The characters, are shallow, predictable people. Whether its the amotivational drug-dealer, or the prissy homosexual played by Jay Mohr. I found these stereotypes to draw greatly from the movie and make the ending dull and cheesy."
2,Swingers,"My mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner and I settled down to watch this on the couch the other night. The cover proudly announces 'from the makers of 'Swingers'. ""Now, I'm the king of the slackers, ohh, the LA V.I.P. I made some slop and had to stop and that's what's bothering me. I wanna be like Tarantino, and stroll right into town. Leach like all the others, I'm tired of hanging around. Oh, Quenty-poohs. I wanna be like you-hoo-hoo. I wanna walk like you, talk like you, boo-hoo-hoo. You see it's true-hoo-hoo. A clown like me-hee-hee. Can learn to be, just like you, man, too-hoo-hoo.""Half way through the video my mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner turned to me and said: ""Sarah Polley doesn't half give me the horn."" Terrifying words when you've once again forgotten to put on the wind-cheater and galoshes."
3,Go - DVD plus Music Videos,"I did not like the movie because it contained unecesary vulgarity, profanity, and nudity. It did not add anything to the movie. However it was not the worst movie in human history it just had alot of stuff that it didn't need. I bought the DVD for the music videos, so I guess I'm predesposed to not be the biggest fan of the movie anyway. The movie is available in full screen and widescreen (its the same disc, you get to choose in the DVD menu) The music videos are:""New"" by No Doubt""Magic Carpet Ride"" by Philip Steir, featuring Steppenwolf""Steal My Sunshine"" by LEN"
1,Hang-yourself-BAD,"THIS IS ONE OF, IF NOT THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER WASTED MY MONEY TO SEE.THE PLOT WAS TOTALY UNREALISTIC AND THE CHATACTERS WERE UNBELIEVABLY FAKE.I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS WORSE, ALL THE BOUNCING FROM SCENE, OR THE DIALOG. THIS MOVIE DEGRADES THE REPUTATION OF THE ACTORS IN IT.IT IS ALSO NOTHING LIKE ANY OF THE PREVIEWS I'VE SEEN FOR IT. AT FIRST I THOUGHT MABEY I JUST WASN'T THE AUDIENCE FOR THIS MOVIE, BUT THEN I HAD OTHER PEOPLE TELLING ME HOW INCREADIBLY BAD IT WAS. IF YOU WANT TO BE BORED TO DEATH, THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU.I HOWEVER WOULDN'T WATCH IT AGAIN IF I WAS PAID TO."
1,Morally bankrupt -- a shame really,"At the risk of sounding like a 50's censor, I'd have cut out about 5 minutes of the most in-one's-face sexploits and other dross to arrive at a movie that could have retained its humor. As released, there wasn't much room to take away much of a theme, other than go for the gusto, despite what it costs everyone around you. And yet the acting, style, and some vague hints, suggest more could have been intended. One can laugh at the absurd and yet be given pause, rather than simply being encouraged to revel in utter degeneracy."
2,VERY STRANGE FILM!,"I purchased this DVD based on the review given to the film by a professional ""reviewer"" in this country who gave it 7/10. It is the first and last time I buy a DVD based on the opinion of a third party. All in all the film and the acting were of a reasonable quality, but other than a few laughs, it did not appeal to me at all. I have a serious aversion to drug abuse and any movie which glorifies it as, in my opinion, this one did, I tend to find rather distasteful, as I did Pulp Fiction, which was a much better film."
4,Diamond in the rough,"This is one of those movies you watched because of all the B list actors that were in tv shows at the time were in it. I expected something really cheesy and boring but I love this movie it has a bit of everything Laughter, romance, stupidity, action and a lil craziness"
4,90's coming of age rave culture...,"this is a rare gem of a film- intimate, with funny moments, action, and human drama. It really captures the mood and anxiety of being a young adult in the 90's.It has 3 big things in its favor.#1: the cast. What a great cast- Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Scott Wolf, Jay Mohr, Timothy Olyphant and others have great chemistry together.#2: the script: funny, dramatic, great dialogue, and fresh. Basically, it is a story of generation Xer's (like myself) coming of age. They are trying to pay their bills, be independent, have relationships, and experience some excitement. Along they way they get into trouble while attending a rave party when everything goes wrong.#3: the soundtrack. The music fits perfectly with the film.If you are a gen Xer, this film will resonate with you emotionally."
5,One time is never enough!,"I saw GO!the first week it was out in theaters and absolutely loved it. The twists and turns keep you right there in the center of the action the whole time. This is one of those movies you can watch again and again and catch little things here and there you've missed in the past. All in all, a great comedic, action packed fun filled ride!"
3,a nice collage,"A storyline that's told from different perspectives; all plotlines follow one definitive event in the histories of the characters. The cast is filled with semi-big names: Katie Holmes, Sarah Polley, Jay Mohr, William Fletcher, Scott Wolf, but at the end, everyone's role is somewhat minuscule. The ending of the film is whimsical, if unrealistic. This movie is fluffy, at best, but is, at times, exciting to watch nonetheless."
1,Doesn't Work,I was really disappointed with these lamps. The sensors never worked right and one lamp died completely. The point of having the lamp is for the light sensor and yet it didn't even work. I have been stuck now with 2 lamps the don't work at all but they look nice. I would not recomend
4,Keeps the heat out of the kitchen,We purchased this product for our emergency power outage kit and have found that it is VERY useful without any emergency. One of its great features is that it keeps the heat out of the kitchen on those hot summer evenings when the thought of turning the stove on brings groans from every member of the family. We have used the Wok with the outdoor cooker and have obtained some of the best quality stir-fry as of yet. The griddle/grill is a very nice addition and surprisingly easy to clean. We also have a large garden and the cooker handles our canning equipment with ease. We've enjoyed the experience and would recommend it to others.
2,Not ENOUGH Brody,"I bought this tape for one reason and that's to see my all time favorite wrestler of all time Bruiser Brody. Even though the title claims to be a ""Memorial"" to Bruiser Brody. It's completely misleading as there is one two Brody matches on the tape.Though the tapes are good, there isn't enough Brody on the tape to be classified as a memorial to him. From the ad, you are given the impression that Bruiser Brody is all over the tape. He isn't!"
4,Great Compilation,"This compilation is a great starter CD for your KJ collection. It is easy to see where Trent Reznor, System of a Down and Metallica recieved some of their inspiration from. The music is a hybrid of punk and 80's alternative rock. An important segment of music history."
1,pretty bad book,"forget autobio, it was not even a decent book, bunch of unrelated chapters related to Lincoln. Don't buy this book."
3,"Good, But Way Over-Rated","This is a good Lou Reed album, but a ""masterpiece""? Uh...not at all, in my opinion. Robert Quine's guitar sounds nice. ""Waves of Fear"" is a great track. ""My House"" has some nice lyrics. ""The Day John Kennedy Died"" is well-intended, but very schmaltzy. And the rest is no better or worse than anything on ""Growing Up in Public"" - compare the two, folks. There ain't much difference. A much better album is LEGENDARY HEARTS from 1983. Lou's previous masterpiece was STREET HASSLE, prior to BLUE MASK, and he wouldn't have another until NEW YORK in 1989.BLUE MASK is just another good Lou Reed album, nothing special."
5,Lou Reed's true masterpiece of sound and words.,"I've been listening to my cassette tape version of Blue Mask for years. I've always felt a chill from the experience of the anger in the writing of the title track. The gut-wrenching guitar in Waves of Fear along with the lyrics ""I hate my own smell"" conjors up images of junkie squallor that only an experienced addict could portray. The beautiful and harmonious tribute to his then anchor, wife Sylvia brings to the recording a man who has peace in his new sobriety. A lesson for anyone struggling with past demons. I've been waiting for the CD version to arrive in the US domestic. Did I mention The Heroine? The line asked in that song ""And where's the heroine?"" is a genius throwback to his own song Heroin from the VU. Lou Reed at his genius and emotional best!"
4,Barn Yard,"This sound track has a very upbeat feel to it and is fun to listen to.When I heard Sam Elliot doing ""Stand My Ground"" I thought it was Jonny Cash. I wish he (Elliot) would do more songs.The only thing I was disapointed in was that it didn't have the Aerosmith song on it. So I'll give it 4 stars."
5,Good for introductory Spanish students.,"I found this book to be extremely helpful when I was learning Spanish on my own. It has 200 model verbs, and an index of hundreds of additional verbs that are referenced to the appropriate model verb. The format is easier to use than the popular ""501 Spanish Verbs"" book. And it has more usage examples than that book does. I especially recommend this book for self-learners and students in their first two years of high school or college spanish. I continue to use it as a convenient reference on Spanish verb conjugations."
2,Worried about accuracy,"I just started going through the book and am worried about its accuracy.I was a tad bit dismayed as on the very first page, it states that East Timor had enrolled in the ASEAN bloc. As far as I know East Timor has yet to be admitted. This appears to be an error. Likewise, I believe there were five, not four, founding members of ASEAN. The author has forgotten Thailand.This really worries me. If such basic information about SE Asia is not correct, I wonder about the rest of the book.If these are errors, I wonder how it could be in it's sixth edition without anyone catching them."
5,Awesome for around the house fixings,This is awesome to have for around the house projects that need to be done. Its all easy to use and a great gift for any homeowner or tool enthusiast.
3,appollo tools 79pc,"For just small around the house trivial jobs this is a nice little set to have. I certainly would not use a tool set like this on jobs that require more torque such as working on cars. My experience with off brand tools like this never hold up to car work like my craftsman tools will. The only major complaint about this set of tools I have is the cheap quality of these blow molded cases, but I can say that on any tool set even Craftsman uses this pathetic technology blow molded cases that warp and never close correctly or never hold the tools in place. I remember long ago when plastic tool cases were made from plastic injected molds where the case was solid and not hollow. Those cases are still in my garage today and always hold the tools in place along with clasping tightly after 20+ years. If they only would have stuck with cases like that."
4,Fine for an inexpensive tool kit,"This is a fine inexpensive tool kit, though it is difficult to extra the small pieces from the blow-molded case."
1,garbage,"extremely cheap and poorly made set. the socket wrench is awful. the directional knob comes out when twister either direction, the ratcheting screwdriver is wobbly and not worth using, and the case does not hold the allen or bit sets tightly. very disappointed in this."
2,Dollar store tools...,Not very happy with tools. Hammer is small and was bent. All tools feel like cheap Chinese metal. Good kit for a kid.
4,Overall very good,I think black site has done very well with this game. even though i put 4 stars i think this is 3.5. Graphics are well designed but the programmers should make adjustments with the weapons. Just add more because most of the time you only have a machine gun. Im not saying thats a bad thing its just the game should be a bit more challenging. If they make another patch for this game MAKE MORE WEAPONS! This game looks like its on the border line for being an T-M game. Its a bit like gears of war and halo mixed but just more scary.
2,This one has issues...,My PC has more than the minimum requirements but the game still plays very choppy. The game has bugs and crashes even after I downloaded the patch from the Blacksite website. The content of the game is mostly the same old sci-fi stuff that is already out but I like that sci-fi stuff. If it was not for the bugs I would give the game 4 stars but with all the problems I don't think the game is not worth it. The game might play better on a different platform than PC.
5,"Great price,great game,Great Amazon","Amazon makes it almost too easy to purchase things. I am 73 years old and in my second childhood.BlackSite, Area 51 is one of those ""Unable to stop Playing"" games. Graphics are terrific if your computer is fast enough andwill handle the game. Mine will and the game is great.I recommend Amazon and also recommend to game.Thanks, Larry"
3,Worth the price,"Not the best of PC Games, but worth the price. Give it a try. This comes from a die hard FPS person. I ran this on Vista and did not have any problems."
1,Crashes when trying to change screen resolution,"The game itself is a bit lame, nothing more than an average shooter with no surprises at all. But what really p***** me off is that I COUDN'T PLAY AT 1920x1080. The default res is 1280x720. When I first launched the game, I succesfully changed it to the desired 1920x1080 and started to play. After a while I closed it. When tried to play again, I noticed the resolution got back to 720p. Ok, got it set to FHD again, and when clicked on ""accept"" it crashed to desktop. 100 times I tried, 100 times it crashed. I had to swallow the default config to be able to play. Patches won't solve the issue. So WTF!If your native res is 1280x720, and the only thing you expect from a shooter is shooting, go ahead. Otherwise, don't."
1,Horrible,this game not working I recommended don't buy this disk because is not functional don't waste your time and money in that....
2,"Played for 5 minutes, then deleted","I'm not sure why I bought this game: I knew it would be bad. I guess I thought Harvey Smith made some great games, so maybe this was a rough gem. Nope! Just a boring, vanilla, limited-in-every-way-possible wack-a-mole shooter. The worst part is that the weapons have literally no kick or feedback, you might as well be using a laser pointer. Note to FPS designers: before you do ANYTHING ELSE be sure that it is fun and rewarding to aim and click the mouse button; if you fail at that, nothing else matters.This game fails at that most basic task, and thus it's not even worth discussing--too bad!"
3,not bad budget fps if you can get a deal on it,A good secondary fps but make sure you don't pay more than 7- 8 bucks fore this game its a good go between to play while waiting for the next big title
3,Average game,"An average FPS, good design but lacks depth. very linear play with not a lot of variety. Enemy AI is poor but functional, allied AI is good. Storyline is poor, as in weapon variety. At best it is a $20 game for its fun value."
1,a slick one note shooter,"its a pretty slick shooter that gives a good first impression, but theres nearly no variety in weaponry. the shotgun is useless, the plasma gun appears very late in the game, and the bazooka forces the player to use it when the developers say so. The only two weapons you found yourself using was the assualt rifle and sniper rifle. I'm the kind of person that judges a shooter based on the different weapons a game gives the players, and how these different weapons offer different tactical advantages and disadvantages(metal arms was awesome), and in this regard blacksite is epic fail, in fact the original area 51 was better in this respect. Add to this many other small issues in blacksite and it becomes a game I simply cannot recemmend."
1,horrible,"this game is not worth buying. I tried it on two different computers and graphics are horrible. One computer i tried it on had the best video graphics card dell offers and it was still horrible to try and play. voices did match the peopke talking. and the game play, well i didn't play the game more than 4 minutes into it because everytime i would shot or move or anything else would move it would start glithing up really bad. i would not recommend this game to anyone."
5,51,black site a great game...if your 19 or 20 i am 10 and have played only a bit the big cyborg alien things are creepy i shoot the legs it falls over yay its dead not it detaches from the legs and crawls to you this is a scary yet fun game if your 10 or over this is a good game for you i love it
4,Excellent!,"I think this book is an absolutely wonderful introduction to a particular subset of Buddhist philosophy, and done so in such a way that it may benefit our own lives as well as the academic and practices of psychology today.Specifically, the examination of the Buddhist Realms of existence (of which there are 6 I believe) and its relation to our states of mind. In doing so, we are treated to stories of the personal struggles of his patients as well as their parallels to Buddhist concepts (most notably the 6 realms).I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good INTRODUCTION (as the depth could be expanded further of course)to Buddhist philosophy within our current scientific concepts, as well as psychologists looking to expand their world view and see ancient Buddhists as their predecessors. A well written and caring book."
5,I loved this book!,"It was one of a few required texts for a Buddhism class. I chose it because I have an interest in psychology, particularly the psychodynamic perspective (unconscious motivation) and this book added to my life in such a way! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about Buddhism and freeing one's ""self"" from the limitations of convention. I don't agree with everything in it, but this is a book for my collection, definitely."
4,Purchase without hesitation,"I purchased this a replacement for a copy that I loaned out that, for very good reason, was never returned. Start here, read Epstein's ""Open to Desire"" afterward."
4,Parallels,"I recommend this book to anyone who has a genuine interest in both psychotherapy and Buddhism and who is seeking to apply both aspects to their life. Fear not, you need not possess a degree in psychology or in Eastern philosophy to understand the concepts Dr. Epstein conveys. He explains psychotherapy in very elementary terms as well as the insightful teachings of the Buddha. It is truly a seamless integration of Eastern and Western ideologies which leaves the reader feeling empowered and able to make sense out of two greatly misunderstood, or not fully understood, topics."
4,Good introduction to Buddhism,This book is a terrific introduction to Buddhism. It puts Buddhism into psychological framework and makes it more accessible. This book is not about avoiding pain or anything pollyana like that. It's about understanding your feelings in a way that you can actually experience them for what they are: just feelings!The the idea is to watch your feelings as they happen to you psychically and try to understand what the experience of having a feeling is actually like in a conscious engaged manner. It's about a whole lot more as well. It's complicated to describe but it couldn't be more simple once you get it. It's not New Age or feel good stuff. It's a good read if your interested in Buddhism or Relgion in general and Psychotherapy as well. Don't take my word for it though. Trust yourself.
2,Rationalizing Buddhism,I am at page 68 so far and my reaction been that this book is an attempt at rationalizing Buddhism. I think it is either an attempt to explain Buddhism to Psychologists in terms of psychology or an attempt to sell Psychology to followers of Buddhism using some parallels between Buddha's teachings and Psychology. But as I have read in some other books and as I believe myself spiritual experience cannot be rationalized; else anyone will become Buddha just by reading the well explained concepts in such books!!
4,A worthwhile read,"I found the first six chapters of this book well worth reading. Chapter seven takes a turn for the worst, however, as the author begins the challenge of comparing and contrasting buddism and psychotherapy. The book becomes confusing, tangential, and requires more effort to understand than is gained in insight. I felt the book would have benefited from further discussing how I can change the perceptions of my emotions to experience my emotions in a new way. Instead the book takes me on a rollercoster of theories and examples that further confuse me,and falsely claim the practice of transference in psychotherapy as the missing component of buddism in the Western World. None the less the first six chapters are well worth reading and inspire me to further learn about buddism (and myself, or rather, my false selves)."
4,Chocolate Mold,This chocolate mold worked well. I used it to make little chocolate candies to go into the favors for a wedding shower. I had no problems and the favors came out great!
5,Thailand's Political & Diplomatic History,Stowe's engaging book covers the political and diplomatic history of Thailand during the defining years between 1932-1945. The book clearly discusses the influence of the military elite in the abolition of absolute monarchy in Thailand as well as the international political maneuverings that took place (between Thailand and the opposing powers of Japan and the Allied nations) during WWII. The author's style of writing also manages to sustain my interest until the very end. Highly recommended.
4,AOR Is Back!!,"AOR has made quite a comeback in the last couple of years. Change of Heart has been part of this growing trend. They have two previous CD's called Change Of Heart 1998 & Continuum 2000. I hear influences of FM or FM/UK, Boston and Journey. There is noting earth shattering about this release but it is very good. There are catchy coruses, great musicianship and excellent song structures. For fans of FM, Bon Jovi, Boston & Journey."
4,Fun Series,"I Like Fern Michaels, this is classic Fern with interesting over the top situations. Just flat fun to read! I will read more of the Sisterhood Series"
4,"Not a ""nice"" book, just a fun and good one!","Unlike some of the others, I do find the anger real. Is it hard to sympathize? Yes, these women are doing vigilante justice, they are not sweet and shy, they are pissed and out for business. BUT it seems to me that there are stories like this where the vigilante is a man, and people can sympathize.This is a quick read, I didn't buy it expecting perfection, I bought it to keep me interested. I am surprised at the anger express by some of the other reviewers. `I am never going to buy another Zebra book'? Since I am not a Zane Grey fan should I give up on Dorchester?There are parts of the story where you know it just couldn't happen the way described but most novels have parts that just couldn't happen. The dialogue was weaker than I expected and the characters less developed, but I expect that is so the series has room to grow.Don't buy this book if you are excepting sweet and nice. This is not a ""nice"" story but it keeps you cheering most of the time."
1,Rank Amateur !,"Where is the Fern Michaels who wrote the great Texas, Kentucky, & Las Vegas series? ""Weekend Warriors"" is not even a good First Novel. What a disappointment! Although the revengeful plot is interesting and I somewhat agree with it, the writing is juvenile - I feel like I spun through the outline of a book which never got written - no character depth. If you're desperate for a $1 easy read (not worth any more), OK. Otherwise, forget it."
4,Very Different!!!!!,"WhenI started this book I thought what kind of book is this but I have to tell you I really enjoyed this book! It is totally different than anything Fern Michaels has ever written, but it for people who have gotten messed over by the judicial system and take matters into their own hands. I laughed in quite a few places and okay maybe it went a bit too far with the punishment issued but who of us hasn't dreamed of some way to ""get even"" with the jerks in our life. There is even a referral to Lorena Bobbit in there. I can't wait for the next one to come out and see what the group has in store for their next victim..... Its a fast read so I think most people can finish it in one day"
1,Amateurish Writing,"Needing a book to take to the beach, I picked this up in the supermarket check-out line because it sounded interesting and I'd read Fern Michaels before and enjoyed her books. This book was a real disappointment. Poor writing, unbelievable dialogue, outlandish plot and one-dimensional characters. I didn't even finish the book."
4,Good series,"This was a fun read and I quickly moved on to the next books in the series, I am currently on the 4th book and still hooked!"
5,weekend warriors,"I love those women who have fallen between the cracks of law and order, these weekend warriors, these avengers, who will leave no stone unturned to seek justice for those for whom Lady Justice has turned her head. I can just picture Myra, who is so precious and Charles who is the genious of the Sisterhood. What a motley crew and what wonders they have done. I'm reading the whole series. I want more, more, more."
4,EXCELLENT START FOR AN ENGAGING SERIES,"Page turning start for a series of guilty pleasure readings. Characters with interesting back stories keep you caring what happens to each of the ""girls"". Secondary participants are equally adept at keeping you turning pages with fairly witty dialogue (with NO GRATUITOUS SEX!! yea!!) and involving scenarios. Of course, the plots are far fetched, but who cares? This is a fun read and the continuing saga promises to be equally entertaining."
3,Fun but Unrealistic,"I love the premise and the story is fun to read, but if you're looking for realistic, this isn't your cup of tea. The first scenes are gripping and engaging, but the dialogue seems to run on a bit. Once I let go of the idea that it could possibly be realistic, I enjoyed the characters and the overall premise."
1,stretches credibility,this fern michaels is like no other i've read. it's way over the top and stretches credibility to a new level
2,Disapointed,"Reader from Naples, FLI will not continue with this series. Stories are too far fetched."
1,chick-lit,"This book is so bad I would have given it no stars if I could. The content could have been written by a high school student. It was recommended to me by a member of my book club. Because of this, I ignored all the other bad reviews and bought it anyway. I should have listened to the reviewers! It is the first of a series. I can't think of anything more painful than continuing with the rest of these books."
4,weekend warriors,I have read this first of her sisterhood books and found it funny and entertaining. I think it is dlightfully different of Fern to write about some of lifes injustices and how these ladies chose to deal with them. I am waiting for the next sequel with great anticipation. Thanks Fern for not just writing romantic tripe. I get so tired of reading she loves him and he loves her but they cant stand each other for the whole book until the last chapter they fall passionately in bed and love.
3,I'm not sure what to say.,"I could not relate to any of the characters. The characters were empty and the story was just not well put together. I much prefer to feel something for at least one character. I'm quite disappointed. I've read other Fern Michaels books and liked them. To me, she just dropped the ball (no pun intended) on this one. Very anticlimactic!"
3,I May Continue,"I May continue the series but one book at a time. The sisterhood seemed to suddenly formed, it doesn't work for me that the book started and it was suddenly 16 months later then another 8 months later"
5,Excellent snapshots on how to improve your habits!,"Mitch Thrower has put together an excellent collection of time-saving and attention refocusing examples and lessons. As I read this book, I could easily see the logic and value in his lessons and examples.I have found that I can read one chapter and then focus my attention on its subject for several days, working to hone and improve my efforts in that area alone. This book can really help you to get better control of your valuable time- and due to that, it will stay on the top of my desk as a reference tool.Overall, there is much to learn in this book and I highly recommend it."
5,Wonderful Tool for Success,"This book is a wonderful tool for success. Mitch walks the reader through a huge variety of different work place problems or errors and helps you to understand how to solve them in order to be more efficient and successful in the workplace. The thing I loved about this book was the way it was written. Each problem/issue is its own chapter and each chapter is only about a page long. This makes it easy to read, and it keeps your attention. It also makes it easy to put down and come back to. I would recommend this book to anyone- even if they are already a successful business person."
5,Amazing Book!,This really is a MUST READ. I'm generally not a fan of self-help books because I find learning things for myself the way to go. Not with this book though -- I read it in one sitting and was constantly jotting down notes and ideas that I've been implementing when running my company.I couldn't recommend this book more!!
4,Matt Skiba finds his inner Morrissey.,"This cd is not for those who stopped listening to Alkaline Trio after ""Maybe I'll Catch Fire"" because they ""sold out"" by writing more polished songs. It's catchy as hell even though most of the songs are mid-tempo. There are big sing-a-long choruses and a few more agressive fist-pumpers that wouldn't feel out of place on ""Good Morning"" or ""Crimson"". Expect Skiba signature clever gothic-tinged lyrics. You'll be singing on the first listen. Keyboards give the slower songs a dream-like quality.The only reason ""Patent Pending"" isn't getting 5 out of 5 stars is because the lyrics and music are so simple. Some of the songs feel a little too repetitive, but this album has really grown on me. It's worth the money. Also, seeing Heavens live is an experience not to be missed!"
3,Decent release from Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba.,"This album was exactly what I expected, which is why I gave it three stars. It didn't blow me away but it didn't disappoint me. I would still recommend it to fans of Alkaline Trio."
2,Long Live The Trio!,"The whole is greater than the sum;how often that rings true is unknown,but here is a strong example. While Skiba stays true to form with his dark and macabre lyrics,this effort comes up short.The full and powerful sound that is generated by The Alkaline Trio is clearly missing here.The title track is excellent,but the balance of the album is thin and stale,and there is much to be said for the way that Skiba and his vocal partner in the Trio,Daniel Andriano complement each other perfectly.All in all,this is one reason that what may be the greatest band most people have never heard of are best united."
3,If you like Alkaline Trio.....,"....then you will like this. I isn't terrible, but it's not great either. It's just one of those records you listen to and think, ""Hey, that guy from that other band did this thing too. Neato."" Matt Skiba's vocals are not anything out of the norm on this album. Every single line is sung exactly as you would expect. Some of the songs offer up chord progressions and key changes that make it stand out apart from Alkaline Trio, but in the end - this just sounds to me like Alkaline Trio doing bad Depeche Mode covers. Again, it's not terrible. It's worth owning or having a friend make a copy for you."
3,Bizarre stories,"Be warned that one of the stories in this book is about the rape of a young girl. Not a good bedtime story or any childrens story for that matter.Many of these stories are bizarre in content and really make little sense overall. I wonder how much they have strayed from the original story told by oral tradition. They are nice and short and perfect for bedtime stories when you don't want to commit to a long book. Seriously though, be prepared for some off-the-wall material, violence and gore."
3,Adequate,"Adequate is really the best way to describe these towels. They work, but if you are expecting to get the red ""cloth"" shop towels you are use too, these are not those. The towels themselves, are basically just strong paper towels that dispense from a box. In those regards if that's all you are looking for they are great, but if you are expecting cloth, look elsewhere. So, Why the three stars? They do work and serve the purpose intended, but I reserve 5 star ratings for great products, this as I say is adequate, or average, so 3 stars.Remember, Red Shop Towels these are not, Red Paper Towels they are."
4,A nifty and addictive little number,"I first heard Baby Fox in an Ice Cream Store and my first question to the server was "" Which Portisehead album is that?"". Baby fox is like the dub induced love child of The Selector, Portisehead and R.L. Burnside. Heavy old school Ska, Oddly Dark and Trip Hoppy and a Slide and Drone Blues quality that all blend together to make something quite cool.This is easily the type of CD you can put on and play all day long. Very addictive and ambient but much much more than background tunes. While it is not on my desert island list, it is indeed in heavy rotation in my play lists."
4,The work of a future master,"This book is well worth the time, even if much for reasons other than the story itself. To begin with, the story itself is good - not great, but good. On the other hand, if you have read much Nabokov, reading this is like watching an infant Beethoven preparing to play his first recital as a student - you can see the promising beginnings and sudden flights of trills and mental flexibility which provide clues to the degree of mastery which will follow. The book itself is good, the story and the characters are touching and well realized, but the true precious value of this book is in noting how and where you can still see the strings attached to the puppets."
3,shadow of the greatness to come,"This novel is a good first effort, with vivid characters and a bìt of a surprise ending, which is one of Nab's trademarks. While I would never have read it for itself alone, it is interesting to see how a genius began in a new medium."
2,"Great style, dearth of story","Stylistically enchanting and emotionally true, the novel is just too moribund, stuck in its banal location and flat characters. The ending's final twist isn't totally unexpected, but is presented in a way that is both unusual and real. Yet the book's short length is still too far to go for its brief, lightning bug burst of insight at the finale."
2,It works sometime!,I haven't had much luck with this sensor.May be it works fine in drywall only. My house has old-fashioned drywall that is half layer plaster and half layer cement. It did work once in a while. I followed the instructions though!.
2,Do not buy this one,"Do not buy this oneunless you want to pay $5.00 for the colour!! Buy the blue one from Amazon instead. They are IDENTICAL but with different prices and colour. The yellow one is $15.44 and the other is $9.99!I am sure there could be copyright issues but don't even go there. Do NOT buy the ""Pack of three"" as suggested by Amazon. Buy two blues ones if you want two subamarines.By the way, neither are much good actually, unless you have a bath that is 20 feet long!!"
4,Rise to Literary Greatness,"When I opened Jeff Shaara's Rise to Rebellion, I opened the door of a time machine, and was promptly ushered into the pre-Revolution time period. While Shaara's work remains technically historical fiction, he nails the time period, and most of the founding Fathers. Why couldn't my history teacher have given me this book and its companion, the Glorious Cause? You can learn a lot of history in an entertaining fashion from Professor Shaara. He just keeps getting better, and every history buff should have his work."
5,Easy to forget it's fiction,"This book is a great read for anyone interested in American history. Jeff Shaara really brings the colonial times to life and explores the reasons, whether American or British, that the Revolutionary War HAD to happen. He does, at times, spend a lot of time in his character's heads letting you watch as they painstaikenly think through every anvenue of a problem. But I found that this approach drew me into the situation and helped me to understand it better. This book is would be a great starting place for anyone interested in this part of our country's great history. It gives you a way to look on the past that is more interesting than a history book. And while it's not 100% true (it is fiction, after all), it gives you insight into situations in ways that history books cannot."
5,"Emotional, educational, and entertaining!","Jeff Shaara, like his father, has a tremendous gift for both presenting history as it was while giving us a look into what real historical personages might have thought and felt at pivotal moments in American history. His portrait of Benjamin Franklin is particularly engaging. The reader will feel a part of the action 200 years into the past with this fabulous novel of the American Revolution."
5,Informative and Fun,"This fine book, which starts with the 1770 Boston Massacre, describes the flow of political and military events-both in the American colonies and in England-that culminates in the Declaration of Independence. It's fascinating reading and shows how a strong dislike of British policies and British high-handedness gradually morphs into military, and then formal political, opposition. Shaara conveys these events by imagining the individual experiences of a few key players-John Adams, Ben Franklin, General Thomas Gage, and so on-in this 1770 to 1776 time period, thereby communicating both an American and British perspective on events. This is a good read, particularly in its description of the Battle of Breed's Hill. Still, Shaara's odd tendency to write in very choppy sentences (no conjunctions) when describing his characters in the mundane matters of everyday life is annoying."
4,Good historical fiction,"A good, quick paced read covering the events that led the American colonies to sign the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, 1776. All the major events are covered, The Stamp Act, The Boston Massacre, The Continental Congress etc. in a way that gives you a more personal ""you are there"" feel of events that you were most likely simply required to memorize in high school. Highly recommended reading."
3,slow going but entertaining,"RISE TO REBELLION is a version of events leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence...GLORIOUS CAUSE, the second volume, finishes the Revolution. Shaara's closest relative as a writer is WEB Griffin, Shaara uses the same cinematic crosscutting style and gives his his characters about as much depth. All of the real life figures who populate this book (John & Sam Adams, Franklin, Washington, etc ), despite A LOT of ruminating, basically only exist in the context of aiding the revolution...John & Abigail Adams get a few scenes together, but the women don't have much to do other than that. Still, the narrative moves just fast enough to hold your attention, although this book could have been considerably shorter,"
5,"Excellent, Shaara is back to form",I have just finished Rise to Rebellion and loved it. As a history major in college I have been forced to read a great nember of textbooks on the subject ( a good one is THE GLORIOUS CAUSE by Robert Middlekauff )and found this help put events in order and clarify the many facets of this most momentus event in our nation's history.I did not like Gone for Soldiers. The flow was bad and I got tired of the same three characters getting all the ink. What I love about both Jeff Shaara and his father are the way that they let you inside the key characters and see what they are thinking.One of the previous reviews complained that this is formula writing. If it is I love it. I can't wait for the next book and I hope that Jeff continues to write great historical fiction for years to come.
3,Gets better as it goes along ...,"It took quite a while for me to get into this book, solely because of the author's penchant for playing out so much of the action inside the heads of the characters involved. And since the lead up to Revolution involved principle characters who were separated and working their ways toward one another, there wasn't a lot of external interactions. That drove me absolutely BUGGY! But once their paths started to merge in Philadelphia, it became a much more easily read book, and when they reached the point of approving the Declaration, I was in tears of joy and pride at the way it was presented. Novelized? Yes. But well presented by the end."
5,Excellent!!,"This is an absolutely wonderful book about the incredible beginnings of America. Told from the point of view of Ben Franklin, John Adams, and other famous names in history, the story instantly draws the reader's attention in and holds it tight. This is one of the best historical novels I have ever read. I can't wait to read the next one in the series!"
5,Engaging,"Very interesting. Keeps your attention, and is a quick read. Accurate in the events and made readable for those that may not be so familiar with history and think is boring."
2,Not Pleased,"I have read Jeff Shaara's other war stories and hoped that this book would be just as exciting. However, I found the book slow in comparison to his others and was not pulled in enough to even finish."
3,Interesting read,"This work is very interesting. Although I prefer more romance (eg Defenders of the Holy Grail) mixed in with my history, and I like the way Agori blends his facts with themes, Shaara has done well with this subject. I also recommend ""Defenderds""!"
2,Book to Read once,"this book is a great book if u really luv histroy. In my opinion, it gets a bit confusing with all the excerpts, but gives a good idea of the american revolution."
1,Hated it!,"Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say ""Bad! Bad author!""This is one of those books.Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to ""hip up"" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much."
4,A great way to learn about our history,"For people who may find history ""boring"". This is a great way to learn about our Revolution in the form of a great novel! Do not mistake this for a history lesson. You will be stuck on this book from the first page!"
3,Easy Summer History Reading,"This is a good refresher read for those who have forgotten their history of the American Revolution and a good introduction for those who never learned. It's easy reading covering the period between 1770 - 1776. But Shaara certainly isn't the first writer to cover this period in a historical novel. For those who want to read more, go the the library and read Kenneth Roberts' great American Revolution novels; Arundel, Rabble in Arms and Oliver Wiswell."
5,The best book I've read to date.,"This book was recommended to me by my son. I read it and absolutely could not put it down. This is not the history I learned in school many years ago. Jeff makes it seem like you know all our founders personally and get to interact with them. You know that it's a novel, but you can't help feeling that this is the way it really happened. I highly recommend it if you're at all interested in the start of our country."
5,A Great Way to Brush Up on your History,"On the basis of this one book, I bought every other work by Shaara (father and son). I do not regret my decision.I am familiar with U.S. history, but college was a long time ago. I had forgotten what an interesting person Franklin was, how intimidating Washington could be, how important Adams was.Perhaps this is the ideal book for a teenager who refuses to read his textbooks. I would also nominate this (and the series) for those of us who just need to be reminded.I would suggest you read each set of books (the Revolution, the Civil War) in sequence."
4,Rise to Rebellion - A review,"In ""Rise to Rebellion"", Jeff Shaara takes his successful style from the Civil War venue to the era of the Revolutionary War. Written in a style which is more like a novel, we get to understand the persons and personalities which shaped this vital part of our nation's history. I would recommend it to any reader, particularly those who consider themselves to be students of history. As with the works of both he and his father, Shaara leaves the reader feeling that they are right on the battlefield or among the those writing the Declaration of Independence."
3,A Decent Read,"""Rise to Rebellion"" had an extremely promising start. It began as an exctiing novel and I couldn't put it down. Its characters were very interesting and breathed life into American legends. My only problem with this novel was that it took too long to get going. Shaara's ""Gods and Generals"" took a short time to develop the story and really start up what we're there to read. ""Rise to Rebellion"" started to bore me as I got into the middle. To me it seemed as if I was reading the same thing over and over and over again. And just as I thought the Revolution had truly begun, Shaara makes it seem as if Breed's Hill can be excused and there is still a possibility of no war with England. I was tired when I finally turned that last page. Hopefully ""The Glorious Cause"" will be more about the war than the politics, because I've had more than enough of the latter."
4,History,"The Mexican War is not the most recognized part of American history atleast in the New England area. I thought the story was good but would have pefered that the characters were developed more in preperation for his follow on novels which I think, were all 5 stars.The Mexican War was condensed into one book unlike his Civil War books about specific battles. All in all a good read and a good brief insight into the Mexican War."
3,Great book with limitations.,"I would give this a 5 star rating except I deduct a star for each limitation put on the purchase of this ebook. The publisher disables both lending the book and the text to speech option. Since I can't dictate what options they allow, I will just lower the star rating I give."
5,A Revolutionary History Tale,"This book is truly a masterpiece of American history. It tells the story of the American Revolution through the eyes of those who saw it. It is a novel, not a text book. And you can feel this. You become attatched to the characters in the book (even the British general) and it gives you a new point of view on a story told so many times before.A++++ work and I look forward to the sequel."
3,"good, but not great","The lyrics a lone sold me, but as far as the beat went, it just didn't have enough of a ring to it for me. If I were you, I would only buy this CD on a day when you're hopelessly bored and want to listen to something intersting."
4,Inspirational and Appealing,"She has really hit the mark with the album ""Pieces of You"". Most of her songs are frank and right to the point and I applaud her for it. But I don't really care for ""Foolish Games"" and steer clear of hearing ""Daddy"". The track ""Adrian"" can actually bring tears to your eyes, as well as the track ""Painters"". ""Angel Standing By"" is a sweet lullaby with only an acoustic guitar, but it is the best song on the CD. All in all, a good sale."
3,"Great but waz with the gong, Pieces of You?","I adore the songs Foolish Games, Morning Song, Near You Always, I'm Sensitive, Adrian and You Were Meant for Me but the songs Pieces of You and Daddy are just sick. Jewel's gotta lot of growing up to do and she needs to sing songs that will make people learn and feel good, not be depressed and filled with nasty thoughts. She has a beautiful voice and a wide range but she should use it for other songs. I loved Who Will Save Your Soul because of how deep it was but drop Pieces of You, Daddy and maybe Little Sister."
2,The CD was not as great as expected,"I love Jewel songs on the radio, but on the CD she just seems to be singing off-key. As for the other songs (the ones that I've had the patience to listen to), they're just plain weird. The CD just wasn't Jewel's best singing."
4,A standout in the past year,"Of the CD's I purchase last year, this is the only one that I play consistently. Jewel's voice is unusual and versatile, her lyrics strong, and the variety of music makes this CD one that stays in my car's CD changer. I only wish she had the Batman version of Foolish Games. I like the slower tempo."
1,Worst CD of the 90s,"Yes, the winner is THIS CD, who, despite plenty of competition, has won (by a narrow margin) the uncoveted title. Jewel is the worst. How did this yodelmeister ever garner more than a single star in any of the reviews? P.T. Barnum was right, I guess. When she's not going all soulful and whispery--after all, as one of her song titles informs the listener, she's so ""sensitive""--she's trying to get scat and Ella Fitzgerald, quite unconvincingly. She'd be hooted and pelted with rotten fish if she ever tried to pull that act at the Apollo! Sitting through this CD was like suffering through dental work--all queasy and nauseated, praying that it will end; yet, having inhaled laughing gas, getting an uncontrollable attack of the giggles during the procedure, waiting for the next moment of pain-hilarity to ensue."
1,Bad. Bad. Bad.,"Here's me when the Jewel album had just been released in my local CD store: ""Hmm, a new female folk singer, eh? Might not be too bad. Haven't heard any songs yet, but what the heck? I like woman folk singers with acoustic guitars.""Bad idea. Jewel's weak voice and amateurish melodies get on my nerves And all of that forced emoting about sex, drugs, violence, and...well you know, all that ""bad stuff""...would be laughable if it weren't so unlistenable.Oh well. About the only thing worthwhile about Jewel CD is the jewel case."
1,Please go back to your street corner,"Horrid. Jewel you get one star for this one. (Only Celine Dion could get no stars, if that were an option we were given). The girlish voice is annoying, the lyrics ripped straight from an angst-ridden teenager's diary. No this is definitely not for everyone. Jewel will do well in Nashville with her hurtin' songs and high-pitched wail. There is a definite lack of maturity, depth and insight here and it has taken a few good years before a lot of people have woken up and rightfully pitched this CD onto the no-talent scrapheap overflowing with bubble-gum chewing teens, Dion and Madonna et.al"
5,A beautiful album,"I've always been a fan of Jewel. I have 3 albums of her: ""0304"", ""You Were Meant for Me/Foolish Games"", ""The Wizard of Oz in Concert"", and now my new album of Jewel is ""Pieces of You"". When I listened to it, I loved it. Every song in this CD is beautiful, and Jewel's voice is gorgeous.~~~~~~~~~Who Will Save Your Soul? ~ 5 starsPieces of You ~ 5 starsLittle Sister ~ 5 starsFoolish Games ~ 5 starsNear You Always ~ 5 starsPainters ~ 5 starsMorning Song ~ 5 starsAdrian ~ 5 starsI'm Sensitive ~ 4 starsYou Were Meant for Me ~ 5 starsDon't ~ 5 starsDaddy ~ 5 starsAngel Standing By ~ 5 starsAmen ~ 5 stars~~~~~~~~Grade: A+++~~~~~~~~I recommend ""Pieces of You"" to all Jewel fans. I also recommend her new album ""0304"", it's awesome! :)"
4,Putting Jewel On the Map,"This album is the single reason Jewel is what she is today. Without this album I feel that Jewel would never have been able to establish herself musically, at least not to the point of success she has today. Raw, Untraditional, Brave, Naked, these can all descibe her first album. Unlike most other hit records this album is a nice departure from the norm. Worth a listen."
3,A Little Too.. Boring!,"This CD has some good tracks, but it's really hard to sit throught the whole thing. It's kind of monotonous. The lyrics are great, but with the music, you start thinking, ""Wait... haven't I heard this before on the same CD?"""
2,Good attempt...,"This album is all right - I do not rave about it, but I do not hate it. Some of the songs are new and refreshing, especially after so much machine sounding pop songs. These songs include ""Foolish Games,"" ""Little Sister"" and ""Who Will Save Your Soul."" But her voice kind of annoys me ... it changes from a terrible brassy to a bothersome whisper at the weirdest times. Honestly, I don't think this album is worth it ... if you want folk rock, you're better off with Joni Mitchell."
2,Pleeaaaaaaseeeeee!,"Today there are lot of untalented artist that claim they arereally talented such as Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton and those kind og garbage. The one who started that was Jewel. This girl from Texas or whatever made this album which has probably one of the most non-exicting collection of songs ever put on an album before. Her voice is not very good and when she sings it's like she has a fever or something and has just thrown up. It's that bad. The music isn't very interesting. She is clearly copying Joni Mitchell ( who is another overrated singer, but has created some amazing songs). The lyrics are not good either and knowing that over 11 million people bought this album just shows how the music industry is becoming more like a circus."
2,Pretentious,This album reeks of pretentiousness. Most of the songs are overwritten and just too damn serious. Jewel has a gorgeous voice but this doesn't do it for me. Come back brighter...and lighten up.
1,"A crown ""drool"" of an album","Jewel's attempt at a pop gem is a complete, utter and wholly unmitigated failure. The songs all sound the same, her lyrics are sad at best and insulting at worst. Should be a hit with the less intelligent end of the Pre-Teen demographic. Saps. Ignore this album and her poetry book as well, spend your money on the new Kenny G album instead! He has better hair and lyrics..."
2,WARNING: NOT what you hear on the radio/videos.,"I listened to the singles from this album, ""Foolish Games"", and ""You Were meant For Me"" on the radio and on VH1 and loved them so much I figured the album was worth buying for these two alone. I stand by that thought. The problem is that when you actually GET the album, it's like some sort of horrible bait and switch! The songs are the same, but the recordings are different. The accompanying music (especially in Foolish Games) that sounds so melodic and beautiful on the radio and in the music videos now sound entirely mediocre, as do the rest of the songs. I was SO dissapointed. Thank God for mp3's."
2,did i mention she sounds like a five year old?,"jewel, you have a magnificent voice. so lets get some lyrics in there that actually mean something? 'i break the yolks to make a smiley face'? jesus, if i wanted to hear that, i would turn on some weird al. there is little diversity in songs, and her voice (actually very good) is often reduced to a soft moaning. that was my exact reaction i had by the second time i had heard this cd!"
3,Pieces of crap!,"This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. Jewel overloads the listner with her sickingly child like voice and sugary sweet crapola lyrics!! I could have sworn at times that I was back in kindergarten listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks, only difference being the Chipmunks had talent. While this album does show that Jewel has some, albeit very little, musical talent she just has no song writing ability at all. Maybe one day she will make a break through but I doudt it, don't look for her to ever have another hit song, ever again."
2,Fantastic Voice But Weird Songs,"I bought this album when ""You were meant for me"" came out having liked ""Who will save your soul"" before that and loving the latest single. I was really disappointed. The rest of the album is nothing like the previously mentioned singles plus the beautiful ""Foolish Games"" the last single released from the album. Her voice is positively amazing but apart from the three singles the songs were not my taste. The best word i can think of to describe them is weird. I think her lyrics are much better as poems and just don't work as songs. But hey, its just my opinion and obviously she appeals to many people. I must say that her second album ""Spirit"" is much much better. The songs are great and her voice is even better especially on ""Enter From the East"". So, if you are buying this album going by the success of the 3 singles I'd tell you to get ""Spirit"" instead."
2,a psuedo-poet's attempt at hitting it big time...,"This has got to be some of the worst music I have ever heard. Not only does Jewel manage to turn such trivialistic matters as leaving the cap off the toothpaste tube into a life and death situation, but the lyrics are incredibly melodramatic, evoking the same drama any kindergartener is apt to exhibit after realizing mom mixed the jelly with the peanut butter on his sandwich. Every now and then one hears some glimmering hint of decent musicianship, but overall Jewel is just a would-be poet attempting to sell her b.s. poetry on record to a music scene already riddled with nonsensical,untalented,playground angst. I only gave her two stars because she at least is good looking..."
2,A pair of catchy singles don't a decent album make,"With a pair of catchy singles, Jewel's debut offers some promise, but, burdened with lots of filler, is unable to deliver the goods. Those who seem to have her pegged as the great female folkie hope, would do much better to look into the works of Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked and Lucinda Williams.Better luck next time."
3,"I think this cd had some amazing songs, and some terrible","This cd has some very good material on it. Jewel is a very talented singer. Earlier, I would've rater this as 4 or five, but not after her new cd came out. Her new cd has much more ""spirit"" and magic in the making of it."
4,I LOVE THIS CD,"I BOUGHT THIS CD WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT-- I LOVED IT THEN AND I LOVE IT NOW. I HAVE ACTUALLY LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MUSIC AND SINGING SINCE I HAVE BEEN LEARNING MORE ABOUT JEWEL. I HAVE READ THE BOOK ""A NIGHT WITHOUT ARMOR"" AND I LOVED IT TOO. JEWEL HAS BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO ME!"
4,I think that Jewel's CD Peices of you is one of the best .,"I love this Cd. I listen to it when I'm studying or as I'm going to bed or if I just want to relax. She so bold about the world in her songs . It's very neat(EX The song Ugly girl)Although as much as I like it , it is somewhat depressing to listen on how the world is through her eyes a song that reminds me of this is (Adrian) but I still think she's an amazing singer/songwriter. She 's got talent . I like her soo much that I bought her newest Cd Spirit.It's really good too. Almost better than the first."
5,it's good...,"i got this as a christmas present and i so badly wanted to give it away, the first time i heard it it was so boring....but then i gave it a chance and listened to it a couple more times and i was hooked!"
5,artisticly satisfying,"I was amazed at the passionate lyrics when I first heard the cd. I didn't really care for her at first....the track who will save your soul sort of annoyed me while it played non stop on the radio stations, but after giving the rest of the disk a chance, i was trully ""wowed"". She not only had the voice of an angel, but the musical talent of a goddess, and has a great poetic touch in her lyrics. I was not only moved but inspired by her music. I, being a painter, often listened to jewel to inspire some of my pieces. I guess I could tell her that ""I have pieces of you in my studio"". All in all..a great piece of work..a true ""jewel"" to the music world."
3,I liked it and hated it at the same time...,"The songs I've heard on the radio and saw videos for on TV are mostly the only ones I liked on this album. I think Jewel has a beautiful voice, but I don't know why I was slightly disappointed. I must add that some of the songs, like ""Daddy"", scared me a bit!"
3,Not so great,"I bought this cd because I heard ""Foolish Games"" on the radio. I thought it would be really good, but it's not. There was too much negativity in the songs. ""Foolish Games"" and ""You Were Meant For Me"" are the only songs worth listening to."
5,A Cd that lets you listen at anytime and feel good!,"I love this CD and I never stop listening to it. I have favorite songs but I do not dislike any of the other ones. I think I really enjoy ""Little Sister"" and ""Adrian"" the best. Some of the songs are depressing but some make me happy. Whatever mood I am in, I can always listen to this CD over and over again. I DEFINITLY THINK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD GO OUT AND BUY IT!"
2,A few good songs,"I got the CD for my birthday. I thought it would be good because ""Who Will Save Your Soul"" was good. I saw the video on VH1. But when I actually listened to it I found out for the most part the CD sucked. The only songs I really liked were ""Who Will Save Your Soul"", ""I'm Sensitive"", ""Near You Always"", ""You Were Meant For Me"" and ""Morning Song"". The rest sucked. If you are thinking of buying this CD I suggest you just borrow it and record the songs you like on a tape. I wish I had gotten a different CD for my birthday."
4,her best release,"this is true in MOST cases. The debut release is the best because the polishing has not yet occured. We hear Jewel here as true and simple as she ever was, back when she was still new. This album is a keeper.Stories like ""adrian"" and ""you were meant for me"" seem to resonate deeply with the sincerity of her lyrics.Sincere, Beautiful and courageous. What more can you ask for.I wish her second release had the same voice to it."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"I played this CD over and over again throughout 1995-96 and I still love it! Jewel has really become a self-expression guru of sorts since then. Her haunting voice and raw lyrics just drew me to her music and to her CD the same way it drew me to her sophomore album. But this debut is better, more raw, more heartfelt. She just sings (and writes) as it comes. Continues to be one of my all-time favorite CDs."
4,Still My Favorite,"Jewel's debut is still my favorite work from her. This recording, with a mix of studio and live work shows the artist/songwriter that first caught my attention. Her unique vocals on Save Your Soul and lovely interplay with cello on Foolish Games still reaches a very personal level for a performer. Her expressive style is an extension of Joan Baez and leads into new artists such as Mary Bristow."
3,This is Inspiring!,"I absolutely love this album! It inspiried me! I hope you buy this album, and enjoy it as much as I did!"
1,Please! Take this off my hands!,"I sympathize with the person who threw this away in disgust. I got this for Christmas. What were they thinking!? I tried to return it to the cd store, and they wouldn't give me a dime for it. I tried to give it to some friends: they said ""eeewwwwww"" - no, thank you. I don't know any bubble-headed sentimental fourteen year old girls, I guess.Jewel is the folk version of the Spice Girls. I like the Spice Girls better: they try to dance, and don't pass off banalities as revelation.Yucky yucky cd. Crummy lyrics. Consistently annoying. Shallow. Silly. Weepy. Gooey. Childish. Dumb. You get the idea...."
1,Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad,"The additional ""bads"" were necessary because this system forces me to give it at least one star.This is perhaps the worst music recorded in the past ten years. Childish pap."
1,Pieces of crap,"My friend bought this CD and then threw it in the trash a few days later. After listening to it at the music store I can see why. Jewel sounds like Tiffany with a guitar, or a Tiffany for the 90s, whichever way you want to see it. The only thing about her is that she writes her own lyrics. Unfortunately, those lyrics are of the teenage diary type. She offers up observations like ""You were meant for me/And I was meant for you."" That's so profound it belongs on that ""Really Deep Thoughts"" skit on Saturday Night Live. I'm sorry, but I prefer to hear a WOMAN's voice. Jewel sounds like she should be doing voice-overs for Sesame Street. While Pieces of You is well intentioned, it is so full of saccharine it makes me want to vomit."
1,Irritating album of the year or maybe decade,"This is the only CD I've ever purchased that I threw away in disgust. Only for the die-hard fans of Jewel. There's just two or three songs that don't sound like they were written (and sung) by a 10th grade high school kid who just broke up with her boyfriend. If you love her voice (and I do!), but hate sophmoric angst or treacle, buy her CD single."
1,"not really a review, just a comment","This is the BEST damn coaster ever. The music? It's like you've heard it all before, but now it's said in a way that's both cloying and tone deaf all at the same time. I guess if I had to live in a car, I'd recycle bad 70's a.m. radio and sell my soul too. But hey, if you've got condensation running down the side of your beer can, just throw this baby under it and leave the water-stains for another day. P.S. One of my cats killed himself after listening to this album. I love you, Fluffy, wherever you are."
2,Why???,"When I bought this CD, I felt I was cheated for they made different editions of ""Foolish game"" and ""You mean to me"" which sound very good on radio. I was so disappointed. I just can't understand this, it's really weird and I never met before. Jewel, if it's not your will, how could you stand this?"
4,"a perfect blend of compasion, vision and laughter.","Jewel has a soft spoken but powerful voice in her songs. She has a perfect blend of compasion, vision and laughter that everyone can enjoy. Saying things that are often felt but seldom said is hard enough without making it sound as wonderful as Jewel does."
4,"""Pieces of you"" became ""pieces of me""!","This album contains what I call very good music. Buying it was like a reflex to me : i heard it, i automatically bought it. It was a logical choice. If you like acoustic guitar, you'll be glad to hear Jewel perform : she has this incredible gift to make it sound beautiful and to sing along unforgettable melodies. She doesn't sound like anyone else.Jewel makes me proud to be a woman because She's proved that women have an inner musical strenght and their own sensibility! She's such an observing poet... She denounces our inhumane society in ""Who will save our soul"" and ""Pieces of you"", makes us cry (""Adrian"") or tells us so simply about love in ""Foolish Games"", ""You were meant for me"" and ""Pieces of you"", probably the best song of the album. You 've got to get this CD soon. One cannot live without having heard it !"
3,This is a good cd,"Jewel is one of my favorite singers. My favorite songs on this cd are ""You were meant for me"",""Who will save your soul"",""Foolish Games"" and ""Angel Standing By"". Great songs.Great voice."
4,For Mature Listeners Only,"When I first bought this cd, I was listening to the enhanced versions on VH-1 and the radio. So when I heard the cd, I hated it and put it away with the intent to sell. But recently I have discovered it again and realized how wonderful it is. Sweet and melodious, her simple arrangements give the album a refreshing change from some of the other hyped-up divas. Definately a good investment"
2,Unimaginative,"Many of Jewel's singing reminds me of a bad amateur coffe-house folk singer, with a lot of forced emoting and overwrought melodies about not a whole lot other than found love, lost love, and other typical topics.And am I the only one that thinks that the chorus of ""You Were Meant For Me"" sounds a whole lot like that old Kenny Loggins ""Even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey"" song?"
2,"say, you could make a nicer investment somewhere else","I do not need to say much, after 2-3 times listening to it, I got really tired of her. Maybe her next album is better, maybe worse that's what I'm pointing out now."
2,Don't waste your money,This is a terrible CD. The songs that they play on the radio every half an hour are great but the other ones on the CD are not worth your time listening to them. I could not decide if Adrian or I'm Sensitive ranks as the worst song of all time. There is a reason that her album sat on the shelves for more than a year before MTV started playing them and she became popular.
2,I think it was too depressing,"I do like Jewel. I just think it was too depressing, she has no happy songs. But they are good."
3,"Artistry not quite attained on ""Pieces of You""","Jewel's debut album, ""Pieces of You,"" certainly indicates that this girl has talent. Unfortunately, she wastes her gift on immature lyrics, melodies that are anything but melodic, and a tone that whines too much. On the other hand, perhaps such immaturity is to be expected, as she was a young girl of 19 when she composed most of the songs on this album. Let us hope that as she grows older, she will realize that quality, not quantity, distinguishes the true artists from the rest."
5,Absolutely fabulous,"Now, I don't usually like folkish music. I'm a huge fan of loud rock music (with some exceptions). My friend was moving away, and they were giving some CD's away, and my mom brought Jewel's CD home. I'd never really liked her that much. I'd go through stages where I'd like her, and then I just didn't really care. It took me a while (at least a couple months) to actually play the album, but when I did I was really impressed, more then I thought I'd be.It has a lot of her likeable, famous singles ""You Were Meant For Me"", ""Who Will Save Your Soul"", ""Foolish Games"", and tons of other fantastic ones that never made the top 40.She can really write songs. She's amazing. She has a very good voice. I don't really like the fact she recently became more pop-ish, but then again, a lot of singers are these days.It's a very good album, I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,"Good, but not great","This is a good CD, generally. I bought it for ""You Were Meant for Me"", but the song on the album is not the radio version. Also, ""Foolish Games"" is different than on the radio. ""Pieces of You"" (the song) is just plain stupid. I love the ""Morning Song"" and ""Angel Standing By."""
3,"If you're looking for deep, soulful,stuff stick w/ Tori Amos","Jewel has an uncommonly beautiful voice, but her lyrics are sappy and verrrry corny. I enjoyed it because of her anjelic voice, but when I listened deeper it made me cringe. I mean, in one of her songs, all she's talking about is rude words for ethnicities and homosexuals. It really made me mad."
5,My favourite CD all through these years,"Truly unsurpassed. After so many years, this CD is the one that I constantly play over many times. It breaks my heart each time I listen to Jewel sing ""Foolish Games"". Her talent and the evocativeness of her voice is amazing."
2,If her voice had matured....,"before the creation of this album - every song would be worth listening to a million times a day (if possible). The only thing I am going to say is this - what you hear on the radio off of this CD will NOT sound like what you get on this CD. Buy the singles if you want, but her second album is FAR better."
3,"Good, but.....","I got this CD a few years ago because I had liked ""You Were Meant For Me"" and ""Foolish Games"" and wanted to hear more. The first time I listened to the CD, I was really disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I like her and everything, but the CD lacks a certain magical something that lights up a CD and keeps you listening to it. The lyrics are bland and boring, few songs are what I would call meaningful, and the CD basically sounds like a collection of old folk songs that you're likely to forget rather than remember. You get used to her sound and the songs eventually, but this CD just isn't worth the hassle of trying to like it. Save your money for something better."
4,Captures the heart,"Jewel's first album is definately her best. I remember when Who Will Save Your Soul came out on the radio and on MTV...I hated it. then I got to listening to You Were Meant For Me and things seemed to improve. By the time I heard Foolish Games on the radio (radio edit has it's faults like losing some lyrics, but makes it up with a better last chorus) I was hooked on her voice and style. Folk-pop. Near You Always, Morning Song and Angel Standing By are incredible, but take a listen to Painters. Pure folk storytelling at it's best. You will cry...I'm warning you."
4,"""Pieces of You"" falls into a special place...","""Pieces of You"", the debut effort of now mega-star, Jewel, is a beautiful and soulful beginning to an already amazing career. Her music transcends fad and image to envelop the mind into quiet contemplation. Truly, her songs are artful! The famous, ""You Were Meant for Me"" in its original version on this album is tender and charming, where the obscure, ""Amen"", is chilling and haunting. This album embodies the grass roots effort of Jewel; where it all came from. Most tracks are simply her and her guitar and a real intimacy is achieved. Most of my descriptives thus far have included tender, and charming, but there is a real sense of power and force from this album - a power that is surreal and wrapped in her heavenly voice. This album is such a breath of fresh air from the modern angst and ""pain"", but this album is by no means bubble gun and sunshine. No words can really describe the aura of her music - so you'll just have to check it out for yourself!"
5,Jewel Rules!,I love this cd. It is one of my favorites. I've loved it since it first came out. I'm such a fan. I recommend it to anyone!
3,It grew on me...,"When I first bought this CD a couple of years ago, I hated it. I thought she had a beautiful voice and a wonderful acoustic sound, but the lyrics were horrible and the songs tedious. I did, however; give it many more chances, and now i really enjoy it. The songs other reviewers call ""weird"" have a simplistic beauty that I really enjoy. I think their meanings are even more than songs like ""You Were Meant For Me"". Take ""Pieces of You"". The first time I heard it, I was apalled. But after giving it repeated listenings, I found that it was very meaningful. The lyrics add insight into why we are prejudiced against certain groups of people...that being we are reminded of ourselves, and that scares us. It's not my favorite CD in my collection, but it's definitely worth giving a shot. She has a lot of talent."
3,Pretty good...but not as good as I expected.,"I had heard so many good things about Jewel before I bought the CD. I figured that I'd go to Muzika, (which is Russia's version of Sam Goody) and buy it. However, I only liked ""Who Will Save Your Soul?"", ""Pieces of You"", and ""Painters"". The music has nothing special about it. It sounds like too many other female artists I've heard."
3,Disappointing...,"I don't like this CD much...I heard ""You Were Meant For Me"" on the radio a few times and loved it-My aunt got this CD for me but I found that on the CD ""You Were Meant For Me"" was really bad, half the time Jewel sounds like she's just a little girl and the other half like she's got something stuck in the back of her throat and is a guy...""Little Sister"" is pretty good, though the lyrics are down right ugly. ""Foolish Games"" and ""Painters"" are great. Spirit is much better, go buy that instead of Pieces of You. The lyrics to ""I'm Sensitive"" are good, but it's has really happy music that makes me want to gag when I listen to it, it could have been such an emotional piece...*sighs*"
3,"Good tunes, but the lyrics suck","The music on this album is for the most part terrific, and I found myself humming it for days afterwards. But the lyrics are terrible. They're full of the most banal and obvious sentiments (like the KKK is bad), written in the most terrible ""verse."" It's like the poetry of a really naive eighth-grader, set to music that deserves better."
2,Corny as hell,"I don't know what to think about all the previous reviews for this piece of drivel. I feel almost sad for a generation of teenagers that thinks this is the deepest emotional sentiment they can find. I will say her voice is heavenly. If she could just drag herself out of the 60s, maybe she can make some real music. Since I've been a fan of people who can real lyrics like Neil Peart (Rush) and Peter Gabriel, it's a big disappointment to see how popular meaningless crap like this has become. I'll really like Jewel if she grow up and puts some real meaning into her songs, but for now I won't waste my money."
1,No Jewel in this Crown,"My first experience listening to Jewel was actually in concert. She opened for Edwin McCain and as it seemed, more people were there for her, though I couldn't understand why. Then I realized. They wanted to hear her do everything but sing. Talk about being from Alaska, not sing. Speak her ""songs"", not sing. YODEL, not sing. Like many before her (insert 80's female pop star here), Jewel is just hitting at the right time. Her songs (both spoken and sung) are nothing but simple little jaunts, one liners turned into short but boring stories. (""Who Will Save Your Soul"" and ""You We're Meant For Me"") Pieces of You demonstrates exactly how, given the right mixture of looks, promotion and timing, a person like Jewel (and enough with the one name thing already) can soar without having a ton of ability."
1,BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!,How can anyone listen to this fodder? Ani Difranco absolutely destroys her on every level. Jewel's nursery-rhyme lyrics about toothpaste and pj's are nauseating to say the least. I can't find one redeeming quality about her when I know that artists like Ani Difranco and Tori Amos are out there who write profoundly beautiful music. On top of that those two are light years ahead of her in the songwriting department.
3,"entertaining, inspiring appetizer","While the stories are refreshing, entertaining and inspiring, I found this work limited in scope and not exactly original. Yes, positive attitude is crucial to leading or moving toward any level of success, but for those who need something more substantial in their reading investment, this work was more an enticing appetizer than anything else.I would love to see Maxwell develop his ideas and generate some new, more ""mind blowing"" and revelatory messages to set him apart from other self-help authors.On the up side, it's a nicely priced book that serves a purpose."
5,Attitude determines Altitude,"This is a great book. I am a big Maxwell fan, and I loved reading this book. It is a compilation of chapters from some of Maxwell's other bestsellers. This book serves as a great reminder of how important our attitude is in every area of life."
3,Important For Quality of Life!,"Attitude has long been acknowleged as a key to success in every aspect of life, and this book by Maxwell is a fine introduction to the subject or even a refresher for those who have a few years between them and their last read of ""The Power of Positive Thinking"" or ""How to Win Friends and Influence People."" An excellent companion to this work would be Clint Arthur's ""9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power"" which presents an avante garde approach to improving every aspect of life through mastery of the elements of ecstasy. Or for those more interested in an audio-visual approach, his ""New Free Sex"" lectures on DVD present a spiritual approach to lovemaking sure to put a smile on your face! In my book, there's more than one way to skin a great attitude!"
2,more llike leadership 001,"I read the book in 20 minutes. That usually means that there is nothing here worth dwelling on. For a 5-minute PowerPoint presentation on leadership, this is all you need. To actually build leadership skills and examine leadership and leaders, move along to a real book. Unless you want to hear more about how great John Maxwell thinks John Maxwell is as a leader, look at Good To Great. I'm glad I got it used for $2.00."
2,"Attitude, good or bad, is like DNA.. It doesn't change with time or by reading books.","This book says that good attitude is better than negative attitude in the workplace, to which i agree.. Don't we all? without needing to read the book?"
4,"A small shot of ""positive attitude"" everyday","This short book is one of those ""daily"" readers to help you through some rough patches in your attitude. I've read so many self help books and I tell you the true value is to read a little bit of them everday to make sure you are in good spirits. The problem with most self help books is that once you read them the reader thinks life will instantly get better. These kinda books are written to be ""sipped"" on everyday to slowly change your habits and attitudes. This book is exactly the kind that should be referenced often and like a daily vitamin, good for your health."
2,Mopping Up,"My Pro Twist mop has a stiff brush at the bottom of the mop for hard to remove spots, stains and stuck on matter from tile floors. (My dogs are 18 and 15 years old and accidents happen.) I use my mop daily and it works beautifully without much effort at scrubbing so I ordered this refill and was very disappointed to find that there was no brush at the bottom but rather a small ""scuff eraser"" which will not do the job I need it to do and is not that great on scuff marks either. If this information had been included in the description, I would not have ordered it."
3,I have a MUST READ about this product,"My son (now 4 months) did not love the play mat. We put him on his back and he was unable to reach the toys. We decided to purchase another mat and use this as an exersaucer only. We put him in at 3 1/2 months (he has good head and neck control) He loved it. There was a lot to play with. I thought it was great. Then after only playing with it for two weeks, I noticed the PAINT WAS CHIPPING on the beach ball. I don't believe he ingested any of it, but I dont know what would happen if he did. I have written to evenflo and have not received a responce. MUST READ BEFORE YOU BUY"
5,EXCELLENT EXERSAUCER,"I love this exersaucer for a few reasons. Besides my baby loving it, I love the fact that it folds down and folds up easily so that it can be taken places, and also for storage inside the house. I also love the fact that the toys are removable, and washable. We took it to a friend's house, where there was another baby, so we just washed the toys, and let that baby play in it. Also, had I known that this starts out as a gymini and then converts to the megasaucer, I wouldn't have bought a separate gymini! The only negative thing was, getting the clear spinning ball to fit was hard! The metal bar that fits in, is too long, so it took GREAT effort to get it in. But overall, this is one of the best products we bought for our baby."
4,Great Activity Center! My baby loves it!,"This thing is great! We used the Playmat for his first 3 months, and then we converted it to the Saucer. He really loved the Playmat and so far, he really loves the Exersaucer! (He is 4 months now.)My only complaint with the Playmat Stage is the metal bar around the edge - sometimes I would kneel on it and it would hurt. I was always worried my baby would squirm over to the edge and end up with his head on that hard metal bar. Ouch!! He never did though, and he had a lot of fun times on that mat! :)The Saucer Stage is great, too. My only complaint is the toybar with the hanging toys is really stupid for this Stage. It's great for the Playmat, but for the Saucer, the toys either hang behind baby's head or right in his face. Very stupid design. I took that thing right off and replaced it with 2 EvenFlo ""Switch-a-Roos"" (Chewy Fish and B is for Bee)4 stars from me!"
1,Dangerous,"After only 2 weeks of use, 2 of the legs would not lock into place. The hinge mechanism is poorly made. I would buy a non-folding one."
3,Daughter loves it; not the best quality,"My four-month old daughter appears totally mesmerized with product. Unfortunately, the sea shell cup stopped working after only two days."
5,ExerSaucer,"We bought this for our Grandson for Christmas. He is 6 months old, and it seems to be a HIT!! Very pleased with the purchase, and would highly recommend it."
3,Not the best quality,My daughter's preschool has this model in their nursery play area. Well the DS is now 3 months old and is ready for a saucer.I've had saucers before with my other 2 children but got rid of them while pregnant with my son because I intend to purchase a new model. So I thought maybe this cute one would be a good fit.The legs are not as secure as the traditional saucers and the play mat is not the best quality and IMO does not look as good as the traditional hard bottomed saucers and seems like it would be a pain to clean. The toy bar is cute but overall I thought this saucer was not going to be a good fit for what I am looking for.So I give it 3 stars for the cute appeal but take 2 stars away for what I see as a poor design.
5,Love this Exersaucer for affordable price,My daughter loved this Exersaucer... really like the soft material bottom for her feet. She enjoyed all the great gadgets on this item. A++.
2,Be Careful with ExerSaucers,"All of the Evenflo ExerSaucer models have jagged notched lower edges on the plastic seat ring so that you can lock it into a stationary position. There were tiny sharp plastic barbs on the corners of those notches on ours and I scraped by baby's leg on one when lifting her out. She cried and bled and I felt terrible. Evenflo sent me a new seat ring and I can tell that they sanded those corners. It's better, but be very careful with one out of the box. I went to the store and felt the floor models and they also had sharp spots. The Baby Einstein version doesn't have the cut-outs so may be safer."
2,Beware of buying CD's based on a single song.,"If you are going to buy this CD based on the < Oi Dai> song, you will be somewhat disappointed. The only tracks that live up to the moving power of the < Oi Dai> are <Tantsukolena> and maybe <Tupa Taynna Tuppasuita>. Definitely listen to the samples before purchasing this CD."
4,Little Drill Does Good,"I needed this drill to put a few holes in a recently set porcelain tile floor. It was inexpensive ($18) compared to professional quality drills used by the tile store (wellover $100), so I didn't expect to get more than a couple of holes in hard porcelain. I drilled four holes through the porcelain and four more through the old ceramic tile underneath without much trouble. The little diamond burrs on the outer edge of the tip wore off quickly and I thought that was it. Yet I soon discovered a need to drill three more holes. What do you know, but it did those just fine. I expect there are several more holes to go with this little gem. I didn't use the water trough as I was drilling on the floor and it is for walls. But I did use it to center the drill on the floor, but any wood or plastic guide would do."
4,Worth the Money,"Overall worked great for what I needed. I had to cut 4 holes in porcelain tile shower walls. I used a masonry bit for the first 2 holes which took about an hour a piece. The first hole took about 5 mins with this bit. The last hole was a bit slower, but so much easier than the other bit. Works as advertised. The water cooler/guide system helped to start the hole, but the cooling system didn't work well. I used a spray bottle. It was helpful to get the hole started though. Didn't stay on the wall well. I may be able to get a few more holes, but not sure, but worth the money for a diamond bit, only way to go with porcelain."
3,Hitachi drill bit,"Drilled holes in porcelain floor tiles. First took 50 min, 2nd took 1hr, up to 2 hours for the eighth one. The hole drilling template was very useful. The plugs were easy to remove from the core bit. Just took a very long time to drill."
3,Diamond Core Bit (ceramic tiles),"This tool was is exactly what I needed for my ceramic wall tile, the dianomd core bit has a water cooler vile.The water cooler was very useful but, it needs a little work (leaks)Keep in mind not to use high rev's or you'll burn the tip, I used an 18v hand drill. Thank you"
3,"Good deal, but",a blade came with the saw (unadvertised) so I didn't need to purchase the Pack. May not use for years :-(
1,This blade should NOT have the dewalt name on it - it TERRIBLE !!!!,"So, i have the dewalt 18v cordless saw w/ lithium batteries, brand new... i made a few 2x4 cuts and some 1/2-inch ply wood cuts and this blade started smoking the wood... it is a terrible blade.The 18tooth blade is terrible... and so is the 24tooth.... just as bad...I actually bought this pack and returned it... i thought maybe i just wore it out too fast... not the case... dewalt has a horrible product they put their name on.I was looking for a replacement here on amazon. I found the Freud 24tooth blade for $10 shipped w/ amazon prime... WOW - the Freud Blade is AMAZING.... Do not waste your money with this dewalt saw blade....I can't believe dewalt has made such a horrible product with their name on it... I know its the blade that came with the saw, and its the starter blade... but to only make a few cuts is terrible!!!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS BLADE"
5,DeWalt blades,"Great blades, great price and fast delivery. They are perfect for a variety of wood cutting, ripping, crosscutting, etc. Nice combination for a 2 pack."
2,A single declarative sentence will do,"I find no fault (or very little) with the stance Lind takes in developing his vision of a Fourth American Republic. Where I find fault is in the writing style. I felt he often took a paragraph to get a point across when a carefully crafted sentence or two would have sufficed. Example? Start on page one and start reading. I found his ""style"" tedious and even laborious at times. Still, the subject is important and well worth a book - just not this one."
2,"Readable, but full of mistakes","Ironclads have been neglected by naval historians. However, they could be considered the ancestors of the battleships and they saw a lot of fighting. So, their history remains largely to be written. This book is an attempt to cover that void. But do not be fooled by the need to complete your personal naval library. I am not knowledgeable in all the campaigns described but the chapters concerning the south american wars are waste and I have my doubts about the japanese civil war. This book can be used as a limited basis to develop your knowledge about these ships, but do not accept it as a gold standard or you will perpetuate many wrong concepts in your understanding of naval warfare."
2,"Not a history book, an opinion book","Most works dealing with history are carefully researched and are backed up by other sources. You can find where the author gets his or her information by reading the citations.You won't find citations in this book...not one. You're reading nothing but a book of opinions. you may agree with those opinions or not but that's all they are in this book.Several of his claims are simply not true, such as stating that Washington was the richest man in America...hardly but it makes for a good story, a Marxist story; the richest assuming power. The reoccurring theme in Zinn's work is that of class conflict. Read Marx if you want, but this is little more than a man's opinion of American history through the distorted view of a Marxist."
1,Ugh!,"Our daughter had to read this for school and she hated it! My husband was a history major in college and he didn't like it either. She described Zinn as very liberal, he put down the Americans that she had been educated to respect, and painted a very bleak picture of American colonization and history. She said he seemed very unpatriotic. We explained to her that different people have different views of our country's history, but it is very difficult to read things that go against everything that you believe in."
1,A People's Hisotry of the United States,Author is a total communist/marxist. I am upset that my child had to purchase this for school. Will take it up with my congressman.
1,Propaganda,"THIS-->""to the pernicious way in which left wing, anti American professors have steadfastly forced unsuspecting students to buy it. I was a victim of this so many years ago. My professor was a confessed communist and like Zinn, admitted that he despised America.""~by 'Fortunato'"
5,The real History and the truth.,"This is the real History of America with all of its good and bad things, not just the candy,coated History you received in public school."
5,People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present,"This is an amazing book. Every American needs to know the little-known history of the United States that is brought out by Howard Zinn's painstaking research. It is not always a happy story, but since those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it--it is a story that we need to know.This book should be mandatory reading for every member of the U.S. Government."
5,An eye opening look at American history,Fantastic book which offers up a viewpoint on history which few have been exposed to. A must read for any history buff.
3,Dissent is good for Democracy and History,"Good to have as many views of US History as possible, final decisions of what one believes should be decided by YOU the reader."
4,passing it on,"i bought this book for my grandson, not only to help him learn american history, but to try to refresh an appreciation for books and the wonders that recide inside their pages. i am confident that this was accomplished and am quite happy."
5,Should be read by any serious student of American history,"Howard Zinn is one of the most important historians of the 20th century, and this is his seminal work. ""People's"" should be read by every American, regardless of class or age. A wonderful journey through the nation's life, with both triumph and tragedy at every turn. A classic of US history and one of the most important books of the 20th century."
1,Crap,"With people from the far left of the spectrum, we would not have the United States! Do not waste your time - go to the ""A Patriot's History of the United States""."
3,The book was good for the first few chapters,"It gave insight to history from a different POV and I thought it was great. However, as I read further, it felt like that book was just too gory and depressing and tended to repeat the stories but with different names and settings."
5,An alternative view of history,"I bought a copy of this book for myself and copies for my grandchildren.Is it a biased interpretation of US history? Yes, but if you study history with an open mind you quickly realise that all recorded history is biased.Does it challenge conventional interpretations and at times unveil facts that portray the US in a bad light? Again, yes it does but why do so many reviewers seem to fear or find this offensive?Personally I believe that investigating alternative viewpoints is an important learning tool. No matter what the subject is.To quote George Santayana, ""Those that forget the past are condemned to repeat it"".If we as individuals or as a nation are to progress and improve we must continue to learn and apply what we learn from history."
5,An Actual History of the U.S.,"This is an excellently composed book composed of primarily First hand sources, unaltered and unbiased.This is everything your high school teachers are not teaching and that textbooks ignore as they are an exercise in citizen building.This does not represent a political lean, and is simply a beautiful review of commonly overlooked first hand sources.This will open your eyes to many facts about the United States for any person and that a person who is absorbed in the propaganda and statism of the country would other wise never acknowledge.Ignore all the one star reviewers, they were clearly simply outraged and offended at this unabashed look at the truthful brutality of our past and many injustices.Recommended for anyone who wants to learn about American history from the sham of Columbus onward."
2,The Left's Perspective,"(Surprise ending to review) I have to say the book was enjoyable but also very sickening. America's long history is filled with a lot of evil leaders, diplomats, discoverers, teachers, students, and.... let's just say people. The victims are countless; this book tells their story.... in vivid detail mind you. I myself read the book long ago. However, I recently had to come to Afghanistan, sit in a guard tower, and listen to the newer end of the book (audiobook) told by Issacson himself. Basically he blames America for 9/11 and feels we have no business in the country I currently serve in, even at the very beginning. I don't know your politics but there it is. Now here is my opinion, I no longer trust him, or any of his observations about America's past. Honestly worth reading, but with one eye shut!"
1,the fox in the chicken coup,"Mr. Zinn is an avowed communist and has never denied it. To have American history re-written by someone like him is a sin. Best American history book is written by Paul Johnson, an English scholar who loves and admires America.Marian Diamond, Ph.D."
2,A complete waste of time Unless your an imbecile,"Of course in the history of our American history it is inevitable that HOTUSA would be published. Zinn didn't create anything revolutionary. Literature provides hardly the first step towards revolution. But atmospherically journeying through HOTUSA the reader clearly gets an awakening. The book overall is completely useless. If you want to go do something deny the false democracy we live in and launch a discourse against the institutions (like our useless education system and government) that control, manipulate and dominate the minds of supposedly ""free"" individuals."
1,Overrated by those who want it to be good,"This was one of the most overrated books I have ever read. It seems that this book is so highly regarded because the academic establishment (the very one he lambastes) wants so badly for it to be considered a great work, and it is the only one of its kind. My problem with it is threefold, but simple:1. Mr. Zinn does not seem to grasp basic economics or political science.2. Mr. Zinn's historiography is spurious at best. Throughout the book, to establish a trend or make a point, he will use one or, maybe, two quotes.3. Mr. Zinn confuses his opinion with fact, and sees everything in our history as a black or white issue."
5,Good review,"This is a very honest yet critical presentation of the United States. The book doesn't tend to focus on the good of the country, but you can find that information in virtually every other history book (available at every primary and secondary school near you). Unfortunately, the truth can be a little depressing at times. If you don't realize major corporations (and the elite groups that run them) have a profound influence on our lives in the United States and throughout the world, then you should read this book. This is definitely the most entertaining and insightful history book I've ever read."
2,Too much preaching. Too little history.,"In Howard Zinn's attempt to tell the story of the poor and oppressed, he forgets to tell the history. Anyone hoping to brush up on their American history will be sorely disappointed."
4,great start,"theis story starts out really well, then gets harder to read because it is more of the same over and over"
4,"Good read, recommendable....","Great read and I would recommend it to anyone! It would have gotten 5 stars, but to me, he seemed to drag some of the subjects a little long. I guess this book should be required reading before being able to vote in this country, considering the terra incognita most U.S. citizens have for oneselfs own country,(Historically/Politically). Lest the reader can agree/disagree and can vote, caveat emptor!"
5,Great Book,I enjoyed reading this book very much. It was interesting and informative and easy to follow. I plan on rereading it again soon.
5,History of the US,A book that should be read! What strikes me is the struggle of the working people in a country that is afraid of socialism
1,Totally my fault,"It's my fault that I did not research this book a bit more carefully before I put it on my Christmas ""wish list"".It's my fault I had no idea who Howard Zinn was and what his agenda is.It's my fault my brother-in-law wasted his money buying me this book.It's (apparently) my fault--or at least the fault of all white-European-descended men--that America is based on bloodshed and exploitation of the peaceful and virtuous poor.But it's Zinn's fault that I only got as far as page 10 in this partisan revisionist history novel.I'm fine with factual history--warts and all. And I know our history isn't always pretty. But to present an opinion piece disguised as a text book is a typically devious liberal tactic. The scariest part is that students might actually read this and believe every word--precisely what Zinn encourages them NOT to do with ""traditional"" history books.Only good for a doorstop, which is what I will have to use it for to avoid spreading this garbage to others."
1,I had to give it one star because you can't give zero,"I'm only giving this book a review because Amazon made the AMAZING decision to actually RECOMMEND this idiocy to me. Don't waste your time or your money on this book by the socialist Howard Zinn. Socialism is a political philosophy that has failed in every country where it has been tried. It is a loser, so is Howard Zinn, and so is anyone who thinks that this hogwash is 'history' of any sort worth repeating."
