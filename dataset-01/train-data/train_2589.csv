4,Delicious Documentary,"""Jiro Dreams Of Sushi"" is a fascinating and enjoyable treatment of a man,a culinary art and a culture all masterfully wrapped up in one great video presentation.You needn't enjoy Sushi or cooking to appreciate this documentary,but you will love it even more if you do.My only criticism is that a movie about a very tradtional Japanese manand a very traditional Japanese culinary art in Japan, a very traditional Japanese placeis set to a musical score of Western European music.It would have been so much better if the score was traditional Japanese music."
4,Worth it,"If you generally enjoy movies with a food related theme, Jiro Dreams of Sushi will satisfy. Not as visceral as others, but absolutely recommended."
3,it's not for my area,"The DVD it was in a different area, and nobody advise me.now i have to change the computer but i cant do this every time"
1,Region locked DVD won't play outside US,Sounds silly but I purchased this DVD from Amazon but can't play because of stupid region lock. So if you don't reside in US don't bother.
2,Poor Quality,"While the movie was wonderful, the streaming version from Amazon was unfortunately low quality. This made reading the subtitles very difficult."
5,If you love sushi you will love this movie and Jiro !,Jiro is a wonderful movie about the background of the culture of Sushi. If you love sushi you will be delighted with Dreams of Sushi. I can't wait to go to Japan and experience Jiro's restaurant !
4,Made me hungry,"Very interesting movie about someone completely dedicated/obsessed with making the perfect sushi. I enjoyed seeing the different aspects of preparation, supplying, training to reach that perfection. It did drag on a bit for me towards the end but well worth watching. We all went out to eat imperfect sushi after the movie."
3,For sushi lovers,"Recommended to me because I love sushi, but found it a little boring. Interesting but a little too much repetition ."
4,Cultural Eye Opener,Real account of Japanese view of tradition. Movie a little slow at start but redeems itself about 15 20 minutes into the film. If you love sushi you wild enjoy.
2,Brittle and cheap!,These glasses only last about 7 months before the lens popped out and the paint on the frame started to wear off. These are not up to normal Bolle standards. I was very disappointed... They seemed very flimsy when they were on my face. Beware and buy at your own risk!
3,"Good, but not the best","This Survivor Series was up their with the best but this one is not like the 1997 one with Bret Hart saying goodbuy in the way he didn't want to. Anyway this Survivor Series was was pritty good but because Austin didn't fight or the Rock didn't win, that's what stuff up the hole thing up for me. I must say to see it then if u like u buy."
4,Not a bad video,This video was actually pretty good to me while others said that it wasn't. I liked most of the movie except for the part that Stone Cold Steve Austin gets run over by Rikishi.
3,It was OK,"Well, I've watched it thousands of times, but it could of been better. I thought the match with Jericho vs. Chyna was pathetic. Chyna got hit in the head against the steel part of the ramp, got hit in the head with the championship belt, torchered through the walls of jericho, was powerbombed and bodyslammed and lionsaulted so many times the dumb girl would of been unconscious or dead. But no she gets up at the very end and does one pedigree to Triple HHH on the top of the ramp and wins...?? The got scrwed so much more and does one stupid move andwins...but whatever. Vinnie Mac kinda screwed this event up. It was a disappointment having Austin ran over. I think they should have waited until after the last match because millions of us watched it to see Austin. And the Big Show's not bad...but still. And then Vinnie came out right when Hunter was gonna win and smacks him over the head and screws up everything...i liked how Big Show eliminated all those guys though, especially Viscera...hehe"
1,worst of 99,this event was a real dissappointment.the main event was changed and had a real screwjob ending that was boring. the chyna/jericho match was a snooze for the most part. the tag title match was average. the survivor series team matches were horrible from start to finish. in my opinion dont buy or even rent this piece of wrestling mistake.
2,"By far, the worst Survivor series","""None of the matches were great, but plenty were awful."" That line has become common place in describing many wrestling ppvs of the last 3 years. While the ppv will always be a pivitol part in the WWF Championship, the ""whudunnit"" had the potential to be one of the best story lines ever and could have brought forth a revolutionay multi-month(maby a year) long feud between HHH and Austin. what turned out was a sory, very uninvolving ending pitting Rikishi(what?) as the car driver. HELO! This is not a good ending and the feud lasted all of four months. This could have been Hart vs. Austin of '97 resurected. Back to the ppv, the main event was a 3 star match, and Kane vs. X-Pac(does'nt ...!) got a 4."
3,WWF SURVIVOR SERIES 1999,"THE WWF SURVIVOR SERIES 1999 VIDEO WAS GOOD. MY FAVORITE MATCH WAS KANE VS. X-PAC. THE PPV WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST WWF PPV EVER IF AUSTIN WOULD NOT HAVE GOT RUN OVER. PUTTING THE BIG SHOW IN THE MATCH WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. THE TITLE MATCH WAS STILL GOOD, BUT GOT BETTER AT THE LAST FIVE MINUTES. THE OTHER MATCHES REALLY WERE NOT THAT GOOD THOUGH."
2,Very Dissapointing,"the main event was ok, but would have been great if austin didnt get hit by a car, and if someone like Kane or Mankind replaced austin instead of The Big Show. The Jericho vs. Chyna match was good, but, what the hell was with these damn elimination matches. did ne1 really care. i didnt, and these elimination matches took away from the whole event. i dont really even recoomending renting this 1"
3,Straight PPV. It's True! It's True!,"This was a very unpredictable event.One bad thing is that the crowd booed our one and only WWF olympic gold medal winner and all american hero Kirk Angel! He should have recieved much more respect and a much bigger pop from the crowd.It's True! It's True! This PPV also featured moments of sadness and sorrow when Austin got hit.I personally think that Billy Gunn was driving that car.Anyway,this PPV is worth the money."
3,Survivor Series was a bust,"The WWF Championship match was OK. the only reason I RENTED this video was that it was the one where Stone Cold was hit. The Women's Match was horrible, as well as some of the Survivor Matches. A really funny moment was when the Big Show came out by himself and destroyed the Boss Man's team. Rent it."
2,not a good Survivor Series,"This ppv was very lame. The only good matches were chyna vs Chris jericho, HHH vs Rock vs Big show and the hardy boyz/edge/christion vs Too Cool/holly cousins was decent. The 3 other Survivor Series matches were bad, and Kurt Angle vs Staciak was probaley the worst match in WWF history. So if you like exiting WWF events I wouldn't recomend Survivor Series"
4,Great transformer for any age.,"Cybertron excellion is one of my favorite deluxe class figures of the cybertron line. His car mode is nice and sleek with pop out wings for a nice speedy look. The robot mode is also pure genius. He looks so simple but the articulation on this guy is just amazing! Aside from fingers and toes this guy has as much flexibility as you do. (possibly less if you are an Olympic athlete but I digress.) Excellion is super durable and easy to transform making him ideal for younger kids or parents that don't want to hear their children asking for help with it every two minutes! Simply put, Cybertron Excellion is a great toy for any age collector."
5,Great IR filter,Great IR filter. Very reasonable price/Good quality. Fast shipper. Recomend to all. I will buy from them again.
3,"Good IR filter, bad brand","The Filter works good for a camera with the function of night vision, but i really don't recommend the opteka brand. The first day i use this filter, the crystal assemblage brakes down.El filtro de la cámara funciona muy bien para cámaras con función de fotografía nocturna -Panasonic Lumix FZ7s-"
1,not good,"that all i can say, will some extra and get a hoya filter.quality photo afcted with this filter, image are not sharp."
1,Not for D300,"I took a chance on this item hoping it would work on my D300, and so far I have had no l luck. I don't get anything even in direct sunlight. Maybe someone can show me how to work it as per experience, otherwise it's a waste of money."
4,Bueno para infrarojas pero no como RX,"Para tomar fotos infrarrojas funciona muy bien en blanco y negro. Para tomarlas a color es otra cosa. Depende de la cámara y es un poco mas complicado, sobre todo si deseas lograr los resultados de fotógrafos profesionales, las fotos a color suelen ser modificadas en la computadora.Si lo quieres como X-Ray dejame decirte que en la caja no lo dice por ningún lado y la verdad yo aun no logro ningún resultado."
3,Infrared Filter,"This filter probably works fine, but most digital cameras are blocked from infrared. So at least for me it was a waste of money."
3,i'm sure it would work fine IF...,"I'M SURE THIS PRODUCT WOULD WORK FINE IF MY CAMERA HAD A FUNCTIONING IR OUTPUT. OTHERWISE THIS ITEM IS USELESS TO ME. HOWEVER, I USUALLY BUY MY ITEMS FROM THIS SELLER. THEY ALWAYS SEND THE THINGS I ORDER ON TIME, IF NOT AHEAD OF TIME. JUST DO NOT EXPECT TO READ THROUGH INK, OR HAVE EVERY LITTLE STRAIGHT BOY'S DREAM OF SEEING THROUGH THE GIRL NEXT DOOR'S CHLOTHES, UNLESS YOU HAVE AN IR FUNCTION ON YOUR DEVICE.I LOANED IT TO A FRIEND, AND SHE CLAIMS IT WORKS GREAT, BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN THE PHOTOS TAKEN FOR MYSELF... YET."
2,pretty convinced this is lower that 720 nm - no false color!,"I've tried using this filter with an Oly c2020z, and despite every tweak in WB, every possible setting on the camera, every photoshop channel mixer swap page with advice, I'm finding there are no false color possibilities with this filter - if you're interested in b/w infrared only, you'll be happy with this filter. It does render foliage very white.Suspect this is filtering at a non r72 range. It's doing too good a job for my liking.I hope this proves helpful for those with a similar camera, seeking infrared color possibilities."
1,Came with visible marks on the filter,"Well it's cheap, it has a high cut-off, and I cant say I am all that impressed with it at all. This is not a coated filter, instead it is just colored glass. While it does filter to the IR range, I would recommend essentially any other brand. It even came with marks on the glass, presumably from uneven dying."
3,potential?,"I bought this to use with my Nikon D5000 for my photography class, and I've tried everything...from changing white balance and ISO to slow shutter speeds even up to 30 seconds and still just get a blank image. The only thing I can get it to pick up on is when i point a remote directly at it, but then again that's the only thing I can see in the image, a little lit up spot. I've done a lot of research on how to get it working and i'm just going in circles. Maybe I just don't know how to use it right? I don't know i'm desperate to get it working but it just isn't. any help would be appreciated."
4,Inexpensive way to get started with IR,"I purchased this as an alternative to the nearly $80 Hoya filter. I think for those of us that just want to experiment that this filter will work just fine. I was able to capture IR images on my first try using this in conjunction with my D40. Keep in mind that the Nikon D40 and a few other models are well known for their lack of a substantial IR filter built in to the camera, so these models may perform better than your camera.If you're serious about IR photography, I would recommend spending the additional on a better name/quality filter and researching which model cameras come from the factory without too much IR filtering built-in."
1,The cost of the labels is extreme,The cost of the Brady labels are so extreme you'll have sticker shock. I was just quoted a price of $775 per box for the TSL2200 label. We've used the TLS thermal printer for years. Though it works well most of the time the price of the replacement labels is just too expensive. Time to find a new labeling system. Due to the price I wouldn't even give this product 1 star.
4,Expensive labels but great for big network cabling jobs,Save yourself a ton of work by printing all of your labels in advance. Very spendy labels though.Came with everything you need to get going.
5,Should Be in The Top 10 on Amazon,"22 hit songs, 6 great Videos, from the pioneers of Reggaeton. This product has the best Artists, best DJ's, and best producers that helped put Reggaeton on the Map. Hector y Tito, Baby Shaba, Renato, Rey Pirin, Nicky Jam, Gaby, Alberto Styles, DJ Nelson, Traficantes, T-Quest, and a bunch more. It also has a nice tune from Luz y Jose (new duet- keep a look out for them). This is not a Puerto Rican package,Panamanian Package, or some other regional hodge podge of songs thrown together for a quick buck. This is truly the best of the best."
5,Slammin Good,"This package has somethin for all beings, all places, all styles. Whether you are Rican, Panamanian, E.E.U., or some place else, it covers the gambit. Nicky Jam, Alberto Stylee, Rey Pirin, My man Renato, Gaby (da meneaito man), Jan & Suppose, DJ Black, Hector and Tito, and all the gang. Plus some new tunes for T-Quest- Give a Holla to Tampa! and Luz y Jose. Cool traxs, cool package"
5,Great Collection,"My Boyfriend got me hooked on Reggaeton. I do not know what they are saying (I do not speak Spanish), but I love the rhythms. This particular package has some great music videos (high end, high class), and the music is very danceable. Great for parties. There are many Reggaeton packages out there, but for my money, this is one of the best. There is something for everyone. I really like the Puerto Rican Artists combined with the Panamanian Artists. Nice change of pace. I agree with the other reviewers, this should be in the Amazon top ten! So get out there and buy it. It is less expensive in the Amazon Marketplace for all you bargain hunters.Cheers!"
3,Revenging the death of an innocent,"_Coffin and the Paper Man_ is an interesting book in that it deals less with the central aspects of who committed a brutal rape/murder of a young local girl and more with the aftereffects as someone in the community tries to take vengeance into their own hands.Butler is a talented mystery writer, but this is not one of the strongest John Coffin mysteries. It feels a bit like an afterthought and many of the aspects that make Coffin books so good (relationship with Stella, presence of his sister Letty) are missing here."
4,Informative and interesting account of this aspect of WWII,Well told recount of the Dunkirlk evacuation with many individual accounts woven together to give one the whole picture. I recommend if you want to learn more about this historically unique and significant event.
2,Tedious account...even for a Lord fan!,"As a big fan of both A NIGHT TO REMEMBER and DAY OF INFAMY, I was excited to read this one. But even as an enthusiast of WW2 History and this particular author, I found it pretty slow going. Plodding details without the candid, human elemnt Lord generally writes best. I finished the book feeling unenlightened and not particularly better informed about the events @ Dunkirk."
1,Chemicals that might cause birth defects?!?!,"You won't find this on any of the websites. I just received this product, and there is a warning on the label reading: California Proposition 65 requires the following warning for this product: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. This has got to be the only food product that I have ever seen with this warning. You see it at gas stations and stores where they sell lead crystal...but not on food labels. Unfortunately, I opened it already, so I can't return it. Into the trash it goes."
5,Great for kids with autism!,"My autistic child who selectively only eats healthy foods(veggies and brown rice!) and will not eat burgers loves this stuff when blended with almond milk and mixed frozen berries from Walmart! It has ""positively"" affected his eating in only days as I think it is giving him the needed amino acids his body needs! Only one spoonful per mix though! He easily will drink two glasses per day. I finally feel we found a way to get necessary protein in him. This stuff ""only"" has brown rice protein and natural vanilla flavor without the added garbage so it merges nicely with the almond milk and berries!"
5,LOVE this protein powder!,This powder is great. I had a hard time finding a sugar-free brown rice powder now that Jay Robb stopped making his. I add some stevia & a banana to give it sweetness.
4,recipes,I was looking for recipe ideas too. I have added it to Pamela's brownie mix so I can sneak some extra protein into my daughter's diet. I add only a tablespoon. I add a bit more water and/or oil into the mix to account for the extra dry ingredient. Don't add too much or you can taste the powder.
3,Not my favorite.,"While it doesn't taste terrible, the texture is grainy and a little bitter compared to their fermented soy protein. It's ground fine so it mixes easily with anything. Though I bought a whole jar I probably won't be using it unless I'm in pinch for protein because it stops me up a little bit (just like anything else made with rice)."
2,Gritty and Unpleasant,"I have been making protein smoothies for years and have used every type available. I've been trying to stay away from animal-based proteins and thought trying brown rice would be something different.I was not satisfied on any level with this stuff. It did not have a high protein amount per serving and it tasted gritty.I usually make it with soy milk and fruit in a blender. Usually it is delicious, with this protein power, it sucked."
1,"was not aware of product ""warning""","There are some good aspects to this rice powder (see other reviews) but I was not happy after trying it to find the warning lablel ""California Proposition 65 requires the following warning for this product: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm"". I hope this helps buyers make a fully informed decision!"
2,tastes like cardboard,"This might be a healthy shake but it tastes like cardboard, even with rice milk and blueberries added. I suggest you look for something else."
5,This is great!,The product works great and am pleased.The taste takes a little getting use to but Iput in no calorie drink powder and makesit taste great.
4,Goodish book,"When Mr. Callahan is not taking pot-shots at people and concepts he doesn't like(modern ecconomics, left wingers, right wingers and capitalism) the book actually flows very well and manages to impart a good message.Overall-The book raises good points cheating is on the rise in this country, also the fact that a small part of me doesn't care for the grandstanding tactics of Mr. Callahan is probably the point this book is trying to make, everyone is cheating so why shouldn't I.The author may must things bluntly but when you come right down to it these things need to be said simply because no one eles seems to be saying them."
4,Innovative research & sound conclusions,"A telling and innovative book that tackles a difficult ethical issue without pandering. At times a bit high-handed, but the emphasis on the need for ethical behavior in society apart from moral preaching is a practical and relevant argument worthy of the detail it recieves here."
2,was expecting something different,"I was expecting more on ethics and less blatant political rambling. A better title for this book might be ""Capitalism is Evil"".However, the parts of the book that weren't spent advocating socialism did have some good information and theories. So, 2 or 2.5 stars for those parts."
3,"Look at our so-called ""role models""","Look at the so-called ""leader of the free world"", Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld. Can you name any bigger cheats and liers? And the amazing way they get away with it? Blind Americans give them the go-ahead to cheat, lie, and kill in the name of power and money. Damn, after 4 years of nothing but lying to us, they got re-elected! Americans have no one to blame but themselves as we slip into fascism.I've never seen nor heard of any bigger immoral, lying, disgraceful people in this country in my life. They make Nixon look like a moral upstanding citizen. The message to the youth - cheat and lie to get ahead or be left behind.Hail to the cheat!"
3,"Lots of theory, short on research","While David Callahan presents a number of ideas about both cheating behavior and its consequences, his book is rather light on actual research to back up his theories. As I read the book, I kept waiting for him to support his ideas with facts, and in the end was disappointed to find that he never did so.Without facts, this book is little more than a moralistic rant, albeit a well-written one. This book will offer cheaters a salve for their concious (everyone does it, I need to cheat to get ahead, society has enabled me to cheat, etc.) and non-cheaters a number of stories to fuel their righteous anger. If you want to get upset about cheating, it is a good read. If you want to draw a fact-based conclusion about the prevelance and consequences of cheating in modern society, look elsewhere."
1,I was cheated in buying this book,"In the future, I'll take more time to read the reviews. I am embarrassed to have paid even the modest sum I did for this socialist opinion piece. As many of the other reviews noted, this outpouring of garbage emerges from anecdotes not substantiated by even a reasonable attempt at citing valid research.This book title should probably be The Cheating Culture: A Modern Socialist Manifesto. I suggest the author consider moving to Cuba or Venezuela - they seem to be more aligned with his political views. He clearly doesn't fit in a democracy."
1,"If you believe in socialism, you will love this book","There are several reviews by other members who have shown exactly why this book adds little to no value to the conversation about ethics in American culture. In summary, the author attempts manufacture a problem (he admits in the first chapter that little to no good evidence suggests that cheating is in fact on the rise or has risen in the past 50+ years) and then proposes that the only solution to said problem is socialism. He is very blunt about what he believes. If you want to save some time, simply skip to the last chapter and read what his proposed solutions are. Like I said, if you love socialism, you will love this book. If you are seeking a read that actually addresses cheating and what we can do about it, this book is not for you."
1,Not at all on the subject,"The author doesn't demonstrate enough examples of cheating. Rather he's on a tear against making money, the stock market, executive salaries, golf clubs, gated communities, expensive cars, etc.I had hoped for a book that would really look at cheating in America -- from high school test taking to online piracy to corporate scandals.Instead this book is filled with hidden agenda Socialism."
4,Another Live Performance From Paul Rodgers,"Owner of one of the strongest and most recognizeable voices in rock, Paul Rodgers has been a major vocal player since his days with the band Free through his time with Bad Company and later with The Firm and The Law, among others.This is a strong effort and worth the purchase price for fans of Rodgers. I'd rate it a notch below the Live Bad Company disc, ""Merchants of Cool."""
3,Good advice,"Haven't fully brached out, but it helped me to make my first move to spread my wings and fly from the day to day grind."
4,great for starters and intermediate experience,"This is a great bag. The vinyl exterior is the best and most durable. Bought for boyfriend as a b-day gift and he seems to love it. It's great because it's got the double end which can be very useful. This is a good weight for starters as well as intermediate users equally. As long as you're in shape and fairly active but not looking to use this professionally, this should work great. I think most of them don't but I was a little bummed out when I got the bag w/out the cord to hook it at the bottom--the pic/description made it sound like it came with one. Overall very satisfied with the price and the quality as well as Amazon's shipping. Awesome deal (super saving shipping) and I got it within a week. I was extremely pleased."
5,Figs and Fate,"This is a delightful collection of five modern-day short stories from Arab teenagers living in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Iraq. It serves to break down stereotypes while showing that children all over the world have similar dreams, hopes and ambitions. This book would be a good way to teach children tolerance and acceptance for other cultures"
4,Reality of Salvage Work,"A good read, I was glued to the page turner till 1am last night. This book displays the real world of salvage work, the burocracy you have to work against, the pitfalls, the ways wrecks are found, the research needed and where to find it.As for the main story of the Edinburg, it is a classic example of a man too focused to worry about the non-research details. His lack of tax planning, failure to background check his partners, and his gruff demeanor set the story up for a sad ending.Its a real world study of the salvage industry and a great read, but its real life. Don't expect a Dirk Pitt ending with him getting the girl, the gold and the respect of his peers."
4,Simply create,"Dore Ashton befriended Mark Rothko, the famed impressionist painter and she shares her insight into the life of this artist in her book, About Rothko.With some beautiful images, you get a sense of the larger than life work of Rothko. This artist sought to bring out the internal inspiration onto the canvas. To delve into the inner demons we all see and splash them onto his master pieces.This book is a good start to peek into a complex man who pushed the envelope. He could be gregarious and engaging one minute and a recluse the next.Ashton shares her first hand relationship which gives this book a colorful peek into an artist's life."
1,The worst book about Rothko?,"Out of two hundred plus pages here you will find a grand total of maybe two pages' worth of remarks that strike you by their precision, sensitivity, and depth of understanding of the work - that is until you realize that these are without exception quotes from the artist himself. Ashton herself seems to have nothing to say ""about Rothko"". Desperate to write a ""big"" and ""important"" book, she offers empty hyperbole in place of thoughtful analysis, coated in such convoluted, meaningless, and purely academic lingo that by page five reading the book becomes a painful chore not unlike having to clean the underside of a sanitation truck with a toothbrush. Frankly, I don't see how a manual on transmission repair could offer fewer insights into Rothko's painting."
3,I thought it was about something else!,"Seriously I did. The first time I saw a Rothko painting was at the SFMoMA. It covered an entire wall of the room and was the biggest thing on canvas I have ever seen. I was hoping that Dore Ashton's book would give me an insight into the meaning and style of Rothko, but rather, it seemed to be a biography of the man rather than a critism of the work. I suppose that's partially my fault since I'm sure there quite a bit of art critism books out there on Rothko...unfortunately, the historical presentation of the book isn't really all that interesting. I guess in the end, the big picture is that Rothko was deeply influenced by his Marxist experiences because that's what I got from Ashton's book. On a side note, Dore Ashton writes for Modern Painter magazine, which is actually a good magazine."
3,Pretty Basic,"If you are new to buying and selling, this is a well written book that covers many things and will help you. However, if you are eBay experienced and looking for new or little known information, there isn't much to be had."
2,Too many mistakes!,"I would have given this book a star or two more, but the author does not respond to e-mails about text errors. The book's website (with corrections and reader questions/answers listed) hasn't been updated in months! I know that it's almost impossible to keep mistakes out of technical writings, but update your site and respond to readers questions!"
2,The eBook digital version is a ripoff!,"Although the original idea behind providing the book as a PDF was admirable, the publisher does not allow the digital file to be edited. I can understand setting the security feature for printing due to copyrights, but for those of us that have made the investment into the Full version of Acrobat and use the commenting features extensively, the security settings do not allow the saving of comments made to the file (highlighting, underlining and comment boxes) while reading the file. This pretty much makes the file useless. Complaints to Amazon, Adobe and the publisher have resulted in a lot of heinous finger pointing as to who controls the security settings. This is a real shame, since the content of the book is very good. One can only hope that the publisher enrolls in an Acrobat course. Oh wait...the training materials will be in PDF, won't they..."
2,Unclear in some important areas,"I agree with a spotlight post that said the author skimmed over difficult areas and spent too much time on easy areas. I am a beginner but have some experience in JavaScript and VB, but I found myself ready to throw this book out the window and burn it at times. How to use boolean operators are not explained, threaded programs are not given enough detail, and the best part of the language, applets, are hardly mentioned throughout the book! I don't recommend this book to others."
3,"Funny, but confusing after Hour 9","I found the book to be written in a very humourous manner, and enjoyed the tone. It made learning Java 2 fun. However, the content of the book got a bit confusing after Hour 9, when it moved into the object-orientated progamming section. The concepts were rushed, and not clearly explained. The book is good for giving a new programmer the correct skills to get started, but loses the plot from Chapter 10 onwards."
2,Did not get me very far,"I went through all the exercises and in the end I do not really feel that I am all that knowledgeable about Java. The concepts were really not explianed fully - the WHY was not elaborated on. This is at best a cursory look at Java and perhaps a good beginning, but you will need a lot more to really be able to program with any skill. I don't think I can even put that I know Java on my resume after going through this."
3,"A book where ""beginner"" means ""beginner""","I'm new to this game, so ""beginners'"" books which assume familiarity with programming are a bit disappointing. This slimmish volume left me looking for much more, before I realised that I had actually learnt something about programming. I would have liked a bit (a lot) more attention to general principals, but found it a helpful springboard for this beginner."
2,Not good for experienced programmers...,"I just recently got my BSCS, and bought this book looking to get into Java. Having bought a good SAMS C book a few years back, I was expecting a decent tool to help me learn and be an alright reference for later. What I got was a book mostly devoted to teaching the reader how to program rather than teaching the Java language.Okay, I can settle for skipping past the first half of the book, since with most computer books thats the way it goes. Unfortunately, the second half wasn't much better. I.E the Swing GUI section was basically a ""type this and see what happens"" section. I was extremely disappointed that the book provided no exposure to standard I/O.So if you're a beginner with aspirations to become a programmer and you want to start out with Java, this book might work for you. But everyone else, I recommend finding something better to do with your time."
1,Poorly organized,"Like many computer books, this one is not very good. The sections on OOP are vague, and the habit of pasting lines of code in the text rather than using more complet code only makes the learning curve steeper for those learning java. In addition, many of the examples in the book have errors. Overall, this book misses the mark."
3,Java in 24 hours,"Not a bad book.I would recommend it to beginners, but it is a very slow process of learning, unlike the other books I've read. After all, it is for beginners!If you do read this book, don't worry if you don't understand it, you will as you read on."
1,"A Hard to understand, usless book, do not buy this book!","I am taking a corse to learn java, and let me tell you this, this book is NOT helpfull at all. It's code is outdated, most of the time the code you write will not run, and it's ""examples"" often take the hard way to get something done. Most of my time with this book is spent trying to figure out a way to get their code to work, if you want my review, skip this book, get the web version of teach yourself java 1.1, it's free."
2,before hour10 is ok...,"This book is ok from hour 1 to 9, but as soon as i go to hour 10, something is getting me confused. I have only read up to 12, so i don't know how it will be after 12...."
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"You have enough choices to get a better book than this one. I am shameful for my own selection. However, this book may be suitable for some others who like this style."
4,A good book to begin learning Java 2,"This book is a solid learning tool. I have to agree with the reviewer that said the book does get tough after chapter 9. The vast majority of the code I've tried works. This book does a good job of getting you up to speed on Java. I would suggest using this book as a starting point and going else where to get really indepth information. As far as getting a clue about Java, this book is definite buy."
2,I wouldn't buy it.,"I bought the 502c 75 pounder four years ago, and it lasted me mere months. After a short time my fists were punching holes in it, and it eventually ripped in half. Unless the material has changed, it won't hold up to the abuse it logically should be able to withstand. To be fair, I throw hard punches, and no bag lasts me too long. On the bright side, I contacted TKO, and they picked up my bag, and sent me a new, better one at no cost. TKO stands behind their products."
3,Good Book. Wrong Political Views.,"I frequently agree with Rall, and I'll certainly give him credit for being both a very good writer and excellent cartoonist. He voices a distinct viewpoint and adds an important element to the national political dialogue.That said, he's really really far to the left, more so than anyone in the mainstream Democratic party. He's more of a Noam Chomsky acolyte than anything else. He believes the invasion of Afghanistan after 9-11 was wrong. He was dismissive of the death of Pat Tilman. He's just very negative - not hopeless, because he's still engaged in politics, but relentlessy critical, adding much fire and less light.There's a point in organized dissent where people become so enraged that their feet come off the ground. Ted Rall is frequently right on the edge."
2,Points on Target; Ranting is Unproductive.,"Having enjoyed Rall's editorials, I anxiously awaited this book to arrive. Perhaps that's why I was so disappointed by its advice. Rall advocates fighting dirty like the Republicans and others on the far right do. It was a humorless diatribe as much against Democrats for their complacency and incompetence in the political arena as against the Bush & Company administration. Rather than being energized I was offended; maybe I'm not liberal enough."
3,Unbelievable,"It's hard to understand how anyone can have their head buried so far up their rear end that they could actually buy in to this. And at the same time it's easy to see why liberals cannot win an election. I would advise everyone to read this book. I would also advise everyone to read ""The Law"" by Frederic Bastiat when you're done for a real economic lesson about where our country is headed if we remain on this Socialistic track. ""The Law"" is about 30 pages long and can be read for free on the internet. It is absolute poison for the liberal mind (I know, I know... that is an oxymoron)."
1,Ted Rall is a Loser,"This book should be retitled ""Wake up, Ted, You're an Idiot.""Ted Rall is a nasty little jerk. This is the same lowbrow moron who wrote such vile and malicious personal vitriol against President Reagan after his death and calls Republicans ""neofascists"" and worse. Ted can't debate legitimate issues - so he resorts to rants and personal insults. He's a real class act.This book, like Ted Rall himself, is worthless. I was given it as a joke and promptly threw it out. Save your money."
5,Opened my eyes,"Ted Rall should be commended for laying out all the cards on the table and calling out what needs to be fixed. He is spot on in his current views of the Democratic Party and what they need to do to get the blood flowing again. He is absolutely correct in that the majority of Americans hold different shades of liberal views and that the conservative movement has been against progress from the very beginning. But why do they win election after election? Because they are successful in media control, voter manipulation and lying. This country is headed for the toilet and people need to wake up."
4,Deep Dish Pizza Pan,"Delivery of this Pizza Pan was quick and came in good shape. The pan is easy to wash, the finish is great and the pan is nice and round and deep, great for a pan pizza with the works. We found one sharp area about an inch long under one rolled edge of the lip. It was a piece of metal that must of gotton caught when the lip was rolled. My husband got some pliers and pulled it out and now the pan is fine. I would recommend this pan for the pizza lovers out there!"
4,Pizza Pan,I've been trying to find a deep dish pizza pan for my son since he moved from the Chicago area. They are really hard to find! He was wild about this one when he opened it up on Christmas morning!
5,Awesome,"This is probably the most important piece of kitchen equipment that you need to make genuine Chicago deep dish pizza. As a misplaced Chicagoan living in the South, good pizza is hard to come by, much less a deep dish pie. So, if you need to make your own, this is the bomb!"
5,Midsummer Moon,"What can I say-Al Petteway has done it again. He has created a CD of calming yet upbeat music. From the 'sweet' ""Wild Mountain Thyme,"" to the beautiful melodies of ""Chase the Moon"" to the 'haunting' ""Phooka"" to the upbeat reel of ""Wintertide"" this CD is not one you want to miss out on!"
4,Enjoyable read,"If I was old enough to remember Tab, I would probably like this more, but I enjoyed it quite a bit anyway. Also did a good job explaining how being gay was taboo, Tab didn;t seem to quite understand it himself."
4,Surprisingly Well Done,"Tab Hunter was before my time, yet I had the desire to read this book. I found it easy reading, very inciteful and hard to put down. I was never a fan of this actor but have come to appreciate him. I must say that the profanity in this book was not necessary and Hunter does, in my opinion, come off as somehow and somewhat arrogant--just my impression. But as for the book, it is well written and interesting and I do recommend it. See if you can borrow it from someone or get it at the library as it is not of the keeper variety."
1,Gay? Can't Prove It By Me!,"If he says he's gay, I guess we have to believe it. But from the disinterested way he describes his relationships with men even while he fawns over beautiful women he met and co-starred with during his movie career, he sure ain't writin' no gay pride manifesto here. He wants us to know that he was ""totally intimate"" with French starlet Etchika Choreau, but you're left wondering if he even ever kissed his boyfriends! He decries ""macho bulls**t,"" but there's definitely some of that particular substance to be found within these pages. Between the lines, you get the impression of a spoiled little boy who throws temper tantrums, and more than a hint of a big Hollywood ego. Try as I might, I couldn't feel sympathetic toward Tab Hunter . . . particularly not after I read of his opposition to gay people getting married. He's no different, in my opinion, than your average, garden variety, Red State conservative homophobe. Thumbs down!"
5,"Honest, straight foreward biography","I have to agree with most of the reviews here on AMAZON, this has to be one of the most honest and revealing biographies of a Hollywood star ever. I didnt know too much about fabulous Tab until reading about him in the book on Henry Wilson. Well he was certainly gorgeous.. surely one of the most beautiful men around during the late 50's and 60's...but...he was more than just looks, and underneath that nordic God exterior is a man of depth and intelligence. Tab writes about his rise in Hollywood, the highs and the lows, as well as his struggle with his sexual identity and is quite revealing about some of his relationships. Its straight forward, not pretentious at all and very readable."
5,tab hunter confidential,"I found this book very honest and informative of the times - a nice ride down memory lane. He's a ""hunk""."
5,A vivid memoir which reveals a multi-faceted actor's life,"Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making Of A Movie Star provides an candid, informative, and intensely personal autobiography by one of Hollywood's biggest names: and here Tab speaks out for the first time about what it was like to be a movie star around 1950, when he was first 'discovered' by an agent. His Hollywood acting experiences, his confusion about being gay and trapped in a romantic image for females, and his dealings with Hollywood's politics and seedier side makes for a vivid memoir which reveals a multi-faceted actor's life."
5,Very enjoyable! Couldn't put it down!,"This is undoubtedly one of the best books that I've read in a long time. Tab pulls no punches and tells it like it is. I especially enjoyed the name dropping. If you grew up in the 50s like I did you will probably get a lot more out of this book because otherwise many of the names won't ring a bell.Tab was never a particularly good actor or a singer but he had a look that served him well. I found the ""making of an idol"" part fascinating as well as the inevitable decline when the phone just doesn't ring as much as it did before. Highly recommended!!"
5,oustanding,"This book was a real pleasure to read. Not only does it show you how exhausting it is living as a celebrity, it also proofs how difficult it was living as a gay artist in the 50's, or better it still is nowadays."
2,Superficial and unenlightening.,"400 pages of ""I did this crappy movie"" and ""Then I did this crappy movie"" interspersed with vague, arm's-length recollections of various non-relationship, pseudo-relationship and what-relationship? tales of yore. Not particularly forth-coming and lacking insight."
4,a work of Art.,"This book was recommended to me and I must say I enjoyed it very much.The incidents with bad press throughout his career were interesting to read about. Writing any kind of biography leaves you vulnerable to having your character judged. I for one choose not to judge the man's choices and character. All-in-all, I put the book down liking Tab. It's well written and I thought the man's journey has been extraordinary. I'm glad he shared it with us."
4,Tab Hunter was my teenaged crush,"I liked his looks and eventually married a man who is fair and fine. We knew Hunter was gay, what did it matter, I was never going to sleep with him anyway. I bought his single 'Young Love' and listened to it often alone in my small room on the upper East Side of Manhattan. Now I am happy to know that buying that record, those magazines, tickets to those movies contributed to the success of a worthy individual. I don' t remember being aware of his German heritage, but reading his story delighted and impressed me. He gets up early every day and puts in an effort. I am glad to become acquainted with the man behind the movie hero all these years later. I used to be familiar with so many of those names, ahh. It brings me back, but I sure would not want to GO back. Well done."
4,Competent and absorbing,"The actor offers a frank, clear-eyed assessment of growing up without a father, then of the packaging and manipulation that, for years, Hollywood imposed. The fact that Hunter remained in the closet humorously complicated the Hollywood packaging. The strength of this biography is the patient accumulation of wry observation that shows Tab Hunter maturing as a man and an artist. His account is, however, highly reticent in its descriptions of liaisons with men such as Anthony Perkins. The writing, though always absorbing, is marred by a heavy reliance on cliches. Still, the Tab Hunter who emerges from these pages is sensitive and vulnerable, yet strong and admirable. I want to go and view his early films. Recommended."
4,Very pleased.,"I liked it. However, I must admit that I found Montgomery Clift's biography to be more riviting. Still a good read."
1,Not Good,If I could give it zero stars I would...This CD is bad...It sounds like every other piece of garbage out their...And boring....Their new EP sounds like every other corporate rock band...Remain UNAMED..Please....They claim to be different on their site but they're anything but different...There the same as every Corporate rock band...Boring.. and their fans don't know any better
1,...,this cd isnt different from anything out there. its very irritating and...just flat out bad. shean cox is [bad] ....
3,Free CDs are always the best!,"I enjoy Unamed, particularly because they gave me not one, but two free CDs! My friend Bobby stole one and is also the reason the drummer from Unamed (Lou) still is bitter about being removed from our old band. I'm such a good person, I don't even hold against them that some of them are sell outs and have day jobs! TEACHERS? UGH! Haha! Just kidding guys! I enjoy your goods and I dig the last song on the new EP - just get that balls to the wall studio/produced sound on your upcoming CDs and we'll tour and rock the world! Oh, by the way, NJ mostly sucks for music because it is a sess pool of lame cover bands! See Unamed for the reason they are original alone!"
3,It's ok,"These guys are talented, but they don't have a unique sound. They sound like a lot of other bands out there."
4,Handy item,"You can re-purpose an existing printer cable with a USB B connecter, and use it as an extension with this adapter, for instance to lengthen a PS 3 controller's short charge cord."
2,Worthless,I found this to be worthless. It works well but I learned after buying this that USB cords will not transmit signal after they get so long and when you have something like this it interrupts even more. I was going to use this for my printer and had 2 6' cables. Used this and made it 12'. My printer did not work. When I connected 1 cable it worked. Had a computer person come check it out and he told me that USB will not work on long distances like that. That is why it is hard to find a USB cable longer than 6'. So with that being true that pretty much makes this thing worthless. It does work good though as far as makes good connection and is built well.
3,Not for use with dogs!,"The first day we received our new potty my daughter actually used it. So, we were thrilled when our daughter peed in it after only 1 hour of having it setup. However, a couple of hours later we heard a banging noise in our bathroom where we had the potty setup and found our dog had stuck his head in through the hole and got stuck with the plastic bag over his head. Luckily, we were able to calm the dog (and my daughter) and get the bag and potty off of his head. Had we not been around things could have been much worse, but now we know we have to keep the potty out of reach from the dogs."
5,A road trip necessity,We've taken 3 young children on two driving vacations across the desolate southwest. This has saved us MANY a wet seat. I still keep it in the car for the occasional around town stop. A good size.
4,Very satisfied,"I love this product! It goes with us everywhere and is extremely handy to use. It is very portable and the size is not too much of an inconvenience. The only problem we had with it is that our son is a little too short to sit on it without his little boy parts scraping on the pee-guard, but this will be remedied with time. We do not have any problems with the opening being too small. I would recommend this to a friend."
4,Highly recommend,"We loved this so much that we went out and bought another. We keep one in the car for emergencies/convenience and another in my daughter's room. When we first potty trained, I would keep it with me when we get out and just used the carrying case like you would a diaper bag putting my keys, money, and smaller objects in the outer zipper area. While it doesnt fold down small enough to fit in the basket of a stroller, the bag does have an adjustable strap that easily fits over all four of my stroller handles (BOB, sit and stand, prego AND mini jogger). We have travelled with it for air travel and i just brought it as carry on. You don't need the bags it comes with or the absorbing thingys. We just use a regular 4 gallon trash bag. It is sturdy enough to even allow an adult to use it. LOVE IT. I can't think of one complaint."
5,Definately a MUST for all those who care what they eat !,The author has captured a rather unique aspect of Healthy Culinary Cuisine. This should be required reading to fully enjoy the splendors of the Kitchen !
2,"Can get unpleasant, trust me.","This is not the best Requiem out there. For anyone not getting it just for its historical value, it should be kept in mind that the sound quality is rather poor. The ""Dies irae"" overture's grainy overload clipping distortion is horrible. If that annoys you, you better look for your Verdi elsewhere and skip Giulini's, if not, performances are worth checking out. Personally, I seldom touch this CD."
5,Great Natural Tan!,"This by far is the best ""tan in a bottle"" I have ever used, it provides a natural color and goes on evenly, without those orangy looking feet areas. I tried to remember where I got it, but had no success finding it so I got it here. Please try this, you will be pleased with the results :)"
3,Very nice!! Well I thought it was,"I really like Vaseline healthy body glow. I am really pale, people ask if I am sick all the time. But using this I am tan in no time. It does have a scent but not too strong. Over all I would say if you are looking to use a lotion for your tan, this would be a great choice. I am sure I will buy again.Updatewell after useing this for a while I did find one really big flaw. I wear hairbands on my wrist since I like to always have one on hand. Mine was wet and it rubbed the color right off. My one wrist looked very strange since it was a stripe of very pail white instead of nice and tan like the rest of me. So if you have anything that will rub your skin alot I would say this is not the way to go or you might just look a little silly like me."
3,Smaller than expected,"The product is great, The advertising was bad. It looked as if more came with the earrings than actually did."
2,wow...three guitarists...so?,"I don't hate this album, but I really don't like it...(...)I mean...except being heavy, they don't bring something new to the scene....Three guitarist+generic hardcore = predictible music and...nothing new...The funniest thing is the publicity they get with this aspect of the lineup ""OMG, three guitars! they're probably soooo brutal"" or ""this three guitar band is going to change your perception of the hardcore scene"" and blahblah...A big deception compared to their previous work...2 stars because i'm feeling great today..."
1,Trite,I am two thirds through this book of sterotyped characters and have decided to not continue. It is poorly written. All the white characters are studpid or evil and the black ones loving but unable to live under the oppression of those whites to whome they belong.It is not realistic or interesting.
2,"Choreography, but not much instruction","This video is like watching auditions for a dance troupe or show. The leader shows you what choreography they want to see, runs through it a couple of times, and then, hey presto, you then replicate the steps they want to see. The problem is, there is a basic assumption that you already know HOW to do the steps. Fine if you are an experienced dancer that already knows the ""how"" and just needs to know what order they are to be presented in. If, however, you are not experienced enough to know how to do them, or perhaps just don't pick up on and memorize what to do in four quick run thoughs, then this is not for you. My point is that you won't learn how to do anything from this video, just how to put together combinations based on things that the video assumes you already know. On the cover, however, it states it has ""easy to follow instruction"" and is for ""beginning students to seasoned professionals"", which just seems a bit misleading to me."
3,For fast learners,"I enjoyed this DVD because she repeats the exercise quite a bit, but I have to admit that I am a fast learner with everything, and I know quite a few people who would get frustrated with this and leave it. I, myself found it easy to follow, the only downside being that she doesn't want you to mirror what she's doing. She's talking to you as if you are a student of hers, or part of her troupe (IE - as if you are behind her, following her lead, instead of in front of her trying to mirror it) so that was a little confusing to me, so I didn't like that I had to do more thinking and do that opposite of what I was told.Overall, I enjoyed a decent low impact workout. I want to get another video of hers, and probably will buy the guide to your souldmate (I think that's the name). But again, if you have not taken dance classes before or if you are not a fast learner with mimicking people, then I'd say this video isn't for you."
4,A Turn to Literary History,"Like any collection, there are highs and lows, but there are a few poems that would rank among Heaney's best in this collection. Moreso than his other collections, this one seems heavily weighted with the literary past. Heaney has always been interested in Irish history, but in this collection, he changes his focus to literary history and the immediate poetic past. In the last section of the book, 5 of the 9 poems are explicitly addressed to poets of Heaney's generation who have passed away. In that sense, the book is a bit pensive in tone, but it is enlivened by anecdote and word play. For Heaney fans, I recommend it, but if you are new to his work, you'd be better off with one of his Selected Works (I think he's published 3), or an early to mid-career book."
1,What IS THIS!?,"Not a trace of anything that's made GG what he is today. Just an early album worth passing by. Get FFDJ instead, for the REAL GG experience!"
5,"Saint GG, full of piss","New Hamshire's favorite son. Makes me proud to have come from there. Too bad his musical output went to hell so quickly after his first couple albums. He took himself too seriously, and thought he had to walk the walk, even if it meant plodding stupidly down into hell. But at his early peak, he was sublimely, beautifully obscene."
3,If you want all of The Jabbers Years This Ain't it!,This CD is a curious one. When this CD release first came out it was at the wrong recording speed (very rare)that sounded like The Chipmunks. All the material on this CD along with all the Jabber years of GG Allin are available from Black and Blue Records. The title is Banned In Boston which was released long before this CD and was also released on Vinyl back in the day. Banned in Boston has all of this material plus the singles from the Jabber years. Do yourself a favor and buy the Black and Blue CDs. Why pay the same $$ and get less. Now if you want the photos used in this packaging thats a reason to buy it or if you are a completist you'll need both.
4,Great stuff,"This is the rubbermaid set to get and to continue to buy over time. The stuff is indestructable and while I preferred the stain saver line, this is truly an excellent product. The lids do snap together for space saving, and since the pieces stack, the entire set takes up very little room. Freezes well, defrosts well...all around, and excellent, no stain product. Highly recommended!"
1,BEWARE - IT IS NOT WHAT IS PICTURED!!!,"Beware - they send you the OLD, NOT BPA free model! The new, BPA free model has red covers, just as on the picture, and the swirls on the sides of the containers. They sent instead the plain older model, no swirls, navy-blue covers. Do not care about the swirls, but the reason I'm getting new containers is to replace the old ones with these BPA free. Returned for replacement (And commented as to why!) - they sent me AGAIN the old model!!! Arranged with Amazon for a refund now (originally it eligible for replacement only). One more trip to the post office... And, btw, the shipping was almost the cost of the item itself - would be better off just buying containers one by one in the supermarket, at least I'd see what they are."
3,Great except they don't seal liquids,"Like the stackability, and lids lock into each other. The deal killer is that they do not seal in liquids. I bought the more expensive rubbermaid to use camping and picnicing and found that if it tipped, any liquid would leak out. Never used in microwave or freezer and were hand washed most of the time, so that wasn't the problem.Rubbermaid FG7J11TRCHILI 12-Piece New Premier Food Storage Container Set"
4,Well writen. Can't say enough about it.,"I was a GREAT book. The author made a few errors in conjuncion with Wicca, but otherwise it was great. I was interested in Wicca for years but fogot about it. This book reminded me of how I used to feel when I performed a spell. I made my friend read it they loved it to!"
4,Very enjoyable light read,"I enjoyed this book very much. The story is enjoyable and the characters engaging. If you look past the fact that there are inaccuracies about Wicca in there (it is actually a new religion based on older religions, not an acient religion itself) you can really get into it.So far I've read the first four books in the series. It is pretty easy to predict what is going to happen but the writer still makes it worthwhile to continue reading to see if you are right."
4,Very Engrossing,"Morgan, the average teenage wallflower, average looks, no bust and very shy. That is until Cal Blaire shows up, Cal is good looking charming and every girl wants to get close to him. Cal introduces Morgan into a world of wicca and Magick. Morgan's crush on Cal causes a rift between her and her best friend Bree. Will things ever be the same?A real page turner, definitely worth reading for anyone who's into wicca and the supernatural."
1,book of shadow,was not what I wont but it ok so sorry so sorry what can I say it miss lending so sorry
1,"Book of Shadows (Sweep, No. 1) by Tiernan","I usually don't write negative reviews but in this case I making an exception because this book irritated me to no end. I am an avid fantasy reader and I read tons of books which have magical and Wicca characters. However, this book does not read like a fantasy novel. Instead of being action and adventure packed fantasy it reads like a religious propoganda. There is no action in the book, the characters are not well developed, and their melodramatic relationships seem only as a background to a lengthy description of what Wicca is. The whole book is dedicated to one of the main characters drafting people into his religion.It almost felt as if these kids were in some creepy cult. I have nothing against Wicca and would write the same review if the characters were praying to Jesus or any other deity. This is not a fantasy book and should not be labeled as such."
3,Textbook story,"Morgan is not typically beautiful, but she gets a really cute guy-witch Cal as a boyfriend. Morgan and Cal are in a tough spot where Morgan must defend Cal against another witch. Morgan's not sure if she's killed the other witch or not, but she's in constant anxiety about it. Also, she's getting mixed messages from Cal and his mother, and she's not sure what her feelings are telling her.I think that there are better witchy books available. Try 'Dark Sister' and 'Practical Magic.'"
5,Teen Mom Loved this Series!,"As a mom of a 14 year old, I like to know what she is reading -- but I've found that I enjoy the books she reads as much as I enjoy my own books -- ESP. this series!Of all of the romance horror/si-fi books I've read, this is the most riviting. It kept me wanting to go to the next book!My daughter and I had a great time discussing it and laughing at each other as we learned something new from the plot!You know a series is good when you wished the author would write more!! And although the last book rapped up the story to a neat little ending, I cannot help but wish there'd been a few more to read."
5,Addicting!,"I first came across this book at B&N; but didnt have time to flip through it so I decided to Amazon it later. Well, I did and I ended up picking it up.This book completely hooked me. I was curious to know who Cal was and what his intentions were. And I was curious to know how Morgan and Bree's friendship would turn out. I read this about a week before Halloween, so it was nice to know what the Wiccan ritual for Halloween was considering I'm very into Wicca. I didnt have any trouble relating to Morgan since I was pretty much in the same situation she was in. My mom is completely against me reading about Wicca and my best friend was well, being similar to Bree at the time.I'm excited that this series has plenty more books in it and I'm excited to get started on reading the rest of them!"
5,Surprisingly Good,"I picked this book up a couple of days ago with moderate expectations. I knew the general premise which seemed quite interesting, but I was also aware of how thin and unrealistic most of the characters and plots in these types of books are (teen geared series). It only took a couple of chapters to become engrossed in the story and with the well developed characters. The only thing I found lacking was the length of the book, but there are many more (I went and got all of them from my library) so that wasn't much of a problem. Wicca isn't shown entirely realistically in this, but most of the basics are correct."
4,Better than Circle of Three,"I picked up the first several books in this series (don't understand the name yet) and was pleasantly surprised.Morgan is the main character and things get started when the new boy arrives in school (Cal Blaire, get used to the names, there seem to be a lot of 'witch' names Morgan, Blaire, Warren, etc.).Cal is a follower of Wicca and tries to get a bunch of the seniors and juniors involved (although it seems like he might be looking specifically for Morgan).A group is formed and Morgan has to deal with old friends, new friends, catholic parents and upbringing, nudity, her younger sister and possible feelings for Cal.The story goes from the just before the Summer Solstice through Halloween (although I had a hard time believing that much time passed, shouldn't seniors now be going to college?).Other than the time scheme (where did the Summer go?), it is a well crafted story and one can believe Morgan's reactions to events. Am looking forward to the rest of the series."
5,INCREDIBLE!!!,This book was completely realistic and beautifully written. The situations the main character is faced with are believable and the book is just plain good. I reccomend it highly!
4,Good book.,"The book was good. Pulled you in quickly. Kinda short though. Would recommend buying her series in the bigger books. Books mainly come three books in one. Book was shipped quickly, received within 5 days."
4,A good four hour read,This book takes witchcraft more seriously than the usual paranormal/fantasy reads by exploring Wicca proper. The author skillfully builds character conflict in a way that an adult can also appreciate.
5,Wicca,"Morgan and Bree have been best friends for life...until Cal and Wicca come into the scene. Morgan discovers that she has a talent for witchcraft...she may be the most talented of her Wicca coven. Meanwhile, Cal and Morgan are drawn to each other. Morgans life is about to change forever...but is it good or bad? What will change and what will stay the same?"
2,What a disappointment!,"I did not care for this entire series. It starts off promising but leads the reader into areas that are so off-the-wall that even one who accepts 'weird' happenings ends up asking themself ""What was this author thinking?"" It is obvious that the author has little (if any) real knowledge of Wicca and what it truly entails. I would definately NOT recommend this book or any book in this series to anyone looking for real information. If you are only looking for mindless tripe, then you might enjoy this trip into fantasyland."
5,Marine Corp Cadence,"Nice CD, I'll use it when I'm running for that extra motivation I need. It's been a while since I ran with the USMC!"
2,"If you think this CD sounds like ""The Unit"" theme songs....","I purchased this CD because I liked the theme songs from the tv series ""The Unit"" (by Robert Duncan). They were very upbeat with great background music/tunes to keep you going and going and going.Well, I was wrong. The songs included in this CD are, in my personal opinion, not as upbeat or rythmic as the songs you hear from the ""The Unit"". They are relatively dry and did not suit my taste, but might be fine for other people. If you like the songs from The Unit, then you will not like this CD."
3,Classic routines from Jimmy Durante,"For Esther Williams fans, there's not much water ballet in this movie, but Jimmy Durante steals the show. His signature songs, ""You got to start off each day with a song"" and ""I know darn well I can do without Broadway, but can Broadway do without me"" is a must for any Durante fan."
1,Read before you buy,"Well, I had seen reviews of this game. It seemed like a good game, so I ordered it and guess what? It wouldn't run on my computer. The basic system requirements for fly2k are: Windows 95/98/NT 4.0, 350 MB of hard disk and a Pentium 200MHz machine. I have a 360 MHz machine with plenty of disk space and it simply wouln't run. Oh, and don't get me started on the installation process. I had to start over four times. My advice is if you're looking for a good flight simulator, stick with flight simulator 98. you'll get what you're lookinf for (at least for it's price). Don't waste your time and money on fly2k."
2,Disappointing,"As a user of MS FS 2000, I was looking for a more realistic simulation of the Cessna 172. I am rather disappointed. The environment graphics looks very poor compared to MS FS. Yes, there are a few more knobs to turn in the cockpit, but the scrolling you need to find them is ackward. Definitely not my choice."
3,Nothing special at this price,"Matrix products are generally reliable. This one, like all other Matrix products I've tried, pretty much does the job on my limp, super-fine waves. However, so does a Garnier Fructis volumizing spray I've purchased for less than a third of the price. The choice is yours, but I'm going with the cheaper option."
1,"Actually, Not what the description said it was","This product was listed incorrectly. The description was for the 31 track film score by Jay Ferguson which I wanted, but what I got was a 10 track general soundtrack."
2,Disappointing,As a new RV owner I wanted vehicle information and travel tips.Found naritive to be very repetious.
4,Duh,I don't care what the subject there is a Dummies book to cover it and RV'ing is no different. Having been a camper for many years I was not really bowled over by the information offered but if this is something new to you then by all means read this book. A lot of what I already know about camping I had to learn the hard way and this book could have saved me those difficult lessons.
3,our 1st book obut rv'-ing,kan forhbentlig hjlpe os p vores 1. tur i USA til maj 2012. Vi glder os til pick up i Chicago!
2,late for the dance,I bought this for a friend who just bought a RV and wanted to give it as a gift. the other 3 books I bought at the same time came it a timely manor but this one missed the bout as it were. Now what to do with it? maybe a Christmas joke gift.
3,Not exactly what I hoped for,I received the book quickly. It did have some information I found helpful but didn't go into enough detail. I will keep looking for something with more information.
1,Hmmm...It isn't a horrible book but...,"I dunno, maybe I expected more. It is a nice book...if you're a complete dummy. I shouldn't complain when it's full of fluff mostly.It only cost $11.50 on Amazon so I shouldn't really complain. But I feel I should warn you not to expect much. It's not a bad book really just kinda not too much information. I mean, do you really need to be reminded to take money and credit cards with you? I dunno-maybe it's just me."
4,Flicka 3 Country Pride,"I am twelve and love horses. I love the Flicka movies! I would say the first and second are still better, but the third movie is great! Amazon is a little more expensive. We found ours at Wallmart for $12.99. The story was confusing to me before we watched it because of the little summary on the back of the case. The story is about Toby(Clint Black) and his side of the series. This movie is rated G and is a great family fun video. Flicka is not the main star though, which disappointed me. It was mainly focused on Kelly and her life. They ride English which was a fun twist. This time the story is not on a ranch, but instead a riding stable. The acting was excellent as usual. I did find some scenes confusing because they happened so fast. I rewinded it but still couldn't get a good view of the action. It is an hour and a half, and is completely clean. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves horses and knows alot about the Flicka movies!"
5,Loved!,"We now own all three Flicka movies and right now, this third is a strong contender for my favorite (along with first Flicka). Of the three, I found this to be the most uplifting. Scenery, as always, gorgeous. My 8 year old daughter loves them all, of course. We watched this first through Redbox. Ended up watching it 3 times before taking it back. I think I love it as much as my daughter. Hard to find except on Amazon and now I'm looking forward to watching it many more times.I would say if you love horse movies--or has a child who does--this is a great choice!"
1,will not load,i have tryed to buy this like 5 times but it will not let me it is really pissing me off
3,Solid Book for a Statistical View of Software Processes,"I found this book to be well-organized, with solid information for using statistical approaches within software processes. Complete coverage is provided on various control charts, and how create these and how to interpret these.The reason I don't rank the book higher is (1) the authors should spend more time discussing 'organizing' your data for statistical analysis, and (2) the book is relatively short, and could use more information on a set of best practices for the software industry.Although the book does not assume readers know SPC, it certainly would help. Basic statistical knowledge is beneficial to understand and apply the material to the workplace."
2,Hokey,"This is the second review I've done on this particular hypnotist with the same criticism. He's way over the top on his delivery. His dramatic tone mixed with reverberation is too distracting to relax. Maybe that will work for you, but it didn't for me and I couldn't in good conscience recommend this CD."
2,"'Meh...""","""Meh..."" it's ok - a bit sappy (the whole ""sonic love"" thing was WAY over the top for me). It does what it claims it will - put you in a state of hypnosis, however three quarters of the 30 minute CD are spent on getting you to that state (with this 'touchy-feely' delivery that's distracting beyond words). The last ten minutes are the 'memory-improvement' portion (and that's the part that needs improvement!)"
2,I didn't not find this effective,I gave it a try for a period of time and did not find it effective..but that's just me. Maybe it will work for others
1,Bad Construction,Bag came apart too easily and the stuff came out. It looked good in the pictures because burlap always interests the cats.
3,Bewildered,"I plugged this unit into my PC as in the directions and tried several times, but it couldn't find it. I also tried plugging it into my router and it still couldn't find it as one other person had success with. While plugged into the back of the router is the only time the 'g' light shines. I also tried the online utility and I tried entering ""admin"" as instructed several times and it went nowhere?So I thought what the heck, I'll just plug it into the Xbox and see if it works. The 'g' light won't light even though it's only about 7 feet away, however, it seems to work on some level. I played Project Gothem racing and Mechassault with no problems. According to the ""ScreenSavers"", you don't need 'G' speed anyway to run this stuff. My complaint is these directions and utilities seem to be useless and I followed the directions to a tee!"
4,Great for DVR's Too,I have a DVR from DirecTV and this is great for getting the Internet Connection needed for Video On Demand and also for assisting in sharing Media (movies and Music) to stream throughout the house.I have a baby and this helps reduce the need for a cable to be run across the room to get an internet connection to the DVR. Which can be dangerous.The only downside to using this has nothing to do with the unit but the wireless network in my house which seems to drop on the DVR from time to time.I definitely recommend this if your wanting it for Gaming or for a DVR as well!
4,Worth the hassle,"I, like many others, had huge headaches initially setting up this wireless adapter. I actually had to go to a friend's house and use his computer to set it up because (after a couple of hours and several attempts) Linksys Support said that my wireless router was too old to communicate with this adapter (at least for setup, not for use thereafter). However, after all the hassle of getting the wireless adapter setup, the pay off has been amazing. I haven't had any problems since the initial setup and I have used it to get both my PS3 and Xbox 360 online flawlessly. So it was pain in the butt to set up, but it has ultimately been worth it."
1,Never received the item!!,Never received the product and the seller would not respond to any emails inquiring about it. My reimbursement claim filed with Amazon is currently pending.
1,This thing is terrible,"I have owned this thing for about a year and somehow got it to work with the xbox at my old house after hours of frustation. I just got a 360 and took this out of storage since moving and guess what, it still sucks. Now I remember why its been in storage, trash day is Friday and thats where it will be. Just run a long ethernet cable, wireless is pretty crappy anyway..."
1,Let down by Linksys..again.,This is the second item I have purchased from Linsys which has not worked as promised. I purchased the same product from another manufacture which has worked as described. Linksys tech support is less than desirable. I would not recommend Linksys. I think a United States based tech support would be helpful.
3,Great... when it works. Here's the fix!,"Ok, after going through 2 of these adapters with the Amazon return department (Linksys informed me the first one was defective) and hours on the phone with Linksys customer support, I finally got it working. I have the Linksys WRT54G wireless G router and this game adapter DID NOT work right out of the box. After troubleshooting just about everything and anything what finally did the trick was found in the game adapters web based utility program found by going to 192.168.1.250 while the adapter is connected to your computer by ethernet cable. Leave the username blank and enter ""admin"" in password. Click on the advanced tab and make sure that static IP is selected. The Ip address should be 192.168.1.250 and the Gateway should be 192.168.1.1 (which comes blank by default) That one change got me up and running... GOOD LUCK!"
1,Terrible product,"The system claims it is a ""Wireless G"" device on the box, but when you actually read the documentation you find out that it is NOT 802.11g compliant, it is actually only ""draft 802.11g compatible"" which means it won't work with lots of devices. To make things worse, it doesn't support WPA, which is a required part of the 54g specifications, and is the only way to actually secure a wireless network. It supports WEP, but since that is hackable in seconds it is basically useless, and you can't have any WPA devices on your network if you have one of these. Even though Linksys has released updates for the firmware of the device, they still haven't rectified any of these problems, and there isn't any sign that they ever intend to. I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone at all."
5,"Worked out of the box, as promised","Originally I was using a Wet 11 connected to my Xbox on a Linksys 802.11b network. The configuration of the Wet 11 was difficult but eventually I got everything working. After upgrading my wireless network to 802.11g, even after a great deal of effort I was never able to get my Wet 11 / Xbox connected again.I bought this WGA54G game adapter, and as promised, it worked right out of the box (well, you still have to configure it from a PC initially). Most pleasing."
2,Save your Money,"I have owned this for about 2 years, it is a piece of junk. 54 Mbps max, does not always work with different routers, and the software is horrible; often hanging or stating it cannot detect the adapter when it is plugged into computer. Save your money and get a different brand (my Linsys Router was also a worthless piece of junk)."
3,"Good Product, Horrible Instructions","The product seems to be good although the instructions provided by Linksys are worthless. I followed the instructions provided by two different reviewers (Red Rhino and ""Rico"") and got the device configured and working on my PS2 in an hour.NOTE: You will need to set a static IP address (I used 192.168.1.249, gateway 255.255.255.1, DNS 192.168.1.1) to get the PS2 to connect. Make sure you transfer those settings to all of your memory cards or you will drop offline."
3,I have to backup the negatives,"I was trying to get this adapter to work for 2 hours. No thanks to linksys tech support. Then I stumbled on the review page from a google search and saw others having issues with WEP. I could connect to the access point with 128-bit wep but would not get an IP address. Low and behold, I turned off WEP as another user suggested and this thing picked up an IP address no problem. The funny thing is this thing will connect using WEP with MAC filtering off, but it still gets no IP. When I turn WEP off I can then use MAC filtering without an issue. I hate relying only on MAC filtering but until linksys fixes this puppy its my only option."
5,NO PROBLEMS,"I don't know why others had so many problems. I just got my adapter, skipped the entire installation process, and plugged it in. It Worked! No problems whatsoever. The thing kicks. Do not get distracted by the other posts. This thing is worth the money."
5,Couldn't Be Easier,This wireless adapter is good for more than gaming! Set-up was easy and quick. I am using the adapter to tie my HD-DVR into my home network to download on demand programing from Direct TV to the DVR.
1,Do not buy,"Terrible product, highly unreliable. Save yourselves the headaches of trying to get this to work with your network. It may work sometimes, but out of the blue it won't be able to connect anymore. Judging by Linkys' help forum, the ineffectiveness of this product is widespread."
1,"Short range, not worth it",Purchase a WIFI bridge and configure it. Much better solution and it can be also be used for games.
1,3rd one failed to work,"We've tried 3 so far and they all had the same problem - defective wireless transceiver. The setup was difficult and only possible with Linksys on the phone but does work. However as soon as we unplugged from the ethernet, no connection. Linksys has agreed that these units are defective and this probably explains why these reviews are either one star or 5. There seems to be a product manufacturing and support problem. This one will go back to the store too."
1,Not ready for primetime,"For whatever reason, Linksys thought it would be a good idea to write a manual that covered roughly 40% of all wireless network setups out there. For the rest of us, this product (and the customer support) are practically useless. I look forward to the day I return this product."
4,Nice product,"The Linksys Wireless-G gaming adapter does what it says for me. The setup cd didn't work, so I had to go in throught the ip address and configure some settings from there, but it only took about 15 minutes. It's now working from 3 stories up at 128-bit encryption. The only problem is that it is a little slow and sometimes drops the connection, but that is probably because it is three stories up from my router. Overall a nice product."
1,Don't buy this!,"This thing is horrible it dosen't keep the connection for more than an hour, setup is difficult and Linksys customer support is awful. If you have a Xbox 360 buy the 360 network adapter even though it's overpriced it works."
1,Linksys WGA54G Wireless-G quit working after one week,"The Linksys game adapter worked fine for about one week and then stopped working. I spent over 2 hours on the phone with Linksys support and they concluded that both the xbox and Linksys wireless game adapter were worked fine independently, but they would not communicate with each other despite changes to port settings, etc. I ended up returning the Linksys adapter and we intend to purchase the xbox wireless game adapter. I would not recommend purchasing Linksys and I base this not only on my experience, but on other reviews I have since read on this site."
1,Not working out of the Box,"This contraption gave me a headache after 5 hours of trying to get it to work. Like some of the other reviewers, I connected it to my network via hardline and it took the setup no problem. Although my network performane took a serious dive while it was connected, but that's another issue. Once the settings were complete it would never connect to my network. Even tried changing the static IP to something else and revamped my whole scheme.... didn't work. I work in Tech Support for my company and I'm usually the one taking calls from angry customers and this product pissed me off. I'm about to make the ugly assumption that there are plenty of defective devices out there since my issue mirrors that of the other posters."
4,So simple,I bought this adapter shortly before Christmas and have been using it since. It is very simple to set up and use. I have a network already established in my home using my Linksys WRT54G router.The gaming adapter comes with a cd to program your network settings. Put the cd in any computer and have the adapter plugged into your computer's usb port. Follow the simple steps as far as entering your network's name and security encryption code. Thats it.Plug it into your 360's usb port and you are on your way. I find it so hard to believe that anyone could have trouble with this adapter.It is too expensive though but to me it beats the MS 360 adapter as you can only use that adapter with a 360. This adapter you can use for PS or Xbox or any game system capable of online gaming.
4,Good product - compatibility an issue,"This product is working great, however, it took 1.5 hours with tech support to set this up to work with a Netgear router. The gentleman was very helpful...there just has to be a better way."
5,Worked immediately,"Despite the presence of plenty of negative reviews about this product, it was the best suited for my needs. I have a Linksys WRT54G router all the way across the house from my PS2, and wanted to play games online. It worked right out of the box. The documentation that comes with all Linksys products is minimal, storing the full owner's manual on the included CD rather than printing a manual when you may not need one. I hooked up the gaming adapter to my router, ran the included CD, then hooked the adapter to my PS2 and was online in about 5 minutes. There was no lag time, even at extremely busy times of day. I understand that installation may not be this simple for everyone, but my installation process was what Linksys intended, and it worked just like it was supposed to. If you want to play online with a game console, I highly recommend this product."
4,set it up in 15 mins,"After reading many reviews I was scared to buy this as they said making it work was very hard. I got this last week for my xbox and I also got my wireless router that same week and I am clueless to wireless networking(I just learn about B and G wireless, I thought it was all the same I'am that new to this) so I was scared of this after seeing many review.I got it up and running in no time hook it to my pc then ran the cd and it work, my only thing is sometimies it will drop me form a game and kick me offline not allot but it happen mostly when my AC is off it gets too hot maybe, as when it drops me I feel it and it is very hot but when AC is on it is fine.Online play is fine when it works no lag and everyone on the mic is loud and clear some games play a lil less laggy now like NBA2k when I would host there would be lag it may also be that I have a new router also but now it plays fine."
5,0 to wireless gaming in two minutes!!!,"In contrast to many of the reviews submitted here, I did not have one problem with this product. One thing I do notice between my situation and many others is the fact that I am using my WGA54G for the XBox, not the PS2 (at this time). For those of you using this product for the XBox, I predict that you won't encounter the problems associated with the PS2. I followed the setup instructions, and, problem-free installation happened as fast as I could read. I literally was gaming wirelessly in two minutes, and in a different room than my wireless router (Linksys WRT54G). When Gran Turismo 4 debuts for the PS2, I will be back with a review for using the WGA54G with a Playstation 2."
1,BobW,"Warning! Don't make the same mistake as I!Do not purchase this product if you utilize a higher level encryption (like WPA)! This adapter will only support WEP, and it's very misleading on the box! In fact, it doesn't even mention anything about encryption, but that if ""your setup's a little different - just configure your network settings through your PC's web browser, plug it into your game box, and go.""Hah! After spending an hour on the phone with tech support, I found out that their developers are ""working"" on releasing a firmware that will support WPA, but until then, I'll have to use WEP encryption, which is so 1990s (and this product was released in 2004)! If you don't care about wireless encryption, then this product is for you, but you're just asking for neighbors to eavesdrop on you!"
1,Locks-up Frequently,I had no difficulty in configuring the Wireless-G Game adapter. I installed a Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander as well to ensure a strong signal to the Playstation 2. Now it locks up about every 30 minutes. It is very frustrating to get completely booted out of a game each time this happens. I do not recommend this product. I contacted linksys tech support multiple times. I was told to change the channel and reduce the MTU. I did both with no resolution. We will be returning this product. Do not buy this product unless you can tolerate frequent lock-ups.
3,Works Fine but Setting up...,"I have now had this device on my Xbox for a few months and let me tell you that once you have the setup right, it works flawlessly and lag free. I have the Linksys Wireless-G router and they work well together.Now for the down side. Maybe a networking expert could get it going fine but not me. I am pretty familiar with computers and can get a wireless network setup. Getting this going on my Xbox was an absolute nightmare. I don't even remember everything that was done so I can't share anything helpful. Tech support is sent to India and they were absolutely useless and the wait was horrendous. Customer support is gonna kill Linksys if they're not careful. After 3 hours on the phone, we got the thing working and it has been working great ever since."
1,Returned for Microsoft's Wireless,"Purchased this because it was cheaper than the Microsoft version. Unfortunately, after 4 hours of setup, 1.5 hours with Linksys support which ended with ""You must call Microsoft to get help with the X-Box"", I was able to get it working, barely. However, next time I tried to log on, it no longer worked.Returned it for the Microsoft version which recognized my Linksys and was up in running in less than 2 minutes. I highly recommend going with Microsoft's 802.11g wireless adapter from the start. You'll save some headaches and it's supported by MS, the Linksys is not."
1,go with another adapter,"I bought this adapter to use to wirelessly set up my xbox and after I bought it and brought it home I was having problems setting it up. So I called their tech support and after being on the phone and trying all sorts of methods the technician told me to take it back and get a new receiver, what a waste of time. I went out and got the adapter that microsoft makes and it set up in less then 5 minutes and the gameplay is great. This product wasn't worth my hassel when the microsoft adapter was so easy."
3,"Works, but it can be glitchy...","I read all of the reviews posted here before I purchased the Wireless-G Game Adapter, and like someone wrote earlier, it's much easier to config if you DON'T plug it directly into your PC's NET card; if you do so, chances are your computer won't even see it. Instead, plug it into your hub/router; from there, it's a snap. Just put in the CD, and follow the wizard's instructions. When I connected the device into the net adapter of my PS2, it set up easily - just remember the IP address you're given. However, lagtime and disconnections are frequent. It CAN be frustrating...I don't know if it's the distance (my PC is in my 2nd floor back BR, and the PS2 is in the front of my basement), or what, but this is a common occurance. If anyone knows a solution, I'm open to suggestion..."
3,Avoid this product if you use WEP on your network!,"I had to return this product, after spending a frustrating week trying to get it to work with my wireless network's WEP security turned on. (If it supports it, the documentation / support / website sure don't mention it.) Tech support also took forever to answer, FYI. Since I was trying to get my Xbox online, I picked up the Xbox adapter (ACIN:B0000C5FMJ) which (following a bit of a struggle getting the firmware updated) works with WEP just fine.I am sure this is a high quality product, and you should get it if you are not running WEP."
3,I Love Daryl...but,"I Love Daryl Coley and he is my favorite Gospel Singer, but I was dissapointed with this video. It does not reflect the awesomeness of the one and only Daryl Coley. His voice is not up to par, nor do the songs represent the best he has to offer. The film quality is not great either. I enjoyed the interviews better than the songs. The best vocal performance is arguably found on his accapella rendetion of Even Me. His previous video, Live In L.A. is much better than this, but it's out of print. I hope Daryl comes back soon with the type of songs and delivery all his fans are accustomed to. I still Love you. You are The Best."
3,This isn't Proffessor Momboozo!,"I should've paid closer attention to the age recommendation for this book, because this wasn't Joe Coleman, the underground comic artist and painter, but some other guy with the same name. What it is, though, is a nice little book about Greek Mythology that I'm sure your kid would enjoy."
5,Accurate English,"Accurate English is a text language consultants who work in pronunciation have been using for more than seven years now and it is still the best in its field for training adults to speak American English. Most of my colleagues use it and are pleased to report that the quality of the linguistic material, the clarity of presentation and the up-to-date dialogues on the accompanying cassette make this package not only useful but pleasant to work with. My clients agree."
4,Good English pronunciation material,"This is a text book for my friend who is taking ESL class, and I found her English pronunciation really improved."
5,Helps a lot.,"A good choice for a second hand textbook. Buth the shipment is so slow, it almost ruin my course. I hope it will be faster next time."
3,My fav shoes!,"These shoes were bought as a replacement to my last mocassins. I don't like that they have a rubber bottom though;makes it feel less authentic. And also, I don't think the sizes are true to size, my '8' was big compared to my older mocassins. I would suggest choosing a half-size under your normal size. Also, the fit for some reason was not as snug, I think perhaps moccassins have changed the way they construct their shoes, for these were very different fit/material-wise compared to my previous moccassins."
4,"Cute boots, but run small","I bought these boots and had to return them because they run really small. Also, the materials they are made from are not soft like some of the other Minnetonka boots."
2,Not as picture.,One size bigger than actual size. I wear a size 7 and it fits like a 8. Not comfortable and has a awkard fit. The laces are hard to keep tied and I wanted to return them but couldn't.
1,FAKE,Shoes were not authentic minnetonkas. Fake fake fake. I bought them assuming the look like the ones in the pic n the color n fabric were different
3,just ok,"It is not expensive.The quality is just good. But it is not looks pretty when put on. Just so so, I think."
3,longish shippment,"My order took too long for the shipment!And the tracking information told me that it was shipped in front of the house, which was not true!"
3,Warm boots but narrow.,"I like the leather boots but had to get a full size larger because they are soooooooo narrow. Most reviews said that they stretch out with wear but I would ask how many weeks of wear. I have a wide foot and I not only had to size up but have them stretched to be even half way comfortable. The height of the boot is also a problem. The top tends to dig into the leg and make it sore. I guess if you wear them only once per week the spot has time to heal. If you have a sensitive calf or a normal to wide foot I would not recommend them unless you intend to alter them mechanically, otherwise I would pass on the Minnitonka brand... Actually No I would not recommend this boot."
5,Stylish,These shoes are quite comfortable. I would recommend for style and comfort! Shoes run true to size! I look forward to wearing a lot!
2,"Do not recommend, Wait till they show it on TV","Picture quality Outstanding, Sound quality needs work. Story line and plot sucked. Chris C. must have needed the money."
1,What A Disaster,"First, let me say that I am a huge fan of the X-files. NOw, I have to say that this was the worst possible chocie for an X-files movie. OF all the great concepts, themes, issues, that could have been chosen they choose transplantation? There was so much more to do with the main themes deliniated in the series, such a shame. Also, some of the classic characters were not in it or barely in it (i.e., CSM, Skinner). Again, what a shame. Don't waste your time with this one, it sullies that whole concept."
1,Awful!!!,"That was a truly awful film. As a true fan of the show, I was so excited to see this. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Save your money and your time. The plot is laughable and it has nothing to do with the show or the paranormal. One of the worst plots in years. Now I know why this is on almost every critics list for worst films of 2008."
1,Tedious and missing its essential element,"Several gratuitious nude scenes by Amanda Peet might have helped light a fire in this movie, but I am not sure. The repetitive, dreary quasi-relationship of Mulder and Scully serves as a background for two stories, both with catholic clergy cast as the bad guys. Scully's sick boy plot was never well developped and Mulder's main plotline was suitably dark and fuzzy. No classic X-files wierd stuff here - no aliens, unexplained phenomena or great conspiracies. Only nod to this are the questionable visions of the disgraced priest. As an X-files fan I was bored and disappointed."
3,Glad I waited,"I waited until now to view the film and I am glad I did. After all the negative press my expectations were low.The film is a stand alone and is not going to be liked by fans of the TV series looking for a continuation of the story, that is missing, which was fine by me.Mulder has aged whereas I found Scully to be more attractive then during the TV series. The old chemistry still works.If you are ok with this film being a long version of a stand alone episode go for it. If you are looking for ""answers"" from where the TV series ended you may be disappointed."
3,"Solid Movie, Not Great, not Horrible","I just finished watching X Files and to be honest I am not 100% sure what to think. I did enjoy the movie and thought it was great to see DD and GA back together. I guess my question would be is this movie just a prelude to what is to come? If so, then I think the movie did a good job and fans should be patient for better things to come. If not then I don't really know what the movie accomplished. If you were a fan of X Files I would recommend, just tame your expectations. Since I don't know what the answer to this question is yet, I will leave this review open. I can only hope, however unlikely, that Carter brings X Files back to network TV. Until then, Supernatural on the CW will in mind continue as the best Sci Fi show on tv and X Files will remain a distant memory."
3,Great show.,No need to provide a review. This show was all the rage during the time it aired. I was disappointed when it was cancelled
3,Disappointingly average,"I was a bit sorry that this film didn't pick up on the major arcs of the series, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Neither great nor terrible, but if (as seems likely) this is the last that we hear from Mulder & Scully it is a disappointment. They deserved a better finale than this. Thank you, Mr. Duchovny & Ms. Anderson, for an enormously entertaining show."
5,The X-Files: I Want to Believe,"The always-complicated relationship between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully moves in unexpected directions. Mulder continues his unshakable quest for the truth, and Scully, the passionate, ferociously intelligent physician, remains inextricably tied to Mulder's pursuits. This movie has a gradual and cumulative effect. It involves evil on not one level but two."
5,Doesn't miss a single beat,"This movie carries on with the story very naturally from where we last saw Mulder and Scully. They are now no longer FBI and are coming to terms with what the X Files has taken from them, what it has given them, and how they can never deny the ways in which it has changed them personally. There are many many themes running through this story, many layers to discover with multiple viewings. This is not your original X Files, this is the show evolved, grown up and still loaded with more questions than answers. Big time props to Chris and Frank for having the guts to get this one to the big screen. For showing us who the characters were and who they are, and for leaving them in a place where they are possibly better equipped to face that which is coming in 2012 than ever before. No compromises here, just an extremely strong character driven story."
1,Horrible movie but great and timely fashion it was sent!,This movie sucked as in the actual movie story line!!! But the movie got here quick and fast and was in perfect condition just like i bought it in a store!!!
1,One of The Worst Films of 2008,"I am a big X Files fan. This is not an X Files movie, though. It's a very long episode of CSI. No aliens. No supernatural events. No monsters in the dark. Just a boring, plodding murder mystery. Save your money."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","This was horrible. Very boring, little to no plot, poor acting. Don't waste your time unless you are a huge X-Files fan and you just have to see it. I love the first movie. This one was very bad."
2,"Huh!... Ok, now what?","I have not read the other reviews, and i won't go through he plot. All I can say, is that i was disappointed with this film... I gues i expected to much, and received very little in return from one of my top 5 all time favorite TV series... Even though this had a few moments of thrills and chills is was just too much of a let down for me, and probably other X-File fans as well... I guess I was hopeing for some sort of continuation of the story line after the series ended, but no! Chris Carter gives us this bizarre, seemingly thrown together film with no real way to go. This idea may have work for the small screen, but this film was a bomb on the big screen... Hell, the movie ""The Forgotten"" with Julianne Moore was more ""X-Files"" related than this forgettable little screen germ..."
2,Disappointing,"A big disappointment. Having watched years of X-files with government conspiracies, alien abductions, strange phenomenon and twisted plots, this movie left much to be desired. To me, it was 'just another episode', and a weak one at that. The basis for seeking out Mulder's help seemed to be an afterthought in the plot.Despite all this, there were a few lines of signature dry humor, that elicited a chuckle. It was enjoyable to reminisce and see Mulder and Scully in action again.I regret buying the blu-ray ... more suited for a Blockbuster rental. I enjoyed the first X-files movie much more."
4,I will always believe!,"The X Files tv show was one of the hippest, wittiest,most beautifully acted and written shows on the small screen. I will always miss it. One of my first thoughts upon viewing the movie was that Mulder and Scully could easily reprise their roles ( on tv)without a misstep.I have no deep criiticism of the movie and dvd except to say it just was not long enough.. But the fact that I got to see my favorite characters was most satisfying. I think Chris Carter defined their feelings for each other more than he had in the past- Scully admitted she was "" in love"" with Mulder and they had a couple of tender, intimates scenes together. Also, I got the impression that they were living together( note Scully's remark about not coming back home when the conflict happened between them). I hope they will be back because I'm not quite ready to let them go!"
1,"boring, melodramatic nonsense","This movie makes little of the fun, suspenseful weirdness of the series and much of the boring melodrama between the couple. Scully's pained expression should be on the cover of the dvd -- it's what you'll remember most from the movie."
2,Huge let down. Weak.,"This movie was a big let down. This movie was no more than just an average episode that you could find in the series. I would say 80 percent of the regular series were better than this movie. Why go to the trouble making a movie, spending all that time/money just to make another routine episode? I expected a bigger scope. I expected something like the first movie which involved the big story line of the whole series. Another thing that annoyed me, which bugged me in the series by the way, is that the plot always seems to require either Mulder or Scully getting their butt kicked and having to be rescued by the other. The lack of imagination and ideas in Hollywood these days is astounding. Where has all the creativity gone?"
1,What a disappointment,"After watching the first movie and the series, waiting for this one all these years and just wanting to see a bit more Mulder/Scully action, watching this movie was a complete let down.It doesn't have any of the suspense, humor and/or storyline of the series or the first movie and the characters weren't believable.All in all a bad movie that doesn't live up to the series or expectations."
1,i don't want to believe,i don't want to believe this movie is soooo bad. the directing and acting are horrible. the plot is predictable and derivative. gillian anderson is almost unwatchable...i mean how can that be? chris carter's direction?!! it is a real shame if this is how the x files goes out. this is real B---material. talk about jumping the shark.
3,Grateful beyond critics,"As an x-phila from the very beggining, I have to say that this is a cult movie addressed to devoted fans who were desperate to see Mulder and Scully again. After 6 years from the ""The Truth"" and 10 years from ""Fight the Future"", IWTB is, above all, a gift in every way, despite the controversial media reviews (and even my own). Good or bad, strong or weak, massive or independent taste, I am deeply grateful with this film and highly enthusiastic with the idea of a third one."
1,Zzzzzzzzzz,"This was a mediocre, forgettable episode, nothing more. If it's going to be a completely stand-alone story, I think it should be a bigger, much better story than what this was. I loved the X-Files till Mulder left, I even liked the first movie quite a bit. The relationship stuff is nice, and interesting, but the main story itself is just a total dud."
1,NO,"I am so glad I didn't pay to see this in theatres. It was a waste of time watching it free. This was the dummest movie. To me, it had nothing to do with X-Files, it just had the same main characters. The first movie was awesome. Do not buy this. Save your money."
2,Could have been a TV episode!,"Being a huge X-Files fan I am very disappointed. The first movie was great and I'm sure the X-Filers were eager for the long awaited 2nd feature film but Chris Carter and the production team blew it on this one. Everything about this movie could have been done in a regular TV episode. Not big screen material. What happened to the aliens and unexplained phenomenon? I had to keep from falling asleep during most of the movie. I cant even say it was worth the rental but it was nice to see Fox and Dana together again. I would have given it one star but just to see these two in the same feature together and the fact that I always liked the X-Files, I'll give it a weak two stars."
3,"""I wanted to believe""","I will always and forever watch the X files movies as long as it is Skully & Mulder. That being said, I was let down by this movie. I really appreciated the scare factor as well as the extra terrestrial aspect along with the government conspiracy. Those three things were blazingly missing from this movie. This movie reminded me more of those episodes that weren't really related to any mytharc, but a general ""oh that's what it was"" episodes that have some mystery, but not much more."
2,Disappointing end to a great show,"Went into the movie with an open mind and sentimentality. Came away completely disappointed and saddened that this was the exit this great show has gotten. The movie seems just an excuse to have the audience see Mulder and Scully again. I did, but I wanted a story too. There was no suspense. The scenes were connected but it seemed the parts were better than the whole. A real let down since the viral marketing [phony Werewolf pictures on the internet etal], secrecy about the movie and other hype couldnt help but work against the movie. The hype now seems more of ploy to take advantage of the audience and its connection to the series, knowing the movie was far weaker than the anticipation. Didnt expect it to be the greatest movie ever, but wished it would have been at least tense. According to many interviews before it was released, this was supposed to be just the first of X-Files movies to be made. Guess that is out of the question now."
2,X-files or X-pieces of bodies ?,"The story is bad to don't say stupid, and the video quality could be better for a blu-ray disc."
2,Not up to par...,"Big x-files fan here, and this movie was a huge disappointment. Had this been an episode, it would be on the bottom 10 or so.Yes, it was great seeing everyone again, but couldn't they have come up with a decent storyline?No aliens or mutants here - just a completely ridiculous mad scientist plot that made little sense, but did manage to throw in a great deal of gratuitous gore. The movie was almost a horror-fest - but without the suspense.I felt sorry for the actors - and even more sorry for the characters who now just seem dated and a bit deranged."
3,"X-Files, Okay","This was an okay movie but not what I was expecting. The movie trailers led me to believe a completely different story line than what was delivered. A bit disappointing. However, Scully was beautiful, as usual."
3,Not what I expected,Looking at the trailer and then at the movie I would have to say that I am disappointed in this film. I wish I had rented it and not purchased it.
2,I want to believe but I CAN'T,"The first 20 minutes are curiosity provoking but the rest left me saying to myself ""So what?"".**** SPOILER. DO NOT READ this if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the movie.The remaining of the film is far-fetched, not suspenseful and dragging.In North America, there's no group of people who are systematically killing others to get parts for transplants. It's because they'll be investigated by police very soon. It might happen in other countries like China where there were reports body parts of executed prisoners were collected for transplants paid by foreigners. I personally know the relative of a person who went to China to get a transplant. He did not have time to wait for it to be done in North America. The source of the transplant organ was unknown.Besides, the action scenes are like TV shows. There's no excitement.The film also drags in many scenes.It seems they tried to make an one-hour TV show longer to fill up 100 minutes.It's worth seeing once for curiosity"
2,Glad I didn't waste my money to see this in theater - Boring muddled mess,"While nice to see Mulder & Scully again, I think the passion and the scarey elements of X-Files was missing. I couldn't even stay awake watching this one. I actually longed for it to end. First time I've ever found the director's commentary more interesting than the movie as a stand-alone. And why the tired old stereotype of a priest with an Irish accent. This one sadly lacked the scariness and dark humor of the best of the X-Files standalone monster episodes. Glad I didn't waste my money in the theater, and only paid a few bucks to rent."
1,I wanted to believe...,"More drama than Sci-Fi... Skinner is in it for like a minute... Horrible script... The Psychic scenes are ridiculously unbelievable... A complete waste. Obviously Chris Carter has lost his touch. I was a huge fan of the series. And the first X-files movie was really good. This is just absolute garbage... No resoution to the problem, ten minutes in you feel like you just want to turn it off... 45 minutes in you are still waiting for something to happen.... You can safely bet that after this bombed at the box office and the mixed reviews from fans alike you will never see another X-Files movie, thankfully so... Also, Xzibit should not do film."
1,no wheres near the original.,"This was so way off the mark. I am so disappointed, the plot, the acting, all of it just didn't take off. It didn't have the magic I grew to love in the TV series."
2,Meh,"I missed this in the movie theater and was eager to rent it. Now I'm glad I didn't waste my money. I found the plot to be awful, the story predictable and the subject matter just not x-files enough. Sure it was great to see Scully had found a job she liked. But I felt the subplot with the sick child and the stem cell research a wee bit maudlin and slightly preachy. Okay I get it. Stem cell research. Religious people seeking to thwart intrepid scientists who just want to heal sick kids. Can I go back to being entertained now?The mystery- a missing FBI agent was just not much of a mystery and certainly not movie-worthy. About the only mystery in this was the pedophile priest turned psychic. But who cares?I want to see aliens, and mysterious mumbo jumbo. Instead this film could be any random FBI made-for-tv style movie. I lost interest halfway through and fast-forwared to the end."
2,dull and needlessly gruesome. waste of time,This was a huge disappointment. The beginning was promising -- the FBI works with a psychic to locate a missing agent. However it's all downhill from there as the plot becomes more convoluted. None of the special effects could make up for lukewarm acting and a story that didn't quite gel. Far inferior to the first XFILES movie.
3,"A bit disappointed, but I watch it now and again","I'm not sure even why I watch this now and again, because, as has been mentioned, this is the quality of one of the lower TV episodes, ""bottom 10"". I would in fact say that pretty much any episode would have made a better movie than this one. As one reviewer mentioned, they perfunctorily add some gore, as well, which doesn't add to the story one bit. And another reviewer, that the first movie was much better. I guess it's already pretty much all been said, so I will end here. Just a bit disappointed, however."
1,"A sad, sad, sad movie","The plot of the movie is uninteresting and Mulder and Scully are out of character to boot.I watched every episode of X-files seasons 1-7, but not a single episode of seasons 8 and 9, so I never know our beloved FBI agents as a couple. To see these two talking about divorcing (or separating) I am thinking WHAT THE HECK? If you never watched an X-file episode or the first movie, you would never have known the real Mulder and Scully from this movie. Where is the spunky, vivacious and confident Scully? Where is the sometimes kooky but brilliant-minded Mullder? Where is their chemistry?This movie is just depressing. Not because my favorite non-couple got older and don't look the same as before, but because they are just sad. Is it true when people grow older they just grow sadder? I refuse to believe."
3,Not a Movie...,I am huge X-Files fan and I am disappointed in this movie. To me is was more of a Long TV episode. I wanted more like the 1st Movie.
1,god awful,An embarrassment to the entire X-Files story. Dialogue was ridiculously bad. Huge gaps in dialogue for lack of anything to say so some dialogue is repeated to make filler.
4,Snow Flaky,"At the heart of this story is the weird notion that a convicted pedophile ex-priest has extra sensory powers that help the authorities find murder victims.The film is set in West Virginia, mostly in remote rural areas, during the deep winter. There's a lot of snowfall, bodies/body parts are found in frozen lakes, and a snow plow is driven by an evil dude as he commits evil deeds. Director and co-writer Chris Carter artfully makes the snow a key character, alongside Mulder (David Duchovney) and Scully (Gillian Anderson).I knew very little about the X Files before watching this film. I watched a few television episodes a long time ago. From other reviews I have gathered that this was designed to be a ""stand-alone."" That's what it was for me.It kept me interested to the end. There is a touching subplot involving Scully's patient, a young boy with an apparently incurable brain disease. There is plenty of suspense as viewers learn exactly why these people are murdered."
2,Disappointing,"I was a pretty big fan of the TV show, although moreso of the standalone episodes than all the mythology and government plots that plagued the series. This movie is basically like a stand-alone episode, but with a bigger budget. Unfortunately all that doesn't really help much, as both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson looks bored with the characters and the material, and the weak script doesn't give them much to chew on. Overall, a big disappointment."
3,What else is there for the fan to watch?,"Almost as disappointing as the last season, but you won't want to miss it. Sort of liking catching up with old friends..."
3,For fans,"I saw this in a movie theatre when it was released (I am an avid X-File fan)and then watched it recently by streaming it to my tv. It was suspenseful and tense, but also slow in parts. The relationship between Scully and Muldar is developed a little farther but is not satisfying. The more recent viewing showed clearly some awkward dialogue. Over all, it is dreary, grey, and snowy cold with very depressed characters. I don't think that people who are not familiar with X-Files would get it."
3,Comparable to an average episode in X-files TV series,Comparable to an average episode in X-files TV series.Some self references are too simplistic.Lines in Russian are very funny.
3,X-Files movie #2,"It was just ""okay."" Not any better than the regular episodes were. I wish it had been more about UFO's."
5,Best SciFi movie of the decade,My wife and I watched the original TV series of X-Files and loved the show. This movie brought back the good memories and more. We were on the edge of our seats as the suspense never stopped. Definitely Oscar material.
2,Really boring,"This is a long drawn out boring movie. I was really disappointed with the movie because the tv show was pretty good. The movie didn't have as much ""strange"" activity in it like the tv show did (aliens, etc). The story wasn't well put together and kind of seemed to be going in multiple directions all at once. At certain points in the movie i was wondering where they were going with the story. Then there was unnecessary CGI scenes in the movie that made the cinematography look really bad. Accompanied with average acting by XZIBIT this makes for a train wreck of a movie. Don't waste with time with this one."
5,Who is Frankenstein?,"I loved the movie. Revisiting Mulder and Scully was like bumping into old friends. But one question has been burning in my mind... Who were they rebuilding??? I would have thought that would be a mindblowing plot point. The only charateristic of the ""body"" they were working on was that he/she/it had curiously black fingernails (which the camera made a slow deliberate pan down the arm to). The CSM? Unlikely. But WHO????? This is killing me. Can't wait to see the film again. There's got to be a clue."
4,Great DVD edition,"My comment is about the DVD edition, not the movie itself (anyway I like the movie). This edition comes with a few additional scenes and a new end credits (with a picture of cast and crew). You can watch in the special features several new scenes (I like the deleted scenes). You can find pictures of the movie and the filmmaking. In the second DVD you find a special of the filmmaking, and in the third DVD you can download the entire movie in your pc, cellular phone or Ipod is unique for every DVD because it comes with a serial. I recommend this special edition to all then X-files fans.Lima-Peru."
3,I Was Expecting More,"I'm sure that many people who went to see this film were disappointed. With the exception of the Scully/Mulder relationship, which Duchovny and Anderson easily stepped back into, this film contained none of what made the series so interesting. By that, I mean there is none of the mythology here, and that's a shame. It's been six years since the series ended, ten years since the last motion picture, and what we get is a modern-day Frankenstein story.This film has a lot to recommend it: Duchovny and Anderson take on the personas of Mulder and Scully as if no time had passed; the movie is beautifully filmed and acted; Amanda Peet was surprisingly good (as she often is); and Billy Connolly is surprisingly sympathetic as a pedophile priest. That being said, I'm not sure Chris Carter and company fully understood what the fan were looking for here. After six years I think many of us wanted something that answered a few of the questions left after the series ended."
3,I Wanted to Believe....,"first let me say I am a complete X-Files fan, dating all the way back to 1993 when the show first aired. The series itself was/is one of the best produced shows in the history of television.maybe my hopes for this film were just too high- six years after the series ended, I was expecting a little more fireworks (i.e., supernatural elements similar to the first film).it seemed as though Mulder and Scully didn't have enough action scenes or sequences in this film- I think it would have played better as a t.v. movie, rather than a big screen movie. Too much dialogue between them. The plotting was a little slow and spread-out to keep my interest. The climax ending just didn't work for me, it felt ""forced"".That being said, Chris Carter, David Duchovny, & Gillian Anderson are very talented people, and I think they will go on and have great movies in front of them for the future."
2,As a former X-Philer...,"If Chris Carter and 20th century FOX didn't really want to do another movie,they should have left this foolishness alone or better yet,have had it for a ""movie"" of the week on ""free"" tv.It was good to see ""Scully and Mulder"" back together big screen or little screen.It was a shame they came back to this and gives little chance of another X-Files movie or reunion with these two well loved characters.There is no suspense,you probably had more suspense in ""Duane Barry"".Than the lack of plot,storyline and half-baked acting that was done in this.This movie ""might"" have worked maybe nine years ago,but with shows like CSI(Vegas).There was no way Chris Carter should have wrote a movie that felt like it was ""dated"".......Pass on this movie and go watch ""Fight The Future"" or the X-Files episodes from season 1-6 1/2.....you've been warned!"
3,what did I buy this?,I do love the x-files. I can't remember buying this but amazon is asking for my opinion on it so I'll be safe and say its okay. Its the x-files but not from the 90s so what can one expect. Okay internet I did my part now I hope that helps people spend the money.
2,I wanted to like it...,"DD and GA are always great together, but the story line is too silly. C'mon, a head transplant? GMAB! End"
2,Dissappointing,"My husband and I were avid X-Files fans. We missed this film when it was in the theater and finally rented it. If you are a fan, you might enjoy seeing Mulder and Scully again, but the story is weak, confusing and just plain disturbing - not intriguing like the series. Perhaps the most confusing aspect is the relationship between the two main characters. Are they together or not?"
2,bleh,"I used to want to believe, but this movie put the final nail in the coffin of my old X-file fan-ship days. Great memories of the show in the Mulder days."
1,A Shame of a Film for Such Huge Potential,"This film is terrible and a disgrace to the ""The X-Files"" saga, which was one of the best television series ever made. The film is inaccurate toward the history of the series, poorly written and has forced action scenes. The crimes in question aren't even an x-file. The FBI is uncharacteristically portrayed as unprofessional, Scully unbelievably does research for her next-day brain surgery on Google and Mulder's search for his sister is repeatedly brought up eventhough Mulder finds closure regarding her story in season seven. The only good things in the movie are Anderson and Duchovny's acting and an enjoyable end credits sequence and song. I am saddened by how bad this film was, there was so much potential after the end of the series."
5,I WANT TO BELIEVE THE X FILES MOVIE,GREAT X FILES MOVIE . A MUST TO HAVE FOR ALL X FILES FAN.HOPE WE WILL SEE MORE ABOUT THEM SOON.CONGRATULATIONS. A MUST HAVE .
3,It was all right...,"I totally agree with past reviewers. It was much like a regular episode with an open ending(aka no ending at all). For it being the last things X-Files, it didn't have a closing either, when it comes down to what has happened to dana/moulder after leaving the fbi and where are they headed now etc(the last episode had more of a closing than this imo). However for me personally, i enjoyed it just for the sake of having another 'episode' to watch. I enjoyed the series as a whole immensely, and am just sad to watch it go. I also laughed at a previous comment about feeling sorry for the actors/characters and how demented they seemed....yet after watching this i totally agree since you can really tell they've aged. It was all right for me, could have been better but could also have been worse."
4,X-Files Movie more intense,"This preview is excellent; the producers, writers and actors contribute x-files content and meaning to the shows development and explanations. I am happy to have their insight; it leads to a greater appreciation of this movie. Takaluksee"
5,amazing x-perience,"I've been a dedicated fan of the x-files since i was 8 years old and from a fans point of view this movie doesn't disappoint!I thought the chemistry between mulder and scully was not only still there but stronger than ever.the story was an adult mystery, with a sci-fi twist.I really enjoyed this movie, and I highly recommend it."
5,Buy it!!!!!!!!!!!,This was an excellent movie. Some gave it a bad review but you know that you can't make some happy no matter how good a movie you make and alot of people just wake up everyday with the sole purpose of bit#ching about everything that comes along.
2,The lack of a quality script IS the real mystery,"My girlfriend and i, over the past 6 months, acquired and watched ALL 9 seasons and both Xfiles movies.... The first movie was amazing. This movie, I am sad to say, proved that not even David Duchovny could perform a rescue. During the final 2 seasons, whenever it would get boring, he would pop up and completly reinvigorate my love of this show. What were they thinking? I don't need aliens or conpiracies to rate this show highly. I must be made to think outside of my normal thinking and I will follow. This show was weird, predictable, and played off of the desires of viewers to go where ever Mulder/Scully went without thinking. Sadly, I bought this on blu ray. It looked great, and that is my only compliment."
3,I wanted more from the Extended Cut,"As a huge fan of the X-Files and as someone who was disappointed by the 2nd movie, I was looking forward to watching the ""extended cut"" of the movie offered in this special edition set. In articles about the movie's production, Chris Carter moaned about Fox saying the movie couldn't run longer than an hour and a half and talked about having to cut the movie down quite quickly. I had hoped that the ""extended cut"" would fill in some of the holes I saw in the movie and would reflect Carter's original vision. Instead, the ""extended cut"" is only 4 minutes longer than the theatrical release and contains only one extra scene, that I noticed. Disappointing."
2,surprisingly weak,"This movie was a surprise to me for all the wrong reasons. I was prepared for high drama and lots of twists and turns and a good dose of extra terrestrial fare. I got very little to none of that! This movie felt more like a continuation of the lives of Scully and Mulder more suitable to one of the TV episodes than a full length, action packed motion picture. The premise was weak....Russians? collecting body parts to prolong life? In West Virginia???...lol. And the only bit of supernaturalness was the chaplain's visions. Then there is the awkward sub plot of Scully and her patient that seemed really out of place with the primary story. Seems the title 'I want to believe' was less about believing in extra terrestrials and more about religious belief. The movie was very slow to boot and rather dull...about the only redeeming quality, was seeing David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson reprise their roles as Mulder and Scully."
2,"A flop that shouldn't bare the ""X-Files"" name!!!","I have been a huge fan of The X-Files for a long time. Every since the first movie, I have kept my fingers crossed that there would be another one. The long wait finally ended when I first saw previews to this one. I cant even describe how excited I was. My excitement quickly died after seeing this film. This should not have been an X-files movie. If by some miracle the show could have been brought back to television, this movie might have made a half-way decent episode. There was no excitement, no mystery, no X-Files feeling at all about this film. My disappointment is long lived and if the studios were to even dare to make another X-Files movie....I will not waste my hard earned money going to see it. They lost me....they truly lost me. Fortunately I have the DVD sets of several seasons of the show to fall back on."
1,Terrible!,"I saw this movie in the theater and was expecting a movie about aliens, but instead it was the usual detective movie. I mean they play enough of those on T.V. This was movie was nothing like the series. It should have been a sequal to the first movie..."
1,"If I had seen this in a theater, I would have walked out.","I can only echo the other one-star reviews here, so I'll keep it short. This is the most boring movie I have ever seen. Had I gone to see this movie in the theater, I would have gotten up and walked out. I'm glad I just rented the DVD. The script is dead, the plot pointless, and these fine actors look utterly bored. I was especially disappointed because I really liked the first film."
1,Weak Story Line.,"I loved the X Files and the first movie. Why they waited over 6 years for the second movie is anyone's guess. The support actors were terribly weak in their roles. Also, the story line was just too weak. Also I just could not believe Scully was a doctor and performing brain surgury. Ridiculous transitions in the plot. This should not have been produced. Save your money or watch it on Youtube."
1,I want to forget,"I am a huge X Files fan. But to be frank this is trash. Complete trash. I did not buy it on Amazon, I bought in in a Dollar General for $5 because I needed something to watch. I was truly sad when I saw this movie. David Duchovny really sold out. I have not seen any other X files films but I own several seasons of the X Files TV show. The trademark of the series was glaringly omitted in this film. What I am talking about is the fact that there is always something supernatural going on regardless of whether it is a government conspiracy to cover up UFO's to the guy who eats livers and hibernates in the first season. Without revealing too much they end up investigating about head transplants on the black market. Concerning this main plot there is nothing supernatural about it. The only thing that is slightly paranormal is that a psychic helps them investigate. This movie isn't worth even renting. It also doesn't keep the viewer interested at all."
2,"Sorry, but..","Watched the first 10-15 minutes of this x files movie on fx and i ended up changing the channel. it's great that duchovny and anderson brought back mulder and scully, but sadly, this one's not as good and awesome as fight the future. sorry, had to give it a much lower rating."
3,Diiferent time...dofferent place,"And things have changed. It was just odd to see them back...but the story was very....standard. From the X-Files series, the stories, at least in the first 2/3 of the series, were very original.But then this comes along, and our heroes are in a pretty standard movie. Nothing really exciting, nothing really different. It was good to see Mulder and Scully together again, but the spark has dulled.And what happened to Scully's hair! It used to be Lucy red...now it's a long, straight dull mess."
2,Disappointing,"This really disappointed me as an X-Files fan. There was a standard set, and this could have been a plot for Criminal Minds. Chris Carter made sure that there would be no 3rd X-Files movie by coming up with such a mediocre plot. Just not nearly enough paranormal weirdness to be called an X-File, and after everything Mulder & Scully went through, to see them revert so (melo)dramtically back to their original believer/skeptic foles was exasperating."
2,I Want To Believe this could be better,"I am a huge fan of The X-Files, but I have to say that this movie was not what I hoped for. It is basiclly a stand alone episode. I think this movie could have been alot better if Chris Carter would have put some conspirasy therory in the movie. That is what made the TV show work.However, it was good to see Duchovny (Mulder) and Anderson (Scully) back together again.I am hopfull for another X-Files movie, and if done correctly it could be very good!!"
5,great read didn't want it to end,Great book with new ghosts. interplays nicely with the other draycott abbey books.
3,tarnished rhinestones,"I do like this cd its pretty good. My favorite song on it would have to be "" Bettin Money On Love "" Its great. "" Over My Head "" is another song that stand out to me. "" Train Without A Whistle "" Kind of feminds me of one of Tillis earlier hits "" Spilled Perfume "" Etc. It s agood But "" Band In The Window "" I think its too Honkeytonk. But you'll get over it. But anyway BUY IT Its worth it"
1,Not Good,"When the book got here it was a little smashed alot of the pagees were ripped, and I ordered all of my books on the same day and this one came about 10 days later."
4,A little tricky to hang,I bought this border to accessorize my Froggy Tales collection. It matches beautifully with the set. It is a little tricky to hang. I found that just adding water to the prepasted back was not quite enough to make it stick well. I added wallpaper paste to it to assure it's adherance. I also liked that it is a double roll and covers 30 feet rather than the standard 15 of most wallpaper borders. It makes my Froggy Tales Set complete.
2,A disappointment.,"I had to struggle to finish this, and when I did I actually threw the book against the wall. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and the ending just didn't wash. It didn't come from the rest of the novel, and it felt like the author suddenly became aware of a looming deadline and hurried to dash something off. The background was actually fairly detailed, and the plot seemed to have promise in the beginning. That's the only reason I gave it the star I did. This left me with no desire whatsoever to seek out any of the author's other books."
5,How to make Clothes that Fit & Flatter,"This is an old-fashioned book. Written by an old-fashioned author. She writes, not holding anything back. Today's (sewing) authors will write much about one subject. The old-fashioned ones tell all they know about the entire subject. (Meaning of course, that the old-fashioned ones give you more for your dollar.)"
4,Holy Mackerel - self-titled (Collector's Choice),"Originally released in 1968, this was the sunshine pop band's only album. Looks to be one of Paul William's early works. With this CD reissue, you get the lp's initial twelve songs + ten added bonus tracks for your listening pleasure. Most impressive cuts are ""The Lady Is Waiting"" (both versions), the inspiring ""Somewhere In Arizona At 4:30 AM - Restaurant Song"", the country-like ""The Wild Side Of Life"", ""Love For Everyone"" and the somewhat stunning ""Listen To The Voice"" (truly, great flute work). Line-up: Paul Williams - lead vocals, George Hiller - guitar, harmonica, organ, banjo & vocals, Jerry Scheff - bass & vocals, Mentor Williams - rhythm guitar, Cindy Fitzpatrick - flute & vocals and Mike Cannon - drums. Recommended for fans of the Beau Brummels, Mamas & The Papas, Dillard & Clark and the Lovin' Spoonful."
2,"Nothing lives up to ""Wildflowers""","The track ""Wildflowers"", written by an ex-member of Jefferson Airplane, is so psychedelic I could not believe that it was the orangutang/singer/songwriter Paul Williams on lead vocals. It is so great! Unfortunately, the rest of the album does not reach that peak.I would just download that track."
1,Junk,"1) The Drobo sounds like a jet engine2) The Drobo is USB2, and can't even begin to transfer data even as slow as USB2 normally is.3) Good luck getting any data back when (not if) the next time you have to do a bios update.4) Anything over two terabytes and management becomes annoying, as suddenly you have 2 ""drives"" to worry about and manage instead of one.Drobo was a good idea, horribly realized. If you're looking for something more than a backup drive, do yourself a favor and look somewhere else."
3,Drobo support could be better,For a product that claims high-availability Drobo needs better technical support. I waited for about 40 minutes to be escalated to the next level when one drive bay did not work. I called back the following morning to see why nobody had called me yet and was told that it normally takes 3-5 business days!!Until Drobo can provide better support than this you should stay away from Drobo for any critical business need.Can you afford to be offline for a week or more waiting for Data Robotics to call you back and fix an obviously faulty Drobo like mine?
4,"Great device, poor connection...","PROS:The Drobo is a great device; it's easy to use because it does everything for you, which means no RAID configuration! You don't even have to have the same brand/speed/capacity hard drives! Just add some SATA hard drives, and it'll configure them for you.CONS:It only has a USB 2.0 connection. This is a major problem for me as I need to back up several hundred high-res pictures as well as HD videos from when I photograph a wedding. Having eSATA would have been a major improvement. It would have been nice if you could use it as a standalone NAS device, but it lacks Ethernet too.Other thought:If Data Robotics were to add eSATA and Gigibit Ethernet connections, this device would rule the external storage market."
1,Use Drobo at your own risk,"Do not buy this product.We bought this device after reading reviews. This product is a version 1.0 and it has a fatal flaw. Our Drobo ran for three days without a problem. On the third day the drobo was unaccessible. After working with Drobo tech support, it was determined that all of the data was lost.Use this product at your own risk. In my professional opinion, this device is unreliable for either production or backup purposes. If you already own a Drobo, make sure you back it up. When it fails, everything disappears, and there is no possibility of recovery.Fortunately, we had a full backup to recover from the mess created by the drobo failing."
2,DROBO is a great idea...if you have A LOT of time,"While the DROBO does everything that it was advertised to do (hot-swappable storage that grows with your budget), I am regularly seeing transfer speeds that fall below 4 MB per second! I think the issue is a direct result of USB being the only interface available, because all drives within are 7500 RPM or higher, and I'm running on a very fast gaming machine."
1,Not the vinyle version !,This is a bad recording. There is not all the titles wich were on the double-live album on black-vinyl. This band deserved better than this commercial muck... wich rhymes with [you know what...]
5,Details missing from the CD version....,"For those who are wondering, here are some details taken from the original vinyl edition.Graham Smith: violinCharles Dickie: cello, electric piano, synthesizerDavid Jackson: saxes and fluteNic Potter: bassPeter Hammill: vocals, guitar, pianoGuy Evans: drumsRecorded live at the Marquee Club, London on January 16, 1978.This recording is raw, primal, powerful, and unforgettable, and the band were as uncompromising then as they are with their surprise reunion album in 2005."
2,The Final Days Of Van Der Graaf,"If you are a newcomer to Van Der Graaf, avoid this and it's studio predecessor ""The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome"". At this point Dave Jackson's excellent sax disappears in favor of a particularly annoying violinist. This recording is raw, not particularly well mixed or performed. Peter Hammill called it a solo career after this."
4,Who has the top security clearance?,"The simple fact that the elected 'President of the United States' doesn't have the highest security clearance is enough to draw into doubt, if not destroy, the myth that the USA has a 'representative' government.Most people don't even know that the President has limited clearance.The question we should all ask is: if the President is not at the highest level in government, who is?Why aren't we allowed to even know who has the highest clearance, or what is the position of such a person and who appoints such a person?Who decides what the President is allowed to know / have access to?This documentary doesn't answer those important questions."
4,president's book of secrets,I purchased this dvd to help my nephew with a school project and he loved it. I found it to be fascinating and disturbing.
4,Interesting,This DVD is interesting. I didn't expect any State secrets to be shown so you shouldn't expect that either. A lot of it was what you'd expect; things everyone has speculated on being talked about in general by people close to the Presidency. There are some fun facts talked about that you'd thought were considered bogus by everyone but nothing Earth shattering.
2,boaring,this dvd is not worth the effort to stay awake to watch it. It has no new information and barley any facts to go with it.
1,A *BIG* letdown!,"I ordered this video in the hopes that it would reveal the ""secret"" of the President's Book of Secrets. However, it left the viewer with more questions than answers and did not really 'reveal' anything! I watched this video waiting for answers that never came. I expected more from the History channel. Very disappointed! Do not waste your time or money on this video!!"
1,Worst Meditation DVD ever!,"I have used several meditation DVD's that I have loved, after reading previous reviews I decided to give this DVD a chance. And I definitively wasted my money, as somebody else said, this should be in a dollar store. The exercise are extremely short (probably 3 to 5 minutes) and non sense. The voice in the DVD is not relaxing at all and is a stupid way of teaching mindfulness meditation. I can't believe others gave this DVD 5 stars. There is so much good stuff out there and this DVD totally disappointed me and my pocket. Don't waist you money in this DVD."
1,Not into this one.,"I really wanted to try meditation, but staring at a TV while watching this video was very bad for my eyes, and made my eyes very dry. I can't meditate staring at a bonsai tree or a waterfall on a TV.... I just can't do it..."
5,Powerful tool for STRESS REDUCTION!!,"Working with this mindfulness dvd has been a LIFE CHANGING experience and I would recommend it anyone! I'm a busy professional who lives the typical stress-stress-stress lifestyle. I knew it was time for a change, so I decided to buy the garden of now dvd to see what mindfulness meditation was all about. I was a skeptic at first, but to my surprise, learning mindfulness has made it a lot easier for me to stay centered in the stillness of the present moment when things get hectic and chaotic in life. I have tried other stress reduction products in the past, but this dvd really does make it MUCH easier to learn a powerful stress management tool!"
2,Disappointing,"The product description and the enthusiastic reviews filled me with high expectations. Unfortunately I am disappointed. As an introduction I watched a bonzai tree and a waterfall for a few minutes. Then during the body scan and the breathing meditation I watched a static outline of the human form, not much different to listening to a humble audio cd. I prefer the DVD ""Meditation for Everyone"" by Mike Harding. It's a more pleasant visual mindfulness meditation."
2,Bland and boring!,"No background music, very dry and bland. Glad I previewed as a rental before purchasing. Gaiam produces much better quality videos anyday! I suggest Maritza or Rodney Ye for meditation and yoga!"
2,overly short &simplistic,"come on! concentrate on a bonsai tree & the old body scan---they've got to be kidding-this disc needs to be in the dollar tree !!! bob brown oh wait i forgot the ""deep"" part--if your mind wanders-gently bring it back---to---the ole bonsai tree. how illuminating!!!"
2,Your Heart's In Good Hands,"Sorry, all, but I was disappointed in this one. I, too, am a die-hard Green fan who will buy all of his cds as long as he keeps singing. In my opinion, only Ray Charles rivals him in singing talent, and Green even tops him. But that is where this set falls short - it doesn't let Al sing. It is overly-produced. The background music and singers often are louder than he. The greatest thing about Al Green has always been that his wonderful voice and singing style could get into your heart even on your darkest days, and make you shout for joy. It was always the voice, the register changes, the inflections that were distinctively Green, that set him apart from all others. I'll keep this one, but one of his best? I don't think so. Listen to the Belle Album or I'll Rise Again. Then tell me you think this was his best."
1,INNOCENT SONG FINDS A WAY TO CAPITALIZE ON SHAQ,"Yes Aaron Carter is 13, and yes he has a good voice, but this song is just plain corny.This song capitalizes on Shaq - I am sure he got paid a large sum for the rights of his image and persona, and that just makes me sick.Aaron - you better start with some stronger songs or you are going to end up in Debbie Gibson-Donny Osmond land very soon with this shmultz."
4,Alright,"Its an alright song, not the best, but its alright for Aaron fans, 2nd track ""One for summer"" is very good!"
3,Short on facts,"Just finished reading this book, and as a former Ohio resident and professional paranormal researcher, I was disappointed. It is not very thoroughly researched or fact checked and in fact contains at least one actual untruth.It isn't bad for casual entertainment though. I just wouldn't ever use it as a reference."
3,Ohio State Reformatory,"Im not sure how this book could be written and not include the Ohio State Reformatory. It is one of the most haunted and visited places in Ohio. At the time of this book writting, John had not ever visited the reformatory. I think it s agreat loss not to have included such a magnificient place in this book."
1,Auto fan,"The item was delivered as promised but it was damaged. The driver's side fan was unbalanced which will probably create undue wear causing it to wear out faster. Since it is a plastic fan blade, nothing can be done. In order to replace it, I would have to order a new one and pay first, then ship back the damaged one, and then be credited. This was a lot of hours assembling and disassembling my vehicle. Not happy with the fan I received :("
5,Grizzly Bears and Doug Peacock tell us how we can survive.,"We are rapidly destroying the balance of life on this planet, and with it our chances for survival. Doug Peacock reveals intimate aspects of his life and that of some wild grizzly bears. In doing so, he shows us a way to better understand our place in the great web of life. Peacock's example shows us how to be fully human"
2,A book calculated for our times,"Too much verbiage on wandering through the woods; too little information on grizzlies -- although what's there is genuine. The prose style is typical ""American Public Simple,"" neither intellectually challenging nor capable of holding the reader's attention. Too many words -- at a high school reading level -- and not enough content. The Vietnam War flashbacks are largely gratuitous, something to capture the target audience. The entire work strikes one as a manufactured product, with reading level, content, style, and ""insight"" groomed by the publisher's editor, not by the author. A light read, at best, primarily for urbanites who need to believe there's still a metaphysical 'Wilderness' out there somewhere, where we can save our collective souls...."
1,"Chicago Metallic Professional 9"" Pie pan","The product arrived on time; however, we are not satisfied with the quality of the pan. It is not heavy duty.JDRESR"
1,This thing is hilarious!,"This ""alternative to yoga"" is just yoga with the names of the poses changed. Mountain pose suddenly becomes ""Mount Zion,"" plank pose becomes ""The Altar,"" and cat and dog stretches are called ""The Flapping Tent.""Too funny! I suppose those who think yoga is evil can do yoga without the guilt!"
1,Simply Awful,"Awful idea, horribly done. Do not waste your money or your time. You can do REAL yoga and still be a Christian and to think otherwise is close-minded and goes against everything the Bible and Jesus Christ teaches us- tolerance, love and treating your body like a temple- that is true yoga and truly Christian."
4,"More wonderfully dark, edgy string work from Mr. Shore.","Granted, I have not seen the movie, but I can only imagine how well this music must fit it. I absolutely adore the way Mr. Shore uses his string sections to convey the most emotion in his music. His brilliant use of low, brooding cello, double bass work is stunning and haunting and eery. Howard Shore has not only cooked up a simple yet wonderful theme for Panic Room, but also some wonderful suspense music to fill in the film's dark ""David Finch directed"" nature. If you love Shore's music, you'll still be amazed by this score and what Shore can accomplish with strings. This is nothing like his score to 'Fellowship of the Ring', but it's a very different kind of score, and certainly another worthy addition to Mr. Shore's scoring legacy."
1,literary blunders,"This seems to be a cut and paste job of outdated sources. For instance, he again trots out the old ""With the guns pointing the wrong way, the island was virtually defenseless..."" (p. 67) routine. His sources are 2, from 1983 and 1970. Anyone seriously interested in this should read Operation Matador by Ong Chit Chung (Times Academic Press 1997) which very clearly shows the British high command had realized for many years that only way to defend Singapore from the Malaysian side was by by stopping the enemy on the peninsula, well short of Singapore. But even more egregious is failing the simple fact-checking exercise of where ""the guns"" pointed: 3 of 5 of the 15-inch guns, all 6 of the 9.2-inch, and all 18 of the 6-inch guns in fact had 360 degree traverse. Their actual problem was a lack of HE rounds, most of the ammo being of the armour-piercing variety and thus less effective against troops. If you bought this book, try and unload it at a second-hand store."
1,He did not get the How right!!,"After reading one of the latest books on the Custer debacle (by Fox), this book came up well short in conveying to the reader the occurences of the Custer battle. In fact, the occurences that the author stated as objective fact have been disproven by archaelogical research, Indian accounts of the battle as well as the basic understanding of U.S. Cavalry tactics. I'd recommend that readers look elsewhere should they be interested in gaining any insight into these events."
1,What a hack!,"Being a Pete Tong Hater is not always easy, but it always enjoyable. It is like people that hate the BackStreet Boys, or Brittany Spears. We hate them becasue of what they represent. They are the hacks that tap into the highest peaks of cultural popularity and try to make it their own. On 2000, Tong has struck again.Like the old Ronco Greatest hits that we used to buy at Kmart when we were kids (remember all the best songs, no hidden gems) Tong does the exact same here, taking the life away from some great songs. His track listing is a Greatist Techno Hits (as he has always done) and peices them together for our listening enjoyment. To make matters even worse his mixing is not the least bit inspiring.Such current house hits like (well every track) Koochy, Time is Now, Tell me Why are throw together just so Pete can make a quick buck. Do yourself a favor, just say no, and find some techno that will challenge you, but also move you...unless N'sync really are your hero's."
3,Good tunes...mediocre compilation.,"The other reviewer here is referring to the 1999 Essential Spring Collection...I think that one is better.Tong comes up short here. The tunes are great (""Woman Trouble,"" ""Koochy,"" ""Must Be the Music""....) but it's like he's trying to cover too much ground. So many styles to capture...garage, trance, house...Following tradition, Disc One is house, and disc two is more trancey.Pete Tong's always been more of a cultural mover/shaker than a DJ. The man's got skills, but his compilations don't always show it. Check out the 1999 Essential Spring Collection - it follows more of a groove with the soul-house-thing going on.Tongey just played a show here in Seattle as well...will club culture ever catch on in America? Only time will tell."
3,Good Material but Example Code doesn't always work,Lots of good information but very frustrating when examples don't work as advertised. Had lots of problems with code examples in chapter 38/39.
2,Mistaken Identity,"The previous reviewer has Rajani Palme Dutt confused with someone else. 'She' is actually a 'he' and he is a long deceased Stalinist stalwart of the CPGB. Dutt's early career was impressive, but as Callaghan makes clear he became a mouthpiece for Moscow. That said Callaghan's book is an ordinary overview and not very engaging. Dutt's life was more exciting than the version conveyed by Callaghan."
1,Stop slandering Dutt.,I haven't read this book but I have read a book by R. Palme Dutt and she is a great writer. Don't take antything John Callaghan says about her seriously. Read one of Dutt's books to learn the truth.
1,Very Disappointed...Customer Service Very Frustrating!!!,"I bought this radio for the remote and the MP3 capability. I was looking forward to using it to shuffle MP3 CDs. However, I was quickly disapointed as it skips the ends of the MP3s when in shuffle mode and playing MP3s. After several hours (over several months) on the phone, talking to multiple representatives, shipping three different units back and forth I finally got a refund. The time and effort spent to get my money back was even worse than the poor system. It took almost 4 months to get my money back and on multiple occasions the representatives did not return my calls. I tried the direct MP3 record once and that did not work either. Like some of the other reviews, if I could I'd give it a 0."
2,Not worth the cost,"I bought this boom box because of this advertised feature: ""Enjoy MP3 and WMA music from portable USB storage device/MP3 player"". I expected to plug in my MP3 player and listen to music. We tried four different types of MP3 players, and none were compatible (I-river, Sandisk, Samsung, and Trutech). It can play music from a jump drive--but that wasn't why I bought it.I also expected at least decent sound quality. The sound quality is terrible--really low-quality speakers. At half of max volume, the speakers buzz and crackle.I can think of only two good things to say about the Philips AZ1835: it comes with a remote control and has good radio reception."
2,Soo much money for the quality of the product,I recently buy this Boom Box and I'am a little disapointed because the quality of the material used in this. The sound its not good when you put it in the max level and the MP3 cd repeat the songs in alternation option. The price its not cheap for the quality but at this day its the only option for a usb player boom box in the market. I hope in the future Phillips go with a better quality products.
1,Disappopinting,"As a relatively new fan of Mythos, I found this CD and was not really pleased to see that it's really more of a DJ mix. Probably my fault for not reading more reviews. Not my cup of tea, and much more for those who like electronica"
2,Too Cheesy,"I am a HUGE NKOTB fan, but for my current age (30's)I found this cd to be quite cheesy. Maybe when I was a younger fan I would have loved it."
2,Pretty awful,"Once upon the New Kids On The Block ruled the pre-teen pop world. Long before Britney was marrying every piece fo trash in sight, Christina was VD-free and Justin Timberlake was still white, the New Kids had it all. Then their fans grew up and abandoned them. The New Kids got scared. Was it Donnie's burning hotel rooms or Jordan's falshetto voice? What's a band to do? Well first they changed their name to the more aggressive NKOTB. Then they pursued rap...yes, rap. They released a single called ""Dirty Dawg"" that went nowhere and with that the New Kids were finished."
5,They Will Be Missed...,"By far the best work New Kids On the Block ever released. Filled with R&B flavor throughout (a homage to their musical roots), sadly Face the Music did not gain the exposure it deserved. Too bad - what better way to end a long and exciting yet tumultuous journey. It was nice to see/hear the boys going back to their roots before backing out completely! Groups have come and gone, but artists such as New Edition and New Kids On the Block paved the way for the generations that followed. If NKOTB were never your cup of tea, ya gotta at least give 'em that!"
4,I thought that this was a strong final album by them!,"I thought that ""Face The Music"" was the best album from 1994. No other album from that year came close, though there were a few that nearly toppled it. It was good pop and I liked that the members were involved in the writing of it. But maybe they ran out of things to do and that's why the album didn't do well. People moved on to other artists that year, and I was going, why aren't they onto NKOTB? But I liked ""Never Gonna Let You Go"" (my favorite), Dirty Dawg, You Got The Flava, If You Go Away, Keeping My Fingers Crossed, I'll Be Waiting and others. This was really overlooked that year, and if it comes up on some ""lost CD"" series 20 years from now, they need to acknowledge and respect it!"
3,Murder most Cantabrigian,"Fiske's deep affection for Cambridge, its colleges and its customs are apparent in Academic Murder. Although having spent only a year's residence at Darwin, a graduate college, Fiske clearly absorbed the beauty and peculiar behavior of this uniquely beautiful mediaevel town. Graduates and visitors of Cambridge will find entertainment and fond memories between Academic Murder's covers. Although the pace is slow and the ending predictable, each chapter brings a glimpse into the Cantabrigian lifestyle."
4,Ray Owens is the Tiger Woods of the Humor publishing world!,"And I hope he pays me as he promised to for saying this! If you have waited at airports for delayed or cancelled flights, lined up in eternal queues at supermarket checkouts, tied up in mile-long traffic jams, and other such happy circumstances we all face daily, this is the best thing since cell phones. I promise you, people who read the title will look at you oddly and won't bother you at all and will keep their kids away from you. The jokes are great too. That's why I give it only 4 stars...I think the next one will be even better. But like Tiger Woods, I don't know..."
5,Funniest Book On The Planet,Great Book. Couldn't stop laughing at the jokes. Read the jokes to my co-workers and they thought it was halarious. People who find this book unfunny have no sense of humor and probably find some of the jokes TRUE.
4,Laughs you can take anywhere,"This is the funniest thing I have read in a long time without having to log on. It is a great collection of jokes (some old, some new) and dweeb (or idiot) letters that Ray has recieved in response to his letters and his web site. Like his web site and his daily mailings, you need to be an ADULT. You also need to have a warped sense of humor that allows you to laugh at yourself, as you will surely see yourself in this book somewhere."
4,The ultimate coffee table book,"When you're ready to inspire your friends with your wit, as opposed to try to impress them with your wallet, then you have attained the maturity necessary to own ""If You Beat Your Fish It will Die"". Ray has assembled a sampling of some of his favorite JOKES and moments since 1997 for our enjoyment. If you like the website, you'll love the book.OK, OK! It's a joke book, think of it as a ""Far Side"" or ""Dilbert"" calendar that doesn't get used up in a year."
3,This is the old book -- you want the other one.,"I'm the author of ""An Insupportable Light.""This is the OLD edition, and it's a mess (Rory is right). It was used as a guinea pig for every new technology that came out, and it got some scars in the process.But now the story is getting the respect it deserves; Amazon carries the fully updated, proofed version, with computer artifacts yanked out. The ""thou"" forms made sense with the comics series, but they bugged me, too.So if you want this book in its best form, get the one with the red cover with the LOWER price.An Insupportable LightIf you like my other work, this is still top-quality writing, vibrant, well-researched, and full of very detailed illustrations. Even as the origin of the ""Stinz"" series, is still can stand alone.If you have this bad old brown-covered version, there won't be any more, and I'm not getting any younger so this will be the collectible. We already know what it's going to be worth when I go, because we've had proof on ebay."
1,DONT GET IT!,"This is the wrong CD....none of the songs that are listed on the site are even on the cd! Its not even the right CD...I've seen the right cd and what its suppose to look like, cover and disc, also the number of tracks..which is 44...the cd they are distributing on here only has 20 tracks and none of them are songs that are suppose to be on the cd! DEFFINETLY DO NOT GET THIS!!!"
4,Special Rare-Breed,"I purchased this book as a birthday gift for a friend. She would like to have a dog of this breed and wanted more informaton. She had been unable to find information elsewhere, so she was thrilled to receive this."
1,"Obsolete, inaccurate, insensitive, insulting","As a mother of a child (age 7.5) who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes this summer, I looked up any book that might help present his condition to his friends and classmates this fall at school.This one came with good rating, I bought it, and returned.Not only that it is obsolete (quote ""... I don't ever eat candy or ice cream or cake ..."", recommendation from the early 20th century), it is insensitive (quote ""... My sister thought diabetes meant I would die...""), and it is insulting that it was not updated since 1994 with a more medically accurate and more cheerfull attitude (quote ""...my mom cries because she worries..."").If you need a book on the subject, pick a more accurate, medically sane, and straight-forward (like ""My own Type 1 Diabetes Book"" by Sandra J. Hollenberg)...If you think that kids with type 1 should never, ever eat candy, find another doctor. But please, don't buy this book."
2,Not up to date on type 1 diabetes treatement for kids 2003,"I still read the book to my daughter who is 6 now - dx'd at age 3, but I change the wording to fit our treatment plan. The character states in the book that she ""never eats sweets or candy"" not even for birthdays or halloween. This is an out of date statement. Kids with diabetes do eat sweets and candies in moderation - just as all children should."
3,Not appropriate for newly diagnosed children without symptom,"While this book might be entirely appropriate for children who were ill when diagnosed with diabetes, it could be disturbing for children who were diagnosed at a routine physical with no symptoms and have not experienced any of the complications discussed in the book."
4,"Beautiful, restful photos invite you to stay a while","I love the Out on the Porch Calendar from Algonquin and look forward to seeing the new one for each new year. It is bright and colorful, contains interesting quotes, lists all major holidays, and gives ample room on each day to write in appointments, etc. The photos are fabulous and inspire peace and tranquility... a lovely addition to my sometimes chaotic office! My single disappointment is the lack of previous and future month calendars on each page for quick reference. Still, this is one calendar that will grace my wall for years to come."
1,Literary Scholarship Gone Horribly Wrong,"Long the exclusive domain of crank scholars trying to provethat someone -- anyone -- else wrote the works ofShakespeare, anagrams found in the text have nointellectual respectability. In this supremely silly book,author Richard Wallace takes the works ofCharles Dodgson and the letters attributed to Jack the Ripper, anddiscovers that he can find anagrams in both! To Wallace,this proves that they had to be the same person. To anyonerational, this proves nothing of the sort. Some of the anagramsWallace finds are bizarre (""Urine! Sponge 't!""), some arehilarious (""Beg, dole whores! I tax all evil tits!"") butmost are tortured and nearly meaningless (""I believe theFathers condemn penile nutrition""). To cap it off, thebook is poorly organized and badly written. In short,if this is the best evidence available that CharlesDodgson was Jack the Ripper, you can confidently scratchDodgson off your list of suspects."
4,Fascinating Theory,"Richard Wallace has indeed compiled a very thorough and thought-out theory thrusting Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) and his childhood friend Thomas Bayne to the top of the Jack the Ripper suspect list. Whether Wallace is correct in asserting that Dodgson was Jack the Ripper or not, the fact remains that he was indeed capable and ingenious enough to have carried out everything presented in this book, from the anagrams to the murders themselves. If even 10% of the anagrams in this book are correct, the evidence -- in all of his writings, childhood experieces and thorough education -- is still credible against him. Who can dispute such hidden messages in Carroll's work as ""I strangled Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes"" or ""He, Thomas Vere Bayne, I, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, reign as Jack the Ripper?"""
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL FOOD LOVERS!!,"I try to get my hands on all type of food reading..and this is one of the best books about food that I've come across on! In addition to containing useful information about the industry, it has recipes from each chef's personal collection. It makes you feel like true insider!! PS: the photography is excellent and a perfect fit!!"
5,The best gift for the foodies in your life,This book is truly an ideal gift for the foodies you love. I'm buying a stack for holiday giving. It's an entertaining and intimate look inside life in the world of hot restaurants.
4,A must for those starting in the cooking industry,"After only reading two chapters in the book, I can see it being just what one needs if they are debating on wether to start a career as a chef. This book is informative and descriptive in the ways of a kitchen. I highly reccomend it."
2,Just a summary of a summary book,"Not as in depth as Dorenberg and Page's trilogy, nor as critical. A mouthpiece for the industry, boosterism at it's most mediocre. Nor was the choice of chefs very fortunate...I ended up with too little info on those I love, and quite a dislike for a number of others."
4,Excellent introspective moody Lou-Reedesque pop,"This is an excellent indie album without any BS indie sounds; just smart lyrics, quiet music. A bit like VU's Quiet Album, good for angst."
4,Good compilation of material from MIT courses,This unique book represents a compilation of material presented by Prof. Yannas over a couple of courses at MIT. The material is clearly presented and will probably be best used by graduate students and experimentalists in the field. This book is not a list of protocols. It is a review of the field and a summary of the Yannas lab's impressive body of work in the areas of skin and nerve tissue regeneration.
3,Takeover Bid,I ordered 4 older Aphrodite cds. This is the best one. Not a lot of rapping/rasta BS. Dark jungle drum & bass.
2,"Motown, STOP THE MADNESS!!!!!!!!","Another Temptations 'Greatest Hits', 'Ultimate Collection', 'Best Of', yada yada yada!!!! This is a waste of money!! DON'T BUY THIS [junk]!! Motown wants to milk the legacy of the Temptations because the current group lineup can't give away CDs with new songs!!Why would old Temptations fans buy this for a few new songs & cute packaging, when we have anything that is worth owning by The Temptations.Motown does the same thing to Marvin Gaye's old music, so ignore all of these new compilations!! The music deserves 5+ stars, the item deserves [nothing]!!"
1,Disappointed,"The cassette only had REBECCA. The movie UNDER FIRE wasn't on the cassette. It was advertised as a ""double feature"" but it was really only a single feature. False advertising!!!"
4,Interesting look at all the different types of cities and the houses that exists within them,"This book features the many different types of houses that exist in the many different cities throughout the world. As broad as the range of houses that are featured in this book, so too are the conditions of each cityscape that it is built on. It is interesting how the term ""city houses"" evokes an image of a dwelling squeezed into a dense urban plot, but that is not always the case. Some houses in cities such as San Francisco or Vienna seem to enjoy a space that is only possible in a suburban context. Despite all the differences of the houses featured, they all deal with the issue of privacy and fitting in or out of the urban context that exists already.Some of the more interesting projects include House H by Sugiura Office and House in Rue Galvani by Christian Pottgiesser.amassingdesign.blogspot"
3,K2 Football,"The description from the seller did not mention ""composite"". I was expecting a leather K2 like the one I had as a kid. With that being said, the Wilson K2 Composite Football is a well made, composite football that will give the children in your life hours of football fun."
4,Great football: BLEMISHED,"This is an awesome football for a 6 to 12 year old. Smaller than a ""junior"" ball so little hands can hold on to it and throw it.My only gripe is that it is ""Blemished"". I had no indication from the seller that it would be (similar to an ""X-OUT"" golf ball). Of course my kid doesn't know the difference, so no big deal."
5,Great book on F-15C's in Combat,"The is another great book in the Osprey Series - lots of details and photos that haven't been see before. But if anyone is even looking for more detail, I highly recommend ""Debrief: A Complete History of U.s. Aerial Engagements - 1981 to the Present"" by Craig Brown - it covers all successful US Air-to-air engagements following Vietnam through the present day, including everything in this books. It isn't cheap at almost $50, but it covers almost everything in this books as well as much more. Either way, you can't go wrong."
2,Who Wrote This?,"I am thoroughly disappointed in this work form J California Cooper! As one earlier reviewer lamented, this reads like the work of a novice. I read the forward for some understanding, but to no avail. I STILL don't understand how she AND her editor can approve this work for print.I am an avid fan of hers, and have ALL of her earlier works. I am behind in my reading, because I have been enjoying Author Mary Monroe's contributions. Then to come back to one of my favorite authors, and get this; what a let down! Now, I will have to be careful when thinking of purchasing her books in the future."
1,Disapointed,I was really disapointed in this book. I have read all of her other books and I liked them a lot. This book however was no where near as good as her others. The stories all seem to end abruptly with no closure. I hope that her next book will be better
2,not for me,This way only so so. She writes WAY to slow for me. I liked some of the stories but they seemed much too long winded. She's not my cup of tea.
5,Life and the Dream,J. California Cooper has a great unique quality of weaving a story that touches the spirit of men and women. These stories along with the many others that she has written over the years cannot compare to other writers. J. is in a class of her own and I highly recommend that you share in the journey.
3,wild stars seeking..........,I love J California Cooper story telling i have all of her books i was a little disappointed with this one. it seemed rushed and unfinished. but i still love her stories and will continue to read her works.
1,The Charts Are Not in Color!,"In the section titled ""A Word on the Construction and Format of this Book"" the first sentence reads as follows:""This book contains 70 charts, 36 of which are in color.""Well, none of the charts in the book are in color. A big disappointment giving the high price of the book."
2,Mine was defective,"I recently ordered one of these when the price dipped right before Christmas. I already had one of the white-handled phasers offered by Art Asylum a few years ago. Since the Diamond Select toys were the heir apparent, I expected the same level of quality.I already owned the DS Orig. Series Tricorder and a Wrath of Khan Phaser. I loved them both. The black-handled OS phaser I received was defective, however, and the Phaser I unit would fall off at inconvenient intervals (just about any time the phaser was picked up and handled). I returned it and received a replacement. On this one, the Phaser I sat crooked, and the sound effects worked only intermittently. The overload effect didn't work at all. I returned it also. I am waiting for another price drop to try my luck again. Maybe I got the only defective ones that ever left the production facility at Utopia Planitia. We'll see."
4,Love it,"I thought this toy might be too fragile for a five year old but it was just fine. It has multiple phaser sound controls. One includes the overload which my son will turn on, leave it next to me, then run away as it builds its energy sound then ends with a TV-like sound explosion. We are not tired of blasting each other yet and I hope it never ends.Very happy."
3,Trekkie fan says fair to this one,Seems to be easily broken. Not easy to figure out. Laser light doesn't really shine any real distance or change frequency like it says it does. not enough variations of sound. I have other space guns that are more fun to play with.
4,"Impressive, even though plastic","This is as good as it gets in plastic; I'm tempted to buy the $300 metal version, but this isn't bad and is more than what I expected. No Treky would be disappointed."
1,Unbeatable,I played this game using a Sega Genesis Turbo controller allowing me to hold the buttons and not press them repeatedly (the Sega Master System can take Genesis controllers). The first fight was pretty easy and the training sequences were also easy but the second fight was impossible and that is with a controller that rappidly presses the button for you which is effective on Zaxxon 3D or Asteroids for Atari 2600 but not Rocky in the second fight.
1,Disappointing,I received the necklace with some of the stones on the necklace including the main stone (pendant) cracked. The silver tone spacer beads are also cheap looking. I am extremely disappointed.
1,This is not the memory card for VTECH Readers,"As much as I researched and read the reviews, this is not the memory card for children's vtech reader. Got the package and find out it's the wrong thing. VTECH company basically unhelpful."
4,Tears for Nigeria,"Martins Agbonlahor's book captures graphically,the sufferings and political tension in his native Nigeria. It is quite topical, especially in this present political dispensation. I particularly admired the way the author uses deep-seated Nigerian parables in buttressing various arguments he raised.In all, I would characterise it a satire of Nigeria's socio-political system and I recommend it for further reading by people who want to understand the complex social and political life in Nigeria."
2,mediocre and annoying,"i picked up this cd on impulse...it started out ok...with a deep growling voice....what happened next shattered my ears and hopes of this cd being anything id ever listen to again. a shrieking, whinnying elven flail bopped me on the head. that flail was the voice of the lead singer. im sorry, unless you can stand white metal 1980's shrieking throughout the ENTIRE cd...dont buy this. the guitars are decent and the drumming is skillful( thus the two stars). if i want music to read the lord of the rings to, ill pick up something easier on the ears( nocturnal rites, blind guardian)."
5,down home murder,"Having belatedly picked up the Laura Fleming mysteries, I am very pleased with the first installment. Being a southerner myself, Kelner's depiction of the South is dead on, & I enjoyed immersing myself in Laura's world. Family is most important in the South & in this book, as the mystery revolves around buried family secrets. This book is truly a page turner, & I enjoyed every minute of it. Laura is a very likeable heroine, & her observations of the South are comical but have deeper meaning. I'm looking forward to reading the second novel in this series."
2,Lightweight.,"This was the first book of Kelner's I have read, and I doubt if I'll be searching out others. Too much was given away from the very start, so that it was clear from almost the beginning who was to be the murderer, and easy to spot how the plot would be worked out. I love 'cozy' mysteries but this was just too insubstantial and the characters to lightweight for me."
2,Moves as slow as Mayberry RFD,"Talk about molassas. This book takes forever to read, because it is boring. There are way too many aunts and uncles to keep track of, and in the end, I didn't care who the killer was. Paw clings to life in the hospital for over half the book, while we wait for the anticipated murder to finalize. The back cover promises a deep dark family secret will emerge, but it came with a whimper.Sorry, I wanted to like this book. But it just didn't do much for me."
1,Crazy Expensive,"Ok so looking at the price of this book I assumed it was going to be a textbook. Its not even a paperback - Its a pamphlet. is this a joke? For ~$0.50 per page this better be a freaking life altering read. It literally is taking me longer to write this than it will to read this book. Also - printed in 1998. So let's recap: 12+ years old, weighs less than a deck of cards, smaller than my hand, could easily staple through every page book for $50. Thank goodness for the death of print media."
1,Wish it would work! Defective item received 2 times!,"This item was a gift to be used at our family holiday festivities. We put it together it sounded and looked great, but the CD player was defective. Contacted Amazon on Christmas Day, a new one was shipped. CD player was defective yet again. Now we are waiting for a new one. Both times I communicated that the shipping packaging may be the problem. I recommend this machine, but buy it from a store, not Amazon. I just wish there was someone in my area that sold it!!"
1,IT CAUGHT ON FIRE!!!!,"I bought this product for my daughters 6th birthday....once put together and plugged in, the machine started to smoke...not a little smoke, but soooo much smoke! The good news...Amazon gave me back my money right away. I purchased the newer model and so far, no smoke!"
5,AWESOME machine!!!,"My husband bought this machine for me for my birthday since I have always wanted one. Not to mention, the kids might enjoy it, as well. We all love it and have used it several times alone, with neighbors and at parties. The voice control and mic controls are great. The fact that it came with two microphones is definately a bonus. We usually plug it into the television so I don't have much to report on the 7"" black and white screen. I recommend this machine to anyone interested in buying a quality karaoke machine. It is definately worth the $."
5,Everyone should have one,"The karaoke machine was delivered in a quicker time than anticipated and was in perfect shape. It took only minutes to put together and we were up and running (or should I say singing). I bought it for the children, but have been using it with my wife more that I had thought. We even bring it to party's. I highly recommend this machine."
1,Great Machine if it Worked!!!!!!,The machine looks great and worked great for a day!!!The second time we used it it stopped playing music. We then had to return it and had to pay for the return shipping! I would not recommend this product due to my experiences with it!
2,My head hurts...,"This first edition is loaded with areas of missing code or incorrect code. Granted I'm not an expert (duh, which is why I bought the book as part of a class) but some of these scripts just don't work. In many examples and exercises there are HTML tags missing as well as VBscript tags missing. Very frustrating. There should be a solutions section in the back to compare homework with the actual answers so one can go back and dissect code at will. But as it is, I can't tell whether the scripts are not working because I'm not coding correctly or if it's because the AUTHOR isn't coding correctly. Can't trust the book for proper guidance. Shop around.Plus you should have a decent grasp of VBScript and/or Javascript in order to do anything here."
2,Keep Shopping,"Unfortunately I will not suggest this book for anyone else. If your looking for an ASP book this is not the one for you. In no way is this an introductory book, it even states this in the Intended Audience section. Yet its worse if you do know coding with variables, classes et-al; you will be incenced by the book. The code is very messy without any consideration for consistency (I can tell if one author coded one piece and then the other author wrote the next) nor coding standards. I really don't wish to read a book so filled with errors(proof reading anyone?). The code is sometimes just plain wrong and/or very messy. Example: When did SQL queries/Stored Procedures become VBScript; plus wrap-around for code is ignored far too often. Don't wait for the revision."
2,"Not too close and needless to say, no cigar.","This book is not thorough at all when it comes to the subjects it supposedly teaches on. Every chapter should be at least three times its length with detailed tutorials. I can't express enough how this book explains little if anything. Basically it shows you what the possibilites are without teaching it to you - similar to showing a McDonald's employee a BigMac but not showing the employee how to make it. Don't get me completely wrong, it does have instruction/tutorials. Though, like I said before it doesn't thoroughly take you into how it's exactly done. Bottom line: This book is great if you're looking for a brief description of ASP and its possiblities. This book is bad if you're like me and want to completely understand it at the same time. I hope this helps."
2,Bad Choice,"I intended to use this book to learn ASP and teach a course on it. The first 3 chapters were sufficient, but Chapters 4 & 5 were awful. None of the samples interacting with the Access database worked, even using the samples on the cd that came with the instructor's book. Don't buy it, because you will not learn to interact with Access. The basic stuff in the 1st 3 chapters worked though."
5,Out of misery and on the right track with Optimal Thinking,"I discovered Optimal Thinking while I was browsing in the self-improvement section of my local bookstore and couldn't put it down. Before I read this book, I would wake up every morning feeling hurt, furious and disappointed with myself, people and life. I won't go into detail but I'd been through some heavy losses and betrayals. This life-optimizing book helped me to understand my feelings, and made it possible for me to take my power back, and get my life on the right track. Optimal Thinking is realistic, and shows you how to integrate thoughts, feelings and situations and OPTIMIZE (not just improve) them. You learn how to let go of what is not in your control, choose the best options in your control, and lay disturbing issues to rest. Optimal Thinking is simple, and universally valid. In good and bad situations, I can now be my best and bring out the best in others. I feel blessed to have found Optimal Thinking."
5,"Absolutely fabulous, helped so much.",Its no wonder this book is used by the US army and fortune 500 Companies. I couldnt put it down. Never settle for second best again. Loved it !!
3,"Good, but lacks some depth","I bought this book because someone recommended buying it together with Good to Great by Jim Collins.It is a good book, but as you get further ahead in the book it seems to repeat the questions of the first chapters.What I like about it is that is makes you focus on what the best way of dealing with a situation is, instead of dealing with all the negative feelings you might have."
2,Yet Another Infomercial,"On the strength of the reviews here, I set aside my skepticism of self-help materials and bought this book. OK, go for the best possible result, and apply that principle universally. After twenty pages of this, however, it felt more like an infomercial than a book. I couldn't bring myself to read any further."
1,She could have wrote a pamphlet instead of a book,"Before wasting your money on this book please read this. If you just ask yourself in any circumstances and anytime that ""What is the best thing I should do?"" then you don't need to read this book. Because the author only try to work on this word ""BEST"" That's all."
2,There are better books,"I bought this per someone else's posting. I found this book to be poorly written and couldn't get past the first 50 pages. Although I can see where parts of this book would be helpful to some people, I think you need to first read a few sample pages online before deciding whether it's for you. A lot of what I read seemed very obvious."
1,She doesn't even understand her own title,"I agree with all the 1-star and 2-star reviews of this book -and wasted my money and time because of the 5 stars. The thinking person will not find this book to be about thinking optimally -which is what ""optimal thinking"" means. No, this book is about ""thinking ABOUT the optimal"" -and it is nothing more than that, repeating ""think of what is the best thing to do"" over and over. Maddening. Nevermind the other nonesense put in as filler. Read the other 1-star reviews. I don't care if you find this review useful. Those are."
5,Optimal thinking strategies depend on individual temperament,"Yes, I absolutely agree that Rosalene Glickman's book Optimal Thinking is an essential addition to any library on improving thinking styles. Of course, which book is most helpful and insightful for which individual depends heavily on that individual's temperament and philosphy of life. Optimal Thinking is an excellent book for positive realists. Optimists likely would prefer Positive Thinking by Vera Peiffer, and pessimists or neutral realists would like The Positive Power of Negative Thinking by Julie Norem. Context of application is important too, with business people looking at Filling the Glass : The Skeptic's Guide to Positive Thinking in Business by Barry Maher. And so on. Effective thinking is a big, complex, and significant issue in life. Optimal Thinking is a nice contribution to the pool of available books, and Rosalene Glickman is a thoughtful and clear writer."
5,Changed my life,This is a great book which has changed my life. It has all the tools needed to become powerful and productive in every area of your life. The 100 day program on audio is amazing as well. I highly recommend it.
1,Did I read the same book as those people who gave 5 stars?,I can not believe how someone can write a book like this. It offers not insight. The material is too general to form a thinking framework. It is not worth the money.
5,a powerfully useful book,"Optimal Thinking is better than other personal development books I have read. It is the first book that provides a road map for my own success rather than telling me to copy others. By defining what 'best' means to me and asking five optimal questions each morning I have become more productive. Since I have integrated optimal thinking, my business growth has more consistent rather than the usual up and down cycles."
2,One chapter would suffice,"I purchased this book based upon others' online recommendations.Had I seen it on a store bookshelf first, I would have been able to determine that it makes the same point over and over again in each chapter, and skipped it.Had I reserved it from the library without seeing it first, I would probably have stopped reading after a couple of chapters.The distinction between Optimal Thinking and Positive Thinking is well presented at the outset. The rest is filler."
1,I was disappointed,Honestly I was very excited to order the book from Mongolia because of those inspiring people's praise. After reading the book half way through I learned something. Important people may support someone without telling the plain truth about that person's book. I was disappointed with this book.
1,Seriously? (Definitely NOT worth your time!),"If I could give this book less than 1 star I would. I only read the first chapter because it was that excruciating. Not even worth the paper it is printed on. I did not purchase this book, but was subjected to it through my employer who felt that it was an important read to benefit my professional development. If I was recovering from a severe head injury and had no idea how to approach any decision-making process, personal or professional, this book might be helpful. The author apparently thinks her readers are complete morons. The content is also rather annoying in that there are many quotes from much smarter people than Dr. Glickman spattered throughout without any real connection to subject matter as well as truly ridiculous ""real life"" examples."
5,A practical terrific book,"I had never heard of this book before I attended a 90-minute optimal thinking workshop that was organized my company. What a blast. I loved every minute. We were all given a copy of the book, which the author signed. Optimal Thinking is a well written book that shows you how to best deal with difficult feelings and situations. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to OPTIMIZE their personal and business success."
3,This Is A Kid's Book,"This was a cute book and it was fun to read. I'd definitely recommend it for 10-14 year olds (although parents that are bothered by references to opium dens in 1920's China might wish to exercise greater discretion). That said, the book is definitely a kid's book. If you're an adult, be advised that this book isn't nearly as entertaining as the Harry Potter series and you may want to keep shopping for something else to read."
4,A Fun Read,"A very fun and engaging story set in a time and place I know very little about. The artwork, fold-outs and gee-wiz aspects of the story are especially well done. Some of the writing is a little flat; not up to the standards set by the artwork. I bought the book for me and am very pleased to report that one of my boys (age 11) has picked it up and is quite engrossed."
5,"Full of twists, turns and very cool characters!!!!","I love this book. Operation Red Jericho is right up there with Phillip Pullman's Sally Lockhart series. This book is filled with evil villians, really good good guys and a really drawing mystery.I also loved how Joshua Mowll used Becka's diary, real maps, blueprints, and real bad guys. This is an historical ficition book through and through. I would seriously recomend this book to any Phillip Pullman lovers."
5,CRYSTAL SINGER TRILOGY,"I READ THIS AS THREE SEPARATE BOOKS THEY HELD YOUR ATTENTION AND MADE YOU WANT MORE. GRANTED THEY ARE A SIMPLE READ, BUT WELL WORTH THE TIME."
4,THOUGHT PROVOKING SCIENCE FICTION,"ANNE HAS THIS WAY OF BRINGING THE MOST OUT OF A CHARATER. KILLISHANDRA REE IS THE MOST THAT THE UPWARD WOMAN OF THE 90'S WANTS TO BECOME. THE TRILOGY GIVES A PERSPECTIVE TO THE READER THAT IT IS OK TO STEP OUTSIDE OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE. THAT IS DEFINETLY NOT WHERE THE READER IS GOING. THE READER OF THIS TRILOGY WILL FIND THEMSELVES ""THRALLED"" BY THE EVER POWERFUL ANNE McCAFFERY. YOU WON'T LEAVE HOME UNTIL YOU'VE FINISHED!"
3,"A.M. does Sci-Fi/Romance novel, not bad if you like A.M.","Your basic Anne McCaffrey 'young-troubled-yet- sensitive-girl' novel (think Menolly of the Harpers in a different setting), who runs away and discovers (big surprise) she has hidden talents and discovers an exciting life. What I found most interesting about this book was the culture of Crystal Singers and its guild. What I found least interesting was the obvious hystrionics and writing that got thin in places and the 'gushy romance-ness' (ie the hero sweeps her off her feet, big brawny shoulders, etc... Maybe if this were 2, instead of 3, books. I enjoy Ms McCafferys writing, but this is a bit more of a romance/sci-fantasy, I think younger readers might enjoy this, esp those of the female variety. Worth Reading, just don't expect a lot."
4,Say hello to your new band mates.,Do you play guitar but want to play with a drummer and bass player? This is the next best thing to live band mates. The drums and bass sound good through an amp or PA system. There are lots of background beats to play with including basic 12 bar blues and you can just repeat a section of the beat to play along with a single beat. You can adjust the beat tempo faster or slower. I haven't gotten into designing custom songs yet but it appears pretty straight forward if you read the directions. Your DR-3 mates never make a mistake and don't argue with you either. For learning to keep time it is invaluable and so much more fun than a Metronome.
4,nice work on realm of spirit,"The 1983 publication date made me think this would be obsolete. But it had been given so much praise, I had to get it. Solomon takes hegel as fundamentally an ethicist(*which I agree with), in response to kant's ethics. I thought his discussion of the realm of spirit was superb. Grad, level; not post-grad. I'm glad I got it."
2,I guess you get what you pay for.,"I bought this product because I thought the price was great. Especially after about a year of pouring my money into the gas tank. I decided to get back into cycling. But I just needed a new headlight because I gave my old (excellent) headlight away to another cyclist.This light is just not very bright, doesn't matter what brand of batteries are being used. So, since it's not very bright, it's not very safe to use. The tail light is ok. The headlight however is about as week as a pocket flashlight.If you buy this and ride your bike at night, be prepared to be stopped and lectured by the police.The seller, however, is great. I have no complaints about the seller, just the product."
5,"""One of the two best books on 'Revelation' for teens and newbies!""","This is a great book for young teenagers! While I liked the more 'handbook' style of Jerry Parks's ""Dragons, Grasshoppers & Frogs!"", this book is more a verse by verse. Kudos to the author!"
3,Hasty but Tasty,"This is an entertaining mystery which introduces a new sleuth, Claire Reynier, who is a rare-books librarian at the University of New Mexico. It involves stolen books, a contested will and murder. It is fast-paced and humorous. Van Gieson does an excellent job of painting the character of her new detective without slowing down the story. Claire is middle-aged, divorced, practices tai chi, loves books and cats. Through her eyes we get a brief look at various facets of anglo culture in New Mexico and an even briefer glimpse of the landscape. The shortcoming of the book is its hurried feel -- especially at the end. The trap Claire uses to catch the thief/murderers is so transparent it wouldn't fool anyone. And the wrapup is terse as an afterthought. Others have noted the error with names in the final paragraph of the book. I will watch for the next Claire Reynier mystery, hoping that it will be a more fully realized piece of work."
4,Fun Soundtrack!,"Alan Silvestri is a really wonderful composer, and his skills shine in this soundtrack! All the orchestral segments are really great.My only slight disappointment was that I never realized that some of the songs like ""Hungarian Raphsody"" and ""Smile Darn Ya Smile"" were actually using MIDI, and not real instruments! You never really notice this in the movie because of the dialogue and sound effects over it. But here in the soundtrack, it is rather obvious, and when played next to the orchestral tracks, it can be a bit jarring.By no means is that a reason not to pick up this great soundtrack, for the music itself is very good, and the orchestral tracks are fabulous!"
4,gripping myth-weaving!,"Dolan has skillfully retold the famous tale from celtic mythology of Lugh-the long hand and how he has came to royal heritage and help defend his adopted homeland from brutal invaders.This novel has scenes of touching romance, brutal battles.This is one of the best celtic fantasies with it's blend of memorable characters and the author's own talent for storytelling.I look forward to her next book."
3,Strong first album shows signs of genre-busting,"This first album release from bay area instrumental masters The Mermen shows their beginning influences. Most of the songs are of the typical surf-guitar variety, but the driving rhythm section and the audio production hint at something more. Huge, lush reverbs and doubled guitars give an actual feeling of being in the water, instead of listening to some landlocked kid twang away on a cheap strat. High points include ""Ocean Beach"" and ""Splashing With The Mermaid"""
4,not for everyone,"This is early Mermen and is definately very different from Songs or Euphoria. No feedback, very clean guitar, much more ""surf"" than later releases. The songs on this CD reminded me alot of Duanne Eddy, a kind of 50's ambience crossed with the Ventures. All in all I found it very enjoyable and actually play it more than any other Mermen CD with the exception of the new one."
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"A few good songs, but over all very weak. These guys could be astounding with better material. Guitar work is great, but songs are poorly chosen. Not what I was led to believe was on the CD, samples misleading, they could do much better with the talent they have in the band. This band could learn something from The Blue Stingrays or Los Straitjackets, the two best bands in the universe."
2,RIP OFF,"The music is dreary and the number of tracks is listed as... 18 on the CD cover and the one I received has only 12, but that's OK because that is more than enough to put you to sleep. Sounds like a bunch of kids jamming in the garage with no clue as to what's next. Amateur production all the way."
5,The first release--a benchmark recording,"Krill Slipping is a good collection of music. It is easily the most accessible of their recordings, and shows their hommage to 60's style surf music. That being said, the Mermen redefine the Genre for the post modern, post psychedelic era. Lets face it gang the genie is out of the bottle. Roll with it. This is not my favorite Mermen CD, however, they are all recordings that, if not to kill for, at least to have and to hold. This is recently reissued, so get it while you can. The Mermen are easily the greatest psychedelic, greatest surf, and simply the heaviest band that there ever was. Get every CD you can. Also, if you like the Mermen, check out he Surf Coasters."
5,A great album.,"This is modern surf music at its best. It has all the qualities of surf with a bit of grateful dead, and lounge music thrown in. For me it makes a great combination. If you're looking for surf music with a twist, you've found the right cd."
3,Good value limited,"The transparent top looks like it should hold small parts; but it swings up vertically and is not removable. This limits its usefulness. Below that there is a lift out tray with two full length narrow compartments and then a bulk compartment on the bottom. Good for small tools, but limited in utility by the top tray not being removable."
4,Tool box.,"This did not work out well for me, in which it was ordered for. However, my Father loved and and is using it."
2,Not as expected,"The box I received was black on the bottom, not blue as shown in the photo. Also, the box has a very strong chemical odor. I am going to return it."
2,Weak connection at the right angle,"I would not recommend this cable but hear me out on my reason. I am unsure if this is a genuine Sennheiser cable since nowhere on the cable is there a 'Sennheiser' tag, instead it's a company like Mogami or something. I am not a name person, but when the 1/4"" jack spins and doesn't have that solid connection when plugged into the instrument, I question the authenticity of this cable. I had to pull the cable in a certain direction in order for the jack to make a connection. I know Sennheiser to be a top-quality name, and when I saw the opportunity to get it for a lower price here, I went for it. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with the cable, and since there is no returning it I will have to bust out the soldering iron and make it work the best it can."
1,Overpriced and boring,"This cd comes with the supperclub label... to bad for the label as it is soooo boring, it's a wanna be high class lounge music cd. All the songs sound exactly the same, and believe me.... I am there looking for good lounge music. One piece of advice a.v.o.i.d. IT! Unless of course you want to go to bed and sleep.Want good lounge music? Go and get some Hed Kandi cd's the winter chill selection the first couple ones avoid the last ones."
4,Interesting,"I don't understand why no one has reviewed this book. It has more insight into Howard Hughes's dealings with TWA than any other book on the market.Instead of the scandals, we get the Genius of Hughes."
4,Durable and comfortable,"I have 10 of these YogaAccessories Eco-Conscious Yoga Mats at my yoga studio, and many of my students prefer these mats over the regular thinner mats that I also have available. The Eco-Conscious mats are a little slippery for downward facing dog pose if people aren't careful with how they use their hands and arms, but for everything else they work great. My students especially like the extra padding that these give them. A minor drawback is that the mats are permanently dented from chair feet (we frequently use chairs in my Gentle yoga classes). This is only an aesthetic issue, because they continue to work well."
2,Not for hot yoga or staying put at all.,"While this mat is sticky to the touch and is a great thickness to cushion my bad knee, it is Terrible for hot yoga! It's slippery without sweat, but as soon as you get slightly damp, watch out! Furthermore, I do hot enough yoga to sweat a lot and the mat just soaks in some of it and then has these wet super slippery spots. My down dog becomes a danger zone. I'd keep it for low key in home use, but not in the studio. I have washed it several times and valiantly used it for a month to see if it would get better and no luck."
1,harmonic functions done wrong,"Too many lines of the ""it's easily checked that ..."" kinddetract from the value this might have had andwaste the reader's time.It would be smarter to purchase eitherthe Schaums outlines (pde) or one of themany Dover pde reprints."
4,Nice Product,"I surprisingly liked this product. Will definitely order again. Effective with odor control; yet, its smell isn't over-powering like so many other litter box additives."
4,Good solution for in-car mini playing,"This is a great solution for those who want to play an ipod mini in the car, charge it, and see the display. Worked for me until my mini died. I used mine in a Mazda 3 and plugged the output in the aux port that went to my head unit. The Belkin gives your signal a boost and provides a fuller sound than when you just plug the ipod into the aux port. When you turn off the car, the ipod is paused.A few tips - You cannot use any kind of skin or the ipod won't fit. The unit has two prongs to keep the ipod in place but one kept bending (probably because I tried to use a skin and force it) and made the fit very sketchy. I clipped off the prongs and it fit snugly thereafter. If you get a humming sound, you may need something called an Audio Ground Loop Isolator which stops the feedback. Radio Shack has them."
3,ITS OK. you can live without it,this item is not so great. here are a few down sides. my ipod is a old school mini the big kind and i dropped it once and it put a dent on the bottom of it and this base has two teeth on each side that will go in the wholes on the bottom of the ipod to hold it in place. i had a very hard time getting my ipod to go in i had to cut in and do some work on it. second problem it shakes too much when you drive around and i drive a small sport car allways on the highway very smooth ride but the arm moves alot its not as sturdy as i hoped it would beand second thing this thing dosnt do FM it will only work if your car is MP3 ready and has a audio plug built in the car.and this only works with minis mine is allready full and i was thinking of buying a 30G video pod and i cant because it will not fit in the arm. i would say save your money and get something that will work with all ipods and its more sturdy
5,Wonderful Game!!,Me and my older sister bought this game for our little brother as a birthday gift. He just LOVES it. He plays it a LOT. So if you are a fan of Yo-Gi-Oh! or know someone who is a fan then I do recommend this game to you.
5,Excellent Game,"For those of you who love original games , this is the game for you . Pretty basic but challenging at the same time . Its a classic and i would suggest it ."
4,FORBBIDEN..all right,"When I played this game, I thought it would be fun. Instead, most everything is restricted. The Card Shop has no cards, just a place to build decks and the only way to put cards in your deck is to have star chips. And if you lose one duel, you could lose the game. Not the best Yu-Gi-Oh product."
1,Screws with the rules too much...,"Okay, I'm not a super Yu-Gi-Oh! fan but it's all right. As long as the rules are right! This game completly changes the rules, there ar no effect monsters, some magic and trap card effects are even different, and worst of all is the starchip feature. If you completly cream an oponet you get a whopping 5 star chips when it takes over 1000 to get something decent. So that's 200 battles just to get something DECENT. To get a really good card, well prepare to give up sleep for about a month or play regularly for a year...If you want to play a good Yu-Gi-Oh! Game get Stairway To Destiny Duel for Gameboy Advance. It uses the real rules and real effects. I havn't played every Yu-Gi-Oh! game so I can't say what other ones are good, but this one's not."
2,Boring and why bother.,"This game is terribly dull and frustrating to boot. You have to devote a couple of years and hours in to get decent cards. The starchip requirement for decent cards is insane like 999,999 starchips simply to get Harpie Lady or Dark Magician which are no where near powerful as the the blue eyes white dragon. You basically have to cheat to get far in this game. Playing the honest way would be a waste of time. I recommend you either use game shark or have plenty of playstation one memory cards on hand to get somewhere in this game. Your deck is random whenever you start a new file. Most often you'll get a lousy deck.Overall don't buy this game unless you're a hard core Yu Gi Oh! What a waste of time and money. I sold my copy to gamers though."
4,"999,999 star chips!?","Give me a break. I wanted to get a Blue-eyes White Dragon on this game but it costs 999,999 and you only win five star chips per duel(sometimes even less). Also you begin with a very weak deck and you have to play about 1,000,000,000 free duels to get lots of star chips just to buy one card!? I should sue the creators of this game. Take my advice and do not buy this game. Instead buy ""Stairway to the Destined Duel"" or ""Dungeon Dice Monsters"" or something other than this that is actually worth $30.00! The only good thing about this game is that you can make fusions with monsters that don't create actual card fusions from the collectable card game."
2,It [is bad],This game totally [is bad]. For two reasons 1.because the game isn not challenging enough. and 2. When you buy cards you have to give star chips on eds you do not have to pay anything. get eds for game boy advance. i am YU-GI-OH
4,Cool Game,"I especially like it because I got Harpie's Pet Dragon,Metalmorph,and Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon.But I traded my Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon for a Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon and I traded my Harpie's Pet Drgaon for a Red-Eyes Black Dragon(after that trade I was wishing I never traded that Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon).Luckily I traded 4 cards for a Black Skull Dragon.I'm getting a Black Skull Dragon tin can so I can get another Black Skull Dragon.Anyway,this game is pretty good,but the part I hate is the starchips for the passwords.I want the GBC game Dark Duel Stories and I want a GBA so I can get Eternal Duelist Soul and Dungeon Dice Monsters.I also can't wait for the Yu-Gi-Oh! PS2 game Duel of Roses or whatever.Anyway,this game isn't all that great,but it's good enough for me to like it.4 stars."
5,Amazing and not what you think!,"When I first read about this bar on a candy blog I thought this had to be a bad idea. I hate cornflakes but something intriguing about it made me buy it. I was not disappointed. If you like Nestle Crunch or Cadbury Aero bars this is 100 times better. The crunch is amazing, the chocolate is creamy, and best of all you can't tell it's cornflakes providing the texture. Just a great candy that's satisfying. You won't be able to find it everywhere but Target carries a large selection of Ritter Sport and even better when you can get it on sale."
1,THIS IS JUNK - I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"I needed a business card software to create my own cards and I picked this by the title. I said 25,000 cards is more than plenty to find one to use. This is not the case. I lost 25,000 important minutes going through for nothing. The editor and the templates they provide are unmanageable. Worst editing experience. Couldn't even figure out how to use fonts for certain regions in the cards if it ever works this way. You get to font all or nothing. Screw it. I packaged this with business cards paper to make the limit for a free super saver shipping but now I regret it. I have more than 35 years of experience in many computer fields and I know what software is good and what is bad. The low price shouldn't be a factor to buy this product. The add ""25,000"" is technically correct but it is more like deception. I WANT MY MONEY BACK."
4,Worth a watch,"Nice animation, good characters and a tiny bit of nudity but not much of a story. I am a huge anime fan and i love watching as many anime movies, ova's or others. I came across this cuz I saw it at a store once but it was too expensive. I saw it on here and still passed, then one day I found it in a local anime shop and bought it pretty cheap. Anyways,I've seen this about 3 times and still couldn't find much of a good story but i do like the look of the girls and there are LOTS! lol. lots of action so check it out if you think its intresting. I recommend it, not highly though"
5,This book is wonderful for women of many faiths,"This books definitely will help any woman through crisis phases in relationships with men of the Christian belief. This book definitely allows women to understand what she is going through her life. However, this book should not be used to learn about wealth accumulation."
5,Love Junie B.!,"Ok,I admit that I am 14 years old and I still love Junie B. Jones. Even my mom reads them,she just gives you a good laugh. This is another great Junie B."
5,Best book ever!!,"I hope that everyone in the whole world reads this book, because I did and I couldn't stop talking about it. I acted like it was the only book anyone could read on this whole planet. It was very funny, but I do not recommend this book for anyone who does not have a sense of humor. In this book, Junie B is going on vacation to Hawaii. Everyone thinks she is so lucky to go, except for Lucille, who has been there a thousand times. She is asked to take pictures. Will her pictures turn out really good, or will they be horrible? To find out the answers to these questions and more, read Junie B. First Grader, Aloha-ha-ha!Written by Hannah, age 7 1/2"
3,Sample,I used this book as a sample. It was very nice and funny. I also used some of that book for a speech i am doing on speech team. I recommend any Junie B. Jones books for humorous speeches.
4,"Junie B., First Grader: Aloha-ha-ha! By Barbara Park","Junie B., First Grader: Aloha-ha-ha! was a great book. I really think that you should read it. Junie B. can do some really crazy and really funny things. All Junie B. Jones books are funny, but this time Junie B. goes to Hawaii and all sort off cool things. Read this book to see what crazy and funny things Junie B. will do this time!"
5,"Grouchpots, go home!","Junie B. Jones is not for everyone, that's for sure. But, not being a grouchpot, I'd follow her anywhere Barbara Parks takes her -- especially a great trip to Hawaii, documented Junie-style!Junie B., First Grader: Aloha-ha-ha is a super laugh-fest for both kids and parents, possibly the funniest one to date.Just wonderful!"
4,No Book is included!!!,"I really thought a book was included with this purchase, but it's not. Since that is the case, I believe this is overpriced! I bought this so my 1st grader could read along...and it could help with her reading skills, but I guess not. My bad."
5,the best ever,I liked this book very much especially when she went on the nature hike. I think this book is very funny and it was fun reading it.
1,Beware: Not useable with Kindle Text To Speech Function,"For whatever reason, this book and all of the Junie B. Books cannot be used with the Kindle Text to Speech function. Amazon should advise customers of this - as I would not have purchased these books."
5,Junie B. Hits Another Home Run,"Junie B., First Grader: Aloha-ha-ha hits home again with the 26th book of the chapter book series. In this book, Junie B. continues with her bit of awkwardness and sassy ways as she heads to Hawaii with her mom, dad, and friends. Junie B's teacher, Mr. Scary gives Junie B. a camera with an assignment to make an official photo journal while she is in Hawaii. Junie B. wants to make her pictures look exciting so she can bring them back to school for show-and-tell, but finds herself looking stupid. How will her photo journal end up? Can Junie B. have a turn of luck?I read this book to my little sister and we both laughed all the way through. Although some may find Junie B's antics bratty, we give it two thumbs up for the excitement and comedy all the way to the end.-Emilie"
1,DON'T BUY,"The previous review is true. Maybe the 1st inch on gel is luke warm, the remainder is cold."
2,Ok for what it was,Some of the activities were outdated but it was fun to get together with our group and have a guide of things to do. Some we had done before and others we hadn't.
2,Product Failure,"I purchased the Highland Karpak and used it about 4-6 times. The last trip coming down the highway about 65-75mph the pack flew off the top of the Acadia. I notice where the straps are ""stitched"" on top, it became loose. MAJOR design FLAW!!!!I wouldn't recommend these unless you need something 1-3 times max. Otherwise this pack can not take the wear-and-tear."
1,Quality Issues,Worked great first two times. Kept luggage dry through heavy rain and sleet. But after third use I took it off the car and there were multiple holes in it. I am currently trying to find a place to complain to the company but can't. I would not recommend this carrier.
1,junk,"We never used it because it won't work, the wheels won't turn in the soil.Bought it last fall to use this spring, was looking forward to planting corn, until I tried it, it was expensive for something that doesn't work, it has been to long to return it now."
1,Junk!,"Sum it up in one word...JUNK. No matter what tpe of soil I tried, the rear(drive) wheels would not turn. I was excited to put in a couple deer food plots and some sweet corn and sunflower seeds. Now I can't return this piece of #%$@, and I have $200.00 worth of seeds I have to do something with. It's a shame any vendor would sell this."
2,Difficult to Operate,"Soil must be very loose and fine in order to push, difficult to see if seeds are dropping into soil."
1,Seeding not consistant and poor design,"Don't even consider this product, go for the Earthway, which I see is now cheaper then this. I have used both. Ther rear wheel seed regulator on this unit makes it very difficult to use in anything but the best soil. It is hard to push and keep the wheel spinning (to keep the seeds dropping) if there are any clumps or rocks in the soil. The handle is not sized or angle right either. This unit is just difficult and frustrating to use. I have had to replant many plots due to poor seeding that the Earthway does perfectly every time.Also, the seed wheel are cheap. They are difficult to install and I feel like they will break if mishandled.The worst part of this is the row marker. It is mounted too high and does not stay put, making rows smaller then 12 inches almost impossibleThe whole machine is flimsy and I do not recommend it. I found a second hand Earthway and will never use this seeder again. I feel bad even giving it away on craigslist."
1,Big time con job by Amazon.com,"Amazon.com states under product description that this article is 2175 words long. The product details says that the article is 8 pages long. I ordered the article paying $ 5.95 and downloaded an article which is 319 words long. I have been an Amazon.com customer for more than a decade and this is the first time I have been cheated like this. I don't see any venue in their website to lodge a complaint. Also, this article was published in the reputed journal Theological Studies. If you go to their website, you can get the article for free!I am using the relevant book as a Text for my course on Cosmology and Creation. The very brief review by Moni Mcintyre is too sketchy to be of any value."
5,love this chocolate but...,"This is my absolute favorite chocolate -- it brings back memories of rum raisin ice cream I ate as a child. However, while I would love to buy these there is absolutely NO WAY I'd pay $8.37 shipping on each $2.69 chocolate square! The chocolate is definitely worth $3, but not $11!"
4,Great Book,"I purchased this book for my 20M old son who loves books. The book has big pictures, bright colors and shapes that form into different animals. A very interactive book. The only reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was because when I purchased this book I was unaware that it was not a board book. The book although hard on outside has flipsy, thin pages which are easily ripped while little hand are turning pages, etc. It took my 20M old a little while to get used to this book since he loves flipping the pages. Otherwise great book!!"
4,crawford has such talent you will roll over laughing,i saw this on british tv in the sixties and was one of the best for sure up there with are you being served anther great sitcom
4,No Sweat self-titled (Polygram),"Good sounding ten track longplayer by a band that I really haven't heard anything about since this CD was released. No Sweat puts forth their own brand of 'melodic heavy rock' for those who might fully appreciate it. Best tunes include ""On The Edge"", ""Generation"" and the ass-kicking ""Tear Down The Walls"" (simply never could get enough of THIS song). Just might appeal to fans of Bolt Thrower, Corrosion Of Conformity or Trouble. Give it a try."
4,Adrift in China,"I found this book to be an enjoyable, quick read. It is part travelogue and part business book, revealing the details of an elaborate hospitality ritual (involving lots of alcohol), necessary to do business in China in the early days of capitalism. I bought the book because it features the Chang Jiang CJ750 motorcycle as the escape vehicle of choice. This is a Chinese reproduction of a late 1930's BMW motorcycle, with sidecar, as used in WW2. I would have liked to learn more about the bike, but overall found the book to be well written and interesting."
5,PassPorter's Treasure Hunts at Walt Disney World,"I'm sure this is a perfectly wonderful book and I'll give it 5 stars based on how well it's written and how much fun it looks like it would be. However, I bought this book along with the Hidden Mickey's book and we soon learned it was impossible to do both, so we chose looking for Hidden Mickeys. I think the Treasure Hunts would be a lot of fun for large families, church or school groups."
3,"Good primer, but not flawless","""The power of the pitch"" gives interesting examples from the author's vast communications experience. It touches on a lot of different areas and is a good introduction for anyone who wants to get a practical primer in communications. The book focuses on how to sell your message in a traditional business meeting, but some problems in the book decrease its value.I bought the book with the intention that it would teach me more about elevator pitches. I was disappointed that only a few pages in the book deal with this subject, and that the author's definition of an elevator pitch is somewhat unusual. The author basically says that the goal of the elevator pitch is not to sell the idea, that will be done at a later meeting. Instead, the goal is simply to switch business cards. I was hoping that the author would work with the traditional elevator pitch format found at for example [...]The book also suffers from quite a few typos and some annoyingly pixelated images."
3,not as good...,Not as good or as extreme as their first album O.F.R. which made it so good. Some okay songs but as the trend in muscic was changing in the early 90's I am sure they got pressure to tone down their sound. too bad.
5,Evanescence,I loved this book read and done in one day. Hope to read it over and over! I was so very satified!!! Hope to read another one about evanescence since they are back and had a new Album. I will never ever stop believing in Amy. COngragultions to your marriage and have many happy years. Hope you have a family if you'd like that. I love evanescence. My Role Model that I am big big big fan of!! I hope to meet and go to a concert sometime. Own everything of evanescence and Amy. But like I have that kind of money which I wish I did.
5,The Science of Doctor Who,"This was a gift for my Son. He is crazy about Doctor Who. In fact he has designed ""It's The Tardis"" for iPhone/iPod skins and more on Society6. It is a great book to enhance anyone's collection. Again the packaging was great. Amazon exceeded my expectation in the time it took to get the book. Another Great product provided by Amazon. Your the Best!!!"
4,Some intelligence required,"This is a very technical read that will require a little more than just average intelligence to understand. It breaks down the science of Doctor Who and uses what we know today to explain how it all could be done in the real world. It gets a bit dry in places but overall its still a very interesting read. If you get into the Doctor Who and want to see the science in the fiction you will want this book. However, if your poor at math, ain't got a clue what quantum physics is, don't get what a time paradox is, or know what a sonic screwdriver is much less want one, then you wouldn't like nor understand what this book is about."
3,Fun to read but might be more science than Who fans would like,"I enjoyed reading this book that takes the fantasy of Dr. Who and shows where real science collides. You learn about how Time Lords have two hearts and then how, in nature, other animals have similar anatomy and the concept of a human like creature having two hearts doesn't seem so far fetched. This book isn't exactly a quick read and I found myself re-reading passages multiple times. I loaned it to a younger reader who is a huge Dr. Who fan and she devoured it in a day. However, when I asked her if she enjoyed it and read all of it, she said it was ""pretty good"" and she skipped the more ""sciencie"" parts."
3,Is it Sci or is it Sci-Fi?,"""Hey, it could happen!""""Naw, that couldn't happen!""""Now, that reminds me of something scientific.""""Do you remember when the Doctor . . .?""And so on and so on and so on. This book attempts to blend science with science fiction, but probably only arrives with a text that a Dr. Who fan could enjoy. Because Dr. Who is so campy, however, I doubt that even Dr. Who fans will be too impressed. They don't expect the series to get mired down with serious science. Now if the book had been about the social commentaries of Dr. Who, it might have been a hit! While the series doesn't involved itself too much in science, it takes every shot it can get at pop culture and politics."
3,About as Average as you can get,"The Science of doctor who is kind of an oxymoron of a title. It manages references to Doctor Who all over and manages to reference all sorts of theories as well but the connections it makes is so tenuous and so contrived that it's almost criminal that person would make the sale.There isn't a whole lot of Doctor Who and an awful lot of the science if very theoretical, it's not bad or boring but it really seems to go all over the place.It really seems to me like it is a throw together book to manage to make a couple of bucks off the Dr. Who franchise.I've been following the series for over 30 years. I take a lot of pleasure in the whole deal, but seriously this book wasn't the least bit fun.If you absolutely positively have to have anything with the words ""Doctor Who"" on it then I suppose you might buy it, but I can't think of any solid reason otherwise."
2,"""Put your guns up""","This is most certainly real underground hip hop and 7L's beats are on point. BUT guns-women-money are three things that I don't need in the music I listen to, and if you feel the same way then you should think twice about this one.""Straight off the top we some top scholars, poppin collars, Impalas, droppin dollars and dollars dollars dollars dollars so holler..."""
2,"Good introductory book, but not enough depth","This book would make a perfect companion for an introductory course in medical imaging or for someone who does not have an engineering background, but the book would have more appeal if a more in-depth treatment on the math. and physics of imaging is given. Simply too superficial."
3,"OK book, but not very useful toward a specific class","It is a pretty conprehensive and deep book and definitely covers a lot of medical imaging techniques. However, it did not help too much in my biomedical imaging class Duke University."
1,no love for the lover,Oleg Yankovsky was Russia's greatest actor and was in many Russian classics but this must be his worst. It is slow and draggy and goes nowhere. Cannot recommend in any way.
2,Errors,"I agree with the other reviewers who spoke of errors. The book twice states that Linux was invented by a Norwegian student, presumably mixing up the separate countries of Norway and Finland. It is generally known that Linux Torvalds was in Helsinki, which is in... Finland.The writer is a Mac advocate, and there is nothing wrong with that; though maybe this could have been made clearer in the publicity."
1,It's just a remix,"This is the Nokko album for people who don't like Nokko. You can barely hear her sweet voice over the drum machines. If you want to dance with Nokko, you might do better to try her earlier albums, I Will Catch U or Call Me Nightlife."
3,Selective Effective Treatments,I find this text very jam packed and dense. It is loaded with information but not an easy read.
5,A Must Have Reference,"This book is excellent! It is very reader friendly and practical; not only does it describe the disorders thoroughly but it also discusses typical client characteristics, preferred therapist characteristics,tells intervention strategies that research has found works best for the particular disorder, and then provides a detailed treatment plan, along with, a case study. I found this book to be very useful for counseling professionals and students. It is also helpful when studying for the NCE Or NMHCE exam!"
3,Helpful for Treatment Planning,"Seligman does a wonderful job with taking disorders from major diagnostic categories and distinguishes them from each other in a systematic manner. Her book completely is in line with DSM-IV-TR guidelines and diagnostic criteria, as a matter of fact, her book is similar to the DSM-IV-TR, but in paragraph format and with a slant towards helping the practitioner effectively provide therapeutic care for the client/patient.As I always enjoy in a professional publication, this book is a easy read and is not jargon laden. It is useful and easy to find information that may be needed to supplement information found in the DSM-IV-TR. The ending summaries and treatment planning guides are helpful and clearly related to evidenced based treatment."
2,Kindle edition,"Please take note that the Kindle version is of an older edition, which has around 100 pages less than the newer edition."
4,"good material, but all cans dented","I was very satisfied with seafoam. It works well. The price was good, and the delivery was good. What I didnt like was that I ordered a 6 pak and every single can was dented, meaning someone couldnt sell it on the shelf so he packed it up and sold it to me . None of the cans leaked, but it just was a little sneaky."
3,seafoam,"Purchased 6 cans of seafoam, this product does what it says. UZnfortunately four out of six cans were badly dented and one had leaked out into packaging. So as i paid more for pack and post than product i dont feel satisfied with the final product as a whole."
3,An OK read,"This book is lacking in feeling and, although it is an interesting read, it didn't effect me in any way. More of a narrative or diary with little feeling."
2,Not significatly different from Kaplan GMAT 5th edition,"I just finished working through this book and took the actual GMAT yesterday. Essentially, this book does not differ substantially from Kaplan's GMAT 5th edition in the difficulty of its problems or strategies. Kaplan has taken previous material and remarketed it in an effort to appeal to those who wish to score very high on the GMAT. While the marketing is compelling, the material is not worth the purchase. I would stick to Kaplan's GMAT 5th edition, which includes a CD of workshops, drills and practice tests that are very helpful(and include a broader array of advanced material than this book)."
1,"Poor editing, not so challenging math examples",This book was truly disappointing. This was the last book I used in preparing for the GMAT and it was so riddled with errors and poor explanations that it made me want to pull my hair out. The math problems were easy in the book but the actual problems I saw on the GMAT were much harder (and I'm a freakin' engineer!) I would recommend the Official GMAT study guide with over 1400 questions and irrefutable explanations (they wrote the test so they should know). My score was 740 and I think the Official Guide was the most helpful. I also used the Princeton Review book but it was not nearly as bad as this Kaplan trash.
4,Worth it just for 'Such a Night',"My gram was a HUGE Elvis fan and I grew up on TV dinners on TV trays in front of Elvis movies on TV - so I was THRILLED and surprised to hear 'Such a Night' for the first time during 3000 Miles to Graceland, which is a good movie, too."
3,Interesting premise,"An interestingly written novel, ""The Pornographer's Poem"" is a great read diminished only by numerous distracting typos. Where was the copyeditor on this one? This story and this author deserve better."
3,Story is a bit Choppy,"the cast is good the movie is ok....and Ya I'm a Paul Gross Fan.BUTThe story just seems to have a lot of jumps in it, not running real smoothly one sceen to the next. At times that's fine you know stuff like that is done, but for this movie I think its done a bit to much.The movie isn't bad but it could be a bit better done.The actors did a good job, won't say anything there.The Alberta background is like WOW, reminding me of Yellowstone. will agree with the one realestate friend, Eleanor, in the movie....ain't much for shopping though."
2,Just so-so,"The only reason to watch this flick is that you are a major Paul Gross fan and you've run out of other films. He is supposed to be a Polish cowboy who proposes to his neighbor so he can have her farm (!!!!!). The only good part is he's young, buff, and wearing skin tight pants. If you want to see Paul Gross funny, watch Due South. If you want to watch a mature Paul Gross at the top of his game, watch Slings and Arrows."
2,AMAZINGLY Deceptive,"Honestly, this is probably one of the best chocolate bars out there. As I'm sure most people agree they can eat this in one sitting much like any other candy bar out there and maybe most can it eat more than once a day. What's deceptive is the nutrition for it! What should be one serving is considered THREE servings. Each serving is 200 calories and 15g of fat. That means the whole package is 600 calories and 45g of fat! An average build person should only eat 60g of fat a day! So the amazingly great taste comes at a massive price and it's not worth it."
2,Doesn't fit the new Ipod video,"If you own a new generation Ipod video: do not buy this case. It's only designed for the 60 GB old Ipod so it doesn't fit the new one. My Ipod fits in half of the space in the case. The packaging said it was for the 60/80 GB but if you peeled off the sticker which said that you can see that the package used to say only for the 60 GB. Since the new Ipod ""fits"" in the case, they just did not seem to bother designing a new case that truely fits."
5,Slacktone at their best,"The wait is always so-o-o long, but finally the new Slacktone CD. Into The Blue Sparkle is a brilliantly powerful sparkling experiential sonic flow. Dave Wronski's sense of riff is unique. His writing is immediately identifiable, yet always fresh. This is the mark of a great writer, like Henry Mancini, Ennio Morrecone or Jim Thomas. Brilliant guitaristry supported by the trademark excellence of the best rhythm section in surf music. Dave Wronski's gorgeous guitar work, Mike Sullivan's perfect bass lines, and Dusty Watson's incredible drums... What's really hard is writing concise descriptions of talent this strong without seeming to gush on incessantly. Simply one of the best trios out there, Slacktone has put together yet another exceptional release. All I can say is See 'em, Hear 'em, BUY 'em! -Phil Dirt"
3,Thought it was a great book...,"...as a kid though. now that i'm older i realized that it takes place in ny so everything is fictional and not relative to me or if i had any kids. there has to be LA version of this book because it will apply to more real people with real childhoods not fantasy ones. For example, the kid in the book shops at nordrstroms for loafers, seriously? come one. as a kid i didn't even know what that was."
3,This book did not age well,"I loved Judy Blume when I was a kid way back in the '70's. I think this was the first book of hers I read. However, now that I am reading it with my 7 and 8 year-olds, I find myself wanting to stop and point out the mean-spirit toward Fudge. He acts hideously, but he is a 2-year-old! He is set up to be ""naughty"" (not a P.C. word we use in the parenting biz these days) Why is the mom in this book leaving 3 nine-year-olds in charge of a 2-year old in Central Park? Why is anyone allowing the father's clients in the apartment? Why doesn't the Grandma give the Mom a Xanax and a gift certificate to Parenting Classes at the New School? We will move on to ""Superfudge"" just to find some redemption.I would guess ""Forever"" didn't age well, either. At least we won't be reading that together this year..."
1,Not so great...,"My child read this book a while after bying it and she tried to chop it up! When we asked her why, she said she didn't like it because the boy ate Peter's turtle. I know that Judy Blume got it from a real life story, but it still was very inapropriate to me and my family. After reading the book myself, I would agree with my 12 year old daughter, so I wouldn't suggest this book to lets say, an animal lover or such. Another thing I found rather cruel, was that no one really cared about Peter's feelings, for instance, when ""Fudge"" stopped eating, they made Peter stand on his head everytime. I know that in the end they got a dog for Peter, but it still wasn't the best book to me and my family."
2,Lack of communication,"I got the book for a great price which I loved, but it took to long to come in the mail. Then after waiting so long I had to inquire about what was taking it so long instead of someone communicating with me 1st.If there's a problem shipping your product which I paid for then I shouldn't be the last to know. I didn't like the lack of communication."
1,Subversive,"I swear kids like this book because it is their first introduction to sexuality. The persistent thread of ""oh no, this forbidden thing can't be happening"" makes for a sort of naughty thrill ride, a sort of prepubescent fantasy about acts of social misbehavior. Covertly sensual acts (like the eating of the turtle, the ultimate ""oh no!"") and bathroom allusions help charge kids up in ways they can't even grasp themselves."
5,I loved tales of a forth grade nothing!,"I think everyone should read this book!Some of Judy Blume's books are not very interesting,but this one is!Judy Blume did a very good job writing this book.I especially like how she named Tootsie and Fudge after candy!I really think everyone should read this book!"
4,Very funny but needs stronger plot,"This book is about a fourth grader who's little brother gets in all sorts of different things. Now I'm going to tell you some of the story. In the park Peters brother, Fudge, thinks he is a bird and trys to fly. When he jumps he hits the ground and losses two of his teeth. Well thats all I'm going to say."
2,Not for everyone,"I was excited for my son to read this book. I thought he would relate to the character because he is also in fourth grade and has a younger sibling. I was not expecting him to be crying when he finished the book. I know this will not be the case for every young reader, but my son has a tender heart and really gets into the books he reads. If your child is soft-hearted and loves their pets dearly, skip this book!!!"
2,Take it or leave it,"Some kids may get a kick out of Fudge's brattiness, but others will find it woefully obnoxious, this one included."
5,this book is great!!!,"i am 8 years old and a boy and here is my review: this book is great for people that like problem solving books.and if you like this one,you might like diary of a wimpy kid."
2,Boring!,This did not read like a book more like a character description. The storyline was weak. Second Graders please read and make your own review.
5,Classic Book,"Peter's biggest problem is his little brother, Fudge. Adults think Fudge is cute and sweet, but Peter knows the truth! Fudge constantly messes with Peter's school projects, plays with his pet turtle, and embarrasses him in public. Their parents overlook Fudge's bad behaviors. In fact, to Peter is seems like he's constantly rewarded. Until, one day, Fudge goes too far and does something that Peter will never forgive him for.This middle grade novel is perfect for any child who has ever been annoyed by a little brother or sister. Blume expertly creates the sarcastic voice of an older brother under stress. The storyline flows smoothly, piling disaster on top of disaster until poor Peter meets his ultimate breaking point. Blume's classic, first published in 1972, will always remain popular due to its timeless themes of older sibling struggles."
3,tales of a fourth grade nothing,just as well written as i remember. my daughters school is now reading the series. makes u want to read other books from childhood.
5,classic,My son's 2nd grade teacher had been reading this to the class and he decided he had to have it on his Kindle. He enjoys reading me funny parts. His eyes lit up when I told him this was one of my favorites as a kid. Judy Blume writes fantastic kids' books!
3,How I like Tales Of A Fourth Grade Nothing,"I think Tales Of A Fourth Grade Nothing is 50/50 not great not horible. There is reasons I don't love this book but they are my personal thoughts but I liked the ending the best. If you have read any other Judy Blume books you know that fudge is annoying. But in this book Fudge is really annoying. If you like kids getting in trouble, a little laughter, and some New York fun I recommend you read this book by Judy Blume."
5,by daniel,tales of a fourth grade nothing is a fiction.Fudge messes up Peter's stuff. Fudge is very pesky with Peter. I think it is a very good book.It is a good book for fourth graders.I give it two thumbs up.
3,Review by a 1st grader,"I am a 1st grader and I just finished reading the book. I kind of liked it but the worst character was Fudge and also everybody liked Fudge and he threw mashed potatoes on the wall. Everybody cared for him even when Peter's turtle died. But Peter did still get a nice, fluffy doggie! The book was kind of bad just because of Fudge and I just hated Fudge when swallowed Peter's turtle. That got my mind for the rest of the day and I thought by the back Dribble is going to do something to Peter's little brother. But it was the opposite way. I kind of do recommend this book. (Mom typed my unedited comments)."
4,Judy Blume is a-okay in this house.,Judy Blume books have a permanent home in this home's library. She has a way with the written word. All of her books are age appropriate and well recieved.
4,Fudge`s Adventures,"This was a very humorous story about a mischievous three year old, Fudge. Fudge gets all the attention which exactly what Peter, Fudge`s older brother hates. Everyone out there who enjoy comedy this is the perfect recommendation."
4,I liked chapter 2 on Mr. & Mrs. Juicy.,"I liked it because it was funny, it reminded me of my big brother and my big sister."
1,This kid needs a spanking,"Most of the episodes in the the story were hilarious. However the last chapter was terrible. If your child ate his brother's turtle, by breaking into his locked room and laughing about it, what would you do?After Fudge is turned out to be fine, he gets presents, his already horribly favoring mother dotes even more, and his father gives Peter a puppy for ""being such a good sport""HELLO!!!!The mother is a sickening woman who favors her baby boy and refuses to punish him(except when he spoils a school project) and blames her nine year old son after she leaves him alone and Fudge falls off the jungle gym.Who leaves two year olds with three nine year olds???? This mother needs to straighten things out.The other Fudge books are twice as good as this one.Read them."
2,boring,"this book is REALLY boring, I could't even finish the first 3 chapters, I LOVE Judy Blumes books, it's just this one was like she slapped it together in like 1 week, not much of a plot either."
5,I guarantee this will be the most hilarious book ever made!,"Once you begin read Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing you won't be able to put it down. Every page is full of surprises with Fudge's pranks!! Once I got to the end I almost cried, maybe you will too! I guarantee this will be the best book you ever read!!!"
3,half Real good book and half numbing Filler,"At it's core the story is actually pretty good.Having said that, as a book.. Thumbs downTo me it seemed like almost every other chapter was a real momentum stopper.It felt like the author had about 60-70 pages of REALLY good story but the publisher wanted 100+I wasn't sure we would EVER finish it!"
5,Great storytelling,"What can i say that's not been said about Judy Blume? Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing is smart, funny, insightful, and a great story. You can't go wrong with Judy Blume."
4,this book is great,"Tales Of The Fourth Grade Nothing is a funny, captivating story about a fourth grade boy in NEW YORK. He wins a turtule at his friends birthday party only to see it eatin by his brother Fudge. His father works for Jucie-O, a company wich make nasty juice. Mr. Jucie-O (the owner of jucio)is so nice, however, he keeps supplying the family with free Jucie-O."
2,I'm a Mom with boys,"This book is obnoxious.I read this as a kid and I remember thinking the parents did a lot of yelling at Fudge, with no results.Reading it again out loud to my kids... this is painful. The parents have no order, self-control, or self-discipline at all. The book is funny in a shocking way, but not wholesome or worthwhile. It isn't even the outrageous-funny of a book like Roald Dahl's ""Matilda""... just sort of a sad look at a family that can not get its act together.At least reading it out loud, I can edit out or explain some of the questionable material: dope-pushers, muggings, child neglect.Language: shut up, that crazy kid, shut up, shut up! Can't you ever act human? I should have slugged him. I wish he was never born. I hate him."
4,Great Book for Fourth Grade and ABOVE; purchased by Unwitting Grandmother,"This was a great book for a Fourth Graders and above, either male or female. There's a lot of humor.However, this unwitting, senile grandmother bought this chapter book for her First and Second Graders, prior to going to Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing theater play (which WAS appropriate for First and Second Graders). I had tried to peek at the wording IN the book prior to purchase, but could not.Like their hand-me-downs, my grandchildren will grow into it! I recommend the book."
3,How two brothers get along.,"I think the book was an o.k. book . It was funny at some times in the book, but some times it was not true to life. I don't know any parents that would let their kids go to Central Park with out an parent."
5,It was a great story it will make you cry,Just an amazing book I suggest books from Judy blumeIt's an amazing story it will touch your heart. Judy blume is amazing
5,AWESOME,This book is very interesting. I love it! I Totally recommend this book! Judy Blume is a great author! The price to get the book is very good!!!!
4,You'll laugh your head off,"We have just finished Tales of Fouth Grade Nothing and we thought this was a funny book. It is about a boy named Peter and his brother Fudge. Peter thinks his mom likes Fudge better than him because she is always saying ""Oh my poor baby."" And she blames Peter a lot for what Fudge does. For example when he falls off the jungle gym and breaks his teeth. Fudge is always gettingattention like when he walks into the dining room when there are guests, wearing a gorilla mask. And when his friend pees on the floor at his 3rd birthday party. But he never gets in trouble. This book made us feel happy but there are some things in it that are sad and gruesome."
4,a really good book,I just read this book in my reading class.We had lots of laughs!I would recomend this book to 2nd grade to adults.I really enjoyed this book.
4,Peter's brother is a pain !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is a very humorous book. It has bad ways for parents to handle their children's actions. Therefore, parents can learn good examples from the bad ones. If you have a youger brother or sister this is a good book to read with your parents, and compare examples with your family."
4,The funny book,Thers a boy named Peter hatcher and he has a brother named fudge.Peter doesnt like fudge because he is a bug.He always touches peters stuf. like his pet turtle and other stuf.I think everybody in every school shuold read It.I rate this book four stars because It has a litle bit of mistakes.And sometimes It dosent stays in topic.writen by Alan cortes.
4,A really funny book,This book is a great book. In the beginning Fudge goes to his friends birthday. And he brings home a frog. Fudge tries to mail himself to his grandpa's house one day. He gets in big trouble from his mom. This is the best book ever. So I'm not going to tell you the end. Read the book to find out.
4,Tales of a fourth grade nothing,The book is about a boy called Peter with a little brother named Fudge. Fudge gets everything he wants. Peter has a pet named Dribble. One day Fudge ate Dribble so they gave him an operation... I would recommend this book because it is very sad...
5,FUNNY!,Fudge is always getting away with what he does and gets his older brother Peter into trouble. This book will have you laughing after hearing Fudge talk and after the silly things he does especially at the end.
5,Review of Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing by Judy Blume,"In Judy Blume's novel, Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing (Dell, 1972), nine-year-old Peter Hatcher faces the biggest challenge of his life: dealing with his little brother, Fudge. Whether he is ruining Peter's homework or swallowing his pet turtle, Fudge is always finding new ways to annoy his brother. To make matters worse, Fudge rarely gets punished for his mistakes and is constantly stealing the spotlight away from Peter. Next to Fudge, Peter feels just like ""a fourth grade nothing."" But as the book goes on, Peter discovers that he is anything but nothing. The book will appeal to children, especially those dealing with younger brothers and sisters. Peter Hatcher is the typical fourth grade ""everyman"" who children will identify with and respect, almost as though he was a real kid and their friend."
5,Kid's Review,"Tales of a fourth grade nothingBy Silvia.My favorite part is when Fudge had his birthday bash because weird things happened like when Ralph threw up! The part I dislike the most is when Fudge ate Dribble, Peter's turtle, because that was mean. The only good thing about that is Peter's dad bought him a dog, a beautiful golden retriever puppy. Peter named it Turtle after his turtle pet.I would recommend this book to a friend because it is funny and it's like my life with a pesky and annoying little sibling!"
4,Recommended for all ages,"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing has two main characters: The brothers, Peter and Fudge.Fudge gets in all sorts of trouble while Peter really behaves himself! I keep remembering when Fudge keeps smearing mashed potatoes on a wall in a restaurant. I also liked the part where Fudge gets lost in the movie theater. The last thing that I keep remembering is when Fudge eats a turtle! I think the book is an addicting comedy novel. I liked the book so much that I want to read the entire series!"
5,Very effective - like the old 'Super-CD' product,"If you remember a televised product called Super-CD that advertized '2 drops deodorize a skunk!', then this is an equivalent product. I had a 2-oz bottle of the Super-CD for years (and it was so powerful that I felt confident that 2 drops *would* deodorize a skunk), and finally ran out. I would use it to deodorize garbage cans on the infrequent occasion something or some animal (yes, there have been skunks!) left a particularly obnoxious odor, it worked very well; the product odor itself was rather distinctive and fairly pleasant. This product seems to have a similar odor (also fairly pleasant, smells like an aromatic oil not citrus), and seems to work as effectively, I imagine both products are derived from the same active ingredients. I also put a drop on my garage/workshop floor about twice a year just to clear out musty odors there."
4,Cute rabbit,My 2 year old loves reading about Rosie and her day! This book and all the flaps was especially cute! This makes going to bed seem fun. We were hooked and now want to collect them all!
4,Good Summary of SA Nuke Program,If you are interested in learning about how a nation can develop and deploy nuclear weapons and then rollback the entire process...read this paper. It provides a history of South Africa's nuclear program and how they eventually dismantled their weapons prior to eventual majority rule. A bit dated but still a valuable study in how a nation can pursue nuclear weapons technology and develop and deploy effective systems without conducting full-scale tests.
2,Desert Notes,"I think this book will appeal to people who spend a lot of time bouldering in Joshua Tree stoned at midsummer.I was expecting nature writing, which this isn't. I'm not sure what it is. Maundering philosophy? Unconnected rambling?It's so not my thing that I don't really feel that my judgment of whether it's any good or not is relevant. But for readers who are looking for nature writing in the vein of Arctic Dreams... this ain't it."
2,Gelatinous and an Odd Sweet Flavor,"I understand that opinions vary greatly in these things, but I cannot for the life of me see how so many people like the Sweet Baby Ray's sauces. I tried the original recipe and this. The original was very ho hum but I thought this one was kind of gross. The taste is slightly fake, as if its not made with sugar or honey but with some sort of chemical. The texture is a bit gelatinous which contributes to the feeling of this being a synthetic product. It reminds me of American cheese. Its not awful, and on the right application actually tastes good, but it isn't really cheese and eating it makes me feel kind of yucky.I have since moved on and tried a few other sauces commonly found in grocery stores. The one I landed on is ""Cattlemen's Award Winning Kansas City Classic Barbecue Sauce"". So good you could just drink it. Try that one out."
4,The sequal,"I was hoping for another quick read when I picked up Cate Tiernan's The Coven and besides being distracted with school, this was a perfect fit. After finding out that she is a Blood Witch, Morgan is thrust deeper into her Wicca studies and relationship with Cal (obligatory dreamy teenage boy). Unfortunately for Morgan, most of her other relationships are dying out as she becomes totally involved with her new life. She also discovers some new power. However, towards the end of the novel we begin to wonder if she can trust who she thought she could trust. There is a reason that this series has a lot of books in it, Tiernan loves to let the drama get thicker and thicker. It reads much like a teenage soap opera, but it is fun without a lot of heavy duty issues popping up. I recommend it to feed that guilty pleasure we have of watching teenagers dig themselves in further than they should go and wonder how to get out of the mess that they have created. Happy reading!"
3,The dark side of Witch hysteria shows up in book 2,"In book 2 our heroine learns she is a hereditary Witch adopted by a ""human"" couple after her mother and father were murdered by some huge evil magick that had killed all their clan except them.The plot includes a lot of jealousy and competition between teenage girls who all wanted the same man, and other teenage girls who are shallow and who play with boys for selfish ego reasons. It includes a confrontation and reconciliation with Morgan's parents over having not been told she was adopted. The mother of Morgan's BF, Cal, turns out to have some evil Witches in her coven.The story also includes a lot of gay push that adds nothing to the story or characters. Pushing homosexuality at teenagers is offensive. It loses points.These books are fairly light reading, quick to read, not very deep. Entertaining to read on an otherwise boring afternoon."
5,Young Adult books transcend age,"I just want to say I am 35 years old and I love the Sweep series. I love the price too! I have lent them to a 25 year old friend who loves them just as much, and now my 17 year old niece is reading them. None of us have been able to put them down once we pick one up. I am collecting the set, but am a bit frustrated that the new editions haven't all been released yet. I found the first editions for cheap and snatched them up because none of us can wait to see how things end up. Great reads, highly recommend for teens on up!"
5,Opportunity ...,"Morgan A sixteen-year-old girl living in world of betrayal and love. feeling alone and different not understanding what or who she realy is. Searching for the truth not nowing what to expect or what she might find!*I enjoyer this book and the way it felt as if it was not only talking about Wicca and magic, but about the lives of a teenage girls. This book has been the start of a wonderful journey..."
2,Not for the serious student...,"This book is fine if you know little of the Waffen SS or the German army during WWII. The photos are generally weak, providing few action shots. Most are typical portrait shots of significant SS figures. The four pages of color plates are drawings which provide little value. The text is general and provides no new insight for anyone who is a serious student of the German army in WWII. This book falls into the genre of those titles sold at hobby stores, to assist in the painting of military figures. Even in this context, it does not merit a strong review."
1,Load of Rubbish,"This book must be an attempt to cash in on the interest in this topic. The book is woefully biased, shamelessly propagandistic, and the information the author provides is just plain incorrect on page after page. Factual errors abound. I'm surprised his editors let him get by with so many mistakes. This author can't be passing himself off as an 'historian.' I would recommend just about any other of the numerous authors who examine the history, battles, and personalities on this topic. I find this book useless, sensationalistic, and a waste of time and money."
1,My children and I hate this dictionary,"Well over half the words my children (ranging in age from 5 to 12) have tried to look up are not in this dictionary. If your child can read, and speak English well, chances are he will never need to use this dictionary, as any word of which he does not already know the meaning, from casual conversation and reading, will not be listed. Here is a partial list of words my children have tried to look up that are not in this dictionary: fauna, saucy, waive, nosegay, allocate, alms, paradox, proselytize, fagot (a bundle of wood, in case you are wondering), alma mater, and many others. My kids have made a game of betting whether a word will be in this dictionary, and laugh when it isn't there, so I guess this book has served a slightly entertaining purpose. Otherwise, it was a total waste of money."
3,Ok light,"This light does not put put out the wide spectrum the cordless one I have does and is hard to use in automotive repair situations due to the close spread of the Led lights. This product would be better if it had a lense to spread the light out. The beam is about 12"" long and 6 wide at 1 foot so it may work great for other situations. It is constructed well."
3,This Can't Be The Voice on the Mercedes Benz Commercial,"I wrote this on a music search site after hearing Hayden's was the voice on the Mercedes Benz commercial. I hope they were mistaken:I've heard the ad too, but the singer deliberately mutilates ""String"" into a tuneless and incomprehensible blather, with an apparently purposeful baby-talk delivery. The worst thing since Lauren Hill's best. Don't call this moronic stuff jazz or anything like it. With Hill and now Hayden we are on the precipice of a dead culture, and going down fast!(A LATER ADD-ON:)Someone has emailed in to the search site that the person singing in the MBenz com is named Erin O'Hara. Sorry for the error, if it be so. Now let us all put an end to O'Hara's dead-culture noise ... !"
4,Birds Galore!,"This is a great book for all birders, but especially for those of us in Florida.The photography is wonderful and the information on the birds, their habitats, and breeding areas is very thorough.I recommend it highly!"
2,My opinion,"This field guide handy bird book to have around the house, but not so great in the field. The color illustrations offer limited variations for seasonal plumage and the color is very inaccurate. Most importantly the information and illustrations are in separate sections of the book making identification cumbersome. I recommend sticking to Sibley's or the National Geographic field guide."
5,Useful Guide for Florida,"Identifies the major habitats in Florida such as sand pine scrub, mesic hammocks, salt marshes, etc. Features include about 50 pages with color artwork showing the birds (grouped by type). The adjacent page gives a brief description plus notes on preferred habitat, then refers the reader to another page for more detail on the bird.Pluses: charts the months the bird is in Florida and also the breeding season, makes an effort to explain key differences in similar looking birds, the index is set up with little boxes so it can be used as a checklist also.Minuses: pictures somewhat small and at times overcrowded (ducks), it's a nuisance to flip back and forth from the pictures to the detailed write ups."
1,Disappointed,"Good book, but disappointing in that it was published in 1999, and the sequel never happened.Talk about being left hanging......."
5,Trishas very best album,"This album is so great. I listen to it over and over again, you just cant get sick of it. This lady has quite a bit of talent. The songs on here are just beautiful"
5,The Best,"Trisha Yearwood has to be the best female country singer. My fav's include ""There goes my baby"" ""Powerful THing"" an off another cd ""Shes in Love with THe BOy"" and ""I'll still love you more""(some popular hits) are the best song in the world. But it you'll love it!"
3,Good to listen to on a quiet afternoon,"This is a very mellow CD by one of my favorite artists. While the songs lack the depth of some of her previous releases (especially the much-mentioned ""Hearts in Armor""), it is none-the-less a must-have for any ardent fan."
5,You are amazing Trisha!!!!!!,You have a beatful voice Trisha and this cd is really good. But you did something with this cd that i thought nobody could ever do. Well I have this friend and he does not care for country music at all.So when ever i would go with him somewhere i would really be annoyed with his music. But finally we found something we agree on and thats your cd. He loves it just as much as i do. Thank YOU so much!!!!!!!!
1,Who picked these songs?,"First- I am a BIG Trisha fan, but have to ask... Who picked these songs? Did she hear them? Sheessshh! What a bad selection for such a great singer. She must be too worried about outside influences (ie a cross over hit). And one more thing.... ENOUGH WITH GARTH! I am tired of the duets and back ground singing between these two- are they siamese twins? Cut the cord Trisha... now off to the concert next week!"
4,HER BEST EFFORT YET,"Yearwood breaks the mold of typical country siren with an album filled with solid songs and her best vocal performances to date. The album is especially impressive when you consider that the first single, ""There Goes My Baby"" might be one of the weaker performances on the album!! This is a command performance for country, pop and even rock albums -- crossover programmers should pay attention and move her music onto adult contemp stations as well as country!"
2,Not Worth the Price,"I think Trisha is generally a sastisfactory singer, but tries to ""stretch it"" too much...aiming for high notes she can't reach. The song choice was good but some just don't seem to fit. I do enjoy There Goes My Baby. But it's not one of those CD's you can pop in the player and let it play all night."
2,wears off quickly,"Although I like the concept of taking Mexican music and putting an electronic spin on it, it really doesn't hold up well after more than a few listens. Simply put, it's background music at best.Worth having in your collection to have some knowledge of the genre but doesn't make me want to go out and explore anymore of the bands on here."
4,"The Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 1","This ablum is really good, for any dance or kick back. Most of the most are instremental."
3,"Good, But Not Nearly Good as the New ""Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3""","Don't get me wrong, this is a good album. But the Tijuana-based DJ collective doesn't live up to the name 'Nortec' (a fusion of norteno and techno) on this 2001 debut. This album felt more like a regular electronica album made by some musicians who just happened to be Mexican. Thankfully, the boys took their time and came back with the downright genius ""Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3"", which is far better. Vol. 3 far exceeds this album because you can really hear the norteno influence integrated with the electronica. In sum, skip this record and pick up the new one!"
4,great backyard bbq music with a teqila twist,i bought this after hearing it once on KROQ radio station and ihavent been sorry. be open to different beats moves and grooves if you want to enjoy it...its good to know that our southern neighbors enjoy modern hip hop and can hybrid it with mexican cantina music....good stuff
4,The best tune is missing in this compilation,"This is almost the same album you can get here in Mexico, only they crippled out ""Trip to Ensenada"". Get that if you can! It's the climax of this compilation!. Other than that, this album is excellent if you're looking for a new approach to techno. Nortec just doesn't dissapoint too many people, and I believe many of you, readers, that have visited our country will find something familiar in its sounds. De México para el mundo."
4,After this album music will never be the same,"I first heard Nortec in some now defunct Spanish Mtv channel that was called MtvS back in 2001. The video that I saw was the one for the track ""Polaris"". Quite honestly, I believe that what I felt at the time must have been the exact same feeling people felt when they first heard Jimi Hendrix back in 1967. My ears and eyes were taken to an audio/visual sensation that had been non-existent up to that point. First of all, being Mexican myself and from the Northern part of the country (although I was raised in Texas), Banda and Norteño music is something that was pretty common to me. What blew me away about the Nortec Collective is that it sampled and digitally processed a particular genre of Mexican musical folklore and turned it into a very relevant element of contemporary electronic music. The Tijuana Sessions: Vol. 1 is without a doubt a milestone that will be talked about as a before and after reference point in music history."
3,Yes for the price it's a good pickup.,"I'm not going to explain what the music is like in many words. Just that it's a fun SCI-FI score. And yes it is worth getting. But don't pay too much for it. Anything above 15 dollars is too much. I've seen film scores like this one that have been as high as 500 dollars, like Dante's Peak, what we're they thinking!? So yes if you like Graeme Revell get it, it's not extremely packed with action cues but it's still a good buy. I'll say this; it's better than you think."
1,Bad Disc for Columbo,We were half way through our second disc last night when it froze & then filled half the screen with pink pixels. Guess we will see how to replace it. V. Van Ry
5,Best Detective of all Time,Colombo is so awesome. It has been a few years since I had watched the episodes from the first season. It seems that the networks and cable television only play certain episodes and usually the same ones over and over again. Now I have a great collection to watch whenever I choose. I never get tired of Colombo. He is the best and is very sly even though he pretends that he is not. There has not been anyone like him before or after.
2,Poor transfer / or DVD's,"I hate to give this a poor review, but I ordered the first season with full intention of eventually ordering all the Columbo seasons on DVD.But when I watched the 5 disc's from season 1, disc #2 and #5 would constantly freeze and pause and could not be watched. My DVD player is less than a year old and of very good quality, so I dont think it's the player causing the problem, plus I recently bought the entire Twilight Zone collection (28 dvd's with no viewing problems), Amazon was great in exchanging my Columbo DVD set with no questions or shipping charges and I got it ASAP. But sorry to say the second set had even more problems with freezing and pausing."
5,timmel,"I bought this for my grandmother, because she has always loved Columbo. I think everyone is enjoying this. Great Amazon transaction. She loves it! I'm already looking to buy another season for her."
5,watch out bad guys,"I didn't care for tv programming, so I bought season onenow I get another every so oftenjust one more thing . . ."
5,"Well, it looks like the set will contain...","All 7 first season episodes, as well as the pilot ""Prescription: Murder"" and the ""Ransom for a Dead Man"" episode/movie as well for 9 total episodes/movies. YEAH!!!"
4,good vintage columbo,"i had never seen the early episodes so i was expecting an older columbo from the later episodes that i remember. obviously early in the character's evolution, and the episodes seem to move pretty slow compared to today's fast-paced programming. but once you slow down and get used to it, it's more charming than boring. good stuff."
5,"""A Lady In Waiting"" has Barbara Rhodes in it.","The person who wrote, saying, Barbara Rhodes wasn't in the episode of ""A Lady In Waiting"", on this DVD release, should have his eyes checked, she sure is in that episode, on this DVD release, she's the hostess, at the beauty salon."
5,You've Got To See to Believe,"As a big Columbo fan, I can't tell you how great it is to watch an episode, from beginning to end with no commercials and no cut scenes! Plus the quality is 100 times better than regular TV. I'd buy the entire series today if it were available. One more thing......"
3,I second the comments from Australia!,"Reviewer: A viewerI heartily second the sentiments of the previous commentary..""Universal has done the same thing to Columbo that they did to The Night Gallery series-no interviews,no documentaries and no remastering of the print. This is not good enough.""Again the point made of ""an interview with Peter Falk and have him tell us about his movie career and his 30 year association with Columbo,which is one of the longest acting experiences in media history"" is absolutely how I feel.Let's hope Universal DOES get this feedback, and includes these delightful and interesting ideas on the next season's release!!I've been waiting and hoping for this collection on DVD and can't wait to receive the first season. Hopefully, the rest of the episodes will soon follow."
5,The Best of Television,"If reality shows represent the worst of television then surely Columbo represents the best of this medium. My husband gave this DVD set to me as a Christmas gift and we've watched it every night since! Outside of Lucy Ricardo, I can't think of a more beloved character that has ever graced the big or small screen. I mean,come on, almost every villian in the series finds themselves enamored with the affable and beguilingly brilliant Columbo. I hope ""beguilingly"" is a word...I encourage anyone reading this to purchase this DVD set so Universal will see fit to release the 2nd season on DVD next year."
5,"""Just one more thing""","Wow!!!! Finally, the storylines make sense! There are no more holes in the continuity of the plot! These are COMPLETE episodes! The image is clear and the sound is sharp! I am very pleased that I bought the first season collection! WHEN will the second season be available for purchase???? I am anxiously awaiting its release!!"
5,Excellent!!!,I'm a huge fan of Columbo and having the first complete season was a godsent! The first episodes were truly classics and showed Columbo at his best. Highly recommend for fans of Columbo or any detective TV shows. I look forward to getting the complete collection.
5,Oh btw...,I love it! A police officer that you love to like! A average Joe with above average intelligence! It is a must have for any Columbo fan! :)
4,5 stars for series. less a star for no extra content,"Columbo is awesome, If you are only slightly familiar with Columbo you will love this set. this is five star entertainment.my only problem is lack of extra material. there is none. It would be hard for them to find things to put on the DVD. It took them long enough just to get the rights to release the series. Even though I am very happy with this set, I wish they threw me some type of bone when it comes to bonus material."
5,Fun to watch,"We've always liked Peter Falk, but wish more seasons would be made available as soon as possible. Great, interesting show."
5,Unbelievably funny!,"Released in 1991, album number 10, 76 Bad Loans is another example of the abundant talent Capitol Steps possesses. Combining the male and female voices in this album was pure genius.Loaded with exceptional quick wit and humor, the parodies contained on this album captures the political headlines of the day, these guys never miss a beat. The load both barrels and they are deadly accurate.Acclaimed by the Washington Post as Washington's favorite political cabaret troupe, Capitol Steps leave no doubt in my mind why this is so. Over 23 tracks allow every listener to have a great time.Another album for the collection, with songs like ""Atsa Lawyer, Wolf Blitzer - Scud Stud, Don't Know much about strategy and ending with the famous Lirty Dies segment, you have a ball listening to this cd over and over again."
4,Inexpensive and cute,"Lots of fun shapes, arrived in a cute little container. They're plastic, so probably won't last forever, but I knew that going in, and they were a good price. And, since they're Easter themed, it's not like I'll be using them year round. Just as described, and did what I needed them to - i used them to cut bread for finger sandwiches. Would order again."
3,cookie cutters,"A bit disappointed that they aren't a bit deeper other than that, for the price, they do the job. I was going to use them for rice krispee treats but they wouldn't work. They were not deep enough or sturdy enough. I won't keep them, will pass them on the my grandkids for fun."
5,The best training book that I have ever read!!!!! Bar-None,This was the most complete and knowledgeable training guide that I have ever read. I lost my copy and am currently trying to find a new one.
3,outdated,"At the time it was written it was the most logical way to train. Nautilus is still the best equipment to use, but books such as Body by Science will teach you that any training more than once a week, for 12 minutes, will not allow your muscles to recover and grow stronger at the fastest rate possible."
5,VERY IMPORTANT BOOK!,"Simply an outstanding book. Peter Nabakov has collected an impressive array of first-hand testimonials of Native people in one readable and very important volume. Chapters range from prophecies of various Peoples stretching thousands of years before European contact to responses and testimonies of Native people today. Many books in this vein focus on historical 'quotable quotes,' whereas this book is far greater in both depth and breadth. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Native Peoples, Native histories and Native issues."
5,GIVES THE REAL STORY,"Native American Testimony is one of the best books I have ever read regarding the real history of the native peoples. It tells of the first meeting of the white man through the present. This is all from the Native American perspective. All tribes are represented throughout this book showing the different expereinces they each had with the white man. And the white mans need to change a beautiful culture. This book should be read by everyone at some point in there life, it should be mandatory within the school system as well. It shows the strength these people had to survive and how they fought for there rights. I enjoyed this book because for the first time in my life I felt I was being told the truth about the relationship of the US government and the Native Americans. Past to Present."
1,Derivative and Dull,"Without a doubt, one of the weakest of the Elfquest volumes and most of the new stuff they've published since ending the original story line in the 1980's has been weak indeed. I count this series among the worst I've ever read and I only continued buying EQ because I was so loyal to the old series.If you thought the Star Wars chapter one was derivative and unimaginative, this book will leave you catatonic. Warring alien factions take a few chapters out of A Distant Soil, only without the intelligent scripts. The art is perfectly lousy. This stuff is rough and downright homely. No other publisher would print this and try to pass it off as professional quality.Maybe if Wendy Pini would get off her butt and actually produce something new, we wouldn't have to look at WARP Graphic's never ending list of fifth rate fill ins. I don't care if WARP is busy working on a movie and they can't produce a decent comic any more. I don't even want to see the movie at this rate."
2,Artificial Christmas tree review,was disappointed and I thought I should have done more shopping-the tree sheds its needles-not very full looking- definitely a Charlie Brown christmas tree- slightly difficult to install- and I received the wrong size from the seller which is another problem- maybe the 6 foot tree looks better than the 5 foot tree- its better to go to a store and see firsthand. I was overall very unhappy.
4,only crappy music ever gets recognition,"i heard glass case cello vase watching but i'm a cheerleader( which is an awesome movie by the way) if you go to yahoo LAUNCH and get your own radiostation, it's free, you can search for tattle tale and miraculously they have it then on the rating button rate on a scale of how much you love them and they'll play their songs for you at any given time."
5,Sew True??,"So I have spent a decent amount of time trying to find a way to get this CD, and so far no luck. Can anyone recommend where I might find a copy or anyone willing to sell? Any help would be very much appreciated! Thanks so much!!"
2,disappointed,"I had expected a lot more of this computer. Many of the programmes installed give more problems than pleasure (Media Center; Help and Support; and more). I am afraid that I cannot reccommend a better product, for lack of knowledge, but DO think twice before buying this computer unless you want a lot of headache."
5,An Excellent Book !!!,"I really enjoyed this book. The author describes real couples dealing with real issues in their relationships and works with them to achieve a deeper sexual expression and intimacy. I particularly liked how the author didn't tell his patients how to feel or what to do. He was very skilled at telling people ""It's your decision what you do with your life"", not what I expected!!! It reminded me of another book I recommend: ""Working on your Relationship Doesn't Work"" by Ariel and Shya Kane. The Kanes approach is that where you are RIGHT NOW is the perfect place to have your relationship (and your life) transform into the magical experience that is your birthright. Buy both books."
2,Passionate Marriage,"While the author's knowledge and ideas are on the plus side, his free use of crude and rude...and just plain filthy...language leaves me wondering why a man with a PhD and the years of experience he has must resort to ""gutter talk"" to make points about relationships.Due to this, I found myself unable to share it with my wife and just threw the book in the trash....which is, I'm afraid, where it belongs."
1,Junk,I listened to several sections of the CDs and thought it was junk. I do not recommend it for anyone. I threw mine in the trash.
3,Ok but it's not easy,to make time for love while you're draining the swamp and mothering and careering so I recommend for a look at love read about Elise in Defenders of the Holy Grail and see that it can happen but it is NOT so easy.
5,Crucial information for any person who wants to grow.,"Crucial information for any person who wants to grow emotionally (mature)in their ability to cope with life and relationships. While the reading requires effort, the content is enthralling. Dr Schnarch writes this book for the lay person, however his writing style is still that of his highly educated profession. Do Not let this deter you from reading it, though. He packs a huge amount of information and learning into each page. Moreover, the manner in which he writes compels you to continue turning the page and climbing the mountain toward greater understanding of your self, your mate and the dynamics of the committed relationship. His use of everday couples as examples of his point or the lesson, eases your ability to apply the point/lesson to your own situation and growth. Highly recommended. I am grateful for the things I have already started applying to myself and the success I have created. Thanks Dr Schnarch."
4,Keeping love,"It's about resolving the issues in a relationship in a way that results in great sex, rather than the other way around.I love about this book is that it isn't just about having great sex/chemistry/passion in general but about having those things with your partner.The perfect match with this book isI Love You. Now What?: Falling in Love is a Mystery, Keeping It Isn't"
2,Too wordy,"Needed more action rather than words. Too clinical and not practical. Had some good explanations, but my fiance and I just got bored with his suggestions. Has a lot to do with changing your thought process, but then what?"
3,Not what I'd hoped for.,"I think this book is improperly titled. I think it is more of a sex manual than a guide to helping you keep your passion and love alive in a marriage, which is what I'd hoped for."
4,Excellent Book!,This is an excellent book. My wife and I enjoyed reading it. David Schnarch has impressed us!
2,Some Sound Advice Some Not,The author is reasonably practical but obtuse at times. The author also writes from a world view that I don't appreciate. He treats gays and lesbians as legitimate couples and lost credibility with me because of this. [Note that Amazon censored this review the first time I made this statement]. Amazon's founder gave a record $2.5 million to help pass the same-sex marriage law in the state of Washington.
3,Takes patience/persistance to get through it.,"The message of the book is very good, however, it took great consentration on my part to read it. The author could have greatly simplified his verbiage to get his ideas across. Like in the movie, ""A River Runs Through It""; the dad is teaching his son to write. His son comes to him with his written story several times. Each time, his father says, ""Good. Now use HALF as many words."" I wish I could say it changed my life, but at least it opened the door to new understanding. My advice is: Go to the ultimate professional for advice and guidance concerning keeping your love & intimacy alive in your marriage - God. Ask Him to grow new love and desire between you and to reveal & break down the barriers that have prevented it."
3,passionate marriage,"This book is pretty big and thick. I am not sure I was ready for.that. However, I am not one for reading forwards. They always seem dry and boring. My husband convinced me to read this one and I was happy I did. It was neither dry nor boring. The reason for the 3 stars is because I am either too busy or too lazy to get myself to actually keep reading it. I have read one chapter. It just seems too daunting a task at bed time and I don't want to read it unless I can focus and absorb. I give it 3 stars because it isn't ""fun"" to read. But, the material and concepts within seem sound and usable."
2,Very disappointing,"I found this book to be misleadingly named and described, even considering the rave reviews. It's a highly conceptual and philosophical discussion on the nature of love, marriage, relationships, etc. and, while I agree with most of his observations, most of them seem common sense and not very surprising. And the writing is redundant and dense. Despite expressing his thoughts in numerous ways, the authors' points often are still not clearly expressed. This book could have been compressed into two-thirds of the pages. The numerous examples he provides of couples he has treated are of people who seem incredibly immature and dysfunctional. If you're a reasonably well-adjusted, mature person simply looking to spice up a longer-term relationship, you won't find much help here."
1,Passionate Marriage,"As a woman I personally did not find this book helpful at all. I bought it several years ago and found the author to be incredibly egotistical. To me it overemphasized the sexual aspect of marriage when I was starving for emotional intimacy. I wonder whether the previous reviewers were just patting each other on the back for being ""self-differentiating"". I can't remember whether I gave it away or threw it in the trash to prevent anyone else from suffering from it."
4,Very informative!,"I believe this a great book for couples. It is straight talk for our modern world, with a lot of great information. My only concern was it lacked a discussion of spirituality with-in the sexual realm of relationships."
2,Reads like a voyeuristic therapist sex logs.,"This book just plan sucks. Schnarch used clients to pen his volume that reads more like progress notes, then a guide. A colleagued mentioned this work in passing to give to clients, and believe me it would be the last book i would suggest if as a therapist you want to help a client and their spouse improve passion. From my perspective his diatribe is a self aggrandisement of how he treated clients feeding his ego and not truly giving directions..Making a passionate marriage is not what this book is about.. It is about Mr Schnarch feeding his ego about saving 5 marriages.. Big friggin' woop.Don't buy this book, unless you are a therapist. And Even then don't pay full price for an over priced paper weight.,"
3,"Helpful, but dense","The concepts of emotional fusion and differentiation were very helpful as were some of the recommended techniques for overcoming unhealthy dynamics of emotional fusion. The book certainly helped me understand the destructive dynamics of some of my relationships. Unfortunately, the writing is very, very dense and difficult to read. There's also a lot of unnecessary repetition. Overall, I would buy the book again but would also be more willing to skim all but the first 5 chapters."
3,whoa whoa whoa...let's be realistic,"if anything i feel compelled to lower the average rating of this album, simply because it isn't THAT good. but, yes, as a testament to minimalism, ""Parking Lot Music"" stays above water throughout its 45-minute running time, if only barely. two songs (""What We Meant"" and ""To Scale A Fish"") intrigued enough to inquire second listens; after a few times through, it became apparent that ""Parking Lot Music"" hasn't much in itself to indicate the more elaborate, altogether more enjoyable reverberations of, say, Oval or early, quieter Aphex Twin, but in it being an album you'll probably never have the urge to listen to with headphones on (the only true assertion of musical awesomeness), throw this album on with a group of people over and all is sure to be well."
5,Wonderfully healing self help book,"I am really enjoying this book. It's not a book that you just read and put away. I guess you could, yet, it wouldn't be as helpful. It's an interactive book. You actually work in it. It explains so much about our patterns and why we have developed them. It really makes a lot of sense, and clears up why I react the way I do to certain situations as well as why I react to certain situations with my children in the way that I do, and have all their lives. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to heal, and have a better understanding of themselves."
3,Some people in Washington are confused.,"This CD was recorded live in late 1994 and early 1995 at Chelsea's Cabaret in Washington, DC. It features topical, political song parodies. It is pretty funny, but the problem is that it's so topical, that's it's very dated now."
3,COLOR ERROR ON PRODUCT,"Options in selection, and picture, said colonial white, pix WAS white. This item is closer to yellow. Complaint to seller had a reply that THAT WAS colonial white and that I should have made a different selection as to color....there was no other white to be selected. Nuff said"
2,What TH......,I think this movie was a victim of bad editing.It seemed like the was more going on than what we we watching but how could you be sure.Its too old for me to recommend even though the plot sounded good. Save your money and rent Un faithful.
5,Protecting traditions - Surviving deserts - Understanding,"Tuareg is a really really well written story about a Tuareg inmouchar (venerable leader, somewhat below a Prince among the Tuareg) whose life is turned upside down as he sets out to avenge the abuse of his guests, protected by the millennia-old laws of hospitality and tradition of his people, when the world outside his desert comes to claim them back. With him we drink of the Sahara desert, ""The land to be crossed"". Together we surprise his enemies in his crusade to restore his honour. We learn to survive within ourselves in this beautiful, unforgiving and misunderstood expanse of the world."
5,Al mejor estilo Wilbur Smith,Excelente obra literaria que lo llebara a conocer como vive la gente el descierto; y a comprender como pueden amar simplemnete ese mar de arena.
5,Great low key music,"Was skeptical about this record at first, but these guys are solid. Perfect for late night drives or sitting around on a Sunday. Fans of Keane or The Fray will dig this album."
4,Very Good experimental progressive rock,"These guys were always supporting groups like Magma, Art Zoyd, Etron Fou Leloublan and Univers Zero during concerts in France back in the day when they were active (end of 70's). Great compositions in that dark and almost frenetic and hectic style of prog rock know as RIO (rock in opposition) with lots of flute, vibraphone, electric bass, drums, keys, acoustic and electric guitars. Should be very pleasing to anyone familiar with any of the bands mentioned."
3,OLD STYLES REVAMPED,"In their best effort so far, Los Aterciopelados mellow out, even though their songs remain typically trippy. The best feature of the album, besides it's superb production and clever song writing, is their reinterpreting their musical roots, which include tango, bolero, and others, and reinventing them for electric bass, electric guitars and hip-hop rythms (although this is no hip hop album). For once, I am beginning to like Echeverry's gruff vocals too."
4,Mistic yet Rocking rythms...Pipa de la Paz still #1,The album it's self has few rocking tracks. Most of the tracks are either mistical and hypnotic. But hey if you feel mistical and hypnotic some days its the album for you. The best songs are Caribe Atomico y Estuche.
5,AUTHENTIC URBAN MUSIC EXPERIENCE,"This is an example of how daily life in Bogota is....In a vicarious way. Wild, raw, fun, insightful. A metropolis like Bogota is hard to understand or portrait... But they got it! This is an exellent way for someone to break sterotypes from what a latinoamerican experience might be.Thanks to these artists and their lirics I'm still have a bit of Bogota with me."
4,Spidey!,Nice sized Spiderman plush - perfect for young children to play and sleep with. The toy is not stuffed well and has wire in the arms and legs.
3,Good lights for some quick decent looking track lighting.,"I bought these lights to replace the chandelier in my dining room when I smashed my head into it and broke a couple of the crystal sconces when I was trying to clean it. Well, whatever, so I bought a couple strings of these cheap lights to replace it and pretend I was trying to update the look of the dining room too. The lights are ok, work as they should, but are basically Ikea grade, which is good for the cost but nothing special otherwise."
1,this thing sck,I bought one of these kits and i thought u could plug it in. but nope it needs a junction box which i have no clue where to find.
3,Not Required,"The way the Messermeister Knife Roll was described on the website, it wasn't obvious that it came with a shoulder strap. So I bought the strap thinking that I need one. However, when I got my knife roll, it came with one. I didn't bother sending it back. It wasn't very expensive and I didn't want to spend the time dealing with it. I'll find another bag or use for it. I only gave it three stars due to the fact that it isn't required when buying the knife roll. Amazon shouldn't offer it in the ""buy the two together"" section of the website if the knife roll already comes with one."
4,More Comments,"This toy is cute, but large. I prefer the size of the mini Mr. Wonderful. Also, for the size of this doll, it would be nicer if there were a lot more ""Mr. Wonderful"" comments. There are only about six or seven comments."
4,Stability is the most important issue in power systems.,This book is very helpfull in analyzing and understanding the stability problem of power systems. I wish all interested readers have a look on this book.
2,Too bad quality,"I am from Colombia and I am studing a PhD in Brazil. This book looks like a bad photocopy, its not originally impression.It looks like a latin's pirate copy. I am very disgust and disappointment.Este libro no es una impresión original de Mc Graw Hill. Mas bien parece una vulgar fotocopia pirata como las de nuestros paises latinos. Me siento engañado."
5,good book,"Kind of the bible for the stability world... great book, lots of information. great for reference or for starting out in the power industry."
5,A great comprehensive book in Power Systems,"It's a really great reference book in the advanced topics of power systems, specially from control point of view."
1,never received my book,"i ordered this book like 2 months ago before school started and i never received it. so i had to go to the student store and buy it new for like 130 dollars, after already paying 30 for the used one i never received."
4,Good Pan,Used this pan for my family recipe pound cake and it baked nicely. A true test as it was a cake made many times before.
5,SWEET!,How many times have I had to clean the oven after a pound cake ooooozzzzzed out while baking? Too many. Now I am not hesitant to bake while my oven is clean. It will stay clean. The pan bakes great!
5,AWESOME!!!,My mom loves to bake. She bakes several cakes a year and she wanted to upgrade the pound cake pan she already had so we decided to purchase this one and she's been using it ever since.
1,Absolutely Ridiculous.,I ordered this pan in hopes of making a pound cake for Thanksgiving. Received that pan today (3 days before Thanksgiving) and there is a large gash that goes through the wall of the pan. Absolutely ridiculous and needless to say I am returning and NOT reordering. If I wanted shoddy craftsmanship I would have ordered the $15 pan not the $30 one.
3,My Long Awaited Pound Cake Pan,"I finally found the cake pan that I have wanted because of size and quality, but when I received it, it had a flaw on the inside wall. I returned the pan with instructions that I wanted a replacement. What I received was a refund. Therefore, I will have to re-order. Very frustrating, because of the inconvenience."
5,Excellent Pan,"Made my first chocolate pound cake with this pan. Have had other pans stick, but this cake slid out perfectly. It's not a heavy pan, but substantial and bakes evenly. This was definitely one of my best purchases - worth every penny."
5,"Awesome candy, great vendor","Bit O Honey is one of the best old time candies, hard to find at stores, thank god for online vendors"
1,1/2 order,ordered 2received 1sent e mail to make you aware of problemreceived acknowledgement of my emailnever heard againguess i'm screwed out of my order ???
3,"Came without the necessary 8"" X16"" practice sheets!","Beautiful book, but you are advised to have (their spelling) ""A very diseful additional tool"" --- 120 color coded practice sheets that are to be used apart from the book. Not here, and you can't get them on the web. The publisher, John Wiley, is not up front about this. Shame on them.The sheets are produced in mini version on the book's pages. You could xerox them, I suppose. It's a major annoyance, though."
3,"Interesting, but...","Being a huge fan of TMV i bought this single for Bible & the Breathalyzer thinking it's some unreleased song. I had no expectations of it being as good as Fraces the Mute on the Widow single but wanted to check it out. I was pretty dissapointed to find that B&B is just a spoken word track, Cedric is an extremely unique writer, but i really was hoping for some new tasty licks. Other than that L'Via is a totally bitchin' song and the video is frickin' frackin' wild."
4,A Scholarly Graphic Novel,"The beginning of this book seemed promising, and I particularly loved the author's father's penchant for Victorian decorating. She spends a lot of time describing the decor in the rooms of the house, and how much it stood out from the houses of her friends. The story is very much about the father, who she never really knew during his life, and has quested to discover after his mysterious death. Bechdel examines many minute details of conversations with her father, and the way their relationship paralleled those of characters in the novels he loved.Fun Home is well-written and entertaining, but I did not have an emotional connection to the characters because I did not relate to them. They were amusing, but what I read did not resound with me."
5,highly recommended reading,you will find yourself laughing and crying simultaneously. Her work is unparalleled in comic drama. this autobiography is so sad and yet totally uplifiting at the end!
5,A Family Tragicomic,"Loved this. My reading group will be reading this one!! She's bright, intelligent and I hope we can expect more from Alison Bechdel.Was very surprised when I received this book to see that it was in ""comic form."" The illustrations were superb as well as the content of the novel."
3,"Great Art, Okay Book",I will say right now that my rating is in between because I do enjoy the art work.This book was recommended to me by who I can't remember. Although I like graphic novels I probably would not have read it but only did because of the recommendation.I respect very much the art work and the story she is trying to tell but for it was not that interesting. Maybe not that it wasn't interesting but the view point and the literature references were just over my head or not the way I would have gone. It is not my story to tell though.Although Miss Bechdel may have found some therapeutic instrument in telling her story. Too many books mentions that I didn't know or in parts the story seemed so dark I did not enjoy. So while I think the art is great but the moments told in this memoir are only okay.
2,wish I had gotten it at the library,"This work was well-drawn, as is all of Bechdel's work. It was also incredibly boring, kind of aimless, self-absorbed catharsis. I also thought we'd get to know more about her father's life, thoughts, feelings...along with hers.I love her other stuff, but this rambling tome just wasn't for me."
2,A MINORITY VIEW,"The book was disappointing. It lacked all sense of wonder and discovery because Bechdel tells us her father was gay early on and once acknowledged, it's hard to believe there was ever a time when she didn't know. Her explorations into lesban life are equally flat-- much like her ongoing saga of ""Dykes to Watch Out For"" in which lesbianism seems (at best) an immature emersion into masturabation and oral sex between women."
5,Totally Unique,"A lot of Fun Home was way over my head and it took a certain dedication to contend with words like ""postlapsarian"" and cerebral personal parallels with great classics I've never read. Which really seemed to highlight the intimate, authentic, organic tone of Alison's story. Unlike many reviewers, I took my time and savored it for the fantastic artistry. Sometimes I would flip back and casually review each page, looking for details I missed, never in a hurry. Everyone should own this book. I guarantee you've never seen one like it."
5,Fantastic,"my jaw was literally on the floow when i read Alison Bechdel's Fun Home -- more than once, sometimes for eloquence, sometimes for recognition, sometimes just because i was finally reading a comic book i could relate to. brilliant decision to illustrate and tell her story this way, i'd give this book to anyone who is grown up and might have had even a sliver of a similar experience."
3,Intelligent and Admirable,"This is a personal journey, a coming of age story that deals with some extreme personalities. Unfortunately, the illustrations don't make up for the lack of emotional appeal."
5,Tragically Good,"This graphic novel is amazing.It is a memoir graphic novel, following Alison Bechdel's life before and after her father's suicide.The novel is rife with literary allusions (the very first page alludes to a Greek myth of Icarus and Daedalus) and depth.I'm not ""a comic book person,"" but this clearly shows the future of graphic novels as strong, eloquent, moving and brilliant.Bechdel is famous for good reason."
5,As you can see from all the reviews,"this is a GLORIOUS book, with wonderful drawings, elegant English, and a story which--no matter how different it is from your own---you will immediately identify with. What are you waiting for?"
2,...,"It felt as if I was tied to an anchor, being dragged down to the bottom of a cold, cold ocean. And, on the sandy floor, I drowned in the darkness."
2,not what I expected,Maybe I didn't look clsely enough when I ordered this book.....I didn't realize that it was in comic book style......stopped reading it after the first few pages.
4,Fine book; don't buy the Kindle edition,"Why? Because many of the pages have text that, in the Kindle edition, is too small and dim to read. Even with a magnifying glass! Unfortunately a lot of indecipherable passages come late in the book and make the ending--to me, at least--incomprehensible."
3,Intriguingly anti-melodic,"3 1/2Influential avant-rockers fall squarely between stimulatingly off-kilter and obnoxiously untraditional, with a morbid sense of informed composition ensuring listeners see the former more clearly."
3,Only okay for it's genre,"I found this book to be only an OK book. It is definitely in the Christian romance genre. I didn't think it was particularly well written. To be honest, I only finished it to see how it would end, which was fairly predictable. It might be good for young adult fiction, but definitely not beyond that."
5,Great book to find all basic topics on reservoir engineering,"I've seen that all topics on reservoir engineering have been covered in sufficient detail and very systematically. I strongly reccommed the book to those looking for a starting book on reservoir engineering and to those who, after a while, got lost among SPE papers and specialized books to come back to the backbone of the issue."
3,A bit scientific,What I have read of this book so far seems a little scientific. I thought it would be a bit more practical.
4,satisfied,"I had some problems with my book that the seller could not have foreseen, but they were quick to fix my problems. I would purchase through them again."
2,Color or b/w,"Does this release actually contain a color version of MANFISH ? Shown on British TV in the 70s in color, a few DVD releases of this film are usually in b/w. Amazon product description says it is color. Anyone bought this yet and can confirm the image of MANFISH."
4,Finally....,"This has been a long time coming. This was once released in VERY limited quanities and was always a prize to be found on places like eBay.When I first saw Disney was re-releasing many of their original soundtracks, the first thing I wondered was ""Would the Rescuers and Rescuers Down Under be involved?"" Well, low and behold, you get RDU, and a few songs from the original Disney classic as well.An excellent soundtrack that creates a perfect feel of Australia with trademark sounds and instruments to create that ""Down Under"" feel.The tracks from the original movie are are great and very welcome touch on the CD. It shows some great vocal work from the late 70's that really shined in the classic film.This is my all-time favorite Disney movie, and finally the soundtrack can be added to my collection."
2,I agree with previous customers!,"The first The Rescuers film had the most charming and soothing tunes, that one should have had a soundtrack released way before this one. It is obvious the Disney studios felt the need to add songs from the original classic film in order to boost sales, and the three songs they added are the real reason as to why you should buy this CD. Unfortunately, The Rescuers had more songs and much better melodies than the sequel, so naturally I expected Disney to know better.Disappointed. 1.9/5"
5,SACD VS. XRCD24 versions of Hell or High Water.,"The high resolution SACD version blows away the XRCD24 version. I own both. Simply put, this Sara K album will become your reference CD -- she is that good and Stockfish has produced a product that matches Sara's talent. But when comparing different recordings -- while the XRCD24 is excellent, the SACD hybrid recording blows away the XRCD24 -- it is that good. Plus, the SACD hybrid has a high resolution stereo AND multichannel version as well as being able to be played back on a standard CD player in stereo. If you do not own this Sara K album BUY IT NOW. If you do buy one then BUY THE SACD hybrid disc. You will be getting the best of both worlds -- the standard AND high resolution formats in a single disc."
4,Interesting Read,"If you need a fast way to get the basics of wirebonding, this book is a straight-forward, very readeable text. It references several papers if you want to read more on a particular section, but does a very good job summarizing available industry data."
3,So many typos!,"This book is decent as a reference book but it rather dense for someone who is learning the material the first time. (I'm using this book for a graduate course after having seen much of the material as an undergraduate and it's still a little difficult to read.)It also has an inexcusable amount of typos in it. By the third edition, this really shouldn't be a problem."
1,Misleading Title,"This book is NOT an introduction!!This book is NOT an introduction!!If the portait of Mona Lisa is put 10 feet away in front of you, you see a beautiful picture. If the portait of Mona Lisa is put 2 inches away in front of you, you see chunks of paint. This book puts the portrait of Mona Lisa 2 inches away in front of you. As the result, you see chunks of paint.If you are taught one thing each day, you learn one thing every day. After a year, you have learned 365 things. If you are taught 1000 things each day, you learn nothing every day, and after a year, you have learned nothing! This book tries to teach you 1000 things each day. As the result, you learn nothing.Reading this book is a waste of time. The few things you can learn is not worth the confusion.Yes, it might be a good reference. But for an introduction, find another book!"
5,excellent transaction,"I love diagnosis murder, wish they had more seasons released. it has 5 movies on it they are all great."
2,Kensington Monitor Stand,Both items arrived scratched on top. The items looked as though they were used as the silver finish is worn though and you can see black streaks and marks. Terrible finish. Also items are not really adjustable unless you pull them apart; maybe not even then.
4,Spin Station helps with Organization,"This Computer Monitor Stand is just the item to organize many things you need at an arm's length on your desk. This version of the Spin Station is smaller and doesn't hold as much as the one I purchased 2 years ago. However, it looks sleeker than the older one because it is black and silver as opposed to dark gray and clear plastic. Took about 2 weeks to arrive."
5,Monitor Stand,This is a good device for a bedroom TV. It can spin to the bed and then to a desk. Good value for the money. I would recommend to a friend.
5,Perfect for my needs,"I needed to have my Dell monitor more at eye level due to the fact that most of the monitors today lack height adjustment, unless you go to the higher end models. Eye level is what is ergonomically correct. Many of the monitor stands I looked at appeared to take up too much desk space. Since I have a Dell monitor with a round pedestal stand, this Kensington Spin2 was perfect. It's just slightly larger than my monitors base, which makes for a perfect fit. I haven't tried to adjust the height because it was just right out of the box. The storage carousel in the bottom is a nice touch to throw little things. Now I'm not hunched over staring down at my monitor getting back aches."
1,not exactly what I thought it would be,"From the write up on the web site I had a different impression of what this book would be. I've been playing ukulele for a while and was hoping to learn some neat transitions and additions to the regular chords. NOT HERE IN THIS BOOK. Despite what the write up might say, there is nothing here that you won't find on a chord chart. Chords and chord variations I can play. That's all that is in this book. Save yourself the money and just use a chord finder on the internet."
3,I can hardly hear the harpsichord,"This should be a great recording. Marianne Ronez & Ernst Kubitschek are both extraordinary musicians playing first rate instruments in an outstanding recording space. These same two musical partners did such a fine job on Biber's Mystery Sonatas, in the same recording space for the same Winter and Winter label, which I would recommend to anyone. But this one fails for only one reason, the mic is too far from the harpsichord. Marianne's violin tone is extraordinary as usual, if only Ernst's harpsichord could be heard. On the aforementioned Biber, Ms. Ronez is accompanied by Chamber Organ and Theorbo, not harpsichord. Perhaps that accounts for it's far richer sound. This Bach has a thin flat sound to it. Most of the time I can hardly hear the harpsichord."
4,rocking folk from the heart,"Blue Mountain's take on American folk music is informed, passionate, and engaging. As any number of mediocre recordings have documented, folk music is a whole lot harder than it looks. To do it justice, to make it real, you have to get inside it and speak from its heart. Roots is music from the heart, and it never misses a beat. I'd heard every song but one (Bill Carlisle's ""That Nasty Swing"") in its traditional form, and the formidable competition notwithstanding, Blue Mountain has made each its own. It even manages to transform the old parlor ballad ""I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes"" (whose melody graces a number of subsequent country songs, most famously Hank Thompson's ""The Wild Side of Life"") into a rock-and-roll song, something I would not have imagined possible. The past year has seen two other memorable fusions of American folk and rock, by the Tarheel Ramblers and Dave Alvin. This CD holds its own in that esteemed company."
3,NOT A WIERD FOLKIE,The only thing missing in Blue Mountain's electric rendition of traditional folk songs is the giddy delerium one hears in the vocals of old folk records. There's something unsettling about a folk artist yodeling away as if from some other world. The lyrics here beg for such wierdness as whiskey and dead wives are spilled and chilled. This is very competant music bringing to life historic American music through anonymous vocals that may remain restrained out of reverence.
4,"cute chick flick, great actors","A cute chick flick. A little slow at times, but overall very sweet and funny. Love the actors in the movie. They definitely couldn't have pulled it off w/o them. Worth seeing on a Friday night if you just want to wind down and see something light."
5,Present for my mom,Bought this video for my mom as she collects Tom Hanks items. This one is for her for Christmas. Anything that Tom Hanks is in has always been great to watch.
2,For the acting,"Big fan of JR and TH -I had a hard time with this one... ... They tried to make it into a comedy, that might have been the mistake. Do not expect to laugh, there isn't one laughter here....Comedies are tough to write, this movie could have been a great light drama if there was a story...I think the movie also lost some quality points with their choice for the cast.The movie started really strong... Then stretched towards the middle.... then the momentum was totally lost. TH is a brilliant actor, that man can take on any role and turn into a chef d'oeuvre... what a waste of talent. I was detached and did not care a bit. I like JR so I kept watching, for watching.I actually did not finish it, I was very disappointed. Too bad, I still gave it a 2 because of the duo, but be ready for an average, forgettable OK movie."
1,Just aweful...,"It seems to be a pointless tale portraying students at community college in a poor light. It effectively shows how Larry Crowne is a complete dolt and how Julia Roberts character is a waste of air as a teacher. It is meant as a love story except it lacks all chemistry, interest and spark. A monumental waste of time."
2,If it weren't for the names .....,"This movie is just not much fun. Not much romance to it either. I don't see how it can be classified as a romcom. (No, it doesn't need bedroom scenes) There was a happy ending, but the entire story fell flat. I watched it because of the stars, they just didn't add the pizzazz that they normally do."
2,The Movie was Awful How can the Book be Any Better?,"I saw the movie but I have not read the book. Having said that, the publishers used the movie poster for the book cover so I feel that I can legitimately comment. The characters are portrayed as losers living loser lives. The story ends on a downer. Yes, the two main characters end up together but with a pretty negative future. There is no aspiration for greatness or to better oneself or mankind. There is no uplifting message. If the book is like the movie, then I recommend passing. Spend your money on something else."
3,YAWN!,"If you liked Forest Gump, you'll love this movie. For me, however, it was a yawn. Recommended only for Tom Hanks fans. We only see so little of Julia Roberts, her fans should take a pass.Personally, I'm not a fan of Tom Hanks -- I'm tired of his good-guy persona. But this was on a weekend special, and I'd heard it was pretty good. It isn't -- certainly nowhere near a 4-star.It's so boring that I wanted to turn it off. Since I ""paid"" for the movie, I decided to see it through. It isn't worth even $1.99, maybe 99 cents."
1,one of the most formulaic boring movies ive ever witnessed,"so tom hanks (the most boring actor in hollywood) goes back to college, buys a vespa, tries to become young again, falls in love with his teacher, played by the most boring actress in hollywood (julia roberts). absolutely nothing original or unpredictable happens.if this is your idea of cinematic heaven, please go ahead and purchase. for those with intelligence, stay well clear."
3,Not quite a comedy,"I have found many movies labeled as comedies lately that are not funny in the least. Larry Crowne was a great movies, but definitely not a comedy. It was strictly a drama."
4,Trite but cute,"Larry Crowne is a pleasant escape from your own reality. While there are gaps in sensibility (caution - minor plot reveals here - like a college professor not knowing how many students are in a class until she walks in on the first day or someone dropping out of school the week before finals), they are not so bad as to distract from the charm inherent in a Tom Hanks movie. While I would have much rather seen Meg Ryan play the romantic interest for Mr. Hanks, Julia Roberts does an adequate job. I do, however, often find myself focusing on why people think she is so hot instead of watching her character develop on the screen. Overall, I'd watch this movie again. It's cute enough to hold my interest long enough to get through the whole film."
4,A bit too skimpy,"I enjoyed Larry Crowne very much. I loved the performances of Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks. I like how Julia Roberts portrayed a flawed rather brittle character. It was a nice change of pace.My only complaint about the movie was that it was skimpy in places, either due to the editing or a script with holes. For instance, there needed to be more scenes building up to the relationship between the Roberts character and the Hanks character. Also, there needed to be better explanation for why Larry decided to let his house go into foreclosure.Otherwise, the characterizations were great and the film was full of good humor."
2,Two stars for the cast.,"One, the first part, or basis for the plot of the movie was unbelievable and just dumb and ridiculous, even though the consequences of Hanks being fired were depressing and heartbreaking. But, the writers for this movie have no knowledge of what happens in the real world with employees that work for a giant corporation.Even though Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts are two of my favorite actors, a good or great movie needs a good story and good writing.After the first ten minutes of the movie I left the room, leaving my wife to continue watching. About 20 minutes after I left my wife turned the DVD off because, in her words, ""It was really stupid and unwatchable."""
2,Not very good..,"The movie was lacking on real character development, over-dramatized and just plain boring. Didn't like it all. My wife on the other hand thought it was okay - but wasn't thrilled either (proving it's not just gender-bias!)"
4,cute!,"Don't listen to those who slammed this movie; it's adorable! True, you may need to be over 30 to enjoy it, but to those of us who are, the movie was sweet and likable. Score, Tom Hanks! And for Julia: Much better choice of script than your other recent choices. ;)"
4,Nice warm-hearted comedy,The characters are so likable. They really make me want to suspend my sense of reality and watch the movie.
2,A Lump of Cliches - Bubble Gum for the Brain,"A movie filled with cliches. The only funny scene is the classroom scenes and those scenes are stolen by the ""class characters""...not Roberts or Hanks. I'm a fan of both, but this one fell WAY short. Rent ONLY if: you have nothing else in the movie pipeline and you need a Hanks/Roberts fix."
2,Not good.,"I like every movie Tom Hanks has ever been in, but this one just plain sucked. Frankly it's boring, and I just found myself not caring about anything that was happening. My wife who is an even bigger Hanks fan than me thought the same thing."
1,Too boring to finish...,"1. Tom Hanks is one of those slam-dunk good movie type of actors... until now. It just goes to show you that just because you're famous doesn't automatically translate into success. Furthermore, the basics of a good movie are always the same: good writing and good acting; unfortunately, this movie has neither. The summary of the movie seemed like a good plot but the actual movie never materialized on this potential theme.2. Another interesting thing about this movie is the semi-law that if you've never heard of the movie, it's probably lame. I have to hand it to the public on this one; this movie deserved every bit of nonrecognition it received.3. Bottomline: Even though you may be tempted to watch this movie because of the famous actors in it, do yourself a huge huge favor and spend your time... reading the phonebook because this movie is perhaps the most boring and tedious thing you'll ever do this year."
1,Larry Crowne,"Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts were once highly sought-after stars, both of them having won Academy Awards in the Best Actor and Best Actress categories, respectively, but neither of them has earned as much critical recognition lately as they used to. Enter Larry Crowne, a romantic comedy pairing up the Charlie Wilson's War co-stars, directed and co-written by Hanks. Here, the titular character is a recently downsized retail employee who decides to enroll in community college, where he meets various new friends and falls in love with his Public Speaking instructor. Unfortunately, while the film's two stars are certainly likeable and are able to maintain a relaxed chemistry, I found the story all too conventional and bland, earning Larry Crowne a mere one star. Fans of both stars may enjoy the film, but as it stands, it's a missed opportunity for two very capable powerhouse actors."
3,Used item is OK,"The used DVD sticks in the same place if played on a DVD player; however, if played on a computer it's fine. This is the first time I ever had to select a language each time I play the movie; usually, movies play english without subject titles. It's a little annoying but it is the first time I ordered a used DVD and I thought something might be wrong with it; so, in all I was disappointed."
2,a little movie in many ways,"little in acting, little in plot, little in writing, and little in directing. one thing was not so little, the unbelievability of the entire movie.as for hanks and roberts, nothing surprising about them; hanks has been this same character in too many movies, and robertsjust seems to exist in bad movies. here's a hint: if roberts is in the film, it will probably stink. no exception here."
5,Movie,"Just a fun movie, not a major work of theatrical art. Was fun to watch and would recommend to a friend."
5,Fun film,"This movie, while a pretty sad topic, manages to make you feel pretty good.Larry Crowne is your neighbor, best friend, brother, guy you met last week, whatever. You fill in the blank. This guy is the everyman.Larry is the kind of middleage guy that goes to work on time everyday not because it is his job, but because it is his life. I identify so much with this guy!This is the kind of man that makes lemonade when life hands him lemons.Just watch the film and relax!"
4,Larry Crowne,"This is a simple movie. I like Julia Robrrtd and Tom Hanks, but together they don't quite do it for me."
5,Great Fun Movie,A very enjoyable movie suitable for the romantics or the whole family. Tom Hanks gives a great performance with Julia Roberts and the match works well. Well worth a watch.
4,Really good movie!,"It was nice to see a movie like this, they are so rare anymore. A good movie to have in your collection!"
5,I love this Movie,Great Seller and wonderful Movie. I used this Movie in reference to my final catalog project for my InDesign class. The Adult College experience and the scooter world meet. The economy is hard and this is the story of a hard working dedicated guy who has his world flipped on its ear. Check it out great Movie.
2,Star Power Squandered,"No one can deny the effortless rapport between Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, but ""Larry Crowne"" (2011) emerges as a misguided vanity project. Hanks directed and co-wrote (with Nia Vardalos) this flat comedy-drama that plays like a TV Movie of the Week. Unlike ""Charlie Wilson's War"" (2007), both stars are woefully miscast."
3,Ok,"Entertaining and that's about it. Not impressed at all on the acting, story, dialogue. It was just entertaining. It makes a good free regular TV movie."
1,not interesting nor fun to watch,"I love Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, but this film just wasn't good. I did not like the characters or the story or the writing and it just was not fun or interesting to watch. sorry tom!"
1,Horrible,"I like both of the actors, but this is pathetic piece of work. Julia Roberts is horrible as her character and Hanks was over-the-top stupid and silly as are most of the characters. Ugh, I tried to finish it, but there is no way I can do that. Watch it if you dare."
1,Unbelievably bad.,"Beware.This is supposed to be a romantic comedy but it is not funny, not heart-warming, not believable, not tolerable.I got it free from my public library and now feel ripped-off that I had to use gas to drive to pick it up and return it. It's not even worth the energy it will take to rip open a Netflix envelope or the electricity it will take to download it to a computer. I only watched it all because my girlfriend kept saying that it had to get better. It never did. It got worse.Tom Hanks co-wrote and co-starred in this dog. He owes me two hours of my life back."
4,THANKS TOM!,"ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE, INTELLIGENT FILMS I'VE SEEN IN ALONG TIME. WOW, A MOVIE FOR GROWN UPS. IF YOU LIKE MOST OF THE DRIVEL THAT COMES OUT OF HOLLYWOOD, SKIP TO SOME OF VACUOUS COMEDYS THAT ARE AVAILABLE, AS IN MOST. NOT FOR MORONS!!!!!"
3,Middle aged and unemployed : New beginnings,"Larry Crowne has been laid off from Umart after working there for hte last many years. He has no college degree hence his chances of a future and a promotion are dim. What does he do? He enrolls in a class at the community college where the teacher is Miss Tainot ( Roberts) with pressing problems of her own. Somehow they bond together and all ends well.This is not a high brow film but I frankly expected more from the likes of Messrs Hanks and Roberts. More so because Hanks is credited with the script writing duties but many sequences will ring a bill with us in situations such as mid life crises, job loss, re-entry in the job market are struggles that many of us face every day."
4,Good price.,The price is unbeatable. The product is in good working condition. The only problem is that the metal parts of the plug is spread apart too much so it's hard to plug it in a socket.
1,"Absolute crap, doesn't even deserve 1 star","Don't buy this adapter!! The picture shown is not what you will receive, the picture shows a genuine Nokia adapter but what you get is a cheap piece of crap that doesn't even have the same specifications as the Nokia adapter. So if you don't want to fry your device, don't buy this."
3,Does the Job,I bought one of these for a back-up charger. Does the job.I prefer my tiny Nokia CA-100 USB charger though and use it the most.Works nice with my Nokia N95-3 phone and Nokia 800 Internet Tablet.
4,Nokia e71x/e71 Charger,"This isn't a really good product, the reason is for the end of the plug that connects into the mobile's charging port. It's very small and fragile, this is the 4th one I've had to buy within two year of owning the Nokia e71x. I am also a bit careless but that's just not a well thought of charger. I would recommend this product because Nokias are very good mobile except for this particular designed Charger."
1,The product does not work,"The product does not work, does not work, I feel cheated, just not working,should not mislead consumers that way, not honest."
1,THIS ITEM DID NOT WORK,"I received the product on time, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK. It worked the first time I inserted it into the phone, but after the first time, it stopped working. I tried it on 6 different electricity jacks, and on different phones, and it's not working! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
1,WARNING: DONOT PURCHASE THIS CHARGER,"Plain and simple, i bought this charger to charge my e71x, and it is not working. If you have a newer nokia model do not waste your time or money buying this item.Its not even nokia made like it says in the add, its made by Nakla-wtf!"
2,It's a faked Nokia,"I checked the product when I received it. It is not marked as NOKIA but NAKLA!! Is that why there is only a side view of the charger on the website? I am angry about it not because of the charger not working well(it works fine so far), but because of the dishonest behavior of the seller. It says Nokia AC-4U Travel Charger on the website, except the product itself is not."
1,Non OEM ( Knock off ) charger.,The item supplied to me was not an OEM Nokia charger as stated in the description. I received NaKLA ACP-12E charger instead. The units plug was loose in my phone. It was not marked with the Under Writers (UL) logo. I dared not plug it into the wall and instead took steps to return the item.
5,"Small, fast, cheap.","Not much you can say about an AC adapter :) It's compact, it charges quickly, and it's inexpensive. To those whining about the charger not working with their phone, surely they should have checked the manual/spec for their phone to ensure that it works with the AC-4U before buying. Electronics aren't lego - Just because it fits the hole doesn't mean it's OK :P"
4,review for management,Thank you for directly calling me for resolving the matter of my item not being shipped and sending another one.:)
4,Meeting Padre Pio,"Patricia Treece gives us a well-written and easy-to-read insight into the life of Blessed Padre Pio. Though it is a short book, it nevertheless leaves you with an appreciation of this significant figure of the last century. I lived in Italy some fourteen years and came to hear about him (through Italian relatives who visited him), though I never met him. I now have met him through this book! The author handles the controversial aspect of his life well; and I do remember that. It is a book well worth reading and passing along to others."
5,Art From China to Woodstock,"Hongnian paints and Lois interperts, thats the Yin and Yang of this wonderful book. His exquisite masterpieces are reporduced in exacting color. Her interpetations bring forward the mood and theroy behind his work that makes it underestandable from novice to connoisseur. I was especially moved by the explantion of using hues to bring forward the mood and intensity of the subject. This book will leave you inspired as it hs me."
1,the yin yang of painting,I was extremly disappoited with the book condition. At least 21(twinty one) pages were torn or not found . I asked for my money refund. I don't know if they sent it to me.but I think the book itself is very ineresting.
3,I would rather prefer Chinese paintings in this kind of book,"I don't own this book nor have I done any more than skim over it, so my opinion may not be useful. The book sounded interesting from the title, but when I opened it, all I saw were paintings by Western artists. Since it was about Chinese philosophy, I expected Chinese paintings. I'm sure this book is interesting, but this got to me, since I was looking for books on Asian art and design. But I suppose it's a good example of how Eastern philosophy can be applied to Western things."
5,adorable,"TOTALLY CUTE!! Just for special occasions or casually-- it doesn't matter, this handbag is darling!!"
3,correct the dang typos!,"I liked the story, but found the many typos irritating. Don't publishers hire copy editors any more? I'd give this author another try since the issue is more about the publisher than the author."
3,Well written but needed direction,"I'm not sure what I think about this book. The presentation in a multiple 1st person by all of the main characters was interesting and gave some depth to the story. My issue is that the book never seemed to go anywhere. The descriptions of the relationships between the characters were developed at length but when it came time for them to act is was glossed over to continue the character study.As a character study was the obvious intent of the book, it was quite well done, but readers looking for a more structured story line should go elsewhere."
5,I loved Charybdis,"Great novel especially for a new writer for under two dollars. Great characters and great plot, with some neat surprises. I will read the next one in the series for sure."
1,AWFUL! Completely disorganized.,"I was linked to these books from ""customers also bought"" link through reading books by Kindle author Karen McQuestion. Now, I have downloaded all of Karen's books which are the same price as Charybdis and they were AMAZING. I cannot say the same about this one. This has a plot that is all over the place and does not connect one event to another. It is completely disorganized and becomes annoying...I will not buy the rest of the trilogy. Maybe I am missing something from the other readers who rave about these books but I just ""didn't get it."""
2,Nice Poster BUT...,"What a pain to put up! Why would they split the poster in half and then fold to ship? It would have been worth my $20 if it came in as one piece and rolled in a tube.Our mural came in a terrible, terrible state, to the point where we almost ditched it. It took a lot of patience to undo the creases (zig zag creases from top to bottom not from folding). Lining up on the wall was impossible; bottom half of poster was too wide. We had it sliced to get it to fit correctly. It didn't stick for a week and finally we found it on the floor, stuck together. It took two people to pull apart and as last resort, we used wall paper glue. Hope this is it!All in all, the happiness it brought to our 18 month old son's face was worth all the hassle."
3,Looks Great!,"This is a great product and it looks wonderful on my son's wall. However, it took me a good hour to get it up there. It comes in two separate sections and getting them even and straight without having part of the sticker bubble up was extremely difficult. It does come back off easily and leaves no mess or marks on the wall. Overall, I would absolutely recommend it as long as you have the patience to deal with putting it up. :-)"
3,Cute but not the best...,"This is very cute and the Disney one I got for my daughter was great, but this one was not cut well along the edges and ripped trying to get it off of the paper because it was still attached to the border. Some of the outside border is still attached because I would have to cut it off, so it looks funny instead of being clean cut. Maybe it was a fluke thing, I don't know... I'm not very happy, but it seems to have brightened my sons day. He loves to go to sleep staring at it!"
5,"Almost ""instant meditation""",Sylvia Boorstein simply and clearly outlines the first steps into meditation. They worked for me. Clear three days off your calendar and try it.
3,Review of Don't Just Do Something,"This is a wonderful step by step manual for the novice. For someone experienced in meditation and/or relaxation exercises, there is nothing new here. While I did not find the book useful for myself, I have added it to my library as an instruction/reference manual to be lent out to friends and clients."
1,Storm Launcher,This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought. Would not fly. Broke 1 wing within first 10 minutes. Lost weight on the other wing. Had to buy special battery for even more money. Already in the trash. Wasted over $100. STAY AWAY!!!
1,are you kidding me,This looked like a great concept all the way up until using it. It ripped the plastic off the bottom on the first run down the drive way. Snapped in half after a five foot crash. Yes you can tape it back together however another piece breaks on the next run. It looked like a big blob of tape after 2 hours of use. Be prepared to swim after it if you want to fly around water. The best part about the Storm Launcher is that they gave me my money back with no questions asked. I only gave this a star because I couldnt give it a -10. Do Not Buy!
2,Not such a great deal,"My 7.5 year old hasn't had such a great time with this thing. It works as a boat since he can control it in 2 dimensions, but without a reverse, you get wet rescuing it (often).As a plane it is super fragile (it almost lasted 2 charged batteries worth of time (20 minutes). But even 10 foot drops sheared off the tail stabilizers (one side at a time) and 10 foot drops are pretty common. Tape puts the foam back together, but it is a pain to have to repair it every ""landing"".He likes the concept (and so do I, but the realization of the concept is weak and too expensive for 20 minutes of play time)"
1,Styrofoam and Tape,"This thing is almost completely made of styrofoam, much of which is held together by tape. I'm not kidding, this is what you get for over $100 (including battery & charger.) It is very lightweight, but also very fragile. So fragile in fact that there is hardly any room for error as you are learning to fly it.I was tempted to return it as soon as we got it out of the box, but my son (who is 10, manufacturer's reccommended age) was very excited about it. So we gave it a try. It flies, but one bad landing is all it took for the back wing to break off. Which wasn't too surprising considering that it had about the same structural integrity as a dixie cup."
2,Not for the inexperienced or inpatient,Need a lot of open space; time to charge between flights; definitely not a toy that can be shared with little kids-- most (all?)7 year olds will break it.
1,Storm Launcher,"The Storm Launcher flew up to about 4 feet once and then landed. And when it did, it never went up again. The toy is a little on the weak side meaning that the impact of just landing once made it difficult to operate after that. Apparently it affected the servos and rear stabilizer thus making it difficult to steer or control."
1,GARBAGE,This is garbage - son was hugely dissaointed - wouldn't take off and it broke in five minutes - expensive battery you have to buy sperately - DON'T WASTE YORU MONEY IT'S MADE LIKE JUNK.
4,4.5 stars,"This album is very different. ive listened to it many times and i still cant understand half of these guys. I dont usually like Tricky, but i do like this, it makes you think. Tricky did a great job producing this album."
2,Disillusion...,"disappointment and sadness overtakes one's soul while listening to this, at first glance seeming a promising record. Not going too deep in analysing the music styles combined, seems that Tricky has decided to start a revolution by pushing the world music one level up on the depressiveness scale."
2,could have made a short story,"The actual content or detection in this novel is all centered in the last few pages. The rest is mostly first person conversation by the policewoman Deb about her home problems: with her husband, son, laundry, etc. Quite boring. How I managed to slog my way through it is amazing as I really should have just given up early on. I do not enjoy this kind of so called detective story which consists of 95% unnecessary talk and only 5% detection. I got the feeling that t he auhor felt she needed to somehow produce a mystery so she had to just fill it up which she did all the way. Definitely not recommended."
2,Obscure For A Reason,"Famous mostly for the their obscurity, Appendix Out mix Indie amateurishness with traditional Scottish folk, a notion that sounds good in theory, but all it basically means is they sound like a bad folk outfit. The mournful monochromatic tone and vocals don't help. Miss it."
4,Pretty good crackers,"These crackers are very tasty. They're not as different from the Original 7-Grain ones as I expected, though. They have a very similar taste. But we do enjoy these crackers, and I'd buy them again."
1,A waste of money and time,"The problem with this book is that it fails on every genere it's trying to work. It's a lousy science fiction novel, a non-erotic erotic novel and an unromantic romance novel.Look, if the erotic writing was at least detailed enough to arouse then it could be lumped in with Spaceways and have done with it. But it fails. It's all description of skimpy outfits and cuts to the next scene.As for adventure Even Spaceways had more action, heck, even The Alien Trace (an eroto-sci-fi work in the 80s) beats this.I don't know why a sequel was published, but I hope somebody sat down with the author and said:""These are your choices: read a few penthouse letters and do better with the erotica, read science fiction and try to be original, or go actually have sex or an adventure so you can write about both or either with some authenticity""Do not buy this book."
1,"If it were at least fun, it wouldn't be so bad","Alas, it is no satire. If it were satire, Our Heroine would not be right Every Single Time (even when she's being stupid), and the author would be sniggering at her instead of with her. It's amazing how well she can bend other people to her will with only a single speech, or a single flash of her nipples.It's also amazing how often Our Heroine is both average and extraordinary. She's a mid-level bureaucrat AND the Emperor's ex-wife. Everyone who's anyone is beautiful AND she's gorgeous even by those standards.What we have here is not satire but Mary Sue. And a badly written one at that."
1,Beyond Bad,"One of the other reviewers gave this two stars and said he was being generous. He was very generous. If I could, I'd give it a negative 5 stars. Unfortunately, Amazon won't let me give it less than 1 star. The saddest part is that the plot itself is pretty good, but the writing is so bad, it completely negates anything else. If the constant comments concerning clothing (or lack thereof), sex, thoughts, of sex, and attempts to get sex or use sex as a weapon had been eliminated, the book would have been about 60 pages. Maybe not even that."
2,My Review of Dexta,I bought Dexta as a result of my curiosity about the author and the positive reviews of the book. I thought the story was interesting but the character development and plot very thin. I think if you enjoy other books by C.J. Ryan you would enjoy this book as well.
1,Worst Dvd I ever seen,I thought that the Dvd will include some episodes of the show.Instead there's only one ep.A previously included ep in another set Gadget saves Christmas.They only add a stupid Christmas carol with a logfire and Gadget singin.After that the typical Christmas songs in instrumental mode.Please don't buy this.Save your money.It's not expensive but even it's a waste of money.
3,A fascinating footnote in drug history,"And even if you don't embrace the drug subculture, you'll find much to interest you in this compilation. You know how all the right wing extremists keep complaining about how things aren't innocent anymore? How all artists sing about is sex and drugs? Well, they're wrong. Quite frankly, music was never innocent. Even mainstream artists are represented here. It's often quite jaw-dropping, and bizarrly pro-drug. The innocent old days? I don't beleive so. An interesting representation of what people thought of drugs in those old days. If you enjoy this, also check out Lucille Bogan. She was a blues artist who in the 20s and 30s sang about sex graphically, and used language and sex talk that'd make Easy E and 2 Live Crew blush. A fascinating, if unessential, album."
4,jolly good fun.,"I saw this show in London and have produced it with teens and adults here in the States. How I wish it were available to watch multiple times in US format. The songs (Andrew Lloyd Webber) and script make for a delightful rendition of PG Wodehouse on stage, as Bertie Wooster reminisces about romantical mix-ups among our favorite characters: Bingo Little, Madeline Bassett, the Reverend Harold ""Stinker"" Pinker, Augustus Fink-Nottle and, of course - Jeeves, who saves the day as usual.As with any adaptation of a beloved work of fiction, there will be the inevitable comparisons with one's own ideas of how the characters should be interpreted and I thought Jeeves was played without his genteel and genuine appreciation for Bertie in both the London stage production (1996) and this Canadian cast. But the gags, the production values, and the storyline are pure enjoyment."
4,Best Chicken cookbook,"There are quite a few recipes that I have enjoyed making. Some of the receipes are not to my taste, buy that doesn't mean someone else wouldn't find them terrific. I especially li8ke the ease of preparation"
5,Betty Crocker's Best Chicken Cookbook,"This book has a wonderful amount of chicken recipes that are family oriented, easy and most of them are fast to prepare. I highly recommend it."
5,Great Guide in Your Pocket,"Plilip Sweeny takes us on a journey through Cuba's rich musical heritage. In this compact edition, the reader is introduced to the major musical elements and artists that contributed to the development of Cuba's contemporary music culture. In addition, this booklet is a great guide to the recordings that capture Cuba's musical traditions of Rumba, Son, Bolero, Trova, and the music that emerged throughout the 20th century.This is guide is a must have for the enthusiast of Cuban music."
3,Under (Limited) Review,"I watched the entire documentary including the extra features. I want to say that I was initially discouraged by the following statement on the back of the boxset cover: ""This DVD is not authorized by all the Byrds or by Columbia records.""This statement probably represents why Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman are notably absent.I would have also liked to have seen some type of old video clips of interviews with Gene Clark, Gram Parsons, Clarence White, Michael Clarke, Skip Battin, Terry Melcher and Jim Dickson if they even exist.I enjoyed everything that York, Parsons and others shared about each album. I guess that I got bored at times not seeing a ""fresh"" speaker share a different viewpoint. Overall, I think that it is a must for all Byrd fans."
3,For diehard fans only,"Byrd completists will find this DVD a valuable addition to their collections, but casual fans will probably be underwhelmed. The absence of input by McGuinn, Crosby or Hillman, probably for financial reasons, keeps this documentary out of ""must-have"" status. But overall, it is well-produced and informative.The joke about Terry Melcher and the ""most obnoxious person"" he ever worked with, is by itself worth the price of this DVD set. I kid you not."
2,Byrds Fans--don't bother with this one!!!,"Right on the DVD cover is a statement saying not authorized by the Byrds McGuinn, Hillman or Crosby--that should be your first clue. The DVDs consist of performances by the Byrds which are cut off and short and a lot of talking by persons close to Byrd members stating their opinions of how the Byrds involved. I was extremely disappointed. How can you have a DVD set like this without MCGuinn-Hillman-Crosby input--the ones who know the exact story. Having two of the latter day Byrds on was OK but you need the original group to start the story. I learned alot more about the Byrds start from talking to Chris Hillman at one of his recent club appearances in San Francisco than from this DVD set. Don't bother with this --hoefully the original members left will come out and contribute to a better film about the Byrds--it is long overdue."
3,Mediocre telling of a fascinating Story,"Valentine promises to blow the lid on the involvement of the CIA and FBI in coddling and protecting organized crime mobsters in the drug biz. But unfortunately the book is mostly about the internal politics and personal pecadilloes of the FBN agents, with just a hint of the CIA complicity in the drug business. Of course, the book is about the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, but Valentine's style annoys more than it informs; he repeats himself more than a few times and offers a lot of admitted speculation about motives and unexplained events. Even the dissolution of the FBN, supposedly because the agents were meddling too much in the CIAS's clandestine mob ties, is weakly handled. All in all, I'd suggest passing on this one if you're looking for the dirt on America's biggest drug peddler, the Cocaine Importation Agency."
5,exceptional,"I basically bought this book because my Uncle is in it. His name was William A. Carrozo. It was misspelled in the book. However, he recently passed away on March 11, 2009."
5,Great deal ---and very warm!,"I wanted a pair of really warm boots, since the winter in Chicago is never ending. I also didn't want to shell out over $100 for a pair of UGGly boots :-)These are great boots. Cute, warm, comfortable and pretty reasonable. A nice small wedge heel, fully furry on the inside, to keep you toastly. Note that the leather grade is not very high and looks matte, but probably still a better option then most shearling lined boots which are some version of suade on the outside. Also they are not water proof (neither are UGGs btw), so I sprayed mine with a water proof spray.The product description is pretty limited, so I hope this helps."
4,"warm, inexpensive winter boot & cute","cute & cozy boot- it is lined throughout the whole boot (toes & all) the leather is not of the highest quality, but considering how inexpensive they are it is worth the price (bought a pair last season too & the heel wore out)...compartively speaking i own uggs too & they are equally warm, however these boots are less clunky...i get compliments on the boot all the time!"
3,good while they lasted,"I got a pair of these boots because they looked really cute were comfortable and had a full sheep skin lining inside (even the toes). And I really liked them, while they lasted.... The ties on the back broke and the heel completely cracked, I think a support broke because the heel collapsed on me. I couldn't wear them more than the one season I bought them in and I expect a shoe to last at least two if not more (I have boots that are five years old and are just as good as they were when I first got them). So these were good boots but quality? not so much."
3,"Great music, but stop yakking!","This is the only Glass CD I have that I don't listen to on a regular basis. This is the worst possible way to make a soundtrack album. The film is brilliant, the music is brilliant, but the album is like someone shortened the film down and laid down the entire audio track. I hate soundtracks like this and only give it as many stars as I do because of how much I like the music and film. Only the opening titlte is only music, and some tracks have no music at all. If this were reissued without the dialogue and sound FX, I would but it in a heartbeat and sell this one off. Morris's non-fiction films are too stylish to want to hear the dialogue without the visuals, and Glass's music is too good not to be able to hear it apart from the rest of the audio track. If the spoken word were done poetically like in _Einstein on the Beach_ or _Hydrogen Jukebox_, I would recommend it, but because it isn't, I can't."
3,dialogue,"Just so you know: This CD consists almost entirely of dialogue from the movie, with Philip Glass's music in the background. If you don't go for that sort of thing, then don't buy it. For true Glass fans, though, it's worth it."
3,Aterciopelados: The best Colombian Rock Band...,"I believe this video is good, but the quality of sound at about 1/4 of the videotape gets really poor... As far as the band goes, the performance is of high quality. The immages are nothing to be amazed by, but the fact that it' Aterciopelados...Well, you'll enjoy it. I don't regret buying it, but I'ld rather get the unplugged CD which is not available in the USA. I give this item 3 Stars because of the poor sound quality."
3,death on high mesa,asked if he had ever stood up face to face and killed a man:vengeance that would not be satisfied until those responsible for his parents death be paid in full
5,Best Mariah CD since Butterfly...,"This album is great. Mariah is really singing again. All the songs are catchy, with great hooks... you can listen to this CD without having to skip any songs unlike ""Charmbracelet"". You will not regret buying this record, and it's safe to say that Mariah is the best female singer out there!"
5,WHOA! Now were talkin,This is so good without a doubt this is the best Mariah Carey album I've ever heard. The best song: All of them.
5,Fabulous As Usual,"It's no surprise that this album is terrific because all of Mariah's albums are (maybe with the exception of ""Glitter""). ""The Emancipation of Mimi"" is more R&B/Hip-Hop than most of her albums, like ""Charmbracelet"" was. A lot of the songs almost have a 70's R&B type of vibe. Her voice sounds fabulous on this CD. She's not as breathy as she was on ""Charmbracelet"". My favorite songs on the album are ""It's Like That"", ""We Belong Together"" and ""Stay The Night"". This CD is excellent. There's not one song that's a dud. I highly recommend it."
4,way to go,mariah carey really did put alot of effort on most of the songs on this cd which made me impressed. since i always loved music that is fantastic. so if your new mariah carey or is a hardcore fan of her. go pick this album up you won't be dissappointed.
5,Go Away Haters,"Go away haters. This album rocks, and you know it, that's why you're giving it rotten reviews to bring the album down. However, as the old adage says, you can't bring a good man down. In this case, a good album.And the fact that you review Mariah's album means that she is significant enough in your lives to even make an effort to write biased and uninformed comments on the album. Here's my suggestion: Why don't you ACTUALLY buy the album and REALLY listen to it. Maybe you'll change your mind, but it doesn't matter because people (a lot of them) are still gonna buy the album because it's excellent.Hahahahahahaha!!!"
5,response to reviewer above me (Honey B. Fly),The edition with the limited poster is in the one with the digipack (cardboard) packaging and is neither the ultra edition with the 4 bonus tracks or the ultra platinum edition with 4 bonus songs and dvd
4,Let it Attach itself to your soul,"When I first heard the album I didn't like it much. But when I returned to work after buying I heard my self singing, ""I gotta shake it off... shake, shake shake it off"" Over and OVER! So I revisted the album and I fell in love. The song ""Circles"" really gave me chills from the vocals AND the amazing lyrics. I think we can all relate to that situation Mariah Talks about in it. Stay the Night and Joyride are also 2 more of my favorites along with We Belong Together which I liked after seeing it'd debut...So yea... She's definitely back and proving that there is a reason she is the #1 selling artist of all time"
5,The Best Mariah Album Ever!!,"The Emancipation of Mimi is Mariah Carey's best album by far. Her voice is right on track with all the up beat songs (It's Like that and To The Floor). Plus, she has her all impressive ballads as well (We Belong Together and Stay The Night). I highly recommend this album for anyone who has ever been a Mariah fan and for those who doubt her talent. This album will make everyone a fan and a believer of Mariah that this is her come back album."
4,emacipation of mimi,i got this album from my parents because i wanted it so bad. so when i got it i heard all the songs here. and i was pretty impressed with most of the songs since mariah carey's voice shines and her vocals is very good.
5,Great New Album!!!,"I was recently listening back to Daydream and Butterfly and found out she had a new album coming out. Anyway, its amazing! Best Mariah cd ever released in my opinion. She's back and hopefully her new cd gets the attention it deserves. I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates good music."
4,"The ""Voice"" is in Great Form","Once again a superb effort by Ms. Carey. Her voice continues to grow better and stronger with each album. This album is a must have for all of ""Mimi's"" fans. Cd boasts some great ballads such as ""We Belong Together"", ""Mine Again"" ""Circles""(my favorite song on cd)and ""Joy Ride"". Don't call it a comeback, She's been here for years."
5,perfection,"The emancipation is an awesome album. I have always been a fan of mariahs and she almost never disappoints me. This album was a shocker.. it was far better than i had imagined. She reverts back to her ""old"" style for some of the songs and keeps it moving for others. There is something on here for everyone. Take a listen and half the songs are great.. keep listening and they all will win your heart.I say this is more than worthy to have at least one copy of. Mariah has been critised for her ""whispery"" voice and for constantly working with rappers.. with this disc she left everyone is silence.. it really is truly great to have Mariah back at the top of the game.. but speak to any true fan and we'll tell you we knew she never left."
5,PLATINUM PLUS !!!!,"THIS RECORD IS AMAZING AND MARIAH GIVES YOU A FULL LESSON IN SINGING 101...MY PERSONAL FAVORITES ARE GET YOUR NUMBER, ONE AND ONLY, JOYRIDE, AND THE WORLD FAMOUS WE BELONG TOGETHER. BUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS GREAT, AND THIS ALBUM WILL MAKE A GREAT STOCKING STUFFER..YOU JUST WAIT."
1,Wet Cats Sound Better,"I tried to give my cat a bath one time. The screeching sound it made is what this cd sounds like. It's like that sound you get when you scratch a chalkboard! It's really that BAD! There is one song on this cd that is good and that is the single ""We Belong Together."" Other than that one, this cd is horrible! Even that one isn't good now because they played it too much on the radio and now I change the station as soon as I hear her howling. Also what's with all the lame guest rappers? I can remember when Mariah sang ""Vision of Love"" and her voice was so great. I used to be a big fan, but this sounds like she's been smoking and ruined her voice. Those rappers ruin any song for me. I hate this!I would suggest Madonna's cd ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" instead. That album is good all the way through. It also contains not one single guest rapper!"
3,"GOOD COMEBACK, NOT GREAT!","I JUST BOUGHT THE NEW MARIAH CD, AND WAS SLIGHTLY DISSAPOINTED. HER VOICE IS BRILLIANT AS ALWAYS, THOUGH SHE DOES DO ALOT OF SCREAMING. THE ONLY TWO SONGS I LIKED ON THE ALBUM WERE ""LIKE THAT"" AND ""WE BELONG TOGETHER"". THE OTHER SONGS WERE OKAY, BUT NOT QUITE AS CATCHY. VERY STREET/HIP HOP. I WASN'T BLOWN AWAY; I FELT THE SONGS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, AND SHE COULD HAVE DONE LESS SCREAMING. SO, I BURNED THE TWO SONGS I LIKED AND GAVE THE CD TO MY FRIEND. I SHOULD'VE JUST PURCHASED THOSE TWO SONGS ON NAPSTER INSTEAD OF WASTING MONEY ON BUYING THE CD. MARIAH DOES LOOK GREAT THOUGH."
1,Not To Buy. To Skip!,"With 2 good songs I truly can't honestly tell you to buy this cd.If your going by album sales, let me tell you something. Your in for a shock.You have heard we belong together on the radio, that's about the only good song on the album. Thats why they put out that song first and is using it to sell the rest of this awful release.I cannot truly ask you to waste your money. Download it for free off the internet. Don't waste your money. As a friend I'm telling you this. I just wish someone would of told me this, so take heed. :)If your looking for a good cd, go with Celine Dion's Live in Las Vegas, or Miracle, Celine also has a Miracle cd, dvd, and hard cover color photo album which you should pick up here on Amazon or any good record store. Reviews are outstanding. :)So I'll recommend those instead. I also saw Celine's show in Vegas. It's a fantasy, very elaborate awesomely amazing show. Purchase tickets at her websiteSo take care, see ya later :)"
1,I guess looks are all that matter Part 2,"Wow, this music sure is generic & pointless. Here's a little tip for all the ""music fans"" out there, don't buy a cd because you like the way a singer looks, just download their pictures off the internet & save some money."
1,"If she were as talented as she is fat, she'd be huge!","Just a reminder, Mariah Carey sucks! Why don't you save the $14.99 and buy some taste!"
5,Mariah is back!!!,"It's true...Mariah is coming back!And she is really in her top form!This album is a perfect mixture of great ballads (as ""Mine Again"", ""We belong together"", Fly like a bird"",...) and amazing r&b;/hip-hop beats (like ""It's like that"",""To the floor"",""Stay the night"",...).The first time you listen to ""The emancipation of Mimi"" you certainly rest enraptured by the return of the Voice. She uses her wonderful voice like ""the good old days"". She reaches incredible notes and she has such an amazing sound that you can only love her!Probably this is her best album.Mariah is finally back!Who can stop her?"
4,good looking out,i heard this cd at my friends house last night. it was pretty good since most of the songs are nice and has good lyrics. and if you have all of mariah's cd go get this one as well.
4,Worth Buying,"I bought four different travel books about Disney/Orlando. This is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite. Very interesting, easy to read and informative. It would also be a nice gift for someone traveling to Disney. Both my 12 and 14 year old like this book -it is probably their favorite. It has several pull out maps of each park and pockets for organizing trip information.The down side to this book is that it only addresses Disney. If you are interested in other attractions in Orlando - this book is not for you. It also does not go into great detail - it does cover the important things.In any event, I have decided to buy this book as a gift to any of my friends planning a vacation to Disney."
1,Childish and corny,"Disney World is huge, crowded, and can be very confusing. If you are looking for a book to help you PLAN so that you don't have to worry so much about all that stress, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!! It is basically just a fun little 300 page advertisement for Disney. They rate every attraction, restaurant, and resort as good to fantastic. When it comes to narrowing down what you can fit into a hectic vacation in Disney World (not to mention expensive) the last thing someone needs is a book full of all happiness and cuddles. Kids would love this book just because of all the cute pictures and little planning pages, but for mom and dad - stick with something more substantial (like the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World)."
5,PassPorter Walt Disney World 2006,Wonderful!! Full of valuable information. I love the organizer pockets in the back and the descriptions of the resorts. It even tells you the best rooms to stay in at your particular resort.
2,brake open only in emergency....,"This protein bar is below average @ best. It's advertised as ""creamy peanut butter"", but there's nothing creamy about it...more like chalky, dense, salty, with a hint of after taste seasoning. I wasn't expecting a peanut butter cup, nor was this my first protein bar, but with all the good reviews? sometimes i think its just minions from the inside. don't be fooled i have a very broad palette and know a good product when i taste it, this isn't it. Buy 1 bar, taste it, throw it away, then thank me for not buying the entire box."
3,Not the most flavorful or palatable,I was attracted to the product by the name. Who doesn't love chocolate covered strawberries? At first opening you get a wonderful whiff of strawberry. Then it wears off. The bars are just regular chocolate covered protein bars with a touch of strawberry flavoring. OK to eat but not the best bars. At least they were gluten free.
5,Best yet!,This is the best flavor I've had so far. You can really taste the fruit. I'll definitely buy more.
1,Yuck,"I've bought a lot of meal replacement/snack bars in an effort to lose weight. I guarantee if I only ate these bars, I would lose weight. I wouldn't be eating much. They're awful. I threw the box away"
2,Gross Gross Gross!!,These tasted aweful. you can defiantely tell that there is no sugar in these. Left a terrible aftertaste.
1,Disgusting,"I bought these because they were on sale so I thought I would try them - bad idea. They are not good at all, kind of taste like chocolate rubber. They all ended up in the trash. Not worth it at half the price, much less at the expensive rate they usually charge."
1,Yuck!,These bars are disgusting. After trying the company's ThinkOrganic bars I wanted to give some other products from them a try. These bars do not taste anything like a brownie. They taste like diet food. yuck yuck yuck. disgusting.
1,Terrible-tasting product!!!,"I have been eating ""breakfast bars"" for at least 10 years. I've enjoyed various protein bars, Zone bars, Balance Bars, Triple Threat Power Bars, etc etc. I just ate my first ""ThinkThin"" chocolate fudge bar, and it is BY FAR the worst-tasting bar I have ever eaten. What little bit of taste it offers is AWFUL. I hate to spend perfectly good money on something that makes me want to throw it away. Don't buy them. ICKY TASTE!"
2,"Healthy, but tasty....","Not so much. There is a definate deficiency between the real calorie loaded bar and one of these. The Chocolate is much better than the peanut butter one, but it still takes some getting use to. I found the Fudge ones doable after eating a few."
1,Tastes Like Cardboard,"I have tried different brands of protein bars since I don't eat meat, i bought 2 boxes the peanut butter and the toffee. They both taste the same and they taste like cardboard, and there is an after taste. Their are some good bars out there but these are not."
1,Not for weight management. Maybe for diabetics?,"At 230 calories per bar (with 8g of fat - 12% of DV) you may ""think Thin"" all you want, it's just not gonna happen. Perhaps this is something good for diabetics though, since it's sweetened with sugar alcohols and not real sugar.It definitely has a weird taste as well. I noticed it right away, and it lingers in your mouth. Sadly, the whole box is going to end up in the garbage. At least it was an Amazon Lightning Deal so I didn't pay much."
3,Not my favorite but I could eat it.,I like the think thin white choc. better.and another called the crunch. the peanut butter is a little dense.
2,Problems with food delivery,"We've been getting these bars from our local Costco, and really like them. When I saw that Amazon was selling them at a much better price, I jumped at the opportunity.However when we received the delivery, they had been left on our doorstep in the heat of the day, and something 'spoiled' or affected the external chocolate coating on each bar. Instead of being dark brown, they were a light tan color and had an off/stale taste.I'm not really sure if the problem was due to being left out on our front porch for several hours or if something happened in the warehouse or during the delivery -- in any case, we won't be mail-ordering these bars again."
2,THINK THIN MUDSLIDES,"ORDERED THESE TO TRY TO REPLACE SOME MEALS BECAUSE OF THE GOOD PROTEIN CONTENT. RECEIVED THEM AND THE CHOCOLATE COATING LOOKED OLD, ALTHOUGH THE PACKAGE WAS IN DATE FOR THE PRODUCT. MAY HAVE GOTTEN HOT IN SHIPMENT AND CAUSED IT THOUGH. THEY ARE JUST NOT VERY GOOD. REALLY CHOCOLATE, BUT TASTE BAD IMO. MUCH BETTER ALTERNATIVES I WOULD THINK. I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN BUT CAN'T."
3,Has 20mg of caffeine,"I was told by Think Thin this particular flavor of bar has 20mg of caffeine, which is not listed on the label, box, or on the Amazon page. Since I enjoy the taste of coffee, I liked these bars. However, I am used to decaf coffee, so one bar was enough to make me uncomfortably jittery. If you don't do caffeine, I would not recommend the Mudslide."
1,"Old, dry, disgusting when bought from Amazon!","I've never had a problem with Amazon, but I've ordered this product TWICE, and BOTH times the bars were almost white because the chocolate was so old, dry, and totally disgusting. When I buy these from Trader Joe's, they're great, but from Amazon - stay away! They've refunded me both times, but apparently still haven't fixed the problem, as more and more people are saying the same thing. What's going on Amazon?"
1,Yuck!,"These were so bad, i didn't even get half-way through the bar. I've been told perhaps it was because of a bad shipment from Amazon, but they were gritty, and had a terrible chemical aftertaste."
1,"Old, stale and a waste of my money","This flavor of thinkThin bars came very highly recommended, so I bought a pack of 10 on Amazon when they were a Gold Box deal. I was disappointed to find that every one of the 10 bars came out of its packet with that white dusting on it that very old chocolate develops after its sat on the shelf too long. Maybe they weren't old--just stored badly. The date stamped on the box was March, 2011. Anyway, they were not good. I'd really hate to think that's why they were a Gold Box deal. They might be yummy if they were fresh and/or stored properly before shipping. Since I'm too busy to go to the trouble of packing it up and standing in line at the post office, and didn't have the packing slip anyway, I just let it go, but I have to say I was really sorry not to have the joy that apparently my friend had when she had tried these."
4,Taste Great,I really like these bars. The only downside is that they contain Maltitol and half of the protein is Soy. I am not a big soy fan. Peanut butter is the best.
3,Don't Order These in Summer,"I just ordered these, and like a number of other reviewers have said, these bars may arrive fresh, or they may not. I also got a box that had that whitish coating on it. I assume it's being delivered in the heat and the coating melting and then cooling. As far as the taste goes, the bars are above average when it comes to protein bars. I eat a protein bar daily, and look for ones that are high protein, low carb, with moderate calories and fat. These bars fit that bill, and are quite tasty, but not looking fresh is off-putting. I'll try ordering these again when the weather cools, otherwise, I'll just look for a local sale."
3,Brownie,It was ok. Taste was good. Seemed a little old with the chocolate. Not bad frozen. Don't buy if you live in a hot environment.
2,Creamy peanut butter,"First, if you live somewhere hot don't order it. It will melt in the mailbox. The chocolate was melted and/ or old on the outside. The inside didn't taste good at all. It was kind of chalky tasting. I will not order it again."
1,not good,"The bars were melted when they arrived, the chocolate coating was gray and the bars taste like cardboard. Would never order these again."
1,HORRIBLE AFTERTASTE,TASTES KIND OF CHALKY AND LEAVES A VERY FUNNY AFTERTASTE AFTER THE BAR IS FINISHED
5,good price,"I like that it is gluten free. It has about 2x the calories that I need so I cut it in half and save some for later, which makes it 1/2 the cost. You just have to be disiplined to cut it."
2,Non consistant,"I bought two boxes. Inside one box the bars were a gray whitish color with a weird taste. For the second box, the bars had a chocolate color, like they are supposed to be and the taste was improved. Not sure though if I will order more."
1,dissapointment,i was shocked at how bad this was after tasting the White Chocolate flavor which was hands down the best bar i ever tasted
2,Great idea but hard as a brick,"I like the flavor, but these will break your teeth! I have taken to dipping them in hot coffee to soften them enough to chew, but I won't be ordering more."
1,I wish I could put zero stars,"I can't tell you whether or not these help you lose weight because out of the 3 flavors I tried (chocolate fudge, cookies and creme, brownie), I could barely get past the first bite of each of them. They're dry and taste disgustingly un natural.Oh and don't fall for the label of ""natural and sugar-free"". Dont trust labeling because its all about marketing and telling people what they want to hear, despite its truth, not being honest to your consumers. Do your research on ""sugar alcohols"" which the bars I bought each 12-16 grams of, specifically maltitol. Sugar alcohols cause bloating, gas, and abdominal pain, as well as ferment in your colon. They are also not calorie-free, and they still affect your insulin levels as sugar does.Despite all that, I will never buy these again, or even finish the ones I did buy, because of the taste. There are much, much better (and more natural) bars out there."
4,Good coffee flavor,"This bar isn't too sweet. It has a nice consistency and a good coffee flavor. It's not my favorite bar in the Think Thin line, but it's a great energy / protein bar."
2,"Might be healthy, but won't be buying again. . . .","I've tried a number of protein bars or low carb type, and would have to say that these were the least enjoyed. In fact, the taste did so little for me (not to mention aftertaste), that I pitched the last four. I hate wasting food, or anything for that matter, but the alternative was to let them go stale in the pantry. The texture was decent, but taste -- ugh -- waste of calories."
5,"good deal, great taste",i purchased these while on promo and figured it was a good enough price to give them a try..i was not disappointed. they are what they claim to be: thin but they pack a lot of taste. i'd purchase again.
5,"thinkThin Protein Bar, Brownie Crunch","After a thorough research on the infinite types of protein bars out there, I decided to give this brand a chance. Despite its excellent nutritional value, this flavor didn't rank well with Amazon consumers. With some reservations, I took a chance and ordered these. Let me say, I am glad I did! Perhaps I got lucky with my batch, but they were not rancid or dry like some reviewers complained. These were not only fresh, but moist and tasted like brownies with a bit of crunch. Hoping I'll be 'lucky' again, I will be placing my second order today."
5,Creamy Chocolate Strawberry YUM no blood sugar spike !,I love this bar with a cup of coffee. They have areally good strawberry and chocolate taste. Not manystrawberry bars out there. It hits the mark as anafternoon snack and NO BLOOD SUGAR SPIKE !! Plenty ofprotein for a bar. I give it 2 thumbs up.
1,The WORST!!,"Had high hopes, I'm on a low carb, high protein diet , But these are like eating cardboard, and gave me severe acid reflux, Wouldn't suggest them to anyone. My Dog doesn't even like them!!!!"
1,Think Thin Bat,The ingredients listed on the package were not as posted on the site so I received a credit for my purchase
2,Not So Good Bars,"I have tried these bars in the past but was very disappointed with this product, I ordered, went to eat the bars and they were covered with a white film and crumbled. Amazon was great and understood my problem and sent another order. This order was also covered with a white film and crumbled. I wasnt going to do a 3rd time. Kind of turned me off on ordering this kind again, not sure what the problem was - the date was 8/13 so i dont understand unless it was that batch."
3,Consistency Bad,Not a fan of this. Tastes like a protein bar. Not tasty at all! Will most likely not buy again because there are so many protein bars out there to choose from.
1,Sad.,"I understand that, in order to fulfil the 0g sugar/low carb/low calorie thing, they can't actually use real strawberries. 'Strawberry Essence' is just not enough.The first time I bought these I was expecting a texture closer to a jelly of some kind, so the crunchy soy stuff was a real disappointment, as was the artificiality of the flavor. You could at least pretend that there was a natural flavor involved if they'd tinted the filling pink. It's a pity and a shame that they taste so bad.If I were to re-engineer the bar, I'd add freeze-dried strawberry bits and maybe a skim coat of sugar free jam or jelly across the top before I dipped it in the chocolate. I will be dipping the rest of my bars in jambecause I'm too b=poor and too stubborn to throw them out."
4,Yummy Chocolate Protein Bars,"These thinkThin Protein Bars are really tasty! They taste like Brownies not cardboard, are crunchy and are filling. Good amount of Protein for an after-workout snack & the fact that they are Gluten Free is a plus. Will definitely order more!"
2,two stars from the newly diabetic preggo...,"i was recently diagnosed w/ gestational diabetes... thus began my quest for a yummy protein bar... this isn't it. i'm giving it 2 stars because my blood sugar levels were within the desired range after having it as a snack. i'm going to try the other flavors, but this one definitely is not one i'd like to have again."
2,taste like soap,"these taste like soap. that's all you need to know lol.go with creamy peanut butter, dark chocolate brownie or the white chocolate one. those are yum"
5,YOU'LL LOVE THINK THIN PRODUCTS !!,"I have made Think Thin Brownie Crunch Bars a part of my diet regimen for about 3 years. My doctor approves of the product - very impressed with 0g sugar, 20g protein and gluten free.I am impressed with them because they are very tasty, and they have been instrumental in a significant weight loss.Sometimes when I have a very busy morning, the Brownie Crunch bar is my breakfast. Other times, I use it as a nice pick-me-up (1/2 a bar (between meals.) I never feel deprived - it's just good stuff. I have never gained an ounce because of My Bars. How can you beat that!Also, if I have a problem with my shipment, the folks at Amazon are very responsive. That really means a lot!All this makes me a happy camper!I recommend Think Thin Brownie Crunch Bars. The other Think Thin goodies are have to be great. ""Runs in he Family!Thank you, AMAZON.Shirley Stanger"
3,"Great bars, but not from Amazon","I get these bars from a local store when I can, but I ordered a box recently from Amazon and found the same thing many reviewers have... the entire batch was ""bloomed,"" meaning the chocolate had turned white. The bars were perfectly edible, but they were tougher and not as flavorful as they ordinarily are when fresh.So, five star product... but I wouldn't recommend them from here unless their supply or storage improves."
1,awfull,"I ordered think thin bars from this seller, arrived today, but product is extremely old, went to trash, will never order from this seller."
1,OLD OLD OLD,"I usually buy these from Whole Foods, they are (in my opinion) tasty. However I got my shipment of these and they are so old the chocolate is starting to become powder again. Horrible! Don't buy from these guys go get them from someone who can give you new bars. I canceled all my orders for the thinkThin bars, I'll go get them at whole foods for more, but much much much fresher."
2,Not such good flavor,"I have tried a lot of bars and this one fell short on flavor and consistency. I LOVE the ThinkThin brand, but this particular flavor....not so much!"
2,Not Good,"I have not tried a lot of these types of bars to compare, but I did not like this one. It is very chewy and it might be filling too if you can finish it before you get tired of chewing it. I tried to eat these on several occasions and I noticed they also seem to give me a headache and just a general bad feeling."
4,Tasty & filling breakfast option,"I've tried a lot of different bars for breakfast. This is my favorite. It's tasty and truly fills me up for 3-4 hours. I love that it's high in protein. I wish it had a bit more fiber; however, as a vegetarian, I generally find it easier to get enough fiber than enough protein."
5,These arrived FRESH & good tasting for a protein bar!,I was worried that they might arrive dry and old... but these puppies were F-R-E-S-H!I'll just purchased another box from Amazon since the 1st was so good. THANKS A BUNCH!
5,Great protein bars,"These bars are great! Lots of protein, taste good and keep you full. Best I have found so far."
4,Very tasty but probably not that good for you,"I've tried a bunch of the ThinkThin bars, I like this one the best, along with Cookies n Creme. I was concerned this shipment would be old based on some of the complaints from previous reviews, but they must have gotten their act together because the bars tasted fine.It is however 230 calories a bar with 70 fat cal, so it's not something to indulge in frequently."
5,"Great taste, great value, very good protein/calories ratio","We bought this bar on amazon for a little bit over $1 each. The same product goes for $1.60 in our local Jewel. The flavor is great comparing to the PureProtein bars which goes for $1.99 in the same stores. Over the years I have had Powerbars PureProtein CliffBar, etc, this one tastes the best. Meanwhile, I'm always looking for something that provides a better protein/calories ratio. 20grams/240calories in this case is among the best."
2,Chocolate showed evidence of sitting in the heat for too long,"I love these little bars. The creamy peanut butter is delicious! However, ordering 10 of them from Amazon.com is not going to work for me. The bars had obviously sat in the heat, the chocolate had turned white and the peanut butter filling was dried out. Very disappointing, as they were much cheaper than buying them at Trader Joe's."
2,"Delicious bars, but not fresh from this seller","These are great meal replacement bars. I have them every morning for breakfast or as a hiking snack. They really sustain you without any sugar and 20g of protein. Brownie Crunch is my favorite! However, this is the second time I purchase them on Amazon thru this seller and I am very disappointed on the lack of freshness. Very stale. I will not be purchasing them anymore through Amazon. I suggest [...]. It takes longer to receive them, but they are fresh. Amazon has quick delivery, but you receive stale, not fresh bars. Not worth spending the money.Otherwise, I highly recommend the Think Thin bars."
3,Could not taste the peanut butter at all,"Was rather disappointing that there was absolutely no taste of peanut butter, but for a ""health"" bar boosting 20g of protein the taste and texture was fairly decent compared to the other bars, soft, chewy, not overly sweet nor did it leave any after taste, and best of all it was filling."
2,Not as good as other Think Thin Bars,"I eat Think Thin bars almost every day for breakfast. My favorite is chocolate fudge. Others might like Chocolate Mudslide, but it was not as good as any of the other Think Thin bars I've tried. It was quite dry and the coffee taste didn't appeal to me."
4,Better than I had expected,"These were my first attempt at a high-protein, vitamin-fortified, low-sugar bar, and I was pleasantly surprised. Chewy fudge, mild chocolate flavor, no aftertaste. I'll try other bars also, of course, but from what I've been told by friends, it probably doesn't get much better than these."
2,Skip These Bars,"I love the convenience of having nutritional bars around the house for quick meals. A good bar is filling, has a reasonable calorie count, is nutrient dense, and tasty. Unfortunately, ThinkThin didn't fulfill any of these requirements. These bars are very heavy, both in their texture, weight and taste. These bars 'chocolate' flavoring tastes artificial and unrealistic and leaves a waxy aftertaste. Although they do give a whopping dose of protein, they left me feeling hungry not long after eating. The generous portion size and high protein content alone just don't justify an repeat purchase."
2,"stale, old chocolate","These bars are great. They are very satisfying when I had bought them from Whole Foods. However, I ordered them from Amazon and the whole box had bars that were stale, with dry chocolate. I would not order these from amazon again. I hope they can fix this issue."
3,Not their best flavor,Has a slight artificial flavor. Would not commit to another full box but would purchase one bar at a time for varieties sake. Best part is the dark chocolate coating and nutritional values.
2,Lower sugar but tastes awful,"Really a bad tasting bar. True, it has a lot less sugar than a ProMax bar, but it really tastes awful. You have to wash this down with a lot of water just to finish it. I prefer Pure Protein chocolate bars to these, and I think most people would too. Truly an awful tasting bar."
2,It's not the same,"Think Thin has changed their packaging (no big deal) and unfortunately their bars (big deal). I don't believe the quality problem was due to shipping as I have ordered through Amazon before and been very pleased with the product. On this occasion, the bars were chalky and dry and maybe it's my imagination but I didn't feel they tasted like that last year (old packaging). I will not order Think Thin Creamy Peanut Butter again... but I may give Chunky Peanut Butter another shot."
1,yuk!,"I don't know if it was the bar itself or the shipping of the product because this was the first time I tried these, but these were terrible! I have tried a lot of protein bars and recently realized I have gluten sensitivities but I cannot stomach these bars!"
1,Bars were old and tasted funny.,"I purchased these bars via amazon subscribe and save. I have eaten one before and it was pretty dang tasty. I got these in and opened one, the chocolate had a light brown color like old chocolate looks and it tasted very bad. I threw the box away and will not purchase these again."
2,"not the best flavour. by the way, it's coffee!","i was kind of absentminded when i bought this box. ""chocolate mudslide!"" i was thinking it would be like some really tasty, dark chocolate flavour. oops! what was i thinking?! mudslide... as in kahlua mudslide! this is a coffee flavoured chocolate thinkthin bar. it's... eh, ok; but just ok. oftentimes, i _like_ coffee beans, but... eh, i gee... i didn't want extra caffeine in my diet from this. *sigh* i just found out that i can't send this back. i wish the product description was better."
1,"Chocolate Fudge lot that expires July 7, 2011 is bad - powder all over the outside of chocolate","I love these chocolate fudge bars. Unfortunately, all six boxes, from two different deliveries, had to be thrown away. There was powder all over the outside of the bars. The box was not wrapped in any covering, taped close. So, even though the expiration date is July 7, 2011, they all had gone bad (rancid).I have informed Amazon about this situation and hope that they will be able to correct it. They were very good in refunding my money, but that doesn't help when I need the product.I suggest that nobody buy these chocolate fudge bars. I don't know if there is a problem with any of the other flavors.I have requested that Amazon let me know when a new shipment arrives, but I don't know if that will actually happen.thinkThin Chocolate Fudge, 2.1-Ounce Bar (Pack of 10)"
1,thinkthin Brownie Crunch,"While these bars taste fine when purchased from a grocery store, the bars that arrived through Amazon were dry and tasteless, as though they had been sitting in a warehouse too long. We will not purchase them through Amazon again."
1,cannot eat,"These bars taste awful. My son and I both tried them, took one bite and threw the rest away."
1,Suck on a multivitamin instead!,"Yuck! I tried one of these, they taste awful. I feel like I let a multivitamin disolve in my mouth. That is how horrible these taste. Might actually work for weight loss though, as I feel nauseous and like hurling. Appetite suppresent for sure! Yuck. There has got to be a better way..."
1,Not for me...,Great amount of protein but on the down side it has lots of sugar alcohol and leaves a not so great after taste. I am use to consuming healthy bars but this one is just not for me.
2,Yuck.,I was excited about this flavor but so disappointed when I tried it. These are super-dense and really gross tasting. The brownie crunch and peanut butter (both chunky and creamy) varieties are a million times more edible.
2,Not as good as the chocolate fudge,"I really enjoy the thinkThin chocolate fudge bars, so I thought I would give the brownie crunch a try. I will just double up on my orders of the chocolate fudge from now on, because these brownie crunch bars are not good. Instead of brownie taste, they have the horrible taste that you would expect from a protein or diet bar. I also need a big glass of water just to get the bars down. So far I recommend the chocolate fudge bars and think you should skip the brownie crunch and white chocolate thinkThin bars."
1,Just tried to eat it but it was white and taste very bad. I recieved a bad box. Don't eat it if you see the entire bar is white!,Just tried to eat it but it was white and taste very bad. I recieved a bad box. Don't eat it if you see the entire bar is white!
2,Weird taste,"I've bought a few different flavors of these thinkThin bars and this one was my least favorite. The flavor sounds good, but it is not represented in the final product. The strawberry was tangy rather than sweet and the chocolate was chalky. I've had better luck with the white chocolate and brownie flavors."
2,strawberry Think Thin bars,I did not like the taste of this product. It has a strange after taste. I've tried other flavors of ThinkThin that I have really liked. The peanut butter and white chocolate are especially good. The strawberry flavoring in this bar tastes strange and just not very good.
2,Dry and Gross,"I've bought these bars at Whole Foods and they taste great (for protein bars). I ordered one package from Amazon and they were dry and the chocolate was all light in certain areas. Some of the bars were ok, but there were definitely dried out nasty ones too. No thanks Amazon, I'll stick to buying these at places that can store them properly."
3,Couldn't find in stores,"ThinkThin Chocolate Covered Strawberries is another flavor that I could not find in stores of the only health bar I have found that has 0g sugar, plus it is gluten free! Unfortunately, it was delivered in the summer and the heat melted the chocolate coating. Even after cooling off, the coating falls off and is a bit messy to eat."
1,old waxy chocolate & stale from amazon,Yes- others have said it. You can't buy these from Amazon. I've gotten two shipments of 3 in which the chocolate was old and waxy. Inedible. Yuck!Much better if fresh from the grocery store!
5,These are great!,"I really love Cliff Bars, they have a lot of calories though and can get old after a while... so I decided to try these, bought one from Trader Joe's and liked it so much I decided to get three different types in bulk from here. They are great- high in protein and no sugars...and they don't taste like it! They taste more like a desert. Definitely will be buying more... only thing is don't get them delivered in the heat!"
2,protein bars,I bought two boxes of these bars lemon and raspberry and did not like either of them. I read reviews before buying but they were mixed so I went ahead and got them. Very disappointing. Both flavours tasted of chemicals and I doubt if either bar had even been near the flavour they were meant to be.Thought they would be a good snack to throw in my bag but no.I will never buy these again Yuck !
1,"Not good for low carb, okay tasting",I've been on a low carb diet and bought these. I wouldn't recommend them. They aren't bad tasting especially if your craving chocolate/peanut butter. I get the gitters and feel awful after I eat one. I have tried Atkin's products which also have the sugar alcohol and 3 net carbs. I never get the gitters and it curbs my hunger. In my opinion the Atkins taste 100 times better then the think thin bars.The Think Thin bars have 10 extra carbs then an Atkins bar. They claim to be only 3 net carbs online but I think this is a lie.
1,Beware peanut allergy,"I love ThinkThin bars, but just a warning here. There's no clear marking on this flavor to indicate that it contains peanuts. The last ingredient in the fine print is peanut flour and it sent my son into a tailspin. I'm a very careful consumer on that front and ultimately, I should have known, but their other non-peanut butter flavors are just fine. So heads up."
1,DO NOT BUY! TASTE LIKE CR@P,This is the worst tasting chocolate bar ever. I think if actual poo has a taste this would be it. Nasty!!
1,One of the worst bars I have ever tried,Don't waste your money on this bar. It has to be the worst bar I've ever tried to eat. I had one bite. Too bad I can't send the box back. I even shared with a co-worker who had the same opinion and did not want more than the one bite she tried. I was hoping they would be good.
1,Nutrition info calories wrong?,"I was considering buying these bars, and I looked at the nutrition information. It said each bar contained 23 calories. This seemed awfully low to me, so I checked the calorie content of other Think Thin bars. They were ten times that much. I think somebody left the zero off, and they're actually 230 calories."
4,"Highly addictive, but sugar alcohol side effects","This is one of the best tasting protein bars in existence, I kid you not.The interior is fluffy, practically like the inside of one of those peanut butter easter eggs. The chocolate coating is just ok, and tends to melt in anything other than cool temperatures.The downer is that the main sweetener is malitol, which causes seriously stinky gas if you are sensitive to it. It IS a natural sweetener, but that doesn't mean it's all good...."
2,I normally love these but...WHAT did Amazon do to them???,"I often buy these singly from my grocery store, and I really love them as a meal replacement, so I was excited to see that I could order them for such a good price per bar on Amazon. After I opened the first one, however, I wasn't quite so happy. The chocolate coating was white and waxy looking, and the bar itself tasted dried out (definately not fresh-tasting). They are within the sell-by date, so something must have happened to them in storage. I had 2 day shipping and the days during that time were very cool -- not warm enough to melt anything. :( I would have ordered these on a regular basis if they had been like the ones in the grocery store. I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,"Sadly, Amazon is not the place to buy this bar","I went against the poor reviews when I ordered this product for two reasons: 1)These bars have always been good when I purchased them from local grocery stores and 2)I believed Amazon would have gotten any issues resolved since the time the poor reviews were written. While I don't know what the reason for the problem is, I can indeed report on my own observation. On all of the bars, the chocolate coating looks like it disolved away, leaving behind a grainy and off putting exterior. The taste of the peanut butter bar is nothing like the bars I've purchased elsewhere...these tasted medicinal, stale, and just plain bad. Other Think Thin Bars I've purchased from Amazon are perfect but this one missed the mark by a galaxy."
2,Usually these bars are great...,"Usually these bars are great... But this box was horrible. It seems that they might have melted and re hardened. The chocolate was a light brown color and flaky. The expiration date is still about 10 months out, but these were very dry. I would be hesitant to buy from this vendor again."
1,thinkThin Chocolate Covered Strawberries,Really really bad.All the other bars are so good we were looking forward to trying these.
3,Kind of average.,"It definitely tastes like chocolate covered strawberries, but the texture makes it a little funky feeling. The strawberry flavor tends to be just a little overpowering and artificial tasting. It leaves a bit of a bad taste in your mouth. I always feel like I had a giant candy bar after this one, the sweet flavor is overpowering and can be kind of nauseating to me. It is tolerable if you're desperate, but ThinkThin does have considerably better flavors. It's still better than just about every other diet bar out there."
1,Love these but all items in box are stale.,"I eat one of these a day and I love them. I decided to order off of Amazon because of free shipping. The entire box is totally stale!!!! I know what fresh ones taste like and these are discolored and gross. I can't eat them, what a waste of money. Boo."
5,Very tasty,"I'm diabetic and these are perfect when I can't eat a regular meal. They're sugar free and fit within my carb allowance. I love the way they taste. They make me feel like I'm eating something forbidden, and they don't adversely affect my stomach the way some sugar free chocolate can do. I no longer eat other brands because of this."
2,Taste is not good.,It has a pasty consistency and it’s has a bland favor to it. Not very good at all. I do not recommend it.
1,Taste is awful,"These are some of the worst tasting bars I have ever tried. They also are high in calories, which I should have guessed since they dont disclose the calories when describing the product.Be careful if you order these. I can't give away the extra's as everyone I know can't stand the taste."
1,YUCK!!!,"If I could give this product a zero, I definitely would! These bars taste so horrible that I could not even finish half of the first one I tried. I cannot believe I wasted my hard-earned money on this crud!"
4,An excellent concept,"This is a fantastic book. Its design and concept are extraordinary. I'm a little disappointed with the content, though. The first person accounts of each contributor's prom is a perfect place to begin, but I was hoping that Boyers would go somewhere with the information. The introduction seems to merely skim the surface of prom's history and a little bit of gay history, rather than go into the real implications of what purpose prom serves in American society (on the back cover, it's a ""rite of passage""--more on that, maybe?), and how that affects queers nationwide. I guess I was hoping that he'd make some claims. But obviously this is not the type of book he wanted to create. Maybe the next one....?"
5,Something similare to these Valo LitesNow instant track lights??,"These nifty lights have been discontinued!! I am looking for them, if anybody has these for sale... or, I would love to hear about something similar, that is easy to install on the wall... I use these in my store dressing room & they are perfect!! Any other ideas??? thanks sooo much!!Smiles,Larayne"
3,Convenient but not high quality,"The clear shades that come with the set reflect a harsh, geometric shaped red glow out the sides and top of the bulbs when the power is on. We bought the frosted glass covers afterward to try to soften the glow, but there is still a (now softened) red glow around the top of our room before the light aims white downward. Not as atmospheric as we had hoped. I kind of wish we had just bought floor lamps instead. I also wish this came with a few extra strips of tape incase you do ever want to move it to a different room or when we move out of our apartment..."
1,Nice Lites,"Very nice little track lights. Great for reading lights over the bed. Can think of lots of other uses. Easy to install, but takes much longer than 15 minutes. Must be careful while installing as they are not heavy duty. Lamps come out easily while trying to bend the ""flexible"" arm."
2,wipes don't work on mats,if you have a natural rubber mat good luck using these effectively. they don't work well b/c you can't really wipe rubber off easily. i would use a spray or something
2,Wayyy too expensive!,It's a nice concept but these wipes are incredibly expensive. I bought them to have enough to qualify for free shipping and didn't pay attention to how many wipes were in the container. They smell fine and work fine but I wouldn't buy them again.
4,Good,"Like every other thing that's around us the music industry has a history, and the music industry has a dark and hidden history filled with events that are better left unsaid. Not in this book, it presents the history of music from the first recorded piece up to the MP3 digital era of this century. Good structure and revealing information will not let you drop this book out of your hands, it's captivating content and insightful advice about the industry are things that you just cannot miss when searching for information about this area"
4,Need I Say More!,"Again Gary Cherone can do whatever he wants in the realm of music, his voice alone alows him to do this, big jazz ballad record and to the point. I highly recommend this EP, the ladies will love it! good music to listen to with a women if you know what I mean?!"
5,Need I say more?,All I did was download the title track from Amazon. I love it. I'm a huge Gary Cherone fan and his voice mesmerizes me. Need I say more?
5,CHERONE IS THE MOST UNDERRATED PERFORMER OF OUR TIME,Here is our modern day Roger Daltry - Freddie Murcury and the music scenes best kept secrets. Gary is very diverse and truly underrated. Gary Cherone's new EP is fantastic. I agree with the review about Gary's Ep to be on the lines of Sting. Gary is a much better Poet and Singer though. I recommend anything this guy puts his name on.
2,"ROUND, not OVAL!","I expected an oval dish, but what I got is round. The external package identifies it as oval, but upon opening the Corningware packaging says round. I've looked all over the web...I can find no such thing as this product in an oval shape.Not a huge deal, but if you want an oval dish, this isn't it!"
3,It's OK,If I would have seen its content in a book store I would have not bought it. It works OK as reference. Not worth returning it.
4,Nancy finds mystery in the present--and secrets in the past!,"Nancy Drew visits her Aunt Eloise in New York City along with her best friends Bess and George. Aunt Eloise's best friend, Delphinia Van Hoogstraten, is just about ready to open a glass bird museum--in her very own home!! The glass birds were supposedly made by Delphinia's late uncle, but from what Nancy gathers, Uncle Van Hoogstraten may have left behind more than glass birds! Trying to expose the reasons behind a threatening note, a broken chandelier, and a missing crystal dove, Nancy, Bess, and George investigate all they can about the Van Hoogstraten past, from family to friend--and dicover new dangers in the present!!"
1,Dissapointing,"Uwe Kocksich (Der Tunnel) gives a decent performance in this otherwise dismal film. Apparently film production values in the DDR circa 1980 were quite low if the Unknown Brother is an example. A grainy film print coupled with a laughable Musak ""classical"" soundtrack only added to a pointedly dull affair. I could only recommend this disc to a person seeking German language films of any quality. Fortunately this search is better satisfied by the hundreds of fine German movies available at Amazon or elsewhere."
5,wine country gal,"This is a great product! Delicious! Really added flavor to my spahetti sauce, and also enough for a bit to my chili! Very tasty!"
5,Usable classroom ideas which will change your teaching style,Ms. Heard has put together exercises and knowledge to create a stunning list of usable classroom exercises. She uplifts even the most discouraged teacher heart and gives you the renewed vigor to attack ignorance while inspiring others to find the light within.
5,Got it quick w/standard delivery,Book was exactly as described. It was shipped asap (I chose standard delivery) & I had it w/in a week.
1,Not as advertised - pencil marks all over the book,I bought this book specifically because the description stated that it did not have any pencil marks (or any other marks) in the book. When it arrived it was full of marks where someone had filled in their answers to the multiple choice questions.
3,Good Practice on hard questions - no instruction though,"This book offered a good focused practice on the hardest question types, but did not really give much instruction. It's mostly questions and explained answers, but no strategy or instruction."
1,Not Happy,"On the contrary to what was written in description of this book,it was not only new but also written all over pages with ink.Not happy at all with this purchase!!:-(("
3,Buy this book after you have already studied other books,"The LSAT 180 is a good way to polish up your skills after you already have a decent amount of study behind you. The questions are tough, and though I was able to wade through them, it was difficult to determine what an adequate time limit should be. The book breaks it down into per passage or per question time limits, but I found this confining and often finished either way ahead or way behind schedule on each question. Not knowing what an adequate time limit was, it is hard to determine how much this book will help me for the actual LSAT.Also, it should be noted that I found at least three mistakes in this book, so be forewarned that these mistakes ruined two questions and one entire Logic Game."
5,Great book!,"I love good thrillers, and this truly is one. The things young Tilli had to endure just to acheive something we take for granted every day. Freedom. She had such hope, such spirit. Nothing could stop her, and nothing could stop me from reading! It was a wonderful retelling of an amazing journey. One everyone could learn from."
4,Hard to beat for the price,"Hone works as it should. It has felt wipers/spacers, ok in 4 stroke cylinders. In 2 stroke cylinders with ports wiper tends to scrape on sharp edge of ports causing wiper to not last as long. For the price this hone is hard to beat, does A good job of finishing cylinder."
1,unsatisfied,I returned the vacuum twice as they were damaged during shipment.Then you cancelled my order.I was very unhappy as I still wanted the vacuum.I don't understand how you can ask for my review when you cancelled my order.I also had put the order on a new Amazon VISA card which I don't plan on using now.Nor do I plan on doing business with Amazon in the future.
3,Beware,"This book is from 1982. I have it on my bookshelf. If it hasn't been updated since then, you may be in for some disappointment. A HUGE majority of the places listed are gone, or the companies inside them have moved. With the internet, there are many better up-to-date sources of information. That being said, it is a cool book."
1,Poor representation!,I wouldn't even give it a 1 Star! Item sent Wasn't as pictured. poor representation that they tried to pass off
5,It's Great !,"If you are a lover of KWJ and SV or a lover of quartet music, then you will absolutely love this cd. The album great. I recommend it!"
2,Clutterology,"A friend and I watched this video together and were both very disappointed in it. First of all, the presenter is a poor speaker. Secondly, she spends over an hour sitting at her own desk showing us how she organized her desktop and files to suit her needs. It should have been advertised as a video limited to organizing your office. Clutter extends to many other areas, such as kitchens, closets, basements, etc. We would have like to see some of those areas addressed."

4,serves its purpose,"I use it to run. Sometimes gets a little loose when running long distance, otherwise its great. Seems a little pricey"
1,FM remote users beware,"Heaven help you if you want to use this with the FM remote -- a very common usage at heath clubs which provide TV rebroadcasts over FM. The FM remote connects to the iPod via a large plug on the left hand side. The armband provides a small circular hole on the right hand side, but no means of connecting the large FM remote plug."
2,Nike+iPod owners beware!,"This item was a gift for me. Though it is constructed well and supports the iPod Nano perfectly, it is not designed for any additional hardware. Being an avid runner, I have the Nike+ sports package. The Receiver is NOT compatable with this style arm band (neither is the FM receiver).iPod needs to design this arm band with additional holes (aside from cutting my own into the armband) for iPod accessory support."
2,"Armband -- ehh, not that great!","I'm not impressed with the quality of this armband especially for the amount I paid for it. It only comes in gray? Why? The material of the band is very cheap. It does it's job, but ehh, it's certainly not worth the money for the quality you get."
4,good but expensive,i like my armbad very much BUT i am afraid that the ipod comes out for the top so i would like a kind of velcro in the top so it is perfectly safe.its resistant and looks very nice.
4,SCREWING PEOPLE ON THE PRICE OF THIS CD,I AM SHOCKED AND DISGUSTED WITH THE FACT THAT YOU ARE SCREWING PEOPLE BY SELLING THEM COODER GRAW SEGUNDO FOR 89 DOLLARS THATS JUST WRONG SO THAT BEING SAID YOU NEED TO DROP THE PRICE CAUSE BELIEVE ME I CAN STILL GET THIS CD ANYTIME FOR WAY CHEAPER
4,NEW insights and evidence.,"The author brings out some interesting details about Mahavatar Babaji that may give readers new light about this legendary great soul.For a another revealing glimpse of Babaji's spiritual lineage, I suggest reading ""AUTOGIOGRAPHY of a YOGI"" by Paramahansa Yogananda,(SRF pub -via Amazon)."
1,Bad Move On My Part,"Very Very let down by this purchase.. was out of stock had to wait , when it finally arrived whoosh.....It is an unauthorized video of the bands career.. No more late shopping for me. No music all video. Didn't even open it.. Anyone out there want to purchase this???"
3,A real must have,"I don't like new Punisher MAX. I think that Mr. Castle was always great guest star but not so great main character. So, why do I recommend this?There are issues written and penciled by Frank Miller and inked by Klaus Jansen. They are best Daredevil and Punisher story and best drawn Daredevil and Punisher EVER. You can see black and white comic masterpiece in black and white, and it is worth especially if you are aspiring comic artist. Spiderman issues are also really good.GET IT."
4,Humanizing the Institution,"Too many hospitals-Cedars Sinai is an example-are vast, oppressive labyrinths, discouraging practitioners and patients alike. The LA firm of Michael Bobrow and Julia Thomas have infused their care facilities with cool design, warm colors, light, air, and glimpses of nature. They've carried that same spirit of humanity into offices, laboratories, and college buildings. This well-illustrated overview, introduced by Raul Barreneche, shows that architects really can enhance the quality of life. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)"
4,Great Case,"Great Case. Fits the Zen vision: W like a glove. Has a little stand attached that I haven't fully figured out how to use. I like it because it's stylish, practicle and will protect the player very well."
3,cute for a teacher's gift,"I purchased this for a friend who is a teacher. The face is small making it harder to tell the time. The watch was shipped running so I'm not sure how long the battery will last, should ship with the stem out to save the battery."
2,Not finding it good in the long run,"I have been using this product for over a month now. Initially it felt very good because it raises ones pelvis area above the hips making it more easy to sit on the ground. However, in the long run I am finding the seat cushion to be a bit too high and that is causing excessive pressure on ankles and knees, making it not so easy to sit for long meditation sessions. It would be great if the cushion height was adjustable - kind of like stacked cushion plates that could be added or removed depending on the user's preference for usage. Also the cushion is totally flat. I have found cushions with a slight incline to be much better suited for long sittings."
5,"great item, as described!",This was a gift for my sister (she is a Yoga instructor) and she loved it. The color is great and the quality seems pretty good.
4,very ok for the price,"The Zafu and Zabuton work well, but I'm just not so sure they were worth the price. I feel like a better price could be found for similar quality, but I don't know. It seems ironic to spend so much money that something that is supposed to harbor modesty. But as long as this is a rare indulgence, I suppose it's alright.I do like this somewhat tougher, taller zafu more than the softer, shorter ones I've sat on in various temples. I have relatively inflexible hips. I occasionally swipe a lint roller over it, but I'm anal sometimes."
5,Sitting stylez,"Received product in speedy fashion, as described, and am thoroughly enjoying it.Was to be part of my studios small seating arrangement where everything is low to the ground. Another great item was an adjustable pillow i located which is 3.5ft square and folds like a lawn chair (incrementally adjustable) which is also sharing space with these items and is a big hit with visitors."
1,Made my pups sick,"I followed the directions, giving them 1/2 dose to start. I sprinkled it over their food and within 10 minutes they both threw-up.Don't waste your money. My one pup NEVER throws up."
3,too big,"I really looked forward to a mickey mouse watch, when it came it seemed great but it works off and on, sporadically, took it in and replaced the battery after one month and the jeweler said the battery was fine, he checked the charge, but put in the new battery, it seems to be working now, but i find the face too big for my wrist."
5,great timeless product,This gum has a great full flavor that lasts longer than any other gum.Its my favorite gum of all time.
5,Just plain awesome,"Loved this gum. It was slightly, slightly stale when I got it, but still delicious. I still have some left (purchased it like a year ago or so) and its pretty stale now, but again, still flavorful. Love this gum, love this flavour, wish they made more of it more often, and that it was easier to get.If you like black licorice, get this gum for sure. Makes a good gift too (if the person likes licorice and/or is nostalgic)"
4,Sweet Nostalgia,"A while back somebody sent me an e-mail quiz which asked which of the following products, names, fads, etc you remember from when you were a teen in the 50s. That person said that they remembered everything but Black Jack chewing gum. I did remember it and wondering what happened to it I put a search on the internet and to my surprise found that it was still around and available for sale.So I ordered it from Candy Crate and it came very quickly which impressed me. I now have the pleasure of handing out packs of Black Jack gum to amaze all those of my age group. Love the expression on their faces."
1,A year past expiration....,"After chewing quite a few packs and giving away even more to friends,I noticed that the expiration date was July 31, 2010.... that is coming up on one year past expiration. (today is July 3, 2011)Despite the fact that the gum tastes fine, I can't leave a good review because of the lack of concern on the part of the Seller.Black Jack gum is good, Selling expired products is not."
1,expiration items,"very unsatisfied with these seller i have it and expired date items how can they sell it ,........easy for them we can't check the expiration date from shopping on line."
1,Artist Narcissism,"Typical self-aggrandizing narcissistic artist. Not well written! Philip should stick to painting or take some writing classes. What's with listing the book as ""by Ken Wilber""? Philip Rubinov Jacobson wrote this book. Come on, no one lists the foreword and preface authors on the cover unless they are trying to surf on someone else's fame. I have lost all respect for Ken Wilber and Philip Rubinov Jacobson."
2,Not what I expected,"I like Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares a great deal, and this CD was recommended to me as a result. But what appeals to me about LMdVB is the dense, rich harmony. And there was SOME of that here, but for the most part it just sounds like 3 or 4 people each singing a different song. I got my first clue that this may not be my cup of tea when I saw that the choir only consists of 12 men. That's just too thin for my tastes. Feel free to give it a shot, but just don't expect ""the male version of LMdVB"", like I did."
5,Unique folk songs performed by the best group!,"The Rustavi Choir remains the best Georgian male choir over the past decades. And if I'm not mistaken the song Orovela was performed by late Hamlet Gonashvili, the best folk singer that probably ever been born in Georgia. As for the suggestion above of placing Georgian songs in the Russian group, I'd disagree with that. Georgians are not Slavs. The fact that Russia was a colonial power in Georgia over 200 years does not mean that linguistically, ethnically or culturally these two nations are somewhere close to each other."
4,Enjoy the Georgian Music!,I am a bit surpised that a lot of people compare Georgian Folklore to Bulgarian and consider them as something very similar to each other. I want to admit that Georgian culture is way too different from Bulgarian. The thing that both(Georgian and Bulgarian) folklore adhere to musical principle of polyphony does not mean that they have the same musical roots. ... .
4,Great performance project.,"This is one of my favorite Georgian music projects. Although some purists may argue that the recording lends itself a bit too much to performance and not enough to compliance to Gerogian folk music traditions, I would disagree. The music is authentic Georgian folk music and it sounds good!PS How very sad that Amazon.com hasn't given this unique and important style of music its own catagory. Russian music??? C'mon guys!"
5,GREAT,"ITS PERFECT FOR MY NEEDS , JUST A SHORT DISTANCE FROM MY COMPUTER IS ALL I NEEDED & IT WORKS..."
1,Capitol Steps Can't do Democrat jokes.....,"Their other types of jokes like Republican/Conservative and Bin Laden are hilarious,but sadly the Capitol Steps fall down on the job with Democrat/Liberal jokes.Like the dreadfully boring Unzippin' My Doo-Dah,the jokes are done without inspiration.I laughed my head off at the jokes in the others albums,but when it came to the Liberal jokes,I did'nt even crack a smile.The Democrat jokes are so dull and boring that not even my Republican neighbors could laugh or find it the least bit funny-and they hate Democrats!Perhaps the Capitol Steps should give up Liberal/Democrat jokes-they do such a lousy job that not even a hyena would laugh."
5,Aerolatte - Hand-held frother,"We took a chance on this little battery-powered frother - at less than $20, how could you go wrong, right?As it turns out, it's the very best cooking accessory we've ever purchased at any price. From stiff foam caps for your afternoon cappuccino to full-blown meringue, this light-weight, solidly constructed, battery-powered whip is unbeatable.The unit ships in a plastic travel case and is of top-notch construction. The battery compartment is well-sealed against moisture intrusion and the stainless steel frother is a cinch to clean."
3,Wish it were better,"This is your average frother. I got it after my Bodem frother bit the dust after 7 years of faithful service. They don't make the model I had anymore so I got this on mega sale. I wish I had shopped around more. It is just ok. It doesn't whip as well as my other one and the thing that bugs me the most is that the on/off button is not a the end, it is near the wire neck. This means I can't use the tall narrow container I was using because I have to stick my finger down the side to turn it on instead of just pushing it on at the top with my thumb. It is worth the six dollas I paid, not the nearly twenty bucks it is currently listed for."
5,"OK, it really works!","I was skeptical about Aerolatte, so I went with the cheapest version. Once I got the hang of it, it really worked -- just as advertised. When this one wears out I may go for the deluxe model."
2,"Shoddy construction, batteries keep shaking the lid loose","Sorely disappointed because I had a good experience withe the all-metal frothers in the past. This one is just cheap plastic - the body that holds the batteries basically strains at the seams. As a result when you run it for 10 seconds, it vibrates to the point that the battery cover comes loose and it stops working. Tragic."
4,Aerolatte -- Small but Mighty,"Update: April 14, 2012: This Aerolatte is still going strong--just as great as it was almost 2 years ago!Original Review: My husband visited his sister who has an Aerolatte. When he came back from her house, he just HAD to have one! Well, I have to say, it's a great little gadget. He uses his every single day just to slightly froth up his morning hot cocoa. He's also frothed up his lattes and it works great. We've had it about 1 month with no issues. One piece of advice though, don't turn it on unless the tip is all the way down in your cup or you will have whatever drink you are frothing all over you. The Aerolatte is one of those kitchen gadgets you can probably live without, but once you have it, you won't want to!"
1,Totally useless,"I made the mistake of buying a 'used' one. It never worked, even with multiple tries with different sets of batteries. Yes, I had the batteries inserted correctly. Would only buy one with the 5-year warranty."
1,"great gift for everyone,,","I purchased 2 of these, one for a gift and one for myself. It was so well recieved as a gift and I love mine. Good for coffee, hot chocolate, salad dressings, anything that is light and needs a little whip. I then purchased 4 more to given as Mother Day gifts. Great kitchen tool."
1,"Loved it, but quit working pretty quickly","Really, really loved it. Frothed milk really well but then suddenly stopped working after a few weeks. Switched the batteries - nothing. Put off exchanging it for too long and missed the exchange window, unfortunately - toying with the idea of getting another one (bum frother, maybe?). If it were a few dollars, I might just get a few of them, but $15 is a lot to pay to make 8 or 9 lattes."
2,meh,"I got this frother 2 days ago. Prior to this I happily abused a bonjour frother until it quit. This one has poor battery connections so it starts and stops while trying to froth. Its cute, with its little cow print, but I definitely wish I would have decided to stick with what I know and get another bonjour frother."
4,satified,great little gadget for frothing milk for lattes. Not powerful but does the job at a great price
5,latte lover,I make my own latte every morning and love nothing better than hot frothy milk. I had an Aerolatte long ago and when it died I got cheap and bought one from Ikea for a lot less..........but there is no comparison the Aerolatte is fast and smooth....worth each and every penny!!
2,creates air bubbles not creamy froth,"I this with hot and warm milk alone then mixed it with chai tea. I also tried it with non dairy creamer in the tea. It didn't work for me. I got air bubbles that quickly disappeared after the first drink-no creamy froth as I had hoped for. Maybe I just don't know what I am doing, but I tried it multiple ways trying to get tips from multiple web sites to no avail. I gave up."
2,Broke after 9 months,"I use a frother daily. I tried the Aerolatte To Go hoping to get a more durable frother than the cheap Ikea Produkt frothers that I'd gone through a few of, each one dying after 5 of 6 months. The Aerolatte works great - sturdy product and substantially more powerful frothing - but mine died after 9 months. It broke in the exact same way as the Ikea ones do: one day it won't spin; at first you can give it a kick-start and it will spin, but eventually it won't go at all. I guess this is the motor wearing out. I tried a Cuissential SlickFroth too, but that was the worst by far (died after 7 weeks).So if you want the best possible battery-powered frother, an Aerolatte is probably it. But on a cost-per-froth basis, my experience says your money is better spent on the Ikea Produkt."
3,Annoyingly fragile,"Accidentally bent it a little while washing it, and now it makes milk fly everywhere if you're not careful. It works well, but I won't be buying another one because of this."
4,this thing really works!,"Its amazing how fast this thing will froth up a cup of milk. Its a little messy if you are not careful, it will swirl it right out of the cup. The only downside is that the froth isn't as good as from my wand. The best way I can describe it is the bubbles are much larger and have more air and space between them. Great deal for a portable frother."
5,"Worked for years, cheaper than Starbucks","I've owned this product for years - although I have the plain version, which is smaller) and love it. Admittedly, I go through times when I don't use it, so it's not been used every day for years. Lately, I've been using it everyday and I can say that my batteries last for a long time in it - I'm not sure I've ever changed them - and I feel like I get a nice froth.I'm not into gadgets - I don't like clutter - but this is totally worth it to me. I use a French press and this and am very happy with my home-made lattes and cappuccinos."
5,Money Well Spent,I purchased one of these many months ago and like it very well. So I thought to go ahead and get a backup unit. The case is attractive and closes securely. Buy one already! :-)
2,Weak.,"Not a very powerful frother. I find it easier to froth milk by microwaving it for a minute or so and then rolling a straight wisk between my hands. This frother is too slow and doesn't really seem to get the job done, even with brand new batteries. It does have nice packaging though. It comes in a plastic case so it stays safe in the kitchen drawer, which is really nice. It did arrive on time and in good condition, i'm just not pleased with the product performance."
3,Just okay,"Loved it at first, but it's not easy to clean and after awhile it froths jerkily, even with new batteries."
4,So perfect for the kitchen,"This tiny tool only froths milk, it does not heat it up. But it is small, works great, and I can finally have Chai tea without the $5 price tag each time!"
4,Milk frother,I use this to froth milk for my lattes. I have also used this to mix cocoa mix into milk for hot chocolate and it works well for that too. I like that it comes with a storage container.
1,Keeps dying,I bought this 3 separate times. Each time after about a year or two it just died. The first time it happened I contacted the company. The owner said just to send it back and he would fix it. But he's in England! It was cheaper to just buy a new one. I'm done with Aerolatte now though. I just bought a Bonjour.
2,Worked great until it didn't,"The frother worked great for 8 months, then needed a kick-start to get going. Two weeks later it totally died. I took it apart, thinking the contacts were dirty, but nothing fixed it. The motor is dead.If these things have a tendency to break within a year, you might as well buy the Ikea product. I'm going to give it a try."
2,False design and/or material,"There's no doubt that it's a great frother! It does what it's supposed to do; it froths any kind of milk darn good!Sharing my 3-week-experience, lactose free milk worked the best. The foam stayed longer than other milk. The fresher the milk is, the more foam you get as well.I would have loved it more if it did not have design and/or material problem.It's made out of cheap plastic. The body can't get a hold of its own lid to battery. I wasn't comfortable using it because it's just about to pop out of the handle while frothing.I tried to tighten the screws in, but it didn't do much.Finally Amazon sent me a replacement, however it came with the same problem.I am afraid I should return both of them and get a stainless steel version."
2,Poor Design flaws a great idea,"The unit is powerful and fast but the battery compartment is flawed by poor design. The lid which is located on the top is loose and ill fitting. I had to send the first one back because it would pop off in normal operation. The replacement still has fit issues, but seems to stay in place."
5,fabulous item,"I've had many foamers. I am, in fact, a foamer junkie. This is my favorite. It foams more easily and more items than the old bonjour I had with more of a blade at the bottom. I used to use the bonjour frother that includes a glass holder, but the glass broke and I had to replace it a number of times. I then tried the regular aerolatte, but without a cover, it stopped working properly over time because it didn't have enough protection. Now, this is my only foamer. I have two of them, one tucked away in my suitcase for travel, and one in my appliance drawer. When I want to froth milk for more than one person, I just put the milk in a tall glass and foam a larger amount, which I serve at the table with a long spoon. It is wonderful!"
2,Disappointed,"I owned the Aerolatte Mooo for about 6 weeks before it stopped working. Up until it quit, it created great foam and I loved how simple it was to use and clean. Fortunately, it was pretty inexpensive and I quickly replaced the Mooo with a Frabosk model that does not use batteries or have parts that will break down.I see that many Mooo users have not had any issues with theirs, so I must have gotten one of the ""slightly dinged and damaged"" models. :)"
5,Good deal,Just as described. Boy does this think pack some power! Wasn't ready for how well it worked.
2,If it worked it would be great,"It took three tries to get one that worked and after about 6 months that one died yesterday. The first one had some electrical problem and would randomly stop working. The second one had a bent shaft. The third one seemed ok, but finally the on-off switch does not turn it on anymore.I do not know if the stainless one or others would be more reliable. When it works it is a great little mixing and frothing tool in the kitchen, but I am tired of trying to get one that works..."
4,Simple and Reliable,"We have tried other types of frothers, and this is the most cost-effective one. We have several---one for camping, one for upstairs, one for downstairs, and one for travel. Others we have had broke easily, got out of true, burned through batteries, and so on, but this one just works."
2,"worked great for a while, but",it just stopped working. New batteries do not seem to help. I think it is a poor design error in terms of the battery contacts.
4,Frothie capuccinos,You need to start with about a third to a half cup of milk and use the frother mostly on the surface and move it around the cup. If you use more milk it will spill over. Once you get the hang of it you can get a lot of thick creamy froth piled high in your cup. I like the Aerolatte Moo. It makes each cup of capuccino extra special.
5,Love it!,I'm seriously wondering why I didn't discover this little marvel sooner. Makes even skim milk froth very quickly. I add a touch of sugar or caramel syrup to the milk before frothing and it's awesome! For those who think it's not as good as the coffee shop frothed milk I disagree. It really depends on what you use. If I use half and half the froth is much richer and thicker. The fact that it doesn't cost me $3 for a cappuccino makes it a much sweeter deal :)
2,"Okay foam, not as good as french press","After a few weeks of use I finally got this to make half-decent foam. Usually I use a french press, which produces an outstanding foam--super thick and lots of it, but they tend to wear out quickly if you use them that way. The aerolatte milk frother seems like it will last longer, but only time will tell. I'll probably go back to a french press eventually."
1,arrived bent,"The item arrived bent. I did get a refund, but Amazon and the supplier refused to replace it, so the outcome was that I have to order it all over again. I have another model that works fairly well, but the foam seems to dissolve fairly quickly when it is spooned onto the coffee."
1,Disappointed it didn't work,"I used an Aerolatte at my daughter's house, liked it and chose to order one for myself. It arrived but wouldn't work. I put new batteries in it, in case the ones in it were dead, but still nothing. There is no contact information for the company, so my only recourse was to return it to Amazon. I may have gotten the only one that didn't work, however that was a turn off and I didn't ask for a replacement."
