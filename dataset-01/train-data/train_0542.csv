5,Excellent listening emotionally driven music,"I was looking everywhere for the ""ever after"" trailer 'tell me a fable'. In buying the ever after sound track I was highly disappointed in finding only the orchestrated back ground music. I was so glad I was pointed in the right direction. I was thinking that ""fable"" was going to be the only good track on the CD, but I was wrong. The entire CD beautifully mixed with the music and the emotional driven sounds of Robert Miles is a MUST HEAR. You can just close your eyes and let his music do the story-telling for you. It has a great mix of techno beats with the soft edge of symphony. Its one of my favorites now."
3,OK at best,"I got this CD a couple of years ago when I first heard Fable on a radio station. I was hoping for more of the same when I purchased Dreamland, but unfortunately, that was not the case. The only songs that are good on this CD are the overplayed Children and Fable. There's probably another good song on this CD, but I can't seem to remember the name of it. If you're a trance fan, you know there are CDs out there that are better than Dreamland. I can't really say that this type of music can be classified as trance, but there are some similarities to that genre. However, I have to give some credit to Robert Miles. He does have some fantastic piano skills. :) Overall, I give this album 3 stars, one for each of the songs listed above, and one for the song that I can't remember at this moment."
3,adventurous but repetitive,robert miles is a great music maker but this album does not reflect this talent.Too many of his beats are the same all similar to children.For me red zone is the best song on the album.if your lookin for something more diverse check his following album '23am'which is of a far higher quality
5,FARORITE SONG,"The song Fable (message version) is the coolest song I've ever heard. I got the idea to buy it from hearing it in the preview for the movie EVER AFTER. I looked up some words I heard in the song and found this. I took the risk of buying it without being sure this was the song, but it was! I get goosebumps listening to it. It's worth buying this CD just for this song!"
5,Never heard of this guy but this CD is fantastic,"I had never heard of Robert Miles before hearing ""Children"" on the radio. I'm a big rock and techno fan and thought this CD was fantastic. I can listen to this CD over and over and I don't get tired of it. Not all the songs are great, but I would say 3/4 are. I highly recommend this CD to techno and mood music lovers."
5,The best dance/techno cd ever!!!,"I listen to this one all the time. It's a great journey for the heart and soul. If you like great dance music, then this one is for you. I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. :-)"
5,A Brilliant Mix,"I am not a fan of Techno/Dance type music, but Robert Miles created a great album. People I know who don't like Techno love Robert's music. ""Children"" is such a soothing song while ""One and One"" creates a lively atmosphere."
5,This music just puts me at ease.,I really like the acoustic guitar used in some of the songs on this cd. This cd is so relaxing and comforting. It's beautiful!!
1,ladies and gentlemen,"The emergency exits are to your left and right, and the sick bags are located under your seats. You will not feel any turbulance as this is not a difficult flight. The inflight entertainment shall be akin to a nauseating hollywood summer dog movie, replete with precocious orphan children informing you smugly when to be happy and when to be sad. Step into your comfort zone and be taken where you are bound; you are there already. Mr Miles is a fine businessman."
4,track list,track list from the single shineShin(7 versions) remixmajor wad mixmad mixragga dubtodd terry club mixremix dubalbum version
4,several classic tales from The Twilight Zone,"I wish there were more stories in this collection, but it's still a bumper crop: ""The Lonely""; ""Mr. Dingle, The Strong"", ""A Thing About Machines"", ""The Big Tall Wish"", ""A Stop at Willoughby"", ""The Odyssey of Flight 33"", and ""Dust"" are the selections in this paperback."
4,The first caucasian sensation,"I bought this album back in 1995, and it is a testmonial to the era in which it was made, The Golden Age of Hip-Hop. The lyrics are tight, beats are tight and the productions tight. Miilkbone truly dispalys some skills.Before there was Eminem...there was a kid from Jersey name MIILKBONE. Truly the original ""caucasian sensation"". Definitely worth having in your collection."
3,My boys enjoyed it.,My husband was a bit disappointed by the DVD's. He remembered them being better when he was younger. My boys enjoyed watching them nonetheless.
5,NFL Follies review,"This item was exactly what I expected it to be, the same NFL Films I watched as a youth, yet now on DVD."
5,Fan-Tastic Football Follies,"I bought this product for my husband for Christmas and he Absolutely Loved it. I heard him in the living room cracking up as he watched it. He was very satisfied with the product and we would highly recommend it to anyone who is a football fan, or anyone who just enjoys a good laugh."
4,A great crowd-pleaser!,"I teach an Earth Science class, and run segments from the NFL follies before class begins, and during breaks. It really helps to set a fun, informal tone for the class, and is a real crowd-pleaser.Vry entertaining."
3,Lacking in detail,"This disc in the series covers the Panther but the video actually provides very little detail about the Panther itself, providing only a cursory overview of the history of why the Panther was developed in a hurry and a very sketchy outline of the course of the war with video of primarily of Panthers as they make vague references to the part played by the Panther. There is very little detail on the actual development history, design and performance and nothing of significance on actual engagements.Overall a disappointment, especially compared to some of the others in the series,particularly the discs on the armored cars and the artillery."
5,"Thank you, Amazon",really couldn't believe how difficult this was to find locally in the correct color. This is plain white so matches my phone color. Works so well for typing with both hands while talking.
5,"Excellent, Concise Text","This is an excellent, clearly written, text on Survival Analysis. I am a clinician and clinical researcher and find this to be an excellent tool."
4,"The cover is ok, with some small crease.","The book is good, only I cannot understand survival analysis totally...Or it is because the teacher made it so theoretial that I cannot understand."
5,IN THE AMERICAN GRAIN,"William Carlos Williams has written a classic text, poetic and profound, of vignettes about American icons who shaped our society throughouthistory. This is a fever dream of impressionistic prose, cutting into the heart of each historical character, what they did, what it meant and stillmeans. History as shimmering as a chiaroscuro."
5,wonderful book,"A great fictional retelling of the agonies of Biafra in the late 60's.Great cast of characters, excellent prose"
3,Half Of A Yellow Sun,"I was looking forward to reading this, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I struggled with reading this story and at the end, while I did like it, it's not one that I would read again. I'd still recommend it because it is very well-written, complete, and is a better quality of literature."
3,beautiful but problematic,"This is a beautiful book whose characters are compelling but the pace of the plot was so slow, that I became dragged down and had a difficult time finishing it. Nevertheless, I learned a lot about Nigeria and Biafra-and am glad I read it-but wished I hadn't bought the hardcover."
4,Half of a Yellow Sun Comments,"Ms. Adichie has a tremendously powerful command and control of language. She is able to draw the reader into the novel and keep one's attention throughout. She is expressive. Her imagery connects the reader in such a way that breaks in reading regardless of length allows for re-entering the novel with considerable ease. From the opening line to the end, I always felt I was present in the action."
5,A New Classic,"Absolutely brilliant and heart-breaking. I have sent this copy to a friend in Nigeria, who has not been able to get her hands on a copy of this book. All Nigerians, and all people interested in the history and fate of Nigeria, should read this book."
3,friend recommended,I'm at the middle now. I am not intrigued anymore. The beginning was very good but I find now it's dragging on.
3,Not so sunny yet,"I am about a third of the way through this book. It's not that its a terrible read, but I am not hooking in to the purpose of the book. It's probably just me. I'm sure it will get going in the next few pages!!??"
3,Half of a Yellow Sun,"Interesting and captivating read on author viewpoint of the African states. Constantly wanting to find out how it ends, though left wanting."
2,Cumbersome & Tedious,"This book is only nominally ok. The story drags and takes forever to get through. I had heard good things about this author, but I was disappointed with the writing."
4,Half of a Yellow Sun,"If you are looking for a good novel about Africa, Half of a yellow sun is definitely for you. This is one of the best African novels written by the Nigerian Author Chamamanda Adichie. The title of the book comes from the Biafran flag. The book portrays the tumultuous lives of five characters and how their lives intertwined during the Nigeria-Biafra war of the 1960's. All the political events are factually true. The characters consist of Ugwu, a loyal house boy for a professor, a university professor, Olanna, the professor's mistress, Richard, a white British expat & Kaniene, Olanna's twin sister. I really enjoyed the characters in the story. They were easy to identify with and very real. This book is definitely a page turner. It's more than a war novel. It's about love, loyalty, betrayal, interracial r/ship, loyalty & moral obligation. Must READ"
5,Half of a Yellow Sun,"Although it took an inordinately long time for Amazon to locate this book,when finally found and delivered, the book was in the condition described."
2,"Ambitious novel, lacks focus","I agree with Music Mom. It really drags - so much so, that I didn't notice the time switches as I plodded through it - and became utterly confused about the course of events. The time switches emphasise that the three ""main"" characters hardly change throughout the decade. Their circumstances alter but nothing really changes them psychologically. The time switches also emphasise that the novel really doesn't move forward at all. ""Sweeping"", ""all encompassing"", ""ambitious"" are adjectives I see employed to discuss the book. I agree, but add that it lacks a focus and a narrative thread to keep this reader interested. An interesting and worthy topic, but a novel in need of a good editor."
2,Learning about Biafra,"The book is interesting and informative as a docu-fiction about the biafra-Nigerian war, from the Biafran point of view, a view the West knows little about. However the writing style lacks relief as it goes through the various events."
4,Unforgivable Things,"""There are some things that are so unforgivable that they make other things easily forgivable,"" spoken by Kainene, Olanna's fierce twin sister, sums up Half of a Yellow Sun. Adichie's story of the Biafran war, as seen through the eyes of several different characters, spells out the unforgivable in painful, matter-of-fact detail. Other things, vanity, betrayal and an elitism chief among them, become forgivable as a family finds that, stripped bare, they are each others treasures.Aww Sookie Sookie: Omar's Revenge"
5,Great Book!,"Sad that it deals with the evils of war, but a great book that shows the ugliness of war in general.As a Nigerian, it serves as a teaching tool about the Biafran War."
1,NOT a children's book!,"Omy goodness! As stated in the title, this book is not meant for kids. The moment I saw the first cuss word, I threw the book away. If you want the book without foul language, order a kids version! TY for reading !:)"
2,Love the book disappointed in its condition,Great book. Had read a paperback version and wanted to give hardbacks as gifts. I ordered two books. Arrived just before Christmas. Both books were damaged. Jacket covers were torn and pages were bent. Looked like they were used. Unsuitable for gift giving.
3,White Fang,This book was a very good book. I would suggest to those of you who like books about Nature. The book is about a young wolf who is beaten several different times and it is because of his heritage that he survives. I don't want to ruin the ending for you but the book is a complete 180 degree turn from the movie. The ending is totally different than the movie. White Fang has many learning experiences that help him get to where he was. Once again I just want to say that it is a great book and i want to suggest to people who enjoy books about nature.
2,The Gory Truth of Call of the Wild,"I highly recrecommend Call of the Wild to Sick minded people who do nothing but sit around all day playing bloody gore war games rated M. There is a bloody graphic death every chapter! YAY! OH! And who could forget the gory fight scences? Eptic blood battles with the moral being winners kill and loosers show mercy! What an important life lesson! And the PAIN!! How can life go on without PAIN? Broken bones, body slashes, club beatings, and, best of all, freezing to death!!! Ah, What a life! In conclusion, I prefer MY games rated E for everyone."
4,Call Of The Wild Review,This is a compelling tale of a dog named Buck taken from his home and used to find gold. Sometimes there could be a funny moment but most of the time you can see the cruel abuse people give to dogs and other animals. Buck is a true survivor and he makes it through that perilous journey. You should read this book and you will be at the edge of your seat all through it. A lot of deaths happen in this story so if you really do not like animal abuse I wouldn't recommend it to you. I can't tell you the whole story because I don't want to give you away one detail that might spoil the end or any other good things that happen. Read it and you'll find out how a dog named Buck survived!
3,Leader's Guide may be of limited use,I just wanted to caution folks who want to get the leader's guide...it relies extensively on the video and participant's guide. Each lesson assumes you will watch the video and go through the discussion questions in the participant's guide. I found it to be of limited use and think the participant's guide is actually more helpful for leading/facilitating discussions.
4,Good stuff! Used on my convertible top. Me like :-),"Hard to find a good convertible top waterproofer... this stuff works well. Not sure for how long yet, but doing a good job after application."
4,Expensive But Works Like A PRO,With shipping and the cost it comes in at about $100.00 but it does work like commercial grade guard. I've used it on all outside furniture and shoes and nothing I've tried even compares to how well this works. I recommend this it is worth the money if you can spare it.
5,Excellent product and service,"I have just finished using this product to protect my canvas boat cover. Seems good, but will have to see how it performs after some rain. I'm sure it will be fine."
4,Fabric Guard 303,"This is the first time using this product. We used it precisely as described in the directions. So far, so good. We've had plenty of sunny hot days and some heavy down pore rains with hail in the south this year with no fading of the fabric and it is definitely water proof. Time will tell if this is an excellent product in protecting our canopy and chair cushions over the long run. We ended up using our first gallon in 2 days and this stuff is quite pricey to ship, so we are still deciding whether to purchase another gallon."
5,303 High tech Fabric Guard,"303 High Tech Fabric Guard was easy to apply, what a great water proofing product. I will use it every year to keep my Sunbrella looking new and protected from the harsh Florida sun."
5,303 High Tech Fabric Guard,Excellent product....My husband says this is one of the best products on the market. We will continue to use this as long as we have our boat. Helps protect year after year.
1,High Tech 303 Fabric Guard,"Ordered high tech 303 fabric guard and cleaner, recieved and followed instructions on how to clean first,(sunbrella boat cover)went through that process, then let dry for 8 hours, followed instructions for application, I used a 1.5 gallon chemical sprayer.Put on the whole gallon for a 19' boat.The product had plenty of time to dry. Inspected after rain and found inside of boat still gets very wet.This product is terriable for the price.Don't waste your money!!!!"
2,Doesn't work at all,Works as a water repellent but does not stop fading at all. I applied this to several different outdoor cushions all of varying fabrics. Every single one faded within two weeks. Save your money and just buy scotchgard.
2,Not great style for Handel,"Ms. Zucker is a wonderful flutist. I listened to the excerpts on line out of curiosity and they don't have much to do with Baroque style. The ""slow"" movements are much too slow and sound subdivided, and the articulations are wholly un-Baroque. Better off to listen to a traverso player play these pieces or at least someone more conversant with Baroque performance practice. I love her modern repertoire recordings."
1,POOR QUALITY CONVERSION TO DVD,"Please save your money. This DVD is one of the worst tape to DVD transfers I have ever seen. The contrast is bad and there is a yellowish green color cast through the entire movie.If you buy this to see Laura Gemser, you will be disappointed. She is not in the movie as much as you might think.Please avoid this poor quality DVD. I would have given it ZERO STARS if Amazon's rating system allowed that."
1,Amateurish trash,"This movie was a complete waste of my time. It must have been shot as a high school project of some type. My advice, if you encounter this movie for rent, move on quickly and save yourself the price of a donut and coffee."
1,worthless,If you want to know what is bad movie buy this one. I would not classify it as erotic (just couple shots and no s.e.x. at all). It shows just some army actions. The name of the movie had confused me.
4,Surprisingly fresh and beautiful,"I just picked this up at my local CD store used for $2.50 - figured what the hell, I have always meant to try Jamal, just never did.Well, let me tell ya, I am totally into this CD!!!Thing is, it might have something to do with my ""freshness"" - meaning I have never really listened to him before. There is definitely something to say with being familiar with a musician's style and sound... unless you don't know what that is!This is challenging music.You HAVE TO listen to it with a wide-open mind and with few if any preconceptions and expectations.If you can dig this for what it is and not compare it to other music of his or of other folks - well you just 'might' be able to really enjoy the music!Oh, and play it a whole bunch, it gets more stupendous with every listen!!!I emphatically disagree with the other two interviews. I love it. It is challenging as hell, but so worth it once it grows on you.Highly recommended."
3,"Buy ""Biomolecular Crystallography""","Buy ""Biomolecular Crystallography"" instead. This book tries to condense too much information on too few pages. I didn't understand everything in ""Biomolecular Crystallography"", but the sections that I did understand, are very well written. It's more expensive, but it's a better book, for those that really want to understand crystallography beyond various tutorials on the internet and ""Crystallography Made Crystal Clear""."
2,Package slightly misleading,"This package is labeled only ""Volume 2."" What it doesn't specify is that it is the new release of season 1, volume 2. However, the episodes it contains are out of order. It has 20 episodes out of the 65 that were broadcast - mostly the ones from the middle of the season. So if you already have the entirety of season 1, don't buy this DVD. THe 2 stars are for the lack of labeling on the package. I am sending mine back since I already own all of season 1. I don't own season 2 and am not the type to worry about the whole BCI to Mill Creek thing that has been mentioned in other reviews of He Man and She Ra DVD's. I watch the shows and don't really care about extras. If you do care about extras, then you should read the other reviews."
5,Great Nostalgia,"I used to love this show as a kid growing up,i remember having all the action figures except Evil Lynn and Man at Arms, brings back alot of great memories,i seen this at Target for 5 dollars and had to get it,the color and picture are fantastic,i can't see any specs of dirt that are really noticable,very well done for an early to mid 80s cartoon,the animation is really good,better than i remember,its nice to see cartoons that arent digitally done like they are these days,the characters we're drawn so good, one of the great cartoons of all time."
5,Converted to Baseball,"I was never a fan of baseball until I read David James Duncan's The Brothers K. However, this is a story that is not just about a sport, but an extraordinary family of four brothers, twin sisters, a 7th Day Adventist mother, and a father who had to forego his dream of pitching to provide for his family. What sets this novel apart aside from the wonderful characters, is the author's ability to weave a good yarn. Anyone familiar with John Irving's a Widow for One Year or The World According to Garp will adore this book. It charts the course of a family through a lifetime of ups and downs, pain and growth. Read it! It may be long, but every page is worth it."
5,"Our own, modernized Hemmingway...","At a time in which books found on shelves aim for post-modern themes of the fast-paced, rip-roaring, high-speed chase, The Brothers K is no doubt endlessly refreshing. Duncan's book returns readers to an earthy story not visited since the likes of Gatsby or Hemmingway or Salinger. Duncan's novel chronicles family and baseball, Vietnam and religion. It is well-crafted, intelligent, and addicting. Must be read."
1,Help!,"with everyone else LOVING this book, why cant I get past the second chapter?. After reading The River Why I just cant seem to get into this book....What am I missing??? The first two chapters have bored me out of my mind. I found The River Why to be a cherished work of art that I have read over and over, it flows so wonderfully, and yet this book does not. It is almost like it is written by a completely different person. I want to read it I really do. Do I just have to force myself into it.?"
4,i can't remember how many copies i've given to friends,"I discovered this book when i was wandering through a town in northern canada along the alaska highway. i was supposed to be doing some work, but the evenings were dull, i'd read the books i was carrying, and so i wandered into the library and managed a short-term loan.the title caught me as a rip-off, and it was a book-of-the-month selection, but i was a stranger in a strange land.i started, and then did almost nothing else for three days. i cried in a 24 hour trucker's restaurant. some reader before me had smoked hand-rolled cigarettes, fossil sediment of his read was layered by alternated tobacco tendriles and smudged ash.it felt like i was in a community with that other book-loaner, and i felt good that i had shared this book with someone.duncan drew me through the characters to look with compassion at others around me. i feel like a better person for having listened to this story.it is a book you will give away but never lose."
3,"Predictable, but good","I'm not going to make this long or try to summarize the characters and plot like everyone else has, so I'll just give my brief review of The Brothers K.I liked it. I especially liked the first half and the family when they were young. I didn't care much for the second half of the novel, nor the characters as they got older. I found the second half of book to be predictable and corny especially the ending which I found to be rather weak.Mr. Duncan writes beautifully and has a very good sense of humor. As others had stated in their reviews, I also laughed out loud on a couple parts in the beginning, and also shed tears over a confrontation between Kincade and Papa Toe.All in all, I liked it and I'm glad I read it. It's a long one though!"
5,INCREDIBLE AUTHOR! SPECTACTULAR BOOK!,"The Brothers K is filled with spectacular moments of humor,drama, and action. This book is an absolute must-read foranyone who enjoys thinking about the meaning of theirexistence in a very strange world.Although this book is not for baseball lovers only, it hasmany great baseball moments. Especially check out the scenewhere Papa Chance tries to explain the true nature of thestrike zone to his young son!! A ***** scene!! This bookis filled with them!! And don't forget to check-out Duncan'sother all-star novel, The River Why"
5,"Powerful, complex and well written","The Brothers K was my first Duncan book, and I was very pleasantly surprised. The book was a powerful, complex story of a family whose love wasn't always easy and wasn't without a great deal of complexity.I felt the book dragged a bit towards the middle, but the ending was well worth it, as I was crying my eyes out. An exceptional read."
3,"Pretty good novel, but it could've been better...","This was a good book. I liked some of the characters, but some of them weren't very well written."
5,A great book,"this was a required reading for one of my classes in high school. I found out then that I just had to have it for my own. I would recommend this book to anyone if they like baseball, religion, or family values. Its a great read and will want you wanting more of it."
4,The strength of one woman in a family,"David James Duncan wrote the novel, The Brothers K, which depicts the four Chance Family brothers. The novel is written through the voice of the youngest brother, Kincaid, yet the plot also follows the dark life of their mother, Laura Chance. The protagonist of this novel could easily be argued to be many characters, but I believe that the true protagonist is the boys' mother. This novel follows Laura through her horrific childhood, her falling in love, her struggle to be a mother, her devotion to religion, and her coping with the loss of her husband. The strength of this woman is so amazing by the end of the novel, that it practically jumps off the pages."
5,Indescribable,"If you are currently breathing, and have heard of things like: Heros, Americana, Baseball, Religion and Family. If you have ever questioned authority or been questioned by authority. If you have ever been in love. Then you should have started reading this book yesterday. In the words of Duncan himself ""anything worth describing, is indescribable. While reading this book I discovered and experienced emotions that have been dormant in me for a long time - I'm not exagerating. I found myself at times overwhelmed and having to put the book down to regroup. Reminds me a little of Conrad, with stronger and weaker characters. Do yourself a favor."
5,Top 10 book for me,"This is one of my ""stuck on an island"" books. You don't have to love baseball to love this book."
4,Renaissance Women Again,"I bought this book under the impression that it was one I hand't read, but in fact it is 'Uppity Women of the Renaissance' under a different title. It is a very amusing book,, with lots of interesting information about women of the 16th and 17th centuries, but if you already have 'Uppity women of the Renaissance' don't bother to buy this one, because its' the same book."
5,GREAT Quick Reading Book,"This is definately a coffee table or bathroom book... or just one to carry around in your purse for a quick page or two. Each woman has only a page or two devoted to her, so you can quickly get in a short giggle between other goings on!I highly recommend this book and any other by Vicki Leon, if you can find them!"
5,His best project,"IMO, this is Michael Henderson's best cd/lp. Henderson was a major force during his run in the 70's and 80's and he was never better than Goin Places."
5,very Versatile Cat,Michael Henderson is One of those Musicians that you feel everyone should know about. the Brother started out way back in the day doing session work&then made a Solo Career.this Album is tight.Vocals are on Point.strogn arrangements&production. Michael Henderson makes a Bass talks&the versatility on His Vocals will just leave you going WOW!
3,just ok for me,"This was an interesting book and had valid points, but as a teacher I found it difficult to relate to most of the examples given. If you work in another profession you will probably find it more helpful than I did."
4,Not Bad,"Although short, this album is potent and worth a certain amount of money. Fun fact: A song on this album, No More Love, was in the movie Johnny Mnemonic (with Keanu Reeves). I have better music, but every once in a while I listen to this. If you like God Lives Underwater, make sure you check out Empty."
4,Endless adventures on the Edge,"If you like to go into the impossible and dare to go into danger, this is the book for you. This book talks about Quint, an apprentice of two of the most powerful people around where he lives. He figures out a way to save his beloved floating city (Sanctaphrax) from flowing into an eternal winter. As you continue reading, Quint's life starts to unveil itself, and he does things he never thought he could do before. The Winter Knights is a guaranteed page turner!"
5,10 out 10 The True Sailor Moon,"Excellent! 10 out 10! The true story of Sailor Moon! If you're into Manga and Anime, I would recommend this manga 100%. Sailor moon is full or Romance, Adventure, Drama and More. If you like sailor moon you might also like Revolutionary girl Utena another Manga written by Naoko Takeuchi.Sailor Moon in Comic Style with Beautiful Artwork!"
4,solid song,i really dig this song.three of my favorite Artists.Quincy Jones On Production the Man is BAd.Siedah Garrett very talented COmposer&Vocalist.then the Genius OF El Debarge who showcases his Chops here.this is a cool Slow-Jam check it out.
2,Nice images - Knock off the Text games!,"Not a bad book if you like near-dark or dark photography. But the body text of a book is a terrific place to tell your graphic designer to chill out & stop fooling around with type effects. This book adopts a grating ""playful"" approach to text that defies you to read it. 120 page of three to ten enlarged words jumping out at you for no reason. Example p 58:""A high position has given a COMMANDING view. Such IMAGES can have a creative as well as a historic purpose.""I'd pay a few dollars to punch this graphic designer very hard."
2,Hard shoe,the shoe was really hard and offered no support for arch. Hurt the top and bottom of my foot. I wore once and bagged for goodwill.
3,shipping and package was in good condition,"The shipping was fast and the package was in good condition! The book was in good condition, but didn't get to interested in it as i already knew almost all that i started reading in it about blood pressure."
5,matchs my rings!,"I needed some color on my right wrist, and found this that matches the rings that I wear all the time."
5,An excellent change from Empire,"Queensrche has always been on the cutting edge of hard rock. This album is in no way a metal album, it's more like an art rock albumn. It was beautifully engineered and in that perspective has not been matched since ""Operation: MINDCRIME."" Geoff's voice has never sounded better and the guitars are beautiful plus they added instruments and sounds that you won't here on other albums (i.e. saxaphones, a solo piano with vocal, a string quarted, a bar scene, etc). You simply cannot point out another ninties band that sounds like them."
4,"More thought-provoking than ""mindcrime""","I bought this album shortly after its release in 1994, when my life for all intents and purposes was going down the toilet. ""Someone Else"" kind of became my theme song that year, and to this day whenever I hear it it reminds me of not only how horrible everything was then, but how great everything is now. It's definitely the most personal album the Ryche's made, and in a way a concept album in its own right--a man's journey towards self-awareness and acceptance. Not for the novice Ryche listener, and definitely not for the pop fan. After ""mindcrime,"" the best one they ever did."
2,CAn't Feel it,"After amazing albuns ""OPERATION MINDCRIME"" and ""EMPIRE"", this was a disapointment for me. Boring at the extreme, overproduced, it clearly show that the band was already losing their creativity vein."
2,Not a safe bet ........,"Compared to previous Queensryche material this album is JUST BORING.There is only one song I liked "" One more time"". The rest is just a bizarre and abstract concept which leads to nowhere. I am big fan and have been to Queensryche concerts but his album just doesn't make it for me. If you like a soft paced rock album, bizarre lyrics, a still powerful lead singer and have money to spend then go ahead and get it. If you don't want to bet then try ""Operation : Mindcrime"", that is a safe one."
5,Excellent.. much better than Hear In The Now Frontier,These songs just are so cool. I miss the rawness of Mindcrime but oh well. No popular band of today sounds like they did in the 80's(maybe Aerosmith a little). Rock on. QUEENSRYCHE FEVER
1,PROMISED SHAME..,"Boy, this CD is awful Just that. COming after OPERATION MINDCRIME and EMPIRE, it is a total turkey. The sound is flat, commercial, QUEENSRYCHE really never belonged to the true Gods of metal, even if they have some kind of a cult following. In this PROMISED LAND, they promise nothing, just a bunch of bad and boring ""rock"" songs."
2,QUEENSRYCHE GOING DOWN...,"I lost some credibility for Queenryche when they released RAGE FOR ORDER, succumbing to pressures to dress thjemselves like Motley Cure or Poison or Dokken or Bon Jovi. But with EMPIRE and OPERATION... they proved once and for all their autenticity and special place in the metal world. It was hard to follow those two great albuns and one had to be expecting a brief decline in thheir next album. And it came in the form of PROMISED LAND, a really weak album, withou any firm orientation, lacking punch, over produced, totally synthesized."
2,Not what I was expecting,"Far from it! The entire album sounds like ""Electric Requiem,"" not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just that it was only meant to last one minute, and I just can't listen to an hour of that."
3,Not as disappointing as Here In the Now Frontier,"I'm not much of a fan of this album, but it is better than Here in the Now Frontier. Some of the songs just aren't what I expected. It's okay."
2,It took 4 years for this?,"This is an album that will make you sick if you are a fan of Queensryche. Queensryche had never put a unpolished song out until this album. ""Disconnected"" is plain awful and Mr. Tate never sang half assed until ""Someone Else"". Why did they take four years to record an album that is under fifty minutes(includes six plus minutes of garble that worked well on Mindcrime)? The answer: They lost it."
1,A major letdown for hard-core Queensryche fans,Don't waste your money on this one. There are only a couple of good songs-- the others are just plain awful and obnoxious. I have no idea why they put some horrid tracks on this one. What a waste.
3,Michael Langford's 35mm handbook,Good book for learning the basic techniques. Don't expect anything special about composition. Teach the technics in such a way that let you focus in the feeling of the camera.
4,"aerobar comfy, but some minor issues","This aerobar is used on my Felt flatbar roadbike. I take long rides pulling my boys in a burley trailer in the back, and this position helps a lot. However, thye did come loose a couple times, and haven't now for a few years, also the armrests move a bit, which could be a blessing or a curse. All in all, out of all of the others i've seen, this one offers the most versatility in arm/hand position without the high cost. Benefits far outweigh having to tighten a few times in the last 5 or so years."
2,"Good miniatures, Terrible Sorting!","I will keep this very short and to the point: The randomizing of the giant figures in each package is horrible. Out of 4 boxes I received from Amazon, I had 3 duplicates of a single Huge figure. The likelyhood of your Huge figurine being one of the rare ones vs the uncommon ones is also much higher, since the set is more likely to get a rare small figure.I do like them, but for the money it is not as good a deal as some of the other sets."
5,excellent children's book,"I had a chance to see the book when it and its illustrations were on display at the Museum of Children's Art. ""One, Two, Three! This Book 's for Me!"" is well conceived and very educationally oriented. Parents will find it valuable in teaching their children to count and read."
1,too thick to keep as spare,The tube is made out of a thick rubber that does not fold enough to fit under your seat as a spare.
1,Worst book ever,This book was horrible! I would never read this to my children. I was forced to read this for a religious class. Its not worth a penny.
5,Dynabrade Spirit random orbital sander,"I have only used this sander on one project but I have already retired my electric random orbital sanders. This sands two to three times as fast as an electric ROS, is quieter and much lighter. I am using it with a 5 HP, two cylinder 60 gallon Campbell Hausfield vertical compressor and it doesn't seem to have any trouble keeping up with the sander, although I would not try to use it with a smaller compressor. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make the next step up from electric sanders who also has the air capacity available. I will probably buy another one in the future."
2,Very poor brake system,"I have had this walker for almost one year. The size,appearance, and the under seat bag are excellent but the most important thing to me is safety and the brakes are constantly needing adjusting. I have had to replace both brake cables numerous times. Also when I called the company they were less than helpful - they told me to send the walker to them to repair!! I would not purchase this item again and I would not recommend it either."
2,What a disappointment!,"We could not wait to give this airplane to our daughter for her birthday. She is totally crazy about airplanes. I had looked all over for an airplane that actually opens up for the child to place people inside. This one has a working cargo door and the cockpit top is supposed to open and close. Instead, the cockpit top comes completely off everytime my daughter trys to lift the lid. Instead of playing with the plane she is running to us ever 30 seconds asking us to fix her plane.We assumed that this would be a high quality toy like Little Tikes normally produces. We were so disappointed with the plane we returned the unopened one that we had purchased for our nephew."
2,great plane...if it didn't fall apart,"We gave this to my son for Christmas. He loves planes. We found that he played with it for a while, then pieces started to break. The plastic windshield falls off every time it is opened (it flips up to allow access to the cockpit). My son can't put it back together on his own, so he brings it to us every time it happens. The same thing happens with the side door with the stairs. Evey time it opened the come apart. I recommend saving your money and buying something else, unless you have a child who is a Caillou fan (mine is not)."
2,Mediocre Black Nationalist Rantings,"I wanted to read this because I thought the title of the book was hilarious and I've always enjoyed reading black nationalist literature. The more radical and extreme the better. So I had high hopes for Look Out Whitey! He writes in a fairly entertaining ranting style, full of parody, satire and sarcasm but this was pretty mediocre as far as stuff like this goes. Overall a disappointment. Its also too dated to be relevant now and judging by a lot of what he wrote and the title he seemed like he wrote this book as a means to thumb his nose at white people more than for any kind of serious black nationalists. Besides who the hell is Julius Lester anyway? I've read my share of stuff by and about black radicals from the 60s and 70s but I have never heard of him."
3,Loosely dance,"I'm not very much into the Yoga and Chakra so I was a little reserved.But the movements showed in this DVD were fun.The Yoga-exercises were very good illustrated and demonstrated, but to me they were a little bit boring.At last: I realy could not join chanting the mantra's. It's not my thing."
2,waste of money,"I'm a trained dancer and I do yoga occasionally so i was hoping for an intersting alternative work out. What was all that wiggling and arm flinging about? And the hyperventilating huffing and puffing? And the sing along? Seriously, I couldn't throw this into the discard pile fast enough.I was really disappointed after reading such glowing reviews. I'll stick to the FIRM workouts, they almost never disappoint."
2,a little bizzare,"I found this video very interesting. I didnt break a sweat. I found the voiceover very annoying, and most of the time shes just dancing around in circles like a 5 yr old. If your looking for a workout, I definately dont recommend."
3,Eh,"I don't know how to dance and I don't think the chick in the yoga video can either. I feel stupid swaying and swinging my arms around with her. Then there's also the part where she's chanting, which is weird too. She also spins around in a circle for a long time and never explains why. Spinning in a circle makes me feel stupid. A friend walked in on me working out with this video once and asked me what I was doing, all judgmental like, and I panicked and told him I was working out with an exercise tape made by the Hare Krishnas. The sad part is that he believed me--that's how weird this exercise video really is. I have a few other videos made by these people that are better then this one, though. All the tapes made these people don't suck, this dance one is just super weird."
2,Pretty ridiculous.,"I really, really do not understand why this video is so popular. The yoga/breathing portion is nice, (I have been doing yoga for six years), but the ""dancing"" was really more like flailing your arms around in circles. I enjoy many styles of dancing and just found this to be completely boring and uninspiring. The music was uninteresting and I found the many voice overs distracting, not relaxing. The meditation part reminded me of a sing along children's video. I consider myself a spiritual, open minded person, but this is just plain cheesy."
5,"Very Nice ""Workout(?)""","As a 46 year old man who's attempting to get back in tune, I was alittle afraid of this dvd. I have had experience with Kundalini yoga ten through twenty-five years ago. I worked through this video tonight and found it totally enjoyable. And most important(to me) it is GUY FRIENDLY. I look forward to the other kundalini yoga dvds I've ordered to this series."
5,Even if you aren't a super fit healthy yoga nut....,"Okay, at first, Ravi & Ana kind of weirded me out. It's the same thing that always happens with me in yoga. I end up feeling like an idiot, even in my own living room, but if you can get past the feeling silly - it feels GREAT. I think this is a great DVD to start with because it really focuses on being yourself and just having fun expressing yourself. They really hit on the spiritual side of yoga and it's nice to start the day with such uplifting way (both emotionally and physically).I may never understand Ana's living food diet or get into some of the deeper spirituality of it, but I love doing it. It makes me feel good. :)"
1,Dismayed,"I love Yoga of all sorts, find the Chakra's fun and interesting and particularly enjoy Kundalini style yoga.Given my positive expectation and the great reviews I was eager to play Dance the Chakra's as soon as it arrived. To my dismay, I found ana's expressions distracting and have no sense of the quality or lack of quality of the dvd.I struggled through one viewing and am not inclined to revisit this dvd. It could be the greatest dvd in the world, and for many it surely is, but I just don't get the positives.HOWEVER, ana's Kundalini Yoga - A Journey through the Chakras is perfect for creating powerful energy flow. I follow with eyes closed and very much appreciate the experience and after effects. Beautifully chosen elements, simply presented create a very whole and complete class."
2,Choppy,"The first half of the workout felt rather choppy and a lot of the exercises felt very uncomfortable to do with cold/stiff muscles. It might be better to do the dance part of the workout first to warm up the muscles, but since I don't care for the type of dance that was shown, even though it was easy to follow and beautifully demonstrated by Ana Brett, I put the DVD up for sale immediately after doing it."
2,Read reviews before buying...,"...and not just the 4 and 5 stars. I would have given it a one star because I doubt that I would ever use it again, but there were some parts that I thought weren't 1 star worthy. The beginning and the dances that she actually leads in this video were actually kind of enjoyable, but half of the video is 'free dancing'. I cant see doing this video everyday because there are so many other dvds out there that will offer a much more beneficial yoga experience. I do own another Ana/Ravi dvd that is okay even though Ana's nipples are clearly visible through the whole thing, but this dvd is more sexual than anything else. I'd do better going to a club."
3,Not my favorite,"Just moving in general provides benefit, and this falls under that category--but not much greater in my opinion. It's not a well-choreagraphed routine and I felt like I was just dancing along doing my own thing while the instructor did her own thing. Dancing to a music CD (which is great to do too!) wouldn't have felt much different. Personally not my thing."
5,Love it,I don't know much about Yoga. This was my 2nd yoga DVD. I love it. I felt silly at first but I have a 5 year old. I used my imagination and went with it. I had a blast. I got a great work out. I was really sore the next day. I will definitely buy another DVD from this duo.
5,Mood-elevating workout,"Dance the Chakras is an excellent video. Reviewers before me have already done a great job of describing the segments, so I won't go into those. Instead, in case you are feeling at all hesitant about a dance workout as yoga, let me reassure you that you will love this! I am the most awkward dancer out there, and at the end of this dvd, I feel great, happy, self-assured, and positive. It's not about looking a certain way, but feeling a certain way. At the end of this workout, I am always smiling. Beyond the great emotional lift, you'll also be burning calories, and working on balance and flexibility, so you can't lose! Try it, you'll love it!"
3,It's okay...,"The workout was just okay. I was kind of expecting something a little more challenging. If you're a yoga beginner, this workout would probably be great for you. The dance section was... interesting. While I did enjoy not having to worry about following a particular choreography Ana looked kind of odd and it was a bit distracting. Despite that the video did have some good stretches in it so I'm probably going to keep it in my rotation."
5,Beautiful Energy,"I love this DVD so much. It helps you to clear out all the garbage and just let calm in. My well-being goes right through the roof after I do this DVD, no matter how challenging my day has been. The first half of the DVD is the yoga section. It really helps you focus on your body and tune everything else out. The second part is just fun, you can dance your little heart out, especially in the free form section, and just let your body choose the direction. It's quite freeing. This is a workout for your spiritual self through the physical body and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to connect with themselves a little bit more. :)"
5,A very pleasant surprise,I bought this based on reviews and was very glad I did. I am finding out I am stronger and more flexible than ever. The music is pretty good on this tape too. I'm going to check out the other DVD's by Ana and Ravi.
4,Over all its a very nice watch but...,"I saw this and other Seiko watches at Macys. I wanted something elegant and stylish, possibly with Black dial. And I believe this watch has all of what I wanted. The chain design is simple and nice; unlike most chains it would not make you look like a hip hop artist, its not overly shinny or faded. Not heavy either.The only thing I did not like about the watch were the hands. The hour and minute hand is metallic silver. The hands' design is unique and I like it but with everything else silver/black, it makes it a little hard to see the hands. White may have been the best color for hands. Initially I was a little frustrated because I could not see the hour or minute hands if the light was reflecting on the watch. I was thinking about returning it but then someone told me that it looks really great on me. I changed my mind and now I think I am getting used to it.Perpetual Calendar would have been nice feature."
4,"Great design, but begs for Perpetual Calendar","PROS:This is a great looking watch, I couldn't believe it when I saw it in the stores because it looks so much better than it does in the standard promotional photos available everywhere online. I will try to post some of my own photos.. The bottomline is: it has a lot of shine to it... The small dials have a very elegant and thin metal shiny ring around them. Overall the watch has the perfect mix between silver color and black color.Also the watch is not too heavy. It's not very light.. but the weight is very easy to get used to. It's about 60 grams.CONS:For a watch costing [...] more.. Seiko should have included a Perpetual Calendar... This is the type of calendar where you don't have to worry about months which differ from 30 days and leap years. With this one, you have to adjust it for those months manually. There's no way to tell it if it's January or Febuary.[...]"
4,Great watch but hands are invisible in low light,"This watch is great looking, keeps great time, and has a lot of features. It is a manly watch without being an over the top giant hunk of metal. The only drawback that I have found is that the hands are very hard to see in low light."
4,Delightfun and out of print,Sometimes a little treasure gets left behind and time rushes past letting it go out of print. This is a nice little read. A few of its themes are simply brilliant for its time and the frequent yet not overdrawn action keeps you reading. It is kept short and sweet but its deliberate and frequent jumps in setting do not leave much room for character development or exploration of the books many worlds.
2,"Interesting premise, but poorly written","A scientist is murdered, but his consciousness bouncesforward in time, ever forward, until . . .This might have been a good book, if only Maine (really DavidMcIlwain) had been a decent writer. Might as well wishthat Maine had never written it, but that a greater talent,John Varley for example, had done it 25 years later. But,that's a plot for another book."
2,Repeat over and over...,After songs 1-5 there is nothing else to listen too. I would not suggest buying this album but only cd write the songs you want from it.
4,This CD is a classic!,"This CD is a must for any true mowtown fan. ""Let's Stay Together"" is possibly the greatest song ever."
3,Some oldies but goodies,"Although I was not pleased with all the songs on this recording, the ones I wanted was there. Brought back memories galore. I recommend it ."
5,Never gets old,"I grew up listening to Al Green in my mom's car as she shuffled us back and forth from school to practice to home. I remember watching my mom's head bob up and down to the music and then noticing my head bobbing up and down too. Twenty some odd years later I am still bobbing my head to this man. Al Green is an amazing musical force and never gets old. This CD in particular captures all of his great songs. My favs are: #1, #3, #,4, #5, #6, and #7. Unfortunately ""How do you mend a broken heart"" is not on this album but lyrically is one of his best. I love his music and will definitely pass it on to my kids one day!"
3,Yet another reissue of this compilation.,"I must first say that this review is NOT meant to disparage or criticize Al Green or his music but to point out why you should not buy this CD. For starters, the sound quality is NOT better than on the 1995-issued The Right Stuff reissue of this album. Second, the five bonus tracks featured on the 1995 edition are not included here--yet this is still a full-priced CD! Al Green was most definitely one of the most important and influential male R&B singers of the 1970s but I'd recommend going with original albums like ""Let's Stay Together"", ""Call Me"", ""Al Green Explores Your Mind"" and ""I'm Still In Love With You"" instead of this compilation which (perhaps unnecessarily) gets reissued yet again."
4,"""let's stay together"" is short version...","for what it's worth, the version of ""let's stay together"" on this cd is 3:18 versus the 4:50 version on greatest hits, volume one. i assume shorter version contained here was the radio edit. otherwise a very nice collection"
5,"""Al Has It Going On!!""","These Greatest Hits of Al Green are MAGNIFICENT. A TERRIFIC music CD for all those lovers out there, and for those that are not in love, too. The songs on this music CD will surely put you in a loving mood. I would definitely recommend this CD to any and everyone. Al Green has it going on with the songs on this CD from ""Tired of Being Alone"" to ""Belle"" Al has what it takes, whether to put you in a relaxing mood or the mood for love. This CD definitely has what it takes."
5,I LOVE MUSIC,I LOVE HEARING ALL TYPES OF MUSIC.ESPECIALLY AL GREENS MUSIC HE IS A LEGEND TO ME PLEASE LET ME SAMPLE A FEW SONGS FROM HIM.
2,Some songs on here are NOT great hits.,I believe there are better Al green albums out there that give you better hits. Some of these songs i would never consider as Al's great hits.
3,let's say ok,"sound,not very good at all,thought it was digitally remastered on LET'S STAY TOGETHER TINA TURNER makes him sound---ugh ... so much for AL!"
5,Hot Damn!,"Old Al is just timeless. Brings back the happy memories of high school when this scared white girl was bused to Northside High. His music helped bridge that gap. Listening to Al still makes me want to sing and dance and helps uplift me even on my gloomiest days. His upbeat music had a spirtual essence, even then. My husband likes him now and he never was a fan before. Great CD and great price!"
4,Praise the reverend,"His vocals are deep rich chocolate that can melt anyone. You can tell he pours his heart into ""Belle"" and his use of horns is amazing. If you listen to D'angelo's Voodoo you can see where he got his influence. Al Green's Greatest Hits are a must have in any hard-core R&B collection."
4,not happy,I love al Green but this CD didn't have my favorite song love and happiness. Still I enjoy it and had no problems with it.
5,A Must Have,"This is a must have for anyone with an R&B ""oldies"" collection. You won't be disappointed."
5,How smooth can you get?,"These songs are always smooth and sexy but never degenerate into being outright raunchy. Al Green's vocals are amazing. He can make you high with his barely restrained voice and put you over the top with his incredible visceral screams. His vocal stylings are entirely appropriate for the gospel music he sings now, but we should all be glad that he chose different subject matter to sing about during his 70's peak. All the songs on this compilation are great, obviously, but the standout track in my opinion has got to be ""I Can't Get Next to You."" The beat is slow and hard, and Al is both singing and talking the lyrics. This song never fails to be repeated on my CD player.I like Marvin Gaye, but I go with Al Green if I want to hear something more raw. Don't pass up a chance to hear or get this CD. It'll probably help you to ""get in the mood"" if nothing else."
5,LOVE AND HAPPINESS,"FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T HAVE ANY AL GREEN MUSIC THIS IS THE CD TO START WITH. IT HAS ALL HIS BIGGEST HITS. I HAVE THE ORIGINAL RECORD AND THEY ADDED FIVE MORE HITS PLUS THEY CHANGED TRACK #5 TO ""LOVE AND HAPPINESS"" FROM HIS VERSION OF THE BEE-GEES ""HOW CAN YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART."" YOU CAN'T HAVE AN AL GREEN COLLECTION WITHOUT ""LOVE AND HAPPINESS."""
5,Feedback,The product arrived just as it was supposed too. I would definitely use this consumer again. I was very satisfied.
4,Classic,"Not much to say. He has his classic songs on the album. There were a few songs that I questioned for being on the album, but I still like the album"
1,You must hate someone to buy this book,"Why would you buy this over other books?You could easily buy an actual Japanese How to Draw Manga book series (a lot of books are compiled and drawn by actual artists, e.g.How To Draw Manga Volume 8or any of the other books with that same graphic title), but you would have to hate someone to buy them something like this. Or this has to be a gag gift of some form.This isn't teaching you how to draw anything -- rather it's a compilation of bad art and technique. Just don't."
4,Good book for beginners,"I am a total beginner drawer. I recommend tryingthe various websites on drawing animation and thengetting this book. It is very good for the basicsand show you what to do step by step. It willalso allow you some success very quickly whichhelps to build confidence even if you don'treally care about drawing manga. Most beginnerslike we dont want to spend 3 days completing astill life, so this is a good book to start withThe biggest mistake I have made so farwas trying to skimp on materials, youwill REALLY need a kneadable eraserand india ink along with the book."
1,? this is manga ?,"I didnt buy this. Just happened to notice it on amazon. And, HELLO, U CALL THIS MANGA?!?!?!?!?!?!?! no, no, no. the cover is HORRIBLE, doesnt even look like manga... guys, DONT waste ur money on this, buy MarkCrilley's book instead. Believe me, im 11, and i can draw better than this person...."
2,This was my first Manga-book.,"This was my frist manga book, and it taught me a lot of bad habbits that, as a young artist, were very difficult for me to shake.However, the book was written by a sixteen year old girl, who I'm aure has improved since then in her style.Bad book for starting off, but the author should be proud of having written it."
2,Not for any REAL manga fans...,"No offense to people who disagree, but this book is completely for amateurs. My friend bought this at a school book fair and she gave it a shot, and she liked it. For a little while. It's okay for little kids, but it can often confuse them. True mangakas will scoff at how it concentrates mostly on inproportionate chibis. The pictures on the cover may look good, but after looking at them for a while you'll realize how unprofessional they look. And did I mention that they're mostly in colored pencil? The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that you don't have to worry about 'anatomy lessons' for the upper half of a female, if you know what I mean. So you can buy it for a kid with no worries. But other than that, it's only worth the price of the paper in it."
3,Beginner's art,"This book I purchased at the reading fair at my school. I read it and realized it was a waste of 7.00$. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't for me. I had already trained myself in manga art, and this book is for beginners. Experienced artists will find this droll and useless. The art is mediocre, and my sister, who was at the time, 17, was not pleased that a 17 year old who wasn't as good as she herself was, got a book deal. this is a perfect beginners book, and a good tool, but if you are looking for artwork of excellence, advanced techniques, or special tips, don't bother."
1,Horrible teaching tool,"If you are serious about becoming an artist, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK. It will do nothing but hurt you. It does not go into the very important details of drawing, and without these things you will never get anywhere. Katy Coope is not an accomplished manga artist, so therefore has NO FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE... I purchased this book when I started out and have spent 3 YEARS RECOVERING my drawing style.A definate PASS for anybody who is thinking about buying this..."
1,It sucks and she's not even talented.,"This book is horrible and a waste of money, time, and energy.The artist is so, not talented and if you like this book, go buy yourself some taste in books. It's in the supermarket next to the ""get a brain"" aisle."
4,A great starting point for basics,"i had goting this book when i was 9 or some were around there and it's not a bad starting point for the basics, back then i had no ideal how to draw most manga/anime body's and this helped me step by step on how to draw back then, like i said it's good for basic's i'm giving it a 4 out of 5, for it teaches you how to draw body's not eye's, hair or shading"
2,Wrong product,"Right title, wrong author. This wasn't what I was expecting to get, but it was useful nonetheless."
2,Not typically for beginners,"There are only two American artists in the profession that are great at mastering the japanese style of manga and Katy Coope is not one of them. If you are serious of wanting to draw manga or you want to learn the correct technique of drawing manga then I suggest you focus more on the Japanese ""How To Draw Manga"" books. Don't go in a panic...they are not in Japanese but in English. So I would look up ""How To Draw Manga"" or go to howtodrawmanga.com for better books than this because this book is a BIG diappointment to maga and anime."
1,Don't make my mistake,"I got this book at a school book fair when I was eleven or twelve and loved it. I wasn't so much into anime/manga, but I loved how easy the style was to copy. NO. Big mistake. Today at nearly 21 years old, I'm still trying to undo the bad habits this book taught me. Katy Coope's drawing style wasn't a style at all - rather, it was a series of errors caused by not studying the human body. Her more recent work still reflect many of these errors as well. I understand that she was in her mid-teens when she made the book so you can't really blame her, but whoever gave it the OK to be published was being extremely irresponsible. I know many other artists who are trying to undo what this book taught them as well.If you are planning to buy this book for a young artist, don't. It can only hurt them."
3,A manga fan,"I think that this book is really basic. Unless you are just starting out, you really don't need this book. However, if you are just staring out and want to draw faves then this is the book for you. The author goes into great detail on the faces (exept for the fact that she only draw knoses in one small section). She does, however, skimp on the bodies. She doen't actually show you haw to draw them. This is a good book though, and it's a necesity for beginners."
2,For kids,"This is not good for anyone above the age of twelve or thirteen. Explanations are incredibly simplistic, everything is colored with pencils, and it's quite a short book.This might be good for someone who is just learning to draw, but does not go into depth of technique. Everything is very basic without much detail. Also, the author's finished drawings are not very good."
3,Not Quite What I Was Looking For,"I have recently become very interested in drawing manga, so I bought this book. When I received it, I was quite excited, but soon realized that it wasn't what I was looking for. It is a small book with just over sixty pages. I am a slow artist, and found that the tutorials were too fast for me with the steps being fast, as in not enough information. This books is great for technique, but for one who cannot draw to save their life, it was not very helpful."
4,Good for Starters,"This book is good for starters who are just beginning to recognize their love for Manga, like me.I'm no professional in drawing so this is why I said that, I read the other reviews and they sum up about how this book is for beginners but not professionals who want more, and I agree.Would I recommend this book?Yes, I will because it is a good book for starters mainly because of the step-by-step instructions. That will give Beginners an idea of how some Manga is drawn, but with that comes improvement. So don't worry if this book doesn't teaches the professional drawings, but things take time, and this book helps Starters get threw that ""time""."
5,Excellent book,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is very well written and true to the gospel message. It is also a good adventure story, so I would recommend it to Christians and non-Christians."
5,It is a very special!,"When you first begin reading you will know inside whether it is for you personally.In this world today, humans need to know other paths that can be taken.Now, take the first step by opening, and you with either be drawn into reading more, or you will refuse this wonder piece of writing."
5,Beautiful History,"I happen to love Jesus and I am enthralled with history and reading classics. All three of these fit ""The Robe"". This book was a bit long to get through, but the story was beautifully written and adds a dimension to the life of Christ that we do not read about in the Bible. I found it to be a wonderful companion to the Truth and highly recommend it to anyone looking for more depth and rounding out of their understanding of Who Jesus is. I also really liked the fact that what the protagonist goes through in the story, around 2000 years ago, can be applied to how we respond to Christ yet today. Searching? Take a bit more time than you usually spend on a book and find ""The Robe""."
5,Amazing,"I fell in love with this book the first time I read it. From a Christian theological standpoint things might be considered a bit ""off."" But, from a pure entertainment and ""feel good"" book this book is great! After I got done reading it I really found myself wanting to try to live by some of the ways the main character started trying to live near the end of the book. This book will keep you turning page after page! Highly Recommended!"
5,Great!,A book my mother kept and re-read. She enjoyed the movie based on this book as well. I'm pleased to have added it to my personal library.
5,Inspiring,A moving and beautiful tale of one man's journey of faith. It challenged me to live more deeply in my own faith. It is now on my favorites list!
5,Awesome book!,I couldn't put it down! My wife asked for this book so I purchased it and read it before she had a chance to start it. You must put this on your reading list.
5,Historical fiction that stirs the soul.,"I generally approach historical fiction with some degree of skepticism. As my online review of ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" indicates, I am all-too-quick to dismiss historical fiction -- especially Christian historical fiction -- in favor of Scripture.This is, by no means, to say that ""The Robe"" is on a level with Scripture. All I suggest is that ""The Robe"" is remarkable in its portrayal of the earliest Christian community. Like ""Greatest Story Ever Told,"" this novel is inspiring and engrossing. The characters have depth, and one is pulled toward them and their physical, emotional, and spiritual struggles.Much to my surprise, I'm giving ""The Robe"" a 5-star rating -- it was a wonderful surprise! (The movie version was a BIG disappointment, however -- READ THE BOOK)"
4,"Good writing, thoughtful philosophy.","This is a highly readable tale of one of the Roman soldiers who crucified Christ, and won Christ's robe as a gambling prize. Its main weaknesses are that the plotting is only fair (a little too much time spent journeying through Galilee), and the characters are not as convincingly drawn as one might like. I'd give it 3 stars, except that there is a depth in its philosophy that makes you stop and think. I don't agree with Douglas about everything, but I think he comes close to capturing the essence of what Christianity was all about before it became codified and encrusted with ritual and windy sermonizing, and why it was such a revolutionary idea. It still IS a revolutionary idea, in this age of free markets, ""economic man,"" and unabashed greed. This book has made me think about trying to apply its principles in my everyday life, and very few books achieve that."
2,Didn't care for it.,"I know many people love this book, but I just didn't care for it. I never really got attached to the characters and had a hard time with the incessant retelling of the stories of Jesus. I am a Christian and love the stories of Jesus, but just could never really get into this book. Also, there was a rather abrupt ending with many loose ends."
4,Great inspiring book,"I read this book many years ago and had forgotten the details. I remembered it as a great story, so I wanted to read it again and make sure that it was appropriate for my children to read. Well, I had a great time reading it again. It is an inspirational story and I recommend it. I specially like the fact that this is one of the older copies of the book. It is in very good condition and it even had the sleeve. It was exactly as advertised."
4,"Great book, poor edition.",I really enjoyed this book but the kindle edition I purchased was disappointing. It was poorly edited when it was converted to the kindle format and had numerous spelling and puctuation errors. A book this good deserves better!
5,Don't judge this by the movie!,"This is one of the very BEST books I have EVER read!!! When I was about 3/4 of the way through it, the film happened to be on TV, so I decided to watch it and compare it to the book. It was like watching a totally different story. My opinion is that the film version was written to highlight and play up Richard Burton rather than to tell the story of the book.This IS a CLASSIC that you MUST read, especially if you are a Christian!I believe it is so well written, and I could not put it down. I plan on rereading it regularly!!!"
5,The Robe,"We are reading ""The Robe"" for our book club. Everyone who is reading it says they can't put it down. It is a great historical fiction. It gives a different perspective from other characters' view point."
2,Slooowww......,"It was interesting enough to make me want to finish it but it was really slow, at least in my opinion. And I am a bit puzzled as to what Lloyd Douglas' philosophy really is. Did he believe that Jesus really performed real miracles? Or did he think that there was a scientific explanation for them?.He never elaborates."
1,Faulty history,"Douglas has two characters living in Rome in the reign of Tiberius: a ""Prince Gaius"" and Caligula, the future emperor. At first I was puzzled as to who this Gaius was, or why Douglas felt the need to introduce such a fictional character - - until I realized that he obviously wasn't aware that they are the same person! Caligula (""little boot"") was Gaius's nickname. My impression is that Douglas read the main ancient sources, Tacitus's ""Annals"" and Suetonius's ""Lives of the Caesars"". Tacitus refers to Caligula as ""Gaius"" throughout, but the the part of his work dealing with his reign is lost. So Douglas apparently did not realize that the ""Gaius"" playing a crucial role in the last years of Tiberius's reign was the same person as the later emperor Caligula.Sorry, but if Douglas can't get right something as basic as *that*, then I really can't take seriously any of his claims of having conducted a serious historical research.From this point of view, the movie is actually much better."
1,"Ordered in March, still waiting for it in May",I have never had a problem with anything before when purchasing a product from Amazon. The estimated shipment time I was given for this product was totally inaccurate. I'm still waiting for a book I ordered In March. It is now the third week in May.
5,An Outstanding Film,"Enjoyable film to watch time and time again. Good organization. One of the best musical productions of the 1960s. The sones, dance numbers, and performers are all outstanding."
5,What a soundtrack!,I wish I would have gotten this a long time ago. I never knew soundtracks could be so much fun! My whole family enjoys singing along with these songs and visioning the movie while we sing. Even my husband enjoys singing Chim Chim Cher-ee! The price is amazing to boot.Perfectly pleased.
5,Master Piece!,I love this CD! It is a collection of master pieces by the Sherman brothers. The music is fun to dance to and is a great way to brighten up your day. I love turning on my CD player and listening to Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke sing thier hearts out. This is my favorite album in my collection. It is fun for the whole family wheather you are a baby or a teen or an adult or a senior. I am a teen and I LOVE it.
4,my girls dream,my daughter loved it with it had come in on time was promised for christmas got it for new years last year.
5,Practically Perfect in Every Way,"Finally, the Mary Poppins soundtrack I have dreamed of for the last 40 years. Yes, there are bits of music missing that I would have liked them to have included, by who can quibble when one finally has the complete Jolly Holiday sequence? And so much else. Thank you, Disney, all is forgiven."
4,Great crime thriller.,Frank Sinatra did a great job in this TV movie. It is a solid story of how retribution can get out of hand. The story took place in then current times the 70s and still holds up well today. Sinatra is solid as the lead detective and has a supporting cast of stellar character actors.Two of the actors are personal favorites. Harry Gaurdino and Henry Silva are excellent in this film. Both steal scenes when ever they appear on screen.This is a great nights entertainment and solid Sinatra entry in his detective movies.
5,Good story. Cast of first rate actors.,"Sinatra was not only a great singer but a competent actor. Great watching him as a detective. Disc is first quality with no hiss, blurs or other problems."
3,old Chicago,"It's true the book drags a bit, but if you enjoy mysteries set in Chicago circa 1940 then this is for you. The atmosphere of the Chicago mansion and later the chase in downtown Chicago below street level is lots of fun. The plot is actually pretty good. I think the writing is a bit stilted and the main character of the aged Professor Westborough who aids the police (also in other books by Clason)just is pretty boring this time around. The other characters are mainly stick figures as well such as the pretty young thing under suspicion. But I have enjoyed these books and am happy I bought this one too."
3,Golden Age mystery disappoints,"PLOT: Printer Jonas Wright is found slain with an antique weapon in a locked room in his house. Suspects include his two sons, his daughter, his wife, a servant and her ex-con brother, as well as a recently fired employee and his partner. Thanks to an alarm system, it appears that the job was done by someone inside the house. Police detective Mack enlists the aid of his friend Lucius Westborough who is curious about the dead man's notebooks which are written in code.REVIEW: With a promising set-up, including a pair of locked rooms, a finite number of suspects, and a secret code to decipher, this looked like a winner from the golden age. But the promise is never realized, and the plot drags on ponderously. Westborough is a little too much like John Dickson Carr's Dr. Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale, but more boring."
1,The worst movie I ever saw,All the people who had something to do with the making of this horrible movie including all the actors should find over kinds of work and stop wasting their time. It's hard to believe no one even tried to stop production of this God awful and tasteless written and acted movie. It's just plain sad. If you haven't seen Victor Victoria with Juli Andrews watch that instead.
5,A classic in the specialty and still a must.,"Very few books on furniture - Chinese or otherwise - do as successful a job. Not only is the history discussed and the pages well illustrated (in black and white), but timeless scholarly discourse is offered and revealing disective drawings provided. This is a must and you will see how the author has laid the foundation for more recent works on the subject since it has become vogue."
4,A good book...,Good book but it would have been nice to have more detail about the joinery and construction basics of Chinese furniture.Still it's a nice one...
2,chinese domestic furniture,"I think the drawings of furniture were adequate representations. The drawing and images were in black and white. If you planned to build your own Chinese-style furniture, I think you will find this book helpful."
2,Wobbles,I have this currently. I am not at all happy with it. First I find it was made in China. I thought buck knives were made in the US. I now find myself corrected. But then if you're not paying attention when you open it your thumb will slip and land on the serrations. Some practice will reduce the occurrence of that. But what really grinds me is the blade is constantly loose and wobbles. If you tighten down the screws it is too stiff and you go back to landing your thumb on the serations when you open it. If you get it just right then it comes loose in a couple weeks and you are back to wobbling.Not happy and thinking about a replacement.One pro: It is comfortable in the hand.
4,Solid Knife,"Very happy with the knife. Not too many bells and whistles (which may be a good thing), but good construction and pretty durable. The only negative is that the belt clip flairs out a little too much at the end which makes it get caught on a few things..."
5,Excellent companion to Visual Arts Studies,"Like most of my Amazon purchases, I initially borrowed this book from my university library. I liked it enough to purchase and will remain indefinitely in my growing library collection. The bulky size of this book belies its concise and clear nature, which is a boon for any student attempting to wade through the more dense, wordy literature of some other books on the Philosophy of Art. As the blurb on the rear of the book states, it contains 52 chapters written by leading international scholars which cover pretty much all aspects of aesthetics.Structurally, the book's layout makes it easy to locate pertinent information quickly. The chapters are divided into sections which discuss the history, theory, issues and challenges of aesthetic theory; and then looks at the individual arts such as film, photography, dance, theater and music (to name a few. Each chapter concludes with a reference list and a further reading list."
1,MISSING CHAPTERS!,"I am reading this book in conjunction with the 3rd edition of ""Philosophy of the Arts: An Introduction to Aesthetics"". This book is heavily cited as a preferred background/in-depth companion. At the end of Chapter Six in ""Philosophy..."", citation is made to chapters 30, 46, 47, 48 and 49 in this book. However, the Kindle edition of this book ends at chapter 46. Is this because it's only the first edition? Or is it because the Kindled edition simply does not include those chapters? While clearly the material is both compelling and important, it is alarming that such a significant portion of the book appears to be missing. Having paid well over $50 for the pair of books, I'd expect them to at least be complete."
4,Beauty and the beasts,"I first saw this outstanding volume in the bookstore of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Now it is on my shelves (or by my bedside!) in Colorado and I find it indispensable. Anyone curious to know what beauty is - or what ""experts"" thought ot to be - should have it. Otherwise they may remain ""un-aesthetized""."
2,Had a hole,I think overall the glove was a decent glove but the 1 that I got had a hole in one of the fingers. It fit really well.
3,seven short stories with illustrations,"this is a 96 page paperback of some short stories. these stories were of average intensity. the best onei thought was,""the rescue"" by charles.a.piddock. it is about a man abusing a dog and WHO gets the lastlaugh(or bark?)...heh,heh,heh."
1,feminists unite!,I thought this book looked more like how to be a feminist than anything else. I was so disappointed that it doesnt deal with issues my daughter cares about. She wasnt even interested in flipping through it. What a waste of money.
5,Loved it...,"I just recently bought this cd and fell inlove with it the same way i fell in love with everclear when i first saw them. you have to listen to the cd a couple times to actually hear it, for me, it reminded me of hearing everclear live in concert. if you are thinking about buying this great cd, listen closely to the audio samples. i personally fell in love with fire maple song and evergleam. this cd deserves 5+ stars. thank you so much everclear!"
4,"Enough raw energy, but lacking technical skills...","While possesing the smart lyrics and talented vocals necessary for a good CD, this CD seems to lack the disipline used in their other CD's, Sparkle and Fade and So Much for the Afterglow. In this CD, Everclear proves their talent well. The emotions just burn through your speakers. Although I highly reccomend this CD, I belive you should buy Sparkle and Fade or So Much for the Afterglow to get a true idea of Everclear's obvious talent."
5,EVERCLEAR'S GREATEST!!,"A DEFINATE BUY FOR ALL EVERCLEAR FANS! If you like Everclear, then buy this CD. It's that simple. It is one of their best. If you liked Sparkle and fade you'll love ""Fire Maple Song"" and ""Pensilvania is.."" This is the real Everclear. When I first got it I like it a little. Read the lyrics and listen to a few times and you'll love it. You'll never believe they made it with less than $500."
5,Essential Everclear,"Most people who like everclear either got hooked with their sophmore album ""sparkle and fade"" or the next one ""So much for the afterglow."" Sparkle is a punk rockin' album with some really deep lyrics. Afterglow is a bit more ""adult contemporary"", a bit more mainstream.For fans of Sparkle, ""World of Noise"" is an essential look back at Everclear's punk rock roots. The album is less polished than Sparkle. Everclear keeps it simple: guitar, bass, drums, vocals. No synthesizers, no string quartets, no piano, no ukulele (thank god!)The best two songs on the album demonstrate the range Everclear is capable of with just guitar,bass, and drums. First, ""fire maple song"" is a poignant acoustic/electric song that starts slow and drives home hard. ""nervous and weird"" is a fast-paced rock that follows the KISS principle (keep it simple stupid!), snap the drum sticks, enter guitar, enter some vocals, play a few verses, go to guitar solo, finish screaming. Nothing fancy, just good rockin'!"
2,Good Story Ruined by Author,"I hate it when an author takes a perfectly good [true] story and ruins it with a lousy writing style filled with too much preaching and garbage that detracts from the story.The parts about the horse himself and his intelligent abilities were great.The rest of the book is not worth reading. I just skimmed over those parts.It was an easy book to put down except when I was reading about the horse himself.This story would be great had a different author done the writing.This author, however, was a terrible choice for such a magnificent story."
2,"Not ready for prime time, player.","Deion Sanders was a professional athlete in both baseball and football. Like many athletes in the 1990s, he decided to be a rapper, too. He isn't a very good rapper, though. Most of the album consists of Deion bragging about what a great athlete he is. It's pretty boring, actually."
5,Gift for a beginning Chef,Bought this as a Christmas gift for a new Chef interested in starting their own catering business. So far they love it and find it very helpful.
4,informative,"this book is packed with useful info and very easy to read. some topics covered are plain common sense, but all in all, it is a great book for the passionate beginner."
5,The right book for the job,"This book has it all for the home based and start up caterer. It has great tips and suggestions, as well as how to get started. I found everything I wanted to know in this book."
1,Ilegal to cater from home,"Although the concept of this book is appealing, it is ILLEGAL by health department standards to cater from any home kitchen UNLESS it is fully licensed and certified as a commercial kitchen. Hopefully, this author is not giving permission to folks to attempt to cook and deliver food from home kitchens, which is completely against health department rules."
3,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"I originally bought this book because my husband and I are interested in starting a catering business in the next couple of years. I'm currently a culinary student and will be graduating next month. I've worked with caterers and have catered on my own.With all due respect for Denise Vivaldo's accomplishments, I was disappointed with the content of this book. It provided a lot of information on a high-level overview, but it did not give the detailed information I was looking for.I would recommendThe Professional Caterer's Handbook: How to Open and Operate a Financially Successful Catering Business. It's a bit spendy and more like an encyclopedia but the information is extremely useful and the money well spent."
5,The most valuable book ever written.,"For those who live on earth, this is the most valuable book ever written for the health of your body."
5,your body's many cries for water,"I really recommend reading this book, it is a real eye opener, specially for a person like myself who lives on raw food to improve my failing health and is never thirsty. I will start drinking more water today and firmly believe that me aches and pains will go away with this simple remedy. A must for all of you out there who are really interested in the fundamentals of good health"
5,have a question,"I have read Dr. Batman's book and have found it quite interesting. I have a question for those who have been at it longer than I. I have just finished my 2nd week of water, salt and 1/2 hour of daily walking. My angina is gone, but my blood pressure and asthma are not changed. How long should it take to see a change? Am I being too impatient or is it not working for me? Thanks."
2,It works,"My systolic blood pressure dropped 30 points and and my diastolic dropped 20 points--in a week by just drinking a gallon of water a day and taking a 30 minute walk. I found the book facinating. It was a little technical so I will have to re-read some places. But the logic was sound and easily followed. I thought there was too much time spend over discussions concering the rejection of the medical community of the concept. I had come to the conclusion that the medical community and the drug community may not have my best interest at heart years ago, so I would have prefered the space to be more focused on techniques and daily management approaches. But let there be no doubt, this was a book that has changed my life and I am sending a copy to my friends in need. Buy it. (ratchfom@aol.com)"
5,Good old common sense for a change,"Have you ever had a book change your life? This one did for me. I went from 325# on a 5'11"" frame to 220# in 8 months after reading and realizing how I was depriving myself of the most basic element for sustaining life.This book not only shows you how water cures weight problems but numerous other things and it just plain makes common sense. The author exposes how the medical industry ignores this simple cure with countless medications that have a multitude of side effects and don't work as good as plain old water.The Author is a Medical Doctor and is not ignorant, he believes there is a time and a place for medication, but water fits the bill more often than not. The book is also a good read as the author describes how he cured thousands in a middle east concentration camp with the only thing they let him have....water."
4,"Dr. Batman has ""Vision""","I enjoyed Dr. Batmanghelidj's book to the fullest. As a former college athlete, I was not aware of what a key role water plays in the body. Dr. Batman goes in to meticoulous detail of how water replenishes anti-bodily fluids and sustains a strong nutritional value. Im amazed that even in today's health care economy, the essence of water is heavily underated. From the initial stages on digestion to the culprit's of dehydration, Dr. Batman's enduring research on water's effect on the body has solidified water as my only choice!"
5,My Body WAS Crying!,"I couldn't wait to get this book and read it after I learned about it. It is a WONDERFUL book. If I could afford it, I would buy this book for everyone I love. I wouldn't dream of lending it out, but it seems I am telling everyone I know about it, and making some people sit while I read to them. It is true, how we all seem to get on 'continual treatment meds', and we could get off a lot of them if we just drank the proper amounts of water. It has been a lifesaver for me already. The facts were right in front of me. We ARE starving ourselves of water. I have had this book for two weeks, and I already can feel the rewards of drinking the proper amounts of water. I have already eliminated taking my fluid pills and my high blood pressure pills. I feel that I haven't even reaped in the full benefits as yet. I can't thank Dr. Batman enough for publishing this book. If you are wondering if this book is worth the money, and can help you, the answer if YES!!!!"
4,I handled low back pain within three days with only water!,"I woke up one morning with extreme subluxation of my low back vertebrae. I could BARELY get out of bed. I had no choice, I had to go to work. I somehow managed to get up and once I was up, I was better. It was the getting up that was the problem. I didn't feel like going to a chiropractor. I thought about it, and realized I'd recently read the book by Dr. Batmanghelidj and that this might be a cry for water. I kept a glass of water nearby all day, every day for three days. I found that my body would reach for the water on its own accord every few minutes. I drank about a liter and a half of water every day for three days, and at the end of that time the back pain was completely gone! I have since used water to also get rid of headaches, vague illnesses and other things that come and with water, go. I think what the doctor is saying has some truth to it."
1,"nonscientiffic ,dont waste your time.","Strictly unqualified hear say. No research data. No scientific research. Water as snake oil. More water cures all! His proof is thinner than water,in fact thinner than air. save your money,save your time.,"
3,"Generally good, take care with the chapter on AIDS","Dr. Batmanghelidj has written a generally good book whose core advice of ""drink more water"" has helped me a great deal physically. For this I would give it five stars. However, the book has two big flaws:1. Some careful editing, more citations, and an index would improve this book considerably.2. The chapter on AIDS is problematic. ....The AIDS chapter focuses not on water, but amino acids. The doctor believes that AIDS is not caused, initially, by a virus, but rather by an amino acid imbalance. This is a debatable hypothesis .... .... Read the chapter concerning the digestive system first (Dr. Batmanghelidj specializes in digestive research, and makes more sense in this chapter), the chapter on AIDS last, and everything else in between.The core advice of this book is harmless and potentially helpful; take care with the rest."
3,Origin of Man From Salt Water?,"The overall content of the book is outstanding in understanding the physiological benefits of water and our commitment to drink enough to balance our systems. I have had good results since beginning the goal to drink the prescribed daily amounts vs not drinking any water prior to reading his book. However, there is great concern with the content on page 5 (paragraph one) that explains his position on the role of water. He states: ""The role of water itself in the body of living species, mankind included, has not changed since the first creation of life from salt water and its subsequent adaptation to fresh water. From a biblical perspective, man did not come from salt water but from God's creation. (Genesis 1) Thus is the author acknowledging evolution by fish to the development of land animals? Welcome others comments"
1,Don't buy this book,I bought this book thinking it will help my health. This is a book with a fancy cover but beyond that a bunch of boring dry babble. The book itself feels really cheap and many of the pages have errors. I read the whole book. Did it help my health? No. I read this book about a year ago. I just beacame more aware of water. There are no real practical tips such as when to drink water and how much. What to add in the water? I don't know what book to recommend but don't buy this one.Also in my experience drinking too much water can make you feel tired as all of your salts are flushed out of your system. I have found that sometimes drinking water right when you get up is helpful. Drink about a cup. Drinking water on hot sunny days will help up to a point. But if it's overdone you will feel tired.
2,Obvious information already common sense,Common sense information. Not anything that was particularly helpful to me. But it had a few valid points. I passed it on to a friend
2,Water,I think the good doctor could have condensed the book down to a few pages to get his basic premise across. The rest is fill where Dr Batmanghelidji acclaims himself against a hostile environment of non-acceptance of his ideas by other medical practitioners. He is to be congratulated in being courageous enough to go against the lucrative practice of other physicians who are better known for prescribing useless or harmful drugs to treat conditions which would respond to changes in lifestyle.I enjoyed the book but found myself skimming to find the the real meaningful information I was seeking.
5,all you ever need to be healthy,"Great book, style not so good but who cares? Information presented is priceless.I found answers and solutions here for my 4 years study to fight my health problems.Don't read idiots reviews who gave it one star, they're usually very bad doctors whohave no idea what health and helping people means. They went to medical schools to make money, nothing else.They envy that somebody actually can cure some illness without drugs.This book is a must read for anybody who cares about his/her body."
5,You are what you drink,"I had no idea the negative effects not drinking enough water had on one's body. My husband & I have started drinking our quota or more of water per day and the pain I was having, although minor, has pretty much gone away. I have also shared what I've learned to other people. One of the people I've shared with is planning to buy the book. It is very in depth and I don't understand it all, but I think I understand it enough to help me and others."
4,Who Knew ?,"This book was recommended reading to me by a relative. I purchased this book to enlighten our grandchildren of the holocaust since their grandfather and uncle were ""hidden children."" It is an extraordinary tale of escape that made it possible for generations to read and enjoy the Curious George books. Our family read so many of the Curious George books and now they are being read and enjoyed by the NEXT generation....Hopefully, they will continue to delight and teach for many years to come......."
3,Interesting book,"This is a children's book yet it is an adult topic. An interesting & helpful way to broach the subject of war, or more specifically, the Nazis, to your kids. I'd say it's for age 8 & up even though the writing style is definitely younger."
3,"Great western swing, poor western movie","This 1940 Monogram picture was the first opportunity for many fans to see Bob Wills who at that time was a national phenomenon, a true super star. Wills, along with brother Johnnie Lee, guitarist Eldon Shamblin, bassist Son Lansford, clarinetist Wayne Johnson, and steel guitar legend Leon McAuliffe no doubt thrilled their fans with renditions of ""Lone Star Rag"", ""Playboy Special"",and ""Gone Indian"". Plus they heard an upbeat ""Good Old Oklahoma"" (compared to the 78 rpm release) and a great version of ""You Are My Sunshine"" by Tex Ritter. The plot is typical B western, but seeing some of the greatest western swing musicians ever in their prime makes this movie a ""must have"" for fans of the genre. It has five star music and a one star plot. But forget the plot and enjoy some legendary music by legendary musicians."
3,Chisel roll,This is a fine tool pouch/roll unless you have some really nice chisels... Have had tools slip out and drop occasionally. But this is probably my own carelessness. Look for Barr chisels and tool roll if you're serious!
2,OK,For the price your better of to get the MIP CVDS for $8 more. These are the same as the stock and bend easily if you land the wrong way which causes a vibratrion a eventialy will kill your car.
1,Can't use,"I cannot give a proper review of this item, because Amazon decided it would be best to leave out important details, such as the fact that this isn't compatible with 3.5 mm or even 2.5 mm jacks. It plugs in with rj-11, the same as the actual phone receiver piece that you use on your desk phone. I have to send this back now, because this renders it useless in my situation."
2,Poor Quality Bike,"I previously owned a Gremlin, which was great. But this Ignition is truly an inferior bike. The hand brakes constantly have to be adjusted. The training wheels bend easily, and the tires do not have gripping power. Extremely frustrating to use."
2,"A Cool, Marketable Title is Wasted on an Undeserving Disappointment","HALLOW'S END is another sour pickle from the seemingly-bottomless barrel of straight-to-video seasonal stinkers. Although the well-worn premise is general enough that it might've gone in any number of gorehound-satisfying ways (college students prepare an annual charity Halloween spook house in an empty warehouse), all is squandered as the crudely-drawn characters wander here and there, tripping over every cliché they can find while avoiding any sort of satisfying payoff the audience so richly deserves. The pacing seems off, with nothing really horrific happening for eons, and when it does, it's sometimes so poorly-lit and badly-shot, the viewer must rely on character exposition to figure out what happened. HALLOW'S END shows nary a shred of artistry in the writing, directing, or acting; the best thing it has going for it is a cool, marketable title that is utterly wasted on an undeserving disappointment."
5,This Movie Rocks!,"This movie was awesome! We need more of Cloud v. Moore! What a combo. Who cares about Freddie v. Jason or Alien v. Predator, what would be awesome is Cloud v. Moore 2. I thought it was awesome that these two went at it so much, but I lost a big time bet because I thought that Cloud would've faught back and won. We rented this movie and found it to be a very fun movie. I can't wait for part two, I know a lot of you people are backing up cloud big time and I like Cloud, but Moore was good too. I think they should have a re-match. This movie is worth it to watch Stephen Cloud and Matt Moore."
1,this blows,"oh my god, does anyone else think that stephen cloud himself wrote all the reviews on this site... i mean did anyone watch the movie..it blewwww! personally, when i watch a movie, even a good one, i dont tell someone about the actors in it, i tell them about the plot. oh but i guess this would be hard to do for this movie because there IS NO PLOT! or if htere was a plot, i dont htink anyone could stand to watch to the movie long enough to find out what it is! once again,it BLOWS! this is by far the most boring movie i have ever watched..sorry to break it to ya if you did wroite those reviews, ahem steven!"
1,Just horrible,"i've watched low budget movies before but this was just simply terrible. you keep expecting it to get better but before that happens, it ends. Just awful, don't waste your time watchimg it. i'm the type that would watch just about any horror movie and enjoy 99 percent of it but this has got to be one of the worst if not The worst."
1,Not what I had hoped for...,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge horror fan, and my absolute favorites are the cheesy 80's flicks. That said, when I chose to watch a new (2003) horror movie, I never expected to see a film that was trying so hard to copy the ""cheesy 80's horror"" genre. Some things just cannot be copied and still maintain entertainment value. This film wasn't funny or exciting on any level, at least to me. The actors were dull, and the story was not developed well. The displays of nudity seemed to be placed in hopes of attracting hormonal teens. Oh, and there were no subtitles, which is a 'must' in our household. For people looking for a truely entertaining cheesy horror flick, I suggest ""Dolls"" and those looking for a good modern horror should keep looking. Just my opinion, as always."
2,"Stephen Cloud is great, the movie is not!","Yes I agree with a lot of you that Stephen Cloud is a great actor. He's obviously trained and tries his best to keep this film together, but the film is awful. There is not one good thing about it besides Cloud. The direction needs directing, the plot needs one, and the film flops. However, if there is one nice thing to say it's that Stephen Cloud, as the rest of you say was great for the times he was on the screen, but he didn't save this awful movie come on."
5,Talk about a bulls-eye...,"I cannot understand how the casting people hit thejackpot with Cloud and Matt Moore and I guess that guywho played Gary and missed on everyone else. Man, ifthey make a Hallow's End 2 I hope that Dan and Garycome back to life and take on Tom Sharp in a 3-waybattle. Is someone working on the script? StephenCloud did an admirable job in holding this filmtogether through the dry spells (i.e. non StephenCloud-acted scenes). He is very legit folks, enjoythis performance!!"
1,"The ""one-star"" is for the ""REVIEWS""","*Okay... so everybody's going ga-ga over this ""Stephen Cloud"" guy, whoever dahell he is.Okay... so everybody's jamming about how great a movie this is and how much it ""rocks.""Okay... so everybody and their house cat are ""recommending"" it.Okay... fine. Just one question:WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT THE HELL THE MOVIE IS ABOUT!!!!Accolades mean NOTHING if the ""rest of us"" have absolutely NO IDEA what the story is! Imagine if everyone dumped heaps of praise on the movie ""DEEP THROAT,"" then someone went into to it with the idea that it was probably going to be a movie about the Nixon/Watergate leak, because nobody bothered to mention anything about the film's plot or content. That's the situation we have here.So ""HALLOW'S END"" is a ""horror"" movie. Okay, but that's ""ALL"" the ""rest of us"" know about it until somebody breaks the pattern and tells ""the rest of us"" a little something about the movie itself other than ""Stevie Clod is soooooo HOT!"""
2,Dumb (Not Fun Dumb),"I watched this on PPV in the early morning hours. First off, it was barely watchable and boring. Secondly, the acting was shocking. But the film did have some good production values. Director Keeyes did a fine job with the low budget.Defining this movie as ""dumb"" doesn't do justice to all the dumb fun movies out there. ""House of the Dead"" for example. This movie just doesn't succeed on any level and the attempts at sexiness with a girl on girl scene are laughable!!! I truly regret watching this film and my life is poorer for it. There is 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back and $3.95 that I'll always be chasing.Sucks...."
1,Stephen Cloud sucks!!!!!!,"I have to admit, I dated someone that worked on this film. They were constantly telling me how much of a tool this Stephen Cloud was. They said he thought he was the best and that he couldn't prove it. So, since the movie was filmed, my boyfriend who worked on the film and I broke up. I watched this film the other day. Stephen Cloud has to be the worst actor in the world. Seriously, he made the film awful. Johnny Depp is pretty bad but I wouldn't even compare Stephen Cloud to Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp is better. Stephen Cloud is a joke. I would put money on the fact that Stephen Cloud is not going anywhere. Absolutely nowhere. Contact me if you want to bet."
4,buyer review 2011,The seller was excellent with shipping the item promptly. Item was just as described; I would recommend/ buy from again. Thank You
5,Sharon from Indiana,"This book came in a very short time and was delivered in the exact condition in which it was listed. The companion CD was intact and unopened and the code was good for the website. I wish I would have known earlier about this site, I would have saved tons on my books."
2,Not A Great Book !,"Book not in really good shape, I would've called it fair condition & it was listed as really good condition. I am not impressed with the book & it's really boring reading it. I thought this would be exciting to take the Earth Science class, but it's not."
1,Never arrived,After sending many emails to the seller because the product did not arrive (at all) I finally contacted Amazon. Shortly after that I got a message from the seller saying the product had been sold out. Would have been nice to know this sooner.
1,Null,"Terrible. I got charged for the book but never received it. Sent one email, got a reply. Next email went unanswered. Working on getting my money back now. Will look out for this name and not order from again."
3,Product Great...Distributor Poor,"I paid a premium for faster delivery. From the time the order was placed to the time It was delivered, was a week. If thats premium service then it's a joke. For as much as the shipping charges were I would have expected a much faster delivery. I actually did not have it when my class started which set me behind from day one."
1,way too easy compared to the real SAT CHEM subject test,"this book's practice tests are nothing like the real SAT... i bought this book to study with, did the practice tests, felt ready, and was utterly shocked when i took the SAT CHEM subject test yesterday. The real test is a lot harder than than this book's practice test. I was able to get 800's on the model tests in the back of the book, but when i took the SAT's, i wasn't even able to complete the whole test within the given hour...i would suggest finding another source to prepare with"
4,Thorough,"This is the one that offered full explanation to the questions. It means that they didn't only tell WHY A/B/C or D is true but also WHY the rest are not.The book is thoroughly written and easy to follow, in every chapter they offered multiple choices questions as well as CE ones. Kaplan's, Barron's did not have CE type questions. Kaplan's review practice quizz followed are even worse, they're not multipla choices at all!However this book is easy, and it may not guarantee a 800."
4,SAT Chemistry,"This book is thorough and detailed. You can go at your pace and go back over anything you don't understand, as many times as you like. It even has techniques to help you learn to associate concepts. I give this book 4 stars because it has really helped me so far, but there's always room for improvement."
3,Expensive But Worth It,These refills like all the stuff for the Xyron machines are expensive. They are well made though and insert without difficulty. My biggest problem is that they need a warning strip to let you know when you are at the end of the roll. I have ruined a lot of projects that way. I wrote to the company to suggest they find a way to do this and never got a response.
1,Pass this one by,"If you're looking for a quick way to learn authentic Korean, this is not the system for you. The syntax and grammar taught on this tape and book are outdated and impractical. The tape can be hard to follow, and the ""teaching"" process -- the speakers saying the phrase quickly, then having you repeat it in the second or two of blank space after the phrase -- is frustrating and makes it impossible to really learn anything. I am even learning Korean through classes, and I thought this tape would provide nice reinforcement or additional practice ... but I was wrong! Pass this one up."
2,"Technical, for experts","I read the author's very good ""Encyclopedia of the Sea"" and hoped this would be equally entertaining. It seems this book is more for people who already know a lot about ancient life. There are illustrations, but not enough as the author will describe bizarre, one of a kind creatures, but then not have a drawing of it. He describes contraversies about where a fossil belongs in the classification tree or if a new branch has to be added. I found the ""Shape of Life"" video much more interesting. This book seems to be a scholarly work, with many quotes and credits given, for other scholars."
3,Amazingly color-blind for the 1920s!,"It stunned me that a white man in the 20s could write such a book. In the heyday of the KKK, Madison Grant, social darwinism and immigration restriction and still somewhat in the era of imperialism, one would not expect to find such a modern view of race. Speer denies the racial superiority of any one group, believing all have integrity and a mission in G-d's plans. He opposes discrimination against numerous ethnic and racial groups and makes numerous calls for religion to unite peoples, rather than divide them. Heavily reliant on quotes from other authorities, both American and foreign, Speer shows an open mind and a forward-looking viewpoint. Not written especially well, but interesting for its message and its time."
3,Not Durable,"I bought this pair back in March and have used it about 10 times for 3 hour dance and lessons. I really like these shoes, however they are not durable. Recently I noticed that there was a 'gash' in my shoe where there was always a crease where I bend my toes (to tip toe); I knew nobody slashed my shoes and they have always been safely put in a bag so I can safely say that the man-made leather cracked. It's a nice stable beginner shoe with a good steady heel, however if you want something that will last you a little longer, I would definitely recommend buying actual ballroom dancing shoes for professionals that would actually be worth your time and money."
2,Dont bother,"I did not order this as a dance shoe, I ordered it as a casual shoe, because it had a 20s look. I figured that since it was a dance shoe, it should be comfortable and sturdy. That was not the case, I might as well be walking on banana peels, it has absolutely no traction at all.The soles are flimsy, and I had to wonder what the 30 dollars was paying for."
5,best dance shoe,i do alot of dancing and i recently injurd my ankle - i purchased this shoe and it is not only comfortable you feel as if you had nothing on its great on any dance floor you can dance all night and your feet will love you for choosing this shoe - i highly recommend this shoe to anyone who loves to dance - trust me your feet will appreciate you for them
5,Very comfortable shoes,"They are very comfortable dance shoes. The size chart is correct. Generally, the dance shoes tend to be smaller than usual sizes. These shoes match the size chart. Their size is similar to regular shoes. I emphasize the size issue as it is the biggest handicap for online shoe shopping. You cannot do wrong with these shoes. They are very good and comfortable. Enjoy the dance."
4,This helps out!,This book is great! It gives me all of the secret locations and hard to find jiggies. Some of the stuff is hard to understand though. Besdies thart i love it.
4,Nice Sturdy Sandal,"This is a comfortable walking slip-on sandal. It is not too heavy and great for water activities. Unfortunately, it was kind of tight, I would suggest to buy a size larger than your regular shoe size. I am hoping over time this sandal stretch for a better fit.."
2,"Good Story, Bad Book","Though meaning well, this book couldn't keep me wanting more. The story is riddled with poor grammar, minuscule chapters, and frequent mentioning of ""the sickness."" I swear, by the end of the second chapter, ""the sickness"" was mentioned so many times that ""the sickness"" lost all meaning to me, as she also tried to make ""the sickness"" sound overtly ominous. Whatever. And don't get me started on the somewhat open-ended finale. So how does she cope with her past and find a way to move on? Good question."
4,Intersting book.,"This is an interesting book dealing with the issues of incest and sexual, emotional and physical abuse told from the victim's point of view. It will open your eyes to a different sort of life that you may never imagined existed."
3,"Hank Williams, Jr","A combination of his personal life and music. Mostly personal life. Would have liked it better, if there was more music."
4,Good Ole Hank,"This DVD is decent. I wish there would have been more singing in the DVD. It tells alot about Hanks life that I didn't know and that's cool, but I feel like this is more of a documentary than a music DVD. It does have a few of his hits, but it rarely plays them all the way through. However, if you are a Hank fan, I would say it you should have it for your collection."
2,Not great.,"I bought this because consumer reports rated it #1 amongst their epoxies(2600 lbs/inch strength advertised)). I first used it on my lawnmower deck - failure, the bond didn't hold 48 hours. Next usage: A door handle(metal) on an APC server rack - failure, the bond lasted under 4 days. The next usage was to hold two hard drive magnets back to back - lots of gluing surface area. I glued together 6 of these: 4 are holding, 1 is untested, and 1 bond didn't hold for 48 hours. I gave the epoxy a 2 rating because of the hard drive magnets that did hold, although I don't really expect them to hold for long. I have since re-glued the door and the lawnmower deck - if they hold I will add an addendum to this review. If there is no addendum, you may assume the bonds did not last."
4,Anerge MP4 player,"Good player, compact, a lot of memory. Speakers are a plus. Comes with good earphones, USB, and newly wrapped. screen doesn't scratch. I recommend"
4,okey mp3/mp4,"I got this item about a month ago and all the features are working,it has good sounds for the price."
2,MP4 MP3,it isn't what I thought it was it won't save the time. nor does it hold as Music Music as I thought it would I can only place 30 songs on it my Nephews that is only 1 g holds 3x as much as this one does.the size and the Fact that it has General USB Cord is the only plus on it.I wouldn't buy it again
2,Overambitiously interesting,"Home tries to do a little too much here in attempting to satirize the contemporary London art scene within a what appears to be a parody of pulp fiction. The plot intertwines the trendies of the London art world with a gang of sympathetic, yet thuggish skinheads (the non-racist kind) let by Johnny Aggro. There's lots of silly art doubletalk, some asskicking of foolish people by the skins, and lots of sex. Not erotic or even pulp sex, but rather a parody of pulp sex. Everyone seems to want it--from frustrated social workers, to young schoolgirls, to the fat skinhead--and Home uses the same words to describe each act, sometimes duplicating the entire passage. In any event, Home's touch is far too heavy to pull this whole enterprise off."
5,"The Slow Death of ""Literary Fiction""","This novel should suck according to the standards of contemporary ""literary fiction"": there's no concern for the humanist pieties of psychological interiority, character development, epiphany; no concern for the realist shibboleths of verisimilitude and the matching of style to subject; no concern for the ""fine writing"" that will confer a spurious halo of distinction on high-end book consumers. And that's the point: the novel is brilliantly, strategically ""bad,"" in a way that calls out literary fiction as a total fraud. It's a parodic account of the Art World written in the crassest of pulp idioms, with hilariously formulaic fight and sex scenes in every chapter, and a free hand when it comes to gleefully plagiarizing other sources. And in passing it gives you the greatest playlist of Jamaican ska/rock steady/early reggae ever! So if you're thinking of reading the new Ian McEwan or Claire Messud do yourself a favor and get this instead."
2,cute but uncomfortable,"i regret purchasing this pair of heels.they're cute, but they're completely uncomfortable. they apparently run small and therefore pinch. what a disappointment."
1,Worst Album Ever,"I don't know who had the idea for this tribute, but they should be exiled from the music industry forever. Never in my life have I ever heard something so terrible. This album is not a tribute or salute. It is an insult to The Beatles and anyone who has ever heard these songs before. All I can say is, why? Why in the world would anyone make this album, much less listen to it. I am truly shocked and amazed that something as aweful as this could exist."
4,well worth the wait!,"I first heard about this album back in the 1990's but could not find it in any music stores in London, then earlier this year I was able to place an order with HMV Uk. However, they had to admit they could no longer supply. So, I tried Amazon.com and to my delight was able order a copy through them. It arrived, all the way from Texas and was certainly 'well worth the wait'. Excellent songs of course, but all given a bit of a twist. Very good performances - a really enjoyable record. Hard to pick out favourites, but I really liked Delbert McClintons take on 'Come Together' & Willie Nelson's 'One After 909'; also Kristofferson's track and Sammy Kershaw also. In short, a terrific cd, which I can recommed to anyone."
3,COUNTRY CROONING AND TWO STEPPERS,"John Berry's strong tenor is the saving grace of this early effort. Berry wrote and produced this collection of typical country fare. Most of the songs are the usual up-tempo or cry in your beer tunes that are fashioned to please conventional country fans. There are two memorable tracks: the catchy LONGING FOR HOME, with its California pop feel and the moving THINGS ARE NOT THE SAME which demonstrates Berry's sensitive vocal. Future releases would provide Berry the opportunity to showcase that talent."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"This comedy isn't the best... but for some reason I still love it.I can quite place my finger on it. Bronson Pinchot is a big part of it (in a character reminiscent of his role as Balki Bartokomous on ""Perfect Strangers""), but there is more to it than that.It really is a pleasant film, but it is also really silly.I think I would have given it 4 stars if it was more kid friendly.The humor lines up well for a family comedy, but there are too many sexual innuendos to really be comfortable watching it with small kids (it's kind of like Ghost Busters in that respect. You remember it as something you want to watch with your kids, but then it turns out it's got too many older themes to be a good kid movie)."
4,"""Not Bad 80's Comedy!""","John Larroquette and Bronson Pinchot star in this 1989 comedy.A detective, psychic and nun try to find a Cardinal and a womanwho have been kidnapped. This isn't bad, it has some cheesy/corny moments, but I've always enjoyed it. John and Bronsonare good in it and I've always liked Bronson as Balki on ""PerfectStrangers."" This dvd has good picture and sound, but only thetrailer. I recommend this."
4,Overlooked Gem,"This has always been one of my favorite comedies. Made when Bronson Pinchot and John Larroquette were both at the height of their careers, this movie was, as I recall, a flop at the box office. Ok, it's not exactly Shakespeare. But if you take it for what it is (a dumb comedy), you'll get a laugh out of this movie. I've waited for years for it to come out on DVD, and here it is. No extras or anything, just the movie. But it looks good and it laught good."
5,In Honor of Good Hearted People,I have been looking for this movie for quite some time. This movie is so funny and anyone who didn't enjoy it never wanted the Grinch to have a heart. To all of the people who like to laugh and have good feelings when you think about what made you laugh years later are automatically members of the Good Hearted People Society! Keep laughing - you'll live longer :)
1,Disappointing,"This is overpriced and pretty vapid stuff. Filled with amateurish llustations and stock advice. Nothing new here; there are scores of better golf guides out there, like Ben Hogan's and Harvey Penick's."
3,OK book,This is a good book with good information. I think there are better ones out there for the beginner though.
1,C Movie- Couldn't finish it,"Well, the storyline sounded interesting and it had some impressive stars but even these stars like Sean Young and Emmett Walsh seem to struggle with the story and script."
1,not worth buying,i thought the price meant it would be a good case for the phone. it wasnt. for 20 something bucks you would expect it to actually fit the phone. it covered the charge port. it just was a waste of money. returned the product. do not buy this item!
1,keep looking,"I have had to work with 2 ...They have short reeds so a great deal of metal is remove from each reed to get the tuning close on each note & close is often all you get. The reed plates thin and the plastic comb is weak, It bends [before breaking] much to easily, therefore the so a good air tight seal is not likely. Any entry level Hohner will be easier to play and last longer so will be a better bet for someone starting out."
5,Harmonica (blues),The quality of this harmonica is amazing. I recommend it to anyone interested in Harmonicas.
3,I fell for the cheap price,"What? This harmonica is plastic! It's not that great. I was brought into buying it by the cheap price (I love to get a good deal) but it's just what the price says, a cheap harmonica. Not worth it.I've always wanted a better harmonica than my current beginner 20-hole, so I wanted to change to a 10-hole. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this, I should have known better. But I've just put this one aside and continued practicing on my old one.Three stars were given just because it's for 2 bucks. It does what it's supposed to do, which is make noise, But if you want something with a good tone and really good feel(this harmonica is way short, barely bigger than your index finger) than I suggest going for a more expensive harmonica. It really is worth it in order to get a good sound."
2,the price says it all,"you get what you pay for with this model; contrary to what someone else said- it is NOT easy to play; you really have to blow into it; a few of the really high and low notes are poor compared to better quality harps; perhaps if it is just for a practice harmonica, the low price wont hurt,but, then again, you might want to practice on a harp with a better sound"
3,ok for beginners,"I order this because I wanted to learn to play. I wasn't epecting much from a two dollar harmonica, but I was to cheap to buy a nice one if I wasn't sure I was going to be able to learn to play it. I was suprised at how well it worked,I was to play anything I wanted in a week. After three week the middle brace fell down on both sides so I order the same one (again trying to save money)I used it in the state fair youth harmonica contest and came out with the blue ribbon. I have been playing for 18 month, and in my penny pinching way have re-order this harmonica four time, I recived a much nicer honer from a friend and it works so much better. so guess if you've never played a nice one then you won't know the difference but if your playing pro then you'll want a much nicer one!"
1,This is nutz...,"...Not only is that price for a mere 30 songs, but for 30 OLD songs that you could probably hear at any given moment on any Classic Rock radio station. Go buy Time Life's ""Guitar Rock #14"" or something if you want to hear this old, played out garbage.I'm a Harley lover, but this is cheesey."
4,Do you rememeber Gaunt's last order ...,"The beginning of this book is absolutely amazing, following their extended stay on a Chaos infested planet, ""Gaunts' insertion team"" comes back to find their regiment renamed. The trials that the team must face in the beginning of the book is an interesting twist to hailing the heroes. After the first hundred or so pages and the team is reinserted into the new regiment, the book goes slightly south with random interludes of Gaunt running around being a Commissar/Detective, solving battlefield mysteries. The description of the new characters is also weak, after a while, you basically realize if a semi-major new character isn't described very well he's probably gonna die. The book takes a upward turn when the scout team stumbles upon a warp portal which leads to the final epic battle. It finishes strong with Abnett's solid battlefield depictions. All in all a great addition to the Gaunt series and a must read for any Abnett or Ghost fan."
1,This article makes a false claim,"I am the Boyce Rensberger to which Andre Carothers refers in this article, and I can assure everyone that his claim about me is totally false. He says that wrote in The Washington Post in 1993 that ozone depletion was not happening. I did no such thing. Not even close, as a matter of fact."
4,"Great show, disks are not real user friendly","I'd give 5 stars to the shows themselves. Most of these are public domain and available on You Tube. However, it's nice to have them on a disk, available at a fair price. Navigation of episodes is difficult, no titles for the episodes - just numbers. It can be difficult to keep track of where you are.There is a 1 disk collection, 13 episodes, by Echo Bridge. I'm fairly certain all those episodes are also on this 2 disk collection."
3,Not bad,"It's not a bad compilation of You Bet Your Life. The video is low-res, but that is to be expected. I think the only important thing missing are English subtitles; I'm not a native English speaker and sometimes the gags fly around too quick for me to follow. At the bottom line, it's a cheap compilation, in both good and bad senses."
2,"over exposed,poor quality,no detail,same as Jack Benny dvd purchased","poor quality,no detail,waste of money.Am 91,do not know how to return for credit,I suppose its a pity I cannot as it woulp to pay for my current order of Les mis i have on order"
5,CLASSIC GROUCHO,"If you love to laugh, if you want to watch one of the sharpist minds ever recored please buy this video."
1,Avoid this game...,"...unless you enjoy games with unclear rules and goals. There are ""Mission"" cards and ""Action"" cards. Half of these cards are confusing or contradictory to an already confusing set of game rules. A lot of the other cards are entirely pointless.If you enjoy spending as much time trying to understand how a game is played as you do actually playing the game, then you might enjoy this. However, if you are looking for a game to play with your family where you can pretty much open the box and start playing, do not buy this game unless you see it in a bargain bin."
4,UFO - 'BBC Radio 1 Live' (Griffin),"First four tracks here come from a 1974 concert, where the superb twin guitar sound of Michael Schenker and Paul Chapman more than sizzles. The rest of the disc was pulled from a later gig. This is one band I've never gotten to see play live. Maybe there's still hope.Heard they still tour with three (is it?) original / classic line-up members. A fan can't ask for too much more than that. Cuts that make this CD a true keeper are ""No Place To Run"", ""Only You Can Rock Me"", ""Lights Out"", the ass-kicking ""Rock Bottom"", ""Doctor Doctor"" and ""Shoot Shoot"". A good classic hard rock title to have."
5,Just Beautiful,"They are just BEAUTIFUL!!! More than I expected, they are going to look amazing on my wedding tables!! So Happy"
5,beautiful,Love the work.and the price was perfect for the amout of napkins I receive.the napkins arrived before the due date
4,Very nice work!,I had napkins made in honor of a friend's new book and the wide selection meant I was able to closely mimic the font and the colors of the actual book cover with the cocktail napkins. Very nice!
4,"duality, checks and balances, invert-revert, Jerry Springer","Significant events since this book was written (1981) make this nary the publication for activist or critical involvement 19 years later, but this book breaks down into neat little packets, the nomenclature of those tides: the ones that rise and the ones that recede. It's how not to institute what is valued and yet maintain the institution. So I guess since this book provides no forecasting (except a heavy chapter on the nuclear age and a World War III) other than to say let's be reminded of our history.... The complexities outlined with nearly no bias are a helpful guidebook still today since the debates will rage and no body of people will be happy for a satisfactorily allotted duration."
5,Food Addiction is not about Good or Bad,"I had a doctor who first spoke to me about a possible eating disorder, and I thought he was nuts. But the more we talked and he supported me I came to understand what he was saying. This book is a wonderful resource for people that can not understand their uncontrollable eating. It gives practical exercises for self discovery. Food addiction is not about dieting and often diets may trigger the addiction for compulsive eating. It took me to learn this before I could address my weight issues."
3,Very psycho educational book,I find this book very useful in understanding binge eating disorder. I think its very user - reader friendly and use is very often in therapy.
2,Complicated boring self help,"Too complicated and boring for someone suffering from an eating disorder to comprehend. Keep it simple. If you identify compulsive eating behaviors and stop them, your life gets simple. Eat less exercise more."
5,She is right on,"I bought and read this book while in treatment for a food addiction. Her information was so on target with my experience that I bought copies to loan to friends and family as well after I discovered how well she explained what I was going through, so that they could have a better sense of what I experience. Her chapter for loved ones is right on target and her plan for gradually abstaining from sugar, then carbs then fats makes good sense. Makes it do-able without making it feel like one more diet to try. It is a permenant lifestyle change and it takes support."
4,keystone mafia?,this is a very funny movie with a lot of action. original book written by jimmy breslin; this is the mafia as never seen before. very early robert deniro in a comedy role. hilarious. must see!
2,The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight,"A lot of great talent but, Takes too long to get to the point. -- Don't bother"
3,early Robert DeNiro,"There are only two reasons to see this film: 1) Robert DeNiro, playing a Sicilian immigrant con artist, 2) Jerry Orbach playing an inept Brooklyn Italian Mafiosi ...both at the start of their long illustrious careers, which makes this film a classic, and why I bought the DVD."
2,"Not funny, not a mob movie,","This movie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be and ended up being nothing. Not knowing what to expect I thought I'd either get a mob movie about the Gallos, or a parody of mob mivies, I got neither. The jokes just don't work and there is no substance beyond the jokes."
5,National Geographic Classic,"Antone interested in Meso-American civilization will enjoy this delightful book. A National Geographic Society book that informs in magnificent color photographs, over 150 in all and specially commisioned paintings. The text is not overly scholarly and is easy to read by the layman or amateaur anthropologist. The text covers the Olmecs and culminates with the Maya's history through modern times. The commisioned painting are truly works of art and they bring the Maya to life. Great stuff for anyone intersted in one of the least understood pre-columbian groups, the Maya."
3,Whew......,"The ghost writer botched a decent history by trying to combine separate venues; i.e., history and story telling. Tried to immitate what was thought to be a Marine in combat - missed the mark - if you are interested in an intelligent first hand narrative of a Marine under fire read Eugene Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"" - you'll never forget that one."
5,amazing true story,"As a former marine (1969-1973) and having served in Viet Nam, although not as a grunt, I thought this was a great book. Amazing story of what the Marine Corps is about. Some say a little slow at the beginning, but I was hooked from beginning to end."
4,Hill 488,"Hill 488 is the story of one of the many hill actions that took place in Vietnam. Where as the Marine Recon Patrol had no intentions of making a stand on Hill 488,they were unprepared for what was about to transpire. The book was well written by those with first hand experiences on the Hill.An almost unbelievable story of courage and Honor.This is what makes the USMC the greatest fighting force in the world.In the face of overwhelming odds victory was achieved at a great cost."
5,Great read,I originally read this book because a man I worked with was in therelief group and is mentioned by name in the book several times. I thought the book started out kind of slowly but it's worth the read.
3,Semper Fi,"This book tells an incredible story about the desperate fight one recon platoon had on the night of June 15/16th in 1966. Unfortunately, the fight for Hill 488 doesn't start until 2/3rds of the way through the book. Also there were a number of pages filled with information that could have been left out like having a full bio of each guy in the middle of the book. This introduction of the men of first platoon would have been better placed in an appendix. Also the phrase ""It don't mean a thing."" was not invogue in 1966. During this early period of the war, the American soldier still believed in what he was doing in Vietnam and apathy had not yet begun to infect the rank and file. What is a picture of Khe Sanh doing on the front cover? I've read better written books about grunts in Vietnam but thankful that Ray told the story of that one epic night on Hill 488."
2,King of obscure proofs,"I've never been a big fan of Apostol. He tends to make things more difficult than they really are. Some of the reviewers commented that they are impressed with the elegance of the proofs, which makes me wonder if they are as confused as Apostol. As an example let's consider his proof of the FTC. There is an easy and elegant proof which you find in most books, but Apostol tries to be cute and gives an obscure and ugly proof. Mathematics is an art, and Mr. Apostol is no Picasso."
4,Around and Around!!!!!!!!!!!,"With the first track, I was sure this was going to be a great album. Around and Around is so fun, rockin, and happy. And with the up coming songs, I was feeling The Stones. Especially when I got to Time Is On My Side and then the outstanding Its All Over NOw. Unlike most people, I didn't just get the cd to replace my record, I'm a new Stones fan. And I must say I like 1960's/Brian Jones Stones. With that said, side two, is a little worse. By Susie Q, I wasn't feeling them, but this was a good album!!!!!!!!"
4,Early Stones album with improved sound,"The Stones second U.S. album, 12x5, was filled with some great covers and some early original material. Besides being one of their best early albums, the sound has been improved greatly. The album now contains STEREO versions of songs that have never been heard, let alone released, in the U.S. before. This version is superior to the old ABKCO version. This is definitely one album worth buying in the current SACD collection. You will not be disappointed in the upgraded sound. Highly recommended."
2,Sophomore Slump,"Every great musical act has had a miss and 12x5 is a really bad miss. This album continues the Stones path of R&B, and Blues infused rock covers, but unforutnately unlike that album this album had few songs to like about it. Around and Around is a thumping good intro for the album and a disappointing one in some ways, it is easily by far the best song on the album followed by Susie Q and the instrumental track 2120 South Michigan Avenue. The rest of the tracks of so so with the worst among them their take of Time is On Your Side and Under the Boardwalk (never again should they attempt to do R&B harmonies)."
3,"Solid follow up, but...","...not nearly as good as the debut or the following album. But there are some gems, like Around and Around, Confessin' the Blues, Time Is on My Side, Good Times Bad Times and It's All over Now. But there's too much filler in the second half, like Under the Boardwalk, Grown up Wrong, If You Need Me and Susie-Q, as well as Empty Heart from early on. For the hardcore Rolling Stone fan only."
3,A GOOD ONE,"THIS DISC IS BETTER THEN SOME OF THIER BETTER KNOWN TITLES,CONTAINING ROUND AND ROUND,TIME IS ON MY SIDE(WITH A ORGAN INTRO) UNDER THE BOARDWALK,AND MY OWN FAVORITE FROM THIS ERA,IT'S ALL OVER NOW! RECOMENDED!"
4,Once again they hit the mark,"12 x 5 is the second album the ROLLING STONES released back in the early 60's. Once again we are treated to their interpretations of some classic rock and blues songs, mixed in with a few originals. The band is showing off their blues influences on this one and they pull it off well. The songs on this album that deserve a listen to are: AROUND AND AROUND, CONFESSIN' THE BLUES, EMPTY HEART, TIME IS ON MY SIDE, GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES, IT'S ALL OVER NOW. These songs are the standouts on this album. After this, I think the album loses some steam, but not all that much. I think on UNDER THE BOARDWALK, the band seems alittle out of place, I alson think this is true on SUSIE Q. Those two songs aside, I think that this is good album and shows off the early STONES in fine form."
2,Equals less than you'd think,"'Hey guys! Let's build an album around our new hit single, throw in the contents of a British EP (5x5, funnily enough), and pad out the rest with some half-baked covers!' This one's just alright. The songs from the EP are excellent, and the mix of R&B/Chuck Berry rock is fine enough, but it just doesn't add up to anything more than a dozen tracks selected pretty much at random. High point: It's All Over Now, of course."
5,The Stones Do Chess,"12x5 is the first great Rolling Stones record. Their first two releases showed the band's potential, but they realized it on this manic collection that finds them perfecting the Chess Records, Chicago R&B sound that so heavily influenced. From the opening riff of their ripping version of Chuck Berry's ""Around & Around"" to their magnificent version of ""Susie Q"", the band is on top of their game. Their versions of ""Time Is On My Side"", originally done by the great Irma Thomas, and Bobby Womack's ""It's All Over Now"" have become Stones classics, while lesser known tracks like ""Empty Heart"", which has some ripping guitar riffs, ""Confessin' The Blues"" and ""Good Times, Bad Times"" stand right up next to them. The band pays tribute to Chess Records with the instrumental ""2120 South Michigan Avenue"". 12x5 solidified the foundation for their now almost 40 year career."
3,Blue Stones,"The Stones were probably the best white band in the 60's to play rock n roll/blues and this is quite an example. They could play it with authority, not really trying to copy, but taking those songs and turning them into rolling stones songs, that somehow matched what they were all about: a bunch of ragged and dangerous guys with guitars. Even their ballads sound obscure and not polished. This Cd has some unforgettable tracks, like under the boardwalk, susie q, good times, ect. Probably just a couple of songs do sound like fillers, but this was just their second album."
3,Before the HITS:,"I was just filling in the holes in my ""Stones"" catalog! For the most part this disc is pretty weak! It was recorded at a time before ""The Glimmer Twins"" started writing good songs (or bad songs for that matter) Good covers of ""Chuck Berry's ""Around & Around"", Bobby Womack's ""It's All Over Now"", and the always popular ""Time Is On My Side"" make the disc worth owning."
5,Great Early Stones!,"The Rolling Stones always tended more toward the bluesy side, as opposed to The Beatles. While The Beatles sang of Good Day Sunshine, The Stones were Confessing The Blues. This, along with all their sixties albums, show the true core of The Rolling Stones's sound. A must have."
2,Who Do We Think We Are defeats12 X 5!,"12 x 5 is the Rolling Stones 2nd album, released back in late `64. You get their interpretation of bluesy and rock classics, plus a few originals. Now this was never my favorite Stones album, but I had to get it so I could complete my collection that goes up till ""Sticky Fingers"". I never could get into ""Exile on Main Street"" or anything after that.The songs from 12 x 5 that still hold up in my opinion are: Around & Around, Confessin` The Blues, Time Is On My Side, Good Times, Bad Times, It`s All Over Now.After this, I think the album totally falls apart.But lately, I've been listening to Deep Purple's 1973 album ""Who Do We Think We Are""and perhaps that's just not fair to the Stones'12 x 5 album. For the hard core Stones fan only."
5,best of early albums,"i bought this album when it first came out (1965?). bought it on cd recently and was reminded how good it was/is. in fact, my friends and i used to consider the stones' first 5 albums a sort of ""Old Testament""of 60's british invasion r&b. check out ""confessin the blues"" and ""its all over now"" in particular."
4,A great early Stones album,"12 into 5 is one of the finest early albums from the Stones which reveals their early bluesy roots.This classic contains such masterpieces like Around and around,Confessin the blues time is on my side.All the songs are good and this cd is highly recommended."
3,Lost a sale,"The Airlay company also makes a Twin XL size. I need the extra length! I had to go elsewhere. Too bad. No sale.I don't have an option to NOT rate the product, so ignore my rating."
3,Definitely worth reading,"This is a self-published tome, and as such, it isn't perfect. There are points where the prose could use a little bit of polish, and the jumping back and forth in time can get a little confusing. But honestly, if Jeanine Renne can write something this gripping without an editor, I'd really love to see what she can do with one. I wasn't involved in the events discussed in this book at all and in fact have nothing to do with Lord of the Rings fandom, but this story has fascinated me ever since I first heard about it last December, and it's great to finally get the full scoop in one place. One of the best parts is the ""appendices,"" which include transcripts of an Internet chat in which supposed ""hobbit channeling"" took place, and Amy Player's final ""suicide note"" to her parents. Anyone who's interested in pathological liars, what makes them tick, and how they succeed in making people believe them is going to want to read this book."
5,Hurrah for Tenacity and Truth!,"Although the venue of this true story is ""Lord of the Rings"" fandom, the book is bootcamp for ALL trusting, good-willed folk--no matter WHAT your passion--in how con-artists beguile. Indeed, it tells exactly how, and how FAR, two con-artists actually went to get what they wanted, everybody else be damned. Fake gender? Fake suicide note? Fake charity? Multiple fake pasts? NO PROBLEM! Let's hope, as I believe, that author Jeanine Renne's first-hand experience will make a fake *future* seriously difficult for two depraved narcissists still on the loose--and oh-so-eager to con YOU! This book is a fascinating read, and a valuable expose. Buy it before YOU get snookered!"
2,Grinding axes in public,"It seems reasonably accurate, if somewhat self-serving. She does give a fair amount of space for evidence and other people's opinions. But honestly, I don't think it's a particularly good use of trees."
1,"Interesting Topic, but Wrong Writer","This is admittedly a fascinating topic--two fans of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movie who managed to bilk other fans out of thousands of dollars, while spinning an unbelievable tale that one of them was Elijah Wood's cousin with a hormone imbalance on the run from the IRA.The problem with the book? The author is one of the ""other fans"" who gave said ""Elijah Wood's cousin"" thousands of dollars. And she genuinely thinks that had you known the two swindlers, you would have given them thousands of dollars too. If you think that statement describes you, and can handle extremely amateurish prose, you'll probably like it. If you think some objectivity, particularly when it comes to something that the average reader will have an extremely tough time relating to, is useful--this one's not for you."
4,Adventure Inlay - What I kike and dont like,"The game is entertaining and relaxing at first, then the timer starts and you don't receive the pieces you need before the timer runs out and you start over. The game is challenging at the higher levels but would be better with a controlable time factor. The enjoyment is shapes and relaxing and if you like pressure and stress. I would prefer more user controlled gaming options. Still an enjoyable game."
5,Seasoned or Newbie,"This book is dead on and very informative, no matter if you've been at for years or just starting out. It's not only a ""how to"" but a very good ""why is that?"" type of read. You learn how to do what you need to do with your music and why it is done certain ways. So if you need to sharpen up the skills or pickup some to start with this is a good choice."
5,Ignore David Moran's comments...,"Mr. Moran, I don't usually take the time to write reviews but in this case I have to repond to your ridiculous and completely inaccurate comments in your 3-star review. Digital audio is NOT continuous, never has been and positively never will be. It simply is NOT possible to perfectly reproduce a continous analog sound wave with a rapid series of ones and zeros -- which is what digital audio (or digital anything, for that matter) is. With digital you can get close enough to fool the non-discerning listener. 96khz and beyond is an awful lot of samples per second; but no matter how you finely you slice it, they're still discrete samples and are in no way, shape or form continuous."
3,anyone who can write this is not to be trusted,"I have not read the book in full, but have heard the author wrote ""Analog recordings are technically more accurate than digital recordings, because analog recordings capture continuous waveforms, whereas digital recordings only capture discrete samples of the waveform.""This could not be more wrong, and, although a common and pernicious fallacy, shows the most profound misunderstanding of digital recording (which IS continuous) and analog recording.The problem is, if this guy (associated with Berklee!) can write ignorant stuff like that, he's capable of writing other misleading bunk about pro and semi-pro audio. And probably to be paid attention to only very carefully, indeed suspiciously."
2,Math only,"I taught myself linear algebra so my experience may have been worse than most but I thought this book was a pain. Forget about learning the easy concepts easily, this book throws you into math without clear explanations. The excercises were good but answers would've been nice. NOT an easy reference and definitely not a book to self-teach with."
2,Ok Linear Algebra Book,"This book is a classic but the subject is better treated elsewhere. The book will get the job done and has some good exercises, but if you're like me, you'll get fed up with the goofy notation and endless rambling examples. It's easy to get lost in all the rambling and lose focus on what's important."
4,Aussie Book Club Notes,"Norah and Barbara have done well to collaborate their talents together.The plot and storyline certainly had an air of credibility. The coming together of two cultures was a twist enjoyed by most. We found the vocabulary and grammar of the book written in an easy style with some interesting characters. Rachel and daughter Tess, having similar experiences throughout the book, showed us that an invisible bond occurs between mothers and children.Everyone enjoyed reading the book and we would like to congratulate Norah and Barbara on this endeavour and hope they continue on their journey with as much hope as we saw Rachel and Tess portrayed.This book had me turning page after page. The characters are three dimensional, wanting you to know what happens next. A great story and a great read! Well done."
5,perfectly imperfect heroine for a change!,This story is focused on a woman who is not physically perfect and I found it to be a refreshing change from the perfect models depicted in most romance novels. Theirs is a tender love story - you'll love it.
5,"This ""toy"" saved me $750","Like the other reviewers mentioned, I lost a valuable earring in my garden, and had given up hope of finding it when someone loaned me this ""toy"" metal detector. It still took hours, but I found my earring using this thing and I think that is amazing. There was no way I would have ever found it without this metal detector. It's a great toy, but it's also a useful tool, and recommend it to everyone I know."
4,A Needle in Toe,"A few days after Christmas my daughter's grandpa called me. He knew my daughter had gotten this toy metal detector for Christmas and wanted to know if I could bring down to his doctor's office. It was after hours and a patient thought she might have a needle in her foot. She was walking on her carpet when she felt a stabbing pain, but looked at her foot and didn't see anything sticking out of it. She did find a half a needle in her carpet. Grandpa didn't want to cut into the foot if there wasn't really a needle in it. I brought him the metal detector, and sure enough, it beeped when we ran it over the spot on her toe where she thought it might be. Who would've guessed this little toy would've found a needle in a toe!"
3,A bit disappointed,"I have to say, I am a bit disappointed... maybe we rec'd a bad one, but after reading all the reviews I was really excited about giving this to my daughter so we could go hunt on the beach. This machine barely detects something right on the surface. We change the sensitivity, but the range at which this detector can detect is very limited and very small."
4,Great toy for a six-year-old but charged too much,"My six-year-old loves it. It works well and does what it claims to do. However, I was dissappointed to see a clearance tag on a box, which showed this item only costing 14.99 and I paid a lot more!!"
3,Please help!!!!,"This metal detector has a constant beeping sound that does not go away until I turn it off. How can I turn this off??? I tried to let it beep for a couple of minutes to see if it goes away and... nothing, (away from metal of couse) any help will be apreciated."
2,Good except breaks easily,"I gave this to my son for Christmas. He wanted to put a review on Amazon. These are his words: ""It was a good present but two days after Christmas, the little wheel you use to turn on the detector kind of broke and fell inside the detector so I couldn't turn it off. And so I wouldn't highly recommend this because I don't think it's that well built."""
2,Sweet Taste,"I was looking for a more nutty taste. This coffee tends to be a sweet taste that was almost revolting to me, but if you like sweet, then it had a good flavor, just not the nutty flavor I was after.Bev"
5,Fantastic CD and a great intro to Ian Thomas's music,"Heavy Metal / Hard Rock? I think Amazon was listenting to something else when they wrote that out. This CD is a collection of jazzy bass riffs, lyrics that cut through the clutter and minimalistic drums. I don't think brushes on a snare count as heavy metal drumming. Ian Thomas had a prolific career as a Canadian solo artist and for some reason never broke big-time south of the 49th. This CD is the first of the Boomers CD's and it establishes a mood that he and his bandmates carry on for 4 (at time of writing) more CD's. Ian's song writing shines with his typical wit and humour. If you're going to buy this CD, you might as well buy all the Boomers collection. After listening to this one, you'll develop an appetite for more.. and more..."
2,"Paid for new received used,","I ordered this book mainly to bring my order over $25. I paid for a new book but received a used one. Customer service kindly refunded the charge. I was pleased with their prompt response. The book itself is not as cute as I expected based on description,"
4,great for kids,"This movie is like the Mexican equivalent of The Sandlot. My junior high Spanish students loved it. The movie is predictable and goofy, but perfect for getting kids interested in soccer and Mexican culture. Unfortunately, the movie is like a really long Coke commercial, and the translating was done poorly."
5,Perfect Fit,"I bought this for my sister, and it was a great looking shirt. The fit was excellent and the team logo was good quality. She wore it to a game we recently attended, and we did not see another shirt like it, so she also liked the ""uniqueness"" of the item."
1,Two dead headsets in six months (updated!),"This is a comfortable headset and it sounds great for voice chat, but I've gone through two of them in the last six months. The first, purchased about five months ago, lost sound on the right side about two months ago. The second, which was purchased immediately afterwards, lost sound on the left side less than an hour ago.Were it not for the repeated failures, this headset would get four stars from me.UPDATE: It's been about eight months since I wrote this review, and the replacement I received from Amazon for the second dead headset has now lost sound on its right side. Stay away from this headset!"
1,These Stink!!!,"I am on my second time around with these headsets. The first set I lost sound in my left ear, and because I loved the comfort and sound quality (I thought it may have been a fluke)I bought another set. BIG MISTAKE!! They also lasted less than a year, and I lost sound in the right ear. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
3,good for the price,"this is a good headset for the price, however it has a few negatives.the overall weight of the headset is a little much ... if i were to tilt my head forward or backward it could easily begin to slide off.the microphone quality is only as good as those other cheap computer mics you can get at wal-mart ... but what do you expect?the sound quality is middling - not very bassy, but it could have something to do with the thick earpads which put lots of space between your ear and the speaker.the headset is very comfortable though. the lower top bar going over the head is made of rubber (more comfortable than plastic) and not permanently attached to the sides, so it can come off, which is annoying. i haven't figured out why someone would want to take it off.The mic boom is extendable and bendable, which is nice. It can also rotate upward while not in use."
5,"I've had mine for 6 years, still going strong.","I purchased these specifically for playing MMO games online with my friends. So far they have ""just worked"" with both windows XP/Vista and my Mac OSX machines. The sound quality is decent for games and general voice communication. Sound effects are good and crisp, bass sounds bassy (but not incredibly so) and I've had them on my head for spans as long as four hours and didn't suffer any listening fatigue or discomfort. Light and soft without being flimsy. I even listen to music on occasion, but they aren't exactly a $400 pair of Sennheisers, but they don't claim to be either. The volume control/mute switch on the cable is nice and works well.Everything just works, and is still working. I'd definitely buy another pair if these died at this point."
4,Not bad for the price,"I have owned many Plantronic headsets and I would have to say for the price, this ones keeps up with the best of them that are more expensive. The sound is great and is just enough for the hardcore gamer that likes a little base and clarity in games."
2,Save yourself and pass on this model.,"The cheap price is the get what you pay for deal. I had a pair of these when they originally came out, and they lasted awhile but the cords have very thin insulation and that tore and broke the wire rendering them useless. A year later I bought another pair from amazon and the audio quality was terrible, not sure if they sounded like that the first time around. I had them a month and the cord got a cut in it again so in the trash they went. I tried to repair them the first time it happened but had no luck. This is also my 4th plantronics headset. The other two laster longer but the same thing happened to the cord. The first set was $110 and the the clip for the volume and mic controls actually broke the wires. So now i tend to stay away from plantronics. YMMV"
5,"Good price, good quality, and comfortable.","This is the second set we own. First set had the wires sucked up by the vacuum and stopped working. They are comfortable with good sound, and we haven't had any other problems with them. We have a mac which requires USB, so we found a USB hub that converted it over to USB. After we got the second set, I took the first set apart and the wires broke free of the little circuit board in the volume control, so I soldered those back on and it's working again. We use them for an online class and a little gaming. I would buy these again, and I think they are the best headphones you can get for $20."
1,Short-lived,"The mic died after about a year and a half of use. The quality is nice while it lasts, but you would be better off spending the extra money on something that works longer than a year. I'm surprised at the number of reviews on here from people who have bought this thing repeatedly..."
1,GamePro 1 from Plantronics,"Poor workmanship! They work great but I've yet to get the full year warranty offered by Plantronics. The wires must be very thin as they break very easily causing the loss of the earphone, microphone or both. I'll look for a alternative next time!"
1,Cheapo!!!,"I'm thinking of sending this junk back. I will if I can't figure a way to keep them on my head. The tension bar across the head, isn't strong enough to apply any pressure to hold them to your head. If you move your head fast, they will almost fall off. I will buy no more of this brand."
5,Easy to Find Online,I couldn't find this replacement spool at some major Hardware Stores. Actually found it at Amazon and ordered four of them (that made the order have free shipping). Doubt if I will ever need any more but now I know where to go!
3,Postage Due,"The product is fine.One problem!Even though postage was paid at the time of purchase, the package arrived US Mail with postage due. I don't recall how much but the fact that I had to make a trip to the post office to pay postage was annoying."
2,Replacement trimmer spool,"I ordered six of these spools the price was good and the first one so far was a disappointment. The thread for some reason was fused together throughout the spool. I had to unwind the entire spool using a utility knife to break away the fused portions. If the price is too good to be true beware. I am afraid to try the next 5. I bought others previously on amazon with no problems, paid full price. These work but you have to put in some work to get them to work."
3,works but not perfect,"It works, but somehow making more noise, shaking and heat on the motor. My guess is that itself is not well-balanced, but I'm not sure about it. It still does its job though, just not so well as the last one i used."
2,Buy some spares...,"You'll need a few spare spools because you'll go through the line quickly. I've found that if I hit anything that isn't grass - rocks, sprinkler heads, plastic edging - the line will break and you'll have to ""bump"" out a few more inches."
2,Does not last,I still had to hire a lawn service. I hae never used it since. I am tired of 5 more words
4,as expected,The spool is sturdy and has a good amount of string. The spool didn't crack during use or come loose. The string worked as expected and didn't break off or fray more than it should.
5,Black and Decker RS-136 Trimmer Spool,"This replacement spool is GREAT. The bump-feed is cool,but eventually you will wear out the spool and need a 'NEW' one. These are just the thing to put you back out in the yard sweating....and the neighbors wives will have to keep up, so the whole neighborhood will benefit from your work. WOW,and I just thought it was a trimmer spool...it's actually a Community Beautification Accessory.Better get TWO."
4,easier than stringing it.,"We have theBlack & Decker ST1000 9-Inch 1.8 amp Electric Grass Trimmerand these replacement spools are easy to pop out/in when needed. Haven't had any problem w/jams or twists, as I suspect we'd have if we stringed it ourselves. One star short for the price...shipping isn't free, it's in the price of the spool!"
3,B&D String,"We bought this product because we needed a spool replacement for our weed whacker. Unfortunately, when this string breaks, it breaks inside the spool so you need to open the whole thing up to pull the string to the outside. That gets really old to have to take it apart every time the string breaks."
3,String spool...,"These spools are basically good for only a year or so of use, then the string doesn't come out anymore. They are way overpriced for what it is, but B&D has the monopoly on this part. I restring myself until the spool itself wears out."
5,Great replacement part,"Bought this for the st4500 model trimmer that has been very used. Didn't need the line that was pre-wrapped on the unit, but it was a nice addition - and wrapped smartly with easy to remove tape. Very easy to put on and worked great today when tested out.Note: did not include the spring that goes on the inside - so save your spring even if your spool gets ruined."
4,Easy change string trimmer,I love my new easy to use light weight electric trimmer. Having easy to change string just makes that a much better product. Terrific and not too expensive I would suggest everyone purchase this product to make life easier than rewinding string by hand.
2,"Love the trimmer, hate the spool",The spool is way over priced at any Web site that I checked. It runs out of string really fast (I had to change it 3 times while trimming around my small .11 acre lawn). I finally found the correct size string so I can replace it in the spool without having to buy a whole new spool. I will see how that goes.
5,Great price!,"We had ordered the Black & Decker electric trimmer off of Amazon, and when it came time to order a refill spool I came straight back. It was a great price, it worked beautifully (I'm always worried that refills won't work quite the same), and I am very happy with the purchase."
1,less string for the money than last year,"it's mid-june and i've burned through the same amount of string i used last year. except last year, it was october. last year I bought all B&D bump feed trimmer string from amazon. this year 1 pkg i used was from amazon, and the rest through my local lowe's. i'm buying 1 last one from amazon to compare spool centers to determine who is ripping me off. as one reviewer already pointed out, it's possible the spool centers are larger. however, i also think B & D is providing less string."
4,A Lot of Fun,"Poor old bitter Mean Streak, still unable to spell, still bitter because he doesn't have a Harley. Must be a crotch rocket rider. These songs are fun, fun, fun. Lighten up, MS!"
5,Wrecking Opinions,"Awesome CD! That outta the way, this CD is the best compilation of songs I've seen in thirteen and a half years. There's nothing quite as good as listening to Radar Love, I Can't Drive 55, and On The Road Again all on the same disc set! And the songs on this album, even the mistitled Devil Went Down To Georgia (As I remember it it's called Deuling Fiddles), every single one of them, beats anything you could hear on ""Today's Hit Music Station"". Now, this is my personal opinion, and actually has to deal with a post on the reviews, but Mean Streak needs a life and a few spelling lessons. Sounds to me like Mean Streak is a disgruntled rice-burner boozer with a taste for music about as deep and broad as my pinkie toe. Just my opinion. Oh, and this album is a must-buy."
4,Great Hi-Octane rock & roll,"Can't beat this collection of upbeat rock. ""Bad Company"", ""Hot Blooded"", ""Born To Be Wild"", ""Radar Love"", ""All Right Now"", just to name a few. 2 discs, 30 songs, worth every dime."
3,Some hits and misses,"As a long time motorcyclist, I was hoping this would be a collection of the greatest riding songs ever. It's not. Bob Segar's ROLL ME AWAY and Bon Jovi's DEAD OR ALIVE are not here. It blows my mind that none of the Harley CDs have ROLL ME AWAY but do have Segar's AGAINST THE WIND, which has nothing to do with riding motorcycles. I might of missed the point, but if it's a Harley CD I'm expecting more songs that are about riding or refer to motorcycles in the song."
2,Not like Hediard,"In Paris we loved pates de fruits from Hediard at Place de Madeleine. We thought these might be as good, or at least approximate the ones from Hediard, but they were disappointing. The fact they were made in France was a factor in our decision to try them, but apparently it did not help. Try the ones from Hediard if you can get them. They are incredibly good, bursting with authentic flavor."
1,don't waste your money,"Butterfield , Bloomfield, Bishop et al were a truly innovative blues band. Unfortunately, the sound is so poor that I consider this cd a rip-off. Buy East-West instead..."
1,Say NO to CDs where the source are audience tapes,"It's difficult to rate the music on this release, because the sound is flat-out unacceptible for its medium. Proof that a CD is only good as its source, and in this case, the source is the equivalent of a worn-out boom box in an echo chamber.Otherwise, for releases this unlistenable in sound quality, they should be priced as such."
5,Worked fine for me.,I'm using a Porter-Cable nail gun and I've had no trouble at all using this brand of nail. I like the fact I can buy a small number just to have on hand various different sizes boxes of nails for small projects. With Amazon Prime shipping even if I need a box in a hurry I just order and they are here quickly saving me a trip to town. I've bought lots of boxes of various sizes of B & C Eagle and as mentioned have had no trouble..
5,Very Happy,"Good price, free shipping, fast delivery, high quality.I use these in my Porter-Cable gun. Work perfectly every time. I ordered a second and third box."
1,Don't get sucked in by the overpriced nail bundle,"Bought the nail package with the nail gun, Bad idea! I should have paid attn. to the quantity. Way overpriced & only enough for a small project."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"NAILS too overpriced, like 3 times more than what you would pay elsewhere. 2500 nails costs $28.00 at local store. So, look elsewhere. Very disappointed in price."
3,Marina Chain review,Over all I am satisfied wit product.Pros:Shipped promptly from vendor.Made of silver as advertised.Unit is sturdy and seems to be holding upCons:Clasp is poor design and hard to use.
5,Beautiful and Useful,"I bought this with a pretty whistle and wear it almost daily now. It is strong, functional and very attractive. Just what I hoped and just what I needed."
5,Review,I was/am very pleased with the Crystal Lewis cd. I listen to it whenever i need and uplift and while i am driving. I'm very happy i was able to purchase this through amazon.com and that it was available for purchase.
3,Good Historical Romance,"The one thing that struck me about the main character, Claudia, is that she was not the arch-typical female heroine in so many historical novels who has a perfect body with super model beauty. I could relate to this character, not only because of her angst and lack of confidence in herself, especially regarding body image, but because she also was very talented and became a strong fiery regency era woman. This was a well written historical romance that will have you rooting for Claudia as well as getting all hot and bothered."
4,"Meagan Hatfield reviews Victorian romance, Courting Claudia","Robyn's debut novel, set in Victorian eraLondon, is a true gem!When a handsome bachelor sets hissights on Courting Claudia, with the intentof sweeping her from an arrangedmarriage and into his arms, a wonderfullycharming love story unfolds. Robynseamlessly melds the vibrant setting, withtwo perfectly suited, and wonderfullywritten characters. This is a great story,and an overall awesome read!"
2,Not Bad - but not great either,"I am not sure what kind of books the other reviewers are drawn to - but I failed to notice any real tension between the main characters. We believe they are meant to be together because the author tell us that they are. It really isn't that well written in terms of character development.I found them to be uninspiring and rather flat. Claudia is so caught up in her own poor body image that it made me want to just stop reading. I found her to be weak and mostly annoying. as bad - but I just couldn't find a reason for him to fall in love with Claudia. The father was just an oddly written character- capable of blackmail, nurder and not caring a fig for his daughter - then all of a sudden depressed and drunk. There was NO indication/reason for that to happen. As far as he know, all evidence against him would he care about his daughter anymore when he didn't to start out with.All in all, buy it used if you must read it - because it isn't worth the full price."
4,My first scroll saw book,"This was my first scroll saw book and it has a wide array of patterns for a beginner. I made some smaller basic animals, elephant, camel, etc., a wolf and a cactus that stands upright. A good starter for a beginner."
1,So so,"I used to love this type of music. I liked this CD, especially the cover until I became a christian and realized the evil behind it. I dont own it anymore and am writting this review to get it off my amazon homepage! lolz"
4,A self-contained volume of Logan's adventures in Madripoor,"Overall, a good read. If you're looking for the Hugh Jackman character, you may be disappointed, but as himself Wolverine shines in this. Having never read any X-men comics in colour, I can't pass judgement on the difference between this black and white version and the originals. (I think I was three when these came out the first time).A good mix of back-story, short adventures and multiple issue plots, with character development woven throughout.It was a little frustrating when Wolverine was obliged to remain undercover, but made worth it when he outed himself.Definitely going to order the next volume when I get the money."
4,SUN ZOOM SPARK,"THE ONLY OTHER COMPLETELY LIVE CAPTAIN BEEFHEART ALBUM THAT I HAVE IS RAILROADISM (I'M NOT COUNTING MIRROR MAN) AND THIS ONE IS MUCH BETTER. FIRST OF ALL, THE RECORDING QUALITY IS FAR SUPERIOR. SECONDLY, THE MUSIC SOUNDS BETTER. THIS IS CLASSIC BEEFHEART AT HIS BEST (MOST OF THE TIME). HE SINGS OFFKEY A FEW TIMES, AND THERE IS A VERY ANNOYING HECKLER IN THE CROWD ALL THROUGHOUT THE SHOW, AND BETWEEN SONGS, THERE IS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN HIM AND THE CAPTAIN, WHO EVENTUALLY GETS PRETTY PEED OFF. BUT THIS IS A GREAT CD NEVERTHELESS. I AM GLAD I HAVE A GOOD LIVE RECORDING OF CAPTAIN BEEFHEART AND HIS MUSIC. HIS BAND SOUNDS GREAT, TOO (THE ZILLIONTH VERSION OF THE MAGIC BAND)."
4,Available for years as a bootleg,It's ironic that this concert has been around for years on CD as a bootleg from Europe and that the bootleg is complete unedited and on one disc?? But that aside classic Beef at his best.
4,Good but Older One better,"I got the is for my Mom after she'd had another mug by Enecso Children of the Inner Life. It had a lot of miles on it. Unlike the one I got her years ago, This has raised animation & isn't exactly the same size. I think it's skinnier. Still very cute & conveys feelings well."
4,A little convoluted but good,"The historic footage in this video is great, though it could have used an editor. Any aficionados of Israel or follower of the conflicts in the Middle East will find new material here."
3,Duplication and Mediocrity,"This book does contain some definitions and explanation of health insurance conventions that may be helpful to many. For instance I found the explanation of what to expect from Medicare and the info on Medigap policies informative. As for advice, there are few insights here, mostly platitudes and generalities that should be obvious to anyone (like ""read the policy terms""!) Far worse, the text in this book is EXACTLY IDENTICAL to the book ""Health Insurance Made E-Z"" - so DON'T BUY BOTH!"
4,A good anthology,"""Blown to Smithereens"" is a decent anthology album that collects all of the band's music that the casual fan will ever need to hear. It is also fairly conventional, collecting three songs or so from each of the band's original studio albums. Fortunately, it manages to hit the highlights without leaving out anything truly essential. The best songs include ""Blood & Roses,"" ""A Girl Like You,"" ""Only a Memory"" and ""Yesterday Girl."" Each are three and a half minute blasts of pure guitar pop pleasure. The Smithereens' music is nothing fancy. The guitars are straight forward, the vocals are solid and the lyrics focus on love both won and lost.Overall, this is a fine collection of their singles and should satisfy all but the most ardent fans."
4,"Prepare to be ""Blown"" away.","Whenever I think of The Smithereens, I think of great simple rock n' roll. No gimmicks, no categorizing, just straight-up rock. Nothing here is really that heavy though, and sure you can call it pop-rock, but it's still catchy as hell. And this really does play through like their ultimate album. Who doesn't know ""Blood And Roses"", ""Only A Memory"", or ""Blues Before & After""? Of course ""Girl Like You"" is on here also, with one of the best opening riffs ever. If you only know a few songs here, know that they're all as good as the hits are, roughly. I had ""11"" for many years and didn't think I needed this, but once I got it I truly was ""Blown To Smithereens""."
5,"very few tricks, great magic","I first got into the Smithereens when "" A Girl Like You"" first came out. I have seen them in concert in the early 90's and I really dig the fact that what you hear on CD is what you hear in concert. I feel that one of the traits of a good band is the ability to get your feet moving and the air guitar going as soon as you hear them. Pat Dinizio is definitely an underrated songwriter because he can take an emotion and darken or lighten it as needed to make you feel what he's feeling. This CD is one of the better anthologies out there and it makes you want to check out the rest of their catalog. If you do that, you find that they get better musically and lyrically each time. I highly recommend this one and look forward to more Smithereens in the future."
1,Does NOT fit all CMM1200 lawn mowers,"The description of this blade says that it fits ""CMM1200"" lawn mowers. This isn't completely true.There are three different models of the CMM1200: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. This blade will ONLY fit types 1 and 2.If you have a ""Type 3"" version of the lawn mower, this blade will not fit - the hole is too small to fit over the screw. Instead you need to buy the ""MB-1200"" blade, also available on amazon.I'm not sure how you can tell the difference between the types, but you should probably do some research to find out which type you have before ordering the wrong blade.I'm one-starring this based on the misleading description, not the quality of the product itself."
2,Not well finished,"As has been stated in an earlier review, this blade, despite the photo, is a mulching blade virtually identical in shape to the original blade on my Black & Decker CMM-1000 mower (with a round, not diamond-shaped shaft hole and blade ends curved below the main shaft). However, the finish is pretty rough - it almost seems as if it was a refurbished blade, though I don't think it is (not completely sure, though!). Most disappointing is the fact that it was unbalanced worse than my original blade (which is why I was trying to find a new one). It had two bright grind marks where it looks as if the attempt was made to balance it, but it wasn't by a long shot. Fortunately I had figured out how to balance the original one (balancing it by laying it across a round screwdriver shaft, instead of putting the screwdriver through the shaft hole), so I'm still using the original, and the replacement is waiting for a balance job."
5,Works like a charm,We bought this to freshen up our 10 year old lawnmower. It was easy to install and cuts the grass nice and clean. Good purchase that will extend the life of our lawnmower.
3,VERY TOUGH & WORTH THE MONEY!!,"My chihuahua mix loves to tear apart toys, and usually she does so in 1/2 hour. Not this one... it has withstood her chewing, pulling, and attempts to ""kill"" the toy. Price on Amazon is also cheaper than most stores... the lowest I found was $14. Highly recommended and I will definitely buy more of these toys instead of wasting money on any other dog toy.UPDATE: Changed rating to ""3"" because she was able to tear through the outer lining, but has yet to get to the squeaker. We'll see how long it takes for her to totally destroy it..."
5,Durable and a favorite of my dogs!,"This toy has become a favorite with my three small dogs (ranging in size from 12lbs to 17lbs), two of which are terriers who like to chew, and one a poodle mix who absolutely enjoys fetch. We've taken this toy to the park, and it's always stolen by aggressive chewers, like Boston terriers, bulldogs and pugs - hasn't had any damage yet, and we've had it for about a year. Of course, ALWAYS supervise your dogs with toys - a squeaker, if chewed, could become lodged in their windpipe, toy parts could get stuck in their stomach, etc. That being said, this toy has proven durable and flies pretty far when thrown, especially for something made of fabric and fluff."
1,Unsafe for chewers,"Purchased one of this company's very expensive toys. Never again. One-year old pups managed to have a hole in it within 30 minutes, and removed the squeaker -- a choking hazard. After repairs, I gave it back to one of my pups, who managed to entirely de-stuff it within minutes. E-mailed the manufacturer to give them feedback, but they weren't interested; they basically said don't let the dog chew on it. How else is a dog to play with a toy? They don't exactly have hands. Keep your pet safe and your wallet fuller and don't buy this absurdly priced dud of a toy.l.;'[]"
3,I got mine autographed!,"This Christmas CD features The Crypt Keeper(John Kassir) singing parodies of Christmas songs. The songs are done with the same type of ""ghoulish"" puns that were used on theTV show. If you enjoyed the Crypt Keeper's sense of humor on his TV show, you should enjoy this CD."
5,New condition from a used cd,"I was a little skeptical of buying a used cd online, but i went against my better instinct and did so anyway, it turned out to be a very good decision, i opened the case and it was literally like-new! very happy with the product, and very satisfied i would definitely recommend this seller."
1,A Mickey Mouse Camera,"Very hard to use. Couldn't get the film out once we took the pictures. Very disappointing for my 5 year old grandson who was so excited when he got it. It has a 1 year warranty, so I will try that remedy"
3,Review,"I purchased these items to have spares on hand, as I don't know how long these replacement products will be available because the weed-wacker they go to are very old.This was just a convenience purchase for an ordinary item."
2,not for children over 6 yrs old,"I purchase this game for my niece who is nine. The machine is indeed very simple to but together(takes just a few minutes, instructions are not very helpful). There are several problems with this machine. First, the machine is not very stable, tends to tip forward. The legs need to be placed completely flat and not used as a tripod or else the machine will tip forward. Also, if you don't angle it properly, the balls will not come out.The secondly,this machine is listed to be good for all ages; it's not. When we set up the machine we found that it pitched too low for the average 9 yr old. When we placed it on a table it worked a little better but the overall machine was still very unstable. Having to use an additional stand makes this machine not very conducive to be taken to the park. Also, it uses up a lot of batteries( have to change batteries very two hours....)"
4,Fantastic!,"This CD is truly remarkable in the sound and content- Eric is a one-of-a-kind composer with fresh ideas. The only thing I found disappointing is that a few songs I really like, such as Sleep, were not recorded on this album (in wind ensemble arrangement). However, it did show me some of his other works, which I had never heard of before."
5,Groundbreaking historical performances,"When I left the Beatles and Beach Boys for other forms of rock and roll, I found the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and East-West. This album was SO good that my mother even let me play it a high volume and eventually drove me to the Fillmore to see the band when I was in 9th grade. Unfortuntely, I did not know that Bloomfield had just left the group and was about to form the Electric Flag (a group I was able to see live later in 1967). But I still had the album East-West and aquired their earlier work, which also a powerful set of songs.If you dig the history of rock and roll and especially the evolution of the blues/rock guitar, you will like this album and you need to hear it; if you like Mike Bloomfield it is a no-brainer. Thanks to Mark Naftalin for having the sense to get some on tape during what was most likely a chaotic road experience and for preserving these recordings. I easily forgive the fidelity and deeply cherish the playing."
3,Intense Action but where's the Fun and Twists?,"Wow, does this book pack in the action. A couple on their honeymoon stumble into an ugly scene, and all hell breaks loose, sending mild schockwaves all the way to the White House. But it comes off like watching a 14 year-old play a violent video game-- at first you are thrilled by the skill, death, and wildness, but soon you get bored of the same style, and feel detached from it all.Literally everything or everyone in this book gets killed, mutilated, sliced and destroyed in one way or another. Fine. But to focus on that and avoid fun plot twists or Clancy-esque White House schemings was overkill. And the characters are not engaging except for one college goofball-- you just don't think these people are realistic at all because everyone is some super athlete, weapons expert ninja or something.For action-loving males, you'll have fun with this one. But I'm not sure you'll remember it."
3,Amatuerish: Shouldn't have been published,"The book would have been better if it were written by a college student, because then I would accept its major flaws. Owen West does a good job in holding your attention for some nice moments of suspense, but he does a horrible job of character development. One minute a character is naturally cool, a few pages the character could be described as nervous and naturally a bit of a geek. Killing off some of the main characters in corny manner doesn't help either.West also seems to be overly obsessed with the Eco-Challange. After the fourth reference to it, I felt like taking the subway to West's Wall St. job, and then strangling him while yelling ""I get the idea, you ran the Eco-Challenge once!!"" The ending was kind of cheesy too (corny in so many different ways). West obviously has some potential, but I think I will wait for his sixth book, once he has polished off his skills a little."
3,Nice decorative vase,"It is a nice vase for the price you pay. It looks really great in the entrance of my house. The color is a tiny bit darker than the picture, but it's fine. The material is very light and you have to assemble it yourself, which it's not big deal. The floral crafts are very pretty. Overall it's a nice product for a fair price."
5,Great product,"We love these, we had to put some sand in the bottom to make them more stable so the large plants won't knock them over."
4,good price for a good book,"With the current sale on Amazon, this is a very good price for a good book. The materials may be a little too detail for what you need, and dang it, the book is heavy. But if you have the time, it is a good book to go through with. As in 2005, I will still prefer NMS over Qbook if I can only pick one. But I will go with both if I have the time. I'll think twice though if NMS does not come up with any new edition in 2006 or later. Now, I have always been curious if Qbook consists of the majority of questions in Qbank. Kaplan won't tell, of course."
1,Kaplan Medical USMLE Step 3 Book Review :0(,"I used this book as preparation for the USMLE step III and found that it covered the material in excessive detail, far more than what was reflected on the actual exam. It was so ""specific"" that I got lost in the minuitia. It requires you to know much more than is required, which hurt me in the end. The CCS portion and dermatology sections were not well represented. I did poorly on these portions of the exam and would recommend an additional text or interactive CD for those components of the exam. Take the CCS section very seriously, for it is a whopping 20% of your score which is very important!There are no pictures in this text, which makes it less optimal. I also used Swanson's Family practice book which was not any better, despite its raving reviews. The format was not at all reflective of that of the USMLE Step III. May your outcome be better than mine! Best wishes."
4,My uncle,"Hey, I read this book when I was a teenager - my uncle is the one who wrote it and it's dedicated to my father. At any rate, the story is how it is seen by the writer. That's what history or biographies - especially of people who have since moved to the Grand Ol' Opry up there - do. I was not into Country and Western, but I enjoyed, to a degree, the story of the man's life. Maybe it wasn't word for word dictation, but then the Bible, a best seller, isn't either (no disrespect meant there, folks)."
4,Functioned but some stips arrived broken,These nails functioned without a problem in my Hitachi NR90GR. 2 of the strips were broken in transit due to poor packaging.
3,Sinatra 80th is a fun CD!,"This is simply a fun recording. It is not Sinatra at his very best, but Old Blue Eyes is clearly enjoying himself as he sings these classic songs. The album is basically a collections of live cuts from the mid to late eighties, with the rather odd but delightfull duet of My Way with Pavarotti. Its not as good as Sinatra Sextet Live In Paris, nor is it a ""must have"" like the Australia concert from '59. But it is enjoyable. Its the sort of Sinatra album you might play at a party later in the evening when a lot of your guests are drunk and having a good time."
3,Pleasantly surprised and worth a listen. Pavarotti?,"This is a 3rd tier CD as far as Sinatra is concerned. (Thus, the 3 stars.) I was pleasantly surprised when I got this CD at auction. If Frank is 80, then I'm 100! This is not essential Sinatra, but if you ever have the chance to listen, do so! Frank really seems to be having a good time at these two concerts and, although his voice sounds a little rough a times, you'll usually hear the Sinatra of the late 60's and early 70's as you tap your toes and snap your fingers ""In Concert""!"
4,THIS IS A FUN ALBUM,"I enjoyed the spirit on this one. It brings make a lot of memories from when I saw Frank in Vegas. His voice is pretty good on here but his phrasing and use of drama to enhance the songs are SUPERB. If u never gotta a chance to see the man, this is it."
4,Good charger but do it with care,"This is a very good charger but I found that it works best with Powerex brand battery. With other brand, sometime it can get really hot and take a longtime.For example one time I charge 8 1100 mmAh AAA batteries and after 4 hours I had to stop because the batteries got way too hot. So be carefull."
4,Charger,Seems like a great charger; would recommend. Better than destroying your exspensive batteries with dumb chargers. Hope it lasts; without planned destruction so many companies build into products... our earth's resources are not expanding. My only complaint is that this company does not have a solar option open on smart chargers (that I know of).
1,"Great features, but it catches on fire.","This charger has lots of nice features but I don't trust it in terms of safety. I bought this model a few years back from another distributor and it actually caught on fire. I sent it to the manufacturer for warranty replacement, and the one they sent me caught on fire as well. Sent that one back and the third one didn't catch on fire, but I did detect that unmistakable odor of burning plastic. So finally I sent it back for a full refund. I am currently using a different charger from the same company (the MH C-9000) and it works wonderfully. It simply appears that the MH-C808M charger is not one of Maha's better models. My advice, don't buy this charger."
2,Mixed feelings...,"1) This product needed a better manual.2) It'd be nice if the product had the basic info printed on it. That would explain what various actions mean - or even how to put it in soft charge mode. Some extra buttons would be nice too. (ie: being able to quick charge a few while re-conditioning other batteries would be helpful).3) Issues with batteries getting hot. Not all batteries most remain cool just a few seem to get hot. Nothing to pin point, as the ones that overheat are the same brands and ones that work fine. Not an age issue as it has occurred with newer batteries too.4. Caution, if you do not seat the battery ALL the way. The unit has the potential to overheat as some of the plastic on our unit melted.***All in all, I am left not trusting the device. Don't like to leave it plugged in overnight. Read lots of rave reviews, but must confess I am have been left a bit disappointed and do not really trust the product.:-("
4,"works fine, but instructions could be better","This charger seems to work well. I like the fact that it's made of high quality materials. Powerex makes really awesome rechargable batteries, so i'm assuming that their chargers are also well-made.I think the instructions will leave you with a lot of questions. For example: 1. what happens if you leave the charger on overnight? is it safe for the batteries to stay in the charger once they're already fully charged? 2. what does it mean when you put in a battery, and the display remains blank?you can email the company and they'll answer your specific questions.there are only 2 buttons on this thing--one is to activate the slow charge, and the other is to activate the rejuvenation cycle(useful for old batteries or after every 10th charge). i wish it had a cover to protect it from dust.that's all folks! enjoy it. oh by the way, it IS safe to leave the batteries in the charger even after they're fully charged. Maha responded to my email re: that question."
1,Utter crap,"I've had this charger for a long time and it's been flakey from the start but not enough to notice. It didn't ever seem to do as good a job of fully charging my batteries as my cheap charger but I wasn't too bothered until recently when I can't even get batteries to hold a charge from this POS. What's worse is there's no indication that there's a problem, it just shows ""done"" as always. I put batteries into my camera from this thing and they didn't last 10 seconds. I've tried many different nimh batteries and they all do the same. I wanted to love this charger and I thought it'd be the last charger I'd ever need but I was so very very wrong.Bottom line: Don't get it. It looks awesome but it constantly disappoints."
3,"good charger, but did not last","Nice, long 3-year warranty--It's a capable charger that did give me three years of good service, but it developed some problems 3 1/2 years in. The last battery bay showed indicated a battery present when there was no battery in it. Also some of the batteries began charging unevenly. It was not hard to get a pleasant, well-spoken tech support person, but by the time I got around to making the return it had been 4 years, and the best they could do is offer me was a 25discount off the list price- which is the same as buying a new one shipped from Amazon. Guess I'll try the Ansmann next.2/19/13 edit- gave it 3 stars instead or 2 for excellent customer service and a good product to begin with. I left it plugged in for over 3 years straight so I can't really complain."
2,Great Charger - But LCD fades to blank over 20 minutes,Charger works great - but over a 20 minute time the display fades away and you have guess what the status is.
5,Great Charger,Saves me money! Works just as described. I have also brought old batteries back to life as other reviewers have said. I have 4 kids that use ALOT of batteries. It has paid for itself! I would purchace again. I haven't had any over heating issues.
5,The Only Charger to Buy,"I have been using this product for around 5 years now and I don't know how I got along without it before. There are 2 settings for charging: one for quick charges and one for slow ""conditioning"" charges. I find the slow charging is fast enough for me. The 8 completely independent stations are monitored on an LCD panel. This is very easy to use, and works with AA, AAA, and D batteries. I wish it worked with 9v."
5,Worth it!,"this is a high quality, full featured battery charger. Not the cheapest but worth it and, if you're making the investment in rechargeable cells, why wouldn't you get a good charger?"
4,Better than expected,"I had a to get a new charger because the cheap energizer and other 15 minute chargers kept burning out. This charger stays cool, brought back a few dead AA batteries to life and keeps the batteries cool during charge and while maintaining the charge. You can keep this plugged in without worry. I do wish that it had ability to charge 9v batteries. It is a little pricey, but I haven't found or used anything better.1 year later update:It seems to charge the Powerex batteries much better then the other rechargeables. I have recently purchased some of the Imedions and they seem to be fantastic as they drain slow and charge quickly with this charger. Still have no issues and have no dead terminals. Would like to add that the batteries are easy to get in and out of. Also seems to be able to handle charging multiple battery sizes at the same time. Which is a huge plus because I don't need to charge 8 of any single size at a time."
2,Thought it was good,"I bought this a few years ago. It worked fine for the most part. I leave my AA and AAA batteries on the charger and let it tend to them. Well.. one Saturday I was at home and I heard a very loud ""BANG""... went to the kitchen where the charger was and I saw that there was a black burnt mark on one of the battery terminals. I found pieces of a rechargeable in a few places on the floor. It must have overcharged the battery causing it to blow up.Kind of scary. Glad I wasn't near it when it went off. Needless to say, I trashed it and got a different one."
2,Half of AA slots don't work after a year,"After warranty expired, 6 of the 8 AA slots don't work while all the AAA still work. I've been charging only PowerEx IMedion 2100 mAh AA and 800 mAh AA batteries. The company offered to replace with a 25% discount, but that brings the replacement price down to $82.46.I expected more quality for this lightly used charger, so I couldn't recommend this model to others."
2,Great charger - short life,"We purchased this charger almost 2 years ago. We have had no problems with it - charged our Tenergy batteries with no issues. We did not use this charger daily - maybe once every 2 weeks. That being said, we tried to charge our C batteries yesterday and it wasn't working properly. It had been unplugged, so I left it plugged in thinking it might need to cycle to start up. About 20 minutes later, our nanny said there was a strong burning odor in our laundry room, and sure enough it was the charger.Excellent product for the time we had it, but for the price I would expect it to last much longer. With that and the fire hazard it posed, we will not purchase this product again."
5,Great Reference,Being new to the disease I found this to be a time-saving directory of information and academic sources.
3,Won't work with the PC FR530 Nail Gun,"These may be great nails, but they'll probably jam and misfire with the Porter Cable FR530 nail gun. The FR530 needs plastic-collated nails, not paper-collated like these are. I made the mistake of buying a ... case of paper-collated nails, only to have non-stop problems with them. Only on the Porter Cable website does it mention that the gun uses plastic-collated."
3,Flimsy packaging,Primary packaging is pretty flimsy. (lightweight cardboard) The overpack (wadded up paper) was effective though because no broken sticks!
5,No complaints,"I've gone through a box of these without one jam in my Milwaukee 7100 nailer. Many of the poor reviews of the nails relate to the Porter Cable nailer. Maybe the issue is with the nailer and not the nails. Poor reviews of the PC nailer is one of the reasons I went with Milwaukee. The nails were shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. If you don't need a large number of nails, these are the prefect answer."
4,Worked as expected,"Had some broken sets on arrival, but for the most part was fine. My biggest problem is that they don't feed smoothly all the time."
4,texastweety,"This was the first time I've used a nailgun. So it's a little hard to declare a comparable review. But the nails arrived in fine shape, worked great in the gun I bought. Haven't had a problem with them at all. Not sure about the price though. I might check around before buying again. But I thought that a box of nails you hammer in are pretty expensive also...so I tried these out and they worked fine. Got the 3"" and 2 3/8"" also....no problem with any of them."
1,BRIO Polar Express Battery Train,"My grandson is a Polar Express Train expert. He was very disappointed that the train didn't really look like the movie train. He liked the whistle, but that was a very expensive whistle."
5,Brio Polar Express Battery-Operated Train,"Great little hand-held or floor toy for the youngest train enthusiast. Two train sounds are great. Moves very well. Too bad it has been discontinued from the company, especially since Polar Express is still popular."
4,sent wrong trimmer,"Trimmer works great, but I waS sent the wrong one. Needed it for work so didn't have time to send it back for the correct one."
1,Extremely PO'd !!!,On the description and picture it clearly suggest you are getting the pink breast cancer awareness clipper but it is actually a pink camo one. Which personally i did not want so i am not happy at all. Do not buy from this person!
5,Black and White Vintage Cat photography,"I am a cat lover, but also love vintage photography. This book combines them both in a beautiful way. There are some newer photos too, and they are all in B/W. I keep this book on my coffee table, and I flip through it all the time- it is timeless. I think it would be a wonderful gift for any cat lover or a fan of photography."
3,Works for minimalist,I bought this item for my 14 ft Jon boat and it works on the lakes and such but wouldn't take it out on the river with the current. It is a cheap anchor for a cheap price and would be more fitted for a pwc like a wave runner under the seat. Works for what I need but once it breaks (and it will) I will be buying something else. The item has a lock ring that allows it to expand and it feels cheaper but for the money its good.
2,Cheap?,"First time out the grapnel literally snapped-off. May have been the muddy bottom of the lake. I had to use the motor to try and free-up the anchor, but either way, now I just have a post."
3,So So,This anchor did not hold well in soft sand - the type of sand typically found near the shore on the beach. The waverunner I tied up using this anchor slowly drifted down the lake.The anchor was well made and looked ok. The rope included was hollow.
4,Kwik Tek Anchor,"As always, shipping was quick, Anchor came in nice bag. like the float on the end so you can un hook and find it again later."
3,Good!,"Product arrived as stated, no problems, everything ok.Good price, within my expectations.Do not served much use for my need for a product that would support more weight into the sea with waves."
1,Tiny anchor,this thing is little! Might be good for a bass boat. Don't think ill b trying it on mine! Good lunck
3,"Works well enough, but it's fragile and breaks easily","Engages nicely and is easy to use, but the tines break off very easily. Basically this is not quite strong enough."
3,maybe for a small ski,i have a 3 passenger seadoo and this thing just doesnt hold. it does fit nicely in my storage compartment and with the padded case it doesnt clunk around to much.
4,An Eye On Ears,"Notoco 1408 PETSCOPE Ear Scope OtoscopeBeing a home groomer to two Goldendoodles I learned that I need to take maticulous care of my dogs' ears. Because my dogs are one half Poodle hair grows inside their ears that needs to be plucked routeinly. Also their ears hang down making it an ideal place to have problems, so I decided to purchase the Notoco 1408 PETSCOPE to help me keep an eye on the condition of their ears. The $27.50 I paid seemed a fair price to pay for a home groomer and the ear scope works great as I can see every thing I need to; however the viewing tips have a tendency to fall off since they are made to snap onto the scope. I would have prefered the tips screwed into the scope to make the tips more secure. Purchased through Amazon.com"
3,OK Hard Techno,"Not much to say about this one. It is hard minimal techno, in the standard meaning of the phrase. Pretty good, but not a must.+g"
4,Good Starter and Advanced Learning book,Good Starter and Advanced Learning book. Author describes the basics of pigeon genetics for the beginner and helps the breeder through learning with examples. Can also help the more advanced breeder to get the rare color/pattern figured out.
4,Great Toy! Ive been waiting for this for years!,"Its a great transformer. Its only flaw is that the robot modes ""wings"" never seem to want to snap into place without a fight. its really durable and except for the wings it is really fun to transform and play with. Its transformation is rather simple compared to earlier transformers lines and its a good toy for a 5 - 12 yr old child (with a little help). Unicron has always been my favorite bad guy and im so glad that he's finally here in toy form."
1,Huge disappointment,"My son is 6 1/2 and was terribly let down with this toy. It took about 20 minutes to get the darn thing out of the box since it was tied down with tons of twisted security wires. Then, neither he, my husband nor I (both collage grads)could figure how to turn it into a planet. The directions are terrible. The worse part is that I emailed Hasbro over a week ago and haven't even gotten a reply yet. I can't believe we wasted so much money on this. The minicons and reg. Transformers keep my son busy for hours. Stick with those and save your money."
3,Did not get all items described.,"We ordered this for our son's birthday. We thought we were getting the mini-con, and we did not get it. We also noticed a piece missing from the leg. So we didn't even get the ""complete, with mini con Unicron"" that we paid for."
5,Don't buy here,Got to toys r us and get it for $50. These people charging almost $100 is ridiculous!
3,Poetic pilot of yesteryear,"Cecil Lewis takes us through world war one as a fighter ace inthe RFC and in particular the famous 56 squadron which hosted such legends as Mannock, Ball, McCudden and Bishop, to name a few.Although this is an interesting book, I found the story almostlike a Biggles tale with terms like rot and ripping.Some of the facts are hazy,Lewis says McCudden was shot down andkilled,in fact McCudden died when engine failure caused him tocrash. For devotees of WW1,McCuddens Flying Fury ,is ,in my opinion, a better rendering with a wealth of photographs whichbring a sense of realism somewhat lacking in Sagittarius Risingc"
4,A gallant youth discovers flight and his love for life,"Lewis preserves the days when flying machines were still mystical and miraculous machines, when brave young men took to the skies in aircraft of wood and fabric, and when these youthful men battled in the air with each other just for the chance to live and fly another day. Lewis is probably the best flyer-pilot I have read; he avoids the automated style of some military authors, and provides the reader with an easy-to-read, smooth-flowing narrative. Lewis' eloquent narration not only puts one in the cockpit, but also into his heart. And there one finds a young man who discovers his love and wonder for life amidst the clouds. Lewis' detailed accounts of aircraft, tactics and wartime activities are invaluable to the history of military aviation."
2,Of Limited General Interest,"This memoir of a British WWI pilot is pretty uneven and likely only to be enjoyed by those with a particular interest in military aviation history or WWI. Lewis' narrative is fine when he describes his enlistment, training, and adventures as a pilot both over France and in home defense. Whenever he attempts to describe life outside these areas--his minor romantic entanglements, the big ""drunks"" the officers would have, and his views on life and human nature--the writing is very weak and ordinary. This is especially true in the latter portion of the book, which recounts his postwar activities in China. He does a good job, however, of conveying the sketchiness of those early days of flying around in wood and cloth machines with little more than a compass to guide one. A more entertaining WWI flying saga is the fictional The Emperor's Coloured Coat, the second in John Biggins' Otto Prohaska quartet and its followup, The Two-Headed Eagle."
3,Better on poetry than realism,"I read this book because I'm interested in the history, and especially in how pilots of the period were trained and learned their craft. The author is pretty much of the ""what a wonderful war"" crowd, plus a few obligatory asides about how horrible it must be for the guys down in the trenches. For example his ""romantic encounters"" end with walks arm in arm through the moonlight, and some poetic reflection on how things might have turned out. His descriptions of technology, tactics, aircraft and so forth are little better.So read it if you want to know how war in the air was not all ""hell."""
5,Sagittarius Rising - reviewed,It's a little early for me to fully review this book as I haven't completely read it yet - but I have started and what I have read so far is very good. The book holds the atmosphere and wonderful descriptions from a lost and bygone era. The book feeds the technical fascination for the early bi-planes in a very human way which is both compelling and believable. Seen through the eyes of a young trainee pilot the book takes you through his basic training and the early flying experiences as an officer in the RFC. The book describes the military culture of the time and describes the young man's reaction to living on his nerves and the constant loss of his flying pals. The book still manages to convey the unbounded excitement the author had for flying the old bi-planes.For anyone who has a similar interest in this period of early aviation or WW1 history I would have no hesitation in recommending this book to them.
3,High-flier,"Cecil had a relatively ""good"" time in WWI - at least he discovered his lifelong love of flying (& he survived to enjoy it!). The descriptions of flying were interesting, but I'm too much of a landlubber to enjoy them."
3,Smells Fabulous But Feels Sticky,"I bought this because I really like the Pink Sugar perfume. It smells great, just like the perfume, but I can't figure out what the purpose of it is other than to make you smell nice. It has the consistency of a styling milk and I find it's slightly sticky when I put it on. Doesn't really leave much gloss and it doesn't moisturize. It's a nice way to wear the scent, as it does linger. I wear it instead of the perfume rather than with it, though, as it's too strong to wear them together. The lingering scent is really nice, but I think I am going to try the mousse next time."
1,sugar water,It smells like sugar water. Don't waste your money - Only buy it if you have smelled it and liked the smell. Otherwise don't risk wasting your money.
2,Not What I Expected,"I didn't like this fragrance at all. Based on the the description and name of this perfume, I expected it to smell sweet, fruity and fun. It was none of those things. In fact, my husband thought it smelled like ""old people and baby powder.""Who wants to smell like that?"
1,questioning..,This doesn't have aquolina printed on the bottle. every bottle should have the name on it. so this one is a knock off forsure. they just good at imitating bestselling brands. i feel sorry for all those great reviews u may be getting something else rather than the real deal.
4,SUGAR EVERYDAY,Pink Sugar is a good everyday fragrance that is not overpowering or offensive. I receive many complements whenever I wear it.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this perfume as a gift. It arrived quickly, but is a tester. The description did not say it was a tester. I would not have purchased if the description would have mentioned it was a tester. The seller should do a better job of explaining the product. I didn't read the comments by other buyers, so I am partly to blame."
3,Smells great but not a good deodorant,"So I DO know the difference between anti-antiperspirant and deodorant but I have also used some great deodorants that work perfectly in hot humid weather... this is not one of those. While the scent is great when you first spray it on, on a hot day, it does not mix well with regular person perspiration smell, and it's not like I'm a really sweaty and smelly, for the record."
4,Great Perfume,This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.
1,Alls I smell is licorice :(,"The only thing I smell is over powering black licorice. It makes me feel sick. I hate that smell. I thought it was going to smell like cotton candy, cookies and vanilla, like everybody keeps saying."
2,So so...,"The aroma was a bit like a cheap cologne. I was not too impressed. I was hoping to a mild, fresh aromatic product"
4,Smells great,"I've always wanted to try Pink Sugar and was glad to have found it on Amazon at a good price. It smells as good as I imagined, nice and sweet but not childish, although it doesn't last more than a couple hours on me. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a different kind of scent."
4,"Fun, flirty scent in travel size","I sampled this perfume at some big-box fragrance store and then headed straight to Amazon to pick it up at a reasonable price.Pros: Fragrance (subjective, but whatever), size (under three ounces means it's travel-friendly), cap is secure on bottle, bottle is nicely designed - it's cylindrical shape makes it a snap to pack or carry as compared to some more ""unique"" fragrancesCons: I tend to spray it in the air and then walk through rather than directly applying it as it's a bit strong for me"
5,The BEST candy perfume on the planet,"This is the most amazing, intriguing, and YUMMY perfume my wife has ever tried. As long as everyone on the planet is NOT using it she'll keep it in her arsenal. She's one of those that has to be different so if this ever gets popular she'll choose something else.This stuff smells like a mix between cotton candy and subtle fresh baked cookies without that sickly sweet smell of other ""candy"" style perfumes.I can't possibly say how much I love this stuff. It's that good.As a bonus it's cheaper on Amazon than on other sites."
5,wow,"From reading the reviews I was kind of skeptical if this would be good for me. Heavy scents are not good on me, so I look for the lighter, feminine ones that compliment me personally. This one is very feminine, light & sweet. One note is this scent is sweet enough for a younger teenager, yet still feminine enough for someone older. To me this scent is flirty, feminine, soft & a little bit sensual. Great combination for a perfume."
5,My signature scent!,I LOVE this EDT spray! I found a bottle at a Florida flea market and have been ordering bottles from Amazon ever since! I hope it never gets discontinued!
2,might be great for kids,"I was totally upset. I was soooo excited to get this item and purchased it based on the review...bad idea! Its way, way too sweet. Since I already purchased it I have to find a way to use it...so I'm thinking air freshener or not?!?"
3,good,ok first of all i got this VERY EARLy it was suppose to come on the 6th of feb and i got it on the 2nd. it smells very yummy and its a pretty big bottle for the price! the only thing i am alil iffy about is i think i may have gotten a fake one?? im not sure. but it does not say Aquolina on it AT ALL. it just says pink sugar so it may be a knock off but for 14 bucks i guess i get what i pay for haha. i mean I COULD BE WRONG i have no clue im just saying it MAY be fake. it may not. it loks exacly like the other bottles it just doesnt have the chili pepper or say Aquolina other then that its a very sweet smeelling vanillia and i like it and im so glad it came early!
3,"Not so ""sugary"" after all","I thought I would try out this perfume after hearing so many positive reviews. I was looking for a ""food"" scent to add to my collection of perfume--- hopefully some sweet and dessert-like as many of the reviews described. Unfortunatly, to me, this begins with a blast of cotton candy but then, within a minute, goes straight into a harsh black licorice smell until the scent wears off. At some points, I would get hints of a dark jelly bean or hard candy, but I never got any hints of sweet sugariness like I was imagining. I went ahead and gave it three stars because for the price, you do receive a lot, and licorice and cotton candy are in the notes. For me, though, I found no hints of any fruits, vanilla, or carmel."
5,So Sweet and Cute,"I love this perfume! It smells so sweet and yummy. Every time that I put it on I get complimented on how good I smell, and who doesn't love that? Before I bought it online, I went to Sephora to smell it and try it on and I instantly fell in love with it. I waited patiently to order it online though, instead of right then and there. Because from Amazon it was about $20.00 dollars cheaper. Oh how I love Amazon. Anyway, this perfume is great and it only takes a little to smell so wonderful all day. I love it, my boyfriend loves it, and I have yet to be told that it is too strong or too overwhelming. I suggest getting it if you want to smell good and feel good!"
3,Nice Pink Sugar scent,"Let me start by saying I LOVE Pink Sugar! This was the first time I ordered the hair perfume, and when it's empty I will go back to actually spraying the EDT in my hair. The silicone makes my hair feel soft, but does not add much for shine. Nice enough, but nothing near the EDT."
1,Fake Product,This product was to be Pink Sugar by Aquolina. The product I received was called Pink Sugar but it definetely was not by Aquolina. It is a fake/fraud product. Not made by the actual company Aquolina. Looks like the product but is missing the key company name and the fragrance smells nothing like the actual product. I'm returning this product. I'm glad I had the original to compare it too. Was very disappointed I didn't receive the authentic fragrence and have to go through all the trouble to return it then re-order the true product.....hopefully....
1,Calgon's Marshmallow is better,"This stuff just smells gross. At first, it smells really sweet, but there is this really chemically, musky undertone that just kills my nose! I expected the entire bouquet to be sweet. Try Calgon's Marshmallow body spray."
1,Gross,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of food inspired beauty products.I have lotions from Bath and Body Works, half of Jessica Simpson's Dessert line and soap that smells like lemon drops.This stuff was just plain disgusting.I went to ULTA and tried it so excited after reading the reviews.After trying it I spent over an hour waiting for the terrible smell to go away.It smelled like licorice or something.I ended up smelling something by Jennifer Lopez instead and it was way better.I won't tell you not to buy this but please try it first.I don't think it will agree with everyone or at least it didn't with me."
2,Jamaicafan,This is a knock off and not the real Aquolina Hair Perfume. Sephora sells the real item. The bottle is clearly different and the real product has a sweeter scent not so alcohol heavy. This is still a decent product but they should disclose that its a knock off and not the real thing.
2,Smells burnt,I don't care for the smell of this at all. I was hoping to find something comparable to Hypnotic Poison. This isn't it.
1,FAKE.,"I was sp excited to get this in the mail today... but as ot turns out, its a fake. The packaging gave ot away right away. No evidence of the brand. Thanks a lot amazon. Waste of money."
3,i WiSH i WOULD HAVE LOVED iT AS MOST SEEM TOO...,"i ORDERED THiS PERFUME SiNCE i SEEN ALL THE GREAT REViEWS...iT DOESN'T SMELL LiKE MUCH TO ME OTHER THAN VANiLLA EXTRACT. iT DOES GiVE MY HAiR SOME EXTRA SHiNE BUT THATS ABOUT iT. iM NOT FOND OF THE SMELL AS i HOPE i'D BE :( NEXT TiME i'LL OPT FOR SOMETHiNG THAT SMELLS LiGHT, FRESH AND CLEAN."
3,Good Product,"The product arrived in perfect condition; however, I received it several days later than expected. I hope that this can be attributed to poor weather conditions, as I hope to continue doing business with the seller."
5,Best scent!!!,I have tried many designer brands in the past. This is the ONLY one I have ever gotten continuous excellent comments on. From the youngest to the oldest. Love love love this perfume. It has become my signature scent. Will ALWAYS buy it!
5,Best stuff ever!,"Pink Sugar is the best perfume I have ever used! It's light enough to not overwhelm, but has just the right amount of feminine fragrance to get noticed! It has a sweet, yet clean scent that is AMAZING!!!"
5,I love it!,"I get compliments on this. It's light and fun! I bought it without smelling it first, based on the reviews. I was looking for ""Angel Rocker"" and found it was supposed to be a clone of this."
3,ok,"I like the sweet smell of vanilla but it doesn't last all day. Still it's a good product,I use sometimes."
3,LOTION,THIS LOTION WAS VERY RUNNY AND DID NOT HAVE THE WONDERFUL SMELL THAT I WAS HOPING FOR.. I BOUGHT TWO FOR GIFTS SO WAS NOT AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE I BOUGHT THE OTHER ONE.
5,pink sugar sweet smelling goodness,"Pink Sugar is perfect for teens, nice and sweet perfume. Pink Sugar is a fresh smell of cotton candy, perfect for parties, and I am 14 and I highly reccomend to all teens and friends, This perfume will leave you a beautiful splash of cotton candy all day"
3,"Love the product, bottle defective","I love pink sugar Aqualina so I ordered it at a good price from Amazon. I noticed by the third day the spray pump was mal-functioning and it does not spray properly. Well, that was a waste of money.Again - the product if working properly is awesome. This was my first and only issue with buying something through Amazon."
4,Great for sweetening too flowery or musky fragrances..,"I layered Pink Sugar and Lush's Karma perfume, which it heavy on bergomot and patchouli, it really brought the sweetness down. Real cotton candy scent on it's own. I love it but it seems nearly embarrassing to wear on its own at my age. I think mixing may be the only way to go with this one but it has a place in my fragrance wardrobe, like a rhinestone clip or bright scarf."
4,Great item for smell...,"however, in Texas, the spray really doesn't cut down on humidified hair (the frizzies). Will purchase again because the product does smell wonderfull and does leave hair shiney!"
3,Not the exact scent,"Is nice enough but doesn't have the signature ""cotton candy"" smell that I was looking for from a Pink Sugar product. A lot of vanilla pulls through which is nice but not what I was looking for. It smells kind of common and not like the ""signature"" scent that I am familiar with from Pink Sugar."
1,Rancid!,The parfume came very discolored and extremely rancid smelling! Worst part was that now I find out that YOU CANNOT RETURN OR EVEN EXHCHANGE the bottle because they classify it as hazardous material!!!What a very Big disappointment!!
5,Sweetness!!,"MEN AND WOMEN love the smell of this perfume, there are compliments every time I wear it...The packaging container is adorable as well.....you cannot go wrong with this selection...."
5,Yummmm!,This is the first time I have purchased this perfume and I based it on others reviews. I am so glad I did. This perfume is fabulous. It is not too sweet and lasts a long time. It is just delish!
5,Unusually Great Deal,"Both my wife and my daughter loves the smell of Aquolina Pink Sugar Perfume. During the Xmas season, it was selling for just under a hundred dollars for this size. Then after Xmas, I found it on Amazon for a fraction of the msrp and bought two of the large 3.4os bottles for my wife and daughter. They were completely happy with this after Xmas present."
4,Not the best scent ever; but decent enough to still wear.,"I purchased this fragrance from Sephora's website because I needed something more playful and youthful than my other scents. When it arrived and I sprayed it, I was a little disappointed that the perfume smells EXACTLY like the Cotton Candy Fantasy spray that one could purchase at Rite Aid for $5. I am aware that this is supposed to smell like the treat; however, I thought that Aquolina would personalize this scent a little more. Perhaps a hint of cotton candy surrounded by notes of vanilla would have done the trick. Nonetheless, I still enjoy wearing this to casual events, as it is appealing."
2,Too Powdery,"I was expecting sweet and yummy. This is very powdery and overwhelming. I only sprayed it twice and 5 hours later it is still way too strong for me. It could just be my personal taste, but I just don't like it. Lessoned learned, fragrances are too personal to order online for the first time before smelling them. I am returning this."
1,Unbelievably Bad Product,"Do not buy - Smells like cotton candy for 3 seconds and then becomes putrid. You think you are saving money but you are really losing in the long run. Again - do not buy!**UPDATE** Apparently, the company that produces this fragrance has decided to remove their logo from the bottles and the outer case [....] The new bottle I ordered from Sephora's website looked exactly the same as the knock off from Amazon. The real one smells 100X's better. I've learned that somethings are too good to be true. If you're going to pamper yourself - or someone else- do it the right way and splurge by purchasing from a company that sells the real thing. (This same size cost $22 on Sephora's website)"
3,First two hours are AWFUL!,"After reading all of the wonderful reviews I decided to try this while at Ulta. What really struck me was the plasticky smell that hung around for a good two hours. I think I am also allergic because I got a pretty bad headache. My 10 year old son, my husband and mother-in-law and I all thought it smelled pretty awful. Maybe we just have different tastes. After a bit of time, what was left was a soft cotton candy type smell. Okay smelling when it finally died down, but for obvious reasons, I won't be purchasing pink sugar."
3,A Little Strong,"Although this does smell sweet, it's a little too sweet and strong. The smell is better suited for a young girl so I gave it to my 10 year old daughter with the instructions to spritz in the air and do a walk through so she wouldn't smell too strong.It gave me a headache every time I used it."
2,Dissapointed- over time?,"Alright so I bought this a perfume a year and a half ago, I LOVED it at first. I used almost a whole bottle! Then I bought another one and switched up my pefume for a while. I went back to the old bottle and sprayed it and it smelled really funky, I don't know why but both of them smell funny after they sit for a while-they don't smell like the bottles in the store. It's like it goes bad after a while? So wtf?"
1,DID NOT RECEIVE ORDER,"I ordered this on the 8th of June! I was supposed to receive it today, but I did not get anything. :( I want a refund!"
1,I almost gagged myself when I wore this,"Too strong, too sweet, smells cheap. Avoid this at all costs"
5,Smells delicious all day,"I agree, this product is worth trying. It was so delicious that my dogs tore into it when someone left my bag of goodies out. This was one item I had to replace. A little bit goes a long way and lasts all day. It's a ""feel good"" smell."
4,Pink Sugar,"I love love love this scent. I first went through a 1 oz bottle, wanted more, then bought the 3.4 oz size. I still really love the fragrance, but it lasts all of 20 seconds. I literally can spray my entire room, all my bedding and pillows, my clothes and head, spray some into my air conditioner, heater, whatever, then walk away, and come back into my room a minute later and not smell it at all. I feel like maybe the smaller size bottle was more potent, but I could just be imagining it. If they could create a longer-lasting perfume version I would be hooked for life. p.s. the bottle is very pretty..the shiny pink swirly is nice and I like that it's a simple shape and isnt covered in big cheesy flowers or something."
5,Oh La La Love it!,"I get so many compliments on this scent. I hate to even tell people what it is because I like how unique it is on me! I hope this product is never discontinued because I love it. It is the perfect mix of soft, pleasant scents without all the floral scents and though others may disagree, I don't think it's youthful at all. What woman wouldn't want to smell edibile yet sophisticated at the same time? Then again, what do I know. =)"
4,If you like Cotton Candy......,"If you love the scent of COTTON CANDY, you will love this. It really does smell like Pink Sugar with a touch of vanilla.I put on a sample secretly and then walked around the house when company was over, just to see what kind of reaction I would get.Two people immediately said"" What smells like Cotton Candy?""People have told me it is a happy,sweet smell- not gaggy. They said it has a softness to it- not overpowering at all.Then again- watch how you apply this. Overkill of any scent can turn people off.I would give it 5 stars if the staying power was a bit stronger.You can smell this through out the day, it just gets more muted as the day wears on. This is a terrific perfume for a reasonable price. Not everyone can pay 80.00 and up for an ounce."
4,Great smell,"This product is great it gives the hair a great yummy smell while also providing a hint of shine to it! I just wish the smell would last a little longer within the hair, but will definetly recommend it."
5,Sweet kisses of sugar.....,"Yeah, it's kissable on your neck...compliments of my boyfriend....ha-ha-ha!!!He's sold!!Me tooooo!!!I think this perfume smells delicious!!!The scent lingers once you spray, last long on the skin. Smells like to me: a bit of burnt sugar--in a good way, like caramel, a hint of cotton candy and some raspberry scent tones in it. This is the reason why I wanted to try it out so I bought it and I am happy I did.:)"
1,not the same packaging,I wanted the package with the pepper on it like shown in the picture. When it came it was the one without the pepper. Its at The Rack for the same price.
5,Good price,Love this sent. Good price. Smells like cotton candy. One of my favorites of all time fragrance. Hard to find in stores
4,"Great smell, great value.","Very good value for the money. Smells great and last most of the day.Would recommend to others. For the amount and quality, this is a very good value compared to similar items on the market."
3,Doesnt last,"Love the smell, but it doesn't last. A little frustrating to have to carry the bottle along with me and re-spritz halfway through the day."
5,delicious smells,"I bought this for my wife after smelling it on a friends wife. It's just a wonderful fragrance! My wife still smells of pink sugar when she gets home after work, so it does last quite a while. Buy it for your wife, you won't be sorry."
2,Disappointed,"I was really excited for this product, but it does not smell as nice as the regular perfume. Fragrance doesn't last long and the smell seems a ""little off."" Better just to spritz a little of the regular perfume on your hair as you do out the door!"
2,Pink Sugar hair fragrance,I spray this on my hair as soon as I am done styling. It's smell last about a total of :30 seconds. It's a total waste. You are better off spraying your perfume on your hair instead. You might get drying alcohol doing it that way but that's apparently the only way to get the fragrance to last on your hair.
5,Love Love Love!,I love this perfume! I don't wear perfume a lot because I tend to get headaches from them or I just can't stand a strong floral smell. This perfume is sweet but not too sweet and kind of reminds me of cotton candy spray I used to wear in grammer school. I love that the smell lasts and doesn't fade away after an hour of applying. I have gotten many compliments on it from women but actually seemed to receive more from men...this will definately be a keeper! :)
5,STOP WORRYING,"I am a Perfume Enthusiast, i collect perfumes. I read all the bad reviews about how its fake, or its generic. I was Skeptical as it was being shipped to my house hoping i didnt get ripped off. But im happy to say, Its completely authentic ! the smell is exactly on point to the original. To all of those that says it smells different. Very fast shipping also! Yay Pink Sugar!"
3,Smells yummy but does not last..,"I was pretty skeptical about this product initially.. But I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I sprayed it in my hair. Smells sweet and clean. Boyfriend immediately noticed it. I have coarse, relaxed hair and did not experience what other reviewers were saying about it weighing down the hair or making it greasy. I also find the scent quite light and not overpowering. My only complaint is that it does not really last long enough. I mainly use it to spray after a flat iron session to eliminate any burn smell. I would recommend this product but think the price should be less!"
1,Misleading!,Nowhere in the description does it say the perfume is a tester without a box or without a top for the bottle. I bought this for a gift! If I had known this I would have bought it elsewhere. I don't understand why the seller didn't disclose this in the description.
4,Really Does Train Your Pet,"Great easy to use product - it does actually train the pet.Now when I leave the house, I don't even need to turn on the device, I just set it one the sofas and off I go."
4,Excellent if your pet doesn't like loud beeps,"This works well if your pet doesn't like loud beeps. Our dog has no fears - except for loud beeps (testing the smoke detector sends him running for the door, and even a kitchen timer beep scares him). He had figured out how to open a gate at the top of the stairs, so we attached a Tattle Tale to the gate. He no longer touches the gate or tries to go upstairs. So it works well for us.I wish the product would take 2-3 seconds before activating the beep when nudged, so you could turn it off without it beeping. (This isn't good for training - it beeps when we turn it off, and he did nothing wrong, so it confuses him). We usually now let the dog outside before turning it off, which is bit of a pain.Still, I he won't go near the gate or sneak upstairs at all any more, so it has done its job."
1,Did nothing while cat lay by and purred,"What a waste! Glad I can return it. I put it on my bed to keep the cats off, and it didn't work at all. Both cats jumped up onto the bed numerous times and then lay down by it with not a peep from the alarm."
1,What a crock....,"I was really hoping to find a suitable solution to keeping our new Bulldog off of our couch. We have been using unsightly barstools or aluminium foil (both very effective) while waiting for the Tattle Tale to arrive. After I set it on the couch, the Bullies ran to the couch to see what I was up to. When the not so loud alarm went off (set to ""Hi""), they both jumped up on the couch to get it, and one of them ran away with it in her mouth to try and destroy it! NOT so effective..."
1,Useless,"Waste of Money. Our cats jumped on the bench, the alarm went off, they just played with the device. They did this twice, didn't make any difference to them walking on the benchtops. I have thrown it away"
5,Great dog furniture preventive,"This is my second Tattle Tale. We have 4 German Sheppards, and they are effectively discouraged from jumping on that furniture which has the alarm. Good product."
1,Crap,"This is advertised as a pet training alarm- not an ""oh yeah and an intruder alarm too""- so I will treat it as such. First off, as I suspected, it is ""sonic"" meaning audible- not ultra-sonic meaning super high pitch that only the animals can hear. This was to stop two cats from climbing my Christmas tree btw. It does go off when they climb it- but all it does is bother me with an annoying tone. The cats don't even notice it. One is very skiddish and the ultra-sonic remote trainers make her jump and run, and at least gets the others attention- so they are manageable animals. I also have to shut it off at bedtime, because all it does is wake me up, and not deter the cats. This product is just a complete fail- if they had an ultra-sonic version- it would probably be great- effective on the animal, and not bother me every time it goes off."
5,It works!,I have a nervous Chihuahua mix that favors under the dinning room table to do her business now and then. I have cleaned the area with chemicals but she sneaks back to it. The Tattle Tale was reasonally priced so I thought I would try it. Thank goodness it worked! No more accidents. It has a low and high setting but works best on low since it detects any vibration. The short series of beeps are not too loud or ear piercing but enough to scare the pet away. I bought a second one to keep my mid size dog away from the trash can. No more trash on the kitchen floor!
5,Definitely does the job!,"Our Jack Russell and Doberman are great about staying off the furniture, until we walk out the door. This alarm is very sensitive, responds quickly to movement, and my dogs hate it! No more hair or claw marks on the couch - as long as I remember to turn them on :)!"
2,Didn't scare our puppy,"We purchased two of these for two doggie gates we were using for our puppy. The noise is fairly loud and managed to scare me a couple of times, but she was less than impressed by it. She would put her paws on the gate and set off the alarm; however, the noise would only make her cock her head in interest (while keeping her paws on the gate). I believe it entirely depends on the personality of the dog. She is not highly strung, so she doesn't scare easily. Keep your dog's personality in mind before purchasing this so that you don't spend $50 needlessly like we did."
2,Cat Toy?,We purchased 2 of these to keep our 2 cats from climbing on the back of our couch then on to destroying the drapes behind it. They just love these things and if they could talk would probably thank us for the new toys. They are not the least bit afraid and even the high setting just seems to attract them.Tattle Tale Sonic Pet Training AlarmWe really feel they are not worth the price.
3,Not so great! for me that is,"Ok I got this because my younger cat has been naughty over the last few weeks! I bought based on the reviews and yes it worked, for 3 days!! Soon after he got used to it. I couldn't believe that he just walk right passed it beeping for over 20 secs. I've giving it a 3 star rating because it did work, just not long enough. May be it works best only in tandem with the mat or they need a louder alarm to really freak him out. Wanted this to work so badly, but looks like my cat got the better of me. I'm going to buy the Contech Stayaway. Definitely returning the 3 units that I bought!"
3,Not the right solution for our problem,"The alarm sounds when the surface it is on shakes or vibrates. So it will not work on a countertop, because a countertop does not shake or vibrate when a cat jumps on it. It has 2 different settings for sensitivity. We put ours on the dining room table. Initially the cats were scared of it. However, we accidentally triggered it so many times that they became desensitized to the sound. Closing a cabinet door too hard, a loud sneeze, etc., would cause it to go off. And it did not always go off when they jumped on the table.I think this is a flaw any brand of this type of product would have. It would probably work best on a table in a room that nobody uses or is near except at mealtimes."
1,Not for my cat!!,"Now, I have a 15 lb. cat --- no light weight. And I also have a lovely new modern vinyl couch. Day one --- claws in couch. He seems to like all the ""off"" sprays. Soaked the couch in them. So I tried this. Never even went off (except when I touch it.) So I guess, if your cat is able to leap on an item without wiggling it, the gadget is useless. Drat!"
2,The cat's in control,"I wanted this to keep my cats off the bed when I wasn't home. Well, it doesn't work. Today I saw the cat laying right beside the thing and it was set to loud. Moreover, he's a bit cat --- weighs 11 lbs. If he doesn't make the bed move at least a bit when he jumps on it, I don't know what does.The unit may work in some circumstances and in some places. But the bed isn't one of them. At least not mine. I tested the unit and it does work. I put it on the bed and hit the bed or got on it myself and it went off. But the cat can get on it without incident.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson"
4,Good at scaring away the cats!,"I bought two of the tattle tales to place on both my kitchen table and the formal dining table to help keep my cats away. For some reason I can buy them the most comfy pet bed ever but they insist that the hard wood tables are more comfortable.After just a few days of use the cats learned not to go near the tables, but being cats they are smarter than most and I think they actually notice when I move the tattle tales and forget to put it back on the tables. I can tell because the next morning I'll find cat hair near the scene of the crime. You'll want to either move or turn off the units when using whatever furniture you've placed them on because otherwise they will just keeping beeping at you everytime you move near them. ;) Just remember to put them back!We're having a new couch delivered this week and hoping to use the tattle tale on there as well."
2,My cats ignored it after the first buzzer,"Trying to return this item, waiting for the seller to give me instructions. The first time it went off it scared my cats but after that they ignored it."
2,doesn't work very well,"the alarm tone is too soft and did not affect my curious kitty. at best, it just lets us know when she is on the kitchen counter. does not keep her off though."
5,Great product,Bought this for my cat and dog that kept jumping on my living room sofas. First bought a pair then ordered 4 more after seeing the first pair work on one sofa. Pets don't like the shrieking sound and solved my problem. Would recommend this product.
2,waste of money,i bought this at the recommendation of my dog trainer. it never goes off when my dog approaches it but instead screams when the kiddos go running by.....
2,did not work,I bought this item to prevent my cat from going on the rug and do her business. She had already done it before the alarm went off. It did go off however when my husband walked in the next room.I solved the problem though: I got rid of the rug...
3,"It works, but...","We bought two of these to keep our boxer off the counters & the furniture. We have a problem that when our birds chirp, it sets off the alarms. The alarms set off the birds, and over & over... The training alarm does work, but we found that our dog would carry them outside through the dog door and leave them outside. We caught him in the act of trying to bury it while the alarm kept resetting itself. It was pretty funny. It didn't work for us, but I think it would for a dog that doesn't like loud noises. Doesn't seem to affect ours though."
1,"Repels people, not cats","Well, this does what it says, in that it emits a loud annoying noise. But it doesn't work very well - it is TOO sensitive on the ultra-sensitive setting. Couldn't take a step in the house without setting it off. But on the less sensitive setting, it sometimes worked, sometimes didn't. As a result, within a few days, our cats were completely immune to it. Once I heard it go off and looked around, only to find that my cat was actually laying on it! Didn't faze him a bit! So, I cannot recommend. We bought ours from another company and paid more (sadly) than it's listed here now. Can't return - it was a total waste of money!"
2,Doesn't Work on Kitty Monsters,"I can see how this product might work for some cats, but it didn't even phase ours. Just when we think we've hit on something that might be effective for our 3 1/2 year old Maine Coon, she proves us wrong! The only beings in the house annoyed by the sonic blast were the humans - had to send it back."
4,Goes off when I close the front door.,I have a new dog living in the house and she likes to get on the couch when I'm not home. My neighbor had a couple of these units so I bought two myself. I think they work (I'm not home but find the dog in her bed when I return). They are very sensitive and go off when I swing the front door closed downstairs or if I jump on the floor.
2,False information,"In the description of this product it states that you can adjust the vibration of the unit. I wasn't aware that there are two different types of this product. The regular sonic one you have to activate the other is a vibration unit that you can adjust the vibration and leave the unit in the area to keep the animal away. I had bought this thinking it was the vibrating unit due to the description. I was going to go away for Christmas and wanted something to monitor our cat when he got too close to the Christmas tree. When the unit arrived, I checked the Amazon website again and then noticed there are two different units. I never picked up on it when I ordered. Bottom line, the description for the regular sonic unit is wrong and needs to be corrected. You are not able to adjust the vibration unit and leave it unattended. It's not worth for me to return this one for the other since I will be leaving in a few days for my trip. I'm really disappointed and annoyed that I was mislead."
2,Hardly Works,"We ordered this item to stop our cat from getting in the Christmas tree durring the holidays then to keep him off the counters after the holidays. The cat could jump in the tree, jump on presents surrounding and under the device and jump on the counter directly next to the device, and it wouldnt go off. It only went off once or twice when the cat actualy batted the device around a few times and knocked it down. Not worth the money."
5,Perfect to keep pets off furniture,I bought this to keep my dog off the outdoor furniture. It works great. The dog has not been on the furniture at all. I think she stopped trying because of the loud beep she hears when she gets close!
5,Keeps them of the couch,My cats enjoyed sharpening their nails on my couch until I put these things on it. The alarms are very sensitive and will even alarm if you are too loud near it(the sensitivity is a good thing because even the slightest touch of a paw will set them off). Great way to keep the kitties off the furniture.
3,Very loud,"This seemed to work for about a day. It was aggravating because even if you slammed the door the alarm went off. The training alarm was on the kitchen island. Also, I believe my dog out smarted it a few times. But there were times when he ran from it. I wouldn't buy it again for a dog who is 60 lbs and can put his paws on the counter easily."
4,Certainly loud enough,Works well with the pets and is loud enough. The dog(18 mos.) will not go near it and that's good because he will eat anything.
4,Do Tell!,"This product worked great with my 35 pound some-kinda-dog. For an outdoor boundary we have the Petsafe Wireless invisable fence, so our dog responds quickly to the beep.PROS: It's easy to put in place. It is small to store. We can put it on furniture, counters or the edge of a stair. It is very quick to respond.CONS: The decibel level! This thing could wake King Tut. Movement is made when it is turned on/off, so we set it while our dog is outside. When placing it we have to remember it is activated by the device moving, not by movement nearby. This means a very slight movement from a light paw on the sofa. For it to work on counters the pet must actually touch it or cause a vibration. (Try putting a piece of kibble in front of it or laying the device on a sheet of paper, which might be slid a little.)There is another product called Scraminal that has a motion sensor, and detects noise and heat across a 3 X 10 foot area, but the Tattle Tale is better for the areas we need it."
1,Tattle Tale Sonic Pet Training Alarm,The device was set to high and placed on a counter in the kitchen. The cat jumped up on the counter and sniffed the device. The unit is worthless.
2,tattle tale sonic pet training alarm,"don't like it , I don't know if I will use it there should be a range ajustment on it"
2,Tattle Tale Pet Alarm,"The Tattle Tale Sonic Pet Alarm does not work as I had expected it to. It ""goes off"" at unexpected times and does not go off when kitty is near. In fact, she looks at it and puts her pay on it!.I'm just so disappointed as I purchased 2 and they're in a drawer. Guess I just threw my dollars away."
3,Still Worth It,Not as much fun as the other Palliser novels. But there is a good trial scene - good details about the court system of the time. I think there is one more novel in this series to go.
5,Black & Decker String Trimmer Replacement,"The Black & decker Replacement Spool works great,when you run out of weed eater string just use these,no winding,just use this and finish the job.Works Great !!"
4,Black and Decker String Trimmer is light and easy to use,The trimmer is very light and easy to use. It always starts and no need of pulling. The only set back is the life of the battery. Make sure at least two batteries are fully charged. Do trimming of heavy stuff such as edge trimming while the battery has enough juice. The rest of weeds trimming does not take much power to do it. Over all I am satisfied with the trimmer.
4,"Works fine, but expensive...","Never had a problem with these, but they are way too expensive. $7 something a piece at the big box stores... $18 I think for a 3 pack... close to that here... I've not had much luck with hand wound spools... so I just keep forking over $$ for the convenience. argh."
2,Don't waste your money,"What the other reviewers fail to mention, maybe because they failed to try, is that the AFS on the trimmer continues to work flawlessly with hand wound string, and at less than 1/4 the cost it's seems like a huge waste to buy the pre-wound spools. It only takes 2 minutes to rewind a spool, so even when I do run out in the middle of a job, I just look at it as a 2-minute break from yard work. Of course, if your one and only concern is convenience, you may be looking at the right product. Be aware, if you've had trouble with rewinding trimmers in the past, it may be because you're using old line, which tends to get brittle over time. Buy some new line and try again. If you buy the three-pack of spools three times, you just paid for your trimmer again.Thanks for reading,Adamps. Two stars for effort, but the cost is just ridiculous."
4,Nice replacements,"A little high priced, but nice to have three spare spools. Now, I'll just buy string and respool myself, much cheaper."
4,String trimmer review,"Product works as advertised. The only minor problem is taking the tape off of it when I need it. Since I usually need it when I am outside and sweaty, it is sometimes difficult."
5,Excellence!,I purchased my cordless Black and Decker weeder and also purchased the 3 spool pack of replacement string for it. I am happy with my Black & Decker Cordless Auto Feed weeder and also the 3 spool pack of replacement trim line that I purchased at the same time. Having a chain link fence enclosing our back yard I am free to take the Black & Decker cordless weeder where ever I want without having the hassle of getting any cords over the fence and also finding a plug in. It is great and the Replacement Spools will be handy.
4,Large lot with the Black and Decker String Trimmer,I have a 1 1/2 acre lot. It has worked great. I would recommend getting one extra battery (2 come with it) for a lot size over 1 acre. It is great not dealing with starting a gas trimmer or a cord with an electric trimmer. It has done pretty well in the thicker areas....not as good as a gas trimmer but good enough.
2,Dont need this one. Get loose cord and spool it up yourself,Spending 15 plus bucks on this is not worth it. You could instead get the nylon cord at homedepot or lowes and roll it up yourself.People have tried it with various levels of success/failure but it does work for sure.
1,garbage,"don't buy into any of these reviews. the replacement string jams EVERY TIME you replace the roll. EVERY TIME. No exceptions. Let no one tell you differently. 3 minutes into a roll, and the string is unraveled in the casement. You take the roll out, re-wrap it, jams again. I've easily spent 50% more than I should have on replacement string because I have to throw away the jammed ones and start anew."
3,Spare Me A Review,"Bought a B&D; cordless trimmer and while I have no trouble rewinding a string trimmer spool by hand, thought this was cheap enough to have sitting in the garage to avoid the chore.So far, I've had really good life from the original spool in the trimmer, so haven't even needed to go into the spares yet. If the replacements work as well as what came in the trimmer (and it should be the same stuff right?) I don't know if I'll ever have to buy more of these!"
3,Rewind assistent,"Being 'righthanded' with two left hands I have great difficulty to evenly rewind the spool. I am sure the R&D; dept. of B&D; is capable of developing something to make this 'task' easier, faster and do it better.Just wondering why they don't. Anyone out there to second a motion?"
2,Incorrect product for edger,Incorrect item. The spools were supposed to be the double stringed ones for a newer grass hog edger.
2,Black & Decker cordless weedwacker,"It seems kind of chinzy for $100, I doubt it will last very long. It does an OK job on the light weeds. The battery doesn't last very long, so it is a good thing it came with 2. They take a long time to charge."
4,Very Convenient but More Affordable Options are Available,"I've been using my Grasshog for nearly eight years now and replacing these spools has always been fast and easy, but read some other reviews and you'll find, as I have, there are more affordable options out there if you're willing to do some work yourself."
5,Spools for weedwacker,My hubby was going crazy looking for the spools to his weekwacker. It seems like they change them each year so you have to purchase a different one. We went on Amazon.com and found exactly what wewanted and purchased them. We are very please and will come back when we need more. Thanks Amazon!Geri
5,black and decker trimmer spools,These spools make it a snap to change the trimmer line and at $5.00 each in 3packs. I stock up for summer season. It beats winding your own line back on empty spools no tangled mess thanks amazon
4,string trimmer line just a bit pricey,"This is the second order that I've placed for this product. Its very easy to load into the trimmer, and cuts grass and high and tough weeds easily. But, for what it is, a simple plastic spool and 30 feet of trim line, which i would think is pretty cheap to manufacture, it seems to me a bit expensive. And I should mention that Amazon's price was a 'sale' price as well."
5,best buy out there,Top rate buy! Saved $6.00 off price they sell at Home Depot. I bought two packs so I got free shipping too>
3,fantastic the first time - terrible the second,"This was my first review: I'm disabled so I really appreciate it when I can avoid a trip to the local hardware store. This string for my trimmer works great! Thanks, Amazon.OOPS! Got to change my review because the last two spools I tried to use were not wound on the spool correctly and the line kept getting stuck while I was trying to use it today. SO DISAPPOINTED because the first order was great - no problems!"
2,Replacement Spool,I'm not very happy with this product. The way the line is wound around the spool for some reason it will not advance automatically. I have to continuously remove the spool cover and physically advance the line by hand.
2,Sub Par,These refills were poorly wound and constantly had to be manually unwound in order to use them. A huge hassle
5,Inexpensive replacement line.,"This is OEM replacement line for my B&D; cordless string trimmer.It fits, works well, and is High quality.Lowes was at least twice the price, But, you still get to stand in line."
4,Black & Decker replacement spools,Easy to replace. So far so good. The 18V trimmer is everything I expected.The line lasts along time if you just have edging to do around your yard that is just grass.
5,Almost as Good as Sliced Bread,"For years, I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool. What a fiasco! Once the factory-wound spool ran out, the line never again fed properly. No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding, the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up. I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass. Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these. They're a godsend. Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool, but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you, disposable spools are the way to go. (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)"
2,Bad Timing,"I purchased this to be used with a Black & Decker string trimmer only to have it die before I could use. Unfortunately, the spools are an 1/8"" too thick to work on my Weedeater. One consolation is that I can unwind the string and rewind on the weeder eater spool. This is time consuming, but at least I have been able to use the sting."
3,Could be better...,I noticed that the spool that came with the trimmer lasted longer than the replacemnet spools. I trimmed my lawn four times with the first spool. The replacement spool only lasted two times. They need to sell a thicker line.
3,It's okay if you're lazy!,"It's great to use this item if you are just too lazy to spend 2 minutes to wrap the spool yourself. I went to Lowe's and bought the generic industrial strength spool for 1/3 the price of these, and it lasted a long time.Yeah, I had to spool it myself, but I would rather save the money so I can buy more industrial gauge spool, instead of wasting money on these things."
4,"Easy to use, don't last long","I agree with other reviewers. The trimmer works great, is light and the easiest to use trimmer I have ever used. The spools are easy to use once you get the packaging tape off of the which can be a real hassle. The spools do not last long. I went through the first one in 3 weeks. I have a medium size yard.Why bother rewinding the spools. The replacements are so cheap."
2,got really sticky,"This is the first time I have purchased these replacement spools not at Home Depot or Menards,and I tell you, this will be the last! Each spool seems to be all sticky and do not advance as they should. I am constantly taking the trimmer apart to unravel the spool, then it gets stuck again. When I try to go it manually, the string seems to stick together. They were in B & D packaging, but they seem to be a generic replacement or something."
4,Black and Decker Trimmer,I have used my new trimmer a few times and am very happy with it. I have 2 batteries and can get all my trimming done at one time. It's not as heavy as a gas-powered trimmer and I appreciate that aspect.
4,"Slow, Slow, Slow shipping","I've used this product before when I took the trip to Home Depot and was using it that day. The spools work fine. I thought I would save a couple of bucks in gas and order it online. What a mistake. I ordered it on 6/23/11 and today is 6/28/11 and it still hasen't shipped! TALK ABOUT HORRIBLE SERVICE! I'm not sure if it's AMAZON or the dealer/seller, but this is just stupid and a great way to loose customers."
5,Black and Decker AF-100-3ZP 30 ft. .065 in Line String replacement,Product is just like I expected. Shipped in brown box. I ordered two sets and they came just as I wanted. Perfection.
5,It's very Good!,"I've read this book occasionally and found it really fascinating. As a sociological analysis of tourism, the author successfully applies modern social theories to offer readers alternative perspectives. Obviously, Prof. Wang is familiar with works of Bourdieu, Baudrillard and so on, so that he can jump in and out postmodern theories freely and wonderfully shows the complex relationship between tourism and modernity. The book has been translated into Korean recently, but not yet into Chinese, which I think is really a pity for readers in the motherland of this author."
2,Just OK,It's OK. Certainly not as good as what you'd get in a restaurant. I thought it was kind of expensive for the portion and quality.
5,Very pleased!,"We switched from a soft spout nubby and my son took to this right away! I am very happy that it A) does not leak, one bit and B) it is dish washer safe! My son loves lightening and I got what I wanted out of a silly, double win:)"
2,"Big bottle, tiny mouth",They look good but my boy hates them. He would rather drink his milk from a glass than use this cup. I dont know what the real problem is but i feel the bottle is huge compared to its mouth.....
3,Not as good as the first season,"I was disappointed with this season in comparison with the first; it lacked the same wit and energy. In particular, many of the skits seemed short and choppy, as if they couldn't maintain momentum with an idea as well as they did the first time. Perhaps the difference was in the editting and not the performance? I bought the first season but not the second, especially given the much higher price. I hope the third season is more like the first.FIVE years later. . .The first season was the best. This show lost it's mojo. It's like a leaky balloon. . .each season was worse than the one before. On the positive side, NO season was worse than the movie; the movie suk'd."
3,THAN BUY YO,"IF YOU LIKE IT YO THAN BUY IT, Nah this is hilarious I just dont like prejeduce people like you know, YO THIS IS KEWL DAWG!!!!!!!!!"
3,going downhill,"I'm really surprised to see so many glowing reviews here. I loved Season 1, but thought Season 2 jumped the shark. The first epsiode was fine, particularly the night out at the end. I think they focused too much on stories rather than scenes.For example: The episode with Constable Smiley was basically one joke--the innocent-seeming British cop brutalizing Reno. The first scene with him worked because of the surprise, but from there the joke was dead."
2,Don't always believe the high star ratings on a book,"I had read the previous reviews believing their praises & thought that this would be a nice book for inspiration for my own art. If I had been able to see more pictures from this books BEFORE I bought it, I don't think that I would have bought it. There are too many blurred and/or DARK images that you can't even tell what they are & what's with the skinned frogs positioned like they are having carnal knowledge?! 2 pages were wasted on the poor frogs! Nude frogs?! Also what's with the 3 nude Barbies? I thought this was supposed to be a book on human nudes. Whatever! There were some nice artsy images but I am put off by the women trying to pull their nipples off (even my husband thought that was weird). I guess if you want something alittle strange, here's your book (and I am not a prude by far)."
2,"Title is misleading, and book is poorly written","I was disappointed for two reasons: this is not a textbook of ""packages that sell""--it's an exhibit of interesting and edgy packaging that may or may not ""sell"". My biggest problem with the book was that the text was VERY hard to read because there was no punctuation! It's amazing what commas can do, and I finally gave up trying to read and reread passages that had no punctuation except a period now and then. And I guess I was expecting to learn some of the basic and almost subliminal techniques of packaging that break through the clutter and sell a product. I pretty much flipped through the book in less than 1/2 hour and haven't picked it up since."
1,bad Ni Cads........,"great lil saw BUT Milwaukee 18 V NiCads suck!!! buy this bare bones and add Lith Ions, u will be happier......."
5,Great sound quality!,"This CD presents excellent live performances with much better sound quality than the King Biscuit/Royal Albert Hall concerts, which are marred by an annoying buzzing sound."
2,The 28th Ingredient is Missing,"I ordered this book before I knew that it was a Eugenia Potter mystery, based on the characters created by Virginia Rich. I always considered Rich's mysteries ""lightweight."" They are lacking in plot and suspense. Ms. Pickard religiously recreates these flaws.The phrase, ""Where's the beef?"" for this chili comes to mind. If you want to read a nice romance between Eugenia and a former college sweetheart, then this book is for you. If you want a challenging mystery, look somewhere else. The dead body was found way too late and I guessed who done it way too soon.With respect to the recipes, Diane Mott Davidson's series of Goldy of Goldilock's catering provides more and better ones, some of which I have tried and liked."
5,Lovely Anklet,"I bought this silver anklet, It looks really great! It's a lovely anklet...100% Satisfied"
3,HEAVY BLUES,"MICHAEL SOUNDS UNREHEARSED. GARY BARDEN SOUNDS DRUNK. ROCK YOU TO THE GROUND WITH GARY BARDEN ON VOCALS AND A HEAVY METAL VERSION OF BIJOU PLEASURETE MAKE THIS CD WORTH BUYING, IF YOU ARE AN MSG COLLECTOR. OTHERWISE KEEP LISTENING TO STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT, BUDOKAN AND THE UNFORGIVEN WORLD TOUR LIVE CD."
1,"Handle ONLY, no auger","Don't be misled by the picture, the write-up or the reviews. This is for the handle ONLY. It's a quality wooden handle, and I am sure it would fit the referenced auger. The name ""Seymour"" is painted on the handle in blue. There isn't a lot that can be said about an auger handle: if you need one and think $50-plus and shipping is a fair price to pay, go for it."
4,Auger Works Great,The auger was easy to use. I was able to dig a 40+ inch hole in around 10 minutes. Most was clay with a few small rocks. I did encounter a larger rock (around candy bar size) that I needed to dig out with a pick. But other than that it worked great.
5,Easy 3 foot holes,"I bought this auger to dig post holes for my backyard vineyard trellis. I needed 3 1/2 foot deep holes for 6 inch diameter end posts and 3 foot holes for 5 inch diameter middle posts. The adjustable feature of this auger made it easy to set different hole sizes, and the bolt that holds the setting is very sturdy.The auger is extremely easy to use. I was able to dig a 3 1/2 foot deep hole, 7 inches in diameter, in less than 15 minutes. Granted I didn't have any roots or rocks to worry about - which would have slowed things up. But as long as you're working in fairly root and rock free dirt, you'll breeze through it.Looking for an easy and cheap way to dig holes, don't use a clamshell - use this!"
5,Works like a charm,"I used this product to dig several 2'6"" fence post holes, and it worked great. I tried using the clam shell diggers at first, and then gave these a try after making no progress.As other reviewers have mentioned rocks and roots will give you issues.It seems to work best if you get it started 2"" to 3"" deep with the clam shell diggers, and then you can pretty much drill straight down with this tool.I would highly recommend."
5,Great post hole digger,"I borrowed one of these from a friend to dig the holes for my deck. It worked great! I was trying to use one of those traditional post hole diggers that you jab into the ground but seeing that the ground is all clay, that particular type of digger didn't work at all. The auger type went right though the clay. Made my job much much easier!"
4,Always been a good product,"Smaller than I realized, but unless you build machines often (I don't any more) it's more than enough for your needs."
5,For PS3 YLOD fix.,When I fixed the PS3 YLOD (Yellow Light of Death) problem I used this thermal compound to replace the old thermal compound in the PS3 (it was recommended by a bunch of YouTubers) and it did what it was supposed to do. Now my PS3 runs fine.
5,good things in small packages,"Probably the best thermal compound out there. How do I know? Using this thermal paste [after using the one that came with my hyper 212) dropped my idle temps from 36c to 32c and my max load temps from 50c to 48c. This tube will probably last you until you decide to upgrade your computer (2-3 years). That is, of course, unless you are OCD about your desktop and must clean it out every week. I typically clean mine out every month or two and reapply the paste every 3 or 4 months."
5,Quality product as always,"I'd call this the ""nerd's choice"" in thermal paste.I've been using it for years and its always great.It's kind of expensive for how much you get (amazon is cheapest though) but it's definitely worth it.Word of advice, if you have a stock cooler on a brand new CPU that comes with the thermal paste already applied on it, I would just recommend leaving that alone and using the pre-determined amount of paste unless you know exactly how much to apply.Also, another note, this stuff sucks to get off anything so be real careful when applying it to not get it on any clothes (it doesn't come off)In summary, I'd definitely recommend this product if you know what you're doing. It can't be beat!"
5,Cooler running Intel Core2 Duo after using this Heat Sink Paste,"The Arctic Silver 5 seems to really make a good CPU to Heat Sink bond. I've noticed a cooler running laptop, with a slower CPU fan speed as a result of using the stuff."
3,Size Matters,"No I haven't tried Arctic Silver. I can't tell you how well it works. But I can tell you that the actual tube is half as big as I had expected. The total length is 2.5"" while the total tube is only 1.5"". That means that the plunger can only move an inch at most and probably less. That may be all you need. All I can say is that I was a little surprised."
3,Resultados cuestionables,"La aplicación sobre la superficie del procesador no es óptima, tiende a regarse y embadurnarse. Los resultados de la disipación similares a otras aplicaciones del mercado."
2,ARCTIC SILVER,THE PHOTO OF THE PRODUCT WAS THE SAME AS I HAVE PURCHASED FOR MAYBE 20 YEARS.WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS TINY. THERE WAS HARDLY ENOUGH GOO FOR ONE CPU.VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE PRESENTATION ON AMAZON. NO WARNING I WAS ORDERINGA SUBSTANDARD QUANTITY.
1,Waste of time and money - Skip It!,I would not recommend it to anyone. It's been a big disappointment.Did not perform any better than other cheaper compounds. Skip it!
5,works great for XBOX rrod repair,"I've used this stuff for several XBOX 360 repairs and it hasn't let me down yet. For the money it can't be beat, I am still on my first tube and have about half left. I recommend this to everyone I know!"
4,Great taste!,"These are great when you're in a hurry and have no time to eat. The calorie to protein ratio is great. I haven't seen too many protein shakes with such few calories. It also tastes great. I have tried the chocolate and the strawberry ones. I like the vanilla ones the best. My only issue with them is that they are a bit on the pricey side. Amazon by far has the best price. I used to buy them at Trader Joe's for 2.29 each. One other thing, you have to definitely shake them before you drink them. If you don't, you may sometimes get little bits of cornstarch. If you shake it too hard though, when you open it, it will get all over the place."
5,Cookies and Creme rocks!,"Cookies and Creme Pure Protein Shake by World Wide tastes just like a thin milkshake. It's delicious and creamy with no odd after-taste. It beats all the other flavors, hands down."
2,Shakes,I received three kinds of these shakes and for some reason the only one that had damage and busted cans were the cookies and creme...You could tell from the outside of the box it had busted cans but this product was sent anyway. The chocoloate and banana flavors were just fine so it was not a shipping issue. I do think I'll buy these from here again as I lost three cans.
1,horrible,"The ""vanilla cream"" tastes god-awful. Medicinal and chemically. And I bought a whole pack of 12. Ugh. Avoid."
4,Muscle Milk is better,"As compared to Muscle Milk Light, this product contains slightly thinner liquid (Muscle Milk Light is thicker) and it is a little on the sweet side. Overall, a very nice product but I still prefer Muscle Milk Light. Muscle Milk Light tastes better because it is not so sweet, and Muscle Milk Light seems to fulfill my hunger better, probably because it is a thicker liquid. These go down real easy, but for some reason I always find myself hungry after, and with Muscle Milk Light I seem to stay more full, longer. I also like regular Muscle Milk, but Muscle Milk Light is my personal favorite."
2,Doesn't taste good,"I purchased the Vanilla Shake on the recommendation and high ratings of the Amazon community, and I have to say I was let down for the first time. I did not enjoy the bland taste of this shake at all. I suppose if you like Slim Fast, this stuff is comparable but if you are looking for a tasty post workout RTD, stick with Labrada or Muscle Milk which are way way better tasting than this. It gets 2 stars for not upsetting my stomach."
1,Worst Protien Shake,I bought the vanilla creme flavor. It tastes very bad. I bought a four pack about 6 months ago and I hve tried to drink three so far and been unable to finish any of them because of the artificial sweetness being overwhelming. I was suprised that this would be so bad having many other brands of RTD shakes that are excellent.
1,Tastes horrible,"The frosty chocolate tastes very metallic. I would compare it to drinking aluminum foil in liquid form. Absolutely disgusting. If you need a good protein drink, try a scoop of Body Fortress protein powder with milk. It tases better and has fewer calories and more protein per serving.Body Fortress Whey Protein Powder - Chocolate (2 lb.)"
5,good protein drink,"I have been eating their bars for years and never knew about the drink until one day when I saw it at my gym. Since then, I've been hooked. It's a good post-workout drink that has everything you need for workout recovery, plus it tastes great. This option is great too, since you don't need a blender and can easily take it with you."
2,other flavors are better,This one is not my favorite. It kind of tasts like kaopectate. The banana and the chocolate are much better... but it is 35 grams of protein
1,Poor info,Be sure you want item!!!!! They won't prepay return label OR the personal cost to return to them . Buy local:)
1,One can TWICE A DAY FOR ME!!,"Having recently had gastric bypass surgery, I rely on these shakes twice a day to keep my protein levels up into the GREAT range!! I like the FROSTY CHOCOLATE shake the best (although I've also tried the Strawberry, Banana and Vanilla), and I pour them over some crushed ice (as I like my drinks ICY cold), and it's just delicious!! In the 89 days since my surgery, I guess I've drunk 180 CANS of this stuff! WHEW!! (but I've lost 53 pounds too!) I've tried LOTS of other protein mixes, and I just really like the chocolatly smoothness of this product AND the fact that it has almost TWICE AS MANY GRAMS OF PROTEIN as a drink you mix with the dry mix! There are 35 grams of protein in each 11 ounce can!! WOOHOO!!I give it FIVE STARS, and I reccommend it to everyone I meet!"
4,Great Product - Too Expensive Here!,"The product itself is wonderful; great taste, high protein, and low calories. But I buy individual cans at Trader Joe's for $2.29 each, whereas here it works out to $2.67 a can, plus shipping! Joe's also has the 21 gram versions for $1.99. So if you have a Trader Joe's close by, you can go and stock up while mixing and matching flavors and save lots of money."
4,Very Good High Protein Drink ... w/ low carbs,"This drink is about as good as it gets for high protein drinks. Fortunately, it is very low in sugar/carbs. Serve cold after intense workouts. It is not a meal replacement, but it is good after a workout."
5,Best Flavor of the 5,"I have tried all 5 flavors of this product, and Cookies and Cream is the best, with the least amount of aftertaste, though I don't think any of the flavors were bad."
3,Good Quality/Poor Taste,"I have tried many protein shakes, this is one is fairly good quality, however based on taste I give it a 2.5/5."
3,Reasonable option,"Pros: Very few carb caloriesReasonable taste (to me, the vanilla tastes like vanilla pudding)Packed with proteinCalories are almost all protein (good) caloriesCons: Contains whey protein (I have a mild allergy)ExpenseI keep some around to use if I've forgotten to bring my own protein shake powder for after a workout. It's nice to get all the protein without all the sugare."
2,Hard to Stomach by itself,"I usually get Vanilla flavours of protein since if they cant get the basic flavour down, then all the others will taste just as badThis was one of them, i could only drink it after blending with fruit to mask the taste of the product. The first time i tried it i just chugged it down but it left a bad after-taste."
4,Great starter train set,"This set was given to my son for Christmas, and I'd highly recommend it. My 3 year old needs some help putting the track together but it stays together well and has provided many hours of fun play for over a year. It's tough! We got some other trains and another train set this Christmas and they all work together very well. Even my 10 year old daughter has fun with this toy, too."
3,"The experiment worked pretty well, but seldom engaged me","Interesting. Certainly an unusual way to make a film and it works surprisingly well but, really, I wasn't all that engaged most of the time. The scenes from the play ""The Arbor"" performed in the park were pretty cool, though."
4,Good for landscape design solutions and ideas,"This is a beautifully photographed and well laid out book. It is somewhat repeative. However, the subject is focused and it is interesting to see how different sites were designed - or how the nuances varied to suit different sites.A good, but short, element specific reference guide follows the details of 11 sites. Most helpful is that the sites are in the general geographic and zone area in which I work.I am sure I will use it as a design reference."
5,Just what we were looking for,"Paul Bennett's book of Edmund Hollander Landscape design has been an important resource to us as we plan the renovation of our property. The diversity of designs presented from a variety of perspectives have given us a wealth of ideas. Most unusual is the quality of photographs which sadly, in most of the other landscape books we have looked at, don't seem to do their subject justice. The photographs alone make this book well worth the price."
5,Traditional board game fun!,Love this game! It's a great game for a group of friends or to get the family together.
5,great group or family game,We really enjoy playing this game. It is good for a wide range of ages and is a great mixer game.
5,The ultimate bluffing game,"I started playing Boulder Dash back in 1996 and since then it has become one of my favourite games. There is no limit to the number of players that can participate in the game. Actually the more that are playing the more fun it is. You DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW the meaning of the words to have fun. What you need is a wild imagination and good skills in bluffing. The game now includes more categories such as dates, initials and movie titles but still the word category I think is the best. If the cards that are provided in the box are finished no problem you can use scrap paper and honestly I have never used the board of the game while playing.Be ready for rounds of loud laughs and why not be ready to enrich your vocabulary with words you will never use anyway!"
4,Good party game,"This is a great game to play at parties or take on vacation. Many of these words might be too hard for children. But, for adults it is a lot of fun. The object is to come up with a definition of some obscure word in order to fool your opponents.I have A lot of fun with this game. I generally like to come up with some riddiculous answerfor example: One word was Throp- I gave the definition ""Something a 'thrabbit' does!""Many of the words are nouns. and many of the words are technical jargon of a specific field or profession.Its a good vocabulary biulder. Great practice for the game of scrabble."
3,Marginal sound quality,"Doubtless it is a miracle that these recordings even exist, that they survived, and that heaps of re-mastering technology has been lavished on them to make them (barely) listenable. But these really are quite difficult to get through. I would suggest that these are appropriate only for Parker completists or musicians / historians interested in studying every nuance of Parker's playing and comparing various live versions of his recordings. I am a pretty serious jazz fan, with ears hardened by years of listening through surface noise on historic recordings, and I found it difficult to listen to this more than once. I'm glad I have this on the shelf but it's not on my frequently played list."
5,collection of genius,"I bought this book after reading only one notebook entry, browsing in the bookstore aisle. I have never regreted the decision.It's a most fascinating and eclectic collection of thoughts and profound observations. I have never put the book down with the same vision as I picked it up."
5,Excellent collection!,This CD contains many of Anne Murray's very best and familiar songs. You will find yourself sigining or whisling along!
5,Brings back memories!,I didn't realize how much I missed listening to her music until I bought this! My husband and I used a couple of her songs at our wedding and enjoy the flood of happy memories that filled my mind when I hear them. A must buy for long-time Anne Murray fans!!
4,good product,overall a good cd kinda had songs on there that i didnt think should be and a particular song i thought should be wasnt on there
2,too long,I ordered and paid for a cd over a month ago for a special occassion. I was told the delivey date would be approx the 24th of June which was perfect for me as that would give me over a week to spare. The cd did not arrive as I expected and now when I checked up on my account they have altered the date to the 16th July. I am quite angry and disappointed as now I can not use the music for what I intended. Not happy JaneBest So Far
5,Song of Encouragement,"For those song birds out there, this CD's for you, it's got great hits to sing in the car whenever you're down, happy, etc.It was since I was a child growing up to listening to Anne Murray singing her hits on cassette, back in the 90's, now the 2000's to the year 08', now the device for Cds is blooming, the music that sound sweet to the ears of young and old, can enjoy The best..so far of Music legend, Anne Murray."
5,This is a Christmas gift for my younger brother.,"My younger brother once said Anne Murray was his favorite singer (he was about 5 at the time!) So, I got the idea to get him a CD of her music now that he's a grown man with a family of his own. I can't wait to see his reaction when he opens it! Hopefully he will still like her music, and not just appreciate the joke! Amazon always makes it easy to find just the right thing!"
4,Anne Murray The Best... So Far,I have no other country tapes but I just had to get this one. From Snowbird to Broken Hearted Me down to Over You is great. Anne Murray has a beautiful voice thats easy to listen to. Great purchase.
5,Anne Murray - Best...So Far,Very good CD. I've listened to it many times since receiving. It definitely is her best. Would recommend to any Anne Murray fan.
5,sensational - I grew up with her music,Wonderful snger - ugh - is deaf. Hope you see better than you hear.
3,Okay... just okay... but the kids will like it.,"Okay... same cast voices and a story that precedes and then runs concurrently with the original Lion King. It's not exactly a prequel or a sequel (maybe you could term this as a simuquel?). It's played more for laughs, giving a new perspective on many of the events we've seen before, like what actually motivated the animals' group bow as Rafiki presented the cub Simba atop Pride Rock.There is one inside joke after another, each one guaranteed to bring a smile to the face of adults and raucous laughter from the kids, but let's face it, this is a direct to DVD release. Compared to other ""direct to""s, it's superior. And it's arguably more fun than Treasure Planet for example. Pop it in the player and it will keep the little ones enthralled for an hour or so."
4,Very Good,"I thought the movie itself was good. Timon and Pumbaa tell the story of the lion king from their point of view. You can see how they met, what happened in timon's family, and other stuff before the story started. It even shows what happened afterwards. The DVD has a lot of cool features, like Who Wants to be King of the Jungle? Same thing as Who Wants to be a Millionaire? but you answer the questions. There are the lifelines and everything. Overall, this was not bad."
2,dude its twisted,This movie is the worst thing. Following up the last 2 movies. I loved the 1st but absolutely hated this one. It's toop silly and they try to hard to be funny.
4,Very Funny New music and new perspective on the story,I recently viewed this with my 5 year old and my 3 year old. We laughed and laughed. We were already quite familiar with the Lion King. (Family favorite) But my 5 year old was still singing the songs and retelling the jokes 2 weeks later.
5,Disney does it again......,"Oh my goodness. Lion King 1 1/2 is great. I love the Lion King movies & I laughed throughout this whole film. If you love Disney, & more importantly, if you love the Lion King, then this movie is a MUST have for your collection. It completes the ""saga"" that is the Lion King. Even if you don't have children (heck, borrow the neighbor's kids if you have to) I highly recommend this film. Perfect pick me up after a hard day at work."
4,"This movie is very funny, and should be in theateres!","I had doubt buying this movie, since most straight to video sequels of popular animation movies arn't theatere quality.(theyre too short, not original cast, TV quality animation, just not original). This movie defeats all odds! It has a good time length of 77 mins., and the animation is definitely movie theatere quality! The original cast is back (Mathew Broderick, Whoopie Goldberg, Nathan Lane, etc.) and it has a ton of funny references to the original. It's very original, and a lot of people are saying it should have been in theateres instead of Jungle Book 2 and so on. Go buy this movie NOW!"
3,The Lion King 1 1/2,"Although I enjoyed this movie very much, and laughed more than I've laughed in previous Lion King movies, I think this movie changes original events in The Lion King a tad to much. I dislike it when people take a good movie, and try to make a semi-comedy sequel of it. Even though this movie was meant to be comedy, I still think it could have been spared a few events that changed the original movie, such as ""the real reason the animals bowed to baby Simba"".I would recommend this movie to anyone, although I would say not to expect the same feelings you felt when you watched The Lion King.P.S. Please don't type mean comments about my review in your own. I've seen many people do that with other's revies, and I don't think it's very nice!"
3,Good Prodcut,"The Description say USED like new, but it was VERY NEW, i like the prodcut but the only thing is i expect a fast shipping, but its ok, im totally happy whit this seller"
4,The Lion King 1 1/2,"Having watched THE Lion King a countless number of times, 1 1/2, while filling in the gaps about the personalities Timon and Pumbaa, is not as fun to watch as THE Lion King. Set in a home movie house review format, with Timon and Pumbaa watching a re-view of their stints in The Lion King, the frequent interruptions via remote by either Timon or Pumbaa were rather irritating, to say the least.However, it is well worth the watch compared to The Lion King II."
4,Clever and Entertaining,"Of course no sequel will ever rival The Lion King, but this clearly isn't meant to. This movie is fresh and funny,(much better than The Lion King II Simba's Pride)and does give an interesting view of the story. It is a movie that children will love, (and any adult who has an inner child). People who think it is so terrible, what were you expecting? I loved it and I know my LK."
1,"RENT, DON'T BUY","What a waste of time and effort. Disney again hits a new low by regurgitaing one of its own ""classics"" to boost its DVD sales for the quarter, only this time it hypes a self-parody of ""The Lion King"" and diminishes it into a rolling mess of potty humor and weak plotlines. The premise, if there is one, is the retelling of the original story from the viewpoint of Timon and Pumbaa. It fails miserably. The continuity of the ""story"" is forceably broken at times by freezing the film and showing the silhouettes of Timon and Pumbaa in a movie theater (ala ""Mystery Science Theater""), fighting over the remote control, picking noses, flipping mucous, and generally whining obnoxiously over who had the best scene. My own five-year-old daughter lost interest twenty minutes into the movie, calling it ""stupid"". Don't waste your money on this over-priced mess. Rent instead, and turn it in quickly."
2,Nothing At All Like The Original,"Great score. Sweeping animated vistas. Great story line. All of this and more is missing from The Lion King 1-1/2. Clearly this was made for children, especially those who could care less for all of the above. I rented this from Netflix and was glad I was able to save my money. I would have made a big mistake thinking this would be an animated classic like its superlative namesake."
2,The Nature Of Truth And Reality,"I don't understand why this was made. Are the filmmakersinsinuating that the events of THE LION KING did not reallyhappen the way they happened in the original film? Ifthey are, then, cinematically speaking, THE LION KING is not trueto its own reality. Given the highly dubious nature of thisdirect-to-video fart joke, however, I think it's safe to say that the events of THE LION KING are indisputable and concrete."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"From the previews I thought this movie looked much better than the last Lion King sequel and I was right. The original Lion King is still the best but this one is very good. Lion King 1 1/2 is a little more upbeat and less violent than the original. It also has some catchy songs, too. Another good thing about the movie is it has almost all of the original voice talent. If you liked the original Lion King and were disapointed with Lion King 2, you should watch Lion King 1 1/2. You too will be pleasantly surprise."
2,Going for the quick buck,No wonder Roy Disney left the company accusing Michael Eisner of going for the 'quick buck' with low quality products. What a crappy movie.
3,Lion King 1 1/2,It's kind of a bad movie but if you enjoy Lion King would LOVE this and have lots of fun with it.
5,PERFECT!!!,"This movie arrived to me perfectly! No scratches on it, no artwork damage or damage to the case. The movie shows just like new. My 18 month old son has watched it everyday since the day it arrived. THANK YOU! i didn't know online shopping could be so easy."
2,Not what I expected.... Rather boring....,"I understand that this is from Timone and Pumba's point of view.. But I thought that some of it was a blaitant tear down of the first film! The scene that pointed it out to me was where they supposidly made Simba and Nala fall down that hell during the ""Can you Feel the Love Tonight?"" sequence... And most of the time we see them jabbering like Siskel and Ebert during parts of the movie.. All we see is their shadows! After a while I stopped the film and went to disc 2 and played the jungle verson of ""Millionare"" and that was more fun then the film itself...I would stick to the Lion King and Lion King 2 Simba's Pride.. These other films were so much better..."
2,A poor use of the Disney imprimatur,"My [child], who loved Lion King and Lion King 2, (...)declared it was a boring film and just not fun to watch. He didn't like the use of the movie theater review concept, and that there really wasn't a story, just vignettes.When it's a video that doesn't qualify as a theater release, caveat emptor."
1,One and a half is right (stars that is),"Disney, the word itself brings images of magic, great storytelling and fun and entertaining. This movie is none of these.I noticed right from the start that I was annoyed watching this film. The constatnt interuption of Timones ""remote"",which I assume was supposed to be clever, turns out to be annoying. What was Disney Thinking??? Unoriginal in every way. It actually ruins my ability to even want to watch the original ""Lion King""! As endearing as Timone and Pumba are, they can't pull a whole feature on their own. Sorry Disney.I'm even sorrier I forked over twenty hard earned dollars for this ""film"".This film is only a rehash of the first one, who realy cares about these two guys. I know I didn't come away feeling very entertained. This is Disney recycled. Save your money folks.I wish I did. :("
1,Desperate attempt to milk the Lion King fame,"I loved the Lion King, and even enjoyed the second one. This however, totally destroys the first one. All it does is take the first movie and stick Timon and Pumbaa where they don't belong, along with throwing in some random things about Timon's family. There is one cute song in the beginning, but that is one of the only redeeming qualities of this movie. You might as well watch the original, and if you want a new and interesting plot watch the second. Don't waste your time on this"
3,Boring movie?,"Hey, I bought the DVD and I thought it was going to be better than the other Lion Kind movies. Turns out to be the worst one. Timon and Pumba interrupts the movie, and it doesn't really show the theme, so what's it about anyway, just behind the scene of Timon and Pumba, what else. Overall, I thought it was okay, and well, it was sorta funny, but I only watched it once, and got bored of it."
4,this isn't so bad...,"this movie is not that bad , i'm deducting one star because when the movie is on ,timon and pumba pause the movie , that's the bad thing!but the rest it's ok ,the animation,they have all the original voices that they had in the first movie , which makes this one cool, and i included this movie on my disney collection , i love all disney movies.anyway timon and pumba tell the story from their point of view, how they rescued simba,and how they met each other,this movie is really fun ,if i liked it that i'm 14 , your kids will too.enjoy it!"
5,LION KING DVD,This is a great Disney sequel. My kids watch this DVD over and over. The characters are fun and the animation is wonderful.
2,Dvd and shipping Were in excellent fashion,the DVD cant stay in the case due to a broken center piece... other than that the case appears to be first editon and unopened
2,Not impressed,My little one did not like it at all and I don't blame her. Is so boring. Nothing like the real movie.
2,BAD in-between movie!,Why put this out... don't waste your money... it's a narrative of the first lion king. not intertaining to him or i. Have watched this DVD ONCE in the 2 yearsish I've had it.
2,"You all must be kidding, this movie sucked!","I don't know what you all are thinking who gave this movie anything above a 3, but it was NOT good. Where was the story, where was the plot, the climax, the suspense, the love???? It was BORING!!!! A couple nice songs, but NO STORY! If it was that great, why would it go straight to video???? Makes you wonder, doesn't it? Rent it once, you won't want to see it again."
1,"Old Movie, Bad quality","THis is a funny movie that has a second DVD with bonus activities and games. Unfortunately, we received an old DVD box with old, dirty and scratched DVDs inside. I managed to clean the first DVD (the one with the movie) but the second DVD gets frozen during the games. This DVD is part of my son's Christmas wish list presents, so we cannot return it. But we got frustrated. I had to tell him that Santa did not sent this but the 'naughty elf' ! I will never purchase a DVD on line. Better go to a store."
2,Lion King DVD,DVD was scratch..ad had said looked new..the main DVD I was able to watch with the scarteches but the special features dvd is really scratch that my dvd player will not play the movie.
1,What the....,"i was very disappointed. it came in a case that was meant for multiple cdroms for sims or something. so when i got it, the disks were all scratched up and everything, so now it skips."
4,The Lion King 1 1/2-a review,"Although, I am starting to outgrow the Lion King, I quite liked it. Hearing the story of Pumba and Timon, I actually understand everything! In the first Lion King, it was nice, but it was a little confusing and not as informative. It gave me a few questions that were answered when Lion King 1 1/2 came out. Although, I did not hear about it until my brother discovered the movie at my cousins' house. So the only thing is it was a little hard to find."
5,Amazing,This movie is just amazing. I have always loved Disney movies and this is really the first one to take a movie from a different perspective away from the main characters. The kids and I have watched this movie almost every other day since we got it. We just love this movie.
4,It was good,"The comedy was a bit too much...very cliche. But it is a cute movie, I could do without having it though..."
5,A Great Movie,"This movie is not exactly a sequel to the Lion King 1, It was more of a behind the scenes movie of the lion king 1 mostly from Timon and Pumba's view. This movie was a funny, entertaining, and family oriented movie. This movie is a must have for any family."
3,lion king 1 1/2,"This upsets me that we waited and waited for the release of lion king 1 1/2 to learn that it is only a DVD release. We had planned on throwing a huge theater party with our scout troop, now we will have to find another cartoon in theaters to watch. No one wants to stay home and watch a movie if there is an option to watch one in the theater. A bad movie in the theater is still more fun than a good movie at home--it's the theater experience. I am sure kids will like the DVD, however, they would rather go to the theater and see something else, than sit at school or home and watch one. (I have no opinion of the star rating, I was required to enter something to send this form.)"
1,We wanted a DVD.,It was not made clear that I was purchasing a VHS. We were looking for the DVD. Now there is a very impatient 5 year old that has to do it the old-school way and watch previews.
1,Still waiting...,I ordered this movie over a month ago. I'm still waiting for it to arrive. I've seen the movie before and liked it a lot. I'm looking forward to sharing it with my family (if I ever receive it).
5,Great Insight,"Although this film is supposed to be fit in between The Lion King and The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, I think it gives us a little insight to more of the original cast in the same setting that TLK was filmed in. We loved it for its comedic moments."
2,Not half as good as 1,"Some cute songs and lots of movie quotes to hold the adults, but the kids wandered away half way thru. Wait til it goes on sale."
2,Shameless copying from the original,"I had a chance to watch ""The Lion King 1 1/2"" yesterday, and I was impressed at the degree to which a studio can copy from itself, without any shame. I would have to say probably half the movie was copied from the original, or built around it in a way that is probably reflected well in the title. I give it 2 stars and not one, because in the 50% or so that is original, there are a handful of funny lines by Timba.It's not really a sequel or a prequel, nor does it add too much to the whole story. Bottom line, it goes into why Timon and Pumba were on their own prior to meeting Simba, and then it goes into a little more into their life together as a trio of buddies without any worries in life. All in all, it seems like another way Disney deviced to further milk a great franchise. Don't buy it."
1,Disappointment,"Lots of recycled footage and jokes from a film I already own. I'm disappointed in Disney for milking the Lion King franchise to this level.In my eyes, this was a pure mistake and could be a bad sign of things to come. I did not enjoy this film, my wife did not enjoy it, and my children did not enjoy it.Stick with the original."
2,Elusive,"These replacement spools are extremely difficult to find. One would think that being a B&D product it would be everywhere. I checked every hardware store, walmart, kmart, the military stores (AAFES-I'm retired Army), farm stores and even bugged my neighbors. No doubt, I regret the purchase of the trimmer. However, I am sticking with it to avoid spending money on a different one. Plus, the strings are way too short."
1,don't buy black & decker,I bought this replacement spool from Amazon because Wally World didn't carry it anymore for the weedwhacker I bought from them. I had already bought the replacement recommended on the box before which let out all the line in no time causing a nasty wrap-up in the motor. When I got this one it did the same thing. I wouldn't buy another automatic garbage weedwhacker ever.
1,very bad. a disaster,the trimmer came. as soon as I used it stopped working. it got in fire. I returned the merchandise but I lost shipping. why? not my fault it did not work. very very veryt poor transaction.
5,"Need to have replacement line, buy what works, perfectly","I have had my cordless Grasshog for 4 months now, and I tell you, this line and chord system are well engineered, easy to use, self feeding, and easy to replace. I have had no problems, and I do weekly trimming during the summer. This line lasts a lot of hours on standard city lot trimming. There is no reason to try and use a cheep substitute, this last a long time, and is made right for the Automatic Feed System (AFS). Buy it here or any hardware store for around 6-8 dollars. A GOOD DEAL !!!"
4,"Nice, but a bit expensive","They work great, but are a bit expensive for the amount of line you get on each one. For just a couple bucks more you can get 10 times more line and then all it takes is a few minutes to rewind the new string on the spool when it is empty. I did buy one of these so I always have a spare sitting on the shelf."
5,I'd give this more stars if I could,What a great album and an unbelievable singer. I can't say enough about how amazing this guy is. He's truely in a league way above many of today's 'hot' singers. Richard is unfortunately very underated. There's not a bad song on this entire album. I love it.
5,Another great one,"Well, What can I say? This album is by far my fave Cd Richard has ever done. It is a terrible thing that it didn't get promoted the way it deserved too. It is a work of art in my book. Every time I listen to it. I can't get enough. I recommend it to everyone."
3,Disappointing,"I am a very big Richard Marx fan, he goes sinonimous with my late teens and early 20's. I listen to his music and reminisc. He is lyrically the best singer and writer in my book. This cd though disappointed me. I was not impressed by any of the tracks and non of them left an impression. The music seemed to drown out his voice, which is by far every fans favorite. I dont regret the purchase since I have everyone of his CDs and will continue to buy others he releases. It really boggles my mind why he gave away the song ""This I promise you"" to N'sync, they did not do it justice. I am awaiting Days in Avalon, I am anxious to hear Richard on the vocals."
3,Why so serious?,"I haven't actually listened to this album, but lets just say I know the type. My question is ""why does R. Marx take himself so seriously?"". If the guy would just lighten up a little ala his earlier pop nugget, ""Satisfied"", he would have alot more success. His best song, ""Endless Summer Nights"", had one of the worst videos of all time. It was just too serious. The shots of R. Marx playing pool and then jump-cutting to his black car doing donuts in the parking lot of some turn of the century saloon, was just too much to take. This video baffles me."
5,This is why Richard has so many die-hard fans...,"If you've only vaguely heard of Richard Marx, or can just about remember Right Here Waiting, or even if you don't have a clue who this guy is, then buy this album. It's a mixture of lazy maturity combined with funky attitude. Richard shouts at the world, and wants folks to know, and yet he's a commited family man, and also wants the world to know. Eternity is slow and sexy, Until I find you again is powerfully moving, and My Confession is designed to knock your socks off. What are ya waitin' for? Talk To Ya Later."
5,great in the kitchen,"I use mostly all natural cleaners; but every now and then, I feel like I need a good sanitizer, especially in the kitchen. I can't use vinegar (my go-to cleaner) on granite, so this is perfect!"
2,Not worth the price.,"Terrible images: is this a book or a newspaper?!A lot of info about metal processes but that is it. It has some of plastics, a bit of rubber (like one page or something), and nothing else. Come on Jim, Industrial Design is much more than metal or plastic!Guido."
2,Disappointing,"One needs to bring some critical thinking to work as to what one buys and reads. I fully agree with reader Guido. Images are blurred, of extremely poor quality and not truly informative. There is only a small number of examples offered in the book (as if this were an attempt to bring about a touch of reality to a text that would otherwise be even dryer and engineering-oriented). The limited range of materials and processes is not representative of the industrial design practice. Besides, conceptual categories which were employed to organize the book seemed to me quite confusing and not logically classified. The author does show knowledge of the subject. However, his approach is not particularly didactical and complete--and therefore not as useful as it could be. I don't feel this is the right text and the right form for industrial designers. The book, in my opinion, does not live up to the promise of its title and price."
2,ace journalist goes for the fast buck with old clippings,"A book on the most dominant american cyclist of his generation by the only mainstream american sports journalist that actually understands the sport. the problem is that this book is nothing more than a compilation of old articles, and obviously done in a rush as well. typos litter the book, the images are far from impressive (the majority are from the '99 tour, and have as much quality as a fans pics taken with a disposable camera). altogether a waste of my money. if you want to learn about armstrong, then buy 'it's not about the bike', and don't waste your time or money on this."
2,It's Lance that made this interesting,"If you like Lance, you might enjoy this. It reads like a series of articles rather than a cohesive story. You'd get a fact stated in one paragraph and then restated as if it were new two paragrahs later.Although interesting, I can't think of much in the book that we didn't hear from the TDF TV coverage.The copy editing was probably the worst I've ever come across in any published book. It drove my wife so batty that she had to stop reading it."
2,read its not about the bike,"read its not about the bike it may have been ""ghost written"" but it has the proper prespective and an editor that passed high school english."
5,great gel,My husband loves this gel. He was getting a small rash around his neck after shaving. This has really helped. We even used it when our daughter got her eczema. very soothing
4,worth the money.,"or atleast the 6 bucks i paid for it..fast action, buta bit tad boreing parts too.. very extreme,"
3,Gravity Games,This is a good solid video but you can't go wrong with MSP's new movie Ski Movie I recomend that over this Gravity games so called video.
5,Little giant,"There are probably more authentic ways to make real BBQ, but nothing any easier. If what you like about BBQ is the flavor, not the work, this unit is for you. Add water to the pan, chips to holder, put some dry rubbed pork [...] on one (or all) of the four grates, light the gas and you are good to go. It holds temperature very well unattended. Adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want. Your friends will think you are a genius."
2,Size too big to swallow - Don't like it,"It may be easy on your stomach (which I can't tell personally), but way too big to swallow for me - I am an average size adult (5'7"", 145lb). I had to break it into halves each time. But then breaking makes the edge sharp and rough, so it is still difficult to swallow. I don't recommend it."
2,Too cheaply made to be trusted,The flat bracket that goes around the back of the monostay and attaches to the rack is made of such a soft metal that as I screwed the bolts into the horseshoe shaped piece it simply bent and could not be made completely tight. When I attach something to my bike I like to think that it's going to stay put and not wiggle around. I gave it two stars because it's probably okay for light loads.
3,Gets the job done.,"Great so far, only about 50 miles of riding. I ride a tandem and had to mount the bracket about half way up on the stoker seatpost but the rubber coating on the loop sticks well. Rear rack is very stable with this setup. The small pad between the C bracket and the seatpost slips off and leaves a gooey residue, but not a huge issue. Overall very good, and if it holds up and doesn't break I would give it four stars. It's a bummer paying more in shipping than the item cost, but I couldn't even find a bike shop that knew what a mono-stay adapter is, never mind actually selling it."
3,Not for Trek Navigators,"Be forewarned: this adapter might be too small for your bike!It is too small to fit around the monostay on my Trek Navigator 300 comfort/hybrid bike. The ""U"" bar would need to have arms that were about least 1/4 inch longer.Your bike might be fine. My Trek has thick frame bars."
5,Critical Things to Consider,"I bought this book when I got remarried in 1995, and we will be celebrating 12 successful years together. This book affirmed exactly the process that we were going through early in our marriage. It made us really think about and negotiate our expectations for each other and our children. Although there were bumps along the way, this book gave us critical things to consider to successful navigate the road we are on."
4,Very nice set.,"The Polar Express set is really unique. The train is beautiful; the bell is a fun feature, and I love the way the scenery works. It's really clever, I think, to have the snowman and tree hold up the houses. Very unique and distinctive!The tunnel, like the Brio Mountain Adventure Figure 8 set's tunnel (which has the same shape but different coloration), is beautiful but a bit short. Our Maple Landmark Name Train and Little Engine That Could have clearance issues with it, but that's pretty common since they're so tall.My big beef with this set is that there are no magnets on the engine. In order to connect the engine to another train, one must hook the engine to its tender and use the tender for the connection. A bit frustrating, particularly if you're a kid who just wants to hook a train up.Still, as I said, this set is very unique, and its combination of features makes it irresistible desipte the drawbacks."
2,Too much to too little,"The house a 2 dimensional cut sheets of plastic with an image only on one side.The train can only really be pulled and not pushed because the car behind the engine has a different kind of link that makes it awkward to push.Everything else is standard Brio. If you decide to buy this, you definately want to get the North Pole set with the Christmas tree as it makes a wonderful sound."
4,We love it,"We love the Brio train set, and are in the process of collecting a Brio set for each of our sons birthdays and Christmas'. The wood is soft enough so that a child that is rough with it can toss it around and it may get dented, but doesnt break. The only negative with this particular set is that the plastic scenery pieces dont seem to stand well in the wooden stands. Other than that, we are loyal Brio buyers because you can collect to your hearts content and always know that they will mix and match with the other sets."
4,"a very good set, but the bruce lee movies are not that hot",the bruce lee part of this set is really just three movies that use clips of bruce so don't think your getting some of his best. that is the reason for the 4 star rating. the other movies are really fun martial arts movies with sonny chiba in them and they look good. so if you like these movies this is a really good set.
3,"Good, but disappointing","Even though the product came well packaged, and in the deadline stablished for an international delivery, the product itself came a little short on my expectations, the quality of the movies is a little over that of an old VHS, but, for this price you get what you paid for..."
1,Worst piece of garbage I've ever bought,"Bruce Lee may be the photo on the cover, but there's only one Bruce Lee movie in this collection, Fists of Fury, and it looks like it was taken off an old print. You get vertical lines randomly appearing throughout the movie, and the sound won't work properly with a home theater system. You'd be better off just buying a watchable copy of Fists of Fury, and ignoring this."
1,wasted my money,"First problem I had was that there was very little info. on instalation and ""how to"". After instalation, regestration is required, I never got past this spot, message indicated program was regestered in my name, contacted support several times and followed all their tips and and passwords, still got errors when trying to use ""user name and Password"", never was able to get on line, eventualy following all their instructions I was not even able to go to the site napster.com at all."
1,Thank Metallica for this,Napster sucks hard compared to what it used to be when it was free! Thanks MEtallica. This software suck bad and barely works.
4,Hit or miss,"May I say first of all - what a great price for this product! I didn't use it in a traditional way, as in say, a flower arrangement. I used it instead as stars in a painting I made for a friend. The first set of lights (2 sets per package) worked for a day and then failed to light. Fortunately, there was the second set as back up. I had no issues with that one. I handed the defective set to my tinkering son and he was able to figure out what was wrong with the first set - the bulb had loosened, thus not lighting up. Except for this glitch, I would have awarded 5 stars. I love the concept and will look for other ways to incorporate the lights into my different projects."
1,A fraud by the label,"Don't bother tracking this one down, Its not what it claims to be - the first two tracks are studio outakes from MoonDog Matinee with audience noise overdubbed and the rest are outtakes from the Rock of Ages album (all of which is now available on the reissues)"
3,"A great story, but only an OK book.","In ""The Niihau Incedent,"" Beekman uses interviews of some of the principal individuals in the story, along with thorough research of historical recodrd and news accounts, to relate the story of the ""invasion"" of the Hawai'ian island of Ni'ihau by a Japanese pilot during WWII. This is a fascinating story, and well worth reading, although the book is not particularly well-written."
3,"Great topic, mediocre execution","A Japanese pilot crash lands in Hawaii after the Pearl Harbor attack and convinces a Japanese-American to take his co-workers hostage in an effort to retrieve some secret papers. That nonfictional story-line alone earns this three stars. Beekman does a yeoman's job ferreting out the details and working it into a book. However, I'm guessing Beekman, who was a reporter, was better at writing newspaper stories than this full length book. He uses a clear, but rather dry, narrative style. Beekman's advocacy for Japanese immigrants also raises its head a few times at the end of the book. Not that it bothers me, but it makes you wonder whether his point of view may have colored any of his reporting of the incident itself. Pictures and one handy map are nice additions."
4,Learned about this at the Pacific Aviation Museum,"A little bit of Hawaii history that many may not know. I found it to be quite illuminating about the status and beliefs of the citizenry at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. One is stimulated to think what one would do, as did these citizens of Ni'ihau."
1,Worst. Book. Ever.,"Maybe I'm just too ignorant about art to really get this book, but it's terrible, confusing, and the authors feel like they're trying to go right over my head.I bought it for a class and promptly returned it when the teacher decided it was too hard for us. Yeah.So call me stupid, whatever. This book sucks and makes me hate my own gender."
3,Fills in the blanks,"Owning older Nikon equipment and/or wishing to purchase some, this book is useful. I purchased this book to identify when certain Nikon lenses were in production. I had to update my knowledge of the Nikon world. This was most helpful when I had to replace a lens I had dropped...OOPS...In addition the Flash chapter was illuminating in regards to the many speedlights that Nikon has to offer. Listing the benefits and drawbacks to certain models helped me meet my needs on Ebay. However, more subjective than objective, it still is worth the price if you're in the market for used Nikon equipment."
2,Too many errors,"I am not sure whether he has used those cameras or not, buttoo many mistakes, non-exist features, wrong descriptions ..."
4,A great book for Nikon users,"I don't have the newest edition of this book, but it does not matter if you only purchase vintage Nikon equipment. This book has indepth information on all the Nikon SLR equipment and accesories made in the last fourty years. I find this a true asset when you are a collecter of Nikon equipment. Unfortantly, not all the reviews on items are detailed enough to inform, also because new equipment is introduced yearly it is never up to date. But, still the book is worth getting if you don't have an older edition. Not to bad."
4,Much more info than you'll find online,"If you're a Nikon diehard, you already know about the Bjorn site, and the mir site (From Singapore)Peterson's book covers some of the same info, but in much greater depth with much more detail. Even down to serial numbers and production runs.It's a good companion to those sites, but in the end much better since you are spared the wild navigation, missing info and what are sometimes just cursory mentions of Nikon bodies and lenses. In fact if you've seen the Bjorn site, as good as it is, you know that some of his info is practically useless since its little more than a couple sentences.This book is a steal at the prices you see for some of the used copies."
2,Geek Book,"This book was rated very well, however I found it to be almost useless. I recently received a new Nikon F-100. A former Cannon user my interest was in finding more detailed information about Nikon autoexposure modes, metering system(s), lens options, flash's etc. Instead I got a history of Nikon products, starting with the coal burning models, interspersed with the personal opinions of the author. This guy probably sleeps with his F-5. The book is for Nikon geeks, or people who frequently buy and sell Nikon equipment, or people who have the Nikon version of Trivial Pursuit, not for people who want to know how to use their Nikon equipment. Inspite of the reviews I also ordered the Magic Lantern Guide for the F-100. This book was panned in most reviews, but I found it to be much more on the mark for my purposes. Yes there is too much space used to explain basic photograpic concepts but it is still compact and fairly well organized."
3,pretty good,pretty good... but overpriced! You can buy a cheaper one and see the same thing... these are my five more words.
3,Works well,"I bought this Ear Scope to check my labradoodle's ears after walks where she can run through cheat grass. It works well, but I wish the black tips didn't fall off so easily."
2,Abysmal Service - Hassle Isn't Worth the Product,"I had to send several emails, a telephone call and finally a Paypal complaint to get action. The hassle isn't worth the product. Williams-Sonoma's croissants bake better, and their delivery is always fast and accurate. I'll be using them in the future. Of three purchases only one was delivered correctly. The second order was totally incorrect; plain croissants instead of chocolate ones. I gave them another try because the company did correct that order via 2-day delivery instead of the usual 4-day delivery. But the latest order was also incorrect, and it took almost 2 weeks for them to send the missing item even though it was in stock. The product is OK at best and has gone up in price. Shipping is very high."
5,Snap this one up while you can!,"Okay, so McLuhan is offbeat, a bit random in his organization, and has been dead for 16 years. This book, however, represents McLuhan's unique insight. It creates a text in the purest sense of the word. Pictures and words are used to drive home his point--one must read both the words and the images. In short, it is a good introduction to McLuhan's insight. Be forewarned: this will be the beginning of a relationship with this man's work"
2,A Breezy Little Book ... that fell apart before I finished it,"You can quite easily read this book in one hour. It's a fun little compendium of McLuhan ideas and reflections. As with most things McLuhan, the material holds up despite the passage of time and the evolution of media. One big problem: the pages began to fall out of the binding about midway through my read (yes, after .5 hour). There's some ""medium is the message"" irony here, but it's probably too obvious for me to discern it. Either way, shame on the publisher for their slipshod binding, which, alas, compels me to rate this product 2- rather than 4-stars."
4,informational yet strange,"My son needed this book for a college computer class. It looked interesting so I read it. There are a lot of photos and images that in some cases emphasizes the author's topics. Other photos and images are just weird and I don't understand how they relate to the information the author is presenting. Overall, the book portrays the importance of media on our society today."
4,"A great, quick read.","Finally got around to getting this book. It's very thought provoking in regards to today's digital world, and I can imagine in the 60s it was even more enlightening."
5,The Medium is the Massage,"Even more meaningful in today's world of computers, hi-tech and soundbites than in the late 1950's or early 1960's when this was originally written. Some very interesting passages that make you think. Food for thought."
5,My view of the world ...,... was profoundly influenced by this book. I read it about 30 years ago. I'm pleasantly surprised to find it still in print.
4,Very good book. Almost prophetic.,"Some of McLuhans stuff is really unaccessible for average readers... It's deep stuff... BUT we see much of what he was talking about occuring in our modern day. It's really interesting. I think if he could have found a better way to present his philosphies he could have really made much more of a difference to our ""global community"""
5,McLuhan: Genius in guise of brilliance,"""The medium is the Massage"" is an amazing work that delves into the human psyche. Propaganda, via the media, affects the way we view the world around us. Fundamental truths are questioned by McLuhan, and the result: The Global Village.McLuhan is the ""Sun Tzu"" of media philosophy. It's hard to imagine anyone dethroning him anytime soon.Great Book!Alexander C. PigeoneBookNet.com"
2,Not fully intact,"The book arrived in a semi-good condition. The pages were fine, and the cover was fine (unscoffed and un-torn), but when you opend the cover, the binding wasn't fully glued together. the cover came straight off the pages. I had to glue it back together."
1,Silly,"I was inspired to buy this book because of the frequent references Neil Postman (one of my favorite authors) makes to it. Evidently Postman had already squeezed every possible drop of wisdom from this book and left a considerable amount of rubbish. Keep in mind the book is 85% images - lame b/w pictures from the 60s and 70s that Boomers would have found ""thought provoking"". A good book for left-over Hippies who don't like to read or if you are part of the ephemeral ""Occupy something"" crowd. Otherwise, read Postman.Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology"
3,Interesting account of a trip to the Maldives in the 1930s.,"T.W. Hockly spent many weeks in the Maldives in 1935 and his book is an interesting account of his time there. He tells about life in the islands, and especially in the capital Male' where he actually spent his time. His account is interspersed with historical and political commentary, much of which is useful to put his experience in context. Most of the time he writes a captivating prose, though it can get a bit dry toward the end of the book. This is an interesting read for those who may go the the islands today as it will allow a deeper understanding of the country's cultural and social background that can be gained in a resort or a diving boat!"
4,European Business,It is a highly informative book which is easy to follow due to its issue based approach. I use it as one of the recommended readings in a course on Business in Europe in a couple of Polytechnics. The only thing is that it is getting to be rather badly out of date.
4,'A definate must for anyone studying European Business',"A definate must for anyone studying European Business. This book explains the complexities of the European Union, from it's founding to the present day. Key topics include European Community Law, Regional Policies and Macroeconomic Integration. Aimed at all levels, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the topic in an easy to understand format with excellent case studies and reference material. I wouldn't have got through a HND without it!"
3,Atlas Accompanying the Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition,"The maps, albeit of historical interest, are in such small print and graphics that it is difficult to readily track to comparative locations in terms of today's geography and nomenclature."
2,Not Worth The Money,"This bicycle is poorly constructed and the wheels, especially are extremely flimsy. So flimsy, in fact, is the front wheel that it does not rotate straight and scrapes the front fender if you put it on. The assembly instructions are printed so small that you almost need a microscope to read them. And the diagrams are impossible to make heads or tails of. This product is worth about half its selling price. Don't waste your money on it."
5,The Text for Mathematical Models of Reality,"From discrete to continuous modelling, with many proyects and examples, I like very spacially this book for the undergraduate level. The presentation is very clear, but rigurous, making experience the reader through the models. It focuses on the interpretation and ends with some tools for modelbuilding. For a start of mathematical model understanding of reality this book is specially good, clear and completely well written. Good job Mr. Giordano and Weir! See also: Mesterton-Gibbons:An aproach to Mathematical Modelling, Fowler: Mathematical Models in the Sciences, Beltrami: Mathematics for Dynamical Modeling, Morrison: The Art of Modeling Dynamical Systams and Giordano: Differential Equations a Modeling Aproach."
5,Molly Hatchet's Debut Is An Ace,"Molly Hatchet broke out of the gate with a bang on their self-titled debut album. Critics unfairly compared them to another three-guitar band from Jacksonville, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and I don't know why, because the Outlaws, who were from Tampa and had three guitars, never had that problem. ""Bounty Hunter"" is about a man who hunts down criminals; ""Gator Country"" is about following your own muse; ""The Creeper"" is a cautionary tale of what happens if you don't watch your step; ""The Price You Pay"" is a tale from the point of view of a man sentenced to death; ""Dreams I'll Never See"" tells us to hang on in the face of adversity; ""I'll Be Running"" relates the story of a man on the run; ""Cheatin' Woman"" tells of love gone wrong; and the closer, ""Trust Your Old Friend"", reminds us that people need each other. Overall, a great debut from an amazing Southern rock band."
4,My baby loves it!,We received this book as a gift when our son was born so we started reading it to him quite early. He is 10 months old now and this is his absolute favorite book. He figured out how to press the button to start the music and LOVES it. I agree that it is a little louder than I would prefer but it is not obnoxious. This is the last thing he holds in his hands before he goes to sleep and bedtime has gotten so much easier!
2,Not so much,"It works, but it's a little more cumbersome than I expected it to be. Had to tape the hose to my blower/vac to get it to stay. Better than the prior bag I had on the vac, but not much better."
4,Great Buy!,"This system basically completed my Black & Decker Leaf Hog. I had owned the leaf hog for a couple of years before I had decided to buy this system. It really does shorten this dreadful job, allowing me more time to do more honey do's ."
2,poor quality,"great initially but after 10 minutes of use and 2 bags of leaves the hose is like a sieve, ruptured at 7 different places. wondering whether to return it or just duct tape it. a longer hose would be more helpful too. great idea otherwise."
1,Never again!,"Bought a Black & Decker LF-4500 last year and after two seasons (and a very small yard), the blade is worn out and the bag blew out. I've read these same problems from many other unfortunate buyers of this low quality product. Never again will I buy another Black & Decker product as I've had similar quality issues with their appliances & tools."
3,Leaf Collection System,"The product meets the basic needs but the main problem is that the bag does not stay on the garbage can. Also, plan on getting really dirty. The dust created is not fully captured by the cover so everything gets coated in dust."
2,Too Expensive for what it is,"My leafhog's burlap bag was torn so I had a choice: Either buy a replacement bag, or buy this ""timesaver"".At $28-$30, this t-can adapter isn't worth the money. I would have been happy with it if it costed ~$15. But at $30, it really is hard to strap to the trash can and a lot of grindings spill out when removing and emptying the full trash bag. It also takes a some time to get set up. I felt ""faster"" with the burlap bag and emptying more frequently.I think others have it right when they suggest not using a round trashcan. I think the collection system has promise but first use was not so great. At a lower price, I would have felt a little better -- but since both this and replacement bag are ~$30, I should have just gone with the bag."
2,"Good idea, but needs more durability",Product developed a hole in the plastic tubing on the first use.Duct tape will prolong its life only so long.Also the cloth is too small to cover the top of my leaf disposal container.
4,Huge time saver!,"Just how I imaged I would have designed one. A huge time saver for full yard applications. From my perspective, a must have."
4,Works pretty well,I probably bagged almost 20 bags of leaves using this attachment which normally would have been 50+. It is designed for a rectagular/square trash can but I was able to get it to work ok with the round ones I have. It is extremely dusty grinding up the leaves. On a day there was no wind I was filthy from head to toe. The weather didn't cooperate much but I'd do it on a day with a small breeze to blow the dust away from you. The product did its job well. I used my older leaf blower to clean this attachment after I was all done. Well work the money.
2,leaf cover - Black and Decker,"It is a great idea. However, the hose connecter that attaches to the blower does not want to stay connected and you have to continue stopping the blower to re attach it. I will be sending this back for a total refund."
5,Blower vacuum leaf collection System,"I owned the first generation of this device. This year's model has various improvements that result in stronger suction and the whole thing which was good before is better now.The first model had a longer tube and nozzle for the blower which fit me better. I'm 6'2.I have about 40 leaf dropping dropping trees in my yard and this thing is a tool that makes the job do-able for an empty nester. If you have three teen agers living at home, put them to work. If you don't, get this product."
2,Would be a great item but hose got holes right away,"Sure wish Black and Decker would get their act together. The bag that came with the leaf vacuum lasted 1 season then the stitching on the zipper started to unwind. 2nd season of use and zipper ripped and came off track renderng the bag useless. I decided to try this instead. Worked pretty good, a slight challenge getting the cover to stay on the waste bin. Then notice holes in the hose. I have not contacted company for a replacement yet but can't expect a replacement will hold up any better."
2,"Great idea, not so great product","I bought this because I have a good number of trees in my front and back yard and thought this would be a great way to make leaf clean-up faster, but I was disappointed. I ended up buying a gas powered blower instead and I love it. I will say for very few leaves or just to clean off a patio or deck, this might work good, I just needed something much more powerful."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This product looks good on paper but doesn't perform as expected. The flex tube is prone to fouling as debris gets caught in kinks as you move about. Also the bag-end of the tube tends to clog up quickly as soon as your garbage can fills, so you have to keep a constant eye on that end of the tube. Once the tube gets clogged on the bag end, debris fills the tube and it becomes seriously impacted. At this point you have to stop operations and unclog the tube. If you've been at this for a while you start to wonder why the vacuum doesn't work as effectively as it should. I wound up unclogging the tube around 5 or 6 times before I gave up on this product."
3,Adequate but not outstanding,"As you all know by now, the ""collection system"" is a tube combined with a net to put over a trash can. I have a small lot, with two bordering oak trees. I was hoping the system would help reduce most of my raking, but this is not the case. In my situation it just can't keep up with the volume of leaves. However, it is handy for pickups of small piles of leaves and those in hard-to-collect areas, like my driveway, around the bushes, and corners around objects like the deck. It's basically an outdoor vacuum. It would be nice if the tube were a bit longer and stronger, and it tends to get in the way and get stepped on. So although its uses are limited, I would say this is a good tool for the autumn arsenal.I liked the other reviewer's comments about cutting a hole in the lid of the trash can to feed the tube through. If you do that and cut another hole for exhaust, it makes getting the netting on and off much easier."
3,leaf collection system,"attaches to blower vac great. Sometimes the hose gets twisted and clogs up. Sometimes the hose comes unattached to the fabric. The drawstring for the fabric isn't high quality. Overall is does a great job, just wish it was constructed a little better."
2,"Difficult to use, particularly in cold weather","The B&D; vacuum extension is not very effective. The primary issues are:1. The hose is too short to allow the flexibility of moving around without constantly moving the leaf collection container.2. The hose needs some sort of clamp to hold it in place on top of the flexible container cover. It tends to pull out of the cover and blow leaves in unintended paces.3. The hose is fairly stiff in cold weather (32 degrees). This aggravates the problems listed in 1 and 2 above. All of these problems may be resolved by use in warm weather, but leaf collection is normally associated with cold weather."
4,"Delivered as ordered, can't ask for more","Yard work is always work, this product isn't perfect, but does make leaf collection easier. Wish the collection hose was double the length"
4,Leaf Collection System,"I bought this item because the factory bag that came with my leaf vacuum got a tear in it. I wasn't fond of the original bag because of it's limited capacity and weight on your shoulder. I used this item with a 32 gallon trash can on wheels and it is easy to use. To connect it's simple just pull the bag over the lip of the trash can and pull the draw string. I haven't had any issues with the draw string like some of the other reviews stated but I could see how a bungee cord would fix the issue. This item makes picking up leaves much easier and quicker than the factory bag. Overall, I'm pleased with the item. The only problem I've had has been with the trash can getting knocked over when I get to far from it but I believe the issue is because the base of the can is narrow."
4,Works better than the little bags,Doesn't stay on top of trash can all that well ... But best alternative . Unless you like dumping bag every five minutes
2,"Functional, but not durable","The leaf collection system works reasonably well, provided leaves are dry. It is a big improvement over the tiny bag that comes with the vacuum. However, hose developed cracks/splits after using three times. (Now has duct tape on it.)"
4,Removing fall leaves not a problem now!,"This system makes leaf raking almost obsolete. Imagine vacuuming your leaves right into a trash can lined with a plastic leaf bag. When the can is full, remove the filled bag and place it out for collection. The only raking involved is getting the leaves into small piles ready for the vacuum. This item would get 5 stars if the method of attaching the collection system to the trash can was better."
1,Good Idea - Fails in Application,"My blower/sucker failed to have enough ""wind"" power to move the chopped leaves along the plastic hose to the container. Complete failure."
1,VERY DISSATISFIED,"I ordered a leaf blower for a Christmas present. there were delays in it coming, and it only has part of the thing. it only has the tube. i ordered the whole system, or at least, i thought that i did. i will be returning whatever the heck i received right after Christmas."
1,cloggs,It is hard to ft over some cans and keep on. Hose can clog. I returned it. OK for small clean ups but to do a yard with leaves it was more trouble than it worth.
5,B&D Leaf Collection System,"This product is a lifesaver if you have a lot of leaves. I had a B & D Blower/Vacuum with shoulder bag and it would take me forever because the bag had to be dumped every few minutes. Now, I attach the hose to a 45 gal trash bucket with bag inside and mulching leaves is so much nicer. Great job Black & Decker."
1,lousy quality,we have used the Black & Decker leaf hog for several years and been very happy with it. We have replaced the hose more than once because we really use it alot but the hose always lasted about 1.5-2 seasons. This new hose ripped when we used it the first time..I am NOT happy and will seek alternatives!
1,Tore after 5 minutes of use,I purchased this at Lowes along with the BV-4000. The hose tore after using it for 5 minutes. I returned it to Lowes and found out that the BV-4000 was recalled. I will be returning it as well.
2,Black and Decker Leaf Collection System,"The BV006 blower/vac is great and I would rate that separately with 4 1/2 stars, but the leaf collection attachment that is designed to fit over a large trash can is mostly ineffective. It loses most of its vacumn suction and therefore is more trouble than it is worth."
3,not totally compatable with new leaf hog,Product did not attach to new leaf hog correctly so it would fly off spewing leaves everywhere unless it was being held on while in use. Hose also developed a hole after several uses. This product worked well with the older versions of this leaf hog.
2,Review of Leaf ccollection system black & decker,"After trying several times to get the cover to stay on garbage can, finally got it to stay but with much leakage of leaf material. The bigger problem is that before 1 hour was up, the hose had split in 3 different places requiring duct tape to get hose ruptures sealed. It is working, but ny opinion is that more ruptures will occur. This was while ""vacuuming"" the lawn - no strain on the motor and should not have been any problem with the hose."
3,pretty useful!,I was so excited about this product that I let the leaves build up in the garden while I waited for a delayed delivery.Its basically a great idea and good product. The product shot shows a round bin being used but I managed to fit the cover on my small green recycling wheely-bin fairly snugly. I can even stretch a large bin bag inside this bin and then tie it off for bagging. I just wish the tube was a foot or two longer. It gets the job done a lot more quickly than with the bag alone but its not as portable as the bag - hence the need for a longer tube.
3,Black & Decker Leaf Bagger,Big help with the constantly falling leaves. Two little complaints though: 1) the mulching action creates a lot of very fine dust(which is not good while vacuuming up around my pool). 2) the ground up leaves pile up around the rim of the trash can / collection bin and it falls out when the drawstring is released.
4,Blower Vac Accesory,"I am 5'2"" so it is a little ackward but it works great- sucks up and contains everything my blower/vac picks up. I have gone from thinking I have to get rid of the blower to wondering what can I use it on now."
4,Black & Decker Leaf Collection System,"Item works all right, but there is some leakage around the handle of the trash can. It collects many more leaves than the bag attachment, making vacuuming easier. I think that including the attachment adapters was a waste, since my blower/vac is a Black & Decker."
4,Great Idea but cheap material,"I tried the product the day I got it and was very satisfied with the job it did however, like a review I read before I ordered it the hose is made with very cheap, thin plastic. Within 15 minutes of using it, a twig poked thru the plastic. I guess I will have to start wrapping it in duct tape to toughen it up."
1,does NOT fit BV3100 Type 1,"headline says it all - NOT a '1 size fits all.' this is my 4th blower/mulcher, and all have had POS bags. perhaps I'll learn 1 of these days..."
4,Get the Greatest Hits versions,"This is a great compilation for any fan to add to their collection, but you might want to get the other two CD's that would be included in the Platinum set of Queen. The title does depict that these are songs are of Classic Queen. I got this CD because I already had the both Greatest Hits CDs that would've been included in the Plat. Collection and I might as well get it for to complete it. Overall this is a great CD for the fanatic Queen fans and fans of Classic Rock. I would recommend this to anyone and I would give this CD a 'B+' grade."
5,Classic Queen,"This truly is a wonderful compilation of Queen songs. The simple idea that an album of great songs could be created, without those songs having to be Number One hits is an excellent idea. This album brings some of Queen's finest works,which are overlooked, into public view. It helps settle once-and-for-all that Queen can do more than just sing sports anthems. By bringing Queen songs from their greatest hit 'Bohemian Rhapsody' to their lesser known debut single 'Keep Yourslef Alive' together in one place, Hollywood Records has made an instant classic."
1,This is the worst CD I have ever listened to!,"The Classic Queen CD should be burned! It was horrible, and listening to the lyrics made me want to cringe. They have horrible lyrics, along with corny pop beats. I hate almost every song on the CD. I liked the last song because I knew that the CD would soon be over."
5,The Best Queen In One Cd,I just love every song on this Cd. Its great to have evry song a classic and its the ones that bring back many memories of the wonderful past.The world is a much different place today the 1970s were the best times ever.
5,I recommend with...,"I try not to review best ofs too often but sometimes that's all I own of a group. It occured to me the other day that all the Queen I ever owned in the past I have sold off for cigarettes and beer while living in the cold depths of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.So I ran off to buy me some Queen. I figured I'd start with the most obvious and get all the hits I could. This collection is for sure a great way to start, with the hits like ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", ""We Will Rock You"" etc. I can't stop listening to it. Unfortunetly they had so many hits, they had to put out a second version called ""Classic Queen"" which has ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Under Pressure"" so I bought that one too. There is a remastered Greatest Hits out there but once again it doesn't have all the songs, perhaps one day someone will come up with the perfect Queen mix. Until then Queen Classic Queen and Queen's Greatest Hits will do just fine."
5,"Great for the TRUE fans, and a nice intro for new ones...","No, this is NOT a completely comprehensive collection of all of Queen's better-known works (aka the ones you hear on the radio). What it is, however, is a fanatastic introduction to the true breadth and depth of their work in-between the more popular tunes. This was my first Queen album (mainly because it features Bohemian Rhapsody which was a hit at the time thanks to ""Wayne's World"") and I'll forever be glad I chose to listen to the entire disc because I never looked back. This is an essential purchase for anyone who wants to explore Queen a little deeper. You will NOT be sorry."
3,Some great songs,"This has some of Queen's greatest songs. However, it also has some songs are a big stretch to call, ""classic"" Queen. It's too bad they didn't take the classic songs on this CD and combine with the classic songs on ""Queen - Greatest Hits"" and leave the rest off (the hardcore fans who would like these songs have all their CDs anyway). One other point of contention with this CD is that the first part of the song, Tie Your Mother Down is not on this CD (you'll have to buy ""A Day At The Races"" to get the entire song). I don't know why they did this--if a song is on a CD, it ought to be the entire song. But that said, Bohemian Rhapsody, Stone Cold Crazy, and Keep Yourself Alive make this CD worth buying. Queen was truly one of the greatest rock bands."
4,Should've been 'Greatest hits 2'.,"To begin with, the tilte is a misnomer. This album is the American version of the 'Greatest hits 2', and songs of the 70's should not be included here. The result is a total confusion and inconsistency. 'Under pressure' sounds different from its original Parlophone version(because of bad remastering?). The only advantage of this album is the inclusion of 'days of our lives'."
2,Poor Package,"First off, Bohemian Rhapsody should not be here, it should be on 'Greatest Hits' with the bands other 70s rock classics. Aside from Rhapsody, this CD is just their 80s pop work, which was good but less inspired than their true 'classic' material. The inclusion of Bohemian Rhapsody on this collection was just a ploy by Hollywood to make it sell more records, because the other songs are practically unrecognizable here in the states, where Queen's popularity had faded by the time these songs were released. Get the 'Greatest Hits I & II' double-CD set, which features the original UK compilations."
4,I Want It All,Now as strong track for track as Greatest Hits but is largely a good summary of their later career with a couple of their most popular early songs thrown in. Bohemian Rhapsody never sounded better.
5,Queen........,"I think Queen is the best group in the world. nobody can be as them. freddie had really a heavenly voice. I'm sure he had gone to heaven. their the most beautiful songs are it's a hard life,show must go on,don't stop me now,don't try so hard,innuendo,mother law,spread your wings,one year of love,who wants to live forever,scandal...... Queen: it isn't a group and freddie is not a person like others....."
2,not what I thought I was getting,"I was a little disappointed, it was not the CD I expected. Condition of product was good would recommend if this is your kind of music"
1,Get Queen Greatest Hits I II and III instead of this CD,"Hollywood Records decides to ruin the great song ""The Miracle"" by editing it (that is, cutting 30 seconds of it) which essentially ruins the whole purpose of the song. Plus, it has such hits that are on Queen Greatest Hits II such as ""Innuendo"" (the best song Queen has ever made), ""It's A Hard Life"", ""Breakthru"", ""The Invisible Man"", and ""Friends will be Friends"" which as a whole are much better than the Classic Queen selection of ""Stone Cold Crazy"" ""One Year of Love"" ""Tie Your Mother Down"" and ""Keep Yourself Alive""Essentially this is Hollywood Records ruining the great works of Queen and their overall ignorance when it comes to selecting Classic songs."
5,Queen Lives!!!!!!!,"I am 13 and I am a huge Queen fan, Classic Queen is a lot better that Queen's Greatest Hits. I have them both and they are the best collection of recordings ever."
5,Queen rocks !!!!!!!,"This CD was well put together. Freddie Mercury does wonderful on this CD. Roger Taylor does beautiful on the drums, Brian May playing the guitar is unbelievable, and John Deacon playing bass will make you want more. All four band members show their best in the beautiful hit ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and Freddie does wonderful on ""The Show Must Go On."" This CD is pure greatness."
2,Too Violent,"All of these videos are too violent. They can't stop on a good note, they all have to go too far and end on a bad/ violent note."
4,wolf socks,"This is another product I bought for my son. I don't really get the fascination myself. I mean, they are neat looking and the artwork involved is nice, but, really, how many people are going to look at your socks? Still, it's what he wanted and he was very happy with them."
5,Highly recomended !!!!,"I enjoy Stalker's writing style and the topic of our Lord's Trial and Death are well worth spending time with a devotional of this quality. Through this book, I have a better appreciation for the events occurring between Gethsemane and the Cross. It provides a good foundation for further studies. Thanks and God Bless !!"
5,Thank you for sending a nice book,"I got to know Sofya Kovalevskaya from my friend a few months ago and I also knew she had got the great accomplishment in mathematical analysis. So, I wanted to buy the book about her.I usually bought a new book instead of a used book.But it was very hard to buy a new one in Korea and even in amazon USA. That's why I visited amazon UK. Fortunately I found `EliteDigital UK' selling a new and good-price book.I ordered it and I received it relatively quickly considering it was a third-party seller.I was fully satisfactory with this book which had an interesting history about her, and the quality of the book was very good."
4,Lost interest quick,"This was a Christmas present for a 1st grader. She really enjoyed it at first, but quickly lost interest. For the price there are not enough parts, limiting what can be built. Hopefully she will gain new interest with them after they sit for a while."
2,A little bit of mystery; a lot of whining.,"What happened to the person who wrote ""The James Joyce Murder?""I can forgive Ms. Fansler for the more obscure literary references, which tend to bore the non- literature scholars, but 212 pages of whining about the plight of women! Only the choir would listen to that sermon."
3,Java for CL,"Not for those who already know Java, this book gives non-Javaprogrammers with an interest in corpus linguistics an overview of what Java has to offer.Its not a useful book for non-programmers or those who don't know anything about corpus linguistics either.This could be used as a companion book for an undergraduate class in corpus linguistics.I refer to it occasionally when I need to do something in Java."
1,Not for anyone with programming experience,"I had expected this book to contain more practical implementations than it does. It's a confusing book primarily because it doesn't seem to know who its target audience is. As written, the book is going to be too basic for anyone with a programming background, and too complex for corpus linguists unfamiliar with programming concepts. It claims to be suitable for both, but programmers will find much better references to stemming and corpus creation in other sources (e.g. the Jurafsky/Martin book) and corpus linguists would be better advised to pick up a basic book on programming if that's what they're interested in learning."
5,Great product & fast accurate delivery,I got exactly what I ordered. It arrived in perfect condition & very quickly (DFW Tx address). This is a great leave in condition for people with dry curly hair. It won't take the curl out of your hair it leaves it soft & shiny & reduces the frizzies.
4,It fills in the gaps,"Though a little expendable, this is still a fairly good collection of adult contemporary tunes featuring several hard to find tracks and spanning two and a half decades. The track listing attests that soft rock flourished mainly in the '70s as no less than 22 of the album's 30 tracks are from that decade alone. In the following decades, it took a back seat to other genres as well as MTV. The first disc runs just under 57 minutes and the second 62 minutes so a few more tracks could have been added but that's a very minor complaint.If you love soft rock or adult contemporary music then you'll have no trouble enjoying this collection."
4,Wanting More,"Russ Martin generates a world where evil manifests itself to catch the unwary and beautiful into a life of sexual and demonic slavery, while likewise tempting the hero with similar ploys. The ending leaves the reader wondering what the ""devil"" comes next. Martin's vivid imagination is unmatched by other writers."
1,Never Got My Order,"I ordered this in plenty of time for Christmas & got a shipping notice of something like 10-15 business days. When I contacted them after that time period, they said it was backordered. I said I still wanted the order. After having to contact them yet another time, they said I would have it Feb 5 - 7. I still don't have it. They do not reply to emails. One time I called it just rang & rang. Another time I did get through; that was when they said it would be Feb 5 - 7. I give up. I'm not fussing with them anymore."
3,Not for everybody,"I bought this pillow for a backpacking trip through Europe. The pillow itself was ok but not great. The micro bead filling is a good concept, but the thickness of the pillow made it uncomfortable, especially when laying back into the seat. Its bulk makes it difficult to carry around if you're backpacking or taking just a small piece of luggage with you."
2,Squishy but unsupportive,"I was hoping to finally get some relief on long 6 hour plane rides with this neck pillow but i spend most of my time adjusting it and still getting a stiff neck from sleeping with it on the plane, and lugging it around the airport is a waste as well.wish it was thicker and tougher."
3,Its OK for lighter things,this box was described as being Galvanized. The sides are. Not the tops or the bottoms of the boxes. So when i recieved it the bottom was all busted out of it. After some reinforcing of the box it has been a good box. Just think for the price of the thing it could of been a little stronger then it was. It is great for home use.
1,rolling workshop,"I was so excited I finally found the tool box I really wanted.,.It was delivered twice and twice they arrived broken..So much for the perfect tool box.."
3,Good for Techs,"Nice box for my uses as electronic tech. Not exactly the sturdiest thing. Arrived from Amazon with a wheel broken off. Immediately replaced both with craftsman mechanics toolbox wheels. Drawers are great for connectors and boxes hold just enough other tools for most other circumstances. Overall, not bad for the price."
3,"If you are not philosophical, DO NOT READ...","I read this book for a philosophy of history class as a student at college. If you do not like philosophy and are easily distracted when reading mind-numbing abstractions then do not pick up this book. The thesis, or point, of the chapters are convoluted and seem to meander everywhere. I could read a chapter twice and still not have a clue what the author was saying. I can't comment on how persuasive his arguements are because I'm still not sure what he is saying. If you like philosophy then this book is for you becuase the author launches off into a universe of abstractions and shades that make one go insane, thus the title of his book."
1,"To write the ""History of Madness"" is to be mad itself","The book became the leading voice of the anti-bourgeoisie hegemony in the times of Foucault. It was almost a bible for some those who styled their lives with regard to the story of Pierre Riviera who murdered his mother, brother and sister. It became the voice of the underground socialist intellectuals. It was a tool of the left-wing. The psychiatric establishment of the time attacked Foucault with most harsh diatribe.Trueman Myaka Tel:(031) 3036466"
4,Defining madness is a subjective thing...,"When I first saw the book's title, I imagined it would be a book about psychiatric hospitals and many psychopaths' stories.I was wrong.It is much more than just that.Madness and civilization, is a book that explores the history of mental illness and how it was defined since the 16th century.The book takes to through history and reveals a story not known to most.How the first considered crazy people were thieves and homeless people, then leapers, and slowly it became what it is today.Though very interesting, the book is also a bit hard too read. it is a book that gives a lot of knowledge, but not a lot of plot. So unless you are looking to learn about the historical p.o.v of madness, do not take it.However, if you are, you will not regret it."
4,good beginner harmonica,"This was for my 3 1/2 year old son who took to it right away. He had an all plastic one that didn't work very well. This one works great and sounds awesome! The middle is not wood, but that's okay, as my son seems to leave behind a lot of spit, when he blows into it! I think if it was wood, it might rot with all of the saliva he leaves behind!"
4,Good for what it is and what it cost,"This is my first harmonica. I know very little if anything at all about harmonicas. I had to watch YouTube videos on how to hold the damn thing.. But!It's really fun once you start understanding on these things work. I'm writing this review based on my limited knowledge and being a first time user.I bought this harmonica specifically to play ""Mary Janes Last Dance"" by Tom Petty. Upon receiving the harmonica and watching a few videos on how to play it, I began to learn the harmonica parts to the song. It's really cool to actually play recognizable music out of one of these rather than just randomly blowing through it like you did as a kid.PROS:-Feels Sturdy-Has screws to take it a part and clean it-Gets the job done for a beginner harmonicaCONS:-No case included, only the flimsy card board box-The tone sounds kind of cheap but that may be just attributed to me being a novice"
1,Harmonica Blues,"They sound halfway decent for the first day or so, then they go flat. Alright for a use once and throw away $2.00 harmonica."
3,Not a bad harp,"I got this harp as a novice, i've never heard of the company before and its not a well known company in the harmonica circles. I would put this on par with most other entry level harmonica's, its better than my bluesband by hohner, i would put it in the same catagory as the old standby or the pocket pal harmonicas by hohner. Though those usually come with better cases. I will say that mine is very good for bending and it was what I learned to bend on."
4,Good Harp,I'm a starter Harmonica player so I got this one just to screw around with. It's a lot of fun! It fits perfectly in my pocket and its got a nice sound to it. I give it 4 not five because it comes with a paper case not any sort of protection. It's durable but it has no protection so be careful.
1,It's a toy,"This one is a toy, but might be enough in that regard to satisfy a kid's need to tootle.If you wanna play the Chicago Blues (or any kind of real music) you're gonna need a Hohner Special 20 (at least)."
2,Good News. Bad News.,"Good News: Dr. Rowe makes new and useful distinctions on the four demensions of creative intelligence. Bad New: the book is missing the answer key to the Creative Intelligence Profile, which is the heart and value of the book rendering the profile useless. Too bad interesting tool. And attempts to reach out to Dr. Rowe go unanswered."
3,Nice Short Stories,"I really enjoyed the first story, ""Big Daddy"" as I could not put it down. The rest of the stories are okay but not as great as the first. ""No Mercy"" is another good one that shows you that payback and karma are something else! But, all in all, I enjoyed reading the new stories by up and coming authors. Nikki Turner was real crafty putting this compilation together. Although Nikki's tale, ""Gotta Have A Ruffneck"" was a little unrealistic, I bet she will continue the story later on in another project."
2,Thought it would be betta,Well let me start off by sayin the lst story to me was nasty as hell and afta finshing up the 1st story i threw the book down in disgust i mean cum on it was just disgusting! I mean i liked the story line but the sex scenes were jus ewwwwww
3,Hood Novel Fans Can Rejoice... until page 59.,"This book is great until the 1st short story is over. I read it within an hour and I found my self wishing I had the full Novel of ""Big Daddy"". Regardless of the circumstances regarding the main character of the 1st story, this was a well executed true to form hood tale. Although some may say this novel can be too graphic at times, I would think only an idiot would pick up such a novel and expect roses and glitter. It's raunchy, raw, unadulterated, and at times exceptional, especially considering the low-rent hood books more commonly available. I would definately read if the ""Hood"" book genre appeals to you... and please, give Big Daddy a chance.... her story is moving nonetheless."
2,Wasn't what I expected,The First story Big Daddy was great i couldn't stop reading that one but after that i couldn't get into them like that anymore. I mean it was kind of interesting but i just couldn't get into it like i thought i would
3,Tales from the Hood,i thought this book was ok. I really liked some of the stories and think they should be made into novels. I think Big Daddy was stretched out and boring....other that that Nikki Turner did good when she Published this book!!!Can't wait for her next novel!!
3,Sistagaal from GAAL-Atlanta,"Wow, this book was way more that I bargained for. Not your typical book at all. Street Chronicles was full of raw, urban drama from the first story-""Big Daddy"" to the very end. Very good read if you are interested in something other than a nice suburban love story with a happy ending."
2,Ok reference; too much math,"This book is very mathematically rigorous, often at the expense of physical clarity. However, it is a good reference for the mechanics of calculations because if often gives the route to obtaining the results. Since it's available for free online (see below for the website), it's worth downloading, just to have in case you need to refer to it, but I wouldn't use it to learn from. You're better off using:Grosberg and Khokhlov: Statistical Physics of Macromoleculesde Gennes: Scaling Concepts in Polymer PhysicsDoi and Edwards: The Theory of Polymer Dynamics..."
5,Classic Hughes!,"A must read for anyone interested in the Harlem Renaissance, race, and 20th C African American literature. Hughes' pacing makes it almost impossible to put down."
5,My new hero,"I have learned so much Black history that I have not enjoyed since reading ""Mis-Education of the Negro"" by Dr. Carter G. Woodson. In my opinion, Mr. Hughes takes up where Dr. Woodson left off. The two books go together like peaches and cream.BW of Maryland"
3,travels with Langston,Langston hughes presents us with his travels. This is not a great book nor it a bad book. It falls in between the scope of what happens to a guy when he goes around the world and mets people.
3,okay game,"It's an okay game, but not as fun as I had hoped. It's not all that challenging and is repetitive when you play it multiple times. I love the company who makes this game, so whas expecting more. I've only played it with 2 people - may be better with more?"
5,Shipment,"As always, I get rapid shipment of anything I purchase through Amazon. I am very pleased with the product."
1,Terrible zipper,"This is the 3rd time I will be buying a replacement bag. The zippers are plastic and terrible. The blower works fine, but it's just the darn leaf bag that keeps breaking. I think this is the last time I will purchase this product."
1,Leaf Bag Gone Bad,This product states it fits all Black & Decker blowers/vacuums... not true! At least I found that it does not fit the LH4500 model and had to return it.
1,so unhappy,Used bag twice and the seam on top ripped open and dirt and leaves came flying at me. The original bag with the black and decker was a touch better. Got at least one summer before same thing. There has to be a bag out there that will be sturdier. It's ridiculous.
3,Blowin' in the wind,"We needed to replace the bag on our Black&Decker vacuum/mulcher so ordered this one. If you don't mind the bag coming disconnected from the apparatus, then this is the bag for you. It didn't always remain attached while we were doing the yard work. Certainly someone at B&D's suppliers can figure out how to get the bag to stay attached while vacuuming the leaves. We did appreciate the zippered end; seemed easier to use than the former bag we had."
1,a substitute,I was sent this collection bag as a substitute for the Weedeater blower I own. It was not at all compatible so had to return it.
1,Not correct bag for L4500,This bag was sold as the replacement bag for the Leaf Hog LH4500. This is not the correct bag as it has the incorrect connector type. The online specifications do not show this. The LH4500 needs a Type 1 connector.
1,Item Not As Pictured,"This replacement collection bag is not as pictured in the photo. In fact it is exactly the same as the original bag and is shown as a re-design, much improved over the original. I followed directions to return it and when i printed out the return label it indicates THAT I HAVE TO PAY POSTAGE to return an item that was misrepresented in the photo and is NOT what I ordered !At least Amazon should pay the return postage when the item is not as advertised."
1,FIX IT YOURSELF,"Had an area in the bag wear through so I used those old iron-on patches, one on the inside, then one on the outside. So far so good"
4,Seems to fit the bill,"The original bag ripped after a season. Finally broke down and bought this replacement that is supposed to fit my unit. Well, it kinda-sorta does. The ""nozzle"" slides over spout on the blower, but it holds by friction only. Bit stiff to put on and off...not real easy considering how often you have to remove it to empty the filled bag (almost impossible to try and empty it while it is still attached). The bag seems to be sturdy enough, so I don't anticipate any problems...then again, I thought the original bag looked sturdy. The price seemed to have come down to within reason when I finally broke down and purchased it. Can't recall the numbers exactly right now, but it seems when I looked this up a year ago the price was high enough I just decided to do without."
1,Doesn't Do the Job,Bought this thinking it looked like a good replacement ... wrong! I'd like to return it but there was no return label on the package. Anyone want to buy a new bag at a discount?!
1,Does not work!,"Cannot give a rating to a ""tool"" that does not work! That's right, despite having the SAME model as is indicated on the website, the plastic connector that is supposed to fit over the chute from the vacuum mine does not. I think that after they sold the units it was realized that the bags are next to impossible to remove to empty and improved on it. The only way I would find that out would be to go to Lowe's and buy a new one. So instead, I have Elmer's glued a patch of muslin over the hole that developed from the leaves shooting into the bag. In addition, I slipped in a piece of plastic from a container to reinforce it. So far, working, but the season is not over and there are a lot of leaves out there calling my name. Sorry, with it not working, cannot give it a good rating."
3,bag needs engineering upgrade,"this is my third bag in 3 years. in the intake area a flap was designed to take the abuse of sticks and small rocks however, the flap goes from side to side instead of from front to back (along the seam)therefore the bag continues to blow out at the rear seam after only 3 or 4 months of use"
1,Buyer Beware!!,"Despite B&D's claims, this bag most certainly does NOT fit all their vacuum/blowers. It did not fit on mine, and I had to hold it on with my left hand to keep it from blowing off and use the vaccum with my right--very uncomfortable. Got wise and bought the Toro $69 blower/vacuum on Amazon and got the free shipping and it still arrived in four days. I like it MUCH better than the Black & Decker version--it is MUCH quieter."
1,Not what the picture shows,When it arrived it was the wrong bag. the connector was on the top. not on the side as the picture shows. I needed the connector on the side. The company said the connector on the top is the only one they do. I was very disappointed.
1,Misfit for LH4500,My original bag zipper finally broke. I ordered 2 of these replacement bags to fit my Leaf Hog. The plastic collar does not fit the machine. It it too tight and does not have the fittings to slide over the spring button on my Leaf Hog. I'm very disappointed. I don't understand why it is listed as a compatible part for the Black and Decker LH4500.
3,bagger bag zipper,The zippers are junk. I go threw 2 bags a year because the zipper do not last. Stuck buying these because the vac works great.
1,This solution worked for me.,"After reading the reviews on this site, I figured there had to be a better solution than throwing money away on another bag. I went to my local craft store and purchased a package of velcro (for $3.19). It contained both sides of velcro and you secure it to fabric using a steam iron. Without removing the old zipper, I vacuumed the inside of the bag and ironed the velcro in place. To my surprise it worked. I have used it three times now and it works flawlessly. Interestingly, the velcro ""opens"" up to release pressure when it can't take anymore.I also used WD40 to lube the connection of the bag to the motor housing.These two fixes have salvaged what would have been a totally useless device.Hope that helps."
1,B&D Leaf Hog Really Blows,"I'm an unfortunate owner of a B&D; Leaf Hog & also have problems with that miserable collection bag. The zipper on mine is fine but one of the two cheap plastic tabs in the collar broke almost immediately (rendering the bag useless). I wasted my time jury rigging a screw/nut to replace the broken tab. I now get about 30 seconds of run-time before the bag blasts off. I also, like one of the other reviewers, purchased their hose for a trashcan and it's as sad as their collection bag.Do yourself a favor & buy a higher-end Toro unit."
3,B&D BV-005 Blower/Vacuum replacement shoulder bag,"The replacement bag is smaller than the original. The zipper placement has been moved around the edge of the bag. This makes it more difficult to empty. The zipper is still made of plastic. I do not expect it to stand up to a force five hurricane for more than a year. The first bag exploded at the zipper two months after I bought the blower. Even with household oil it is difficult to open and close for empting once the seam separates. I highly recommend new users invert the bag, close the zipper as best you can and wash it before using it. And yes, dry it also on medium heat. This will help ""set"" the zipper to reduce its tendency to blow apart."
1,DEFECTIVE LEAF COLLECTION BAG,"The second time I used the leasf collection bag,the zipper ripped-apart.I NEED ANOTHER BAG SHIPPED ASAP."
2,""" If the bag doesn't fit """,The bag looks and IS a cheap imitation of the original. It's Much smaller AND DoesNOT fit the tightening fitting properly. As a result you CAN NOT position the bagcomfortably. Very dissapointing.
3,Black & Decker Collection Bab,These bags work well with a few reservations. The last one I purchased did not have the canvas material properly trimmed around the plastic connector and therefore it would sometimes be very difficult to remove it if the canvas got caught in the plastic connector. They also need to put an industrial strength zipper on the bag. The one they use looks more like the type used on a pair of ladies shorts. The zipper on my last one tore loose at one end and in the middle as well. I was able so use the last replacement bag I purchased but it was a lot more trouble to work with than the original bag thet came with my blower due to the problems mentioned above.
3,B&D collection bag BV-005,"Do not buy this bag. Seller claims it fits all B&D; blower/vacs. It does not. It does not have the B&D; snap lock fitting so it does not lock in place. Needs a different fitting.Update: I discovered that the inlet flange was held on by two cable ties and that I could replace the fitting on this bag with the fitting from the old bag. I am now using the new bag, so I did not return it. If you still have your old bag you can use this bag with the LH4500 and 5000 otherwise not."
4,Leaf Bag,"Good product, works well with the B/D leaf vacuum. This bag is much more difficult to take off the nozzle than the previous one."
3,overpriced under-designed,no problems as far as it fitting my current leaf blower but i wish it would last a little longer. the constant beating it takes from small branches and other things being inhaled eventually wears out the fabric and eventually a hole appears and from then on out it's downhill from there.. If it only cost about $9.00 to replace I wouldn't mind so much but at $24.00 it adds up when you go through a few of them over the lifetime of the blower........
4,Good,"This bag is a great replacement for the one my dog chewed up. It doesn't fit as well as the original or clip on like the original, but it's so tight that you don't have to worry about the clip."
3,Black & Decker Replacement Collection Bag,"I haven't yet utilized the bag, but my first thought was, ""Why in the world would you make a leaf collection bag white?"" Fabric seems a bit thin, as my old bag was canvas."
1,Picture is misleading,"This bag looks identical to the one I have, but as it turns out isn't. The opening is on the top instead of the side as shown and has a different connection. It would have been nice to know before ordering that I would need an adapter to make it connect, but even then I would have returned it because the placement of the opening makes it impossible to use with my B&D blower/vac. I didn't even get a chance to judge the quality of the bag. After reading the comments (something I should have done first), I'm glad I'm sending it back."
1,"Believe the reviews, this is poor quality","These reviews are correct. I used mine vacuum for one season and the zipper gave out on the bag. Tried to find another locally and nobody (Home Depot, Lowes, Sears) seems to stock it. Poor quality from Black and Decker."
1,Same zipper problem with bag,I guess then I will have to order more than one bag to replace the replacement bag when it too breaks prematurely.
2,Awkward & Not Particularly Durable,The way the bag hangs on the vacuum is awkward for the operator. The zippers on these bags are not very durable and I have had two fall apart. I'm stuck with the vacuum and therefore the not particularly durable bag. Look at alternative configurations.
1,This Bag is of poor quality.,This bag (for which it is designed) should have been of better quality. I had two bags. One was a warranty replacement ofr the blower. Both the bags have issues. For one the zipper gave out.The other the Threading on the sides developed holes after a couple of uses.Make the Vaccum part of the Blower completely useless. I also had the attachement with the Leaves go directly into the Trash can.... That was completely useless as well. The hose is very heavy and keeps tripping the Trashcan. Once I put weight in the can.. The hose got ripped from the bag.... Could not find a better way to put my money down the drain...
1,black&decker bv-005 shoulder bag,"zipper on these bags do not hold up,unit is very unconfortable to use.i'am stuck with this blower/vacum untill the motor gives out."
3,Buyer Beware,"The product information on the website states that the bag ""fits all Black& Decker blower/vacuums,"" and ""Replaces all Black & Decker blower vac bags."" So I ordered two bags for my B&D; LH4500 Leaf Hog Blower/Vacuum. When the bags arrived, I learned from the information on the package that the collection bags only work for the smaller models, such as the BV2500. I had no way of knowing this from the description and reviews on the website, although I see that now it is billed as the ""Replacement shoulder bag for BV-2500."" Fortunately, the return was easy.By the way, the leaf collection system BV-006 is a piece of junk. It did not take long for the plastic coupler to detach from the hose."
1,defective bags,the zipper does not hold upThe fabric all ready has holes in it after 1 month useHad to buy a different bag already it is cheper to by a bag than a blower
5,Excellent,"A wonderful and sensitive story about racism. A quick and insightful read. Deals with a childhood actress and her overdominating mother who has many secrets of her own. When Miranda discovers her mother's damaging past, she needs to deal with the implications of the past on her life. Just a wonderful story and highly recommended."
2,Great concept...needs much improvement,"First, let me start by saying that delivery took extremely long and that should not be . I needed something to help my son keep his room neat and tidy and I thought that this would help. It helped for about a minute. The concept of this unit is grand; however, it is not holding up to the demands of what it claims it can hold. I have a 19 inch TV, a VCR, GameCube, Nintendo 64, 10 VHS tapes and a few gamecube games and the unit is leaning to the side. The drawers are not closing like they should. I don't like the idea of having to drill nails straight through the plastic shelves in order to connect them to the sides of the unit. The plastic is the only thing that is sturdy, but, what good does that do you when the assembled unit is weak when it is holding the very things it was meant to hold. I have to return this to the store. It is just not worth the money I paid for it."
1,OK PRODUCT BUT NEEDS SOME WORK,"I just purchased this deluxe video center for my son and I have to say for the price I paid I am extremely disappointed with it. First of all when I received it the box it came in was nearly destroyed. It was so torn up I am suprised it got here at all and I was suprised nothing feel out and everything was in the box. Everything was so dirty from the box I had to wash everything before putting it together. Second, it isn't that sturdy. The sides wobble a whole lot and the shelfs also wobble and I followed the directions exaclty. I even used extra screws I had to try to make it more sturdy. Third it doesn't hold nearly all the tapes it says it will. If my son didn't like it so much and the company I purchased it from wouldn't charge a restocking fee I would send it back. The video center is a great idea and looks great in photos but after getting it, it still needs alot of work. I wouldn't waiste my money on this again."
4,Great Idea buts needs improvement,I bought three of these units and was impressed with the construction and ease of putting them together. I think the concept of this product is fantastic but the drawers are a little hard to get in and out. I used some lubricant to oil the drawers and it seemed to help. I have not noticed any sagging with the product as spoke about in the previous ratings. Price needs adjusting down some but overall i give it a good rating.
1,Dissatisfied,"I was very dissatisfied with this item. First, the plastic parts are very bulky and gaudy. Second, the parts were scratched up and worn. Third, some of the screws and screw caps are missing. The thing is so bulky, that I'm not even interested in knowing how much it would cost to return. It sits in my son's room still incompletly assembled. I decided to just write it off as a loss. [...] In essence, this product is garbage. Don't waste your money. Don't be fooled. This product doesn't even deserve one star. However Amazon makes it mandatory for you to give it atleast a one."
1,obsolete product lower the price,"the kind of television this product holds isn't even sold anymore and completely obsolete! why on earth is it so crazily expensive?? i regret even looking at it, i didn't buy it and i wouldn't, from what the reviews says it's not really worth the money."
1,I can't open the drawers!!!!,I put my video game systems in it and now the drawers won't open. I've been trying to get them open for a week and it's like they are locked or something.It got so bad I just threw the whole thing away with my game systems still inside.Don't buy this device.
5,One of the Greatest Jazz Albums Ever,"I love jazz. I like listening to many other musical genres but jazz has always been my favorite art form. I was devastated when all of my LP's were ruined by water damage. This album was one of the greatest jazz recordings of my time and I missed it terribly.Digital remastering is the greatest thing to happen to music, in my opinion. Now I can hear ALL of the music, not as one mixed sound but every crash of a cymbal, every beat of the bass. It's like rediscovering all of my favorite artists (Lee Morgan, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, to name just a few.)What else is there to say? This remastered album is outstanding and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates jazz and anyone who enjoys music as art."
4,Protect Your DS,"Excellent case for storing your adapter, games and DS, yet compact enough to carry without taking up much space."
2,Things to deal with every day,"THERE SEEMS TO BE THE SAME THINGS ONE DEALS WITH ON A DAILY BASIS TO WICH WE SEEM TO COME BACK TO OVER AND OVER, STEPHEN TELLS ME THE VERY SMALL THINGS IN A BIG WAY, HOW TO SEE, AND DEAL WITH THESE SMALL NUGGETS OF ADVICE I CAN DEAL WITH EVERYDAY."
4,Memorable Portrayal of Valentine's History,"I saw this film probably 13 years ago at an evening church service. It was an interesting portrayal of the times that Valentine lived and the possible story that arose out of his legend. It is very enjoyable and moves along at a good pace. I don't recall the time-travel portion of the plot mentioned in all the descriptions; mostly the story surrounding Valentine in prison and his interaction with a young girl, resulting in the first ""valentine"" and how she was touched by the love of God in his life. This is a faith-based portrayal which is very decently done. It made such an impression on me that all these years later I have ordered it for my own family. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy re-enactments and history, and if you can obtain it for a discount, all the better."
4,A very good movie!,"My family and I really enjoyed watching this movie; the story of St. Valentine was portrayed there quite well. It will help us all to remember the real meaning of St. Valentine's day!There were a few minor technical problems with video, a few short glitches during the movie."
4,"Quality, Inexpensive Puppets","I bought several puppets for my grandson at Christmas. He was so excited when he opened them. I used to teach a puppet ministry at our church and we used similar puppets but larger. Then we began making similar puppets (like ""muppets"") due to the high cost and they were time consuming to create. They were also only able to be used by teens and adults. So to find these little guys for my 5 yr old grandson was GREAT. Good product."
3,disappointed bladesmith,"this was a very important book for me to read, unfortunately 99% of it was useless information, and the only measurements that it gave on any blades was the length. it did however show hundreds of pictures of swords ranging from the early vikings and romans through the renaissance (until the hilts became the complex ""works of art"" instead of the utilitarian crosses).it also explained how a sword was almost impossible to date simply by its blade and/or hilt form, and that there was almost no pattern to the choice of cross/pommel/blade form. good info for a budding medieval bladesmith or collector."
4,Hilts and guards,"Many interesting and useful illustrations, especially of hilts and guards. There are other books which cover some of the same material, but the author is well known for his work in this area and so the quality as a reference source is excellent."
3,Beautiful to look at,"I recommend this book if you are a fan of Tony Harris' art especially -- this work really marks the shift from the style he used on Starman to his current Ex Machina visuals. While the story isn't bad, it's in no way exceptional and I wouldn't recommend it on those merits. An interesting creator owned project from a very gifted penciler."
4,Great for Little Ones,"This is great for little ones. It says 3+ but my 2 year old loves it and it is the perfect height for her. I don't think set this will last more than a few years for her. I am sure she will out grow it quickly. But for now, she loves to do laundry in her Rose Petal Cottage!"
4,Great Toy Washer,"My daughter wanted a washing machine. She pretends to wash American Girl clothes. A great extension for pretend play. Maybe someday she'll do real laundry! It is reasonably made, no problems putting together or being too fragile. Terrific! She is 6 and it is a little small and looks a little babyish vs. a very realistic one that I saw in a catalog but it is fine especially for the price."
4,daughter was elated - husband thought it was a dryer!,"My daughter saw the Amazon box on the table and jumped for joy! She loves playing in the cottage she got for Christmas and has been waiting for the accessories to arrive one by one (why oh why didn't I get them back in November, too?) Well, this is the first one she has received, and she loves playing with it in her cottage. I think it is overpriced, even at suggested retail value, but what fun! She has ""washed"" everything including her stuffed animals. I wish the washer would turn or something, but she just uses her imagination. Fortunately her grandma just got a real front-loader so she knows it is a washer. FYI -- you wouldn't want the cottage appliances to be any larger -- Mama can barely get in there already, and that's before we have the sink!"
2,Washer,"I thought that this product could have been made more durable, however it is not. However, it was easy to assemble, and my daughter does play with it from time to time."
2,Save your pennies; buy the newer edition,"This would appear to be the older edition of this title. The newer (2nd) English language edition of pt. 2 of the 4-part Bikeline Danube series has a copyright of c.2003-2006. You could probably still use this older edition, but it is now almost 10 years old, so buyer beware!"
4,fire dept. vehicles,great set. my son loves the fire dept and loves playing with these vehicles. good quality and great price. pleasure doing business.
2,Car,I bought 2 gift packs for a couple of 2 year old's. It was shipped out very quickly. The cars look very cute but don't waste your money. All the plastic parts broke off the first time the boys played with them. The parts are also tiny and a coking hazard.
2,Breaks Easily,Not well-made. You get what you pay for is the lesson I learned here! My boys broke this toy the same day it came in the mail just with normal play.
3,These are not as good as Matchbox,I did not find these vehicles as sturdy as Matchbox vehicles. Our grandson liked them and doesn't know the difference.
5,This book will help you win a violent confrontation!,"If you carry a gun or are planning on doing so then this book is a must read. In his own voice Bryan Williams clearly explains what every gun owner or person interested in the safety and protection of themselves or others needs to know to win a violent confrontation! I highly recommend this book to everyone. I was not able to put the book down once I started reading it. Welcome to the Real world is filled with many useful techniques and stories based on the authors vast real life experiences as a former cop who won a medal for bravery in the line of duty. Also Bryan is able to draw upon his years of experience working in the private security and protective services and training countless civilians, law enforcement and military personel to win and not just survive!"
5,Wickedly Good!,"Product DescriptionA 2 Track CD-Single promoting ""Wicked"". Songs are ""Defying Gravity"" and ""For Good""."
5,BOX me in and PIN me down !,I have been using these quick release pins to hold a large storage box in the bed of my pickup truck. They have worked out great! The storage box is secured from theft and moving but with the push of a button I can quickly and easly remove it. BOX me in and PIN me down no one can steal me and I won't move around.
1,Stay away,"Very pretty, and you think you can't go wrong for the price. Not so. The stud broke off from the post the first time I wore them. Also, with shipping hovering around $5, think twice."
5,Wonderful Knife Bag,"I love this bag!Expertly sown, made of high quality nylon.Room for all my knives and thermometers and a bottle opener.The only negative is its a little difficult to close when completely full."
3,"1st Time Great, 2nd Time Not So Much",I first read this when a young warrior and the book was relatively new. I thought it was great. Now I'm an old retired warrior and it just doesn;t hang together for me. I don't think I'll make it all the way theu it again.
1,Bring your sharpener,"Unfortunately, for such a handy product, the sharpness of the blades does not last beyond a few uses. Even filing the blades to re-sharpen them does not work. Be prepared to replace the blades often, which are not cheap. It's a shame the quality of the blades is so poor--probably the cheap metal used--because it damages the reputation of Black and Decker."
4,Black and Decker grass shears,"This has been a great product. Haven't had to replace the blades yet but if they are as good as the orginal blades, I'll be using the shears for quite some time."
5,Perfect fit replacement,"This is a perfect replacement for the battery operated grass clipper. It arrived quickly, well packed and fit perfectly. What more could anyone require?"
5,Black & Decker Replacement Blade RB-001,"I purchased the item if needed to replace the original set in one of my new Black & Decker Shears which are operating just great. Thanks for the prompt delivery, will do more business with Amszon in the near future"
4,B&D Grass Shear Blade Replacement,"Needed to replace my wornout blades. Could not find in local stores. Found on Amazon, reasonably priced. Delivered timely. Good service."
1,Tarzan Who?,This is the worst Tarsan movie I've ever seen. The Tarzan yell sounds more like a hog calling contest. The acting isn't just bad it's totally rotten. Tarzan attacks no less than three and more than six men at a time by himself which is a bit farfetched. This is truly and injustice to the writer of the tarzan stories
3,"Easy to read, but superficial","This might be a good book for IT managers, it is quite convincing when it comes to deciding whether to use components and frameworks or not. However, for a developer it is not very helpful. Although it contains sound ideas on how to compare different frameworks.Still, plenty of people nowadays are using servlets to output HTML or JSP to request a database, and this book helps to understand that there are much more powerful and efficient tools available in Java Web world."
3,Pacifier,"I was pleased with the shipment, price, and quality of the product. I wish it would've come with something to hang it, that would make things easier"
4,Highly Original Comedy,"At the very least you can say that the makers of ""A Fine Madness"" attempt something different. That's not to say they hit a bulls-eye,though. Their ambitions are higher than their success rate. They attempt to skewer the artistic mindset and the psychiatric profession but the humor in part is too manic to truly succeed. That said there are enough laughs here to give the film a qualified recommendation. Sean Connery is inspired as the poet disguised as a brawling, boozing, womanizing, blue-collar guy. Or is it vice versa? Joanne Woodward is Connery's match as his supportive long-suffering wife. There are any number of amusing setpieces here: Connery dressing down the ladies' auxiliary, Connery's confrontation's with the process server(John Fiedler, ""Mr. Peterson"" from the old ""Bob Newhart"" show), Connery playing the psychiatrist recordings of an unfaithful wife to her unsuspecting husband. A mixed bag, but give this film credit for aiming high and just missing the mark."
3,Not what I expected,"Made in 1966. The film depicts several aspects of that eras norms. If one considers cheating husband, spousal abuse, unethical psychiatric practices, and labotomy not entertainment then then movie is not for you."
5,A hidden cult movie !,"Sean Connery played hard and won with this delicious , ironic and bitter comedy about a poet in the middle of a crisis .The script is full of surprises and the presence of Joanne Woodward make of this film of Milton Katselas a collector item .If you want to make an original present to someone you love, try with this . It impossible for you to fail ."
1,BOR - - - ING!,An unemployed (and unemployable) poet supported by his waitress girlfriend. Need I say more?
3,Great for the price,Comes exactly as shown. Box is not fancy but good enough for a gift. It will make a nice gift. Satisfied.
4,Rating on behalf of 2 teen girls,My girls have watched this movie more than twice. This is definitely a teen movie and the girls seem to love it. I'm sure it has a lot to do with watching Jesse Metcalfe on screen for a couple of hours.
1,TERRIBLE quality,"If I felt like wasting 3 dollars to ship this crappy, scratched up dvd, I would. I don't know if I'm in the 4% that got a crappy version of this dvd, but... Just know I was one of them. The dvd almost doesn't even work. I'm going to throw it out."
3,Review,Product arrived before due date. It was given as a gift and the person reported that the color was off.. not super impressed.
5,Excellent!!,"This is such a good movie! It keeps me laughing all the way through. I think that it is definitely a ""chick flick"" though. But ladies, if you need a good laugh, grab yourself a bowl of popcorn and pop it in the player. You'll be giggling in no time!"
4,A Hilarious Film!!!,"For a chick flick, this has a really good storyline and is very funny! I had seen it before, but it had been a while. I recorded it 4 days ago, and I finally finished it a few hours ago. Brittany Snow plays a high-schooler named Kate who has never had a boyfriend. While she's working at a restaurant, she sees John Tucker dating three beautiful girls at different times. They all find out, and with Kate's help, they get revenge on him by breaking his heart. If you love comedy, you'll love JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE!!!"
4,High School Revisted,"A Very cool High School movie Rag to Richies! Just fun fun fun. All high school groups are pretty well represented with a nifty thme of nailing the Super jock by his former Girlfriends. Another easy happy ending with cool acting , a nifty way to spend an hour and half.If you like this kind of movie this one deserves a place in your DVD collection."
2,John Tucker lives???,"Okay the person that puts this movie in the same category as ""Bring it on"", ""Clueless"", ""Mean Girls"" and, especially the superior ""Heathers"".. is painting a false picture of what this movie is.. I'm sorry but, ""John Tucker Must Die"" is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films. These other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers. ""JTMD"" appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all I did. This film tries taking a lot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one BIG mess. 2.5 stars is all I can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket. ""Heathers"" = 5 stars. ""Mean Girls"" = 4 stars. ""Bring it on"" = 4 stars. ""Clueless"" 4.5 stars. All four of these movies have something that ""John Tucker Must Die"" doesn't have.."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"OK, let me say this... John Tucker is no prize, neither is the guy who played him. They could have done so much more and found 1000 better actors to play him. It wasn't a bad movie. It would have been better had the actors actually been high school students and not mid-late 20s actors/actresses. The story was simple, the acting was decent, and it had its funny moment, I defiantly loved your fashion sense John haha. It's worth checking out, but far from Oscar worthy."
2,Liars,I like this movie and it works but the description of it was wrong. The disk was all scratched up when it said it wasn't going to be.
3,I laughed. (Not great but not bad.),"The movie is really exactly what it seems. Thin entertainment, yet entertaining. Some teen and highschool movies have been entertaining and had a real substance such as ""A Walk to Remember."" This was not that. This was more Loral and Hardy with teenage girls (fully clothed) and guys (in thongs). Many of the jokes were madly funny, and the actresses supported the jokes quite well with these rolls. The ending sort of meandered off like the screen-writer wasn't quite sure how to end. Not great but not bad."
3,Great Shape,John Tucker Must Die was everything I thought it would be and there wasn't even one scratch on it. So this is another wonderful success for amazon.com!
1,Boring!,"Ok, I tried to be open minded with this movie. I figured it had to be somewhat original and at least mildly entertaining. No dice. This movie was just boring. The plot is waaay to predictable and there is no realism anywhere. I don't expect a documentary, but come on!And mind you, I am amuzed fairly easily, and this movie just did not do it for me.I would say you save your money and watch for it on tv if you're still curious. Money saved."
1,um...,"same lame teen movie we've seen a million times. guy lies to girl so everyone can be happy, girl descovers lie, hilarity (suuuuuure) ensues. in the end, whatever."
3,"Mindless fun, but good for a transatlantic flight","I watched this movie on a plane, and I have to say, there are plenty of worse ways to spend 90 minutes. I'm 30, so I don't generally get into the teen movie scene, but Jesse Metcalf is so hot, I didn't even care about the story that much. And the story - such as it was - wasn't so bad. It was predictable, it was kind of funny, there were some hilarious scenes, but mostly it was kind of fluff. It *was* fun to watch girls banding together to get revenge, and watching the main character ""find herself"", and some of the pranks were very clever. The highlight, though, is the hotness of John Tucker himself. But I already said that."
2,BELOW PAR!,"First of all, before I upset people with this review, let me tell you that I am an adult. This movie was perfect for the young juveniles living in my house but not for anyone out of high school. I did not find it funny nor enjoyable. I just kept wishing it to be over. Different strokes for different generations I guess."
3,passable for what it was,"John Tucker Must Die was a surprise to me. Why? Because the movie didn't fall for the usual tricks that teenager movies normally do- immature violence, lots of dirty swear words, and sex. All those topics were surprisingly avoided and instead the writers opted to go for a much more acceptable and cleaner storyline. Did it work? Well, sort of.I have to agree with the reviewer who mentions the similarities to Saved By The Bell. It was pretty much just like that old TV show in every way. As a young adult, I'm happy my teenage years are over and don't want to think about the past and the way I used to be back then, so for people who are also in the same boat, you probably won't find anything about the movie to really win you over. You'll just think ""Oh yeah, I used to act like that"" and be done with it. In other words, this movie will only be funny to a teenager, and no one else will care.A decent movie for teenagers, but not the greatest film ever made, that's for sure."
3,Sophmoric Fun!,"Cute, funny, but predictable chick flick!Take three popular high school girls who are dating the hottest guy on campus at the same time, but know about it until later. The three girls decide to take revenge on this three timing guy and give him a taste of his own medicine."
2,Bingo Kids CD,I would not recommend purchasing this CD. Although Kudos to the Bingo Kids...they sound EXACTLY like the Beatles. So when I played it for my grandchildren it did nothing for them. They thought they where listening to the real Beatles CD's that their grandfather plays for them. I thought that this CD was going to be a bunch of kids signing songs not quite this professionally done.
1,My ears are bleeding,This may be the worst album I have ever heard. Kids mangling Beatles songs are not my idea of musical enjoyment. I would never let my children listen to this. Save your money and play your kids the original Beatles songs.
3,Not better than The Beatles,"The songs are supposedly sung by kids, but some of them are sung so similarly to the originals that it's hard to tell. Not that it's BAD that the songs are similar, it's just that, well, it's just not an improvement to the real Beatles, so why not just get a CD of the Beatles. I also bought Beatles 1 at the same time, and my 2 yr old loves listening to it. Get that instead."
4,This was a Christmas gift,I purchased the Black & Decker EB-007 Edger and extra blade as a Christmas gift to a family member and it hasn't been used as of yet. The pricing was the best that I had found and Black & Decker has made products for many years. The pricing value and name were the main reason for me buying.
5,Perfect Replacement,Needed a replacement blade for my 10 year old edger. This blade was inexpensive (via Amazon) and the right size for the model I own. It was easy to install and works great.
2,Very cheap,"Hole in center is not correct, cheap item...I would NOT Recomend....Item must be seconds quality from the dealer, as nothing was correct to the machine!"
2,"For edging, WORSE BLADE EVER","I just use my edger for edging the lawn by the sidewalk and driveway. This blade does NOT edge straight. It CHOPS and MUTILATES the grass instead of leaving a smooth straight line. Having gone from a straight edge blade to this blade was a HUGE downgrade as far as the quality of the cut goes. Also, the blade is short, and I have to put the edger on the lowest setting in order to get into the dirt where some grass is below the surface. Granted maybe this works best for digging or trenching but the blade is horrible, IMO, for straight edges.I since bought another straight (8"" Rectangle) blade and even though its not made for the machine, it fits, and works 10X better. I went back and re cut the edges straight so now the lawn doesnt look like chopped salad along the edges. Do yourself a favor and get the straight blade."
4,Black & Decker Edger Blade,I went to Sears to buy a new blade for my B&D edger and found out Sears is no longer carring B & D Edger equipment. New blade is exact as The original and works fine.
5,Great,"Excellent beans at a relatively low price, but did take quite awhile to arrive as they orginate overseas."
1,KANT WAS A NAZI,"this is so hard, its not even worth wile cuz kjant was a nazi and hitler luvd his stuff, so y shud u read a NAZI thats what i ask u??????? BAD BAD BAD.Initially published in the Journal of American Philosophy, 55(7), Sept. 2009."
4,a very practical book,"I have just received this book a few days after the colloquial chinese by Kan Qian. Both are very very practical. I am learning Tang Poems in traditional characters and a lot of people agree those are/were the best poems at all times. I wish they had both traditional and simplified characters side by side, otherwise I will spend a lot of time looking up the traditional-character dictionaries."
4,Comprehensive but easy to read,"I purchased this book as a requirement for my introduction to forensic science class, which I took in a summer session so it was really condensed. I am not a science buff, but I fully understood all of the concepts presented in the book. Although a little bulky the font is rather large so the reading goes relatively fast. There are quite a bit of illustrations to compound the information provided. But be warned...some of the illustrations are a little graphic in nature! The subject bares that fact. My only complaint is there is no electronic version of the book which means you have to carry to book around if you want to get some reading done in your spare time. Otherwise it's a great buy for anyone looking to break into the field or just has a general interest in the subject.LW"
4,EASY TO READ,"These two stories consist of Father and Son -- the son, Logan Callahan had come to Allentown to check out a construction site and of course Ashley Dawson objected to the destruction of an old house her historical committee was trying to save.Love developed over a week of consultations? and powerful attraction. The exchange between Ashley's sister, Mary and her mother was great in exploring the closeness of these 3 women. The contacts between Logan and his father kind of left you grinning. Poor pops couldn't understand this lethal attraction --- until he met Lindsay Dawson in the second story and he accidentally fell into the same trap.His seduction turned courtship lasted a bit over a week -- kind of fast for a confirmed bachelor turned 47 - or so he thought and all because Lindsay wanted to plan a belated reception for his son and her daughter! The story left one grinning and enjoying a fast and easy read."
1,Ughh,At first I was exetited to get this but then it took so long to warm up. I finally made a tiny piece of cotton candy but then it started overheating and shutdown It is also hard to clean because you have to take it apart and you have to clean it every fistful of cotton candy you make. I would NOT recommend buying this.
1,WASTED MONEY!!!!!!,DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK! IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! FOR THE 1ST TIME WE USED IT IT STARTED MAKING LOUD ANNOYING BEEPING SOUNDS..IT DIDNT MAKE COTTON CANDY..ONLY THIS GROSS GOOEY STUFF...AND IT BROKE AND WE HAD TO THROW IT AWAY. IF I WERE YOU I WOULD NEVER EVER BUY THIS MACHINE!-HANNAH AND HILARY NOEL
1,Doesn't work,"Besides being time consuming in warm up and cool down, this cotton candy machine simply does not work. We followed the directions exactly. A few strands of cotton candy started to come out and then it clogged, turned liquidy and started to burn. Because of the safety features, it is very difficult to unclog. We were very frustrated. We tried it several separate times hoping we could figure out what we were doing wrong, but it was the same each time. I would not recommend this machine to anyone."
1,What a Disappointment,Don't waste your money! I have followed all of the directions a number of times. I even got special cotton candy floss (sugar) and I still didn't get a quality product or any any decent quantity. Forget the pictures on the box. You can't get that much cotton candy out of this machine if you let it run for 30 mins. The product I got was more lumpy than fluffy. It seems not to heat up enough to make a good cotton candy cone. Put your money toward something better.
1,Really not that good,"Yep, Read the reviews and was did what I should. Mine did not put much out at all. It Was very loud. I did it four times. Mine put some stings out at first but just on one side of the inside. So really not a good item. The box it was gets me... It shows a nice full batch on the front of the box and I am not really sure anyone could get that like that. This was a gift but I think it should go back and get something else. Cute idea if you can get one that works but really was hoping to use it at a birthday party. LOL!"
2,Cotton Candy or MUSH!!!,I bought this product last year for my son who was dying to make some Cotton Candy We sat dowm with the entire family to play and with extream disapointment the machine gave us a little wet string ball. It had more liquid then cotton!!! It looked like a crystal stick. I did this over and over in hope I was doing something wrong Unfortunetly I did it right. I would not purchase this fOR ANY CHILD.
2,Sad Cotton Candy Maker!!,"We purchased this Cotton Candy machine because the only reason my children (age 5 and 3) want to go to the Circus, Zoo, etc. is for the Cotton Candy. How easy to just make it at home!!The instructions are not very clear and you have to let it heat up for 10 minutes before you can begin to use it. ( Tell that to 2 kids DYING for Cotton Candy.) Then we put in the sugar, only 1 teaspoon, and PRESTO it made Cotton Candy....But only about a large cotton ball size. I kept waiting for more, but that was it. Now just imagine splitting that between the kids!!!! It was fun and tasted great (the one whole bite) but is not worth it for children. In order to get even a small portion, it took forever and the kids were frustrated. I would not purchase again. But would maybe buy a different brand."
1,"awful toy, NOT worth the money","This thing made us wait to heat up,made the cotton candy for a very short while before we had to stop...cool down,clean, for three times in a row. The cotton candy mix just kept getting gunked up so that it would'nt make the cotton candy.I would not recomend for any one.It upsets kids & parents alike..."
5,We Love This Toy!,"We really love the cotton candy maker...my daughters aged 7 and 4 think it's the greatest. It does have to heat up as mentioned in another review, but this was like the first thing in the instructions - it was very clear. After it heats up, you can keep making cotton candy without having to reheat everytime (as long as you don't unplug it)...each batch makes 1-1.5 cups of cotton candy. My only complaint is that I haven't been able to find replacements for the paper cones in stores (although they are available through mailorder) -- so we use a mixing spoon to scoop the candy out."
5,happy happy happy,"I am 31 years old and love cotton candy, so i decided to go out and try this machine. What a great experience it was. i read some of the other reviews, the directions are very clear and very easy to follow. I do understand the concern about the recall so i took the liberty of calling the consumer affairs hotline and the only model that is being recalled is model # 5696. Since then safety measures, and replacement parts have been put in the newer machines sold today."
1,I couldn't get it to work either,"Well, I wish I would have reviewed the rating on this one. I bought it on sale for my son's 12th Birthday. The first day we tried it, there really wasn't much cotton candy coming out; enough for one bitful. Each time we added another teaspoon of sugar, less cotton candy came out. So I decided to take it apart and clean it. The second time we tried it, i guess the parts weren't dry enough, so melted sugar started coming out. So I took it apart and cleaned it again. This time I allowed the parts to dry for two days. Then we tried it again for the 3rd time. Cotton candy started coming out great, but it was only enough for one bitful, then melted sugar started coming out again. Then it started smoking. So I turned it off, and let it cool down. This thing is going back to the store. I really was determined to make it work, but I just couldn't. I wouldn't recommend this product at all. Also, the directions need to be made a bit clearer."
1,"Junky Piece..Im serious, dont buy this!!!","i got this for my birthday because it looked really cool and i wanted to eat cotten candy...We followed every instuction adn it was a piece of junk...first of all, it made sooooo much nosie it was bothering. Next, you have to wait almost 2 days for it to make cotten cady!!! next, when you finally wait, theres only a bite size , enough for an ant to eat. Trust me, if i knew this before, i would not have bought it."
