2,why the say UNRATED,By all means you can not say this is unrated movie. most of the seen are very mild. if you r looking for unrated movie don't buy this one
5,"Season 5, The Best of the Best!","I just love One Foot in the Grave, and Season 5 has some of the series' best episodes, plus the 1995 special, The Wisdom of the Witch. It's hard to find a show featuring an older couple like the Meldrews, as so much of television centers around the young; and I admit that is one reason I find it so appealing. But even the younger crowd will love the dry, dark humor in this series. There are so many unexpected twists and turns in each episode, so many threads leading up to the always hilarious, usually surprising conclusion. Highly recommend!"
5,Why I use Jason Ester C Creme,"You can buy cheaper products, but they do not compare to Jason Products. I stared using them when a Co Op trucked products to our town. They no longer do that. The Creme arrived promptly and in good condition. I will definitely reorder this and other Jason Products from this supplier. I have found Amazon to be extremely reliable."
4,"Jason Natural Cosmetics, Ester-C Creme, 2 oz",I really love this face creme. It is very hydrating and I even use it on my neck and hands.
2,TOO much fragrance!,"The moment I opened this jar, I knew I was in trouble. Why? It has a LOT of fragrance. Yet, I still tried it on the back of my hand. Even that far from my face, it smelled too strong--irritating my nose and eyes.So, I offered it to my Mom, then my sister and then a friend. They all said the same thing--too smelly! So, I'll never know if this product is as effective as it sounds. Darn!"
3,Pretty good but not amazing product,"I purchased some products from the Ester-C line because of all the positive reviews about anti-aging benefits and sun damage repair. I have been using this on my face in combo with the Ester-C Hyper C Serum for one month now. The creme does have a funky smell which can be a turn off for some. It is tolerable and you get use to it. But if a pleasant scent is very important to you, you will not like this product. The serum has a much more pleasant smell though. So far my results have been nil: I have seen no change in the condition of my skin on my face thus far. I read reviews about older women who used the product for many years and swore by it (I'm 40ish) so I am going to keep going until the creme runs out and see if there are any noticeable results."
2,Liked the older version better,"The new formulation of this product has a strong orange smell, as compared to the older version which is unscented. It also feels greasier than the older version. As for the vitamin C, I suggest doing some online research to help with deciding which products have the type of vitamin C that is actually helpful."
2,This product irritated my skin.,"I do not have particularly sensitive skin at all, and I can usually use almost any type of lotion. However, this cream irritated my skin and made it turn red and bumpy. I noticed that it contains ""citrus oil."" I can't imagine why anyone would decide to put such a harsh and acidic substance into a face-cream. I could feel and see the signs of irritation instantly, after applying only a small amount of the cream. Again, I do not have sensitive skin and don't often have a poor reaction to any beauty-products.It also has a rather yucky fragrance, sort of a ""fake fruit"" scent, like cough syryp. I do not recommend this product. Orange oil belongs in candles or something, not on your face."
5,Great cream!,I bought this product with the hope that it will help my neck look better . I have sun damage and was happy with the results so far. I have been using it about 2weeks .......I also love the smell.....oranges ;)
3,Maine-iac,"I had previously purchased the Jason Vit C serum and was very pleased with it, so purchased this cream thinking it would be a good product match when used together. There was really nothing 'wrong' with the cream, but did not see any improvment when using it. The 'smell' of the cream had a bit of an offputting odor, but not terribly bad. The Vit C serum has a very light, pleasant citrus smell and I highly recommend that product. This cream was okay if you're looking for a general moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin with eczema & rosacea, so was looking for something mild that would improve the dry skin some. I tend to like the more natural products for purer ingredients and mild, natural fragrance. This cream was nothing special, I'd likely not purchase it again."
3,The older formula was better,"I was so excited to find this creme on amazon for less than it costs in my local store. The old JASON Ester C moisturizing creme was my very favorite facial moisturizer ever. Unfortunately, when this arrived I was disappointed to find that JASON has changed the formula.The new formula is ok, but it's not as nice as the old formula. It's not as nice on my skin. . . I can't quite place the difference. . . and while I LOVED the old fragrance, the new citrus fragrance isn't as pleasing. I will have to renew my search for the perfect facial moisturizer, because this new formula just doesn't do it for me. :(To Amazon's credit, when I complained that the creme I'd received was NOT the same as the creme described here, they promptly refunded my money. So I remain a loyal Amazon customer, even if I was disappointed with this purchase."
3,Nice enough,"This moisturizer smells and feels good, but it's not as moisturizing as it would seem for a heavy-feeling cream. I still have dry patches on my skin. I'll keep using it, but I am looking for another product."
2,Civil Rights,"Sena Jeter Naslund's FOUR SPIRITS was very difficult to get into. I started it six times as it is a book club read. The story meanders all over the place and many times I found myself looking back through the pages to discover who was telling the story.This is a book I can not recommend unless you have a deep interest in the early civil rights movement.Nash Black, author or Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
5,A MUST READ!!!!,"I am not going to type a long review. (Though there is nothing wrong with it.) But, I will say this is a great book and give it a chance before you put it down!!!"
2,Disappointing Second Novel,"The writing is equally beautiful to Ahab's Wife, but the story seems to be begging for a plot triangle. It's hard to understand why Naslund would have let this be published in such raw form. Characters make brief appearances and then disappear for pages. Chapters read almost like separate vingettes. Makes me wonder if publishers were pushing Naslud to meet a printing date: It is so peculiarly inferior to her other story, and odd when, clearly, her writing standards are so very, very high."
1,i'd love to review this product,but i ordered it and amazon sent me an entirely different product. I got ordered the leapfrog and received a generic product. pretty deceptive actually. not happy.
1,Stay away!!!!,I never write reviews but I am so unhappy I am going to do it this time. I just received the Terk LF-IRX Remote Control Extender. I bought two units and neither one of them work even close to what I expected. I am only transmitting about 20 feet line of site through one floor and the receiver only gets the signal about 10% of the time.
2,Terk Leapfrog is a powerful extender,It worked worked really well throughout the house. These are much more powerful than what radio shack sells. I don't know the other products.
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this awhile ago and it has too much interference to be of any value. I tried to return it to Amazon, but I bought it on a special pricing and so they wouldn't take it back. Extremely dissapointed in the product and Amazon."
1,BAD DESIGN!,"Although the ""RF"" part works perfectly and has no problem sending the remote signal over a long distance and through many walls, the INFRARED reciever (the part you actually point your remote at) is terrible! It is very unforgiving as far as angles go. You have to point your remote directly at the little IR logo on the side of the unit or it won't pick up the signal at all...if you aim a couple feet to the left or right, forget it! And I'm only 10 feet away from it! Really frustrating to use."
1,poor operation,IF YOU ARE MORE THAN 4 FT AWAY FROM THE RECEIVING UNIT FORGET IT! I WILL BE RETURNING THESE!!
3,Good up to 5 feet,"Was hoping to get 50 feet out of these guy's. No luck. I was trying to go from downstairs to main floor, no luck. Product comes with everything needed though. If you are looking to put the 2 units very close to each other to hide your components, This is for you, if you are looking to go over 30 feet, go with the X-10 Powermid, I bought one of those and it solved all of my distance issues."
2,Leapfrog review,"The Terk tech. lf-irx remote control extender. is in my opinion a poor system if you wish to control a device with the IR recever across the room.My experience was as follows. At eight feet I got no response. at five feet I got about 10-15 percent response. When I placed the receiver on top of the Cable box and used the wire with led placed next to the ir control on the box i finally got 100 percent control. I concede that I have room to room wireless control, but I am disappointed, with the ir transmission of the wireless receiver."
4,Works fine most of the time,"Seems like when the electricity goes out at my house (which is apt to do), they stop working, so I have to unplug/plug from time to time. Otherwise, they work great. They have to go through about 60 feet and 3 walls of my home to control my satellite receiver."
5,"Finally, one that works","Works grest, tiny, 3 stick on emitters included. I'm using these so I can close the wooden doors on my A/V cabinet w/o loosing the ability to operate everything. The IR sensor is actually on one side of this device, so it only presents about a 1"" x 2"" profile to the room. The transmitter in the cabinet hits all of my equipment, even without using the 3 emitter eyes that are included. It is more of a true IR blaster and bounces off the walls of the enclosure."
1,New Terk LF-IRX model doesn't work - need old version same model number,"The New LF-IRX by Terk is HORRIBLE. It will not work unless you are literally holding the remote about 3 inches from the transmitter. Luckily Terk does make an item that works great. It is the old version of the LF-IRX. Yes, it has the exact same model number. You can put the transmitter up to 10 feet away with no problems. Anything over 10 feet from the remote that you are using and you will experience delay. It will work but it takes a few punches of the remote before it executes. I baught 2 extenders and put one transmitter on each of the end tables on either sides of the room so no matter where you are in the room you are always within 5-7 feet and it works great."
3,Good for the most part; TV interferes with IR signal sometimes.,"For the most part I am pleased with it; if it had cost more I would have returned it. Maybe it is my own set up and equipment. The IR transmission signal gets interference from the TV set. If I turn the TV set off, the Terk Remote Extender works flawlessly. Some times it works without a problem, others not; not 100% reliable. I tried plugging it in different electric outlets, as they recommend, and it didn't do it. I bought it mainly for operating my DirecTV satellite receiver. Perhaps it is the DirecTV receiver; if the receiver's IR sensor is somewhat blocked by the Terk's little sensor detector that you place in front of the component, when having problems with transmission, as Terk recommends, the remote won't work. Finding the right ""angle"" to place this little sensor is tricky and time consuming. Perhaps telephone signals also interfere with the transmission. In any case, it could be better."
2,Will work when it wants to and when you don't want it to,"Easy enough installation and was very excited at first. I purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law who has a media center in a closet and has not been able to use remotes unless standing in front of the unit. So, obviously, if this thing worked, it would alleviate the need to get up everytime she wanted to change the channel. While it seemed to work at first (and by ""at first"", I mean the first few minutes), it seems to have a mind of its own. It will fluctuate the volume at random, going from a deafening decibel to barely audible. The channel will change at will. And it will cut units on and off as it pleases. So, now 6 weeks after purchasing, it's unplugged due to the hassle. Back to Square 1"
1,If you enjoy having frustration be a part of your tv viewing experience purchase this product.,Barley worked-while it was working at all. Had to pretty much be touching the receiver with the remote to get it to work. Receiver had to be aimed PERFECTLY at the devices infrared port.Now it does not work at all and it's too late to return it.If you enjoy having frustration be a part of your tv viewing experience purchase this product.
1,This thing is scary!,"Most of the time, it works great. But once in a while, this thing gets scary. I used it for my cable box and one day, it started changing the channels on my cable box by itself. I had to keep switching the channel back to where I wanted it, but then a few seconds later, it would change the channel again. Seriously, this thing is scary! Stay away! What a waste of $20!!"
1,Watch out for the new version!,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I had the older style before this new one was sent to me and it was the perfect solution! This newer model (with the same model number, I might add) is useless! You have to be 4 feet in front and aim your remote directly at it for it to work. The older model worked everywhere. Why did Terk have to break this wonderful product! Amazon should stop selling this product. I only wish I could get my money back!"
1,Poor Quaity,"It did not work, and the way it was packaged with the plastic all around it, you had to cut it out. It makes it hard to return it in it own packaging."
1,Not for Dish or anything else.,I bought this to use with my dish network and it doesn't. If the unit is turned on the remote to my sharp TV and dish satellite receiver will not function when in the main viewing room. I was able to get it to function briefly when the remote was five inches away but inexplicitly stopped even though nothing had been changed with regards to positioning of the transmitter or receiver. I am selling my stock in Leap Frog. They were supposed to be a great company on the rise but not with this kind of shoddy product. DO NOT BUY THIS AT ANY PRICE INCLUDING FREE!
1,Junk,"I'm amazed that they can even sell this junk, or that Amazon sells it for them. I have to believe they get 99% of these POS's back immediately. I had the old style which worked well but then China started making them. Can't wait until they start importing cars and airplanes from China. It will be time to walk."
2,Sporadic at best.,"The setup: I'm using this with a TiVo remote - the transmitter is on one side of a standard wall from the receiver (3ft away). The receiver is in a dark room with all the sensors arranged in front of the TiVo, the transmitter is also in a fairly dark room.Usage: I've found that the response is very sporadic. Sometimes it'd work perfectly, sometimes I'd get double-keypresses, sometimes I'd get no response at all. I found with the no-response instances, waiting a minute or two seemed to ""reset"" synchronization between the sender and receiver and then it'd work fine for a while again. I'm pretty sure it's not an issue with the remote itself as I also use it to control the TV directly and have no problems.Can't recommend it."
1,Does not work as advertised,"I purchased this item to control the Dish receiver box for a stand alone television in the basement, instead of renting another receiver. It was easy to install but didn't work. In talking with the Terk technician, he said it wouldn't work with a Dish remote controller and to try a different manufacturer. The product information said it would work with any satellite remote, but it doesn't. I feel like this is false advertising to sell a product they know won't work with certain remotes."
2,Works decently.,"They work decent: it doesn't catch every button press, and there is a bit of lag, but they do work. Only complaint is that the IR blaster took a decent amount of work to position on the front of the Tivo so that it would allow the remote to work around it."
5,Good range extented,"I have a receiver that unless you are right in front of, the remote will not work. With this range extender the problem has been solved. Easy to set up."
1,Does not work with satellite TV,"As advertised I was hoping to be able to view tv in another room. The advertisement stated the product worked with satellite TV. I set it up which was very easy. The advertisement states it works within 100 ft. My other room was far shorter, yet I receive no reception at all."
1,"Yep, the new silver square version is garbage","People should be warned. Terrible product. Terk should be ashamed. The signal relay is very unreliable, even when the units are right next to each other and you're holding the remote 2 feet away from the transmitter. Just awful."
1,LF-IRX Leapfrog Remote Control Extender,"I ordered the titled item to allow me to change channels on a Satellite Receiver from one room to another, and it did not work, so I returned the item and received a replacement and it did not work as advertised , that item was also returned and Credit was issued, thankyou, This item should not be sold to anyone else as it will not operate as expected."
3,"not perfect, but workable","We bought the Terk Leapfrog product because we share a DirecTV receiver between two televisions in different rooms. We wanted our remote to work in both rooms. The product works great in the room without the receiver, but the unit that goes in front of the receiver to transmit the remote signal constantly puts out signal ""noise"" that interferes with the signal from the remote. So, while it works great in the room without the receiver, it makes it difficult to use your remote when you are actually in front of the receiver. This is annoying, but workable. You just have to remember to turn the IR transmitter away from the receiver before using the remote in the room with the receiver. We found out today from a DirecTV service person that the DirecTV receivers have IR remote capability built-in. He gave us a couple of IR DirecTV remotes and we no longer need the Terk Leapfrog. I'm mainly writing this review so DirecTV users know there is a better option."
2,Unreliable,"Used with my FIOS remote, if it works at all, I have to click my remote (with new batteries) several times before it responds. Usually, it only works if I am pointing directly at it and am less than ten feet away."
1,"Did not work - Flimsy, science fail contraption","Bad! Bad! Bad!What can I say, this thing did not work. I got maybe 1 or 2 signals to actually reached and functioned my component inside my cabinet.The design is like something a child would design for a 5-grade science project--and it would earn an Honorable Mention ribbon at best. Thin plastic casing. Light weight...the satellite receiver's (short) cable easily moves the transmitter out of position when you are trying to position the dumb things. And who uses a metal, external antennae any more...this is 2012, right. Enough said.Never said this before about a product: DO NOT BUY THIS THING!"
3,Does not live up to advertising,"Range is no where as stated. (100 feet? Maybe in a vacuum on the dark side of the moon) The base unit receives all kinds of interference from other devices - it receives every signal in its frequency - not just the extension unit. The base unit then washes out any other remotes that are trying to connect to their devices. (I was trying to use this device with my existing Xantech devices - there shouldn't be a conflict - IR is IR)Nice try Leapfrog/Terk/Audiovox, but make a smarter system."
1,Not Operable out of box,Although sale went well and ANTOnline provided product as described in a timely fashion when I recieved the leapfrog the reciever end would not power up. I tried various trouble shooting methods without result. I did not notify ANTOnline since the shipping cost half as much as the product. I will not use TERK again.
1,Does not work that well,I have my cable box behind a cabinet door with no window on it. I purchased the extender so I could still operate the cable box. I repositioned the receiver and transmitter several times.Sometimes it works properly and others it does not. Range also seems to be an issue. If I move more than 6 feet away from the receiver it has problems seeing the signal.
2,Did not work for me.,The system worked well as long as I stayed in the same room.Would not work from back bedroom only 30 ft away with wood walls. I do have a wireless network which may have caused problems. Returned item and got the Wireless RF Remote Control Extenderfrom Next Generation Home Products. This is great works anywhere and responds well.
5,Works perfectly,I saw a variety of reviews on this remote control extender and was a little concerned before I purchased it. I figured for the price I didn't have much to loose. It worked great right from the beginning. No problems. Highly recommend.
2,"good service, so-so product",Item was delivered in good time by the dealer. The product works on some devices but not on my Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300HD cable box. The out put IR signal seems weak. It must be close and delicately aligned to the devices to be reliable.
1,I have to use it without illumination,"1) I can't make it work without keeping transmitter and receiver in line of sight, which mean you can not locate TX/RX in different room. It is main purpose of this product. Right?2) When I didn't press remote controller, the receievr still keep transmit noise signal from what it receive from RF signal.3) And I think it may be weak to against interference. So I turn off the light and it work well. But it is still unaccetable that I have to use it without illumination4) Next, I move this IR set to my friend's appartment, it worked, no matter light on or off.So my suggestion is you may either1)try your friend sample first, to see if it work in your enviroments2) make sure your house haven't too much interference from your lighting equipements"
4,It works,It picks up the signals very well and quicker than my other remote extender from another company.
1,Wish I could give product and customer service zero stars,"We received this as a Christmas gift. Thought it would be the perfect solution to keeping DVR & cable box inside a closed cabinet and away from our curious baby. My husband and father-in-law tried for HOURS to get the LED light to come on which signals a connection. After that, they called Terk's customer service, and were told that this product is from 2006 and likely will not work with current remotes, and furthermore is not guaranteed to ""universally"" work with all TVs & remotes. The return process is painful and expensive, involving restocking fees, and the buyer is responsible for return shipping costs, even though the product is faulty. Highly do NOT recommend purchasing."
1,Garbage,Piece of garbage.. Works every other day. Would not recommend. Tried setting up with Sat dish.. 100 feet away with obstructed view..
4,Easy Installation and Works Great!,"I had this product and haven't had a problem since. Although there are times that I had to change the position of the extender, reponse is quick."
4,MAXI-SINGLE IS THE BEST CLUB CD!,"EVERYONE! YOU HAVE TO GET THE MAXI-SINGLE INSTEAD OF REGULAR CD-SINGLE, FOR THIS SONG! the maxi-single is awesome..the thunderpuss mixes are great, and the best mix ive ever heard is on it: the hex hector momentous mix of 'waiting for tonight""! you have to hear this! get it!"
1,not sure,I ordered this before Christmas and have not received it. I have nothing to rate. Poor customer service.
4,A Powerful Story,"Battle-Chasers takes a set of fairly standard fantasy characters and makes them convincing as individuals. The scene is a battlefield after the battle. It is littered with corpses and scorched by the devastation of magic weapons. The healer Chawk is a central character. Chawk heals any survivors, no matter which side they're on. Along with Tree (a huge elf-warrior) and Ringlerun (a dwarf), Chawk encounters foes ranging from the Undead to a fire elemental and a vampire sorceress. My favorite character is Chosser, a mad assassin with four personalities. Each personality has its own goals and mode of action. The scenes between Ringlerun and his dragon-foe are strongly and surprisingly presented. For readers who like intense and imaginative fantasy, Battle-Chasers is a must-read."
5,Battle-Chasers,I found this book un-put-downable. From start to finish the pace never lets up giving you little time to think about such mundane acts as eating and drinking. Mr Robinson's vivid description and use of the putrifying mess that's left after a major battle adds great a twist to the story. I recommemnd this book with only one reservation that it should to be read on an empty stomach. Otherwise buy it!
5,strawberry excellent,The child who received it as a Christmas gift was totally delighted and enjoys repeated listening!
5,"Surprisingly CATCHY, FUN, ENERGETIC, POSITIVE CD!","What a pleasant, refreshing change! I was very hesitant to purchase this CD. My husband, our 3.5 yr. old daughter, and I all have been SO happy that I did! Filled with REMARKABLY FRESH, POSITIVE, PERKY songs, not babyish, not rehashed tunes, not too mature in themes, it is PERFECT for little girls. HOW lovely to find something so suitable for our daughters!"
1,not the greatest,"what happened with Pellin Rodriguez, Andy Montañez and Roberto Roena? I'm not taking away from Papo, Jerry and Charlie but they aren't the only ones who have performed with the groupThis could have been a better product for one of the best musical organizations ever born in PR."
3,Somehow disappointed,"As this was ""a homage"" to El Gran Combo, I expected a more complete history of the group. Former vocalists (Peyin, Rodriguez, Andy Montanez and Roberto Rohena) were absent. MArtin, who was always the happy clown, was not given proper participation either. Pictures, clips, etc of these members (and others not in the group today) would have given us a true history of the group.In addition, the 1st. time I saw the dvd, I had to click after each song in order to get to the next one. Extremely annoying. The 2nd. time around it went automatically. I expected to have some more information in the ""Behind the Scenes"" segment. I was left with a sense of ""something's missing here"".My friend, who's equipment is older and doesn't have a remote, was unable to view past track number 3.Also, the interviews and takes were cut too abruptly and the writings were left on screen too short to read all.I enjoyed all the songs and interviews, but expected more."
3,"Not very fast ""instant-on""","I have other instant-on fluorescents that brighten up about twice as fast as these. Still happy with them, because my Home Depot's 18W bulbs are all the old slow-start kind and these beat them easy."
4,Built to last!,"I've owned mine for well over three years now, and it still produces the same quality of gameplay as it did when I first bought it. Simple and easy to use, I'd definitely recommend this to those new to joystick-controlled games, or to anyone that just doesn't feel the need to spend a lot of money. Though there are some other low-priced joysticks out there that have more buttons on them, none will last as long as this one. So if it's durability and low cost you're after, look no further."
1,Bargain Bin Joystick,This Joystick is a standard $5 junk bargain bin joystick. it only has two buttons and they have the nerve to charge us $30. RETHINK YOUR PRODUCTS MICROSOFT.
2,ROC74,"This sounds like a true bootleg. The recording is quite bad. The music is very good, but there should have been some remastering of this before its is officially released. All that being said it's great to hear Leslie West playing incindiary guitar from the premier rock palace of all time."
2,Meh !,"I knew it was cheap when I bought it but since I receiving it, it sits in a drawer not getting used. I usually buy single function stomp boxes so this is my first ""multi"" function pedal after 30 years of playing. I'm not impressed in the quality of the tones, the usefullness, construction and probably the reliability.save your money and go get an ice cream."
5,Huge bang for your buck!,"So I started off looking for a simple headphone amp for my bass guitar which range in price from $40 to $80 amd my guitar player friend recomended that I get a small bass effects pedal. And long story short this thing is a headphone amp, a tuner, a amp simulator, a multi effects pedal, and a drum machine all in a $49.00 package."
4,Zoom bass pedal,"Sounds great, works great, not the best out there, but for the price, it worked for me. Used it on the worship team a few times, and also practicing at home. I wouldnt use it for my main gigs though - too many drunks stomping around.. and this little thing is plastic. But it works goodly enough for most things :)"
4,Zoom B1 Bass Multi-Effect Pedal,"Sure,, you can buy better multi-effect pedals for bass, but for the money, if your a simple gigging musician, or you just want to noodle around with some effects, you cant beat the Zoom B1. The presets are a little wild, but once you figure out how to edit your own patches, it will really surprise you. Very easy to use."
4,Can't beat it for the price!,"This is an affordable way to beef up your bass on the cheap. Easy to work with, and the manual is fairly clear with specifics when you're ready to get in deeper with manipulating the effects. A nice array of presets (from clean to punchy to rough distortion to flat out bizarre and alien) so you can plug right into it and start playing. It comes with a power supply, also a nice bonus. If I had a single critique, it would be for a couple more outputs. But at $50, you really can't complain. Just run it out into your mixer and take it from there, no big deal. I was very impressed with the resulting sound, very clean and polished. It also has several built-in drum tracks to jam along with, nice bonus feature. Recommend if you're on a budget and in need of a solid effects pedal or a back-up pedal to gig with. It's nothing to brag about but gets the job done."
4,Great little thing for home recordings!,"I bought this pedal to pump up my bass sound for my home recordings, and I'm very pleased with what I got! It's easy to use, cheap and has more effects than most bassist usually want. At first site, it might look weak due to its plastic composition, but its plastic is hard, so don't worry. A USB output would be welcome, in order to make things easier, but bass is very recordable via line-in input, so it's not such a worry. A 20 minutes learning curve will get you creating your own patches with no pain. Its tuner also works very well, even for the B string of a 5 or 6 strings bass.You can check how fat it made my bass sound here:[...]"
5,Tremendo!,"Es extremadamente buena esta edición; contiene todos los trabajos más relevantes del sensacional Oscar Wilde. La versión de ""El Retrato de Dorian Gray"" está bastante buena. Recomendado!"
2,Good book if you don't watch CNN,"This book is for teenagers that haven't watched the news and are doing a book report. Saying this, if you watch CNN and have followed the events of the both Gulf wars or even have a vague idea about what went on during these two conflicts, then 60% of this book is basically a broad and generalized summary of those events.The first quarter of the book is interesting if you're curious as to how Saddam came to power as a young Islamic buck. Then especially interesting is Saddam's sons Uday and Quasay (whatever). Both sons would make your pot smoking kid look like an angel in comparison to the sadistic naughtiness of these two young Persian Gulf monsters.The book reads like a text book, and lacks any sense of eloquence. Buy this book for your least favorite uncle."
5,Love it!,"I bought this clock to go into the living room of my new home. It goes perfectly with the decor, and it adds a touch of style. Love it!"
5,Great Retro clock,"Got this for the kitchen. Looks great against the new paint, pale yellow. Nice look, not too big, Wish it had a second hand."
4,Retro Metal Wall Clock...a RED one!,"Shipping was timely, but the packaging was minimal. Clock in its original box was placed inside slightly larger box, with several ""air-pillow-bags, and some wadded up brown wrapping paper. The clock box rattled around inside the outter box. It made it safely, no damage to the outter box, nor the clock...but I would say that luck was certainly with it on the trip.The clock is heavy, easy to read, nice looker, and keeps great time.I had considered a green one, but decided that red would be easier to see and more style impact in my kitchen. When I received it...I thought oops, I should have gotten the polished metal model..to match my appliances. I am, however, very happy with the red one!I do recommend this clock to you if you are looking for an easy to read, battery powered, retro-looking wall clock for your home!"
1,AVOID for spa use...too many tempo changes and singing voices,"You will like this CD if you are paid to review it (Kathy Parsons) or deaf. However, if you try to use it for massage or spa use, it doesn't bring comfort or healing to the clients. We tried to play it for a week in our Buddha Spas and had to pull all the songs except for 2 from our playlist rotation. Too many customers (and therapists) complained that the tempo shifted too often and there was singing on a few of the songs...disappointing."
3,"Works well, but---","the measurements start from the end of the tape, not the ring/hook. That means you must off-set whatever you're attaching the ring to by one inch, the ring's diameter. The description is ambiguous, so don't trust it. Other than that, and that can be a big irritation if you're doing pin-point surveying, as I do, this tape is pretty well made. One other thing: Once you reel the tape completely in, it snaps into a locked position. You have to pull it with a fairly good amount of force to advance the tape, again. If you're in the field doing this over and over, again, it's kind of a pain."
3,Re: mix,"With just enough genuine electronic experimental energy, this album narrowly escapes the confining ""remix-compilation"" stigma it so desperately tries to evade with some clever, diverse production. Although there are plenty of moments when the techno filtering brilliantly compliments these anthemic, earnest instrumentals, some tracks became sidelined with unfulfilled experimentation."
2,"Mediocre, at best","At first glance, this slim book held promise, and I sat down eagerly to read it. The writing, while somewhat juvenile, was still more... entertaing than the standard chess book fare. However, once I applied his so-called ""tricks"" to my own game, I realized how outdated they really were. For example, in the starting phase of my end game, I took his advice of 3. Nc3 e6 4. Nf3 Be7. Big mistake. I lost two moves afterwards. Pick this up if you're interested in cute anecdotes and charming plays. But otherwise, I suggest ""Simple Chess,"" by Michael Stean, a much more enlightening read, to be sure."
2,A MOVIE TO BUG YOU,"If you're a horror fan like me, when you think of the name Roger Corman, you think of some of the cheesiest horror films ever, with the basic ingredients as such: bad acting; weak script and direction; and cheesy special effects. That's why you end up liking Corman's ""B"" films.SCORPUS GIGANTUS is not a classic even for Corman, but the effects of the bug are much better than usual, but alas the acting is atrocious. Even the usually dependable Jeff Fahey goes overboard in his role as the head of an elite delta force called in to battle--what else---a genetic experiment gone wrong. Most of the action is set in dark places like warehouses and on a boat, so you don't get to see a whole lot of the bug monster, but when it does appear, it's not too bad. If you're a fan of cheesey films, this one won't disappoint nor excite."
2,"2.5 Not too bad, but....","Well, at least they have the creatures done right...the rest we have seenbefore.... small crew, lots of bullets...blah blahblah. Roger Corman should find some exta money, add in a extra few scenesof the creatures out in the open (village.cities) doing damage, and thismovie could have been a 3-4 stars...but noooo...save a few bucks, stickto the formula and make more so so films.Luckely the acting is fairly good, and there is no screaming bimbos."
3,Seems to work better than ginko,"For me, the memory product searcher it seems to work better that ginko. I know this is purely anicdotal but you did ask for a review. Try it in combination with ginko."
4,"Definitely worth reading, but we're not quite there yet","I've read a number of books on this topic and this one gets to its point better than most. However, I'm not sure that we're quite there yet in terms of a complete definition of consciousness. If this is real, then we now have what we need to build a conscious machine - so why isn't it done yet? A description of the ""I-ness"" still seems to be missing. How would we create ""the first person"" view in a machine? Great food for thought, well worth reading."
5,The most definitive TRUE album.,"I was one of the lucky ones who pre-ordered this, and after a few weeks of delay, it's finally here.This is hands down the most definitive TRUE album you can obtain. Spanning 2 CD's of music and a DVD, it contains all versions of their songs from the album, some never before on CD including 12"" and 7"" inch remixes, some live versions, PLUS....it also includes the once VHS only and out-of-print ""Spandau Ballet Over Britain"" ON DVD!!! (and the making of True, plus a few other live clips from the Top Of The Pops show in England.) This is the most complete and comprehensive 'True' album you will ever own. A must for a real Spandau Ballet fan.Excellent re-mastering and sound quality. It made my other previous True album from my collection sound muted. It's awesome!"
1,wrong version,"It has only 15 songs in it. After I received this, I found it'snot full version. Moreover, deleted parts were what I wanted;4. Duran Duran-The Reflex, 9. Arcadia-Election Day 14. Power Station-Some Like it Hot 18. ABC-Love Conquers All.[...]"
5,Great work,This prayer book is a very great daily companion for anyone who wants to grow spiritually daily.It is highly recommended for day to day use by anyone.
2,Not very readable,"I believe Lyons would be a nice person to meet, and no doubt knows his stuff, but in my opinion, his style of explaining the material would be somewhat irritating to someone with little knowledge of semantics.This book tries to explain things from the side too much, making it difficult to keep sight of any straight forward material. He adds too many exceptions and gives opaque references to bits and pieces of important items.His writing style in this book is too ""beat around the bush"", and hardly creates a coherent, straight forward, explanation of the material -- its just too far from ""spilling the beans"" in style."
3,Meh,"The material is good quality, plenty of pockets and zippers that allow access to pants pockets being warn under the Flightsuit.However I either have a really long torso with short legs or this is cut short in the torso. Without pants, it rode up quite a bit and no room for the boys. Can't even sit down in these. Im 5'10"" waist 36"". The chest, waist were a perfect fit and I bought it in a large. There is no way to wear pants under this for me. So If your ""long torso'ed"" I'd suggest going with a larger size. Im going to try and exchange for an x-large or return it as I have found a shop in town that caries them and custom tailors them. The downside it costs about ~$200!"
1,Chunks in a can !!!!!!!,I did not think that the Papaya would be sentIn tin cans!!!! It should be sent in bottles or inPlastic container
1,Product with an install before date of 2005-06 and 1 out of 3 with torn packaging (open),The cost of the cartriges was cheap but the product was out dated (to be instaled by 2005-06) and the sealed packaging of one of the three cartriges was damaged.It looked liked the provider just wanted to get some money from a consumer and did not care about delivering what he was advertising.I will never deal with that provider again and I certainly think no one should.
5,Great Service,This was my first time ordering from Barbjewels and I was very happy with their service. When I am ready for new cartridges I will definitely look for them again to order my printer supplies from.
4,EXCELLENT !,"Written with courage, insight, understanding and complete honesty, Ms. Kay peels open her childhood in hopes of reaching others. She statesfacts of her life without rancor and shows us that abuse comes in many forms, some very insiduous and not easily seen from the outside. Her struggle to overcome her childhood is a roadmap to regaining yourself. A huge personal success and inspiration for others."
1,"Pretty Closed-Minded, in My Opinion","If you believe, like I do, that there is NOT one answer that applies to everyone, this book will not sit well with you. The author's insistence that he's got it all figured out and anyone who doesn't agree with him is a fool turned me off completely. I'm much more open to ideas that are presented with a 'this is what feels true for me, see if it feels true for you, too' attitude instead of ideas presented with an overblown ego."
3,Lost Secrets of the Msaya,"Interesting facts and put across very well, but I didn't realise it was just a 'seminar' format.Ian Xel Lungold seems like he was a very charismatic man and a shame his life was cut short by such an insidious disease."
4,Great Charger!,"I was kind of timid to order this product because it was a little bit more than I expected to buy for a charger, but I had lost the one that came with my camera so I didn't have much of a choice.It ended up being a great buy! It is more efficient than the one that came with the camera which is surprising and disappointing on Sony's part. They should offer a charger that does as well as this one with the original product.All in all, not a bad charger, at all!"
5,Highly Recommended,"This arrived in one day, is exactly what I expected and works perfectly. I would definatley recommend it."
5,Review of Sony BCTRG Travel Charger,The product is all that I had hoped it would be and was received on time as promised. I had lost the original that came with the camera and this is as good or better than what I had.
5,Well worth it,Spend the money on this charger..the time it takes to charge as opposed to the normal charger is amazing. worth the money
3,We need a standard battery!,"Overall this charger works great. it's compact and travels nicely. I find it distressing, however, that there are 8 million different choices for a battery. Each choice is equally overpriced. Companies need to do the consumer a favor and go to one or two standard battery sizes. I know there are a lot of implications in that, but surely we can have a better market then we have now."
4,Awesome backup,"This is great for traveling or when your other charger breaks. The prongs fold for easy packing. Too bad of the cost, but it is worth it in the end. Always have a back up."
2,enjoy a trago!,"el cd no esta mal my ways ,california,modo loco(no sabia se dedicaba a la caña de azucar)las que mas me bacilan, pero si lo que buscas es rap en español interesante mala rodriguez,orishas,sindicato argentino del hip hop...traen algo diferente."
2,Burns my eyes,"I was hoping to get something a little gentler on the eyes, as this is ""all natural"". However, it burns my eyes. Not as bad as some makeup removers that I've used in the past, but still...."
1,Disappointed,"These pads cause a burning sensation to my eyes and the skin around them. Generally unpleasant to use. I can't figure out how others did not experience this side effect, I will probably throw them away and try another brand. I do not have sensitive skin and have never had this type of reaction before."
4,A gift for Mom,"It was very nice. It came unframed, which may be better because then you can choose your own. It's a very sweet poem & the watercolor artwork is pretty. My little boy ordered it for me and gave it to me on Christmas, so it's extra special."
5,Beautiful.,"I bought this for my mother for Christmas, and it says it all. She cried when she read it and now has it displayed in the picture frame that I bought for her. :)"
1,Frustrating,"Everyone elses reviews are so nice, but the picture of it is so tiny. I understand you probably don't want people stealing your poems, but I'm not going to purchase something I can't read/see."
1,Pure crap.,"I'm very disappointed that these poker legends would put their name on this product. Unplanned and extremely low quality. At one point, I thought that I had bought a bad bootleg copy until I saw Gus swat away a fly in the middle of an unimpressive conversation. I doubt their was one single out-take. I couldn't even watch them all."
3,Track List - No Review,1. Fareed Haque; Inspiration City2. Jimmy Smith; Sister Sadie3. Ray Obiedo; Midnight Taboo4. Sara K.; If I Could Sing Your Blues5. Roy Ayers; Naste6. Richie Cole w/ Brass; You Go to My Head7. Maysa; What About Our Love8. Ken Navarro; Compassion9. Tony Guerrero; Underground Society10. Sam Cardon & Kurt Bestor; Sage of Laberene
4,Very Cool Music,"This is a great compilation CD of very cool music, Naste' and ""What about our Love"" are great pieces!.... Enjoy this one of the many Jazziz type CD comps....."
3,Side Effects?,"I had my dog wearing this collar about two weeks. In that time, I noticed a real behavior change. My normally happy, friendly, extremely tolerant dog started snapping at me for things that otherwise wouldn't have bothered her. I can't confirm that it was the pharmaceuticals in this product, but when I removed the collar, my dog's behavior seemed to return to normal. The purchaser should be aware that side effects may occur and read all the enclosed literature thoroughly."
1,BEWARE and CHECK DAILY!!!,"We live in heavily wooded acreage and I battle ticks on my 100lb. Anatolian Shepherd and Border Collie. I renewed the 1 on the Anatolian 5 days ago and checked it today and her whole neck was raw and bloody where the collar was. Removed the collar and it was even bloody. I was in shock and felt terrible wondering if it was worth nearly killing my dog for ticks!! There was even a huge gray tick alive 2"" from the collar & still attached! Actually paid $25. to make my dog suffer like this. I had checked the collar daily when I put the 1st collar on but had neglected to check it like I should as she is outside only. Never will use these again and had just purchased 4 more collars."
5,Pretty Shade of Blue,"This bracelet isn't as blue as the picture, but it still is a nice blue shade of turquoise. There is black veining, but it's more subtle than the picture. The beads are shiny and uniform in size and color."
5,New life for old recliner,"Ok, this isn't going to make your recliner look like it's straight from the factory, but the picture is accurate, it's a nice slipcover to give an older or stained chair a new life. It's perfect for the kids to adopt dad's old recliner. It's stretchy so it's not hard to put on. It has stretch loops to hold it in place, you have to feel around underneath your recliner to find springs or something to hook them onto. Smooth it out with your hand, and you have a serviceable chair and you no longer have to look at a rip in the upholstery, a stain, cat scratches, or whatever you want to hide."
1,Extremely unsatisfied,"We ordered a slip cover for a recliner. 1. The picture displayed was not accurate. It showed a cover that fit a separate foot rest like the chair we were ordering for. The cover we received was for a chair with a continuous foot rest. 2. We actually had to cut the slip cover and modify it to fit our chair. 3. The fabric used in this slip cover is thin and cheap and we are out $74.00 for it. All in all, we are very dissatisfied with the slip cover we received. Mr & Mrs Sandy Reece."
3,Disappointing,I was hoping for something more than just a formula repeat of previous books in this series. Both The King Betrayed and The King Imperiled left me with a downgraded opinion of Chester's efforts. I really loved her earlier books.
5,Pat Benatar: TROPICO (1984),"In 1984, Pat Benatar came around, yet again, with another album, this one being entitled, TROPICO, and it serves as Pat Benatar's sixth album. Damn! Pat has been getting around. That only goes to show you the dedication of a true Rock artist. This album, just like all of the rest, is simply amazing. It is definitely a winner.DIAMOND FIELDA great song.WE BELONGFirst single from the album. After hearing this song for the first time, I could not get it out of my head. This is another amazing song from Pat Benatar. Awesome song.PAINTED DESERTSecond single from the album. Awesome song. Very mellow, very relaxing.TEMPORARY HEROESGreat song.LOVE IN THE ICE AGEGreat.OOH OOH SONGGreat.THE OUTLAW BLUESThird single from the album. This album version is okay, but the single version (which appears on Pat's 1989 album, BEST SHOTS) is the better version.SUBURBAN KINGGreat song.A CRAZY WORLD LIKE THISGreat song.TAKIN' IT BACKGreat."
4,Keller's Den,"I just finished reading Keller's Den. Awesome reading, but scared the hell out of me! No more reading your books by myself. Keep on writing!"
3,Zeus Master of Olympus,There is some good information avaliable in the book but the level of detail avaliable for free from fan sites is higher. One thing in particular was a let down. In describing how to design a successful city the author does not appear to have played the game. All the things suggested are exactly the opposite of what veterins of this and previous games in the series have discovered in practicle aplication from hours of game play.
3,Standard Remix Fare,"As great as The Newlydeads self titled debut was, Re-bound isn't. The remixes are not very interesting, and at times seem overly long and drawn out. The highlights are the Skin Tight Skin remix by Spahn Ranch, and Go, a previously unreleasded Tones on Tail cover. Go will also be on the forthcoming Black and Shiney. If you are a die hard 'deads fan you'll want this CD, otherwise save our money for Black and Shiney."
4,Very nice devotional style book.,WHEN YOUR PET DIES was written primarly for children but is a comfort to adults too. The book can be read very quickly and is bascially in the style of a devotional type book full of nice comforting thoughts. I bought one for myself and have one on reserve for friends and family when the need arises.
4,the good hip-hop comps are usually better than most albums,"... on account of your average lp's hit or miss quality. this falls into the 'better than most' comp category, on account of bombs from the legendary Biz Markie (featuring more than nice production from Paul Nice), the ever intelligent J-Live and the comfortable pairing of Pete Rock and Groove Attack's own Grand Agent. There are better comps, but as a good overview of where underground hip-hop is at right now this is maybe the best place to start."
3,Nanase,"This is a pretty good album but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. None of her classics like TROUBLEMAKER, YUMEMIRU, LOVING YOU, MIDNIGHT BLUE, R.U.O.K. BITCH, BYE BYE, OOOO?, SECOND WIND, SEVEN SEAS, LIE LIE LIE, DHALIA KNOWS LOVE, HI WO TSUKERU BABY!, HEAT OF THE NIGHT, SHOCK OF LOVE, R-RATED, SEKAI WO KNO TE NO NAKA NI, ARE ON HERE. At least I think. Or is this the compilation CD? OOOOOOOOOOPs."
2,"good, when it works","I install high end kitchens for a living. A pin nailer is a necessity for me, but I am still waiting for a good one to come out. I would pay triple the cost of this thing if they would come out with one that doesn't jam or misfire all the time.Picture this, you're holding that crown moulding you just painstakingly cut to perfection and set in place...you hold it with one hand, apply your glue, grab the pinner and while holding both pieces together with one hand you gently ease the pinner to the perfect spot...squeeze slowly and pop. Pull the pinner back, let go and the pieces fall apart. Because the most frustrating tool in your box misfired AGAIN. I swear...I'd trade my new truck for a pinner that worked well.But, like I said...can't live without one."
1,Junk,Jams constantly. I have had this nailer for a year and a half and have only gotten it to fire about 10 nails. Dont buy one. It is complete junk!!!!!!!! I threw mine against the wall today.
1,O.K. for a homeowner who will use it a few times.,I owned 4 of these tools in the past for my cabinet shop. Over the past 4 years I have spent over $800.00 in maintenance. The biggest problem is that the driver blade breaks all the time. Since then I have purchased a GREX P635 and P630 and they work great. Over the past year they have only broken 1 driver blade that cost me $13.00. I now own 8 total and I don't have any problems. Stay away from the Finishpro 10 I strongly discourage it.
4,Very Good - but jams regularly,I am very happy with this nailer but it does jam fairly often. It is easy to clear but very frustrating. I really like the small holes that are left.
1,avoid at all cost,"This is the 2nd. one of these I,ve had in 2 years, only because the Co. sent me a new one after my 1st. gave it up in less than a year. I'm a professional woodworker who depends on his tools and once again this one has let me down. I mabey at the most use this pinner once or twice a week and it lasted a year almost to the day. I'm very disapointed and will not be buying any more of this brand of tools."
1,Jams way too often - not up to Senco quality,"I own lots of pneumatic tools and have had two Senco finish guns that ran like champs. Though this pin nailer has been treated well and oiled often it jams frequently. I've had this thing apart way too often on job sites trying to clear jams and often resort to using my brad nailer instead. Also, its lack of a safety means this gun will fire when the trigger is pressed even if the nose is not in contact with a work surface. (Of course, this assumes that it is a working gun, which mine often is not) I'm very disappointed with this product."
5,Great tool,"We bought this with a compressor combo for putting crown molding on kitchen cabinets and was not at all diappointed.Works very well when you understand the tool and purpose behind it. For best results, use it with hot melt or quick drying glue and it will eliminate you having to hold parts while the stay in place, plus you can shoot right to the edge in hardwoods and does not splinter, but watch your fingers!It does not have a saftey on it, so don't plug it in with finger on tigger.The Carpenter"
2,not worth the money,it is not any better than normal kitchen scissors. Maybe it is a good garden shears. P.S. the vedio demontration on williams sonama's website is very misguiding. Don't expect to cut thru leg bones.
1,"wood probably, metal rarely !",Very disappointed....bits are not sharp and refuse to cut into steel. Good thing there a many of them as they are needed to replace others that have gone dull after very few turns...Definately not worth the money !!
1,toolman,"this advertisement is a missleading ad there is no such thing as a coalt enhanced tin for hss drill sets .Its either hss or cobalt not both tin coated,THIS SET IS NOT COBALT its hass coated.TIN stands for titanium nitride coating.ive been in tool sales for 20 years this is my oppinion."
1,Not worth $60,I had my set for couple weeks now and I have already broken a bit. The material is very brital. While drilling steel the bit broken in half. I also discover that the tip surface is not exactly even/symmetrical which results in your work piece wobbling on initial contact. Once the bit digs into the work piece the wobbling stops. I compare this wobbling affect with a USA made bit and there were zero wobble with the USA bit. These bits are sharp and will go through steel like butter. Overall I am not happy with the purchase. I would return it if I hadn't broken a bit. It was a waste of $60.
3,Great for my use,"I'm a industrial mechanic and I do a good amount of fabricating. Including a lot of drilling and tapping. Even through ""AR"" these bits do very well. With low speed and cutting fluid I get much life out of these. I have had no success with sharpening these bits. Once the surface is worn or damaged the bit is trash. Turn your torque down on smaller bits. They will break fairly easy.For the price and what I use them for ""5 stars"". For a machine shop ""1 star"". It all comes down to what you need and how much you want to spend. I just bought a second set for the shop at work."
1,100% junk,100% china junk if it's true that you get what you pay for than i got robbed! if you want a good bit set at a low price go to northern tool and equipment
2,Offshore Tools,"I truly appreciate the comments on this drill set. I've decided not to order the 115 pc. set. I must question my judgement for having considered this set. The value of any coating is lost immediately when the bit is sharpened and a such seem ill-suited for anything but casual, homeowner use. Quality control seems to be lacking as drills are out-of-round, the drill point angle is uneven, etc. The drill point angle can be corrected but there goes any perceived advantage of a coating. Never mind drill point angle and coatings...an out-of-round drill bit is worse than no bit. In closing, two things come to mind. #1 is, ""you get what you pay for"". #2 is, ""if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"". Thanks to the reviewers."
4,While this CD does contian good singers it fails many ways.,"Though such groups as Foreigner,and Journey are on the CD, it is only Madonna's song Crazy for You, that truly makes this CD. While Crazy for you brings to mind a very romantic and loving passoniate scene, the other songs range the gambit and rearly if at all come across as songs that actually know where they want to head. The only true reason this CD hs earned 4 stars is due to Madonnas Crazy for You song."
5,Great,These songs take me back to a simpler time. This is a great cd to play at home A+. Going to be quite rare.
5,still underrated,"Icehouse was and continues to be one of the most underrated bands of the 80's. Iva Davies is a deeply talented musician who has continued to write and score music away from the mainstream American spotlight. Listening to Measure for Measure takes me back to an incredibly wonderful, silky and soulful time for music. A must have."
4,Truly remarkable...,After completing Sidewalk Iva Davies couldn't go wrong. Measure for Measure was a turning point for Icehouse. 'No Promises' is truely a beautiful song and the key song on the album. Leave off 'Regular Boys' and 'Lucky Me' and this album would no doubt be as good as 'Man of Colours'. The Live version of 'No Promises' is just as good as the studio version. You'll feel like your right there in the crowd. Hurry up and get a copy of Measure for Measure..it won't be in print much longer. ***You'll really want a top notch stereo too truly experience this album***
4,Completes the transition to a bigger sound,"The early Icehouse efforts were new wave but with Primitive Man, a move towards the mainstream started which continued with Sidewalk and Measure for Measure. By the time Man of Colours came around, they probably were too mainstream for me, although I had that album sent to me by an Australian pen-friend (remember those) on its release date and loved it.Measure for Measure is chock full of good songs, many of which stand the test of time. OK, it dates more than say Lloyd Cole but that's the type of music Icehouse produced. This is probably my favourite Icehouse album, and is still well worth a listen."
4,It was extremely touching.,This is definitely a girl movie. Quite a tearjerker at times. The relationsips in the movie are very easy to identify with. People actually have had those feelings.
2,"Ok, for under 2 but way too simple for over 2 when they're really learning to potty train...","I got this book because the reviews were pretty good overall. I also bought the Dora potty book, even though the reviews were just average. The Dora book is so much better than this one. I felt like this book was way too simple for my (JUST turned) 2 year old. It did not keep her attention. It didn't tell a story. It really only has 5 or 6 lines total. Like most kids her age, we're reading pretty 'big' stories to her (Pinkaliciious, Fancy Nancy, Ladybug Girl, etc) so for her to just have a picture board book with few words is just too basic. Maybe for a young child 12-18 months old where you wanted to start the conversation about what a potty is and how much fun it is then this would be ok."
4,Young toddler seems to love this book,"I decided to purchase this book to introduce the concept of using a potty to my 12 month old. It is one of her favorite books right now (and she has A LOT of books). The illustrations are really cute. It is pretty short, though. I do wish it had a few more pages."
4,Adam and Eve and Barnabas,"In the Dark Shadows DVD Collection 10, we continue with the story of Adam. Adam was a being created by Dr. Lang and Dr. Houffman to cure Barnabas of vamperism (similar to Frankenstein's monster). After discovering that his love, Carolyn, does not love him, Adam looks for a way to have Carolyn love him. The evil warlock, Nicholas Blair, uses Adam's want for Carolyn to love Adam to corrupt Adam. Nicholas even corrupts Adam enough to demand that a mate be created for Adam. Nicholas chooses the spirit of Danielle, an infamous murder from the French Revolution, to be the lifeforce.Nicholas's plan to create a super human race with Adam as the father seems to be working. As Nicholas corrupts Adam from one side, Eve corrupts him from the other.If you have watched the previous Dark Shadows DVD collections, this is of course a great way to follow through the story."
5,Dark Shadows Collection 10,This is a great DVD! This show is a lot better than the realty shows they have on today!
3,not as good as the original,"After my 1 year old played with some Legos at a friends, we decided to get our daughter her own set. Since the store was out of Legos, my husband decided these would be the same. Wrong! These are much larger and seem to be harder for our child to put together. They also don't stay attached as well as Legos. Yes, the colors are nice, but after 1 day my husband admitted he had erred, and we have since purchased some Legos, which our daughter loves! Her favorite thing about the Mega Bloks was the large bag they come in, which she immediately put on her head. (yes, that's bad and I took it away from her)."
5,Fun Toys!,"My son loves these blocks! This size is the perfect size for gift giving and the bags are so durable, that you can use them to store these bolcks again,and again, and again!"
5,Important book showing the impressive findings of psi research,"This is a good book about psi research. Dean Radin shows the research done up to that point showing findings beyond chance in tests of mental activity like telekinesis, telepathy, and precognition. He is very careful in laying out the case. The cynicism that abounds in the scientific community about psi warrants a cautious approach, however.Radin's new book Entangled Minds builds on this research, and should also be read; this book is a good primer, however."
1,not enough detail and too many ancedotes,"I do not believe the claim that ""psi"" phenomena have been scientifically established. Too many ancedotes -- useless for validation -- obscure the main point. Statistical treatment is weak; I believe the numerical results for the file drawer effect are wrong. If this is the best evidence ..."
2,THE CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE,"NOT TO BE TRUSTED. BUY ONE (ANY ONE 0F) AMIT GOSWAMI'S BOOKS INSTEAD.

3,one good chapter...,a intresting book...about the only good chapter in it is the hard data of parapyschology tests...although i do not fully believe it to be true it is a good matter to study to help science understandthe rest of the book is a mere attempt to attack skeptics and pyschologize them...a very weak form of argumentparaphyschology is an intresting subject and might have something to it....but 300 pages of attacking skeptics does nothing but show further expirements or evidence
3,Why No Easily Duplicable Tests?,"A reviewer of Radin's book asks; ""I am confused why this type of irrefutable evidence doesn't exist. Or does it exist, and the skeptics still denounce the results? Am I missing something here?""I suspect that the reason paranormal proponents rely so heavily on anecdotal claims, statistically equivocal experiments, and interpretively liberal mass consciousness claims, is that this is all they have. If they could confirm, say telekenisis, in a laboratory setting they would. But they can't."
1,"Scientific approach, but not convincing.","Most of the book presents anecdotes with no mention of how useless they are without controls. The author DOES attempt a scientific statistical analysis of published studies of psychic phenomena. However the crucial ""file drawer effect"" (the fact that studies with negative, neutral or inconclusive results are often not published) is not dealt with satisfactorily. The author simply asserts large values for the estimated number of studies that would have to languish unpublished to explain his statistical results, without giving the reasoning. These estimates (~10 to 1000 times the number of studies published) are obviously way too large: it is clear that unpublished studies numbering on the same order as those published would have a large effect on the results. If this is the best evidence for the reality of psychic phenomena, I don't see any reason to accept same."
4,"Clear, sound evidence for Psi!","At last! A book that provides clear, verifiable evidence for Psi, and not the usual New Age talk. This book details many Psi experiments and the results, drawn upon critical research. Though good and precise, it can be a little overbearing for laymen, with its many graphs and extensive explanation of statistical data and experimental conditions. A good purchase!"
3,Fun pool game with annoying sounds.,"First off, I really do enjoy this game. It is a nice way to pass the time on an airplane, and having all of the different game options beyond 8-ball and 9-ball helps keep it interesting. I think it's a great PSP game for people who enjoy pool.I do, however, have a few complaints:1. Really horribly annoying music. I turned it off after about 5 minutes.2. Really repetitive crowd noise. At first it was very amusing, but when you hear the same comment about 50 times in one game, the amusement fades. You can turn it off, but I like the idea and wish it had more variety.3. It is initially unclear how a ""win"" is recorded. I won a few games but then when I looked in the notebook I found that I had no wins recorded! It turns out that if you don't play until one of you wins 3 out of 5 you don't get the win. I didn't realize this, and when you select ""Stop Playing"" it does not warn you of this. Mildly annoying."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I did not know this was only going to be pool, I am not a pool player, neither is my son we hated it!"
2,Practice What You Preach + 2 other songs,"This CD has all the same cuts as Practice What You Preach with additions of tracks 3 and 11, which are from the compilation album Original Raw Soul Vol. 1 (1995) on Soulciety Records. Those 2 tracks are the baddest James Brownish tracks on the whole thing."
1,redefines unconvincing,"the main character is such a weiner that you will wish his dad had been more mean to him when he was younger. his transformation into hard man action guy is something to behold in a ""see how many ways we can make this not work"" kind of way. ***spoiler alert*** the twist on the twist at the end - sheesh. imagine if rambo had got to vietnam to rescue the gi joes who'd been left behind and it turned out the evil mastermind behind everything had been his own mum. that's the kind of twist we're talking about here. i will say, if you enjoy watching slow motion car crashes then you will get something out of this. i thought i was one of those people but this film has taught me a lesson."
4,This pedal rocks!,"Great distortion sound! I play bass, so I don't know how this sounds for guitar, but it sounds really cool if you want fuzz bass! The octave effect is cool, but it only works with the distortion on. You can't get a clean octave sound, so that was a slight bummer. Also, It would be nice if the octave switch was also a pushbutton footstomp switch like the distortion switch. Overall, I do like this pedal, and at the price it's a good deal!"
3,Pretty good...I think,"I am a bass player and was looking for an inexpensive octave up. At first I was extremely disappointed as the fuzz switch worked fine but no amount of fiddling could stop the weird oscillating tones that would happen when I flipped the octave switch. Switching the battery and using a wall plug did not help. Finally i dismantled it and checked all the connections of the inside and put it back together. Now it works perfectly and I'm totally satisfied. Wish I could have got it working before I dropped an extra $200 on an Ultimate Octave, but if you get a French Toast that actually works it is a good low dollar solution."
5,This is my favorite pedal !! Dano rocks !,"You can read other positive reviews about this to get so called technical opinions but I think when it comes to musicians that is very individual. So that being said This Pedal is not a metal brick and feels a little cheap on the build quality but that adds to the awesomeness of it. It has a crazy distortion that using multiple guitar and amp combos with it , the pedal always gave me some fun even running it through my bass rig. Its fun , its Fuzzy and it gets an almost indescribable synthetic sound when flipping the Octave switch. this will be a part of my rig from here on and I think I will pick up a backup.BOTTUM LINE : Heavy impact and unique sound from a $29.00 Pedal.A MUST HAVE !!"
2,ug,"the octave on this isnt very good. the distortion is ok, but i would go with the boss oc-3 or 2. that redal rocks hard."
5,A Must For Songbird Devotees,"Perfect voice. Perfect intonation. Masterful interpretation of lyrics. Impeccable musical taste. AND she swings! Buy everything by Sue Raney you can find! Then listen to the zillion-selling poseurs - you know who I mean - and marvel at how they are household words while Sue Raney is a cult artist at best. But then, if most Americans had taste and/or intelligence, Bush would never have made it past the 2000 primaries, would he?"
5,Sue Raney's Breathless,"Having had Sue Raney's first LPs with Nelson Riddle and Billy May in my collection since they were released in the late 1950s (and now the remastered combined CD!) it's a treat to get a compilation from recording sessions from the following decade when Sue was in her 20s. Her voice is now a little richer but that young freshness of the earlier sessions is still there. The backing groups comprise the Page Cavanagh Quartet and Septet, Shelly Manne and His Men and the Buddy de Franco Quartet. Most tracks are up-tempo with a couple of more reflective numbers, including a vocal and slower version of David Rose's Holiday for Strings, lyrics by Sammy Gallop. You won't be disappointed in the voice or backings."
3,"Alpha hydrox,anti wrinkle creme","Keeps skin soft,retinol content must be low,Haven`t noticed too much difference in skin.Absorbs well after application.Will continue to monitor results."
4,Gratifyingly huge,"This tube will last me a lifetime considering that you need just a dab for the eye area. It feels pretty light and doesn't smell too strong, although I have not noticed any significant reduction of wrinkles and fine lines within a month that I've been using it. Or maybe I just don't have enough of them to see anything significant. Going through the ingredient list, I was impressed to see a lot of good anti aging ingredients, but Parabens have to go."
3,Not sure if it works,"Pros: It didn't irritate my skin, it didn't smell bad, it was inexpensive to tryCons: It didn't seem like anything changed (but maybe my skin isn't at the point where change would be noticeable?), possibly had minor breakouts related to this lotion.I don't know that this did anything for me other than just act like any other moisturizer and clog my pores a little. I'll keep it in mind to try again in a couple of years when maybe my skin has matured enough that this might affect it."
3,Okay,"Okay, but not a miracle (haven't found one yet :). Did moisturize without being oily and wrinkles certainly aren't any worse than before I used the tube. I used it all, am still looking for something to help with these ugly creases above my lip. It has some highly recommended ingredients, but best for night use since has retinol."
2,At first I liked it,"The cream is smooth, unscented and non-greasy. It didn't dry out my skin and it didn't cause breakouts! (I have combination skin) I thought I had a winner! However, after going through a complete tube, I realized that the cream didn't work. It didn't moisturize, reduce wrinkles or fade age spots. Nothing. I've had other Alpha products and they are always excellent, this wrinkle cream just didn't work for me at all. Unless they tweak the formula, I wouldn't recommend."
2,Didn't work for me,"I'm 35 and my skin started showing some signs of aging. After reading about the benefits of Retinol and considering the low price and good reviews on this product I bought a tube of Retinol ResQ in my local Ulta store.I first used it on my chin, then on my forehead and above the upper lip. I didn't feel any burning or irritation. Encouraged by this one night I applied a thin layer on my cheeks. The next morning my face was covered with a small red rush. It could have been clogged pores, caused by emulsifying wax in this cream. Or that was my reaction to the retinol in this cream. The rush turned hard the following days and it took over a week for it to go away.I stopped using it and switched to Neutrogena, which doesn't irritate my skin, but also doesn't seem to work either.I'll try to use ResQ during my summer break, when I don't have to go to work :)"
5,Childhood,I got this as a reminder of one of my many favorable childhood memories. I was not dissapointed. Thumbs up
4,Michael Jacksons Moonwalker,"Ok folks, this has seriously got to be the weirdest film I have ever scene, it makes very little sence (if any at all). Basically you have just over an hour of great music, really cool dance sequences, some rather intriguing claymation and a mish mash of the things he his experienced and accomplished in his life to the 90's.Then it gets mondo bizzaro....the actual movie part..I mean yes the concept of fighting of drug lords and saving kids from the baddness of drugs is good...but turning into a robot and a space ship? WEIRD! I give it a four for the music and dance sequences but as to plot and story line..I was lost."
1,"Not at his best, to say the least","The MoonWalker video is very disappointing. I can promise you that I am the number one Michael Jackson fan. The smooth criminal video is incredible but the entire film is unnecessary. The video appears on History Volume II, so buy that one instead. The Dangerous Short Films and History Volume I are also both a lot better than Moonwalker. Even if you are an avid fan, I suggest buying all other M.J. videos before you even think about buying this one."
3,One big tease to anyone who's STILL a MJ fan!,"Man in the mirror is the only reason why I brought the video. Then to see him in concert... that was disappointing. Then I just seen clips of some of his greatest songs ever made. The video is a big tease to the imagination to those who will love to see, what Michael Jackson really was before he got himself caught up in all this trouble. I really regrett buying this. The best part of it is, Just leave me alone. Which I will do this tape."
2,This film deserves a review????????,"Michael Jackson's Moonwalker... ahh. The memories it destroys. This poor excuse for a bad movie is horrendous at best, and deserves a place in every campfire. The 2nd star is just because it's fun to watch burn."
5,Better than I expected.,Michael Jackson - Moonwalker (NTSC/Region 1)This DVD is awesome we enjoyed it tremendeously. The quality was very good. It was more than I expected. Don't let the Asain writng on the back scare you it is all in english. The only glinch was at the very end with the names and attributions were rolling. Buy it and enjoy.
5,moonwalker lover,I already had this on vhs but wanted a dvd version. I love the music videos of michael. Speed Demon shows Michael genius. The quality was great. I would recommend Moonwalker to any Michael Jackson fan.
5,BRILLIANT!! WELDONE MICHAEL JACKSON!!!,"An absolutely wonderful movie. A must have for any Michael Jackson fans or even non-fans. I especially love the Badder and Smooth Criminal sequences. I urge anyone who has not yet seen Moonwalker to find a copy, I guarentee you will not be disappointed. Once again WELL DONE MICHAEL!!"
1,Moonwalker,I could not review this product as they sent it to me in Region 2 - which I didn't understand would be unusable in my home. I have been fighting with the company ever since!
5,This is movie is very well done!,"This Movie is very well done! I am a True Michael Jackson Fan and i just love this movie i have the movie and i watch it again and again! the first part of the movie is about his videos that he made including Beat it, Bad (Kid's Version) Smooth Crimnal, make The Change and many more! Toward the end of the movie they have a shrot movie about this one guy that wants put all kids on drugs so michael has to save the day and Save three kids that are in danger on getting to be put on drugs!"
5,Moonwalker,Received order on time. Video was exactly as noted in description. Very happy with seller.
1,f****** terrible,"I am so hurt, I waited just shy of 1 month to recieve my dvd moonwalker and the dvd is completely in spanish and it cannot be played in ""this"" as it displays on the screen... my feelings are so hurt Deastore im no not purchasing anything else from you guys thanks for nothing! !!!"
5,Wow micheal,Every part of this movie just thrilled me from the preformance of the thriller musician micheal jackson. you gotta get this film
2,Mad customer,It said dvd and blue ray and I didnt get the dvd I just the blueray that was a rip off I'm really upset
5,It's Fab. What more could you expect from Michael Jackson?,"Michael's MoonWalker is a fabulous movie. It starts with little snipits from his life in music then goes into the movie. MICHAEL JACKSON THE KING OF POP. Michael is the music master of our life times. and there is no one who i will reason with if they disagree. so don't. Michael's new album comes out on November the 9th 99 so go to all the music shops and buy it. if you fail you suck.REMBER: ""Before You Judge Him Try Hard To Love Him""Love Becka Keep Loving Michael. By the way to all the tabloid people out there it's Jackson not Jacko!!!!!!!!"
5,Moonwalker still ROCKS!,"I never got the chance to get this on VHS way back. Finally now own this on DVD. It is so awesome, I could watch it over & over.Michael does a great job of acting. Full of action, music and imagination. I personally love ""Come Together"", ""Smooth Criminal"", and ""Speed Demon"""
3,"Come for the music, stay for the claymation","With any hard-core MJ fan, you can't go wrong with this movie..even through it makes basically NO sense whatsoever. Not really a movie, but more of some small plots superglued together with some really cool music videos.In between Michael excaping claymation groupies & paparazzi, he also battles drug lords, saves the children, destroys a 30s-era club with a machine gun (long Smooth Criminal video), turns into robots & cars & still has time to shake his thang wearing skin tight black leather pants & singing a cover of ""Come Together""....just another day for Michael Jackson.but let's get back to the MUSIC & even better let the VIDEOS to them. the highlights here are the videos, the long form Smooth Criminal video, featuring some of the BEST Michael Jackson dancing on film (imo anyways), the funky 80s-era special effects of Leave Me Alone."
4,"A bit of a mess, but the music is great!","Made when Michael Jackson was the biggest superstar in the world and before all that tabloid attention.To start off with, it features a video medley of all his greatest hits from when he was in the Jackson 5 and his solo career, then it moves on to the actuall hour-long movie, full of music and killer-coriography by non-other than the man himself.Most of the soundtrack is from his newest album at the time 'Bad', ofwhich 'Smooth Criminal' is the theme tune, though it does include tracks like 'Thriller', 'Billie Jean', Blame It On The Boogie' and 'Man In The Mirror', not to mention an extremly good cover of the Beatles' 'Come Together'.The entire movie in itself is a bit of a mess, but fans will love it for it's great music and dance."
1,What is it?,"Is it a movie? Is it a music video? Is it a freakish pederast's homage to the children he loves? Take my word for it (unless you're a kid and nothing I say will matter) -- find the ""Smooth Criminal"" dance number and skip the rest."
1,the worst thing i have bought in amazon,"expensive, took more than 20 days to get it and when it finnally arrived... it didn't work, its like a bad copy you make at home... My son, whom I bought it for as a present has not been able to finish seen it since it freezes 2 minutes into the video... I don't know if its worth sending it back, I don't want to spend a dime on it."
1,I wasted my time trying to get this,"When it got here , i was soo excited. I put it in the DVD Player...it didn't even work. Don't buy anything from this person , you'll only waste your time"
3,Miss interpreted,"I am happy w the purchase, however I was under the impression it was a 2 disc DVD that included blu ray. Still stoked about the product, just its not playable in my kids room where it counts. Delivery dragged...."
4,Love it!!!!!! It brings back so many memories from my childhood.,At first when I opened up the package it had Asian writing on it. Which made me freak out because I thought it would be in subtitle only. Except once I put it into my DVD player everything was in English. I loved watching it and everything is as I remember when my brothers and I would watch it growing up I'm 28 years old now. Overall this was a good buy and I'm glade I bought it.
4,Sweet,"Can't believe I haven't seen this until now. Yes, I do think this is mainly for MJ fans, others would probably find it silly. To me, it shows Michael at one of his best times, the BAD era. There is a certain sweetness that I don't think is faked. For those who don't know, there are video (sorry, short films) clips in the beginning with a very short retrospective look. It is just a sweet, simple reminder of Michael in a much better time in his life. Enjoy!"
4,"Great product, but had Korean writing","I was a little concerned when the DVD came because the entire description on the back was written in Korean. Fortunately, the DVD was compatible with the region I'm in, and it's been great."
2,moonwalker,it wasnt in english and I dont recall it being specified during the purchase. very frustrated with the whole thing
5,Great Movie,This movie is a must have for all Michael Jackson fans. This movie has great special effects along with a personal view on how Michael feels about the pressure of the media.
5,Last Christmas Gift,"This way a late Christmas gift for my Michael Jackson crazed son, he never no that MJ had a movie like this one so i was happy to find it in blu-ray. The movie got here fast, it came us mail and their was no problems."
5,Great Entertainment!!!!!!!,"This is my third time buying this DVD. After I received mine everybody wanted one so I did let everybody know where I purchased it.I did order the last two for gifts.I got these two dvds at a cheaper price than the first one. It's so much fun to watch, especially with my grandchildren. They absolutely love Michael Jackson and this was a new one for them to see. It didn't take long for me to receive.Thank you Seller"
1,said USA format but..,it wasnt region 1. so i sent it back and got a refund. it was packaged nice though.
2,Hi-fi VHS is better,"I was extremely disapointed, the video appears to be a copy (one to many times) from a standard definition video, however the sound portion was fine. I own a VHS copy and was attempting to upgrade, but this isn't the DVD."
1,Misleading Advertisement,"Amazon leads you to beleive this is a re-release of the original Moonwalker DVD, but it is NOT. It looks like an Asian bootleg copy. You are better off saving your money and watching one of the high defition uploads of it on YouTube."
3,DVD FOR THIS AND GHOSTS!,"MOONWALKER AND GHOSTS SHOULD BE RELEASED TO DVD, AND PROBABLY WILL BE.... NOW.Most people don't know about and have never seen GHOSTS.It was aired once around Halloween. A great 30 minute short film.You can see bad copies of it on youtube.Throw in CAPTAIN EO while you're releasing these two."
2,A Juvenile Effort!,"Truly NOT one of Michael Jackson's best efforts, with content bordering on the juvenile, it found me yawning and looking at my watch."
4,underrated side-scroller...,"this game was a lot better than i thought it would be. good length, challenging levels, and mixed in with the flying and fighting are levels where you snowboard and do some motorcycle stunts. not a bad gba game."
4,Flame On is a Cool game,"I bought this game when TRU was doing a special 2 for $30 during Christmas time. I look at the back and notice it was a sidescrolling type game which reminded me of Activision Iron Man game a few years back. Unlike Iron Man, this game was a whole lot better. I really enjoy playing this game. It captures the essence of being the Human Torch very well. I has no problem reccomending this game to anyone who is interested in buying it; especially at $19.99. It is a very fun game."
2,cookbook,"I was astounded when I received this book, or should I say booklet...it was NOT a book! It was sent on time and in a proper manner, so I can't say anything bad about that, but the size of the ""book"" was ridiculous!!!"
4,Kahlo Biography and Illustrations of Her Paintings,"The first 38 pages of this oversized book are devoted to a biography of Frida Kahlo's life and a discussion of some of her most famous paintings. Several vintage color and black & white photos are also included in this section. The remaining pages of this book are the plates...large full page images of her paintings reporduced in full color and detail...some of the best quality reproductions I've seen. Each painting is titled and dated, the medium used and the current whereabouts of the original piece."
2,"Great writing, but the content is pure fiction","...The book is a complete joke. Well, not completely but rather rather only the believability of the content. Nothing depicted here is anything but creative spin on already known information that has been available for centuries. The twists and stretches required to postulate such nonsense breaks under even a quick glance at the logic employed.Only spend your money on this book if you like conspiracy theory and are an avid mystery reader. As fiction, its not bad."
1,Literally hooey!,"When someone takes the time to write and publish a book with a title like this, one really has their hopes up to see what evidence they think they have. This book is a disappointing compilation of empty words.Please don't waste your money on it like I did. Borrow it from your local library first or look for it at a Half-price-book store if you just have to read it.Just one of the prophesied false shepards leading their sheep astray.For more accurate info, read ""The Signature of God""."
1,Poor scholarship leads to false conclusions,"Freke and Gandy commit a host of historical and logical errors in this work that leads to completely false conclusions. Whether you are a Christian or not, the issue with this book is its commission of numerous errors and assertions that have been proven false by scholarly historians. If you want to wrongly conclude and believe that the historical Jesus was nothing but a conglomeration of pagan gods, then this book is for you. But if you want the truth, then look elsewhere."
3,Gnostism Shouldn't be the Only Stop,"Despite what the authors said, the destruction of the evidence of the historical Christ was not total. As Robert Eisenman so exhaustively pointed out, the evidence for the historical Christ is still in existence through the ample historical record of the Christ's younger brother James the Just; appointed by the Christ himself as his heir and leader of the first Church of Jerusalem. The scholars have found that these true teachings of the Christ Jesus (as taught by James) were not of the sickly paganistic bent of the Gnostics, but was the original, uncompromisingly monotheistic faith of the patriarchs Abraham, Ishmael/Isaac and Jacob. Latching onto Gnosticism's paganism is a mistake that will only lead to a very, very warm and uncomfortable place. Worship the One God alone people. This will be best for you, if you but knew."
1,"NONE OF THE ABOVE, i.e., zero stars","I would have given it zero stars -- if that had been an option. Hence, none of the above.I find no enjoyment reviewing a book of this kind. I couldn't get through it and there is no point trying to enumerate the reasons why. The book's problems are too many and too deep to enumerate. Aside from the fact that it is poorly written, Freke's more fundamental problem is that he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. I shake my head in amazement that people will actually buy such twaddle. Readers who are sincerely looking for real answers about the rooots/origins of their own western spiritual tradition would do better to have a look at my own book, also posted here at amazon, Gnostic Secrets of the Naassenes.A word to the wise: Don't waste your money on Freke."
5,A revolutionary book,"I read this book this September(for 15 days).This book was known to me through a book this August16 for thefirst time.So I had some knowledge of the content of the book, but wantedto read the original. After getting it, i started delvinginto the masterpiece. As for me, a lot of ambiguous parts inthe Bible seemed to disappear.I thihk the book is very convinc-ing.While reading, i felt several raptures. Of course, it is verydifficult to decide whether the historical Jesus was or not.I venture to agree to the authors' view."
4,"The answer is ""yes""","Excellent research into topic. Sometimes overbearing in the minuteness of detail; however, addresses the subject with dispassionate scholarship."
5,Must Read!,"Everyone should read this book. The information explains so much about the foundations of Christianity. Most will be surprised to learn the origins of their belief systems, i.e., plagiarized stories and fables."
2,Speculation posing as research,Probably better researched than Christ Conspiracy by Acharya S.still not the book we hoped it would be.
2,an opinion,"To be fair, I am not a fan of this book, but I have decided to revisit it lately. It fails on two basic levels: an understanding of theology; and an understanding of history. There is absolutely no understanding of culture and religion and how these work in a society. The authors have a tendancy to confuse philosophy and religion.In terms of histiography, its pretty poor. This book is filled with wild conclusions on shaky evidence. They also have a tendancy to misquote and to take out of context."
4,a book with huge information about the 1. century CE.,"I took this book with me during holidays, travelling around Iceland and it was much fun to read it. This is a book, easy to read, with huge information about the 1.century CE and common beliefs in those days. The book has a good bibliography and notes to all pages, as also informations about who's who, for those who haven't learned a lot in church history. At the end of each chapters there are conclusions which makes it easier for the reader to grasp the chapters ideas. When reading this book it is obvious that the writers are very well educated and there is much to think about so I will definately be reading it again and again. What we are dealing with here is the idea that Jesus was originally a myth and never a historical figure. So I think this is more a book for skeptics and scholars, than for those who take the Bible seriously."
5,Amazingly referenced,"The authors have been denegrated by others because of their lack of appropriate background. I don't care what their expertise is, they make the best presentation of any theory that I have ever seen. They're not just making stuff up; nearly every statement has a reference to back it up--almost 1500 footnotes in all, many with further comments.If you can't keep an open mind, pass it by. If you can, you are bound to learn something that may challenge your beliefs. This book should be in every seminary: If you can successfully refute all of Freke and Gandy's points, you should be a minister or priest and the gates of hell shall not prevail against you!"
5,Great Book!,"I really loved reading this book, then I bought ""Jesus and the Lost Goddess"" by the same author, and it was good, but this one is better. If you enjoy this book, you should also read Freke and Gandy's book called ""The Second Coming."" It's very different, they seemed to be having more fun writing that one. I think they did all their heavy research in the earlier books and then decided to lighten up a little! I have to say, the ""Jesus rant of 2000 years of pent up rage"" at the end of the Second Coming book is worth the entire price alone!!!! I recommend reading this book, as well as the others they've written."
4,VERY DANGEROUS BOOK! Christians beware unless you want to question your belief,"A very revealing book. Appears to be very well researched & alot of facts brought to the table. If youre done with your sugar coated Christian or religious lifestyle, youve got to read this book!Socrates said "" A life un-examined is not worth living""- You MUST question what you believe in order to grow!Trust me, if you keep reading books that support your current belief system, you'll never grow & your truly not using the brain that God gave you to use. This books yields the power for to to gain a new perspective & insight through well documented & written facts. It certainly opened up my closed eyes to consider new & different possibilities!"
2,Interesting to say the least. I feel my eyes are opened as,"As I was saying, I feel as if my eyes are open now. You seethey don't teach these facts of history in bible school, privatetutoring or in public school history classes. I suppose thesefacts of no literature found until the 4th or 5th century CE(common era) regarding anything about Jesus would have causesome problems with all the kids asking questions and thenproviding dates and all.I wish more scholars could actually get there works up to the status of TOP TEN or #1 NEW YORK BEST SELLERS list. People haveread thousands of those, but I seriously doubt any have readanything like this book. I will now be looking for moreon this Jesus subject, besides the 3 versions that I've readof that Bible.Cordially, Sin etc.Me, myself and Ialways, bye-bye-now"
1,The Jesus Mysteries/ Jesus and the Lost Goddess,My psychic elucidated my poignant odysseys of The Jesus Mysteries and Jesus and the Lost Goddess. Freke and Gandy compare history to fiction in these books. There was an historical Jesus; there was never an historical Osiris/Dionysus. The mythology of the Greeks and Romans was designed by the ancients to explain the unexplainable in their physical world. How could a serious student of ancient mysteries be impressed by this rambling? The authors have compared apples to oranges by placing side by side-- as though equivalent in value--the historical Jesus and the mythological fiction of the ancients as though both bear the same validity. This is ludicrous and not serious literature. It is also misleading to customers who are genuinely searching for answers and knowledge.
1,One of the most ridculous books ever written,This book suggests that Jesus never existed. Almost every historian knows that Jesus was a real person based upon evidence which includes other writings from his time besides the Bible. The question should really be if you believe he is the Messiah or not. Not a question of his existence. This alone proves to me that the authors have no credibility whatsoever. Amen
1,"save your time, save your money","The authors offer nothing new. Rather, they spend a lot of time congratulating themselves on what a great job they have done and reciting the list of other books they have written that they think are just super and that you should also buy. They also seem to resent the amount of money other others (lesser authors, in their opinion) have made writing about the same subject. - It is not funny. It is not now. It's not much of anything. So save your time and save your money."
1,Gnostic Apologetics,"Most of the previous reviewers have shown the incredible amount of flaws and misquotes that these authors have inbedded into this gnostic text.Honestly, just look at the evidence. Everything in this book is eaisly refuted by anyone who searches a bit into it. The authors didn't count on the readers actually RESEARCHING their extensive bibliography, which shows outdated soruces and bits and pieces that are taken out of context.Most of their claims are purley speculative, and can eaisly be turned around on their own gnostic beliefs.The Bible has withstood the test of time, scrutinty, and historical authentification.This can't even withstand the Amazon.com review section.Unless you're a gnostic fundamentalist and need this as a utterley flawed reassurance that you're not getting into the wrong thing, don't waste your money with this book. There are far better on the subject, with far better credentials."
5,Challenging Read!,"I think the authors did a great job writing this. Whether or not Jesus really existed, I don't think anyone will ever know, but, the author's idea of the way it might have happened does make good sense! The bottom line is, the New Testament is not God authored, but man authored. Too many contradictions and editing have proved this by most scholars. The fact that Jesus' life cannot be proven historically cannot be ignored. This book brings to light what might have happened in the birth of Christianity...and it makes sense!"
5,"entertaining, life-changing read","what an eye opener. this was a great introduction into the subject matter. i thought it was entertaining and informative, and well written. i didn't expect this to turn out to be such a page-turner."
4,"Was he, or Wasn't he?","THE JESUS MYSTERIES by Timothy Freke & Peter Gandy is probably the best- known new take on the Pagan origins of the Jesus Cult. It is a scholarly and engaging work that takes the reader back through mythic time to trace the many lines that lead directly to the construction of what was to become the doctrine of the early church. There are particularly interesting allusions to the ancient Egyptian religion & the Cult of Isis and her son Horus (the Sun God. The image of Isis suckling the babe Horus was obviously the artistic inspiration for the Christian Madonna & Child. The allegorical basis of this idea is reinforced by the fact that in myth Isis was said to have conceived her son following the death of her husband Osiris--in other words, a Virgin Birth.The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics"
4,Easy to read theory on Christianity,"I doubt this book broke any new ground, but at least the writers spent more time telling you the facts than explaining how they procured them. I've read a couple of books on this topic before and they spent too much time explaining how they went about their research. I didn't find that horribly interesting. The constant use of exclamation points annoyed me and some of the prose was a bit too breathless, but those are minor quibbles. If you are interested in this topic but don't want to have to wade through pages that only academics would be interested in, this is for you."
1,Boring and needless,"If you don't believe in Jesus, no big deal, just don't be complaining about him when he drops you in the lake of fire.These clowns cannot offer anything better than Christianity, paganism is a sure way to get your soul damned and damned good and proper.Jesus taught that God loves us and wants to help us, what's wrong with that?I enjoy indian food, a fine wine and pleasant conversation.Thanks."
4,Freke and Gandy did a superb job with TJMWTOJAPG,"Interesting, stimulating, fast paced, tightly reasoned, very well documented, good end notes are words and phrases I use to describe why Freke and Gandy did a superb job with TJMWTOJAPG. This book is a fine addition to my library. I liked it so much, I've bought ""Jesus and the Lost Goddess"" as well. My only gripe is that the book's bibliography lacks page number cross references. This book clearly establishes the plausibility and likelihood of a Jesus Mysteries origin of Christianity. I give this book four stars and a definite thumbs up."
3,the ole' bait and switch,I felt this book started out well enough but half way through it changed. The authors seem to be promoting the Gnostic faith. I would suggest to the reader to borrow this book from a friend or go to the libary and check it out.
1,Jesus Mysteries,"The authors took Sir James Frazer's ""Golden Bough"" to ridiculous extremes. They set a new record by revealing their bias not in the first page, but on the dedication page! This half-baked bit of scholarship somehow manages to combine Osiris and the Greek god of ecstasy Dionysius into one being, despite the inconvenient fact that they are two separatre and distinct deities from different cultures, and there is no reason to do it whatsoever. The work then plods through a buffet of Near Eastern religions and cults, grabbing on to anything which even remotely resembles gospel accounts and considers it as absolute evidence that all of Christianity is a fraud. Pagan philosophers are called 'sages' while early Christian wirters, saying much the same thing, are referred to as 'mouthpieces'. While the authors concentrate on surface details, the major differences between minor fertillity deities and Jesus are completely overlooked."
2,Two books in one,"The first half is intriguing, and make several good points, but the second half drops the topic entirely and becomes a harrangue about all the errors in the New Teastament. Watch the proliferation of exclamation points, always a sign that an author is on a soapbox."
2,Not great.,"It reads more like a novellette based on circumstancial evidence rather than facts and proof, and though the subject matter is interesting, anyone with half a brain and a decent command of mythology can see the cultural similarities between Christ and figures like Mithras, Dionysus, Etc. They don't go far beyond the obvious and lack strength to thier argument.In other words, there are better books on the subject."
1,wow,"this is the most unscholarly book i've ever read in my life.jesus never existed?Paul didn't write timothy or titus?Paul was a Gnostic?no scholar (Christian or non) who holds any credit in the field of theology would say something so ridiculous.each chapter is jammed packed with information and a bunch of it is cited in about 30 pages of foot notes. however, the only source deemed worthy enough for them to include in the chapter was Celsus (a pagan philosopher). his name is referred to a bunch of times in a weak effort to prove their claims, which simply don't exist.if you want a good laugh, grab this book. however, if you're looking for any sort of historical accuracy, there's much better stuff out there."
4,Disturbing for Christians,"No doubt devout Christians will find the thesis disturbing, but the data presented cannot be ignored and the conclusions should be given objective consideration. The Jesus Mysteries presents many facts and their ramifications few have heard, especially those who have not previously ventured far from the dogma of traditional, or ""Literalist,"" Christianity. The book is heavily cited with a long list of references. Definitely worth the read!"
5,Pure Wonderful Wodehouse,"Have you ever come across a P.G. Wodehouse story that isn't an absolute delight? No, and this one is no different. Wodehouse is a master with words, creating a single sentence that can have you on the floor laughing hysterically. His plots, at first glance, seem unconnected but by the end, everything works out so beautifully it's almost stunning. Not only do things work out so nicely, but it's also great fun getting there. An especially great book for a nice Sunday afternoon..."
5,Outstanding!,"Outstanding book!many of the mames mentioned, Rionda's, etc., are family members!Many thanks for documenting Family History!!Juan L. Garcia-Tunon"
2,too unreal and loosely composed,"The book was exciting, it was some interesting happenings, But those of the characters where hopeless. The godly otherwordly family father who has been a coward all his life and never fought suddenly becomes a super warrior. blargh.it is a book only for the really fanaticly interested shadow world gamers"
1,More Trash,if i could gie this less than one star i would trust me...the stroy line terrible only on attractive guy in the whole movie and the sex scenes less then gratifying...
4,Great CD for 80s music lovers,"I love this CD...it brings me right back to the New Wave music era. I bought it because I always loved the haunting ""Vienna"", and found the other tracks were great...especially if you love the genre."
3,A satisfactory group of songs.,"I recently just bought this complilation from Ultravox. Strange enough, I don't remember these guys or the music they put out before buying this album. I've always liked synth music, especially Duran Duran and A Flock of Seagulls. I'm not that crazy about this CD though. More than half of the songs on here are just not engaging and don't grab me. The songs I do think that are better than the rest are ""Dancing with Tears in My Eyes,"" ""Hymn,"" and ""Reap the Wild Wind."" The singer of this group is good and does a nice job. The synth playing is also interesting and there's no doubt that these are good musicians. I just think their songwriting is mostly just average though. I was surprised that there was not a history of the band in the pages of the CD booklet, but there are quite a few photos. This isn't a group that I'm a big fan of, but this CD is worth a listen. It has some good moments here and there."
3,Nice flowers but...,"The quality is not good as I expected, too thin and strong smell. Only the flower design is very nice!"
2,Wimpy Ballet Bag,"My daughter loves this bag. However, it is very flimsy. It does not hold the rectangular shape at all. Also, the strap is long, and often difficult for my [...] to use."
4,"If you're riding a horse and it dies, get off","Those that have given this book poor reviews obviously do not work in public education or have taken the book too seriously. Constructed around the old saying of ""don't beat a dead horse"" this book illustrates that there comes a time when you must recognize that the proverbial horse is dead and you must move on to a new horse, or in a broader sense, way of thinking. This book is excellent for staff development and illustrating that it is often important to step back from a problem and think outside of the box. It is a perfect illustration of the old saying ""if you do what you have always done, you will get what you have always got"" only with some humorous educational examples. Simple, but to the point."
3,New Strategies for New Students,"This book, though some have found it unhelpful at best and offensive at worst, is a great analogy on the ways at which those outside of education think we should fix education.We teachers know that raising standards, forming a committe or throwing money at a problem is not going to fix it.Teaching is hard work and this book emphasizes the need to find new strategies for the new population of students that are in our schools. I encourage educators to use this book to brainstorm ways to help all students and not rely on how things have always been done!"
1,"Not funny and not helpful, why bother?","Possibly the dumbest book that I've ever read... Why anyone would recommend it I have no idea. I question whether or not Forsten and Grant have ever been in a public school or seen the inside of a principal's office. This dimwitted oversimplification of the educational process and its problems is neither innovative nor humorous. It does little more that point out the obvious, that the world is full of idiots who cry and point fingers when they don't have real solutions.Public school teachers should teach in golden palaces, be paid salaries higher than rock stars and all drive hybrid Hummers to work. Write me a book that tells me how to do that and I'll buy it. In the mean time, read some Dr. Seuss, get an original thought, and learn how to solve some problems."
1,Junk!,"This thing is such an absolute piece of junk!After reading a few reviews, it seems people have bought this camera long ago and are still satisfied. Well, that's fine. You know what the problem is though? This industry has come pretty far in two years. This camera was a good buy at the time, now it's just an outdated dinosaur.You'll likely get better image quality on the ""Barbie"" digital camera than this one. Look elsewhere.Of course, if this is for a teenager and you can find it cheaper than 199 somewhere then it could be worth it for a play-around/junk camera."
2,imac unfriendly,"imac owners beware! the necessary cable is not provided for the imac, which they don't tell you and don't seem to make either."
5,I still use it!,"While I have to use it with an old computer because it is no longer supported for XP and beyond, it has never failed me. It continues to work just as good as the day I got it in 1999! I love my AGFA!"
2,Not very satisfied,"As a technology consultant, I recommend, test and purchase computer related equipment for people who find it difficult or time consuming to do it themselves. I purchased this camera for a real estate agent who wants to take pictures of homes and e-mail them to potential customers. I had two problems with the camera. 1) The data connector is similar to a headphone jack and I had to wiggle it to make a connection to the PC. 2) The quality is only appropriate for pictures you intend to post on the web. I will recommend that my client spend more money for a megapixel camera."
2,wasted batteries,"I bought this camera over a year ago and it was a good camera for that short period of time and the price was right,but there's not much difference in price for this piece for junk it drains the batteries everytime i download pictures from the camera.And you can't even upgrade the smart media card."
3,"Okay for the money, but...","One important thing to note that was not mentioned in the product spec's: the camera has four resolution settings, which take up variable amounts of memory. At the lowest resolution setting, the camera can store up to 96 photos, but the images are pretty lousy. At the highest res setting, the images are great but the camera can only store up to TWELVE (12) photos. Unless you want to lug a PC around, you will probably need to buy additional memory cards."
1,Compatibility,I purchased this camera and sent it back after spending 10 hours trying to connect it to my computer. I tried 3 different computers and when I called customer support that is only available 8 - 5; M-F and they suggested that I had a bad cable but couldn't be sure so I would have to wait 7 - 10 days for a solution to my problem. (The cable is not available through any standard camera stores or office supply stores.) This obviously defeat the purpose of buying a digital camera so I sent it back after only having it for a week. I am very computer savvy and have been able to work with a Kodak camera with out any problem. My frustration came from the lack of customer service from the company to help me solve the problem quickly. I need the pictures for a marketing piece that deadlined the next day. I ended up going to Wolf Camera in Littleton where they were able to extract the pictures for me on a piece of equipment that would have otherwise cost me $100.00 just to retrieve the pictures.
4,great,This was a great knife. It is durable and works great! I gave it as a gift and he uses it all the time. It is compact and works really good.
3,middle of the road,"Nice looking knife. Wicked sharp from the factory. Nice opening action. Nice lock.Crappy plastic handle. They call it zytel but is just crappy plastic, nothing more nothing less. The booklet that ships with it says this knife is available with a machined aluminum handle...look for that one.I bought this knife because it was a respectable brand made in the USA. Now that I have it I feel like it would break in my hands under any stress. It probably wont break, but it feels like it could. I have an old poorly made chinese knife that feels more durable than this. That should speak volumes to future buyers and to SOG if they ever read this.For 50$ I wish I had bought something else. Something that was all metal. The product would be 5 stars out of 5 if the handle was metal."
2,A huge let down...,Well I was so thrilled about getting this knife...but when it arrived; I was completely disappointed by the blades not so sharp blade and the over-all cheap feel of the knife. I mean c'mon I own a $20 Kershaw knife thats made better than this knife and my little Kershaws blade is way sharper! Hell I have a $26 Gerber knife thats sharper than this SOG. I just feel like I got played for my money with this purchase. Don't get me wrong i still like SOG knives and I own atleast 8 or 9 but this Flash II is a let down IMHO. It looks cool but that's about it!
4,Cool looking knife,"I must admit I bought two of these knifes for my sons because they looked cool. I don't need any more knives so it was a good excuse to start the boys off with something fun. These knives open smooth, fast and easy. They lock tight with zero wiggle. You can lock the blade when closed and it locks automatically when open."
3,"uneven, overly romantic performance","Maria Kliegel is a master of cello playing. Her Naxos recordings are a treasurer-trove of incredible performances at a budget price. Her Kodaly sonata rivals Starker's, her Shostakovich concerti and Brahms sonatas rival Rostropovich. So it is with great reluctance that I must criticize this CD. What Kliegel can't seem to do is change her style of playing from the aformentioned Romantic works for these lighter classical pieces. The same romantic sound, complete with dark rich vibrato and dramatic shifts, simply doesn't work for Haydn. One can give an excellent performance of these concerti without being an expert in historical performance, but one still has to make concessions to the style and not play them as if they're Dvorak. In addition, it's always hit-or-miss with Naxos' orchestras, and this is a bad miss. The quality of sound is weak, with moments of highly questionable intonation. Skip this one."
4,Great clamps unless you're a pro,"Great clamps for the average Joe like me. True working lenghts are nice. Read some negative reviews that the handles were sticky and didn't turn well when screwing the clamp down. When I got them they were a little sticky, I put some paste wax on the threads and now they work great. 5 stars for price - 3 stars for quality (average) so 4 star total. Won't find more clamps with this kind of capacity for the money anywhere. I am ordering another set."
2,I Burn For You,"Easy book to get lost in for the day, but nothing amazing. Save your money and check it out at your local library."
2,Literary Minute Man,"I enjoyed this novel very much -- the sexual tension between the hero and heroine was exquisite and the ""bite"" scenes very erotic (something I find far too many vampire romance authors shy away from). However, there is one major issue that, for me, turned the book from a 4.5 star to a 2 ... and that is the lack of denounement. The book ends on a very heavy action scene, with no resolution of the romantic conflict between the hero and the heroine -- the literary equivalent of being left unsatisfied by a one minute man.Otherwise, the book is incredibly good ... but judging by the ""foreplay,"" I expected much more out of the finish than I actually received"
4,Not bad,"I like the story but the ending did not pack much of a punch. It was as if the author just ran out of steam. While the over all storyline was good, the ending was a little disappointing."
2,Rather dissapointed,"I purchased this book due to the high reviews it got on this page and was very dissapointed with it. It was a light read but the plot left a lot to be desired. It had too many excessive characters and felt very forced and stunted. It seemed as if the author either wanted to just finish the book, make it longer, or write a sequel. So much more could have been done with it. Very dissapointing."
1,I'd be willing to burn the book,"Although I rarely read contemporary romances, the reviews made this sound like a good possibility. I managed to finish it. But it required effort. This book is more adventure/thriller and lust than romance, and the thriller part is not urgent enough to keep the pages turning and is too quickly resolved to justify its word count.The relationship between Alec and Domini is never given emotional depth, and Domini seems to readily give up all her previous views on life at the end. Sizemore simply did not make me believe in them as a couple."
1,Burn it,"<groans, rolls eyes and sticks tongue out> This is a really BADromance novel. I finished it only because I had paid good money for it. I bought it because it was supposed to be about vampires. Ha! The author spent a lot of time trying to make the main male character look like a complete badass. What female could resist that right? <ack, barf> It made him into a jerk and the female lead knew it. In fact all the way through the book she keeps saying he's a jerk and that she didn't know why she kept having sex with him (again ha!). Of course she completely changes her mind on the last 2 pages of the story and decides that he is her soul mate and she will live the rest of her now immortal life with him. <again, ack and barf> I was so anxious to get to the end of this book that I skipped a page towards the end to help move it along. I then discovered I had skipped the entire climatic ending!"
2,"No burning, more like indigestion.",I was very disappointed in this book. I've heard great things about the author and the premise looked interesting but that's where the excitement ended. I wanted to like the main characters but they seemed so flat. By the middle of the book I couldn't have care less if they got together or not. I think that there should have been less hopeless lusting and more details of the story.
4,Unique Take on the Origin of Vampires,"I love the universe Sizemore creates with vampires coming from a planet and tribes rather then a denomic origin. I also like the scifi aspect of there being medicines to control their ""allergy"" to sunlight. The romance and chemistry btween the two characters is hot and their road to matehood is fascinating."
2,Not Spectacular,"I have to admit i was expecting a lot more form this movie, and its preformers. The acting was not as great as other preformances i have seen these actors in, and the story line was not portrayed very well in my opinion. It is something to watch on a very rainy sunday."
2,After school special,"There were some good ideas here and some good acting. Channing does her usual fine work and Silver manages to avoid being too sensitive. The whole film really depends on the character of Jack and I'm afraid Anton Yelchin can't pull it off. He has a strangely disconnected affect, almost as if he were practicing for a self-deprecating stand-up routine about his kooky family. His pain never becomes believable and so the piece mostly moves by and you wind up observing it, but no more than that."
3,NYC Underground Party 4 is better!,"I purchased both Ultra Dance vol.1 as well as Louie DeVito & Bad Boy Joe's ""NYC Underground Party Vol.4""...and there is no comparison. Although I feel that Johnny Vicious is probably one of the best remixers out there....this non-stop club mix is only mediocre. On the other hand Louie DeVito with the assistance of the phenomenal multi-track/multi-editing skills of Bad Boy Joe, has released a much tighter and more energy packed mix. If you are looking to purchase a more mainstream/top 40 mix of todays hits....Louie DeVito and Bad Boy Joe are the team to look for."
5,A most wonderful book! never goes out of date!,If you are going to homestead ---get a small farm---live off land or just survive this is the book. if nothing else ---IT IS A GREAT READ.
5,Wonderfully Informitable,"This is a great book for the novis or experienced person finding themselves living in the country or even in the city, but wanting to learn what country life is or was all about. If you ever wanted to know how great grandma ever milked a cow or goat, made cheese, butchered a hog, tanned a hide or made soap this is the book for you. It's all in there step by step."
3,Good stuff - small amount,"I really was enjoying this product until I realized the very small container was empty. 14 days later. Now I know that some people have a heavy hand when applying creams. I know better.The problem with this cream is that you cannot tell from the little bottle whether or not you are using it all up. You can't see inside. That is a problem.It seems to work well enough in providing moisture under my eyes without being irritating or smelling bad. But since it didn't last very long, I guess I'll never know the long term benefits since I'm not likely to buy more in the future."
1,Burning sensation,"I really wanted to like this product, but to no avail.Last night I applied the Jason eye cream and within 15min my eyes were on fire. It felt as if I had rubbed in chilly oil. I immediately washed my eyes but the damage was done. Two RED, PUFFY eyes. This morning I had to go to work, and it's my birthday thank you, with red, puffy eyes that has started to flake and peel too. I guess I will be enjoying my birthday party tonight in a Halloween costume.I understand the people react differently to cosmetic products, but how a product marketed as: ""best and most effective natural products in the marketplace."" (quoting Jason's website) can bring such a harsh and vile result is beyond me. And I don't even have allergic or very sensitive skin.Shame on you for pushing products, loaded with harsh chemicals as ""natural products"".Two thumbs down."
1,Unreliable affiliate,"Normally I hate Amazon reviews that are about the shipping experience rather than the product, but since I'm not the first to have this problem I think customers should know. The item arrived without the ""feet"" that are supposed to prevent damage to the roof and floor of the cargo area. The box was beaten up and opened & re-taped--I don't care about how the packaging looks, but it means that it's not the factory losing parts but the company reselling the barrier. Amazon's affiliate for this product apparently regularly ships incomplete barriers, and I would recommend not purchasing from them."
5,Works well to keep my German Shepherd puppy safe in the back of the Volvo wagon!,Good price compared to what the Volvo dealership wanted for their barrier! I did have to replace the screws that came with the product as they did not sufficiently hold the horizontal bars in place.
2,Flimsy,This product is pretty flimsy. Our dog knocks it down on an regular basis. The feet also don't seem to want to stay on the legs.
1,don't bother doing business with this company,"First, I received a damaged box, with incomplete parts. I returned it (yes, free return shipping, but it's still time consuming to repackage and drive over to drop off), and asked for a replacement.Replacement arrived - the box was even more banged up than before, and obviously opened (ripped open is more like it). Different missing parts this time.Returned it for a full refund, and will NOT do business with this company again."
1,"Missing Parts, Twice!","When I received this product it was missing one of the vertical bars. So I returned it to Amazon for a replacement. When I received the replacement it was missing one of the rubber feet. Two Strikes and your out, when it comes to product quality!"
4,Not bad,"Although it's considered ""universal"" it does not fit very well. But it still does what it's supposed to."
2,not worth the time,"The only good thing about this book is the use of the narrator being dead and discussing his short life and after life, other wise the book has a terrible ending and leaves you with a feeling that you just wasted you're time reading it."
2,Everything but the strap!,"I loved this bag because of the compartments and it cradled my Canon Rebel T2i perfectly and held small accessories I needed HOWEVER... The strap is horrendously made for a woman. You don't see a front picture of that woman with that bag do you? Only when it's swung around... that's because the strap rests uncomfortably and tightly below the breast and it is very awkward. It also kept slipping because of my anatomy and the top of the strap was slicing into my neck. This is a perfect bag for a man, but women - stay away."
3,"Great Design, but a little snug","When my boyfriend gave me my first SLR I wanted to get this bag because he had it too. (Not because we are one of those matchy matchy couples, but because I liked the ease of use and portability of it.) The bag arrived and I was so excited to use it! It really is designed to fit comfortably but I found that it was like HALF the size of my boyfriends. I didn't send it back because I am just an armature at photography so my equipment list is rather small, but still the two lenses I have and flash and body fit REALLY tight in the bag. It is my fault for not realizing that there were big differences in the velocity style. The bag serves it's purpose and I still take it EVERYWHERE, but if I get more equipment I will definitely have to upgrade in size."
2,Not the one i wanted,It s too small for a dslrAlmost impossible to put an extra lens in itIt barely carries the camera with it s charger
2,Too Small,"This seemed to be a very nice bag, but it really was too small. I only put my camera in it and it was snug. I also felt that it was a little top-heavy like it would tip over and my camera would fall out."
3,"Nice design, but too small for DSLR","I purchased this bag thinking it would be perfect for my new DSLR. Unfortunately, my entry-level Canon XTi fits too snug in this bag...and for those of you familiar with this camera, you know that this is the smallest DSLR out there along with the D40/D40X . The top zipper was holding on for dear life when I tried to squeeze the camera strap in there with the camera.I quickly returned this bag and upgraded to the Velocity 7x 5767 instead. The 7x will also give me a chance to expand my lens collection being able to hold a 50 prime and basic telephoto lens."
5,Good travel camera bag,"While it takes a bit to get used to it since I have never owned a sling type bag. I found it was very comfortable once you did. I received the bag and immediately went on a 14 day trip and carried the bag almost everyday. It was very easy to retrieve the camera from the bag, snap pictures, then put away and move on."
4,Convenient travel case,"Took this case on a cruise to Alaska. Very convenient, kept my camera dry. Wish I'd bought the slightly larger 7x as space inside the case was pretty tight."
3,snug fit,"This bag BARELY fits my D80 with the 18-200 lens attached. My camera strap has to be shoved into a compartment under the camera. It is rather awkward. It is a light little bag that I can sling over my shoulder on my way out the door. I like that about it, I just wish it was a little bigger."
3,"I don't like products with too much fragrance, ...","I don't like products with too much fragrance, so this one was a pleasant surprise with its light odor. It's a good-foaming soap IF you use a pouf. On a washcloth, it lathers poorly. I didn't feel particularly invigorated or moisturized, as the label suggested I might. Still, it was a pleasant enough soap, though not one I'll purchase regularly."
4,Not an easy read BUT an excellent reference,This is not a book to read straight thru; you don't sit down after dinner and take this up as something to read and refresh your skills. It is a handbook. A book to refer to. A book to use on site at work. In that light it is excellent and the only reason it received 4 stars was I could not download the queries nor did they come with the book on a diskette or some electronic media. I found this to be an unfortunate flaw in an otherwise good cookbook to have on hand.
2,Oracle 8 Tuning,The book does not add anything over the Professional Series Oracle 8 Tuning Book. Hits a lot of topics superficially. I was expecting a book like this to dig deeper than the Professional Series based on the experience of the authors. Consider this book an abbreviation of the Professional Series meant for the non-professional public. Cost is also about half the cost of the professional series books. This review is appropriate for the Oracle Press books in general. Frank Davis --- Oracle8 Certified Database Admininstrator
4,BEST BOOK / SQL TUNING & PERFORMANCE.,"I have purchased many Oracle books but this one is one of the best. Recommended to advance users(DBA/Developer's)...... Very well explained examples, enough detail about the syntax used in SQL tuning. Covers all the important topics of Oracle8 tuning and performance such as partitioning table, Parallel Queries, Explain Plan, TKPROF, SQL Trace and performance pack of Oracle Applications. This is a review from an Oracle Instructor and Consultant."
2,This book needs tuning!,"This book is simply a re-hash of their previous Oracle7 book. The book is simplistic and full of mis-statements, inaccuracies, and completely wrong information. Use this book at your own risk, because you will be risking the performance of your database. These ""experts"" certainly are not!"
2,only 75% down,"Advertised as a down pillow, but the inner tag says, ""minimum 75% down"". This pillow is not as soft as down pillows I have bought in the past. It feels more like a feather pillow."
3,Meh . . .,"These pillows are not that great. They are pillows. Sleeping on them is not like sleeping on a cloud or anything. They kind of go flat, but they can be massaged back into fluffiness - I think they are designed that way. See, my gram has a feather pillow that is filled to the brim. You wake up and you feel like your entire body is relaxed and perfectly rested.You can't feel the down, which is a good thing. I think this pillow is a little soft and goes flat a little too easily. It is an interesting feeling when you head sinks into them, though. It is also nice to finally have kind-sized pillows for my king-sized bed.For the price, I would not say these are worth it. I bought two but I'm not complaining. I like my pillows to be stuffed more so your head sinks but there is some bounce. The sadness of experiencing the best . . ."
3,Downgraded initial rating,"After 3 years of service there is nothing left to this pillow. I expected it to last longer. Not sure if it's because they don't make em like they used to, or if I should have bought a fuller pillow that would squish down to where I like it after a year of use.March 2009: if you like very low pillows, this is for you. I can sleep with no pillow at all. Meaning I use a pillow for the softness, not necessarily to prop my head higher. If you are like me then this pillow is perfect: fluffy, soft, not too full. Can use even if you are a stomach sleeper."
2,Not great,I was disappointed in the quality of the pillow. The odor from the feathers was dreadful. I have purchased many down pillows before of good quality and they were void of this smell. Obviously the feathers were not cleaned.
4,Nice low fill down pill,"This is a nice low-fill down pillow for the money. It's probably designed for stomach sleepers or others who want a thinner, flatter pillow. Others will be disappointed ... look at one of the other pillows, there are others in this line - search on Royal Velvet Goose Down.They come with a fairly nice pillow cover, which is essential and saves you having to buy them.Didn't notice any smell."
5,Great for nesting,"These are real down pillows, not feather pillows. Down pillows are much softer than feather pillows. And they don't poke you with quills.We sleep with 8 to 10 down pillows on our bed (it varies because the kids are always stealing our pillows).If you are the type of person who likes to snuggle into a big, soft, fluffy nest when you go to bed, pure down pillows like these are what you want.I picked up a pair during Amazon's Friday sale for less than twenty bucks each. I wish I'd ordered more."
4,Nice pillows!,"I got these for a steal at only $19.98 on one of Amazon's Friday sales. No problems with these pillows, in fact they seem to be made quite well. It is true that these pillows dont have much fill but that is clearly mentioned in the item description. The lesser fill makes it easier to squish and mush these pillows how you want them, which I like to do when getting comfortable. And as for the ""smell of geese"" that others mention in their reviews, its non-existent... they smell like normal pillows."
5,I loved them so much I bought 12 of these pillows,It is incredible to get this quality of pillow for the price. I bought the original 4 in a buy 3 get 1 free deal. Then I later purchased 4 more for my family and then again 4 more for myself and my friends. When they first arrived they had a bit of an odor but this disappeared within 24 hours of being out of the bag. I highly recommend these pillows for the price.
1,very lacking for the price,"I bought this pillow as I always sleep on feather pillows. For the price I would not consider this a good value. While it is soft, once you you put your head on it to sleep, it's less than 2"" thick and not comfortable. I paid $28.99 for it, wish I had paid less. Lands End is a better item for the price, this was disappointing."
4,Not full and fluffy if that's what you're looking for,"As some of the other reviews have said.....if you're looking for a thick, fluffy pillow, this is NOT the one for you. It works for me ..... I've had surgery on my neck and I can mold it exactly as I need it so the low loft is good for me. Hope this is helpful because there's no sense in wasting $27 if you don't have to!"
2,Ok pillows but for the price you can do better,"For the price of these pillows I expected them to be a lot larger. They're fine for their size, and very comfortable. But simply just too small. My mistake for not reading all the specs. My advice - go to Linens and Things and buy pillows instead of getting these."
2,They smell and are way too low.,These pillows fluff up nice but will have to be used on top of others. They also smell of chemicals.
5,Christmas Gift,"This was purchased around two years ago as a gift for my boyfriend. He always liked how soft my feather/down pillows were and I decided to purchase him one, even though he is someone who is just as happy to sleep without a pillow. The pillow is very soft and light. I realized that it doesn't seem to be filled quite as much as some of my pillows though. That, however, ended up working out just fine because he doesn't like his head propped up that much anyway. After two years it seems to be aging okay. All in all, this is a great pillow, if you like laying closer to the mattress."
5,Ahhhh,"This pillow is real luxury. Not only does it have the right amount of support and comfort, the fabric is so soft. What impressed me most, however, is the quality of construction."
5,Wonderful!,"One of the best buys I have ever made. I was so happy with my two, I ordered two for my daughter, my step-daughter and my Mother. We all loved them!"
5,Royal Velvet down pillows - great value!,"As another reviewer said, I ""keep coming back for more"", having bought the queen version of these pillows a year ago, and just a few weeks ago the king size. These pillows are really nice - fluffy and full. I combine these with the Royal Velvet Silver pillows (Royal Velvet Silver 400-Thread Count Cotton Damask Stripe King European White Down Pillow) and really like the combo. The Silver pillows are a bit more expensive, but outrageously filled and luxurious... I use them as the base and then these pillows as the pillow I rest my head on. I think two pillows of as filled/fluffy as the Silver Elegance would be too much (my head about be, oh, 2 feet off the bed?!).The covering material is also very nice, and the down has no odor. Also, no flying down escaping from the well-constructed pillow. And finally, if there are feathers in this pillow, I haven't noticed them...Overall, excellent pillow and well worth a try, and a great value at this price!"
2,deerslayer,this is the worst feather pillow I've ever had! I would not recommend this unless you like REALY flat pillows!
4,okay but mack has done better,oklay mack 10 left cash money the beats are tight but sound odd hey things change he don't need timbaland and the cash money millionaires on here though they should stick to their own thing worth a l.isten if you're a mack 10 fan.
5,A MONSTER,"I was thinking of getting one from the Orange store for 199, but I decided to buy this one because of the steel grates....I have benn using it for 10 months maybe 2 or 3 times per week, and its in great shape....Very good Quality."
3,"Disappointing, but there's saving grace","Keith goes into testosterone overload and brainlessness with the ""Red White and Blue"" but ""Beer for My Horses"" alone saves this otherwise mediocre album. One must hope that Toby will give up the tight-fisted, eye rolling attempt to be patriotic and return to real C&W."
1,Bring back the old Toby,"Toby Keith is probably my favorite artist in country music today, but when I heard his new album, I wondered what had happened to the guy who recorded his previous six albums. Toby tries a different style of country music on this disc, and while I am all for artistic experimentation, I realize that it fails miserably sometimes. Unfortunately this is one of those times. All three singles are horribly laden with influences of pop music a la Shania Twain, and the rest of the disc is nowhere near up to par with Toby's previous efforts. Bring back the old Toby please!!!!"
3,Muscle flexing,It seems like almost everyone's gotten on the 9/11 bandwagon and Toby Keith didn't want to get left out. Released 8 months after the bombings his anger rings a little hollow. Jingoism is not an attractive quality in a country or a country singer.
1,a begrudged 1 star for this waste of time,"I think this moron needs a boot up his own ass, for he in no way deserves to rake in the millions of dollars he does from ignorant fist-pumping yahoo's who foolishy confuse his well-marketed trash for music. If sticking boots up people's asses is the American way than I don't want to be American. Luckily, it's not - just in the dillusion mind of this hillbilly no-talent. He needs to get a clue about what being an American really means - and maybe stop promoting vengence and bloodlust as an ideal."
1,"If this is America, we should be ashamed.","Patriotic? American? Give me Lee Greenwood or Alan Jackson anyday. There's a way to do it via your music without coming off arrogant, boorish and juvenile.This is nothing but jingoistic trash playing to right wing national machoism. I hope the world doesn't hear this and think Americans are a bunch of immature buffoons. Alas, we maybe too late."
1,Tragedy sells albums!,"No one will say anything positive came out of the 9/11 terrorism, but they'll gladly profit off it.There's nothing American about dashing off a song with grade school lyrics and inspired by blind anger, jingoism and a case of beer. Is it American to profit off of the 9/11 victims? But it sells, so we don't question it.Donate the money you might waste on this, there are far better causes than Mr. Keith's pocket. If music be the food of love, this album is the food of dungflies.But there's no accounting for taste is there?"
1,Sell Out Songs,"I used to like this guy, but this album is a dud. His macho posturing is so lame -- does country music even need songs like this anymore? After listening to the first song, it changed from being something patriotic to something thoughtlessly aggressive. He sure doesn't speak for me as an American.The other songs just begin to sound like sell-out pastiches of other older country singers. This album turned me off Toby Keith completely."
1,Banal stupidity for toothless trailer park trash,This loser is exactly why 95% of the world hates America.
5,American Patriot,"Okay folks let's face it. ""Courtesy of the Red, White & Blue"" and ""Beer for My Horses"" are the two best songs on here, I think.Maybe it's because I'm from Texas and we Texans don't take kindly to foreign freaks attacking us, but I totally agree with every line written by Toby Keith in this powerfully patriotic song. Try to remember the aftermath of September 11th: the overwhelming surge of patriotism and the ""we will NEVER forget"" attitude. Aside from the present-day views of Iraq and the war on terror, Sept. 11th is almost a whole separate ordeal. This song was written in the aftermath of a very terrible event and to me, it reaffirms the pride that we Americans have in our country...and those who mess with us are gonna get ""a boot up their ass.""I applaud Toby for putting it so plainly. He's saying what I believe we as Americans were thinking, that as the greatest country in the world, we will overcome (and we have)"
5,Great CD!!,"I think Toby's cd is awesome! The songs are great. My favorites from Unleashed are: Courtesy Of The Red, White, And Blue (The Angry American), Good To Go To Mexico, Beer For My Horses, Ain't It Just Like You, and Rodeo Moon.""The Angry American"", Good To Go To Mexico, and Beer For My Horses - I like these 3 songs because there upbeat and I like the lyrics. Every time I listen to them I find myself singing along.Ain't It Just Like You and Rodeo Moon - I like these songs because, well I don't know why I just do. Ain't It Just Like You is also a type of up beat song, but not the type as the 3 above. I don't really like slow songs, but Rodeo Moon is exception. This a great slow song. It makes me feel like I am in the setting of the song.Anyways, all in all I think Toby's cd is great! I listen to it all the time. I don't think that you will be sorry if you bought Unleashed. If you are then there is something wrong with ya! lol."
1,I have good news & bad news...,"The good news is that if you liked other TK cds, you'll probably like this one. The bad news is that it's really quite awful. Toby's voice is flat & he uses that wavering effect as if that's going to hide the fact! The lyrics on this disc are so bad that they actually make me laugh. As in most modern country, the production is way too polished, and it also sounds very thin. The musicians are fine, but there's no spark to their performances. The whole cd is a very ho-hum affair, but I guess that's what sells country music these days. Like I said before, if you're a TK fan, you can't go wrong with this release. But if you're into classic country like me, stick with those Marty Robbins, Merle Haggard & Buck Owens discs!"
4,Great Album,"It's a shame that people like Nick from Boston and A Music Fan From Michigan think that you're either ""white trash"" or a ""redneck"" to support America the way that Toby Keith has on this album. Don't listen to those [...] who look down upon Americans who like to show a little patriotism. Go buy the album to tell record companies that you like artists who are willing to stand up for our country."
5,He won me over!,"I can't say I've been a big country fan but Toby Keith has won me over! The Angry American expressed how many American's felt after 9-11. In a world of ""political correctness"", I found this to most refreshing.For the critic who titled his critique ""Toothless Trailer Park Trash"", you are IGNORANT to Middle America! You insinuate that anyone who listens to country music is trash? We know this cd has driven those on the left crazy. I'm glad an artist like Toby Keith has the courage to put this out and take the punches."
1,Why do these stupid celebritiesget political?,"I'm so sick of these rich celebrities feeling like they have the right to talk about American foreign policy, it's absolutely ridiculous. People like Toby Keith should shut up about American foreign policy because they don't know anything about it. I used to enjoy his music, but his turn towards jingoistic support of American policies has sickened me. He's just as bad as Bill O'Reilly, Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, Michael Moore, that guy who's making Michael Moore Hates America, and Barbara Streisand. So SHUT UP TOBY, I don't care what you think!"
1,Toby Keith- a TRUE American.... Idiot!,"I remember reading a book in 5th Grade called Stories from Wayside School where it had a particular passage that sums up Mr. America's attitude immensely:""It's amazing how a person can be right all the time and yet still be wrong.""Words I live by to this day, thanks to people like this. Oh and a little message in closing to the music world of Nashville: You talk about how your wife/husband left you, how they did you wrong, how you're down and out, etc, etc, etc. Well, did you ever stop and wonder that the reason all of this might be IS BECAUSE YOU LIKE TO DRINK ALL THE TIME? Wow, what a crazyconcept!!!! (rolls eyes)Bottom line, if you're looking for enlightenment, look elsewhere. And if you're looking for post 9/11 music, try Bruce Springsteen's The River.See Ya!"
1,The Ken Doll of Country Music Throws a Hissy Fit,"Ten years after the phrase ""Who's your daddy?"" peaked, Toby Keith stumbles across it. Never the smartest, or the best singer, the Ken Doll of Country Music does his best to come off genuine, real, enraged even. While we might buy that from the great Johnny Cash and certainly George Straight could pull it off, with Keith it comes off like a hissy fit.His singing, as always, is ragged and frequently flat. But then the Ken Doll of Country isn't about the voice, it's about the ""la vida loca"" ways that dancing boy shakes his hips in those vids. Since you never quite believe for a minute that Keith has any idea what he's singing about maybe it's unfair to point out that ""Beers for My Horse"" appears to be a pro-lynching song. At least guest vocalist Willie Nelson sings in tune.Keith's the Billy Ray Cyrus who just won't go away. ""The Angry American""? No, just the Ken doll of country music throwing a hissy fit."
5,Unleased - Toby Keith,"There are terrific songs on this CD, including the controversial ""The Angry American - Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue"" which is an extremely powerful song that I think Keith skillfully reminds people, who are not and may never be ready to forget the thousands of people lost in NYC, PA and VA - that there is resolve not only to come to terms with what happened on September 11, but also, that there is a profound resolve to do the things so that it will not happen again. A recommend buy if for nothing other than ""The Angry American"" but also for the other 11 great songs."
4,WHO NEEDS LOVE ALL THE TIME????,"I would think that someone that can sing about love along with other subject is a talent. This album is good stuff....I do not need love all the time . Having another topic of songs such as patriots and fun is uplifting to hear anytime of the day. I think someone that sings only of love should wide'n their topics line. No regrets here,Great beats and lyrics!"
5,GO TOBY!!!,"If you are a country music fan and love your country you will love this c.d. I have been a Toby fan for years and can tell you this is his best so far in my opinion. My husband is in the military and I can tell you right now ""The Angry American, Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue"" says it all. That song explains how we all felt after September 11th. Everytime I hear that song I realize how important a job my husband has. Thank you Toby!!! Of course there are other fantastic songs for example, Who's your Daddy?. Also love ""It works for me"", ""Rock you Baby"" and ""Ain't it just like You?"" Also have to mention ""Good to go to Mexico"", and the duet with the one and only Willie Nelson, ""Beer for my horses"". In a nutshell, GET THIS C.D., you will not regret it!!!"
3,Average,I have bought every 2007 GED book. The McGraw Hill and Kaplan book are the best. The material in this book is not very good in my opinion. You get what you pay for.
3,Good but not the best,"Unless you are purchasing this book for a 7th grade level test prep book, save your money and purchase the McGraw-Hill GED edition instead. While Cracking The GED is laid back and humorous and does teach the process of elimination very well, there is more to studying for the GED exam than this book entails."
5,poker chips,Im enjoying my poker chip set very much. I received very good service and a prompt delivery. Thank you very much.
4,good deal,"I think it's a good deal, the price reduced a lot and the qolity is pretty dulex. The only one bad thing is, it doesn't have the chip called small and big dealer. We'll have to use a replaced item."
2,They will do,Very unsatisfied with the case. It was very cheap and the locks were very fragile.The chips are pritty good.
3,...and that's all for Tony,We all know the one and only reason behind this semi porn flick is Tony Ward -- The Original Bad Boy credited by 10 Men #23 Autumn 2010. Almost the rest of the casts and performances goes to the two diminished stars above.
2,Alright if you have nothing better to do,"Another almost good film that got lost in itself. I was expecting more from this movie, but again just another ""Hustler White"" in sheeps clothing. Not much more to say besides that, it's not really worth it unless someone else you know is renting it then, and then I say to see it, but only if you're not paying for the rental. :("
1,Still waiting to receive it!!!!,"Ordered at 2th February .......still waiting!!!!Must say, it's the first time in many years I've troubles with an Amazon order.AlicePS. Stupid! I have to rate before able to send my review! How can I rate something I haven't got."
5,Motre than What It Appears to Be!,"Ever since I saw this film as a high school kid, I have been drawn back to it from time to time. That's because it is not really the typical cheezy horror film of the 1950s, but a deeply philosophical exploration of life and its meaning. Does that sound like I've gone overboard? See this film, ponder the ending, and make up your own mind. This one is surely more than what it appears to be."
5,Old SiFi Movie,"What can I say, this is one of the great old SiFi movies of the 50's and I have been after it for some time now. Only wish it were available in DVD. Hopefully in the future it will, but until then, I will keep watching this version."
4,"Large Format Laser Disc, Symbolism in this Film, DVD? Please","This was such a riveting Movie. It was broadcast on TV in the 70'sin Los Angeles.Saw this on a laser disc player at the Sonoma State University library.I've though alot about this film, for me the story can be looked at from a point of view that this man is dying, hence fading from the world, his journey to the hearafter...shrinking toward infinity, awsome ending showing the back yard, whirlpool galaxy with his exceptance of oblivion.I hope that it gets transfered to DVD. Not on DVD, thats why 4 stars.Would pay over $15.00 for a good DVD repro."
5,AN INCREDIBLE FILM! CREAM OF THE SCI-FI CROP!,"The term Sci-Fi has gotten such a bad rap, that we can not even mention it without thinking of one of those hokey 50's drive-in movies. 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' is a 50's science fiction movie that is a very interesting, intelligent story with excellent special effects(for the most part). An engrossing film from beginning to end, anyone who loves movies should enjoy this exceptional treat! The DVD transfer is excellent on the The Ultimate Sci-Fi classic collection volume one. It is the only release to DVD at this time. This one is heads above the crowd."
1,Dry and boring,"Geez, I thought with all these 5 star reviews that I would at least find some part of this book to be interesting --- but I did NOT. It was filled with boring stats that do not at all relate to why I homeschool. I believe many of these reviews to be a hoax because the people only rated this one book. Amazon, can't you help us to have true ratings? Spend your money elsewhere and pass this book by."
5,"Finally, answers to real questions","As the grandmother of homeschooled children, I am often asked my opinion of the decision their parents have made. Casual observers and those seriously considering home education for their own families want to know ""Does it work, are the kids doing well?"". With this book I can point people to well researched answers to their questions, rather than just, ""well, I know a family who...."" which was my previous response."
3,Good Record Ruined by Overproduction,"First of all I have to say this is a fundamentally good record. Each band member shows that they are technically compotent and the songwriting is well done. However, whoever produced this must have had a ""hair band"" in mind here. The entire production seems overly clean and polished. The production kills all the meotion this record had. 4 stars for the music but only 2 for the production."
5,I want more Armored Saint,I wore out my vinyl record and cassettes of AS in the 80's and 90's. They were my inspiration for athletics and music. I only wish they would get back together so I could spend more cash listening to John and the crew playing my type of music!
4,Tick collar,"This product works really well. I would have given it 5 stars, but I think that it could have more of a repellent property. It kills the ticks and we have noticed a marked decrease in live ticks on the dogs. Weather is not a factor here in South Florida, so it's not the winter that's helping."
4,Good Product,I have used this product before when I bought it from my vet. It definitely keeps the tics away. Good price too!
2,"Good, but has a short life...","It's been one month since I purchased the Preventic collars. Our dog was infested with ticks. Within 24 hours the ticks were gone. It was great. However, according to the literature with the package, no new ticks were supposed attach to the dog. That wasn't the case. They did attach, but they would die within 24 hours. So, the ticks were still being brought into the house. Additionally, within 3 weeks the collar had lost its effectiveness. I literally pulled about 40 ticks off of our dog! Not fun. So, I used the second collar. It's working great right now, but how long is it going to last? By the way, the first collar never got wet, so there was no reason for it to lose its effectiveness. I don't know why the collar was uneffective after just 3 weeks. The box had an expiration date of July 2008. I don't mind the cost of using a new collar each month, but they really should last a lot longer than 3 weeks."
1,Watch out!!,My dogs still got ticks and one dog got lymes which almost killed her. I recommend getting the drops you can purchase. They are alot more money but the vet bills you may get are really high!!!
2,"Good product, poor vendor","We've used these products for years with great success. We live in a heavily wooded area and the tic collars work. However, we bought several of these to be able to get us through a season. When they arrived, we saw that they expired before the season was over. Assuming they would work for an extra month or two, we kept them. Bad decision. The expiration on the box matched when our dogs started coming in with tics. If you can get away with ordering them as you use them, fine. Do NOT try to stock up with this vendor to save on shipping/hassle."
3,A thought provoking work,"The vehemence of the condemnation of this work should be sufficient proof its content. This work is by no means completely revolutionary or perfectly written. Its style is typical of these persuasive pseudo-academic works. Fortunately, it does not use the cryptic writing style utilized by most of the academic elite.Anyone who speaks with a professor in a women's studies class, or anyone who has taken a women's studies class knows full well something is very wrong with feminism today. While this work might have a political bent, it raises important questions that need to be addressed. The time has come to look at people as individuals, not as members of a group.If that does not happen, most men of good character do not want to have anything to do with feminist women coming from major universities."
1,I am throwing this book in the trash,"Someone gave me this book because I am a book seller, right here and elsewhere. I took a look at it and was shocked...I wonder what kind of woman felt the need to trash every famous feminist on earth...and then I decided Christina Hoff Sommers was really a man. So in the trash it goes..too bad for you whatever man who is so afraid fo women who wrote this book. Nobody else is reading this copy."
1,"Reality Check, lady","Hmmmm, a female published author who hates feminism. Ms. Hoff-Sommers, if it wasn't for feminism, you would be BEATEN for having written a book, BEATEN for knowing how to read and write, and BEATEN for having an education. Next time youwant to write a book, thank your sisters who DIED so you can write a book trashing all the things they did you you!"
5,Destroys many feminist lies with wit and logic,"One can argue about Sommers is a ""feminist"" or not, but she shatters many of the lies spread by radical feminists. Contrary to their fables, she does deal fairly and scholarly with their arguments - she just reaches the ""wrong"" conclusions. This should be near the top of a very short list of books worth reading on feminism."
4,A *very* Feminist Book,"I don't understand either the feminists who claim that this book is evil for bashing feminism, nor the anti-feminists who think this book is a weapon against feminists. This book IS feminist, and is *written* by a feminist.This books invites women to question, investigate, defy, think independantly and to be skeptical, logical, assertive, fair, cool-headed, scientific, and to stand boldly in the face of criticism. It invites women to make partnerships with worthy men, and to stop associating the worst of human traits with average, everyday men. I can think of nothing more Feminist."
1,Badly researched and undocumented,"Hoff Summers had to withdraw one edition of this book from publication due to egregious errors in logic and fact. The rest of the book is not much better. She cherrypicks her data, uses outdated studies, jumps to stereotypical conclusions, and basically says all the stuff that feminist-bashing conservatives love. Basically, she blames feminists for everything, and she's got the conservative 'research' to prove it.It would be amusing, it's so obvious, but at least liking this book serves to warn you about a person's intellect."
2,Remember You will get what you pay for,"Poorly manufactured. The handle will not turn easily and every turn you will feel a bump. Overall the poor quality will remind you what you have paid. Don't get it if you are going to use them for years. If you are planning to make only one or two wood projects, it might serve the purpose."
1,NOT worth the cheap price,There are numerous inexpensive aluminum u-channel bar clamps out there and I figured they were all inexpensive. These are downright CHEAP and I'm not talking about the price only. They twist while clamping and and the screw is so rough it's hard to turn. Lube doesn't really help.Don't purchase these clamps!
2,disappointment,"Bought these as a birthday gift and was not impressed. Only three clamps in the box and the mechanism was very jerky. I realise that these are low-end clamps, but i would never purchase them again."
3,ok for lightweight,Ok lightweight clamps. Shipment came split three clamps in each box. Had to request second box be shipped. Amazon came through after comparison of box size and weight to short reach set which came six to the box.
5,great album!!,"what i enjoyed the most about this cd is the music arrangements. the sound is great and the songs are even better. this cd has music for everyone who enjoys Banda- style songs like Rancheras, corridos, balads & dancing. I also recommend their previous albums like Musica Romantica & Quiero que Seas Tu."
4,"Good color in pictures, slow USB implementation","I have taken over 2,200 pictures with this camera and I am amazed of the quality. Even pictures that I didn't think would come up due to poor lighting come out excellent. The medium resolution is my favorite. It gives the best balance between picture size and storage.The USB interface allows you to drag the photos from the camera to your computer. You just highlight all the pictures and drag them to the folder you want to store them in. It transfered each image fast but there is a long pause between each picture. I purchased a USB card reader and it copies about 15 times faster.Basically don't think that the USB interface for the Kodak means fast downloads, it will be just as slow as serial (or even slower)."
1,Things you don't know until you buy and try.,My wife gave me this camera as a birthday gift. I went through two full sets of batteries before I got half way through the instruction manual. What an energy hog! While the camera was fairly easy to learn to operate the software that came with it was HORRIBLE. I'm an experienced computer professional and this was some of the worst software I'd ever seen. I was ready to throw the camera against the wall. Even the 'free' photo image software that came with the Kodak camera software was FOUR VERSIONS past the current version. The camera is now safely back where my wife bought it and the credit card is waiting for our next choice. Not sure what to buy but the Kodak 260 isn't it.
4,Kodak 260,"The Kodak 260 is a good camera. It has a zoom feature to include exclude things you do not want in a picture. It also gives you the choice of selecting the picture quality based on how you are going to use the pictures (i.e. on screen, 5x7's, 8x10's, etc.) This allows you to increase/decrease the number of pictures you can take before being required to upload or change memory modules. All the selections can be made on the camera using the onscreen display. The camera has a lot of functions and can also transfer picture using the infra-red connector. It comes with software and cables to connect to your computer in the case that you don't have an infra-red port. Overall I would rate this camera 4 of 5 stars."
4,Excellent camera,"The picture quality of this camera is fantastic! I've taken over 2,000 pictures with it and nearly everyone has been as good as film. I even took pictures of fireworks in DC and it had no problems adjusting to the lighting. It's a little slow writing pictures to Compact Flash at times. At the low res setting, you have to wait about 6 seconds after every 4 pictures. Other than that, this is a great camera."
2,not so good,"i has read a review of someone talking about ""the great"" software interface...yes, i think its great when do you dont use the letter that the software assign to the camera!!! i was instaled the cam, and later, plug a new HD and installed programs there... then, is very hard to uninstall/reinstall all programs cause a new HD letter assignament, then... i try to move the camera letter...I CANT!! and kodak, have a solution... MOVE YOUR HD LETTER.im now reinstalling programs like ""websphere studio"", ""MS VC++ 6"" and other heavy disk load :("
4,Awesome toy,"I take mine scuba diving, and one of the things I love about it is using the ""Instant Fix"" button in Adobe PhotoDeluxe to bring up all the ""hidden"" colours (everything appears blue or green underwater). But the one thing I hate is the delay between pressing the button, and taking the picture. It can be very hard to stay still for that long when there's a swell! I use NiMH rechargable batteries, and they last for 2-3 dives/day if I don't use the LCD screen."
4,Cutest Shoes in the Class!,"These really are a great dance shoe! Especially for Zumba! Just make sure you order 1 1/2 sizes up from normal street shoe. Also, the color is CREAM!!!!! They look white ( or off-white ) in the picture, but they really are cream. Like canvas! But who cares!!!!!! I get more compliments on them than any other shoe I've worn. They kinda look like a bowling shoe!!! This shoe makes spins and turns a breeze! Highly Recommend!!!"
3,"slow, repetitive, kind of boring","a friend burned this album for me, as he knows i'm a fan of such bands as earth, sleep, khanate, etc. sunn 0))) is an earth tribute band. they admit to it. and they sound like earth. almost exactly like earth, in fact; they're slow-motion sludge metal without drums. it was cool the first time it was done, now it's just kind of boring. the later tracks on this cd are better than the earlier ones, especially the two mixed by merzbow, however, these tracks end up sounding more like merzbow than sunn 0))). i listen to this very rarely. stick with earth's first two albums."
5,Please listen to a Sunn Fan,i have been a sunn 0))) fan for a few years now and i totally disagree with all the bad stuff people is saying about this album...YES it is hard to listen to ..YES most of you Wont Like...YES its the best thing sunn has released until black one was releasedits a solid album but sometimes the merzbow tracks get boring and i skip them but i never skip them until i have heard the symphony of chainsaw as you get sucked into the black hole...possibly the greatest thing i have ever heardif you have any musical taste and are open minded this could be a ever lasting reward
1,Very poor.,"My daughter got this thing for Christmas and it's a nightmare for me. The streaks don't wash out. I tried washing them out and now she has a tangled nightmare. Don't use the streaks or wash the dolls hair! If you buy or get this thing, throw away the hair paint immediately or the doll will be an ugly diappointment."
1,What a Piece of Junk!!,"Warning...Do not Buy this!! My 8 year old daughter has wanted a toy like this for years...she finally gets one for Christmas...takes it out of the box, and the arm falls off! The glue-like substance at the break is even wet. Toys-R-Us can not even keep these things together at their factories apparently! Then the jewelry, piece after piece just falls apart. Pathetic. Cheap Plastic, stones falling out of ""jewelry"" and the tops of the rings fall off the ring's loop!Save your money, and your child's feelings...I did save the box, and it is going back!Shame on you Toys-r-Us!"
2,mal......mal......,"en este, gilberto......la cagó.no es malo, pero tampoco es bueno.el tema ""nos barracos da cidade"" está pegadizo,pero este no es un disco muy agradable de escuchar.escuchen esto solo como una curiosidad,y solo después de haber escuchado todo lo demás, porque este es el peor disco de gilberto gil"
3,Review,"I think the authors captured the essence of the region well. There are however some russian recipies mixed in, but that understandable as Uzbekistan was part of the Soviet Union and the mix of cultures occured."
3,I LIKE IT,"I garden from a wheelchair, so this handy tool is perfect for chopping out dandilions and other weeds without all the bending. I use mine a lot, so I'm not too suprised that by the end of the season my tool is pretty much shot and I need to get a new one every year! I do wish they were built a little sturdier without being any heavier."
4,Video Now,"For children who love The Wiggles its a wonderful thing to be able to take them anywhere. I purchased the Video Now for our 17 month old to entertaine her on an airplane trip. I think that she will enjoy this much more when she's just a little older. She knows how to work the buttons, but I don't think she understands exactly what they do yet. The best advise I can give to anyone who purchases a Video Now for their child is when you see a video that you like, BUY IT!! They are very hard to find."
4,"Versatile, multifaceted.","Hey, he made Wendy O Williams sound good. Check out his Edgar Winterscollaborations. ""Autumn"" is a beautiful love gone bad/done me wrong ballad. What a talent."
3,Non-Cookie Cutter Race,"I believe that Mr. Gate's objective is to show that there is no cookie cutter that determines the personality of a Black man in the 1990's and 2000's. He has accomplished that. Read this right after Troopergate, to find out who this Louis Gates guy is. The book was a reader's digest sketch of various Blacks that apparently Mr. Gates had interviewed during his career. Very surface biography. Maybe that's what people want. Too cursory for me personally."
3,Its not what it looks like,"On Christmas day I got a Wii and I got most of what I wanted except two games. I went down to my game rental store. I wanted to rent call of duty 3 and Red Steel. They didn't have call of duty so I rented Red Steel. I got home and when I started playing it it was fun, spraying people with uzis, but as I got into the later levels, I was discouraged any shooter could do well on the Wii. This game gets EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING and its run and gun formula gets old. Enemies aren't courteous enough to stay on screen, sword fights get old and levels are unoriginal. In conclusion, this is a last gen leftover no next-gen gamer should buy"
4,"Great Game, must buy","Overall this game is fun. I played it at my cousins and yes it is different which makes it fun. However, it does take a little while to get use to but it is fun and i would recommend it. I gave it a 4 star because one a wii is required which is hard to get right now, and two the controls could be a little annoying/getting used to."
4,Red Steel Wii,"If you are a fan of a shooter game, you should think about getting this ame. There is alot of good action. You are a body gaurd and your client and girlfriend gets kidnaped and basicly you are going around doing missions for Japanese gang leaders building up your respect and trying to save your girlfriend, by shooting everybody in sight. Good luck Scott-san!"
3,once you get past the learning curve its a good game,"Dont expect the world and u wont be let down. Multiplayer is limited, but if your looking for a game to go along with Zelda I would say this is an ok bet."
3,too little or too much,"This is a fun game but the aim is sensitive. If you put it on medium sens. it is really, really sensitive. If you put it on low it's not at all. Other than that it's a great game."
5,How Much Fun is This,This game is pretty awesome. I really like the shooting and sword fighting. The only think that I didn't like is if you play to long you will get dizzy. Just play in shifts and you will be fine. Overall this game rocks. Hope they make a two.
3,it wasnt bad,"i rented this game at blockbuster and one big problem was the control sensitivity. i would try to aim at a guy and then i would do a 360 degree turn, while the guy was shooting at me. another thing was that the graphics could have been a bit better. other than that, its a great game"
3,High learning curve,"The graphics are rich and detailed, but I found it easy to overlook enemies at times due to the richness. Also, the Wii remote did not respond as I expected, so many times I was stuck against a wall and trying to turn around to fight but dying instead. Basically, you would have to spend a lot of time getting the moves and how the remote responds down just right in order to even try enjoying the game. I gave up after half an hour."
2,DON'T BUY THIS GAME,"OK, I know that many of you have been waiting to play this game because you have heard about it for such a long time but let me tell you that it isn't worth it. I bought this game because i thought it would be really cool but it is full of bad A.I., glitches, and very poor voice acting. The game play isn't much better and the plot isn't very well done, it feels like it was pushed to production. The A.I. is very stupid. They will stand right in front of you and they won't even know you are there. Plus there are tons of problems with the game. Objects, like guns, will hang in the air. I really wish i could give this game a good review but it really doesn't deserve it. So please don't buy this game."
3,Fun but gets boring,I rented this game cause I thought it's just reasonable to try it before I buy it. And I was right. This game was really interesting at first but I got bored two hours into play. It's repeatitive. I guess I'm not the shooting game type.Also it was weird how they didn't think of translating the Japanese dialogues into English. I speak Japanese so I understood what was going on but it just confused me cause this was supposed to be for North America release. Oh well I guess it doesn't really affect a gamer much but I thought I should just point that out anyway.
1,OMG!,"THIS GAME IS NO FUN AT ALL AND VERY HARD TO FOLLOW. I COULDN'T PLAY IT AT ALL. I BOUGHT THIS GAME HOPING FOR ACTION, BUT ITS SO HARD TO PLAY THAT I'VE GIVEN UP ON IT, PLUS THE WEAPONS ARE SO HARD TO GET AND THERE'S NO WHERE TO GO BUT IN CIRCLES. I HATE IT!"
3,Would be a good game.. on the gamecube..,"Red Steel has been hyped since its E3 demo many months ago.I'm sorry to say, that the game has not lived up to its hype.The graphics.. meh. Then again, this is the wii, and the controls must be good, right?Unfortunately, this is where red steel falls flat on its face. The controls have a bit of ""lag"" to them, that after having used the Wiimote for more than 5 minutes, gets UNBEARABLY FRUSTRATING. Forget about moving and shooting at the same time!I wanted this to be a good game.. but it just wasn't to be. Better luck next time, guys."
3,Shoot 'em up with a few twists courtesy of WII technology!,"Great game but could be even better.I really like the aspect of the otherwise typical search and destroy adventure game that allows you to point at the screen in the direction you wish to go or look/view. That's unique among games and controllers, courtesy of the unusual WII technology. But it could be even better if it allowed you to attack your enemies, grab items, move them and use them by using those same new abilities unique to WII. In other words, why not allow some form of hand-to-hand combat rather than just shooting the weapons? There may actually be a way to do that I haven't yet figured out, but I don't believe so.Overall an above average game, perhaps a three and a half star."
3,Under rated,This game should be rated M! The gangsters always cuse and extremly intense and violent. The sword fighting is really lame. The controls are really hard(unless your really good at the wii). So I say DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
4,New Innovation to a classic Genre,"This game is one of the top 3 games I bought for the Wii. It is a fun representation of what FPS will be like on the Wii. Though it has its glitches here and there, it is a fun new experience to use the Wii mote like a gun and a sword to defeat the Yakuza you face through out the game.With this, I am going to add that this is a great game to get into considering that a sequel is in the works and there have been talk of online play so, it is good to practice and master the training of the dojo.Overall, this is a game that can keep you occupied if you have multiple people for multiplayer and it can give you a one time only experience. Depending on your view and quility of the game, this is more fun then quality. It is early for the Wii launch so things will improve.with the power of Wii Connect24, who knows what else will be added?[...]"
4,It's a solid FPS,"I like this game, I have more control then in any other FPS I've played on a console. I think everyone just got so hyped about the sword fighting and were let down by it, but there really isn't that much of it in the game, and its more like a mini-game. I like the pacing of it, so far it plays really fast. The levels are about the right size and there is very little time spent between them. I like it, I think it has deserved better reviews as it was one of the first FPS's on the Wii."
2,New controls are the only thing this game is good for,"If this were your standard FPS it would get terrible reviews. The sword doesn't match how you swing the wiimote, it just swings a direction when you swing. There are only certain times when you can use the sword. The controls aren't perfect but they're decent."
2,Red Steel 2 is better.,Just get Red Steel 2 it is better in every signal way it's like night and day. I know alot of people don't want to give the second one a chance because the first one is so bad but it really is MUCH improved.
2,Great Ubisoft title. Oh wait that line is a lie.,Red Steel has sluggish controls when it comes to aiming. There is not a lot to be said about this game that other reviews have not already said. Graphics are of Gamecube quality. Sound is decent. When you use the sword it is not the most responsive. This game is a waste of money.
4,not as bad as they say.,this game is pretty good actually.sure the control is bad. but you get used to it eventuallyi cant really tell you about the story because i didnt really pay attention. i payed attention to it at first but it is VERY boring and VERY genericthe graphics arnt BAD but they are not GOOD either but graphics dont make a game right?the sword fights are NOT good they barely recognise your movement. you can win a fight by swinging around you can play while reading a BOOK when your fighting.The music is VERY GOOD i love the theme.so i think you should buy this game. its underrated
3,Not the best,"This game is ok. It is mildly difficult to control the character but after some time learning how to do it, it could be fun."
4,Red Steel - Overcomming the Controls sensitivity and Buggyiness,"My Son picked this up at GameStop used for $5.40, despite the unamious reviews about the games sensitivity with the Wii Controls. for the price he could not go wrong.I'll start off with getting the obvious out of the way...The Game Play is buggy. But, It is loads of fun and with exercising patience you will have fun trying to play it.The graphics are good, the choice of weapons are extensive and the story is entertaining. You will spend hours going from each level to the next.I would have given 5 stars had it not been for the bugginess and sensitivity of the controls, However with patience and control this can be worked through."
3,Still fun overall,"The controls are a bit annoying and it takes you a while to focus. But Red Steel was pretty fun and I kept playing unable to put it down. The swordfights were my favorite part and easier than the shooting. This is not a very difficult game, I think it's good for the casual gamer who doesn't play too many of these."
3,Fun Only One Time Through,"I bought this game a little while back even before I had a Wii. It seemed like the only shooter that was good for the Wii other than Call of Duty 3. The game itself was really fun the first time I played it. After awhile, though, it starts to slow down. The gun controls were very good, especially when using pistols and other small weapons. The sword fighting is another story. At first it is pretty fun, but you soon begin to dread this ""minigame"". They try to make it interesting with ""Respect Points"", but you can't even use these points to buy anything. In the end, this is a respectable game and will help people grasp the shooting controls of the Wii and have a little fun in between.P.S. I personally would suggest The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess or Call of Duty 3 over this game, but that's just me."
5,great shoes.,"I buy this brand and model often so I was already aware of thier quality and comfort, and this purchase was no exception. They have been a great pair of shoes at a great price."
5,Great shoe for great price,"Before I purchased this shoe I wore the Nike Pegasus and they too were good running shoes, but the GT-2110s are built better. The cushioning in the heel and the spacious toe box make them very comfortable. I'm 6'2 / 185 and generally run between 20 - 24 mpw."
4,running shoes,"everyone knows these are terrific shoes,couple that with great service and pricing and you can't beat it. extremely pleased with the whole amazon proceedure"
5,excellent shoe for the runner,"I've been wearing ASICS brand for years and they are by far the best shoe out there. I am a mild overpronator and the 2110 are the best shoe for me. I have been wearing this model shoe for about 3 years and always go back to the shoe for running. ASICS brand in particular is the best out there for running because that is what they specialize in. Overall, and excellent shoe worthly for the road and trail, wet or dry; the shoe is also very comfortable and light. I would strongly recommend this shoe for the novice runner or as a recreation shoe."
5,Great shoe. Great price.,"I have benn running off and on for 20 years. This particular asic is all the shoe you should ever need. It offers a great balance of comfort and support, Light wieght yet durable."
5,Great distance shoes,"These are great running shoes although I typically wear additional inserts for more cushion. I tend to pronate and these encourage me to run more towards the center of foot rather than on the outside. I have been buying the GT model each year for 7 years, almost tried the next two models higher in price, but these feel like the outside support is stronger.This particular purchase was great since I was buying the 2110s as last years model and saved about $30. Delivery from Foot Locker's Amazon store was right on time."
5,"Incredible music, incredible blues",Worthy tribute to women in the blues. Somehow Gaye captures that old time blues today. The piano artistry of Roddy Barnes is amazing. Together they have created something about the blues that is immediate yet classical. Selecting a favorite is virtually impossible. This CD should be at the top of the list.
3,great attempt at an excellent movie,"I rented this one from Red Box. The story could have easily been a great movie. As it turned out, it was an okay movie. The production was low level and made a negative difference. The actors probably would have looked a lot better if the director and producer had done a better job. The cutting and splicing was a little sloppy and the cuts that made it into the movie sometimes looked like they shouldn't have made it. No matter how low your budget, a good director can make a masterpiece. Here we have a movie that easily could have been a masterpiece but ended up being overshadowed by poor production decisions. The Rapture seen towards the end was the best Rapture seen ever. Too bad the rest of the movie didn't mimic that level of quality. Still, it is worth seeing."
5,Great message!,"This is a relevant, interesting movie with a great message! It has the ingredients of a good action thriller but with a deeper meaning that leaves you thinking long after the movie is finished. Anyone interested in end time events or that liked the Left Behind series will really enjoy this movie!"
2,Not what I thought it was,"I was disappoint. This is not what I thought it was. To me it was propaganda. Don't want to discourage anyone if you want to watch this, it just didn't do anything for me."
1,Jerusalem countdown,This movie went nowhere. It was totally amateur.The ending made no sense. Don't waist your time or money on this flick as it plays on a biblical theme to just get a pay check.
1,Jerusalem Countdown [Blu-ray],"There ought to be a law, (no too many of those already) but there should be some way to get your money refunded just for sitting through something as bad as this. My wife and I looked at each other and said, ""Are you kidding me? What was that?!"" To say that this movie went nowhere is to give it a complement. As Christians, we have come to know that it may just be OK. With recent releases (Courageous,Fireproof) and others, being quality films and this film getting all of those five star reviews from what had to be the films investors. I purchased it, don't you."
2,Very Poor scrip,"I was looking forward to this movie. I was very disappointed, poor acting, poor scrip. Mostly an attempt at a missionary movie but fell flat. The title was misleading."
1,"Lazy script, no suspense in this ""thriller"".","David A.R. White plays an FBI agent who finds out that nuclear weapons have been smuggled into the US by terrorists who want to attack the US and Israel. Inspired by a Christian non-fiction book about Bible prophecy, ""Jerusalem Countdown"" is heavy on religion and often feels preachy, while it fails miserably when it comes to plotting and creating suspense. The result is a boring movie that doesn't even measure up to other faith based thrillers. Not recommended."
3,Jerusalem Countdown,Movie was very suspenseful. Did not care for the cliffhanger ending! Kind of left me in the dark. Trailer doesnt do justice for the whole film.
4,Glad I bought it!,"It is a very well made movie that I think many people should watch. In this day and age of what I call ""insanity"" and definitely immorality, all people should try to find the TRUTH."
3,High Quality but Confusing Story,"This movie is a step up for Christian action movies--it has a high quality production value and the acting is excellent--and there are explosions, etc. It also has a message for Christ.My problem is that it seems to be striving to follow in the same vein of the Bourne movies (but not as good)--fast-paced, no-explanations plot mixed with a kinectic pace of action...leaving the viewer wondering what the heck just happened and why.But I still liked it and will probably see it again."
5,Great movie,We really enjoyed watching this movie. I would recommend it those who enjoy watching Christian films.This ia an action movie.
4,Jerusalem Countdown,This was a pretty good rendition of the end times. Seemed to be sound scripturally. And the acting was pretty good for a faith-based film company. I will watch it again.
4,Good Family Show,Anyone who enjoys a good suspensefilled and clean of vulgar profanities or sexual inuendo movie. Enough said about this product.
4,Good Movie,"This is an excellent prelude to the Left Behind series. Obviously, they are not made by the same people but I believe it is a good lead in and the producers should consider a coombined package."
4,Countdown,"The general idea of this film was very interesting and I thought David White did his best acting in it. It would not be easy for a family audience to see some of scenes which give it a 12a rating. These include the fighting, agression etc. But the movie was great."
1,not so great,"I have had one for about 2 months and cons are starting to outwiegh the pros. The viewfinder came with plastic shavings inside of it, after pressing the shutter, it takes seconds to take the photo, almost all motion is blured and it changes red to a pinkish color sometimes. the camara is akward to hold, the lcd screen displays 3 different seprate images when the camara is moving. There are more cons and a few pros, but Im running out of space"
5,Classy,"Great watch. It has a very low profile so it sits close to your wrist. I get lots of compliments on it. The color is a little more rose than I thought, but it looks great!"
3,"good watch, different color than expected","got it for my sister for Christmas. it looked more gold in the picture. she decided to return it. nice look, though."
4,Great little watch,Very simple and elegant which is why I bought this watch for my wife. She is very happy with it. I think Skagen watches are a great value and are well made. I have several different models all of which have lasted years and still look good.
1,Never received correct watch,"First got a modem, not a watch; then got a silver round faced watch; then got another silver round faced watch. After 3 tries I gave up."
3,"Skagen watches are not ""100% stainless steel)","""All Skagen stainless steel watch cases and bands are constructed from durable 100 percent solid stainless steel, and is nickel safe and hypoallergenic for sensitive skin.""This information is incorrect. I spoke to a Skagen customer service representative (1-877-SKAGEN1) this morning regarding the properties of their Stainless Steel watches. (My sister is allergic to Nickel and I was hoping to buy her a Skagen watch for Christmas). The representative checked with her manager and NONE of their stainless steel watches are 100% nickel-free. She did indicate that an allergic reaction would be unlikely, unless the person has a severe nickel allergy.Regardless, Skagen makes fabulous watches. Just be aware that just because they are Stainless Steel does not mean they are nickel-free!"
5,Excellent Value for Money,"This is the first Skagen watch I've purchased and am very pleased with the look of the watch, love the MOP face. It has a delicateness to it that goes well with my small wrist. I found the band adjustment easy without even reading the instructions. I have the silver version on my wish list waiting for a sale.. lol Will update in a couple months after some use."
5,Levon. A True American Treasure,Here you get an inside look at the legendary drummer and singer of The Band. Later he would host his Midnight Rambles from his home in Woodstock. He was a dear friend of 40 years and the best drummer around. He's passed on now; but if you want insight into his playing and legacy. This is the DVD to buy. Worth every penny.
3,Cannot be used with handsfree!,"It seems that the case wasn't thought to be used with handsfree. There is no way you can connect correctly the charger or the handsfree to the phone when it is ""wearing"" the case.Finally, some plastic parts weren't cut correctly and you can see perfectly how they try to correct the wistake.I give it three starts because the design is the best you can find on the market."
1,A USED CD!,"I was sent a used CD when I ordered a new one. The case was broke! No securtiy sticker, no cellophane wrapper. Cheap. Amazon should check the purchasing history of their customers before they send them junk. I sent it back."
3,Och it's okay.,Not incredibly fun but not boring either. It's a pretty easy game but the campaigns are a wee bit tricky.
3,Scratches really easy,It looks awesome out of the box. Just like the picture. But within a couple of days I could start to see that it was getting scratched even when I was being consciously extra careful. After that I figured it wasn't going to make much of a difference whether I was careful or not. That made life lots easier.
5,THIS BAND IS FULL OF CEREAL KILLERS,"i seen them 4 times each had more blood and more chaos then i have ever seen the best show and band i ever heard in my life. if you dont like violence and pure CUT throats then dont buy it i love bands like hatebreed,mushroomhead,kittie,skinlab,(216),13faces all under ground well buy this and keep the under ground going in philidelphia **--"
2,not worth the money,"Purchased (2) of these impact drivers for metal roofing and siding, metal studs and some drywall on projects in Alaska. Both impact guns needed replacement (gearing stripped in one, nosepiece cracked on other exposing gears) within first three weeks, one replacement lasted only one month (gears whined like original and then quit). I also had a 12V Makita that still runs great (didnt even have the new NiMH batteries) after(3) of the (4) Milwaukees broke down in IDENTICAL applications. Makita now makes a 14.4V (NiMH) impact driver which is the one I would suggest hands down."
1,A Fantasy about Jason Connery,"I wanted to like this novel: I really did! Unfortunately, I am a big fan of the Robin Hood legend and the British TV series it inspired. I became angry as I noticed the amount of overlap between this book and the series: Much, the halfwit; Little John, the humble shepard; Will Scarlet, the hothead with a vendetta against Norman soldiers. The only character that didn't match the TV show was Marion whose description matchs that of the author. Coincidence? I don't think so. Especially since the entire plot involves changing comely young Robin's orientation... and I'm not talking about compass direction."
2,Started but not finished....,"It turns out I should have heeded the reviews that said this is a romance in a historical setting rather than the ones that stated this is really good historical fiction. There IS a big difference. I began this book and went through about 40 pages before I had to put it down in disappointment. There is nothing special about the writing here, and the sexual references are so many that it seems the writer needs these to carry the story or make it compelling. This never works for me! I want something substantive, and this is not it. Perhaps I gave up too soon and will try again another time, but for now I'm going to take the suggestion of one of the reviewers and dive into The Black Chalice by Marie Jakober -- it looks most compelling. I understand that it, too, has some good, steamy scenes, but ones that are beautifully subtle and thought-provoking rather than ones splashed across the pages. Many thanks to the reviewer who recommended!"
5,Easily the best book I have ever read,"I have read and re-read this book an innumerable amount of times, and each time I read it, my appreciation grows for Jennifer Roberson. I love the story line, and I particulary enjoy the boldness of Marian in this retelling. Being a (somewhat reluctant) 13 year old, I also like the fantasy that the story itself provokes."
5,A fabulous book,"_Lady of the Forest_ is a lovely retelling of the Robin Hood legend, mostly from Marian FitzWalter's point of view. I don't normally enjoy the endless retellings of the Arthurian and Robin Hood legends, but I will definitely make an exception for this book. Robin is haunted and wounded from his service in the Crusades, and Marian is a very believable and likeable heroine. The love story is beautiful, the supporting characters are wonderful, and I didn't want this book to end."
5,"A new, more mesmerizing, tale of Robin Hood and Maid Marion!","So many authors portray the tale of Robin Hood as flat and one dimensional; the conflict is simple: good versus evil. Yet, the conflict in this tale is anything but simple, difficult choices are made - should Richard, a captive, be foresaken for John, a contender for the throne? Robertson shows the characters as human - they make choices and mistakes, just as we all do. For instance, the Lionheart is often portrayed as infallible, while the opposite is true. Robertson also gives a great deal of time to explaining the conflicts of others as well - especially Lady Marion. Marion is developped as a strong female character, yet she still correctly represents the females of her day. This book is the ultimate tale of Robin Hood - it truly brings the one dimensional mish-mash of tales handed down over the centuries to life"
4,An enjoyable telling of the tale...,"The reason I didn't rate the book five stars was due to the quick wrap-up ending which left me rather unsatisfied overall. The writing was very pleasing to read, the characters very interesting. Although Robin's relationship with Richard was unclear throughout the lengthy book, it could have been flushed out a bit better. I enjoyed the book. I'll look for the sequel as well. Ms. Roberson's writing is very pretty and kept me turning the pages like a thriller."
4,Fully rigged and bound for the Shetlands,"Excellent music -- ranging from mysterious to exciting, and entertaining every step of the way. The title led me to expect sea chanteys, which is not quite the case. Performed very simply and directly(the way I like it). The fiddle and mandorla are a good combination; the wind instruments are understated and very effective. If you're a collector of ""Celtic"" music, and expecting Scottish style, you may be surprised by the strong Norse flavor. I'm keeping one for myself, and sending another to my daughter in Edinburgh."
5,fuly rigged ... wonderful,"i first heard cuts from fully rigged on npr and knew i had to try and track it down. i was so pleased with earthy, evocative quality of the music, i purchased a second cd for my son and daughter in law. i'm now looking into buying other cd's."
4,Skagen Titanium,Service was outstanding. I had a problem with the band and got a replacement immediately. I like the watch display and profile. My only complaint is that the shape of the watch catches on my jackets and backpacks.
4,Good Watch-Bad Scratch,"I got this watch for my boyfriend for our anniversary. It is a very nice, light-weight watch. The only issue my boyfriend and I had was the fact that it was sent with a huge scratch in the clasp. We kept it only because we figured it would get scratched at some point down the road."
2,Watch,"The watch while nice looking is much too laqrge for the average wrist, if it were smaller it would be an ideal addition to one's jewelry collection"
4,wonderful family movie,"I am just beginning to explore the Czech movie genre through my Czech born wife and if this movie is any indication of the caliber they produce I am in for a treat, this movie is funny and emotional...everything you go see an American movie for!"
3,"sorry to rain on the parade, but...","I must admit: this film is cute and it does have some nice funny scenes. But take it easy, it is not a great film. I found it to be alternately engaging and then distancing. I also found myself waiting for it to end already; also not a good sign. There are some good ancillary performances from the other actors, but on the whole I found this to be surprisingly shallow."
4,will stay with you long after it's over,I really liked this movie. It's not exactly what I expected -- the video cover makes it seem like a thriller -- but it's different and funny in its own way. I thought the acting was good and the story fun. Days after I watched it I was still thinking about it and some of the images too. In the end it was sweet and romantic but real.
5,A super session!,"John Patitucci shines with refulgent brightness in this album that would seem to be inspired in retrospective mood. The memories of John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman or Charles Mingus are suggested and underlined. Since his fabulous rapport with Chick Corea, his progresses and goals have experimented an exponential increase.In this sense this CD is a febrile renovation, a smart reinvention of idiomatic scents of classic Jazz, expressed with freshness and sumptuous musicality.Excellent and distinction are the essential features thatcharacterize this album."
1,"Non, non, non","if youjust want to learn how to converse, do not buy this book. they discuss colloquial french. contact me, ill ship you mine."
4,Very reliable,"I was pleased that the book was exactly as described: used, but in very good condition--with no writing in it at all--which was paramount for me, since it's a book of (written) exercises and contains no answer key. I also appreciated the very fast standard shipping--apparently much faster than that of many who just ordered the book new from Amazon. My only (minor) complaint about the packaging was that the seller used staples rather than packing tape to seal the envelope--not a good choice, as it's difficult not to get punctured while opening, if you're not extra careful--which I wasn't!"
4,PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE,"All types of materials are important for variation in learning a language.This book compiles exercises that are seemingly easy but watch out! You need an additional book that has the answers that my friend bought. I study with 2 other friends. We do the exercises on our own, then get together to read them and correct them. I would recommend this book in conjunction with conversation, writing and reading additional material in french."
5,Merveilleux,This workbook contains excellent exercises and explanations of French grammar. It is a great addition to any textbook. Excellent series.
3,A bare bones grammar,"Although this is a good basic grammar, I would have liked it more with additional examples. It is also a rip-off that you have to purchase an additional book for exercises with an answer key. Why not just sell a bigger book?"
4,Eiht Hype,"Sure he may not be the best lyricist in the game, but thats not what Eiht is about. If you miss that real gritty gangsta rap this is where its at. Even if you lean toward more of the party/pop hip hop, they is that on here too. Bottom line, this album is better than just good, Its mind blowing. This is my favorite Eiht solo of the past 10 years."
2,"Eiht's newest is not exactly a ""banger""!","I know a lot of people like to just come in here and drop ""five star"" reviews for artists that they like. The only problem with this is it actualy hurts that artist when some new fan goes out and buys one of their weaker albums.This is the case with ""Underground Hero"". Aside from a few humorous skits and a track with The Outlawz that is actually pretty good, this album is very mediocre. Most of the tracks aren't very catchy and even a collaboration with one of my favorite emcees, Sticky Fingaz is not very noteworthy.Do yourself a favor and go out and get ""We Come Strapped"" because that is where M.C. Eiht shined. This is just an average album. Hopefully, Eiht does better on his next one because he is a very talented rapper and his fans deserve better."
1,Very UNCOOL home movies,"A very misleading video about Bob Dylan's world tour of 1966. This is all about the drummer Mickey Jones who had an interesting music and movie career and brought his 8mm camera along on the concert tour with Dylan. THIS IS ALL ABOUT MICKEY JONES. I wish I had read the reviews before I paid 19.95 for this. Although some insights are given into the lifestyle of touring musicians, there is very little to add about the '66 tour that you wouldn't already know. The glimpses of Dylan walking away from the camera or peering out from the back seat of a limo are not much different than some footage I have of friends on a day trip to Disneyworld-would you pay 20 bucks for that? I don't think so. and the co-producer is a Bob Dylan tribute artist who makes an appearance near the end as Bob Dylan...a bit of shameless self promotion."
3,Too self serving,I've known Mickey Jones since the 70s but only as a character actor on TV shows. I had no idea of his connection to Dylan and the Band. He starts off the video stating that he was the original drummer for this tour which is deceptive. Levon Helm of course was the original and Jones replaced him after he left. Anyway there is good video so it is worth watching.
1,Misleading,"Lessons learned: Read the reviews. The low end reviews are pretty accurate in their descriptions: ""This is a movie about Mickey, not Bob"".Perhaps I am unfairly comparing his stuff to the Scorsese or Pennebaker documentaries, which is a pretty high standard.The bottom line is that this is really very boring for anyone, but fanatics..."
1,Gave it one star since ratings didn't allow no stars,Complete rip off. Like buying a bag of oregano. Dylan appears only briefly and entire video was filmed without any sound. Mickey Jones narrates the whole thing and more than half is just him sitting in his studio being interviewed. Jones is disgusting to look at and so is this video.
2,World Tour 1966 The Home Movies,"My husband, I and our high school grandson (who is a musician and Dylan fan) were excited to view this video. We were so disappointed we didn't even finish it. The content was interesting but the title, and especially Dylan's photo on the cover is so deceptive. Although the movies are ""neat"" I think Mickey Jones capitalized on the name Bob Dylan. I think anyone would expect that concert clips would be a video with Dylan's picture on the cover---NOT! Don't spend your money on this DVD. I wish I could return it."
4,A well written technical guide,"I purchased this book for a class on PC Maintenance. It is a well written, articlulate book and assumes NO prior knowledge on the part of the reader regarding PC hardware. It covers both the older and newer (ex SATA) technologies. The CD's are OK, but they are encoded in Quick Time format as opposed to DVD."
1,WOULD LUV TO OWN ONE...BUT TOO EXPENSIVE FOR A SINGLE,"I am one of Face long time supporter, but I have to say this single is too expensive. I gave it 1 star rating, because I have as yet to listen to it. I would luv to have it in my collection but hey...its price is unreasonable. I bet that the single is good and I will buy it when the price drops."
5,Can't Go To Wrong With Genuine Products,"I have a friend who had an Epson printer and went with the cheap substitution ink. After that, his printouts were sub-par at best. So I just use the ""genuine"" Epson ink cartridges and haven't had a problem. There may be some knock-off brands that are fine but at present, I'm not confident in them."
4,Wouldn't use anything else,You pretty much have to use the printer manufacturer's ink these days to get consistent and correct results. Only reason for the 4 stars is due to Epson's inaccurate ink levels that force you to change out before you are in any real danger of running out.
1,Ski and Snowboard Film? Hardly!,"If you like skiing, you might want to check this out.If you like snowboarding (the cover of the DVD does say Ski and Snowboarding Film), don't waste your time and money!Total time of snowboarding in this DVD is less then 4 minutes.Misleading cover, Misleading discription. Utter waste."
3,A Tale of Some Good and Mostly Old Hat,"I think this book was informative, but most of the material is old hat. However, Appendix B was one redeeming factor (""User Interface Checklist"")."
1,snoooozzz,"I bought this book for a class in introduction to website development. I honestly have to say I couldnt get past the first three chapters, so that is what I will comment on. I had to read this at Starbucks so I was close to a source of caffiene. Everything I read had to do with understanding the project of building a website or taking over an existing one...the book really needs to be retitled something along the lines of...How to determine whether or not your staff is worth keeping. Complete waste of time and money...Just glad I got it at price club for 22.95."
1,A complete waste of time and money.,"I am not sure what the author was thinking (or even better what the publisher was thinking) when they wrote this ""book."" A basic rehash of the basics with no real value adds.I didn't get even one unique insight by reading this book. The author uses a borish writing style and has very little applied experience/wisdom to share.Save your time and money and go elsewhere!"
4,Great Guitar,I love this guitar. It has great sound and is the perfect size for a girl. The paint job is a little fragile but other than that no complaints. It's also really cool looking!!
1,THIS IS THE MOST WACKEST CD IVE EVER HEARD,"FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES THIS CD THEY ARE NOT A TRUE WU FAN CAUSE THIS CD IS GARBAGE. MOST OF THE MUSIC IS TAKEN OUT OF THE RETURN TO THE 36 CHAMBERS AND PUT OVER NEW BEAT WACK BEATS AT THAT, WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY PUT ICP,CMURDER,MACK10 ON THIS ALBUM. THIS IS JUST A WAY THE GREEDY INDUSTRY D3 RECORDZ WANTED TO MAKE MONEY OFF THIS MAN. WHEN THIS CD WAS COMING OUT ODB WAS IN JAIL AND HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS COMING OUT. I GAVE THIS CD 1 STAR BECAUSE IT ONLY HAD ONE GOOD ORIGINAL SONG ON THERE AND THAT WAS LINTBALLZ WITH BROOKLYN ZOO AND SUNZ OF MAN,TO ANY TRUE WU FAN OUT THERE I ADVISE YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD."
1,this makes wu tang look bad,his voice is annoying and he cant rap. i wasted my money on this cd. he should be kicked out of the wu tang clan and he should stop rapping because he has no talent
1,"If You Love ODB, Don't Buy This Album!","This album is a sheisty industry money making move! ODB had nothing to do with the production of this album! Russel Jones didn't even know that it was coming out! All it is is old ODB verses put over wack new beats with guest MCees. This album is horrid, and if you love and respect ODB like myself, don't pick it up. Go get Nigga Please and Return to the 36, those are albums that ODB actually had input on. This album sucks. ODB doesn't suck though. Damn the sheisty jerks at D3 records. They are doing their best to destroy ODB's reputation as a great MC, which he most definitely is."
1,My first listen was my last...,"First song has the worst group ever, ICP, that automatically makes this CD horrible from the beginning. The majority of ODB's lyrics are just cut out of old Wu-Tang songs. The production is horrible. Stay away from this CD, I don't even consider it a Wu CD."
1,not even a wu cd,"odb has about two songs on this cd. the rest is some e-40, i.c.p. ... . the only song that even makes it worthy of 1 star is ""c'mon"". i'm not some beat junkie ja rule fan either i got every wu cd from shyheim to sunzof man. this is the only wu-cd stayin out of my collection."
2,Such a disappointment,"Ol Dirty. That used to be enough to make many Wu Tang fans run to the local record store and buy his records unheard. The trials and tribulations of Russel Jones is so dissapointing I can't express it in words. Cousin RZA aka Robert Diggs aka Bobby Digital didn't have any input into this cd and if he did I would hope that Insane Clown Posse wouldn't be on it. The album falls flat on it's face from the very beginning. Two tracks with Sunz of Man and Brooklyn Zu are standout tracks on this album, but unfortunately a 20 dollar single is plain stupid. ..."
5,"Don't Let the ""Live"" Part Discourage Anyone","I usually don't pay attention to live albums, but this one is better than most I have ever listened to. Lif does a nice job here, and definitely sounds different live than he does on his albums. There are places where singing is absent and Lif tries to bring the audience into his world, and extended periods where there are little ""skits"" of sorts. However despite this, the album flows well, and these interludes make the singing even more memorable. The album overall is well put together, from the 2nd song/sketch Get This Paper, to the intesting mix of the rockwilder song on Inhuman Capabilites. With a few unreleased songs and material and even tight 13 min freestyle near the end. I recommend this to any Mr. Lif fan"
2,Pass this one by unless you're a die-hard fan,"It is difficult to summarize this movie without explaining the entire plot in one or two sentences. There is a small twist at the end that differentiates it from others, but this is so minor and comes so late it is difficult to accept or care. Essentially, we are treated to an opening that introduces us to Susan Heller (played by Andrea Roth, who despite being in movies such as this has quiet a following online) who stumbles into the lives of a ranching family when his car ""breaks down"". She manages to win the trust of the husband (played by Gil Gerard - yes, Buck Rogers himself - who shows us all just how low you can sink) and gets a job. However, the sister does not believe her (as the formula dictates) from the very beginning, and sets out to discover the truth behind Susan."
3,;0/,"It's ok-ish story is typically about a woman given up for adoption at birth she wants payback for how she grew up, thus her finding her real mother and killing people along tne way. With a few tweaks here and the it surely could have been better."
1,misleading advertising,"No ""miniscore"" was provided with the CD as advertised, apart from 1 page of the score.This is not the entire score for which I believed I was paying. This is an example of misleading advertising.The same criticism applies to CDs I purchased by Hamel and Otte."
3,"Not one of the best singles I've heard, but it's alright","I saw this single at Cheapo Discs and bought it thinking 'Ok, 'Star Guitar'...I love the song...let's see what the single has to offer'. Peter Heller did not really impress me much at all. The 'Expanded Mix' was way too repetitive and the '606 Dub' didn't but it for me either. The EDIT was nothing new, it was only like the EDIT of 'South Side' by Moby --> just a shorter cut *shrug*. I don't know what else to say but, if you see this single anywhere, buy it if you really thingk you'll like it."
3,Too Much Dubbing For Me,"Tracks 3 and 4 are the weakest from the entire single. Especially, ""Star Guitar-(Peter Heller 303 dub)"" (yes, very cartoonish...not a bad thing...it's just...) the constant dubbing get into ones nerve till their head explode into pieces. And for ""Base 6"" (a few add on) you'll recognize some beats that have been used before in the past. But I guess for the beat lovers, it can't go wrong."
5,"Very funny, typically Westlake","This was a very funny book. It had the usual Westlake shenanigans and completely outlandish behavior, but the twist is how the newspaper in the story is modeled after The National Inquirer. It made good fun of the ""excessive news"" industry and added a new concept: the body in the box. This is the holy grail of excessive news stories in this book. The protagonists try to take a picture of a dead famous person in his coffin. Absolutely hilarious! The female protagonist is naive and personable, very believable. The male lead is also believable as a cad who just wants stories that sell. I highly recommend this one to fans of Lawrence Block, Elmore Leonard, and Janet Evanovich (as well as Westlake fans)."
2,"Pretty Lame, not a stand alone toy","This is a simple toy, glasses with a couple things you can pop on to make it funny. The lenses are not clear so it's a little hard to see through. I guess if you had the other giggle gear products to go along with this it might be fun but this is NOT a stand alone toy. On top of that the included batteries were dead so I had to drop 5 more bucks into those and then all it does is blink a little."
3,What are they smoking ???,This Alblum is Ok but doesn't even come Close to Man of Colours alblum There are a few good tracks like Don't Believe Anymore : This Time : and Taking the Town. If your a diehard ICEHOUSE Fan enjoy.
3,Tangy Guacamole,"This is another of Aaron Jackson's movies. Google ""Aaron Jackson"" to see his complete list. It is ""Spring Break"" venue."
2,Only for the true planet smashers fan,"This by far the worst album by the planet smashers. The only good songs on here are change and my decision. If you aren't a huge planet smashers fan don't get this album. If you want a planet smashers album but aren't a completly dedicated fan then get life of the party, no self control, or mighty. I think their first album falls into this category even though it surpasses this album by far."
4,Good but could be better,"The leatherface match is basically cut in half, which means it is a little boring. The Terry Funk + Mr. Pogo vs. Hayabasa + Masato Tanaka match is sick. Mr. Pogo pulls out a knife and stabs Tanaka in the back. There is a sick bump when Terry Funk and Hayabasa fall on some broken glass and nails, both are cut up really bad. The ring explodes and they all are hurt really bad. The womens match: Megumi Kudo vs. Combat ""Mother in Law"" Toyoda is a good match. Both give it their all, and it is Toyoda last wrestling match. The Cactus Jack match against Kanemura is a sick match also. Both take sick bumps on the broken glass and nails, and also the barbwire. The announcers crack me up for most of the video, then they start calling each other gay and stuff like that. Overall this video gets a four star rating. It would have five if the Leatherface/Mike Awesome match was in full."
4,Get it for Kudo vs. Toyota,"Out of the first four US commercial releases FMW has made, this tape is by far the best. The last two matches (i'm not counting the bonus matches here) are highly dramatic, especially Kudo vs. Toyota, which is easily the best match of the tape. The story, selling, and build to the spots in Kudo vs. Toyota are all excellent. Cactus vs. Kanemura, and the tag main event are both very good too (although there are some serious flaws in the tag match). The first three matches on the tape aren't good, and as always for these FMW tapes, neither is the English commentary. I recommend that anyone who interested in picking up one of the FMW US commercial releases should pick this one up first."
2,Bitterly Disappointing,"I'm from the Uk and i'm an avid ECW fan, and with all the FMV stars such as Tanaka, Awesome, Team No respect etc etc that made the crossover to the states, i thought why not get hold of some FMV footage. No i cannot say that all FMV stuff is this bad because this is the only stuff i've seen, but this DVD is terrible. The cover trys to use the Cactus Jack match with Kanemura as its main selling point, and this in its self is a terrible match. I must admit though i was Pleasantly surprised with the Women's Electrifed barbwire match, this for me was the highlight of the DVD and a exceptional match between ""the mother in law"" and Megumi Kudo. Besides that the DVD doesn't hold many other selling points and even the main match up at the end between Terry Funk-Mr.Pogo vs Hayabusa and Tanaka was very poor. I'm sure there are better FMV DVD's than this, so stay clear."
4,Good taste of hardcore Japanese matches...,"One of the easiest ways in the US to get a taste of hardcore ""garbage"" Japanese wrestling. Not for the faint hearted - the best matches are the bloodiest. Painful matches include: a ""Double Hell Barbed Wire Glass Crush Spider Net"" deathmatchwith Cactus Jack vs. Kanemura, a ""No Rope Exploding Double Hell Timebomb"" deathmatch with Mr. Pogo, Terry Funk, Tanaka, and Hayabusa, and even a no-rope exploding barbed wire female wrestling match!As with the other FMW tapes, the announcers try to imitate Insane Clown Posse's funny wrestling tapes, and fail pretty miserably at it. The DVD is recommended since you can turn the announcers off, and you get one pretty good bonus match to boot.Note this is NOT the IWA ""King of the Deathmatch"" tournament that made Cactus Jack and Terry Funk famous."
4,The true originators of hardcore,"When I got this home I was a little disappointed to find that the disc is made up of 8 matches from the 5-5-96 show and tokyopop made no indication that it wasnt actually a tourney. Strange title considering IWA had the deathmatch tourney! Aside from that the matches are excellent and if you can withstand the dull and useless commentators you will find some highly entartaining and hardcore matches.Highlights include Mick Foley as you've never seen him before in a brutal double hell barbed wire glass crush spider net death match and another highlight is two women having one helluva wrestling contest in a ring surrounded by electricifed barbed-wire!A must for anyone who hasnt seen anything like this before and who wants to see how seriously the Japanese treat it as a sport instead of entertainment.Oh yeah, its region free as well so it will work on ALL dvd players!"
3,Not the best Nring psychology but down right great brutality,"This wasnt the best FMW DVD that they have to offer.When it comes to death matches this pretty much serves its purpose, on exception of the very first match. The rest were bloody and brutal in true death match fashion.I have to say that the Combat ""Mother in Law"" Toyoda vs. Megumi Kudo match is on my personal top 10. You dont look at them as just some female competitors tryin to wrestle like the big dogs. All you see are two intense wrestlers giving their all and producing a quality death match.Overall a good piece to add to a wrestling fans collection."
2,Amitri and Mary Chain,"The lyrics are too thought through, the singing is forced and the musicianship isn't exactly shining through. I wouldn't call this their first album, but more of a prologue to an amazing story which is the Del Amitri back catalogue. You can hate all other Del and love this album, alternatively you love Del and are intrigued by this rather odd piece of musical development in prgress. Just don't expect too much. Certainly worth a listen, but not great."
1,did not work,"This item did not work when I received it in the mail, it was difficult to operate and the instructions were pretty vague. I returned it and was out the shipping cost for the delivery and the return, so I should have bought it in a store and saved a bit."
3,A quiet and affecting work,"This album will not overpower you, but slowly work it's way into your mind. Quietly powerful and moving, Hawley's music seems out of time-not particular to any era. This is not to say that it is bland, but refreshing timeless. His voice has a haunting clarity evoking world weariness reminscent of Nick Drake. Highlights include ""The Long Black Train"", and ""Have you seen the Rain, my love?"" As I mentioned in the beginning, neither of these tracks will make a deep impression on you the first time you listen to them, but linger on in your head and you will find yourself coming back to the tracks time and time again."
5,Access the Zone helped me find the Zone,"I've found my ""Jewel in the Desert"" as far as mental golf instruction. I've played professional golf on the mini-tours for 3 years. I knew there was something missing from my game. I would play ""timid and restricted"" in tournaments, but would play great with my friends at home. After listening to the tapes, and working with Mike Allen I've been able to play ""loose and fearless"" by ""Accessing the Zone"" whenever I want!! Thank you for making these tapes."
3,Otimo,"~~~~~~~My first exposure to Trio Mocoto was a live show in Sao Paulo, and I, like the rest of the audience, was sweating from uncontrollable dancing after the second song. Their manic energy, tight rhythms, and great stage presence all made for a great show. I purchased this disc shortly thereafter and am quite happy with it. I love ""Tudo Bem""; this cut alone justifies the purchase. As other reviewers have aptly pointed out, the tracks on this album are generally upbeat and fun, and there is~~ a high level of musicianship as well. Those Brazilians have it down. However, I would stop short of awarding this disc five stars on the basis of the lyrics. Lyrically, this group simply isn't up to par with other popular Brazilian musicians like Lenine and Gilberto Gil, who I consider to be excellent technical musicians as well as gifted writers. Buy this disc by all means: you will enjoy it. But don't expect it to move your mind, just your bunda.~~~~~~~"
5,This record rocks,Were these guys a big influence on Seu Jorge or what?. This record is great. I love the the use of the cuica on the melody for Aguas de Marco. Need to go re-visit their 2003 cd.
4,"More Samba than Rock,but still amazing!","I just think this is the best record i had last year(2004)Its funky,happy and the band plays really tight.Just buy it no matter what kind of music u r listening to.Pensado nela is one of the most mellow tunes i ever heard and volteu amor the opening track is full of energy."
4,Enjoyable!,"After purchasing ""Samba Soul 70!"" one year ago, my interest in Brazilian music was sparked. This new album by Trio Mocotó is a welcome addition to my collection. My favorites so far are the laid-back ""Pensando Nela"" and the remake of the Moraes/Toquinho song ""A Tonga da Mironga do Kabulet"" (a Brazilian friend of mine sent me the original as I could not find it in the US). I am a beginner at Portuguese, but this album is well worth every penny."
5,Something for Everyone,"With Daniela's strong vocal talent and varied musical styles represented on this album, there really is a song for everyone's musical tastes. (And the words are included with the album, so I can sing along.) She's going to be a *star*! My favorite cut is Track #12 - There Goes the Girl."
5,Good tactical shooter,This game arrived in good time and in good condition from the seller. It follows in the tradition of Tom Clancy styled games in the sense that it involves lots of strategy and realism. Particularly interesting is the cover mode which allows the character to seek cover behind practically any object in the environment. A worthy addition to the Tom Clancy library.
5,Fun game!,"I tell you this game is one of my all-time favorits.Its fun mission, FPS and multiplayer made it a blast!If you like shootem games and guns ect you will love it!"
3,Ok,It was fun. I love tactical games. At the time this was first out it would have been amazingBut today it is seriously lacking. Still was fun but had the worst achievements ever. Oh well it was worth the price being so cheap.
5,Vegas,"this game is so SIKK!! I love it. brings back so many memories of when I used to be a little kid. This game is awesome and it has the perfect balance of gore and tactic action, I definitely recommend it"
4,Get ready to die....a lot.,"Very difficult game. And I mean VERY difficult. Personally I have no issues beating games like BioShock or Call of Duty series type games while dying minimal times. So far I am two acts through Rainbow Six Vegas and I imagine that I have died at least 50 times. Whether it's due to my partners dying or myself, I die a ton of times.The cover mechanism of this game is superb. The graphics are superb as well. The weapons are incredibly realistic, and what you will find is that since they are so realistic, the aiming is much harder than other games.I found this game to be very frustrating. I love the story, controls are good, it just seems like guys randomly pop out a lot and you die a ton. Other than that, a very solid game and one that will take you a long time to beat!"
3,I hate having weapons dissallowed online because I don't waste all of my time playing it,"Game play is fun, I enjoyed the regular game and I enjoy playing online. But I LOATHE games that make me spend 50 hours playing them before I can use all the weapons. It doesn't incentivise people to play more, it ticks them off. The uniforms and stuff you earn are incredibly lame too."
2,Compared to 'Splinter Cell Double Agent' This is AWEFULL,"As far as this Vegas & Ghost Recon, these 2 games are Not Even Fun after playing Splinter Cell Double Agent. I bought that first and then got Vega & Ghost Recon. The later two have NO story line compared, the graphics suck compared, and the game play sucks compared. Splinter Cell is a masterpiece in Gaming. Because you dont go around with a big gun or grenade in your hand the entire time. You actually play a role and use your'e body. Very disapointed with the Earlier games. It'll be fun when the next Splinter Cell games come out, they are in their own Genera. Period."
1,Why Did I Buy This?!!??!,Do not buy this game if you've played Call of Duty 4!! The graphics & game play blow compared. You will not like it.
5,Amazing,"At first I was reluctant to buy this game because I was saving money for the Halo 3 legendary edition but then I played it online at my friends house and its amazing. One of my favorite thing is the ranking system along with the Ability to customize your armour. Whether you want to be wearing recon armour or an all out assault vest is up to you. I am A halo fan at heart but ive always loved the Tom clancy series. Played the first ghost recon on PC and so on. Definately a good buy I have been playing for only a month now and I still havent played every single map theres nearly 20 of them. And ill be playing untill September 25th, 2007(Day halo 3 comes out for all you people that dont know)"
5,Great game,This is one of the most realistic games i have played for the xbox. The online line play is great and there will be 6 new maps coming soon. i would recommend this game to anyone that likes to play first person shooters. BETTER THEN G.R.A.W. 2
4,A lot more fun than I expected,I thought that a video game 1st person shooter based in Las Vegas was going to be over the top campy and silly. But I was pleasantly suprised to see that everything worked well and the game was very fun to play.I recommend this game. Last I looked I saw it was selling used for around $[...]. A very good purchase for less than $[...].
4,"Great, but the AI absolutely sucks","Like the reviews above, Vegas is a great, well-rounded game. The only problem I have is the AI for your teammates. Its truly horrible. I can't tell you how many times I've been slaughtered due to the idiocy of the AI. They get in the way, don't do anything unless you tell them exactly what to do, and are just completely stupid. It really makes the game less enjoyable after a few hours of playing."
4,Awesome,"I'll keep it simple this was just a fun game to play, only thing keeping it from a 5-star is the A.I. sometimes your guys get in the way, but that's to be expected from the year it was launched. Co-Op was cool & it has moderate replay value."
5,Addictive,"Use the left trigger for cover on anything,fully custimze handguns,rifles,sub-machine,assault rifle easily!night vision,heat goggles(thermal)command 2 soldiers easily,very easy,play the levels again and enemy will probly do something diffrent and you probly will it can get difficult at times.graphics are amazing hope you got that HD TV,sound is great.This game is every good as gears of war in some parts better,for those not familiar to rainbow six and are thinking this game may be to technical with all the weapons,commands,and military talk believe me its not its simple to use your team and set your weapons,thats not to say the gameplay dont get tough though becouse it does,if you can play gears of war you can play this,dont miss out"
4,It grows on you,"Good title filled with enough shooting to keep me and my friends busy. However, the graphics are not as clean as I would have thought they would be. Especially after playing Gears of War and the insane details in graphics. But with that being said, multiplayer co-op is tight. A definite buy for any person that likes shooters."
2,Not that great.,"If you like shooting for 10 minutes then searching for what your supposed to do for 45 minutes then this game is for you. Some maps have objectives others don't so you end up spending most of the time just walking around trying to figure out what to do. Also no way to save games except at checkpoints. First run of the game there was a programing error that would not let me advance, without the ability to save the game I had to start all over again."
4,Great Game,Got this game for my son because all his friends have it and he wanted to play live with xbox360. He has fun playing with it for hours and would also recommend his other favorite Gears of War. He likes to switch back and forth with his games until Halo 3 comes out.
4,no slip shower/bath tub strips,"this item works well, however, it would have helped to have a better description as to the number of strips in the package. Also, the package didn't really give you a diagram of how to place the strips on the shower floor. They do work however, and serve the purpose intended."
2,horrible,had these before from a store nearby my house didnt have them so i found herereceived them and applied them and within first shower they came off
2,They peel after a while,They are easy to install and worked nicely at first but after about a month to six weeks they are all peeling off.
5,Non-slip shower treads,"Excellent product, easy to apply. Be sure to clean the bottom of the tub or shower and make sure it is dry before applying strips. I would recommend this product. It works GREAT!"
2,Aren't sticking well,These started peeling up after first shower. May be because of shape of our tub as it is more curved toward the drain. Easy to cut and place.
2,Applied properly; did not last more than a month.,"I followed all the directions, even the difficult to accommodate detail of letting the adhesive cure for 24 whole hours. Sixty percent of these 14.5 inch strips have failed, peeling off. I applied a mix of these and the7.5"" Non-Slip Safety Shower Treadsby the same manufacturer. Those have, so far, held up."
1,Not what I expected.,"The item arrived promptly with no issues. Used seven of the eight strips, applying them as instructed. Within ten days one peeled up, was replaced with the spare strip. Three others lifted and had to be removed within the next three weeks.Not something I'd recommend, too bad because they looked like just the right product for my needs."
4,Great for baby pool!,I used these on the bottom of a vinyl baby pool to keep my toddler from slipping all around. They worked very well! Definitely helped make the pool much safer for my son's use.
2,Non-Slip but also Non-Stick,"I put these down onto a new, clean, unused shower floor. I made sure they were well stuck to the tile. The shower wasn't used for days afterward. They lasted about 5 or 6 showers before they started coming off."
4,"much thinner and less conspicuous, but not as textured","these treads are much thinner and less conspicuous than others I've bought in the past -- these look much better in the tub: they don't scream ""tacky!"" And they're thinner so don't feel as weird to the feet. But they feel less textured. When brand new, they seem to reduce slip potential well, but how will they work once there has been some soap residue? (no, I do not scrub the tub daily) Cannot report on long term use yet."
5,Work as advertised.,"Treads apply very easily. I have had them down for over two months, and none have peeled thus far. They provide more than adequate traction in shower without feeling abrasive or uncomfortable on your feet. I was pleasantly surprised that they are not very noticeable to the eye on my off-white tub. Overall, price is right, they work as expected, and I would recommend to others."
1,Did Not Stay Stuck,Lasted less than a week before they loosened. Will try sandpaper treads for stairs to see if they work better.
2,Poor product,"I think these are poor. The clear ones are not clear, but rather, they are just dingy looking. They started peeling after only four baths. Not recommended."
3,Better for those who print lightly,"I print a lot of documents on my computer. The Epson printer came with my computer package. I have found that you lose ink rapidly when you print regularly, even with the ink reduction option on your software. However, Epson printers & inks are the best quality that I have seen. The ink does not skip or bleed as easily as the other brands."
4,Great Ink,Epson inks have been really good for me ever since I bought my first Epson printer 4 years ago. I have never had a cartridge go out on me. The ink quality is comparable to those from HP if not better. I would recommend that you stick with Epson ink and not use the other ink. The quality and ease of use is just not there. The only complaint about the ink is that I wished that the color tanks where separated for one could buy each one individually. Overall a great product.
4,The Book is as tasty as the topic,Mr. Keith Brown has a unique way of providing keen and inspiring insight. His style of writing is flavoraful and incredibly insightful. I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking that inspiration and instruction in the every day affairs of life.
4,"Excellent hardware, decent software","The actual unit itself is really really great, but the included SageTV Lite software is not very stable. Seemingly at random, it will just stop recording right in the middle of a show, usually after I've had it running for a day or so. I highly recommend this product, but the Java-based software should be restarted daily if you want to have reliable recording."
5,Classic,"This was my favorite Disney cartoon when I was little, and I was delighted when we ordered it for our daughter and she's watched it probably 25 times so far. Great Value and classic movie."
2,A rough start,"Sounding particularly shrill, Mike Scott is very much out front in this first Waterboys CD. All original songs work to this CD's disadvantage. There is no break from the band's worst faults, like bad poetry (""Old Spirit"") and poor similes (""Your life is like an ocean,"" ""Your love feels like trumpets"" both from ""Trumpets"") that the occasional reworking of an Irish standard helps compensate for. There are some good tunes here, like the epic title track and ""Don't Bang the Drum"" with its passionate commentary about appreciating the beauty before you. But the overall effect is a band trying to find its way."
4,The Warriors a great action movie of an era gone bye !!!!!!!!,The Warriors a great action movie of an era gone bye !!!!!!!! done beautifuly with excellent cinematogrophy !!!!!!watch it you won't be sorry !!!!!!
5,Warriors.....Come out to play-a......,"In my opinion this is THE BEST gang movie ever made. I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters, which would have made me 9 years old. My friends and I even dressed up as The Furies for Halloween in the 6th grade. And how funny that those same friends and I are going to do it for Halloween this year and we're all in our 30's!The soundtrack rocks and so does the movie. I won't go into detail, because I'm sure most of you know what it's about. If you haven't seen it yet, do so now!"
1,"Thats a bummer. I mean, that's a bummer, thats a bummer man...","Well I must say, we, the producers of the Warriors, have over the years lost many brain cells and could no longer understand the movie we had wrought when confronted with the challenge of transferring it to HD.Also, it sure seemed scary didn't it?Therefore we have simplified and hopefully un-scaryfied it a bit by framing it into a comic book reality by adding word balloons and an awesome cgi comic intro.Also, looking back we regret not having the technology to digitize Cyruss to a chinese man to avoid any similarities to Obama, who as we all know is a real person, not a pretend leader of a bunch of ruthless gang bangers.Regretfully yours,The producers of this travesty."
1,"THE FILM IS GREAT, THE DVD STINKS","The Warriors is one of my favorite films of all time..it is one of the ultimate cult films ever made. How can they release this DVD with nothing more than a lousy trailer? Where is the deleted scene that was only seen on ABC TV in NY on the old Friday Night Movie (at the beggining they showed the Warriors, in daylight, hanging out on the boardwalk talking about the trip to the Bronx before the classic ""wonder Wheel"" night-train scene)? How could they have left all this out? Where is Walter Hill's commentary????? Where are the interviews with the actors? The photo galleries? The contest to get an official WARRIORS vest? (OK--maybe I'm pushing it a little bit here). PLEASE Paramount--re-release this. How can you have released such a lame DVD to a film with such a HUGE and LOYAL following?..."
2,Great Movie But Bad Blu Ray,Man was I furious to see how much this film was changed when I re-watched this directors cut. This new version improves on nothing and only serves only to distract from the original classic. The weird cuts and bad introduction really take away from the film. Plus the whole comic book transitions just don't fit. All these things ruin the pacing of the film and if this is one of your favorite movies then it is bound to bother you. The special features and picture quality are pretty good though.
3,"""The Warrior's"" New Look","I am a pretty big fan of this film and had been wanting to see it again for several months before I purchased it from Amazon. I got myself all ready to watch it...dark room, popcorn, Dots, etc. I was pumped. But the director chose to make some pretty serious changes to the movie. He, apparently, always thought there was a comic book flavor to the film (which I can see) and so he added comic book scenes into this version of the movie. I didn't care for them. Throughout most of the film I was able to get over it (although I found them jarring), but the ending of the movie was JUST AWFUL. One of my favorite parts of the film is watching everyone walk down the beach to ""In the City"". He removed this part and just had it end with a comic book scene of them on the beach. I hated it and am still very disappointed. I wish I could get my hands on the original version of this film."
4,"The new gang in town--""The Whining Nerds""","I can't say I'm a huge fan of the comic book transitions or the lack of deleted scenes (the box doesn't claim to have 'em), but shee--people are sure babies about this one. This is an amazing transfer of a pristine print of the film. Visually and aurally, this is perfect. If you respect the director's vision, this'll suit you fine, but if you're a nit-picky fanatic who can't stand change, I guess you should go buy a used DVD/VHS (seriously?) copy of the original at $80--mediocre transfer, sound, and all. Or better yet, make your own movie and shut up already. Cry all you want, but revel in the beauty of this film and pick up the eventual ""super"" version of this when the re-make(gasp) comes out. That release will hopefully satiate the insufferable anal-retentives of the world."
4,Review of Warriors,The warriors is an awsome movie a little bit out dated but still phenomonal get the ultimate collectors cut because it makes a big difference
3,Nostalgic...,I purchased this movie because it was 1 of my favorites when it was released...I first saw it at the movies...very cool film. This is a cult favorite.
5,The Warriors,Directors Cut was great. Brought back memories of when I first saw the movie.The movie was crystal Clear which made it more enjoyable to watch.
5,Fast delivery,Great movie fom the 80's. It brought back many memories of seeing movies at drive-in. A must add to your 80's collection. Thank you
5,Should've been a Grade A movie!!,"I have loved this movie since its debut. My son (17) and I caught it on a cable channel and he fell in love with it also. He begged me to order it for our collection. I normally don't like changes to old music, movies, etc. like alterations and remakes. This director's cut has such subtle changes that I feel they only enhance the whole package."
3,Classic New York Flick,This DVD of the Warriors is yet another print of a movie that should be in everyones library. This is a classic New York Flick that chronicles the life of new york turf gangs in the seventies. There are no real features but the DVD allows for smoother playing and clearer veiwing than a tape would. If you get the DVD it should be for the clear images of the cheesy gimmick gangs and beautifully choreographed street fights. Definately worth look by those that enjoyed A CloakWork Orange.
3,Why couldnt they put the original film to blu ray?,The original Warriors is a great movie. Unfortunately this blue ray version has been ruined with comic book segues between many of the scenes. The stupidity of the comic book drawings is exceeded only be the lameness of the captions hinting at what will happen in the next scene. What a horrible hack of a great film.The only reason it gets 3 stars is for technical merit of those parts not butchered. The sound track and video quality are much better than the DVD version.
1,Poignant Blu-ray Review,"The Blu-ray has a sharp picture, decent sound, and some nice extras. However it does not include the original version so it sucks."
1,WTF? This is not The Warriors you remember! Do not buy!,"Do yourself a favor - if you are a fan of this film, DO NOT BUY THE ULTIMATE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!! You will regret it immediately. Animated transitions from scene to scene? The heavy handed Anabasis crap that they shoehorned into the story? Even the clarity of the images threw me off! Put it this way - two minutes into the UDC DVD, I was back on Amazon to purchase the original version. Yes - the audio has been cleaned up - so tf what? Walter Hill is one director who is clearly out of touch with the impact of his own work. It should've never been touched! This film demands its grain. It demands the classic look and feel that gave it its classic cult status. I know there are cinephiles out there who must have everything in HD, BluRay, whatever. Don't do it. Some things should stay old school."
2,"Skip the directors cut, get the original!","When I purchase a directors cut, I expect to see additional scenes that where cut during original production. I don't want to see a bunch of new stuff thrown on top of an old movie so that they can call it a ""special edition"". While this DVD does have very interesting interviews with the actors and director, the newly added comic book style cut scenes are terrible. The new cut scenes total destroy the rhythm of the film, come on guys. My advice is rent this one for the interviews, but buy the original."
5,Re-Mastered so Much Better!,"Just finished watching 'The Warriors'I have not seen this movie in 10+ years and was surprised at how well it has stood the test of time.Very Simplistic and yet Very Complex in it's story telling.Loved the cartoon angle infused in the Editing.The 5 stars is for the 'Special Features'.Very very cool to have the Director, Producers, Editors and Actors explaining the thought process of the movie and how some changes were made mid-flight during the actual shooting of the movie and the technical difficulties that arose and were overcome .A Must Have for Your Library!-Domo"
2,Wait for the Late Late Late Night Show,"Not all that. Action isn't interresting at all. Unless you're between the ages of 13 to when ever a person grows-up...lol. IT'S BORING! But, viewing is not for those under 17."
4,"Negative Reviewers - ""Get A Life""","Ok people, listen up. This will only take a second. Get on with your boring life. These naysayers are pathetically pathetic! It was a cheap little action movie filmed in the late 70's that's entertaining for what it's supposed to be.That said, the new ""director's"" cut is a bunch of noise about nothing. Do I like the comic book fade-in? No, I think they're weak, but it doesn't really detract from the movie viewing experience. Hey people, we're not taking Ben-Hur here, it's the friggin Warriors! Get over it. Take it as it is and get on with your life. Jeez!"
2,Great Movie on TV...Way too much cussing on movie!,One of my favorite movies...ON T.V.The actual movie version was horrible with tons of horrible language!
1,Pretty crappy movie,"I should have given it a 1.5 stars instead of 1, but Amazon doesn't allow half stars. Anyhow, I just bought this DVD (in the original theatrical release version) based on some fairly positive reviews. I must say I got burned. Major issues: bad screen play and the movie is padded (you could cut the running time in half without losing anything).I am guessing that the guy who wrote the screen play learned about NYC gangs by watching West Side Story. He then added in some dialogue borrowed from some hippie films. Right there, you know this is going to be cheesy. Sadly, it was not cheesy good, it was cheesy bad.The reason it was cheesy bad is because 1/2 of the film is footage of a bunch of Fame extras walking around NYC. So while I appreciate the ""so bad it's good"" thing, any humor provided by the goofy dialogue was lost in the ensuing walking scenes.In the plus column: zombie baseball players, black hockey stick wielding ninjas, & sinister use of 3 empty pop bottles."
5,Cult Classic,"This is a very entertaining movie, although I seriously doubt if street gangs have ever been so unintentionally humorous. Compared to the reality of what street gangs do, these gangs seem more like contestants for a reality show. That is not a slam on the movie, I believe the movie was just a sign of the times. It's a shame Michael Beck didn't get better roles after this film, although I've read that his casting in the absolute stinker ""Xanadu"" may have seriously derailed his career. Still, I think he's great as the impromptu leader of the representatives of the Warrior gang. Overall I think this is a fun movie. The words ""fun"" and ""street gang"" usually don't belong in the same sentence, but this movie is purely entertaining."
4,Survival against the odds and ultimate redemption in futuristic gangland New York,"This ""Ultimate Director's Cut"" of ""The Warriors"" unashamedly emphasizes the comic book nature of the film.Director Walter Hill goes out on a limb to create an alternative reality of gang culture - and succeeds brilliantly.""The Warriors"" is somewhat influenced by Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" in styling but has a much lighter tone.Acted with conviction by a large cast (no-one plays a weasally villain better than David Patrick Kelly), ""The Warriors"" makes brilliant use of New York street and subway locations.Still holds up well after all these years because it stands outside contemporary concerns to explore the timeless themes of survival against the odds and ultimate redemption.Excellent featurettes on the making of the film are included on this DVD."
3,come out to play,this movie was amazingly good. i really liked the old subway and coney island scenes. I'm not sure that gangs actually dressed like some of the people in the movie ie. clowns? pink taffeta shirts? I was surprised to see one of samantha's boyfriends from sex and the city in it. i was particularly impressed by how absolutely crazy the actor who said come out to play was and i would really like to know who he is and what else he's done. can anyone help? the movie is definitely worth watching.
4,whos wants to play...,"...This movie is one I remember watching when I was a little boy and now watching it as a much older boy. I liked it just the same. Brings back memories of the old days .. well back in the 80s were the old days for me.The dvd could have had more extras, but its an old school movie. Plus the gangs wear cool get ups, make up and stuff...."
1,Fantastic Flick but DVD is sorely lacking!,"How can the studio not honor this retro cult classic with a fully-packed special 25th anniversary edition?! And where's the all important documentary on the release of the film in '79, when teen crowds across the US went wild and attacked police, destroyed theatres, etc... Only ten years old at the time of its release, what I remember most about the Warriors is seeing the nightly news reporting that the movie should be banned, due to the violence it was causing out in the streets! A truly strong film at the time and a strong piece for a DVD time capsule. What's really ironic is that in today's world, compared with the flix out there now, The Warrior's would be released as a bad after-school special - very tame compared with present standards. Too funny and a great classic! GENTLEMEN, GIVE US THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION!!"
1,Wrong Region,DVD sent was for wrong region. Why would I buy a DVD you can't play in the US?? Apparently the region was stated but I believe I was misled.
3,Walter Hill should have done better,"I was actually WAITING for a new updated Warriors release, because I knew that 25 years were coming up.I WAS pleased to see the stories behind the making of the movie but I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the finished product itself.Where did all of these cartoon cutouts come from between scenes?Was this REALLY Walter Hill's vision in 1978 or 27 years later in 2005?I could have ignored all of that, but, to me, the most egregious error is Hill cutting off the last scene in the movie, during the credits, when they were all walking off into the sunrise.That was a nice way to end this movie and I don't know WHY he was so fascinated with this comic book motif, that he would cut this scene off COMPLETELY to use these comic book pictures to end the film.However, I'll still give it three stars because this is the first time I've seen this cult classic on dvd."
1,"If I'd only known this was one of those ""updated"" movies...","I'd have never bought it. If you are a Warriors fan DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. I assumed that by ""Ultimate Director's Cut"" They meant that they maybe cleaned up some scenes, added scenes, added some bonus features, anything but what I got. The movie begins with an apology from the Director which anticipates some of the abhorrent changes they made to the movie. This version is a total disgrace, violates much of the enchanting qualities of the film, and uses Comic Sans font none the less for the absolutely disruptive comic book scenes... Unwatchable in my opinion."
1,"Great Movie, but DO NOT BUY this version.","I love The Warriors. I hate this cut. As many have mentioned in great detail, the ""Ultimate Director's Cut"" includes idiotic comic book cutting/editing/graphics. It ads nothing to the original version and takes much away. Therefore, if you want to buy The Warriors, do not buy this version. I'm going to have to buy this movie again b/c I hate this DVD that much."
4,Classic camp,"This film is an adaptation of Anabasis by Xenophon, not The Odyssey by Homer, which tells the story of Greek mercenaries being stranded in Persia after the Persian leader Cyrus was killed in battle. Further, The Warriors and Anabasis share the same dramatic ending of finding safety by the sea (and Xenophon with his famous quote ""Thalassa, thalassa! (the sea, the sea!)"".The film was contoversial in 1979 when it was released, but it is good campy fun. I first saw it on Halloween on HBO in 1980 when I was in sixth grade. Far from inspiring my friends and me to participate in gang related violence, the film only inspired u to put empty beer bottles on the tips of our fingers and bang them in unison.The Warriors is a great, absorbing film with very broad acting and with lots of attitude. I wouldn't want to meet the leader of the Grammercy Riffs in a dark alley."
3,The Warriors,I had not seen The Warriors in years but the movie still holds your attention and has aged quite well.
4,besides that this is a very good movie...,"it also gave me a big kick to see the later well known actors Michael Beck & James Remar in one of their first roles ! BUT, most of all ! the DEBUT of the marvellous (& later Oscar winner) MERCEDES RUEHL ! wich was not even mentioned in some versions ! (on tv) Great movie !"
5,Oh warriors.....come out and play-ay,"I first saw this when it was released, and was happy it was out on dvd..I liked the new editing with the graphics between acts. Its a golden oldie"
1,"Blows,big time !","I recently bought this at Big Lots on sell for pennies.I've loved the movie ever since I saw it at the local grindhouse years ago.When will I ever learn to read these reviews before I buy.Not the movie I remember,that's for sure.Pennies was too much for this travesty.Thanks for nothing,Wally!"
4,Great Action Film About the Realities Of Gang Violence,"Even though it was made in 1979, Walter Hill's 'The Warriors' is still enjoyable to watch. This well-made film deals with many issues that are common with today's urban gangs. It does glorify it a lot but it does make you think.I heard about gang violence breaking out when 'The Warriors' was originally released in theatres. In 1988, there was talk about gang riots being associated with the release of the film 'Colors'. I think it was nothing but a publicity stunt.I'm glad that this film along with with past great films are being released on DVD. There is one thing that disappoints me:The film has an aspect of 1:85.1 even though the widescreen aspect ratio is described as 'anamorphic'."
3,A good film.,"""The Warriors"" is a good film. I went to the cinema with my friends many moons ago to see it. It has a good story, good actors [a few of whom have gone onto accomplished careers], vivid cinematography & the fast paced action style that director Walter Hill is now so well known for. A good show."
4,great movie,it is a classic. old school gangs going at itloved it!!!old style movie with lots of gritgood stuff
3,Something's Missing,"Based on seeing ""The Warriors"" on Joe Bob Briggs' ""Monster Vision"", I know for a fact that there is extra/deleted scenes lurking around that need to be restored, or put on as extras. Its disappointing that such an incredible film receives no extras on the DVD edition. This should be looked into."
3,I just can't care about a bunch of punks beating eachother up for no reason,"The Warriors are a gang of thugs from Coney Island. They are led to a meeting with all the major gangs. It turns out to be an ambush. Now they must fight their way back to Coney Island. Through alleys, parks, subways, and under bridges. No matter where they go, someone is out to get them.This movie has some pretty good action and some parts that I thought were funny. Even though the movie was well written, and directed, I just can't get into a story about a bunch of street punks beating each other up for no good reason. If you someone is fighting for something important like family or country, I can get into that. This movie is just about thugs, and I really just don't care. I'll give the screenplay and directing 5 stars, but the subject matter 1 star. That's an average of 3."
4,the warriors,"This is a classic in my opinion. The director's cut is a lot better than the theatrical version that I remember. I like the whole comic book aspect of the d.c. Some of the dialogue is a little hollywoodish and outdated, but all in all this movie has style and excitement which has stood the test of time. The soundtrack is dope too! a good addition to the collection!"
5,GREAT MOVIE !!!!!! GREAT SELLER!!!!,RECIEVED THIS MOVIE FASTPACKAGING WAS AWESOMETHIS IS A RARE FIND AND SELLER HAD ITLOVE THIS MOVIE ITS A MUST SEETHANKS
4,This Is The Version You Want...,"ASIN: B0000541AMhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis is the original widescreen (Anamorphic) version that we all loved when we saw it so long ago.The Directors Cut ""comic book"" version is a travesty that destroys the film."
2,Director's CUT alright!,"They totally switched around the whole scene with the lezzys and left out the best line of the movie ""these girls would rather s***w each other than s***w us"", plus they totally chopped out the dispute over who's going to be the new warlord and they try to make it look like a comic book story and where's the extra scenes? You guys hanging out with the guys who chopped up Requiem For A Heavyweight dvd - Thanks, now I'm stuck with this dvd!"
3,I like the Original Cut Better - But this is good for a Fan or Collector,I would suggest finding the original theatrical release of this film if you want to relive the memories from the first time you saw the movie and especially if you want to share it with a friend who has never seen it before. I think the director's cut is more for a true Warriors Fan-like myself. The original version was more suspenseful and in my opinion the tempo is more of a thrill ride. I do like the Director's cut with the added Comic Book cut away scenes but it just didn't seem to move as well as the original. Still an awesome soundtrack and characters etc...
1,The Warriors - The Ultimate Directors Cut,"DId not enjoy the directors cut. One of my favorite movies, but the directors cut ruined it for me. Get the ORIGINAL."
2,"""Ultimate Director's Cut"" DVD gets 2 Stars for 4 star movie","You've got to love Walter Hill -- he starts out by very haughtily decrying Special Edition DVDs but saying that his masterpiece The Warriors is an exception... for basically the same reasons as George Lucas and every other director has given for their mucked-up Special Eds. Nice try, Walt.Worse, he has butchered his own film into a comic-strip digital monstrosity, replete with cheesy digital graphics and a terrible intro. that evinces nothing much more than a glossing of Steven Pressman. This is really inexcusable when it comes to a film like The Warriors, where its reputation lies primarily in its late-70s atmosphere."
3,"DVD - ""THE WARRIORS""",QUALITY & DEFINITION COULD BE BETTER. SOUND WAS OK. COLOR WAS OK. PRICE WAS OK. WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE OTHER '70'S MOVIES.
2,The Warriors (ultimate directors cut),I did not like the director's cut. There are scenes that are left out that to me made the movie was it was. I would have preferred the original cut!
2,Get the original,"A great cult classic destroyed by a terrible directors cut. The comic book scene intercuts are ridiculous. Anyone who watches this version first, instead of the original, will wonder what the fuss is about.The documentary is worth it though. Most of the main characters cooperate with interviews. Don't let the box fool you: it says there are 4 featurettes. THERE IS ONLY ONE, THEY DIVIDE IT INTO 4 PARTS. But it is worth the low purchase price. Keep (or get) the original version for watching the movie, but get this one only if you are a huge Warriors fan. The (one) documentary is enjoyable."
2,DO NOT BUY THE DIRECTORS CUT - PLEASE READ,OMG.... WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THIS CLASSIC FILM? YOU WENTBACK AND COMPLETELY BUTCHERED A GREAT FILM LIKE A LITTLEGREEDY OLD GEORGE LUCAS WHO TWEAKED GREEDO'S PISTOL.I AM TYPING IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE THEY RUINED THE BEST SCENEIN THIS CLASSIC FILM (WHEN THE WARRIORS FIRST SEE THE BASEBALLFURIES). OMG THEY INSERTED COMIC BOOK PAGES AND ACTUAL BUBBLETEXTS!!! SOME PARTS IF NOT ALL THEY USE THE DEFAULT COMIC SANSTEXT WHICH IS SO PLAYED OUT. I HATE YOU FOR MAKING THIS DIRECTOR'SCUT...PLEASE SET FIRE TO THIS DVD IF YOU BOUGHT IT BY MISTAKE.PLEASE BUY THE ORIGINAL CUT.Thank you. :)
3,Comic book additions are terrible,THE BASEBALL FURIES!!!Talk about ruining a scene. They should have at least included the theatrical release in this disk for people who don't like their cult classics screwed up by directors. We ALREADY REALIZED THAT THIS MOVIE WAS AN EXAGGERATION AND CARICATURE!!! We don't need you to FORCE the idea on us with drawings!!Dumb!!!
2,Why? Why do all directors sell out?,"Don't buy this version of the movie it's a waste of money. Nothing that was added did anything to make the movie better but what it did do is destroy the gritty, underground cult feel of this classic 70's flick...Do all of these directors take the same class as George Lucas on how to destroy your own masterpieces?BUY THE ORIGINAL DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD..."
4,An amazing older film with an amazing transfer to Blu-ray,"I had been hearing about The Warriors for years, but never had the opportunity to watch it. Once it hit Blu-ray, I finally put it in my rental queue to see what all the fuss was about. After my initial viewing, I just had to order a copy of my own immediately. I definitely know why this film is regarded as the cult classic as it is. Great characters and a simple, yet engaging story. A gang, wrongly accused of a crime, must fight ther way back home. No fancy effects, no silly one-liners. Just a group of guys going through a brutal fight to get to where they need to be. And visually? I dont know what the original DVD looked like, as Blu-ray is my only reference. But honestly, if you hadn't told me it was an older film, I would have guessed it was filmed this year, along with a really good costume design team. Another fine example of what a great new way to enjoy movies the Blu-ray format provides."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though the director's cut detracts from the movie, The Warriors is an exciting and stylish urban western about a gang of Coney Island toughs who have to fight all night just to get home; a deserved cult classic, the film is a must-see for anyone who likes well-made action movies."
4,Great flick,"I first saw this movie about 15 years ago in high school. It was great fun then and remains so today.While certainly not one of the most intellectually challenging films ever made, it is nonetheless one of the funnest to watch. To those few reviewers who seem hung up with the comic book plot and action - that is exactly the point. I don't think this movie was ever intended to be viewed as anything but a well directed and furiously paced action/adventure film (speaking of furiously paced how many amoung us could run almost the entire length of Manhattan and still be able to stand on much less walk to Coney Island beach the next morning?). I wholeheartedly agree with all those before me who say this is one of their favorite movies it is one of mine also. If you are in the mood for a fun, if somewhat quirky action film with some quick lessons about friendship and loyalty thrown in this film is for you."
4,They're blind and deaf or liars or idiots or all of these,"THE AUDIO AND VIDEO OF THIS FLICK ARE JUST FINE!!! I find it tame and don't see what ever was so shocking about it. But I'm liking it very much just the same. Guess I'm just jaded by the gap in time. It's warm and amusing and all 4 men are perfect. I prefer Monty Python to whom I see a resemblance. I recommend you rent it before buying it to make sure you like it. I did (because I was scared off by these dishonest nincompoops who said the picture and sound were lousy, they aren't), I ordered a copy about 2 hours ago."
4,A must for theatre collectors,"This version will not be as accessible to American audiences as the vinyl recording version released on Capitol Records in the 1960's. To the contemporary audience ""Beyond the Fringe"" will not seem as ground-breaking as it was in its time. Some of the most interesting footage for this theatre director was that of the audience's responses. There was a time when people actually dressed up to go to the theatre. You can't have everything, I guess, but you can have this DVD and dream."
1,Pig in a poke,It was not until I had paid for and received that I suspected that it won't work outside the USA/Canada. I didn't see this information in the product advertisement
1,"Filth masqerading as ""Comedy""","Like too many wanna-be ""Comedians"" today, the performer tries to make up for any genuine wit, or comedic brilliance with Triple-X FILTH!Unlike true comedians such as Jeff Foxworthy; this guy has the IQ of a toad.Save your money. I'd give this item ZERO stars if possible."
2,Very smelly and doesn't work well,The reviewer who described the smell as orange and perm cream mixed together nailed it right on the head. I am trying to strip a 50+ year old bookcase with at least two layers of lead paint in various colors. I put the first coat on last night and waited about 20-22 hours before attempting to scrape. It is not going well. I scraped as much as I could but had to put on another thicker coat and we'll see what the results are tomorrow. I am seriously considering trying SoyGel if only to get something that is not so smelly and toxic.
1,"Poor results on concrete, metal","Does not work on concrete, despite repeated, thorough, applications that are left overnight. Leaves an orange stain on concrete that can only be lifted with a scrub brush and hot water and lots of elbow grease. Essentially: Open wallet. Waste money."
2,Doesn't work that great,"After reading all the reviews, I expected the product's performance to be better. I used it to strip 3 layers off kitchen cabinets. I had to reapply the product THREE times! If you have a week to spare, you might not find this problematic. If you want to get the job done most efficiently, use a regular stripper. I chose to use it because I was working in an area with minimal ventilation. If I could have had access to more ventilation, I would recommend more effective stripper.Pros: Easy to apply; fumes don't seem as toxic as other strippers.Cons: Orange smell could be tempting to a child, never leave this product unattended. Works about 50% effectiveness of other strippers."
4,Great product!!,"I purchased this product to remove 50+ years of paint from some old stainless steel kitchen cabinets and restore them to their original look. I was looking for something that would allow me to do this without removing them. I decided to give this stuff a try and I'm glad I did. There were no toxic fumes filling my kitchen and within a few hours, decades of paint peeled right off."
2,The magic answer to stripping - not!,"As far as I'm concerned, the search for a near drinkable, good smelling stripper has achieved so-so results at best. I'm removing one coat of latex painting and one coat of oil paint from my deck. I put on a thick coat of Citri-Strip and allowed it to stay on overnight. I then scraped and pressure washed - some of the first layer and a little of the second (in a few areas) came off. Hmmm.....not so hot to say the least and A LOT of Citri-Strip! I then tried a coat of Strip-Ease. Thirty minutes later I lightly scraped, then pressure washed and guess what - I was down to bare wood on most of the deck. Another light coat of Strip-Ease, pressure washed and it was perfect! I'm the environmentally conscious type but with some jobs there's a reason a product has been around forever! Of course, one could make this a month long project."
1,"Very disappointed, did not work for me","I have an old solid wood bookcase that was given to me..It is bright yellow, not sure what is underneath. I purchased Citristrip and gave it a good coat, waited a couple of hours (directions say 30 min-24 hrs)and started scraping and scraping for about 2 hours and only part of the yellow came off (first layer), under that is green and I do not know what kind of paint it is, and under that appears to be stained.So now I am still trying to just get the first coat off. This product does not take off several layers as they advertise and is very difficult to scrape off. Not happy with this product at all."
1,Not as strong as other products,I've striped wood finishes before with OTHER products and had no problems other than the fumes are strong. Citri-Strip smells fine but takes repeated applications letting it sit for 15 hours at a pop to get it to loosen the poly finish I'm trying to strip. In the future I'll wait until the spring/summer for my stripping projects and get a decent product.
1,Overrated weak stripper that turns into a nasty chemical powder,I used an entire quart of Citristrip on a front door which was painted with standard Dunn Williams exterior paint. It only stripped parts of the door into patches and in other spots it wouldn't strip the paint at all. I applied Citri with a paintbrush and left it on for 7-24 hours as the directions indicated. I scraped off the first coat and tried a second coat then left it on for awhile and came back hours later and it didn't work either. Save your money this stuff is garbage not to mention it dries into a dusty chemical residue that blows in the air doing who knows what to your lungs if you're not wearing a particle half mask.
5,Great stuff!,I recently bought an older home. The kitchen cabinets had caked on paint layers about 7 deep. I purchased some Citristrip paint remover because the container said it didn't have harsh fumes. As a person with asthma that makes all the difference. I put the Citristrip onto the surface of the cabinet I'm stripping and wait about 45 minutes and the layers and layers of paint stripped right off. I've been very happy with this product.
3,"Effective for a ""safer"" stripping gel","I'm in the process of stripping some door frames that have four or five different types of stain/paint on them. This has done an excellent job of dealing with the bottom three layers--two different oil paints and a stain. It has a harder time dealing with all the layers at once. It just seems it can't quite penetrate the latex paint on top of everything else and then the oil paints and stain as well. On the plus side, it's relatively easy and inoffensive to work with. It smells strongly, but of citrus, not deathly chemicals."
3,It's OK,"I bought this product on the suggestion of my neighborhood hardware store. The people who own the store are old hippies and are into anything earth friendly. I was planning to refinish my kitchen cabinets that are white washed and had some type of clear coat from the 1990's decor. I followed the directions and after 30 minutes began scraping and sanding. The sanding did more good than the stripper did. I tried it on a different piece of wood with just normal sanding sealer and lacquer on it, bubbling began almost immediately. The product doesn't smell bad and according to the label is biodegradable. However, it doesn't work on everything. I ended up sandblasting my cabinet doors which if you have access to one; is quicker, less messy and fume-less. The blaster took the white wash finish down to bare wood and then only needed some light sanding with fine grit sandpaper."
5,Citri-Strip is excellent,"This is the best paint strip I have ever used. It is good to strip Victorian Ogee grooved window and door trim. I apply the Citri-Srip with a paint brush, then run a wire brush along the grooves, then dip the wire brush in a pail of water to clean it,then clean the residue with water using the wire brush. The wood is exposed, the grooves are clean, and ready to paint."
4,"Worked well, but shipping to Canada makes this a little pricey.","I purchased citristrip as I was stripping the floor in a 100 yr old home and didn't want to sand through the lead. The first application removed three or four layers of paint quite well after letting sit 24 hours, and I found the smell almost pleasant. The second application got me closer to the wood, but still not all the way. At this point I had used all of the product and didn't want to pay the shipping to bring more into Canada. I went to my local home depot and purchased ""SmartStrip"" at about $60 a gallon. The SmartStrip worked as well or better, had no offensive odor, and is environmentally friendly too. If Citristrip were easily available to me I would definitely use it again on smaller projects."
3,"Good, not great","This product is decent but there are better products on the market. I have used Safe Strip in the past and after one (thick) application I was able to litterally WIPE away 50 year old thick mastic stuck on my bathroom walls after we removed the old tiles. No damage to the plaster. When I ran out of Safe Strip and went back to the store to get more, they didn't carry it and the employee reccommended the Citristrip as an alternative. SInce it was half the price, I gave it a try. After one application it turned the mastic into a soft bubble gum like substance that required a TON of scraping and started damaging the plaster. After two more coats, we were able to get the same resutls as one coat of the safestip. Bottom line....this stuff is ok but you are better off spending a few more dollars on the safestrip"
1,NOT good for concrete patio!,"I used this and two other products...the winner? Behr concrete paint stripper No 992. Do not waste your time with Citri-Strip or the other similar one on Amazon...Behr, KICKED IT'S A$$ with one treatment. I am STILL applying more coats of the other crap to do the same job. Amazingly inept!"
3,Tape with vertical numbering,"I am still looking for tape with metric numbering running from bottom to top. These still need to be readable by a child as they are going on a growth chart. Can you please help me or direct me to another site because my growth chart has come to a standstill because I can't find something suitable. Your site was quite helpful, but didn't fill the criteria. Thanks Nancyfromaus"
4,Excellent watch for the price,I wasnt expecting this watch to be this good. Feels and looks great. The second arm is noisy though. Good watch for the price you pay.........
1,Do not buy this watch,This watch does not measure up to all that it says. I bought this watch in July of this year and it does not keep time. I change the battery and still does not keep time it is not water resistant the watch misted up. I have not contacted Famous Brand Watches who sold it to me to get feed back. But it is a waste of money go for a Casio Instead.
3,"Fine, but not my favorite flavor.","I love most Erin Baker's flavors, but this one was just so-so. Unfortunately I bought a lot of them. Fortunately, I've had good luck freezing this product. The peanut butter flavor is a bit bland. Would be good with choc chips, raisins or something."
2,Not their best flavor,"While I do prefer the size of these cookies to the larger ones, I did not like this cookie. Upon opening the package there was an off smell, not appetizing in the least. And they simply don't taste great and have a very mild peanut flavor (I really couldn't tell they were peanut butter at all). I have tried the Morning glory in the larger size, and the fruit and nut. The morning glory was my favorite, and I would probably buy it again, but I would not buy this peanut butter flavor again. I'm hoping my hungry teenagers will enjoy them because there are 48 cookies total. I was disappointed in this cookie and would not recommend it."
3,I will show you my apricot.......,"So, yes this is a farce. But the fact that it has many directors shows in the inconsistent flow of the movie. So watch it for what it is, a idiotic movie that will make you laugh if you allow your self to overlook the flaws of the movie.I can tell you this for sure, the movie is better than my review!"
4,"if you liked ""the specials"" get this!","This is a truly wonderful gem by some of the former musicians from the seminal 80's SKA band ""The Specials"". I used to have it on vinyl, wore it out, and now I'm buying the CD. The highlights on the album have to be ""Free Nelson Mandela"", written while he was still jailed in SA - exhuberant, and although in a SKA guise, with the same emotional context as South African township music - protest music that that will move your feet and your heart and will run continually in your head when it's not on your headphones. The rest of the album is haunting. ""Racist Friend"" and ""Alcohol"" in particular are great songs. If ""More Specials"" the second Specials album made any impression on you, then this is worth sitting on your CD shelf alongside it."
4,Great album,"No its not the original Specials lineup or sound but its still great, if you like the specials, fun boy 3 then get this."
5,Simple and Easy to Follow,"This book is one I use daily while working with customers in my job. It offers simple steps and easy methods to diffuse situations and make my day run better while resulting in an increase in refferals and a number of big accounts growing larger because of our service, which I credit to this book here."
3,It's an o.k. book.,"Purchased as a text.Some good information but the class didn't use the text much. I read most of it before the class started and although it was a dry subject and several of the sections and examples were dated, it served its purpose."
2,How to put together a rock band.,"I found the story difficult to read because of the continuing references to putting together the music and all that it entails. So many references to the different types of guitars, their sound, their place in a band, how it co-mingles and mixes with a drummer and a singer. Lots of lyrics which I didn't appreciate either. I found myself reading skimming chapter after chapter since I felt like I was reading a 'how to'book on the making of a rock band.I didn't feel enough attention was given to the main character and how and why he slipped into a depression.For those readers who love reading about the day to day, drum beat by drum beat, and guitar sounds that make up a rock band - then this is the novel for you."
4,Good For The Price,"It serves it's purpose & makes all the wires look neater. The material is pretty thin, but what do you expect for a couple of bucks."
2,Stagnant and Risk-Free,"Boyz II Men are a vocally talented group that squanders every opportunity at musical maturity by singing professional, risk-free, unassertive Black pop. Aside from their contribution to the boyband craze, there isn't much else to distinguish Boyz II Men from the rest of the pack. If the title of their latest disc ""Full Circle"" implies that these guys took risks and worked with different-sounding material, then this record is a disappointment. We're treated to subpar ballads that are sung efficiently but with hardly any spontaneity. Only on the track ""That's Why I Love You,"" an engaging mid-tempo number, do the Boyz cut loose and get down. I had hoped that Boyz II Men would someday break themselves free and surprise me with an album full of unexpected spark and with an edge. But if ""Full Circle"" is any indication, I shouldn't be holding my breath."
1,This CD sucks!,"Wanya Morris gives the chance for the others to sing lead. Unfortunetely, they SUCK! this album sucks! If you liked MICHAEL/NAHTAN/SHAWNY/WANYA dont get this cd! But in Boyz II Men's defense, after their EMBARASSING Evolution cd, at least after that, now they know what they are good at, singing slow love songs. Boyz II Men sucks without wanya morris singing lead. They're are only two good songs on the cd, they are LONELY, and colors of love. however lonely is such a SAD song, i wouldnt recommend listening to that song too much. if you want a GOOD boyz II men cd.. try MICHAEL NATHAN SHAWN WANYA!this album is even worst than evolution! at least evolution had 3 good songs!"
5,Another solid release for Boyz II Men,"Boyz II Men will always be the best when it comes to harmonic ballads.What makes this album good is the ballads and slow melodies.Notable tracks:-Relax your Mind(ft Faith Evans) - This is a great intro song, slow/uptempo so you can sit back or get up and dance.-Color of Love - This is what Boyz II Men are all about. A classic ballad!-Oh Well - Sad ballad, meaningful lyrics-Whatcha need - good melodies and harmonies-On the road again - one of my favourites on the album. displays their ability to combine their voices.-Makin' Love (Interlude) - Okay, it's an interlude, BUT A VERY GOOD ONE INDEED!-Roll Wit Me - The only dance track that i liked, very non-Boyz II Men, but its pretty good-I'll Show You - the outro song. Strong ballads and great vocal capacity.Overall, this is a whole LOT better than their previous effort."
2,Done!Done!Done!,"got to hear this album a Month back&it's safe to say all the Usual Formula is here.they never escaped Being a Producer's GoldMine Act.these Guys can Sing but they still haven't found a way to Grow as Artist's to me overall.10 Years ago this was a Winning Formula 10 Years later sad to say most just don't care.they may have Sold a ton of Records at one time but the Market is different now&it seems more like 30 Years since they were on Top.Production,Sognwriting&Overall Presentation isn't too Good to me overall.Voices are Good but No feeling.very Average to me."
2,still haven't grown,There is nothing special about this release. It has new songs but it sounds like the same old stuff. It is going to be a slow mover and I would recommend waiting to buy it. The music just don't reveal their real talent and capabilies. This should have been the debut. Very dissappointing
2,disappointed...,"I've been a Boyz II Men fan since their first album in 1991, and I had high hopes for this latest endeavor. Unfortunately, the only song that really appealed to me was ""Color of Love."" I hate buying an album only to find one or two decent songs on it. I still consider ""Evolution"" to be their best work. I pray that this effort does not foreshadow any future work they do. My advice: buy the single, ""Color of Love,"" for the rest of the CD is worth the miss."
5,Growth At It's Best,"This album is the best of their works so far. The growth of each member can be heard as well as the growth of the group, especially in the cut entitled Oh Well. The album title Full Circle is well suited. Musically and lyrically they have come full circle since their debut album Cooleyhighharmony. After the last release, NMSW, I didn't think they could get any better. I have every confidence as long as they continue to sing, write, and produce in harmony every album hereafter will be better than the last. I look forward to future releases."
4,Aquatic Jive,"The DVD provided good instruction, unfortunately it is not one that you can put on watch and exercise with the DVD. It is more educational, excellent for someone just starting with the Aqua Jogger and wants to know how to use."
1,bad service,The product is ok but was sent with a piece missing. I attempted to find a way to contact Amazon but they put up such a maze it is crazy. Basicaly I would have to reject the entire order and send it back because I can not get in touch with them otherwise. BAD customer service.
1,Most Disappointing BFI Yet,"By far the most disappointing of the BFI film classics series that I've read so far. In contrast, check out the excellent Shawshank Redemption book in this series.Agree with previous reviewer - focuses way too much on the cultural phenomenon (and doesn't do a great job of that) and not enough on deconstructing analyzing the film in and of itself. Because of this focus, the book is already woefully out of date.Poorly written and really just plain boring.This film deserves better."
2,Does anyone understand what is going on in this movie?,"This movie is so stupid. It is incredibly boring, but has some good fights mixed in. Roc Tien Peng and some big guy perform well, and Leung Kar Yan and Jason Pai Paio have good cameo fight scenes. Most of the fights are good. SPOILER ALERT- what is up with the alien that comes out of the zombie's stomach?There is also a wheelchair fighter. Very weird movie, I just wish it made sense.2/5Picture quality on the Groundzero is bad, but its widescreen. Subtitles are very hard to read."
4,"Easy to use, great quality, but only decent battery life","I guess I shouldn't have expected too much in terms of battery life from this digital camera. Like most DC's, this one was also a battery hog, but until I purchase a camera with a long-life Li-ion battery that is stupidly-heavy, I shouldn't expect 3 months of uninterrupted use.Other than my beef with power usage, this camera is perfect in every way. Just the right amount of magnification (and more is purchaseable via add-on lenses), and the quality could not be better for the price. Definitely worth my time and money."
4,Kodak 240,"I really like mine. It takes good pictures. It was easy to get started with it. Do not try to buy a small camera bag for it because the lens cover will come off easily and you may accidentally turn it on when putting it into its bag. I highly recommend the USB disk reader, makes things a lot easier. With that reader you may not need the battary charger unless you want a slide show on your TV. Note that the Kodak 280 is offered here... [it] is probably more value. But, you will have to buy accessories so [it] will become a bit more after its all done. I can't say too much about how the pics print because I have been using it exclusively for Internet images. I am having fun with mine."
2,Uhhh ok....???,"Okay, I love house, I love hardcore, predominatley I love DJ BamBam, there is none realererrr. anyways, this album was a total disappointment to me. Its uninspired, boring and gives me that fake wannabe hardcore house feeling. I personally wouldnt recommend it, the tracks are bland and the same beat just continues on for too long, while DJ Venom tries to find the next track to mix (wait turn down no.1, play an intro, the turn up no.2) this is what he does throughout the whole cd. I mix with this now on my numark 818, its about all its good for."
3,"Skin softening, yes! Relief from hot flashes,no!","I was hoping the wild yam cream would help with hot flashes, but it doesn't, not at all. However, I did end up buying a second jar of this just because it feels very nice as a moisturizer. Not at all greasy. Like all the other JASON products that I have tried, this is a quality product...but balancing what? I have no idea. If you want relief from hot flashes you are going to have to go with a stronger, more expensive creams.10% Wild Yam isn't enough to notice any difference."
5,I love this album.,"Most of the Neo-con reviewers who give this 1 star, most likely enjoy their jazz as a museum artifact instead of Living breathing music, Most of the things complained about, are what I like the most about it. Howard Johnson's Tuba on Voodoo Chile is startling, but well executed. The arrangements are never boring, only the average Vocals on a few numbers can be complained about. If you like Funky music and have an open mind, you will not be disappointed. What was Gil Evans Thinking? I don't know, But I bet he wasn't to worried about what the stuffy jazz establishment was thinking while making it."
4,an original album,"I can hardly listen to music anymore. going to school for music has ruined everything ""commercial"" for me, so all I have left is extremely avant-garde rock, jazz, classical and experimental techno. With that said, this album has some very interesting arrangements for Jimi's songs, and I actually think I like a couple of them better than the originals (sorry JH fans!). Worth a listen at least.... not a 1 star album."
5,She's the greatest!,"You really don't have to be over 40 to do this tape. You can be any age because it does go at her usual pace. She is sweet and warm as she is in all her tapes. She is non-intimadating, very easy to follow, extremely cheerful, a very kind and warm human being. She is such a great person that I even got my husband and 22 year old daughter to use her tapes; they no longer use any one else's! I have a lot of her tapes that I ordered through Amazon and they are all good. You will really like them."
5,I enjoyed this video very much.,"Motivational without being intimidating. Leslie has a great personality. I've been exercising for 17 years and I'm 51 years old, and found the video to be perfect for my needs."
2,Poorly Done,This video if completely inferior to 2-Mile Walk -- also by Leslie Sansone. There are many awkward transitions and clumsy moments. Very disappointing. I never use it. I use the 2-Mile Walk Video a lot -- it's very good. Buy that one instead!
2,40 LUS WORKOUT wALK,The quality of the dvd was poor. which made it hard for me to see. I was really disappointed in it
3,"Not as good as ""Two-mile Walk"" video","I bought this video to alternate with the Leslie Sansome ""Two-mile Walk"" video I already own. I'm middle-aged and overweight, but I found this video not only too easy, but not very interesting to use. An excercise tape has to hold up to hundreds of uses without becoming mind-numbingly boring, and this one doesn't cut it. But if, like me, you aren't in very good shape and not very coordinated, you'll probably like Leslie Sansome's ""Two-mile Walk."" It's more attractive (a mural in the background of a serene harbor gives you something to look at the zillionth time you go through the tape), and a little more fun. By showing a gauge on screen of how far you've walked by doing the tape, you also get a sense of progress and a desire to make it to the next milestone. I will definitely try other Leslie Sansome video tapes, though, because I like her friendly and encouraging screen presence very much, and appreciate the way she gives advance warning when she changes steps."
5,Great Ink,Epson inks have been really good for me ever since I bought my first Epson printer 4 years ago. I have never had a cartridge go out on me. The ink quality is comparable to those from HP if not better. I would recommend that you stick with Epson ink and not use the other ink. The quality and ease of use is just not there. Overall a great product.
1,Full of flaws,"The data in this book is filled with errors, from dates to biographies. It has too many flaws to be considered a good reference source. A few examples; Ailsby states that Richard Glücks, the infamous inspector of the concentration camps made some sort of spectacular escape, in true life, Glücks killed himself in British captivity. Ailsby also states that Herbert Kappler (the head of the Gestapo in Rome) escaped from his prison cell in the -80s and has not been seen after that. And again Ailsby has got it all wrong. Kappler escaped in -77 and died of cancer in -78 in Germany.It seems that Ailsby's primary source on the Knight's Cross winners was Jost Schneider's ""Their Honour Was Loyalty"" that is clear from the way he copies Schneider's text.So my advice is that keep away from this rotten apple."
1,Poor,Way to many errors and NO work(S) cited page. Much better authors around. Try Mark Yerger if you want reliable writing.
4,A Good Intro to the men of the SS,"I thought this was a good intro into the men that served in the SS. This book is an alpahbetical breakdown of the men, and some women, who served in different SS units. However, this is not a history of the SS. The book gives a brief (usually about a 1/2 page) bio of each of the members and breaks down what they did, how they came to join the SS, what medals they won, if they were tried after the war, what they did after the war, etc. The book does give a good look at all the differing aspects of the SS such as camp commandants, gauleiters, camp guards, Waffen-SS officers and soldiers, and even foreign ambassadors. This book is a good intro to the people that made up the SS, what they did, and the differing units that made up the SS."
4,A very good starting point,"I agree with the previous reviewer, some people are a little too pedantic for their own good. While Alisby's book does have some flaws vis-a-vis dates and supposed fates, if you are researching any particular member of the SS then this book, would be a good place to start. As any good researcher will tell you, you should cross-referencing any material with multiple sources and any flaws should be shown up.Ailsby does a fine job of given a precis of all the various branches of the SS. He covers the most nortorious members such as Himmler, Heydrich, Eichmann and Eicke and some of the more well-known members such as Dietrich, 'Panzer' Meyer, and Hausser. But there are also hundreds of bio's for members that I've never heard or read about (surprising given some of the crimes they were guilty off).This book acts as another piece to the jigsaw that is the SS and should not be overlooked."
2,A Disappointment,I was very disappointed after reading this book. It took to long to get to the point and the love story had no love. Elly is manipulated into getting married to Gavan. A man who she doesn't even like. Elly is still in love with her childhood sweetheart and when Gavan finds out he rapes her and leaves for two months. The whole book he is always gone and when he is there they always fight. Until the end when she finally sees that she is in love with Gavan and not her childhood sweetheart.... but how you can fall in love with someone who you can't stand is beyond me...
3,Not as good as the first.,"This album is not as good as the first, most of the songs are more mellow and slower, but that does'nt make them bad. what makes them bad is they are just plain boring, with boring melodies.""It's Been So Long"" is a really good song, and I like ""Freaks in Uniforms"" and ""Hit n' Run"" aswell. It's too bad as the album progresses it gets more and more boring.If you liked Horrorpops first album, there's a strong possibility you'll dig at least a couple of these songs, but don't buy it without hearing some, if not all, of it first"
3,Surprised people are slamming this album,"I think it's a very good album. A few of the songs are ho-hum, but the majority are a fantastic lot of fun. Perhaps that's because I heard of this album before Hell Yeah. I'll have to go back and try Hell Yeah again. I like them both."
2,Not as good as the first but still awesome!,"While I think the last album was better overall, this CD does have some pretty awesome tracks. I honestly only disliked about three songs off this album and think that is more than worth your money."
2,not NEARLY as good as the first album,"This album was way dissappointing. I love the HorrorPops but this is just like the same ballad over and over. If they took like a few of these songs and put them on an album it might be alright, but it's just boring and repetetive. The songs just really aren't well written."
2,a bit of a step down...,"I always tell people I don't like punk music, and aside from one or two exceptions (Misfits, Social D, a couple others), that's true. But i LOVE psychobilly music, and it's closely related to punk in alot of ways.which brings me to the Horrorpops sophmore effort. I was a huge fan of ""Hell Yeah!"", since it combined alot of elements - punk, old fifties love songs, rockabilly, etc. with plenty pure fun and enthusiasm. I expected, then, big things from this second release ""Bring It On!"" and was sadly disappointed.Because it seems like much of the energy is gone, or they just weren't trying as hard. Many of the songs here are just plain punky-stuff, with generic ""whoa"" chorus, et cetera. Too many of the songs are downers, about breakups and being pissed off, and I think this lost a lot of the fun vibe the first release had. There are still a couple of tracks I really liked, like'Walk Like A Zombie' and 'S.O.B.' But the rest I thought was just too plain."
2,Hell No!,"This is not as good as Hell Yeah! I think that when you hear this the Geoff Kresge influence is being heard. It is watered down. I have heard that he wrote alot of this disc and I guess it shows. I have also read in interviews that they want to be known as a 'rock' band and not a 'psychobilly' band. Well, they pulled it off. If they want to try and get on the radio (and there is nothing wrong with that), this is the sound to go for. Best of luck to them, but this disc did not do much for me. Listen to hell yeah first."
3,Out of step,"Guinness, Greene, and Reed, but for all that, this film never seems to find the right tone: not funny enough to be comedy nor dramatic enough to be drama, OUR MAN IN HAVANA is most interesting for the disconcertingly un-typical and out-of-step performances it exacts from Alec Guinness, Burl Ives, and Ernie Kovacs, and for its frozen portrait of Cuba before the revolution."
2,Unconvincing,"Two of three of us watching stayed with it, but it was uncomfortable. Only toward the latter part was it remotely convincing.There, despite all the rest, something of the desperation and conflict that ought to have been ongoing elements began to be felt, . This movie is as awful as its American counterparts from the same era. I could imagine what it might have been, with the same screenplay, in entirely different hands, but only just .Perhaps I should give one star, since some of the casting was so awkward. The constant nudge-nudge theme of ""these spies are all probably homosexuals"" was annoying as well, though that may have been one of the author's notions just being played out continually."
1,Our Man in Havana,What a bore. Don't waste your time or money on this sad movie. I can't believe this was remade years later. I wish I could get my money back!
3,The Old Master at play,"This is a pretty good representation of the book. Alec Guinness is of course excellent -- girl playing Milly OK but really too old for the part. All the others fine. It is a delightful satire on the Cold War spying racket, just before the 'fall' or liberation of Cuba in 1958."
5,The Boosh is loose!,"Earlier work before the T.V. Series recorded for BBC radio. Contains favorite charaters including Bob Fossil, Bollo, Polar Bear, Evil Cockney and of course Vince Noir and Howard Moon. A must for any Mighty Boosh fan."
4,Better!,"I've been a hard core early SP fan for years. I think David Hinds in an amazing songwriter, arranger, and performer. Their first five recordings (Tribute, Handsworth, Reggae Fever, True Democracy, and Earth Crisis) are a must in any reggae collection. Their latest efforts have been less than average. Bad synths, drum machine, pop driven crap that I've always felt was anti-reggae. I was pleasantly surprised when I picked up African Holocaust. You can definitely feel the vibe of old Steel Pulse in most of the songs. There's some pop stuff in there but the recording as a whole is worth listening to. What's the deal with synths and drum machines in reggae anyway???"
1,yeech and double-yeech!,"Is this the dumbest movie ever made? No, that dubious distinction would have to go to ""Superman III,"" with Richard Pryor.However, this film cetainly gives that one a run for its money, so unbelievably dumb, poorly directed, atrociously acted, idiotically scripted, and inanely conceived is it.The only good thing I can manage to say about this thing is that the production actually did pack up and head out to a real desert to film it, so the setting at least comes across as visually convincing."
4,The Bone Snatcher,The movie starts a little slow but soon picks up and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Rachel Shelley fans will love her performance.
3,Not bad!,"Renting this from Blockbuster I had pretty low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie isn't half-bad and in fact has a charm all its own.I loved the sandy desert locale for this piece and felt genuinely creeped out by the isolation. Yeah, we've seen this storyline before but this perspective made for an interesting viewing.The ""Bone-Snatcher"" looked pretty gnarley when he finally comes to light. The CGI wasn't too bad given the low-budget of the film. All other technical aspects of the film are all up to par and the acting is fairly decent for the most part.While at times this movie is a bit hokey (that might be an understatement), it's still very entertaining and worth a rent."
3,Good Story,"This was a fair movie with good camera action and fairly good acting. It seemed to be lacking something, however. Not a great movie, but not a terrible one, either. Don't spend a lot for this one."
3,Bone voyage,A couple of diamond prospectors are tapping around on hard places when one actually caves in. Naturally he has to look inside and you can guess who disappears.Mean time Dr. Zack Straker (Scott Bairstow) shows up and has fun learning the culture and different quirks of the employees of a local mine consortium.They run into the empty pit and signs of the missing prospectors. We also are reminded that on Zack arrival we see a mysterious native with a strange fetish. Evidently there is more to the story than some missing people. To add to the mix is the beautiful Mikki (Rachel Shelley) to add to the potential love angle.There may be something ancient that snatches bones for nefarious purposes or is it all one big bugaboo?
2,"Okay, but not scary","I thought from the reviews that this movie would be better than it was. It looks like a movie that was made for the Sci Fi Channel. It's okay if your flipping through channels for something to watch, but I wouldn't spend money on it. It's not scary or even tense. I think the person who wrote wow must have been in the movie or had a friend in it. I don't see anyway anyone could watch this movie and say wow. I try to see every horror film I can. I don't scare very easy, but I don't think even a child would be scared by this one."
3,Falls short,"As every horror film out there today, it needs a cool cover to suck the viewer in. Most of the time the movie is bad and rarely you'll find a gem among the bunch. This movie had a great trailer and it made me really want to view this film. Anyway, the movie is slow paced and nothing really happens within the first half hour. I really enjoyed the monster and it could have been better used in this film. The ending was perfect until they had to show the monsters beating heart as if too say like it or not, a sequel may come out. I'd welcome a sequel with more of the monster."
4,Scholarship for the public,"Quality study of the original Aramaic ""Lord's Prayer."" Very readable and useful in group study. Accommodates conservative theology."
5,An Excellent Book with a Different Perspective,"The title is a little offputting, but it turns out to be more of a metaphor than literal. The book contains a lot of excellent writing and food for thought. I would recommend it to those who want to go a little beyond standard Christian-type books."
5,Setting a Trap for God,Setting A Trap for GodIt is excellent and gives great depth to the meaning of getting ready to receive God's messages.
4,Loved loved loved!,"I may be biased because this was the first historical I ever read but there was so much to love about this book! The characters were so believable and well-developed, the intimacy was hottt, and after the first 50 or so pages the plot was beautiful! One of the most beautiful endings in a book (I actually remember it line for line). Only drawbacks: the slow start (...or maybe I was just impatient) and the story with the brother was kind of thrown in. But great read! My copy is well-thumbed through and now the front cover is missing. It was such a memorable book!"
3,Nice box... questionable quality bits,"I got this as my first router bit set for a new Porter-Cable hand router. I knew by the price I shouldn't expect this to be super quality, but I had less than 2 hours of work with the 1/4"" straight bit when it snapped on me. not happy. This set has a lot of bits, and will be OK for very light duty, but I went ahead and picked up a quality 1/2"" shank set - fewer bits, more expensive, but should last longer."
3,No problems...yet.,"I bought this same router bit set over 2 years ago from Sportsman's [...] for around $25.00 on sale. Most of what I buy and do is constrained by a limited budget and these bits where very inexpensive compared to others. I have only used the roundover bits and the 1/2"" straight bit on MDF board.Reading some of these reviews makes me nervous to use the bits on any wood product harder than pine for fear of having a flying bit from breakage. I have made MDF bookshelves and loudspeaker cases with relative ease but plan to do some projects using pine and oak.I think I will buy some better quality straight bits and roundover bits for harder woods before I start my new projects just to be safe!"
4,Good buy for the price,For the price you get a good assortment of bits. The quality is standard for this price range. A good buy all in all.
5,Beautiful Eyelet Baby Bassinet Set,Looks really nice on the Bassinet! The three-tier eyelet is absolutely beautiful on a new or old bassinet. I would highly recommend it.
3,"Great movie, but awful sound!","The movie is a classic, Paul Kersey as the vigilante. I was very disappointed with the sound quality on the DVD. The VHS copy had better sound. It had a good picture, but the sound could have been much better."
3,"Not Playing ""All Regions""","This was a gift for my brother in Germany and I made sure that the dvd had no region limitations. However, once out of the box and in the dvd player in Germany it did not play. It does play in the States.The delivery time and quality of the dvd was excellent, albeit not in the intendet region."
5,Replacement,Liked it 20 years ago and like it now. I lost my original(loaned it out one too many times). This is a replacement.
5,Deathwish with Charles Bronson,This a great movie and it completes the whole series of the deathwish series Charles did.
5,bronson kicks butt!!go buy his movies!!,Charles Bronson is my favorite actor of all time and the death wish series is no exception.its facinating to see how he fights the bad guys and takes matter into his own hands!all bronson movies are action pack with suspense and the death wish series are the best!charles bronson is no longer with us but he left an extraordinary legacy of movies for all to enjoy!hopefully in death he can reunite with Jill Ireland his beloved wife!!
5,WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS?,"I KNOW WHAT I'D DO. AND IT'D BE THE SAME THING THAT MADE THIS FILM CONTROVERSIAL. IN THIS CLASSIC TALE, A NEW YORKER [CHARLES BRONSON AT HIS UNDENIABLE BEST] FINDS OUT HIS WIFE IS KILLED AND RAPED AND HIS DAUGHTER IS RAPED BY MUGGERS. OUT OF OUTRAGE, HE DECIDES TO GO ON A ONE MAN VIGILANTE RAMPAGE. THIS VIOLENT ACTIONER IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTION FILMS OF ALL TIME. IT HAS EVERYTHING: GREAT ACTION, A GOOD STORY, GOOD ACTING, AND AN ANTICIPATED ENDING. IF YOU'RE INTO ACTION FILMS OR IF YOU JUST LIKE CHARLES BRONSON, YOU'LL BE IMMEDIATELY SATISFIED ONCE YOU SEE THIS CLASSIC FILM. FOLLOWED BY FOUR NEEDLESS AND INFERIOR SEQUELS."
4,Charles Bronson is superb...,"This is the third freaking time I've written a review for this tape and this is the last one I'm concocting. What can be said about DEATH WISH? Well, a lot more would be said if submitted reviews were posted. OKAY, it's a revenge PLOT! But the very best ever and Alan Ladd can't hold a candle to Chuck! This film has much violence, some rape, and nudity. Enjoy Bronson's mannered but effective performance."
5,I love me some charlie Bronson!,"Look, we all know the human soul lusts for vengeance, and that revenge is the best feeling in the world. Add in a healthy dose of early 1970-'s NYC filth, the great Vincent Gardenia , plus Stuart Margolin (that guy angel from the Rockford files ), and even what I think is the first movie role for Christopher Guest (spinal-tap, mighty wind, etc).I literally watch this movie 15 times a year, whenever I am feeling blue it picks me up to see scum blown away."
4,Good product,"To often dvds are poorly reproduced which takes away from the viewing experience. This dvd was not not one of those products. The movie was displayed as intended. Recommend this vendor for a good product. If your a Bronson fan you'll love this movie, I would not show this with children in the room but I enjoy the acting and the premise of the movie."
1,If you like being manipulated- this is your movie!,"I remember this film from my youth as being a great movie, and people cheering in the theatre as the plot unfolded. However, the intervening years have changed my opinion.One of the greatest disservices it does is portray New York City as a uniform cesspool of unchecked crime. It is illogical that Paul Kersey's family would live in a part of town where street thugs would so brazenly roam. And, although it does make an attempt to show why Kersey, the man of peace, turns into the avenger, it takes place too swiftly.Otherwise, this movie is talky, has LOUSY and irrelevant music, spends a great deal of time in digression, and is unrealistically resolved. The DVD I viewed was a terrible transfer too, but this might not apply to the one being sold here.I was more than disappointed."
2,"Despite dark(and timely)black humor, a crass exploiter","Charles Bronson is realistically nervous taking on NYC's muggers, robbers and assailants after the murder of his wife, but what was once a shocking expose of big city crime and ruthlessness now merely looks ugly and sad, with only detective Vincent Gardenia's pungent asides to give the film a little humanity. Bronson can't seem to go for a walk without a vicious thug picking him out, and while the film isn't very dated, it is over-the-top in its cheap nastiness. The brackish color and dawdling pace are other handicaps that make the whole queasy enterprise slightly stultifying."
2,Ahh....,"Okay for the seventies I guess, considering I wasn't even born during this film's release. I am not a Charles Bronson fan because all of his films seem to be one Death Wish after the other ( and I don't mean the actual sequels ). Charles was believable in the role but the movie got stupid when he started whacking muggers on the street. It was as if we were supposed to believe he'd snapped because of his daughter and wife's tragic situation, but the film never showed him progressing into that sort of state. At one moment he was dealing with his wife's death and his daughter's rape, the next he was killing folks, but he still ACTED as normal as he was before. I didn't think the writing or the direction was done very well, but for Charles Bronson fans, it scores. I was impressed by Jeff Goldblum most of all. He wasn't on screen long but he left a lasting impact. Jeff was fabulous as a rapist and great in his first role."
2,Can we say: o-v-e-r-r-a-t-e-d?,"Classic movie my white behind! More like possible camp classic, but in actuality not quite incompetant enough for that. This is simply a stinky movie that has aged worse than limburger (which I happen to quite like, if it's fresh and very thinly sliced - which my local deli does acceptably well). Charles Bronson, may he rest in peace, was indeed a screen legend but his acting abilities were limited... to one facial expression. The dubbing on this movie makes it seem almost like a foreign flick, albeit without any kickbutt kung-fu action! The ""villians"" (among them young Jeff Goldbum) are laughable and very nearly something out of a Troma movie. I will not examine the ""feminist"" or ""neo-femme"" implications of this movie, because it was made in a (thankfully) bygone era when such concerns did not generally surface in Hollywood productions. But it is safe to say this film is a relic best approached as a mild comedy."
2,I'm not really a movie fan,I bought it as a gift for somebody that likes movies. I don't watch things about blood and death and all of that.
5,vhs movies & dvd movies,"Everthing worked out fine, I was well pleased with all transactions.Thanks,Willie Lewis"
5,Rooting for Bronson!,"If you're a fan of urban adventure..., the worst of the bad guys doing horrible things to innocent people..., cops unable to stop them..., and a vigilante stepping in to save us all, BUY THIS MOVIE! Don't look for an Oscar winning performance, just a lot of action, and a lot of fun. You'll find yourself pulling it out on a winter afternoon, and enjoying it over and over."
4,Death Wish,Death Wish is a somewhat dated 1974 crime/action drama. It started the Death Wish series in which four sequels were made. It's hard to imagine anyone else but Charles Bronson playing Paul Kersey. The murdering punks are played in an unbelievable fashion. Michael Winner's directing style is not my favorite to be honest but the film still works. I can only imagine what watching this film in theaters would have been like in 1974.
3,IS IT JUST MY IMAGINATION...,"... or were certain scenes edited from this DVD version just like Paramount did with ""Thief Of Hearts""? I could have sworn the rape scene was originally longer and more graphic."
4,A Very Underrated Album,"I think this is the best album the Saint ever made. It is easily better than their debut. The sound is great, complements of Max Norman I believe (Diary of a Madman and other classics). The cover is kind of cool too. My favs have always been Nervous Man, For The Sake, and Aftermath! Dave Prichard was a great guitarist and he deserved more recognition than he got. He was the heart of the band and when he passed away in 1990 (leukemia) the band was never the same. But it's cool that they are still going with John Bush coming back when he has time. I give this album 4.5 Stars. Get it and crank it!!"
5,Masterful songwriting and production.,"This is the best Pat Benatar CD. She and Neil Geraldo her husband-guitarist-songwriter-producer are on top of their game.The guitar work on this one is clearly amazing. If you like U2 Joshua Tree you will love the same type of sophisticated guitar delay repeat, tasteful beautiful melodic keyboards harmonizations/textures and most of all just great songs one after another. In the vocal dept Pat Benatar delivers passionate strong emotional performances song after song. This cd is what ""Raised on Radio"" is to Journey, underrated but clearly the best cd of the band."
5,great straight-ahead jazz,"An excellent session. The saxophonist is backed by Cedar Walton (piano), Bryan Carrott (vibes), David Williams (bass), Kenny Washington (d). ""For Stanley"" is a tribute to another great sax player the late Stanley Turrentine. Newman is a soulful saxophonist. Listen to his pure singing tone on ""Cristo redentor"" (alto) and ""Davey blue"" (tenor)."
1,This is music ?,"I absolutely disliked this CD. These songs have no rythm,no beat, and no tempo. Definitely not recommended."
5,Sinbad,Excellent quality. Was looking for this dvd for over a year. Love old movies as well as current ones!! Would buy again from this company.
3,Unintentionally amusing,"Leonard Maltin says that this is a tongue in cheek adventure flick. I think you could enjoy it today if you were, say twelve years old or younger. For more mature viewers, the film can be an unintentional howl. The overacting by Fairbanks is a hoot. Maureen O'Hara as a smouldering Moslem woman is hilarious. George Tobias, as the comic sidekick, is simply pathetic. Anthony Quinn as a heinous Arab villain and Walter Slezak as an Asian are ludicrous. In short, a lot of fun for juveniles and the sophisticated film goer."
1,Great Sinbad Story. Extremely poor video quality.,"I purchased this VHS tape because of the bad reviews of the DVD available on Amazon.But this VHS is an awful rip-off with very poor video quality. It even uses a cheap color xerox of the original VIC box artwork used as a slide in sheet for the cover of the box. The artwork on the front of the box even cuts off some of the VIC logo and the back has unreadable grainy text.Distributor on box front = Video International Corp., [...] on back, but the tape plays as Video Entertainment Corp. as distributor.Amazon lists this as the January 1st, 1985 release, VHS tape. However it says on the back of the box, artwork copyright 2007.It played like a copy of a copy of a copied tape. I returned it to Amazon.Later I bought a used copy of the original 1986 RKO release and the 1986 Turner release on VHS. Both are excellent! (The RKO version seemed a little sharper and brighter of these two fine VHS tapes.)"
3,The Perfect Touch Of ... Dumbness,"Jeff makes A comeback! This CD is Very, Very Funny. But, it is made FOR 18+ There are some things The ""Children"" Might Not UnderStand. Exsample: #6 ""The Fetility Clinic"" Over all, very funny. With the apporite ""Age"""
2,Not Worth The Price,"I wish I would have known the content of this book before I spent $17.99 for it. Its a simple book, with simple pictures.Good information, but not worth the money."
1,Only 1 package and hot pink,"This indicates that you will be getting two of the tampon purse holders, and that one will be grey & pink and the other will be grey & lavender. Instead I received ONE hot pink holder. The holder does say it will hold two tampons, but I expected a set of two individually packaged items. Also, the color I received was not what was promised and will not blend in to other stuff in my purse- it screams: ""LOOK AT ME!"" If you are hoping for something subdued, don't count on this product."
5,My son loves this!!,"My 4 yr. old loves this bike!! Amazon offers the lowest price on it as well!! Would highly recommend, especially if they love superman!"
2,Weak.,"Any game that relies heavily on saving and replaying until you don't die in that last 10 seconds is weak, and needed more game play testing time. Doom 3 was fun, this follow up game is not worth your time, and should never have made it out the door. I'm annoyed I bought it used for $5.00, that's how bad it is."
2,DOOM 3 v.s DOOM ROE,"Short and sweet,am i talking about the game or my review..???BOTH.....plezzzzz just trust us get DOOM 3 it sounds better looks better and is longer and a bit more creepy....Have fun with either one you buy.....shoot ya L8R....DOOM 3 4.5* OUT OF 5* DOOM ROE 3.0* OUT OF 5*.....WELL HAVE FUN:-) Just go play socom 3.....on the ps2 or HALO 2 on the Box......Ragman..."
4,Doom 3 Review :D,Well it was a cool game...nothing was wrong..except for the graphics. It should've been pushed to the limits of the xbox engine even tho i played it on the 360 console. Nonetheless it's a great game i loved it..but more enjoyed playing it at night for it is a creepy game!
5,Doomed!!!!,"BIG WOW!!!This game is a blast, it's fun, plays great and as a bonus, when played on the XBOX 360, it has DOOM, DOOM2 and more.A very pleasant surprise!Enjoy."
5,Band-Aid Covers The Bullet Hole,"I love this CD. Scarling. are absolute sonic bliss. ""Scarling. sounds like being French kissed by the most beautiful beings in the world, and then being unable to stop the bleeding. Really alluring yet massive stuff."" - Alternative Press .... SO TRUE!"
3,Disappointing...,"Well its basicly the same as the 7 inch with better sound, a slightly modified version of Band aid covers the bullet hole and a poor cover of Radiohead's Creep...if you own the 7 inch, save your money for the full album. If you dont, by all means, get it. The artwork alone is worth it.I just wish they released a cd single right from the start and put the time and money into a full album..."
1,NEVER GOT IT TO RUN!,"I cannot tell how great this item might have been... it certainly was presented as a great chess resource and game and I think it has a great reputation. Unfortunately, I could never get it to run on a brand new DELL computer or any other computer I tried to install it on... these computers were new computers with windows 2000 on them... maybe that is the problem since 5500 runs on win95/98. It would be reasonable to expect that it would also run on more current versions... but it does not..."
3,Good,"This is one of those books where you like some stories, and dislike others. I greatly enjoyed the story ""Linnea"" by D. J. Malcolm. My suggestion for this book (and all other books ever written for that matter), is to check it out from the library to read it first, before you buy it. I'm not saying that this is a bad book, but it's always good to check first! Anyway, I have a question for all of you: Does anyone know if D.J. Malcolm has a website? Is there a list of books he has written? And how can I contact him? Just checking!"
4,DC210 Plus - a great inexpensive digital camera!,"I purchased this camera for two reasons a) to save money on film and development cost and b) to support several imaging related projects I'm working on - namely a picture CD, printing and framing photos, digital collages, etc. For the money spent (~$450 after add-ons) it was well worth it. The image quality is great, and the pixel density is good enough for a decent 5x7. On the down side, PC transfer is pretty slow - about 45 seconds per image on the highest quality and size. Also, the picture is ideal when the subject is relatively close - like between 4 and 20 feet. Beyond that the results are not optimal. Overall I'd say if you want a digital point and shoot camera to replace your film camera, this is the one. If you are an amateur photographer, go for a DC260 or DC295."
4,dc-210 worth a look,"As digital cameras with better resolution appear, the Kodak DC-210 seems perhaps outdated. But it is not. For pictures to insert into web pages, it is perfect. The DC-210 has a large LCD for viewing photos, and a two to one optical zoom lens. Using CF memory, getting pictures from the camera to your computer is very easy. It even works on my Amiga 3000. If there is any problem with the camera, it is the short battery life. You will go through a lot of AA alkalines if you use the LCD much, but that is not a serious problem. Just don't pay a whole lot for the DC-210, as new cameras in the 1.1 megapixel class are now under $100."
1,"Slow, Fragile, Slow","I guess I expected more from Kodak. This camera takes a long time to turn on, a long time between pictures, and a long time to transfer pictures. Picture quality was adequate. Wouldn't work in the cold, and stopped working all toghether shortly after the warranty ran out. Not recommended."
1,So Where's The Replacements?,"Okay...so I know nothing about these bands but no mention of the Replacements; whose song ""Bastards of Young"" this dvd takes it's name from?! What do the words of this song have anything to do with this year's crop of musicians? It's a great phrase and it could reasonably be said that the lyrics might speak for any generation of rock and roll, but I'd counter that every generation ought to write their own goddamn song. Not take up the banner of one that was written before most of them were born. It insults me, it insults them, and the creators of this...whatever...suck for not coming up with one ounce of originality on their own. They're as crappy as Kenny G and should retire."
4,A rare and undderated 80's gem.,"Sinead O'Connor covered ""A Monkey In Winter"" later in the 80's. I owned this album on cassette and bid high for a CD copy on Ebay. The lyrics are haunting and clever. The music was edgier and more progressive than 80's bands of the day. If you ever liked this band's other hits, this was the lost gem before they broke up. So glad to find this to download singles. I recommend ""confession""."
1,"Got nothiing to review, not yet received?",I have sent queries through to establish why I have yet to receive my items ordered. This is now a week and a half passed the estimated delivery date! When can I expect delivery?
1,Great Id - too bad it doesn't work,"We were really excited about this when we bought it for our children. The first one we had, we could not get the blue light on. We tried every possible way to get the batteries in - no matter what the combination - the blue light would not light up or blink. So, we took it back to return it and picked up another one. This one's light would blink. We were hopefull. Unfortunately, after over a dozen attemps including multiple TVs and even the audio CD - the unit would not configure - the light kept on blinking. So, we're taking this back and not going to try another. A cool idea and it would be the greatest if it actually worked. I can only assume that the quality tanked because of trying to meet holiday production."
4,Very entertaining and great way to learn,"We got this toy as a gift. My twin girls are 13 months and they both love this toy. Bath time has always been tiring for me because they both like to play ""catch me if you can"" during dress up. Ever since I had this toy my girls will just stay put watching the show while I dress them up. The blue light doesn't bother them, they actually got curious that they always press it. They learn how to say hello and bye bye and they laughed during peek a boo time then they start playing peek a boo with us even without the toy. I highly recommend it."
3,Pretty Boring,"I bought this game on July 16th for my daughter for her 7th birthday. She absolutely loved it for the first two days, and hasn't played it since. She said it's boring and just goes on and on. It wasn't worth the $20 spent for it. I tried to give it to a friends daughter who is 8. She played it for an hour and gave it back. Same thing, she said ""how boring"". Don't waste your money."
3,Simple item with an enormous cost !!!,"The printer is excellent, but the supplies are extremely expensive. That's why non-original products are selling so well."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FROM IMAPRINT Nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!,I'd like to know if anyone else out there was ripped by a company named Imaprint? They sold me 6 ink cartridges. All of them were dried up. I contacted the company and they said to send them back. That was in Dec. of 2003 I have not heard from them yet. I mailed them by using the US mail service and used Delivery Confirmation. They signed for it and that was it. Also I contacted Amazon and they were of no help to me at all.
4,ink jet,"the ink works fine though is a pain to make the printer work perfectly since is quite old, besides that it prints smoothly no problems,"
1,"black ink do not fit. i chech part #, but do not fit.","I ORDERED COLOR/ BLACK INK. I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON BLACK INK, IT CAME TODAY, I TRIED LOADING MY INK, NOT THE CORRECT SIZE, BOTH INK INCORRECT PART# IS OKAY, BUT WRONG SIZE. I AM SO UPSET."
2,"Quality product, but overpriced","Epson's ink has always worked fine in my Epson Stylus 640. If only it weren't so expensive. I just ordered cartridges from a third-party manufacturer; four black and two color cartridges and a head cleaning kit for the price of one black and one color cartridge from Epson. If the third-party ink doesn't perform, I'll replace my printer with another brand."
2,Don't buy this cartridge.,The printer works pretty well for an economy model but one of these cartridges prints at most 50 pages. That is about 40 cents per page for the ink; I will never buy Epson again!!
3,Satisfactory but an Expense,"This is a satisfactory product. The cartridge was initially hard to find, many times out of stock, and it's over priced. More recently, it is available, but it remains darned expensive. There are other brands that fit that could save you a few dollars. The educated consumer might want to shop around and try the generics before getting stuck over paying Epson again and again."
5,"good product, excellent service",Although a bit oldfashioned a very good exercise book for those who have learned the basics of the hindi language in an intermediate level
3,OK product--nothing special though,"I bought this awhile ago, while on a quest for a really good, light, tinted moisturizer. The product is fine, but frankly not notably different from far less expensive rpoducts form mainstream brands. I am now using the Chanel one, and I like that one a great deal."
1,Expensive and not particularly tasty,"In addition to paying a lot for this product, you also have to buy unsweetened baking chocolate and heavy cream. I was assuming that these products only required perishable items, like cream or eggs, but baking chocolate too? It should at least taste decent, but it needs more sweetener. The texture isn't the greatest either. I ended up throwing the whole thing away."
1,What the Fudge?,"I agree with the above poster. I should have read more closely, granted, but I spent a good amount at Whole Foods for the additional ingredients. It didn't take that long to make, but five hours later (it says only 1-2 hours to set) it tasted like a whole mouth full of weak-chocolate toothpaste. Just one bite made me feel sick, so I tossed the rest out. Not worth the unnecessary deviation from my diet. If you're craving fudge on a lo carb diet, just go get a piece of chocolate and indulge for the moment. Short cuts are not worth it."
3,Pretty Standard Stuff,"I'm glad this is in print, but it's far from being Ra's best work from this time frame. This is a fairly traditional album that will have more appeal for middle-of-the-road jazz consumers than for Ra's usual target audience. All in all a very ""normal"" album."
1,"Only after a year, the sidewall SPLIT!","After less than a year of owning these tires, I noticed that my front tire sidewall split resulting in a flat. I've always taken well care of my tires, proper tire pressure and never ran over anything that would result in such damage to the sidewall. Do you research on these tires, they are know to split on the sidewall for NO reason at all. I contacted Panaracer (Panasonic) and they said that they would do nothing besides forwarding my complaint to Japan. They said that the split was a result of something cutting the tire but as you will see in the picture, it is not a cut but a pulling of the fibers away from the webbing. BEWARE for you own safety. DO NOT PURCHASE PANARACER series tires. I'll post a picture of the split."
1,Boring Film,"After hearing how great this film was, I thought I would see for myself if it could hold up to the standard. What a waste of time, this is an incomplete film that invests no interest for an educated viewer. The French do not know how to entertain us, they are overtly too serious and pompous. In my opinion, the film is quite over-rated and Luis Bunuel does a better job at attacking the upper-classes and he makes us laugh as well. Grade: F"
1,"Great, but Overpriced","The Rules of the Game is a Great Film. Unfortunately it is being put out by Criterion and is overpriced. When you can get any other DVD that comes out on sale for $14.99 or $19.99, you'll have to shell out $27.97 to Criterion for Rules of the Game.I've heard the justifications before -- Criterion's transfers are the best and their added features are of the highest quality. This is true, and back in the days of laserdiscs and the early days of DVDs it made a difference. With the DVD craze in full fury, too many DVDs are being published today with the same care that Criterion puts in, but at a significantly lower price. Criterion is stuck in the past.Which is too bad, because the only way you can get The Rules of the Game and similar classic films is to pay Criterion's exorbitent prices. In a way, Criterion is holding these movies for ransom. A price I'm not willing to pay."
5,Must watch,"The best movie I've seen in a long time. There are different perceptions. Here is mine.This is a movie about relationships, how they develop and how they break. Its about the joy and agony and above all the 'confusion' of love. Set up in an aristocratic French society, it portrays game hunting which is pretty symbolic. The game has no rules, people can kill as many rabbits or pheasants they wish but have to stop somewhere to make sure enough game is left so that the gamekeeper has a job. Similarly,in love, people can fall in love with as many people as they want but should stop somewhere so that love exists. Too much love can result in too many things going wrong which prevents love itself like in this case, aviator Andre......ok dont worry, I'll keep myself from narrating the movie.......its for you to find out..the rules of the game."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A film often found in critics' alltime-best lists, The Rules of the Game may be a bit too slowly paced for the average filmgoer but it offers a wealth of drama and incisive satire for the more patient viewer: it's a must-watch for cinephiles, but casual film fans might do better to look elsewhere."
3,for the Blu-ray,"- five stars for the film. This is a disappointing blu-ray release from the normally exemplary Criterion. What we have here is the 1959 reconstruction of the film conservatively cleaned up. But the fact is, the 1959 reconstruction is in need of some very up to date digital restoration. This would be a major job and Criterion has not attempted it. One obvious example: the 1959 reconstruction was assembled from multiple prints, since the original camera negative was apparently destroyed. So there are many variations in brightness and contrast. These could be evened out with a digital restoration.Although this blu-ray is certainly the best version available at present for home viewing, a side by side comparison on a 42"" monitor showed barely perceptible differences from the 2004 Criterion issue. An upgrade to the blu-ray is recommended only if you have a 60""+ HDTV or a DLP projector.Let's hope some financing can be found soon for a true, state of the art digital restoration."
2,Short review of the bfi (UK) DVD,"Always nice to have lots of reviews attached to a DVD when all of them in fact review a completely different DVD :-)So here's a very short review of the bfi DVD (UK, PAL): The image quality is fine, but the English subtitles are burnt into the picture, which is a no-go. So it's impossible to recommend this DVD; better get the Criterion one instead."
5,Useful!,"I was a little worried since it took a long time and lots of hard exercise to get to the point where I just barely passed muster on the qualifying fitness charts in pushups, situps and run time. Also, everyone whom I've asked about Basic training won't give me any tips other than ""Have a strong sense of humor,"" and ""Shut up, follow orders. Do nothing more than that and you'll be fine."" I wasn't satisfied with that.I read through this guidebook once, and I've found out that I haven't been working out efficiently in regards to making good scores. I'm also relieved to know that someone will be at MEPS to hold my ankles, since I could only knock out 3 situps without anchoring my feet onto something. The tips and tricks to things like eating, getting dressed, and especially getting respect are the answers that I needed, but didn't think about. I felt that I had spent my money well."
5,amazing...,This book was packed with info that will benefit anyone interested in going into the militry. My hubby went through boot camp a few years ago and said that all of the info would have made life a little easier then...lol.
3,I didn't learn as much as I had hoped,"The book is indeed full of information that many people may not know, but a lot of it, if not all of it, can be found online. I had been researching the Army for a long time before discovering this book, but I still wanted to try it out, hoping I would learn even more. I discovered that between blogs, articles, recruiters, and conversations with other soldiers, I had managed to absorb all the stuff that the book talked about.That being said, it is a lot easier to have it all combined in one easy location. It saves time for sure. So I definitely recommend this book for those just starting to look into the Army; it's easy to read and understand, and it has some pictures and charts to give visual descriptions. If you're research-savvy, however, then I warn you that you may not be surprised by the information covered. I never had a ""wow, that's very good to know"" moment while reading it."
5,"The Ultimate Basic Training Guidebook: Tips, Tricks, and Tactics for Surviving Boot Camp","My son will go to marine boot camp in July. I read this first and it was a great help for me to understand what will happen and what he needs to do before he goes. I highly recommend this not only for our ""new"" military but for their parents as well."
2,meh...,"This book is rife with spelling/grammer errors and has very little substance. The author managed to blow this title up by writing in 14 sized font and dispersing (laughable) pictures throughout.His advice amounts to ""show up with a 300 PTFT, eat quickly and tell your DIs what they want to hear""The information from this book is readily available on [...] or yahoo - For any Army hopefuls, I'd recommend going there instead or buying this gargabe"
3,Decent Book For Ultra-Noob,"First off, there are many inaccuracies in this book which is odd considering it was written by a SGT (sergeant). The book is not as good as it could be but it's better than any other book on the military out there - as far as getting through basic training.Overall, it's a helpful book because it will familiarize you with the Army and basic training. The Army is changing quick so some of the info is not relevant.I'm a veteran of the Army and I think it could be beneficial. I'd recommend talking to recent basic training graduates and ask your recruiter lots of questions. There's also great info on the Army recruiting websites now."
4,Not army boot camp anymore...,"This book has been super helpful in preparing my husband for boot camp- physically and mentally. The only problem is that we've learned that after the publishing of this book a lot changed in army boot camp. At first my husband was interested in joining the national guard, but in order to go to a boot camp like what is described in this book, he has to choose a different branch of military."
4,Exactly what I was lookin for,This book is exactly what you need to get ready for BCT. The workout program is the best I've come across and is the most effective by far. The only real complaint I have is that I wish there were better examples of some of the workouts. Bottom line: this is the best no nonsense preparatory guide for BCT out there.
5,Great guide for anyone on their way to basic training,awesome book that really gives a lot of useful information on life in basic training and how to prepare for it. I highly recommend this to anyone who is going into the military. A. Benavidez
5,A very valuable text,"The fitness program alone is worth every penny I spent on the book.I knew I needed more information on basic, but I could not find the right resources. In this book Mr. Volkin tells you all the information on how to get physically fit, how to avoid extra negative attention from the drill sergeants, acronyms that you will need to memorize, how to eat/dress more efficiently, and more.I would have to say without a doubt that if your thinking about joining the army this guide is for you."
3,I remember this one..,"I saw this 100 years ago (OK - it was 1986) and must have rented it a billion times because of the gymnastics and this is where I was first introduced to the hottie Keanu Reeves.Not very realistic in the gymnastics department but then, no ""gymnastics"" movie ever is. I am going to get it out of nostalgia and will let you know how it holds up nearly 20 years (!) later...."
3,Sound Issue,Was super excited to finally find this movie on DVD one of my favs! The only problem was maybe 15 minutes before the movie ended there was a glitch which seemed to have cause a 2 second lag in the sound... so it was like watching a foreign film. Slightly disappointing.
3,Good Olivia movie. questionable dvd,"I have seen 1.33:1 vhs releases, and 1.77:1 dvd from overseas. I wonder what aspect ratio the dvd's really are listed here. You can't trust amazon's info.Here is the rub.After compareing the vhs and wide dvd, I have determined the aspect ratio of the celuloid negative is about 1.66:1. The wide dvd I have seen was cut on the top and bottom. The vhs is not cut on the top and bottom, but is cut on the sides. So neither is correct.Studio's are releasing most everything 1.77:1 (16x9) which is a compromize between 35mm and 70mm film.I would much rather they release things ""the extact size of the celuloid negative"" Period. When high end dvd players first came out, there was a lot of choices for zooming. 1.2x, 1.4x etc.. This worked well for the odd sized dvd's like ""countess dracula"" which was 1.66:1. Now they just crop everything to 1.77 no matter the size.This ruins films shot in 1.33:1 and 1.66:1."
2,Oh dear...I got ripped buying these.,"The drill bits are, by far, the worst i've ever purchased. At a close glance, they appear to be are poorly machined, and the grade of metal used is too soft for basic drilling applications. The drill bits can easily bend under the slightest pressure, and they have a tendency to randomly wonder around their intended target even on soft materials.Maybe I'm being picky but, I purchased some cheap Ryobe drill bits for six bucks at Home Depot. As I drove home, I marveled as to how something so cheap could be of any use...Wait, I don't even like Ryobe power tools doh!! When I tested them my jaw dropped. They made a super-clean cut without traveling off target or bending out of shape....Wow---six bucks!!I feel terrible for writing this article, but the truth must be told. I believe that Yukon Tools will eventually improve their producs and wish them the best of luck."
2,Not impressed,I bought 3 of these sets for a employee reward program. All three storage cases were defective.
2,better than nothing,"This is easily the most annoying program I've owned. Although it does help once in a while to open the occasional .doc or .ppt file that I receive in e-mail, it makes the process so agonizing it's only slightly better than not opening the file at all. About half the time the file opens up perfectly. The rest of the time the application opens (s-l-o-w-l-y...) then a blank document comes up. It claims to be the file in question, but there is nothing in the document at all. But the same file just might open up fine the next time you start your computer. You never know what you'll get. This happens not only with translated documents, but even with documents created in Thinkfree itself. I recommend it only a stop-gap measure for those who have a lot of time to waste trying to get MS files to open."
1,ThinkFree Office does NOT work on Mac OS X. Period.,"Much like another commentator, I have a Mac and tried this. Oddly, the online version works pretty well on my Mac. So I just straight bought the offline version.Not one single Word or PowerPoint file opened properly. The formatting looks garbled. The powerpoint equivalent (""Show"") wouldn't even correctly render a full menu bar, let alone open anything.Any accolades for this product are for non-Mac versions and/or the online version only.I hate to say it, but one might just have to bite the bullet and buy MS Office. I have boot camp and parallels and just resort to that now. Sucks, I know.Oh, did I make myself clear about how bad this product is? Tech support says that they're aware of a solution and I can beta test in September. Sounds like others have been down this road before.Go ahead...if you've got time to waste."
1,Worst software in 16 years !,"It doesn't work. Period.No response from tech support after 2 inquiries over 10 days.History: it wouldn't open _any_ of my word doc's: tech support advised re-install. [no-brainer, non-responsive advice] Nontheless, I did this TWICE, and it still wouldn't work. Emailed tech again, twice, still no response after 11-12 days. In other words, there is no tech support.I got a trial .v of icWord, and it did everything AND it costs less.[My platform: iBook w/640Mb ram on OS 9.2.]This is first junk software I've had in 16 yrs as a Mac user. There should be a no-star rating for these guys."
2,Not what I expected.,"I didn't like this book at all. The characters became annoying and confusing, and almost totally false (i.e. Mikey leaving her feelings for Shawn out in the open). No girls are like that; I was no where close when I was 13. Many of the subplots become interesting then are suddenly lost (e.g. Margalo's crush on the teacher, Mikey's Secret Admirer- we never find out who it is, though I know who it is). The writing didn't seem as good as Voight's previous works."
5,Great Quality,"This shelf was easy to assemble, the materials are of high quality, and, best of all, it looks great! I would definitely recommend it."
5,Nice narrow shelving,"I needed a shelf system which would not be over 52 inches tall and it had to be narrow. I purchased this item and the accompanyingWinsome Wood Leo Storage Baskets, Set of 2, Espresso. The shelf was perfect for our needs where it would be set back in a little niche in our house. I used the baskets for the bottom 2 shelves and put antique books on the upper shelves."
5,Was worried...but now totally satisfied!,"I read most of the recent reviews on this product prior to purchasing. I also looked around at other websites and stores for a few weeks. I didn't find anything that compared. Now that I have the product I am very satisfied. Yes, when finished assembling by myself, the shelf was a little wobbly. However, the instructions say ""2 person assembly"" and when my husband came home and tightened the screws for me, the unit was NO LONGER WOBBLY. It took me about 30 minutes to fully assemble by myself. Also, the wood is really solid hardwood and very nice looking at that. It is absolutely PERFECT for our newborn son's books and toys while he stays in our bedroom. I would recommend this to anyone; especially for the ""can't be beat"" cost! I've even contemplated buying a second one. We'll see..."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I'm assuming this doesn't happen to everyone, but the holes were drilled into the unit improperly, thusly making the bookshelf impossible to assemble (without drilling new holes). You get what you pay for I guess. I'm returning it tomorrow."
2,Poor quality control,"It stands upright, and all the pieces are intact. Otherwise, the quality was poor: the sides are warped, one shelf is trapezoidal, and the holes were misplaced for one set of dowels. Where the shelf was placed the worst defects can be hidden, and it is too difficult to return it. But I would not purchase it again."
1,Dissapointed,"I should have just gone to Ikea like my Wife had told me to do. Not that Ikea stuff is that great, but this is complete junk. Its not even worth taking the time to disassemble and return. To the garbage it goes. Stay away."
1,just the opposite,"While the wholes in the wood matched up it isn't the right color! The item and the box say espresso, but when you open the box it is cherry wood! I have an espresso shelf from winsome and had no idea they would put a different finish on it! This company is a joke. And Amazon might be to for handling their merchandise."
2,Pain to put together,This shelf took me 2 hours to put together and there are gaps along the side because the holes are not the right size for the pegs or the screws. This is a horribly-made product - the only good thing is that it fits in the space I need it to fit in. I plan to attack it with a hammer and nails to secure it a little more.
4,Just nice,"Nice product, just a few scratches in the top but fortunately in the rear part, fits nice in my tiny bathroom, good for the price."
3,nice shelves,"these shelves are very nice. I had a little difficulty getting the dowels to match the holes but was able to do so. I, with very little handy person aptitude, was able to put this together almost on my own. I needed a little help pushing the shelf dowels in, but overall it was a simple procedure with easy to read instructions. I would recommend these. They were delivered in good time."
4,great piece for price,"Bought this shelving unit for a small space in the bathroom. Fits perfectly and stores a lot of towels and accessories. Some reviewers complained about the finish. We didn't have any problems. Finish is a dark brown color, similar to a walnut stain. It is solid wood and easy to put together. Only gave it 4 stars because it did come with packing paper stuck to a couple of shelves. It came off very easily with a damp rag and didn't hurt the finish. All in all, you can't beat the price for a piece of furniture made of real wood."
4,Good deal,"I'm satisfied with the product. However, it appears that the finish was botched in more areas that I would have liked on the shelves as well as the frame.While it fits most books and binders, you will have a hard time placing some portfolios on it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Purchased as extra shelving for a spare room. Everything about these shelves, from the materials to the fit, is of the poorest quality. I was barely able to assemble the unit due to the incredibly lame construction of the pieces. Absolutely not recommended for any purpose."
1,Horrible Mistake,No screws. No wooden screw caps. No allen wrench. The dowell rods would not line up because the holes were mis-drilled. This was FUBAR.
3,not what I expected.,"the product was not what I expected. It is not as stable on the floor and does not tighten to make it more secure. For the money, it could of been a better product."
3,i had this empty space,"everything i do until i develop god willing a revenue stream is always a trade-off between what i would like to have and what i can afford to have. this works for me. if it works for you -- it's not furniture, if you enjoy furniture. otherwise, it won't hurt you to have in your space. what i mean is, i once had enough money that i wouldn't have settled for this. but if you do't have that feeling, then this is a good buy. if that makes sense."
5,Fits the bill - reasonably priced,This is a solid little bookshelf that looks nice in the small area where I put it. A nice addition for my library.
4,Jones takes me to the Keys,In the Doublooner Weyman Jones takes me into several worlds I didn't know before. First there is the unique life style of Key West. Then there is the treasure hunting and diving world. He also dabbles a bit in cooking and resteraunteuring. (...)It is still a book of suspense and intrigue. Who will get the treasure? Who will get the girl. Who wears the doublooner?
4,The film has not aged - could be a 2012 release,"Contemporary theme to say the least (""How the News makes the news). Although there are more recent ""big stories"" analogous to the buried miner (The Ace in the Hole) who is the pawn in this story, the Atlanta Olympics, Richard Jewel and CBS is a good parallel.The Douglas and Jan Sterling characters are a bit over the top but this tragedy is a Jonathan Swift satire - perhaps facilitating release in 1951? In any case, the film is entertaining, horrifying and realistic - a civics lesson. that undoes the 4th estate."
4,Almost an Ace in the Hole,"This is a fantastic movie with Kirk Douglas, broke and down on his luck as a fomer big time journalist stuck in a small town in New Mexico.The story goes a bit overboard with the amount of people showing up for the ""incident"" in the cave and kind of detracts from the movies storyline.That is my only complaint !"
5,flashback,"I am glad to get the opportunity to see this movie once again. I remember seeing this film when I was only about twelve years old, around 40 years ago. I remember the anger, even hatred I felt for the reporter and also the sympathy and deep pity I felt for the trapped miner. A definite tribute to the acting and directing featured in this film. The profound effect this movie has had on my attitude towards the greedy and the exploitive in our society is enormous. To say this movie is ""powerful"" would be an absolute understatement."
2,disappointing; advice is obvious and not very innovative,"I was disappointed with this book. The money-saving advice is pretty obvious stuff -- use amateur photographers, have the wedding in a park, make your own dress, etc. I did like the examples in the back of the book of real-life budget weddings. Overall, however, I think that the useful parts of this book -- including the real-life examples -- could fit into a 3-page brochure."
3,It's different...but what did you expect?,"For the new Tull disc buyer, this is a warning. The first Ian Anderson solo disc from '83 sounds nothing like Tull, with exception of '84's Under Wraps and because of the prominence given keyboardist Peter-John Vettesse. If you didn't like Under Wraps, you won't like Walk Into Light. To be very honest, as a long-time Tull fan, I blow hot and cold on this disc. When I want to hear crunchy guitars and hot rockin', this disc won't do. But when I am feeling mellower or introspective, this is really a very good disc to listen to. Despite the heavy keyboard presence which contributes to a less warm album, the lyrics are really Ian's most personal at that point in Tull's long career. The production and arrangements are very well done. Stand-out tracks: Fly By Night, Trains, Endgame, Toad In The Hole, and User-Friendly."
3,The Second Part of a Coupled Entry,"Depending on how one views the landscape, this could be seen as the second solo effort by Ian Anderson, since the Jethro Tull album ""A"" was slated to be Anderson's debut, but was released under the band's name due to a decision by record company executives.Released in November 1983, it is a collaborative effort with keyboardist Peter-John Vettese that strides back into the progressive rock/electronics of ""A."" The 10 tracks are equally split between Anderson and Anderson/Vettese compositions, while clocking in at 38:29.The standout selections are Made in England, User-Friendly and Different Germany. The electronic period of Anderson (solo/band) is oftentimes overlooked by fans and critics, but it shows an artist attempting to use a variety of paints on a familiar canvas to keep the sound fresh, which is a creative walk down a lane of brilliant light."
4,Arresting title track,"I'm delighted to finally have this; it's been a gap in my IA/JT collection. First of all, this is not remastered--at least it doesn't say so anywhere on the packaging. (I've come to learn that remastering can sometimes do more harm than good.) It's worth having for the title track alone--vocally, IA does something akin to a scat. I've never heard him use his voice instrumentally in this way without blowing into a flute or harp. Here and elsewhere, his vocals are more subdued relative to his JT work. In hindsight, this might have been the direction he should have taken, given his voice problems from about this time onward. It's a good disc. Comparing it to corresponding JT releases is apples to oranges, but I would certainly reach for this over ""Broadsword,"" and no less often than ""Under Wraps."""
5,This is a MUST OWN CD!!,"Despite Ian Anderson's own liner notes review, I think this is a great piece of musical composition. I have waited over 10 years to find it on CD and now thanks to Amazon.com, I have found it. I recieved it today and to my delight it was a re-mastered copy so it sounded even better than the old tape that died on me 10 years ago. It is definately a well respected treasure in my growing collection. My hat is off to Ian Anderson! I also had waited over 20 years to see Jethro Tull in concert, and last year I finally saw them for the first time. It was AWESOME, they still sound (to me) as great as ever and put on an excellant show. I hope they continue to put out their great music into the next millenium!Jeff Winter"
5,great pick for the price,"this selection was nice and one of his earlier ideas on a solo carrer, but turned into the "" A"" alblum, worth getting for the collector"
3,I really kind of like this one.,"I bought the c.d. to replace a worn out cassette that I had bought a long time ago. Some songs like ""End Game"" and ""Trains"" are really pretty good. I'm not a big fan of drum machines but except for that, I like it."
5,A clever and unique spin on the traditional Supe shirt...,"I love this tshirt conceptually- it's a clever and unique spin on the traditional Supe shirt... The only thing unfortunate (for me!) is: they ran out of size medium, and the small is a bit small, while the large is way too large... Not the shirt's fault."
3,OK... if you like the smell of buckwheat!,The pocket to hold an herb sachet isn't an added feature... it's a necessity... because the smell of the buckwheat is otherwise overwhelming... and entirely unpleasant... ESPECIALLY when you're already experiencing discomfort in the shoulder or neck! It isn't that the wrap doesn't heat well or offer relief... it's just that the odor of the buckwheat is not tolerable. Discarded.
3,Good in parts,"The part thats intended for over your shoulders cools too fast. The rest of the item gets very hot, but cools down faster than other mircowavable items tried."
4,Love this item,I love the neck roll. I had a lot of tension in my neck and I used this product and all my pain went away. The only thing that could be improved upon is the oder. Wow what a stinky.But when you've got a pain in the neck it's worth it.
1,These guys might be good if they had vocals,What the hell is this crap? No vocals? How these guys ever got signed is beyond me. Get a singer and maybe I might enjoy this shlock garbage.
1,Sidewinder Precision Pro: You will need to buy a USB adapter,"I was very disappointed after purchasing a used Sidewinder Precision Pro Joystick. I learned later that the device has a 2 row 15 pin connector setup. This will not fit on a PC newer than about 2003 or 2004. If you wanted to use this then, you would need to purchanse an adapter which I have not bought yet. I will get the adapter and see if it works, it costs I think $10 or $15. I wish though, I would have gotten a joystick with a USB connector."
4,solid joystick,"I've had mine for a while now and after all this time and abuse, it still works just like new. Wish newer joysticks were as good. As for anyone saying that this will not work in windows xp, they're dead wrong. If you attach it to a gameport, just add it through the game controllers interface in the control panel. If through the accompanying usb dongle, it'll automagically be detected. It works great in all my games new and old."
4,Works fine with XP,"I am confused by the claims that this joystick does not work with XP. XP is plug-and-play: just hook up the USB adapter and plug the thing in. It registers perfectly. Go to control panel and mess with the calibration and test all your buttons - that works perfectly as well. One drawback in not being able to use the W95 software is a lack of ability to reprogram the buttons - no biggie since most software will let you do the same, but I dropped one star for that reason. XP users - don't concern yourself with the disk that comes with the joystick, just plug the thing in and get on with the games!"
5,"Great for flying games, make that all games.","This joystick is great for all kinds of games particularly flight sims. I love its rudder controls. All you have to do is twist the stick left or right. It has tons of buttons, all fully programmable. If you want to buy a joystick, definetly purchase this one, don't get the force feedback, that stick is just plain annoying."
5,Well Worth It !!!,"Every Friends fan should have this DVD set. Classic episodes, great extras, well worth the money. If you love friends you'll treasure this collection forever."
4,Endless joy!,"FRIENDS is fantastic. A reviewer called Janitor-X said everything here is commercial, produced only to make money. Ok, I agree. Sports, movies, TV shows, profit is behind them all, the ratings are the Gods. But, anyway, if you don't have quality you will not sell for a long time, I guess...Also, by purchasing the DVD set, you will NOT watch the advertising!I began to watch FRIENDS renting some episodes, I live outside the U.S., and here in my country FRIENDS is aired on cable-TV, and I never had payed much attention to them or any sitcoms in general. Now, I'm totally ""addicted"". The episodes all are acessible tor epeated views, it's amazing.So why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5? Because, for a DVD set with such glorious packaging, the amount of extras is close to none. There is no cast interview, no staff interview, no making off, almost nothing!"
5,"You Can Never Have Too Much ""Friends""","""Oh, my God!"" were the words I said when my husband presented me with my ""Friends"" complete first season all wrapped up in the Amazon.com wrapping paper. I was just about the happiest person IN the world. Poor Hubby didn't know what he had done. First, I read all there was to read on the set. I saw the producers' commentary which was fantastic. Then went straight to the ""Friends"" quiz which I aced, thank you very much. Finally, one by one, I savored the episodes catching the extra footage which was such a nice bonus. These actors are just ""perfection"". Please note for fan in San Marcos, TX, Joey's showdown with Mr. Hombre is in Episode 25 in Season 2. I will be looking forward to seeing it soon also. My opinion: Buy Season 1 and all the rest when available. Laughter is the best medicine."
5,They won me over,"Believe it or not, I never watched ""Friends"" during the entire time that it was in production. Sure, I caught a scene here and there while channel surfing, but I never saw an entire episode. I was put off by its trendiness and wide popularity and rather annoyed by Lisa Kudrow's performance as Phoebe (I still think she's the weak link in the cast). However, I finally decided to see what all the commotion was about and watched the entire first season. I'm hooked! The scripts are witty, the six main characters have distinct personalities, and the secondary characters and story arcs are well developed. I feel lucky to have eight seasons worth of episodes left that I have never seen."
5,It's about time,"Finally Warner Bros is releasing Friends on DVD in complete seasons, rather than the silly ""Best Of""s. The complete season DVDs have been available in Europe for years now. Right from the start of the pilot episode, you can tell this group of six has great chemestry. Hopefully subsequent seasons won't be too far off. Now if we could only start to get complete seasons of Seinfeld, I'd be in heaven."
5,motor cycle lover,"i am a huge fiends fan, so i cannot say any ill words about any of the episodes or seasons but i do have to add that although this cast does have chemistry with one another, the first season was a little less chemistry than the other 9. by the 2nd season, they were much more in tune with each other and they just got better as the years went on."
1,"Unfunny Crap,","Why is this show so freakin popular????!!!!!! It's not funny at all, these actors have no talent!!!!! How the heck did this garbage last ten seasons? I don't care if lots of people like it that dosn't make it good. There are lots of shows out there that are popular but that dosn't make them good. Here are some examples, Will and Grace, Darma and Greg, Everybody loves Raymond, SNL, those crappy stand up comedy shows they have on Comedy Central. Theres so many, but Friends sucks the most, and whats even worse there are no cute guys on the show, just guys that think their hot."
1,Why subject yourself?,"Friends is immensely popular. No doubt. And I guess I understand that. The characters are very much like the ""populars"" you find in high school. Maybe a little bit smarter. Definitely a little bit funnier. But they're are the same shallow, repulsive folks that--if you had a little on the ball--you tried to avoid. Like the plague. You know the type. The girls who were more attractive than average, usually really skinny, and way too chipper. And then the guys. Kinda clunky. No depth at all. Smug.As you might have guessed, I find it very difficult to watch this show. Far from making me laugh, these characters make me want to leave. And the writing is so flat, so corporate, so uninspired, that it amounts to junk-food humor, with a carefully orchestrated laugh track so numbed viewers know exactly where to laugh.It's because of stuff like this that I've stopped watching TV altogether. Try it."
1,PATHETIC!,"If there was a worst show on T.V. in the history of entertainment, this already takes the cake. I don't understand why people love such garbage with a bunch of morons trying to be funny when really they're NOT! All the jokes are only a tad bit funny at times while others just don't make me laugh whatsoever. The characters are boring and act like they're on something and the plot is just pointless! Don't get me wrong, I thought it was a nice try, but this CANNOT hold a candle next to other programs like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Family Guy"". Skip this and get the DVDs for those instead."
1,God Awful!,"I'd like to say that I respect the cast of Friends. Even though I do respect them, they starred in possibly the worst show in history. It's just not funny. Watch more funny comedies such as Seinfield and The Simpsons. That's all I have to say."
1,Overrated!,"I agree with what other people said. This is a case of a product that is absolutely overrated. God knows why.The actors, including Aniston, are awful. The jokes are pathetic. The laughs after five minutes are annoying as hell.Please... I wonder how can something as bad as this was able to carry on for ten years!To watch an entire season of friends is basically submitting yourself to a stream of stupid jokes, that are not funny under any possible perspective.Friends is low quality television. To avoid carefully."
3,mmmm,"The service was normal but the item was not in the conditions mentioned. I honestly think the item you sent me was not ""like new"""
1,DO NOT BUY - Warning ! ! !,"I just purchased the dvd package of ""Friends"" Season 1 Complete Season. There are serious flaws with this dvd package. Having only had time to play DVD 1 - the last 3 episodes refuse to play with the exception of about 40 seconds of a scene from each of the missing episodes. I have to say I'm very disappointted that Warner Brothers never bothered to check the quality of their product. I luv Friends - but this dvd package is a disaster ! ! !BUYER BEWARE ! ! !"
5,Friends,"It was requested by my granddaughter. She is collecting the entire series, and couldn't find that one. She loved it."
5,amazing!,This show is hilarious. I've watched the first season over and over and it keeps getting funnier. Love it so much
4,The One with the Missing Episode,"Ok, I'll admit it... I like FRIENDS a lot. But I think there's a missing episode from the collection. In the thanksgiving episode, where Joey is a poster boy for VD, he talks to a woman in the subway that he knew from being the ""Aramis Guy."" Well, there was an episode where he was the Aramis Guy and was challenged by the Hombre Man. It seems that episode would have belonged in sequence. Oh well, other than that possible omission it's a great set."
5,Terrific!,Friends is a terrific program and it is wonderful to be able to watch hours of it commercial free!
4,discs are like new,"the box is just hacked but the discs are like brand new so I can't complain too much, very pleased with purchase and loving the discs, watching them constantly."
5,I miss these people....,My Thursdays were never the same when this show went off the air. Smart writing and a terrific cast made this a must see on Thursday nights.
5,region coding,"this is a great DVD. i bought a new multi-region player for it specially, but as it turns out, it is coded in region 1, 2, 3, and 4!!!!!! therefore i would recommend this DVD to anyone in these regions, even if i did have to pay ...import taxes. it was well worth it."
5,Great....,"Excellent product. I really love Friends and this season is great. I'd like to be sure about subtitles in the future, fortunately this DVD is ok about it."
2,Disappointment.,"I finally got around to watching my new Friends DVDs, which I bought because I loved the show when I was young. I watched the first three DVDs with no problems whatsoever, but when I went to move on to the fourth disc, it was so scratched that my DVD player couldn't play any part of the DVD. I'm highly disappointed with this."
5,Awesome!,This is one of my favorite seasons of Friends. The DVD is great- it's really neat to listen to the commentary on the Pilot episode and to hear what the producers have to say about how Friends got started and how it all came together. I love looking back on this season and seeing how all the characters have evolved since this season. It's excellent! Very funny! I definitely reccommend it! :)
5,Charming!,I've watched at least once all 24 episodes like I was hooked and hypnotized. DVD has every episode extended (thereby more unaired footages filling the space of commercials); every episode CHARMS you in whether or not you are completely convinced.
2,"The video quality good, sound not so good","I have purchased the first three seasons of Friends through Amazon instant video. The video looks good, but the sound doesn't always match the video. Sometimes it's a little behind, sometimes it's a little ahead. It can make watching this quite frustrating at times. I checked out my season 2 as well and it does the same thing. I have ordered videos on amazon instant video that are just fine, it seems to be just a problem with Friends series. I would wait to purchase this until the kinks have been worked out."
5,Fantastic!,This was such a great way to get Friends the complete first season. I had seen it other places for $... and that was just the first season alone (at Border's--way expensive!!) I got my dvd set 4 days after I ordered it in a sealed box protecting the dvds. The dvd set itself was sealed in plastic and brand new & very nice condition!! I am enjoying watching all the discs now! I definitely recommend buying from Amazon.com!
5,Friends DVD,bought for 10 year old niece..she loved it. I still watch reruns and she was so excited when she saw that she got Season 1 and 2
5,ahhh nastalgia,"I really have missed the friends I grew up with! I'm buying this series one episode at a time, my only complaint is that I would like to be able to buy the full season digitally at once."
4,Friends S1,Friends: The Complete First Season (200) just DVD not much to say about them you have to like Friends ;-)
3,Poor quality,I don't know if it's because I am looking at a NTSC DVD in a Pal TV but the image quality of this DVD is very poor. Some else notice this? It looks like a poorly compressed Video CD in my set.
4,Not bad...,"When I first played this game, I was amazed.The masks and wepons are amazing.I didnt play it for a while and my first black controler broke. Then i bought a ps1 white controler and it wouldnt work with this game,so be careful !!"
4,Splinter Cell Rip Off,"This game is a Splinter Cell Rip Off it makes you hide the bodies, hacking sneaking up behind people and killing them the graphics stink and their's basiclly no light in the first level the tutourail bottom lineTHIS GAME BLOWS DONT WASTE YOUR CASH"
4,Amazing!,"This Game Is Amazing!Well First Off,I Wanna Say That This Website Got The Game Priced TOO HIGH.(...) So Now For the review, I rented this and saw how good this was and couldnt see how one of my friends said he hated it, but i gave it a try myself and this game was crazy as hell,it lives up to its standards but Tom Cruise should've Lended his voice to it and his likeness it wouldn't hurt but overall this game is crazy (...) I Recommend It If Ur A Fan Of The Adrenaline Rush And Splinter Cell. Imma Go Buy It Right Now!"
2,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!,"I was actually pissed i spent money on this. the movie was good (even though i hate tom cruise) but this game was just crap. This was like a wanna be metal gear. honestly the very first level shows how much this game is lacking. the weapons were crappy and the whole game just overall supplied nothing. Wasnt original wasnt fun, and sadly the graphics were junk! sorry kids this game's no good."
3,mixed opinions,"MI:Operation Surma kind of sucks. I mean replay value for this game switches between high to nothing and controls (gun handling in particular) are very hard to get used to. This is a Splinter Cell rip-off and I reccommend that you don't buy this unless you're a hardcore video game nerd or a freak for video games. The only game this game beats is Family Guy the Game. Graphics however for this game I'll admit are pretty decent, or fine VERY GOOD as well as the AI, but I have to recommend that you stay away from this game."
3,average,"i bought this game and foolishly expected splinter cell. dont get me wrong, its fun,but it has a huge lack of moves and activities. pretty much all you get is a 3 hit combo, and a tranq gun. the only good move is the corner kill, but you cant use it a lot.id say, its worth a test run for no more than $20."
4,Yes it's a nice tight compilation,"Yes, this is a good compilation. It pretty much covers the best of latin music today. The live performances sound great.Hopefully there'll be more releases like this in the future."
5,Completely indespensible to anyone interested in the mind,"I encountered this book in the late 80's, and it became one of the most influential books in my life.This book, essentially collates, combines, and compares theories of how the human mind works, finding parallels, offering interpretations, and finding intersections of ideas. From Frued to Marx, Jung to Blake, it's an amazing trip through explanations of ""us,"" and served as my first introduction to concepts of cybernetics and feedback in mental and information systems.If you're involved in psychology, social work, programming, writing, anything that touches on the mind and information, get it and read it. You'll be a much richer person for it."
1,Dissappointed,Hi. I'm eight years old. I have read the Caddie Woodlawn book and I have been to her homestead in Wisconsin. I was dissapointed that the Movie was not like the Caddie Woodlawn book. Many events that happened in the book do not happen in the movie or they are different. If you want to really experience the wild and adventuresome Caddie Woodlawn I would recommend reading the bookHaley
3,Ancient Lust,"Dorothy Porter's frank sexual tone works well with this ancient tale of power, mysticism and intrigue. A narrative verse as effective as 'Monkey's Mask,' Porter seduces the readers into a realm of enchanting deities and distant mythology where mummification could almost pass as a kinky sex-play."
4,I need more,What happens after that! Gimme more. THis is unfair...somebody do something! IT ends way too soon.
2,At least it's over...,"I know that all other reviewers hit on the fact that the series ends very abruptly. And they are right, of course, it does end abruptly. However, I was tremendously relieved that it did end when it did. To me, it was kinda like watching a train wreck...I just couldn't look away.Of course, you may want to take this in with the information that for me, this series ended after the 1st half of the series. For the most part, I found the 2nd half too experimental, farily dull, and not at all keeping with the tone of the 1st half. (if I wanted to read the manga, I wouldn't have bought the DVDs, now would I?)That being said, I've started reading the manga and it is great! (I'm not very far yet, though)So, final thoughts....? If you've already gotten this far in the series, you will want to see it to it's conclusion, but don't expect anything."
4,Tasteful,"The book is informative, easy to read and tastefully illustrated. I was surprised by how much the Kama Sutra positions weren't as crazy as I'd imagined."
3,Good beginner Kama Sutra,I enjoyed this book with my partner-and feel it is a good beginning book-most of the insights are pretty well known and the positions described are fairly natural-no gymnastic ability required. Somewhat challenging to follow logically-but a good general reference. Definitely whets curiosity for more thorough coverage of this famous title.
1,Acrobatics doesn't equal passion. This book is over-rated.,Many challenging sexual positions here. Hooper's pervasively snide attitude will make you feel like a failure if you can't work up the energy to try it her way.Want to have FUN in bed? Be kind to your lover and give this book a miss.
1,Not worth it,"I did not enjoy this book at all. There was NOTHING new in it for me. And I truly didn't buy it to see naked people pressed against each other, I am looking for the more adventurous positions. Organization in the book is almost if not unexistant, the point of the book are the pictures it seems. Not worth the money, I sent mine right back for a refund."
4,Nice pictures,"I got this book for my wedding. I'm glad I got it. Too many people, especially men, attempt sexual acts like those seen in porn movies, and fail miserably, if not painfully in the process. This book on the other hand, shows the pluses and minuses of various love-making positions. One only wonders how many the auhor has attempted herself.A book such as this relies on pictures as much as words; and the pictures are quite good. Most of the sex scenes are played out by live couples, except for the explicit scenes of entry, etc... Interestingly, for a book based on an ancient Indian text, all of the models shown in this book are surprisingly light skinned. I've heard that in India and in most of Asia, light skin is prized more highly than dark skin. Maybe this biasness has seeped into this book? Overall a good book though."
3,Not bad. Not bad at all.,"This is a good book, with clear pictures. I must admit that I was hoping for a book that had both clear pictures and the full text of the original Kama Sutra. We've had some fun already with this and I recomend it if you're in the doldrums needing some fresh ideas. There's nothing revolutionary, but perhaps a few good variations and some interesting concepts. Can't lose for the price."
2,I would expect better from Hooper,"Ok, its not to bad, but not to good either. First off, the book is huge, not in lenght, but in actual size. Its hard to even fit it on a book shelf.It has nice photographs, and several pictures of positions etc. But it doesnt go into detail enough on how to do the possitions. I found that when my girfriend and I tried them, it was more work than fun. I think it would have been easier if Hooper described how to go about the possitions in detail rather than showing other couples making it look easy.If I had another chance, I would have looked through the book more before I bought it."
4,Good in its own way,"That way has very little to do with Vatsyayana's classic, but this is enjoyable anyway.This is really Hooper's own guide to happy coupling. Her advice about the emotional and physical facts of sex is generally solid, but this book stays close to mainstream practices and attitudes. Generous illustration is a real plus - one couple in lots of photos, demonstrating many positions and kinds of embrace. This is very helpful in the places where Hooper quotes Burton's translation of the Kama Sutra, since his Victorian circumlocutions sometimes make it nearly impossible to figure out just which body parts go where. In fact, the photos are so strong and varied that an illustrator might consider using this book just as a visual reference.This isn't for the serious student of Eastern classics. It may be a fun way for a limber couple to explore different ways of coupling, though.//wiredweird"
3,Depends on what you're looking for;,"If what you're looking for is a sex manual that will be informative to anyone who is already reasonably informed on the subject, this book isn't for you. If you're looking for hard-core pornography, this book isn't for you. On the other hand, if you're a relative novice, I suppose that there may be some helpful information here, and if what you're looking for is excellent erotica (or for those less inclined toward euphemisms, soft-core porn) the book is excellent. The photos are extremely erotic, although they never show genitalia; the models, although apparently actually engaged in sex, are always positioned strategically so that, while we see breasts, buttocks, backs, even nipples, we never see even a hint of pubic hair, much less vaginas or penises. (We do see artists renderings of them in a couple of insets, but not actual photos.)"
4,More than positions,I think this book misses out on the major element of terrific sex -- passion and romance. I'd recommend you read The RoMANtic's Guide in conjuction with this book and you will practically live in the bedroom.
3,"""Yesterday's News""","Nothing new here folks! Been there...done that...bought the t-shirt. But even so, ""Anne Hooper's Kama Sutra,"" is still interesting enough if one enjoys wishing or perhaps fantasizing about having sex witha a magazine or in this case a book. Hey, it beats a blank, so don't knock it I always say."
5,A long overlooked gem,"I confess I haven't seen this movie on video -- I saw it only once at the theater several years ago when it was first released ... and I've always been baffled by its commercial failure. (Not even ""sophisticated"" moviegoers in New York, where I caught it at the only moviehouse that deigned at the time to screen it, seemed interested.) It's just plain terrific, and if perhaps by talking it up in this space I can help to convince its distributor to rerelease it, my words won't have been in vain. Understated, with beautifully muted colors and Soderbergh's unsentimental appreciation for depression-era life (and, eventually, survival) in a shabby St. Louis residential hotel. Based, as I recall, on a physician's memoir of his boyhood. Hope I haven't portrayed it as solemn and dreary -- it's anything but."
5,Use it every day!,I like to relax every morning in a long hot bath while reading my Kindle. For years I have been cursed with the drain on my tub until I happened to run across this product on Amazon. I stuck it over my drain and like magic I can read in peace! It will come unstuck after a few uses but by just quickly pressing it tight every morning you can be assured it will stay on. Well worth it if you like to take deep baths!
3,OK,"This item seems to work, the seal seems imperfect with all of the small suction cups and it's somewhat tedious to get on. I have to hold it in place and work every suction cup on or it will not stay in place. Once in place, it worked well enough that it did the job. I did not notice the top hole in the picture, so you can't fill the tub past the cover. The result being that this cover gives you about an extra two to four inches of water, depending on your current overflow set up."
2,not worth the money,I still have it because I never got around to throwing it away. Does not work. Don't buy.Would recommend just putting plastic over your drain to keep water from escaping.
4,Does the job well- but make sure to remove often!,"This works well for what it is intended, and offers a relaxing deeper bath. I enjoyed this product through winter, when I took a hot bath every night and the product has held up well.Make sure to remove it and clean it frequently, or it will get moldy. In the upstairs bath where it was used frequently and cleaned frequently we did not have this issue, however in the downstairs tub where one was used once or twice and left there, it did mold around the suction and I had to bleach it."
2,way too big,i was really excited about this item but i dont think it is going to function at all. it is way to big for my tub and about 30% of it doesnt have a place to stick on to.boo.
4,review,"All the suction cups do not seem to stick to the tub like they should, but it still manages to work properly."
5,good for old apartments,I wasn't sure that this was going to work and reviewed all the previous comments carefully. I have an old apartment and the tub was made for teeny tiny people...this made it possible to at least soak to my chest...it is a bit tempermental though...prewarming the plastic is some hot water makes it much easier to use- not all the suction cups worked all the way around but by using the ones on the bottom and sides I enjoyed a full tub again.
4,Deep Water Bath Is Good,"I've used this product for several years. This is a good product... effective, and gives you the ability to have a good soak with your shoulders down in the water. However, order TWO of them (I did). They don't last forever... only a year or two, depending on how much you use it. After that, the little suction cups stop working (so it falls off and doesn't work), and the clear plastic becomes discolored and kind of funky.Still, I can't find anything else that makes a deeper bath possible. I like having a second one anyhow. I keep it in my suitcase... it does a good job in hotel bathtubs. Sometimes after a long day of traveling, I NEED a hot bath! Hotel tubs can be really shallow."
3,Deep Water Bath,"I was very disappointed that this did not fit over our drain fixture -- and ours looks just like the advertised picture. I can squeeze it on partially, but I have to hold it in place with my feet.........not too relaxing! I would actually change the drain fixture but it's fairly new and was very expensive. so I'll just have adapt if I use it!"
1,Horrible,Just got this stopper in the mail today and to my disappointment it would'nt even stick on the tub(After standing for 9 hours straight I was really looking forward to a good bath).I kept trying to get the tiny suction cups to stay on the tub but it kept slipping. Don't get this product you will be very disappointed.
4,Works as described,"This is a great idea for a product. I like it alot, works as described - However there is one problem. It has a hole at the top of it to prevent overflowing. My bathtub is pretty large and the drain isn't at the very top of it, so I had to put tape over the hole to get a deeper water level."
5,Love this,This is all I ever wanted to enjoy a bath. I finally get to fill the tub up to the brim and keep it that way. It is also large enough to fit over different types of drainers so I can take it traveling with me.
1,Waste of money,"Does not work, water get through it and it doesn't stick. Do not buy this product unless you want to be frustrated with the lack of results."
3,Suction Could be Improved,"It's large and covers a standard overflow valve, which is great, but the suction could be improved. It falls off a few times during my soaks. I just have a standard porcelain tub, so I wouldn't have expected this to be an issue. :("
5,Best thing sice sliced bread,I bought this instead of changing the water boiler to hold more hot water. I can now get in the bath with my baby girl and we both love the deeper water for longer. Buy this!
1,Not Worth It,"Really simple this item has little suction cups all the way around the rim but with gaps in between. In short, it can't create a solid seal. It will slow down the water into the drain... a little but that's it."
1,does not work,"As others have stated, this needs an entire ring suction seal, rather than spaced suction cups. Water flows between the spaces!Great idea, needs improvement on the implementation."
5,Surprisingly Effective for the Price,"This inexpensive overflow cover works well for the price. I was skeptical at first because it doesn't create a perfect seal around the overflow drain...then again, I'm not an engineer. It keeps the water away from the overflow drain, even when the water almost reaches the open circle on top of it. At $6, it's a great deal considering the plumbing bills it's preventing.When you first get it, it's best to wet the suction cups, apply it over the overflow drain, and then fill your tub. After that, to regularly maintain it I've been washing it with a bit of dish soap and a toothbrush every week or so to keep it from getting any mineral buildup."
3,Would be amazing if it stuck to the side of the tub.,"I have used this item with two different bath tubs. The suction will stick to one but not fully to another. The issue seems to be the tub material, rather than the contour of the tub. That said, when it works, I love the thing! Sometimes, I just press the better bath suction cups down while the water is filling over that area. The pressure from the water will often increase the suction. Having those precious extra inches of water makes a difference in my baths."
5,Deep Bath,"Very well made, and fits snugly around the drain thingy. Whatever that is called. Makes for a great soaking tub. Hubby loves it too. He takes more baths now, as opposed to showers. Very relaxing."
5,got the job done,just make sure you clean it out on a regular basis. can fill your bathtub all the way up. GREAT
5,Cheapest remodel ever,"Works wonderfully. Can't believe I put up with a shallow tub, not getting much more than my behind wet. I do recommend removing it for playful kids, though. Obviously the margin of safety (from overflow) is much smaller."
5,Glad I stumbled onto this cool little product,This simple device allows me to get another 2 inches of water in the tub and no dribble draining noise either. It sure beats trying to cover the drain hole with my foot. The only downside it has is that I now have to remove the tub stopper to let out some water to add more hot water. It used to drain out on it's own.
4,great for a deep soak,"We've had one of these for ages and it's great, really lets you fill the tub and sink down for a long soak. We just bought one as part of a bath-basket gift and the recipient loves it too."
5,Does exactly that,The deep water bath does exactly what it was bought for and the seller shipped to me immediately got it in three days.
5,Cheapo piece of plastic,"When I ordered, I was very skeptical even with the good reviews, when I got the product I was even more skeptical since it didnt look like it would work, or leak... then I tried to apply it with the tiny little suction cups, and it did stick, even though it was curved on the tub there.. filled the tub up, got in and it worked, not even a tiny leak. So it blew my expectations out of the water.. no pun intended.Save yourself the hustle and money of getting a plumber and installing that high drain, and get this nifty item... even if it got brittle or discolored after a couple of months I would reorder in a heartbeat... (please manufacture, dont redesign it to do this)"
5,A True Life Saver,"I was in despair when my apartment management replaced my ancient leaky bathtub with a new and, alas, far shallower tub. This product makes all the difference. Super easy to apply and remove, it allows me to fill the tub right up to the rim. Hurrah!One thing I noticed while shopping -- other similar products may cost a few dollars less, but they are often smaller. The largest diameter provides the deepest bath. Also the depth of the cover is important if, like me, you have a drain control with a little handle; the cover needs to fit over that projecting handle. So bigger is better."
5,Works just as it should. Great product!,"I have been buying these from Bed, Bath, and Beyond for years. They work wonderfully and give you that few extra inches of water to soak in. They hold up well with my only complaint being rust colored staining over time but that is more due to my water than anything else. Highly recommend!"
4,As promised,"I don't usually write reviews, but in this case I made an exception. This works just as promised! I have had mine, which I ordered here on Amazon, for a few months now and I love it! The suction cups do their job and I can fill my tub as high as I like now. I am thinking of ordering another, just to have a back-up, as I'm sure over time the suction cups will loose their suction."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a piece of cr*#. What was supposed to be the most relaxing bath ever ended up being a wet exercise in frustration just trying to get this thing to work. The suction cups are taller than the inner lip, which therefore can't reach the surface it's supposed to seal. so the water leaks right through. Seriously. Do yourself a favor. Try another one."
3,works well but too deep and looks kinda ugly,"great idea for a product, which gave me an idea of my own: I took the existing overflow cover and flipped it around, so that the overflow holes are facing up, not down. It looks uglier now because the holes are visible when standing or sitting in the tub, but the bath water level can now be higher without the need to attach anything like this thing. It's going back because of this.Also, this attachment is way deeper than it needs to be and so protrudes forward too much - my metal overflow cover, as well as any other covers I see sold now can easily hide behind it. And it looks kinda cheap and artificial on the tub. But it definitely does its job."
3,Poor suction,"I bought one of these a while ago that worked perfectly. I had to buy a new one and it doesn't suction very well. The only difference I could see is my old one said ""Made in USA"" and this new one is ""Made in Taiwan"". Still gets 3 stars because I actually got two of the suction cups to stick so it still worked."
3,Kind of works,"When I used this cover, it slowed the water down, but didn't totally keep water from leaking down the drain. I guess it's better than water gushing down!"
1,Doesn't work,"Please don't buy this. It fastens with suction cups and if you have any sloping or curving near your drain, this will not work. I didn't return it solely because it was only $5, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money in the first place."
3,Works but,if you turn the item so it works for the tub be sure to adjust for when you use the shower ... otherwise it collects water during your shower ...
3,Deep Water Bath now possible,I bought this and actually have only used it once....I bought a bath lift chair and thought I would need a lot of water to use it but really don't. It worked fine.
5,Just what I needed!!!,"I live in the basement apartment of an old house and the overflow drain is in the middle of the tub. It didn't even cover my legs sitting in the bath! This was exactly what I needed and I'm so happy I found it! It works great! It adds easily 3-4 inches for me since my drain is so low and pretty large. I have had zero problems with the suction. Just get the surface and the suctions wet and they stay on without any issues. I absolutely love my bath time and now I can enjoy long, deep baths again! Highly recommended!!!"
4,Square,I have a square overflow drain. Can anyone recommend a product similar that will work on a square flow? This thing looks great and id love one for my tub.
5,Adds depth to my shallow tub!,Our tub is very shallow and I am not the tallest person so I know it will be even more useful to others! I got this because since I got into the third trimester of pregnancy my belly is no longer able to get under the water... Thanks to this product I can take more comfortable baths. It adds a nice extra depth of about 3 in to my tub.It has a hole on top so that in case the water WOULD go over that then it would start to drain it.-Carolina
3,started to warp,this thing was warped and wouldn't stay on after a while. it's cheap and lasted a while so i guess it was worth the money but not really a long run thing.
5,In love.,I absolutely love my deep bath time!! Perfect for water up to your neck. Pair it with a great pillow and some soothing suds....Ahhhhmazing.
4,Bath stopper,"This product is Ok . Its a little bit difficult to attach , you would think that its easy but its not, but in the end helps a lot, not 100% but a lot. And its so cheap its worth it."
4,It works!,"We have a garden tub with jets and with two people in the bath it gets full. This product will help save your water! It comes off every now and then, because suction cup do that at times, but over all it stays on and works. :)"
5,A Must Have!,"I LOVE this water stopper! It is durable and it is great at filling up your tub and not falling off! This is one of my favorite purchases ever, I love this little device! It also has an opening at the very top so that if the water is going to spill over the tub it will fill up and get too heavy to stay on the tub. While I've never tried this out, I think it is a handy little addition in case you somehow forget to turn off your water. I've used this water stopper countless time and i've had it for a year and a half and it is still working just like new!"
5,Great!!,I love this product!!!! It actually sticks to the tub unlike some products with suction cups. It really does let the bathtub fill all the way up. You must keep an eye on the bathtub so that it doesn't overflow ;-)
5,It Works,"I moved to an apartment with a smaller bath, and the drain made it so there wasn't enough water to keep me warm. I got this and it has worked perfectly, allowing me to take enjoyable warm baths again."
5,Use mine every day,"Its perfect! Sure makes a difference in the water level. We have hard water, and if I spray mine with the Dow Scrubbing Bubbles and let it sit, it comes out looking like new. If your dont have a garden tub, this is the next best thing."
5,This Rocks,"I was very skeptical, too, but this thing works exactly as advertised. It's great and the couple of extra inches of water in the tub really make a difference. My tub is a 1920s cast-iron built-in that some lunkhead decided to paint with a brush, so they scored the surface. I got rid of the paint and left it ""as is,"" so I was a bit worried that the suction cups wouldn't adhere to the scored ceramic. No problem. I put the device in the hot water as I filled the tub and it was in a very flexible state when I attached it. I really didn't expect it to work, but it did. I rarely take baths, but will do so more often now."
5,Anyone can now have a deep tub.,"I really want to replace my current tub with a spa tub. Since I can not afford to do that, this has been a great alternative. If you are looking to take a relaxing bubble bath, this makes it so much nicer. The extra inch or two of water makes a big difference. These still is a hole to drain the water to prevent overflow, but you get to choose based on how you suction the piece where the hole is, up top like in the picture, or to the side. The piece easily suctions on and off. We have been using it with no problem for about half of a year."
4,Does the job,"This product works as advertised, but the little suction cups sometimes don't want to stick to the tub. For the price, though, I'd recommend it."
3,Does half the job,I was really excited to get this product. I have been having a hard time getting it to stick to my tub. I even tried it on another tub surface and it doesnt stick well. It does the job but you just have to make sure that you are not getting water inside in because then it falls off mid-fill up. It can be frustrating! It was worth the price however.
4,I like it!,I really like the better bath deep water bath device. I did find that I had to turn the hole towards the side so the running water didn't fill it up & knock it off. But it works great & I can fill my regular tub up all the way to the top for a relaxing bath.
5,finally something i can use.,"I was just thinking that someone should invent a product to get a deeper water bath.. I love my bathtime to just relax in very hot water ,but the water kept draining out . I would plug it with decals and was even going to fill it in with tub cocking lol.. not really but wanted to.. then I found this Better Bath Deep Water Bath ,,, wow is all i can say it is great..."
1,Disappointed,I was really looking forward to this thing. I love baths but hate that you can't fill the tub up. I thought this was the answer. But the darn thing won't stick. No matter what I try. What a waste of money
1,Didn't Work At All For Me,"I had this when I lived in an apartment with a very shallow tub. It wasn't a big investment, which is why I tried it, but it didn't really work either. It did allow a little more water, but it usually fell off in the first five minutes, so not really useful at all. If I held it on with my foot--a trick I established--it lasted a little longer, though water still seeped in around the parts I wasn't holding down and drained out, albeit more slowly than if I wasn't holding it on, but that's not terribly effective or comfortable. Kind of surprised to see such positive reviews here. (And I tried all the suction cup tricks, too, to no avail, at least with my model.)"
1,Useless if your overflow drain is recessed,"Your overflow drain must be flush mounted against the tub wall or this unit will not adhere, rendering it useless. I returned it, disappointed -- in both the lack of results and the absence of a consumer warning to this effect."
2,Water seeped through.,"I was thrilled to see this product listed since my tub is shallow. It didn't work up to my expectations, though. I tried to reposition the device a few times, but the water was always able to seep between the suction cups."
2,Doesn't stay on,"I'm not happy with this purchase. It does not stay on. I would not recommend this. Don't buy this, Save your money."
4,Really good product,Works really well. Nice to have a deeper soak!Came exactly as promised. I also like that it ismade in USA
2,Not enough suction...,I have always had one of these to enhance my otherwise shallow bath. The suction cups on this one are not very good and require a lot more effort to get it to stay in place.
5,Absolutely the best,"I first read this books nine years ago, and have read it countless times since then. I have read over 100 romance book and this is the absolute best. No other characters can even begin to share the kind of chemistry that Stacy and Cord have together. I will always love this book and Stacy and Cord will always have a place in my heart."
1,I hope an editor did NOT get paid for this,"You would think that in 37 years the typos, grammatical errors, and random commas used through out this book could have been fixed. I am talking about the Kindle version. Perhaps the paper edition is readable. The story is ok, but I couldn't even read it because of the errors. If I owned a book store I would try to make sure that the books I sold were at least coherent! I'm so mad I paid money for this I'm going to try to get it refunded!"
1,Extremely Disappointing,"This was a very confusing DVD selection to try and purchase as different sources made mention that this would be the ""complete"" series. Well, after viewing the DVD's it's very clear that numerous episodes were ommitted which makes me glad that I still own the ""complete"" series on videotape. My second complaint is the terrible production quality of these recordings. Could they have put any less effort into these reproductions? Very POOR POOR quality! I'm sorry I wasted my money! Missing episodes include: Chump Secret Code, Weather or Not, The Sour Taste of Success, The Barron's Birthday Ball, The Spy Who Went Out in the Cold, Too Many Chumps, The Mysterious Motorcycle Menace, The Great Beauty Contest, Chump Takes a Holiday, To Tell the Tooth, The Great Brain Drain and The Great Double Double Cross."
1,"Too bad, I was really pumped up too.","This HAS to be a bootleg. The film quality is awfull. I mean REALLY awfull. It would look better if it was filmed with a camera phone. There are parts in the shows where you can't even tell it's in color it's so bad. It's a shame, I really loved the show, but it's such an awfull copy that I only watched one show, then flipped through the others to see if they were any better. They weren't. Huge bummer. Don't waste your money."
1,Incomplete and bad quality,I am echoing what others have said--not the complete series and very bad quality--what I saw on the TV in the early 70s looked better than this!
3,70s kitsch chimpsploitation,"This show is kind of fun if you enjoy 60s/70s kitsch and/or the chimpsploitation genre. I have a major issue with the voice of the ""Mata Hairi"" character (Joanie Gerber). To my ears this voice is more grating than nails across a chalkboard! It's just incredibly annoying."
3,Go Ask Alice Very tame,"It had to be a made for TV movie. NO DOUBT AT ALL. While the movie was 0K in a 70's kind of way, to much 'meat' was chopped (read the book) to be a ""scary"" look at 60's teenage drug use. Course I could just be old and jaded. A strange little flick from a odd little decade."
1,Go Ask Alice,I hated that they choped it up so badingly. The book was a lot better. But that's just me.
3,Still packs a punch after all these years,"The book made a powerful statement in 1973 when I was 11. I had already read it (which scared the @#$%^ out of me for life) and putting a visual on those scenes haunted my imagination. The film might be laughable 35 years later, considering all the advances in acting and film, but the message is still clear. We thought it was a true story, but whether it is or not, the book packs a serious punch. I know it kept me (and the gang of girls I ran with) straight throughout my teens(in those raucous 70s!). I have students who are reading it now in a Banned Book unit. I still think it should be required reading-its message saved my life every time I was offered weed, speed, coke or one too many drinks. And Grace Slick's song still rings in my ears...."
4,FANTASTIC 70'S MOVIE!!,"WOW!! I CAN'T BELEIVE I FOUND THIS MOVIE ON DVD, LET ALONE FIND IT AT ALL. I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ALICE FOR YEARS AND STUMBLED ACROSS AMAZON. LEMME SAY, I'M IN MY 40'S & SAW THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IN THE 70'S. I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET, AS I JUST ORDERED IT TODAY, BUT I KNOW IT'LL BE AWESOME TO FINALLY WATCH IT AGAIN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. GROWING UP IN THE 60'S & EARLY 70'S, THIS MOVIE WAS THE BOMB BACK THEN, & I'M SURE IT WILL BE EVERY TIME I WATCH IT!!"
2,Needs to be remade,"I teach Go Ask Alice almost every year. Athough I show a few clips from this movie, I wish there was a better version that I could show in its entirety. The kids are always disappointed by how much the movie leaves out or gets wrong."
1,Horrible,"I read the book, and the book changed my life, but this movie is horrible. It cuts out very important events and people. I don't recommend it if you've read the book already..."
1,Go Ask Alice for a Better Movie,"This is a laughably bad made-for-TV movie from the early 1970's. The acting is REAL bad. Andy Griffith cannot help this and he's probably embarrassed to be linked to it. The movie takes its title from the Jefferson Airplane song ""White Rabbit"" and is sung by someone other than Grace Slick. The story is a well-meaning warning about the dangers of teenage drug abuse but it is a poorly done, almost incomprehensible story. I would guess ""stoners"" would find it hilarious. See ""Requiem for a Dream"" if you want a good story about the dangers of drug abuse."
3,The book is better,"I read the book when I was a young teen and the movie came out when I was the same age as the teenage girl in the movie. Fifteen. I admit drugs scared me probably partly due to the book. The movie isn't that good.It's about a dazed and confused middle class teen girl who used drugs to feel accepted by her peers. She gets hooked quick and hits bottom fast. The movie at about the middle shows her trying to get straight.The adults are not very sympathetic to her. She doesn't have a support system like NA to go to. When she gets in one, it's portrayed as being useless if not detrimental to staying clean. No wonder she starts using again.I watched it for nostalgic reasons. We sure looked shaggy back then. I had the long straight hair parted in the middle and pretty much dressed like she did. Instead of the floppy hat, I had a leather head band. Those bell bottoms were silly looking. I'm glad that when fashion makers tried to bring them back in the 90s they didn't succeed much."
3,"A polished, ""seventies-safe"" version of the book","I have read the book and seen the movie several times [I have it on VHS]. The book was incredible! I read in 2 days; it was hard to put down. The movie was typical of many movies made in the early 70's --censorship was big then. The movie didn't address/portray all the real stuff going on in the book. The book was the closest representation of what really happened in life. The movie was far from the book; since it was made for television, it had to be made ""sterile "" and ""safe"". I loved the movie because I love most 60's and 70's movies--but it needed to be closer to the book."
2,Really bad transfer of a 70's classic,"It was great to see this vintage film from my childhood. Sadly, the transfer quality is awful. The DVD looks like it was mastered from a Beta-max home video copy discovered under a rabbit hutch.I wasn't expecting an HD experience from a made for TV film 30 years old but it was pretty darn bad."
1,Go Ask WHO?,"I first read the book four years ago, and instantly I looked upon Alice as my idol. The diary entries gave me hope. So, when I finally got to see the movie a year ago, I almost cried. I saw no connection between Alice, and this pathetic attempt of a movie. It totally violated everything that had happened to Alice and turned it into a ""family"" movie, made-for-tv. I don't recommend anybody waste their time watching the movie, but i do recommend they read a copy of the book. It will turn anyone's head around, and most probably you'll never forget the book. I'm 16 years old, and i know I'll never forget Alice."
3,Go Ask Alice,"I bought this movie after i read the book in one night. I was so amazed by the book that i had to see the movie and see how other minds played out the charcters. I did enjoy watching the movie, however, i was disappointed by the acting and the way the plot was set out. It usually happens that you read a book then see that movie and there are always changes to the movie to fit all the excitement and adventure in 90 minutes. I think the directers might have taken the changes a little too far and almost changed the whole experience behind the book for me. I would recommend reading Go Ask Alice the book before seeing the movie, things will play out a lot better and make a lot more since if you read the book first."
4,Pretty Good,"This book was required reading when I was in high school, so I read it for the first time then. I enjoyed it so much that I bought myself a copy to keep, which I still have. I reread it recently. It's so realistic, makes you think. I never did any drugs growing up, but I knew plenty who did. The movie was alright, but the book's better. A lot was left out as far as details go for the movie. They should have put it all in the movie when it was done. It's worth watching, but the book would be my first pick."
3,Go Ask Alice,Nostalgic ABC afterschool movie from the 70's. Strong message. Show this to your 13-18 year olds and hopefully it will scare them enough not to do drugs.
4,Great TV movie,"Great for its time, great music, true to life situations, superior acting. Jamie Smith Jackson is missed."
2,not so much,"i was very disappointed with this movie, the book was so much better. it left out alot of parts, like where she was baby sitting in the end and got drugged by a 'friend'. it skipped the entire scene and went straight to the hospital, leaving you wondering what really happened. i guess if i had seen the movie first i might have liked it better though, but i recommend reading the book also"
1,Go Ask Alice,The sound on this video is off. When it plays it sounds like the speakers on my television are blown out. I do not have this issue with any other videos. I am unhappy with my order and it seems impossible to contact the seller to get a replacement.
2,THE BOOK IS BETTER,"I really was disappointed in the movie after reading the book. The book is much better. I guess it might have been different had I seen the movie before reading the book, but I really doubt it."
1,I've been had,I thought I had ordered the full version movie. I was sent the censored version. I wasted my momey.The movie I was sent was grainy and very poor quality.
4,Cabbage War,"This is essential viewing for anyone who has a loved one in aged care, or contemplating moving into care - it reminds you to keep a sense of humour, while telling a few 'home truths'about aged care. Pauline Collins and John Alderton are masters of subtle comedy."
3,What a name-dropper!,"I read this from curiosity about the relationship between the father and the son. The first third of the book, in which Larry observes his father and other spies, is fascinating. But the rest, pfui! Celebrity name-dropping, fawning over the wealthy (and never a concern about how they got and kept their riches.)"
5,So much fun,"So i'm 19, and i got this for myself...yup. it was so much fun to put together. The little yellow part on the head comes off easy, though. But it's an awesome toy ^0^"
2,Why can't Benni say NO!!!!,"Benni, as I have previously stated, is so annoying. Why can't she say no to anyone? Not at one point in the book was she doing anything for herself. She's always running errands, taking on extra work, doing favors, all for others, and it gets really old really fast. Not only that, I would like to take her husband and kick him to another planet. How many adults really act that way, especially the way he treated his new step-father? Just atrocious. And, the plot was weak, the characters shallow (really Elvia?) and outcome predictable. How often does Benni have to be almost killed before she stops doing favors for other people? I think this is my last Benni Harper book. I just don't care about her anymore."
2,Vintage Fowler but sputtering,"If you love Fowler, as I do, this new entry will give you everything you came for: familiar family and friends, a generous view of faith, a slowly spun-out mystery and her always witty dialogue. What's lacking is the emotional impact. Nobody really grows. Hud has lost his edge. Dove has lost her impact. Gabe has lost his mind! And the ending stretches all credulity. Hope to see better next time."
3,good continuation,It kept me reading but I'm not sure that anyone not familiar with this series would find it as enjoyable. Way too many references to previous novels with these characters.
4,Another Great Fowler Mystery,"""Tumbling Blocks"" is a good read if you enjoy California history and life style. Quilters also enjoy how Ms. Fowler works the block designs into her stories. I ejoyed the added trivia with ""Boo"", the new puppy and all that entails! I will say that this plot was pretty easy to predict, although it had some surprises at the end."
3,so-so book,"I was disappointed in this book. My family has been in the process of moving so rather than go to the library to get other books, I have been rereading the ones I already had. I read the whole series again and finished just in time to read Tumbling Blocks. ON the whole it was an o.k. book but it lacked the same spirit some of the other books did. Myabe when I reread this one I will like it better. I did like the resolution between Gabe and his mom but sometimes, he is such a jerk!"
2,Tired of Gabe,"I think I have read the last Benni Harper book I ever will. I got so tired of listening to Gabe moan, groan, and generally be a pain in the neck to everyone around him. The mystery plot was too thin and not really a mystery at all. Actually the series might be a whole lot better if Gabe were to disappear. He adds nothing to a book or to Benni's life other than a thorn in her side and mine.."
5,Deep and Fun,"I always love Earlene Fowler's book and her newest is not a disappointment. We get to explore Gabe's family and background a little more in this book, which is a nice shift from the usual focus on Benni's. I will admit that the mystery this time was actually pretty obvious. I normally NEVER guess any ending, but I could tell you what the answer was by about page 20. Not saying it wasn't an interesting mystery, just fairly easy to see. Elvia and Emory's baby should also add something fun to this series. I look forward to the next book to see more on this topic. I hope the series will continue to explore Gabe's backstory as well - maybe more on his sisters. I know I fell in love with the character of Becky in Kansas Troubles.This is a great book, especially if you are followers of the Benni Harper series, but even if you aren't this is a fun and enjoyable book. Definitely pick it up next time you are out!"
3,Not as good as others in this series.,"Benni doesn't need children, she has a husband who won't grow up. He acts like a bratty teenager way too often. Things seem to reconcile a little bit at the end between Gabe and his mother, but we'll have to see in the next book if he can really grow up and start treating Benni like a wife, rather than a doormat."
4,AN INTERESTING READ,"This was a very mystical read. It talked about things like withcraft, reincarnations, and sometimes Grant's descriptions of things were a little too grueling. However it was a good read and also a historical read that enlightended me about Renaissance Italy. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a good vocabulary and is ready for the breadth of emotions present in the book."
5,Spindle sander,"I am an interior trim carpenter so I have had a chance to put this spindle sander through its paces, and it performs great. Absolutely worth the money and being portable is a great plus in my business."
3,Tree Wrap for Bark Protection,"If it has good results we may rate it higher, but it is too early to tell. Hopefully, it will work."
2,Dearest Samantha,"Your ignorance clearly comes rushing forth in your rebuttal. I did not state that I personally read the book several times. However, some of my friends did. I elected to submit the summary on behalf of several others, which apparently did not cross your mind. You chose to jump to conclusions first without regard to the possibilities.Secondly, I commented on what I found to be positive (once again something that you chose to overlook) and then made the recommendation for the well read not to read it, not everyone in general. My recommendation to you, sweet Samantha, is to visit your local debate team and take notes."
2,"""A"" for effort but lacking in depth","James D. Jackson writes a good story but lacks in overall quality. This would be a great book for people just getting into the habit of reading, however, for those people who are well read, this story leaves you wanting more. The first three chapters use the first person narative for three different characters. Where that has an interesting perspective, it disrupts the flow of the story causing for the reader to stay confused or reread several portions to get the story straight. On a positive note, the story does a good job at developing the character's desire to fully understand themselves and their life problems. I do not recommend this book to well read people."
5,"Good book, Handsome Author",I meet this author at a book signing in South Dekalb Mall. He's much better looking in person. I wanted to take him home! The book was equally impressive and I also bought his book Wrong Perception. Can't wait until his next book comes out!
5,Awesome enlightenment,"As a recently divorced woman in my mid 30's, I picked this book up in wonderment and interest in the new sexual millenium. After reading Silk Sheets, I gained a level of respect for the lesbian and gay community. I can't imagine what it must be like to feel that being yourself is not acceptable. This book will definitely grab your emotions. As I read this book I realized that my having thoughts of lesbianism is and can be quite normal. Silk Sheets gives you a chance to see through the eyes of Tanya, as she goes through painful changes to learn and understand that being yourself is more important than allowing those around you to dictate who you are. The lessons in this novel are unlimited, not to mention the sexuality in this book is so hot and steamy, you can't help but be aroused! It will surely bring out that little secret within. I highly recommend this book so that we are all able to see alternate lifestyles through a clear lense."
1,Silk Sheets,"I was looking forward to getting this book after reading the reviews...too bad I didn't choose another. I found the way it was written choppy making it hard to read (or hold an interest) The dialogue didn't seem to have much effort behind it; childish almost.I finished the book, but only because I had nothing better to do while riding the subway.If you want to take a chance because of the other reviews, go for it- to each their own- good luck!"
4,Polyrythmic groove...,"Four stars because it's really good, not five because it' not earth-shattering or utterly incredible. All the best percussionists throughout the world get together and jam. Great variety of instrumentation, impressive, crisp production. Catchy grooves that can move your body or get you lost in the head. Either way it's an enjoyable ride. This one really grows on you. Excellent for road trips, making love, contemplation... Highly recommended."
5,Strong & Vibrant Heart Beat of the Planet ...,"Mickey Hart combines indigineous voices, chants, and traditional instruments with contemporary and shaminstic drumbeats to create a special CD very aptly named ""Supralingua"" ... which to me, means, super voices and super music. At times, add to this, the the sounds of nature ... for instance, drops of water or the ambience of the rainforest. Take the voices of the Gyuto Monks (Buddhist) mix them with the didjeridu, flutes, Chinese erhu, add a def drum beat, mixed in with metal percussion, cluster drums, and bongos ... all played by world-class musicians and you have an idea of track #1. This CD reveals a newly emerging creative path for music, showing us how traditional and contemporary instruments combine, to reveal an existence where the journey is never quite complete ... but is continually evolving. Listening to the CD is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"
4,A peak at prelanguage sound and Electronica,"Mickey Hart Serves up something very different again. This time bridging the gap of ancient and cutting edge ""tribal"" music. This sounds less spontaneous to me because of sampling. I'd like to hear an album like this all improvised in real time because I believe RAMU could shine in this setting, but you'll probably have to settle for a live show."
5,Easy to read! Practical advice.,This book was great for giving practical advice on how to manage your finances while you are also in the process of combining (or not combining) finances with your future spouse.
2,Newlywed basics,This book was not very informative. The sections contained a lot of what I thought was common sense topics that didn't need to be laid out in detail in a book. I have found that there are to many other better books out there for newlyweds.
3,Interesting blend,"In this book, first time novelist Tracy Sutterer blends an interesing mixture of genres (suspense, romance, paranormal) in order to bring us the story of Kincade Lewis - a DEA agent searching for love, but finding danger instead. Sutterer will be a writer to watch for in the future. Why not start now?Discover, THE CONTINGENCY OF POWER."
4,The Contingency of Power,"This book was imaginative, clever, keeps your attention as the story twists and unfolds. It has a nice touch of romance. Written with insight and power."
2,Stuff sack didn't fit stuff,I purchased the largest stuff sack after measuring my sleeping bag and thinking size wise it should be able to fit. When the bag arrive I opened it and followed the directions to stuff my sleeping bag into the bag - it did not fit (only half of the bag made it into the stuff sack. I was not impressed with the product and I am not sure what I will eventually use the stuff sac for.
2,Deff Not their best!!!,"This album sounds like a follow up to their first, as if the 2nd and 3rd had never happened. It's a real step back from the last 2, much cheesier, lotsa cliches(ie let's fu*k, lame or what!!). There are some cool sounds and they rock well but the 2nd and 3rd disc's are much much better!!!"
2,Slipping away.......,"Dopes 4th effort is not close to being their best. Yes I would say it is better than their first c.d. Yet this c.d. pales in comparison to Life and Group Therapy. The songs on this c.d. sound too similar to one another and all have the same message. f*ck everything. There are very few standout tracks on this c.d. and more than enough mediocre ones on here. The cover song of people are people is worth a listen but I can't say the same for f*ck the police. Oh well I'll give the c.d. a few more spins but I'm sure next week i'll be back listening to Life, Dopes best c.d. to date. Go pick that one up. And for a f*ck off attitude on a c.d. I would check out HED's new c.d. Only in Amerika which is way better than American Apathy by far."
2,Repeat!!!!,"Dope is a very good band. My only complaint is they keep releasing the same songs over and over again on ever album. I hate that! I'm debating whether to buy this recording. Come on guys, how about an album of all new material!"
3,"Worth the money, if your a fan","This cd wasn't bad. Not near as good as Life, but worth the $13 I paid. If your a Dope fan, get it; you won't be sorry. If your new to Dope, start with Life."
2,Fair resource book,"This book is really geared for Italian Americans, not Canadian Italians. Most importantly, the sources of info are out of date - now that that ancestry.com & other sites are available."
2,only highlights?,"i don't know if the other ""reviewers"" of this DVD have seen it or not (i have yet to), but the product description states ""including footage"" of the Final. This is not good enough, it needs to be the whole match, to really experience the pure drama and raw emotion of the game. i'm sure the DVD is plenty good, but not quite good enough. I, well, i'll be waiting for the DVD with the whole final on it, complete with interviews etc. I may well buy this one too, as it is the biggest night of my life as a Liverpool fan ( was too young to remember the European Champions of the late 70's and early 80's.)"
5,Not just for completists,"Sure, this is just a nine minute, two song single, but it's a darn good way to start your day off. ""Lost in the Air"" is a swooping, poppy version of the prog rock mined on ""Jupiter"" (and it sounds better here than on ""Antenna""), while ""Lift Off"" presents Brodsky's expressive vocals over a catchy space rock drone. It's the middle ground between pop and, uhhh, the opposite of pop, and a true cornerstone of Cave In's body of work, despite it's brevity."
3,One final Hydra Head release before joining the majors,"This could be considered a warm up for their major label release, and while this is good space-prog rock that they mastered on Jupiter, it's a little short. Neither of the songs will blow you away, but they are intricate, and maybe poppier then the last full length. Obviously a must for die hard fans, but if you are looking for first exposer try Jupiter or Creative Eclipse."
2,space rock for hardcore kids,"just listen to led zeplin and pink floyd goddammit!cave is not breaking any new ground here,they're just making ""rock"" thats OK for pretentious hardcore kids to like,who won't addmit to liking pink floyd.good bu not amazing,cool but boring.there you go."
4,Not over the edge but good,"Willie's unmistakeable voice is a crowd pleaser!One thing that striked me about this album was that it only had 11 tracks. I noticed Willie likes talking to a person a long time instead of making short cuts. His debut cd that I know of, and no cussing, and not hysterically and out of control comedy as the Jerky Boys 2 or 3. Willie showed great wit and improvisation in this, and I look forward to buying his other cds as soon as possible. Almost a 5 star, but not long enough running time, only 45 minutes."
2,not his best work,"this cd is one of his first originals ...the later cd's use bits and piece of this performance and enhance their character by using more ""redneck"" examples...but always a nice album to have in a collection..."
1,not what i'd hoped,"I don't have really high standards for the anime I watch, but this show crosses all the boundaries. I was expecting a lively, smart romantic comedy, but this show feels more like the dramatization of some thirteen year old kid's diary. It's about one third boring everyday stuff, one third whiny, sniveling inner monologues, and one third recap stuff, which is mostly just a transparent excuse for more inner monologues. Since the recaps are usually cumulative for the whole show, they just get longer and longer. Also, as the relationship progresses, the main characters get more and more obnoxious and arrogant, especially the girl. Why is everyone so amazed by this show? People should take some more time to think this over, rather than just jumping on the bandwagon and proclaiming the greatness of what is, at it's heart, a mediocre, half-hearted series."
5,Funniest and Best Animes Ever..,This is one of the best Animes I have seen in a long time. Most Animes I have seen I could watch maybe once. But not this one. I never laughed so much and totally loved all the people. I never wanted it to end. It has a lot of flashback but it's ok. Loaded with tons of funny scenes and reaction had me rolling with laughter for hours. The only let down was the aburpt ended which leaves you with screaming Nooooo what happen at the TV. I was totally adicted to this show.Please make another series.
3,They stopped caring about production halfway through,"I got His & Her Circumstances b/c of all the raving reviews. I really liked it up to the halfway point. The characters are good and so is the story. However, halfway through something happened, wasted time and a whole lot of nothing. This anime has incredible potential but falls way short. It's like a race car blowing a tire on the last lap of a race just b4 winning. I really want to love this series but it ends really lousily. Any more than 3 stars is misleading. Suzuka is kinda similar but done right all the way through. Watch it instead."
4,Great Anime With A Crappy Ending,"This was a great anime. It was funny, REALLY FUNNY, and I would've given it 5 stars, but . . . THE ENDING BITES. There better be another enstallment coming out, 'cause it ended too soon. I have the manga also, so I knew sorta what to expect, but when it ended I was like ""WTF!?"" How could it end like that? It really sucked. But, overall, this was a very good anime. It had a good storyline (2 overachievers fall in love with each other after discovering the other was a fake), it was really funny, the animation rocked, and I actually liked all of the main chracters. I don't regret buying this at all, despite it's ending. It's become one of my favorites animes."
5,The best water ever!,"I really like my bottled waters - and Badoit is at the top, the best by far. Where most carbonated waters are slightly hard with ""big"" bubbles, Badoit has a much softer feel on the palette and the carbonation is not as overpowering - (smaller bubbles) and the effect is awesome. Taste is great and the overall experience is highly refreshing.If you have the money to spare, I highly recommend!"
