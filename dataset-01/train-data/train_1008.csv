1,An excuse for Eickhoff to be an historic name-dropper,"I found this book to be very disappointing after having enjoyed his joint effort, ""Bowie, a Novel"", so very much. It wasn't the racism, about which I was duly warned; after all, it was set in a very racist time and the attitudes certainly fit the characters. No, it was the name-dropping that got to me. Eickhoff had Holliday hopping aroung the country meeting, and frequently bedding if they were women, many, many famous people. Names that come to mind are Belle Boyd, the Confederate agent, Mary Anderson, the Union doctor, as well as the Earp brothers. I just got tired of it and gave up on the book."
5,Beautiful,"Again, another beautiful addition to this gorgeous set of dishes! Just when I think I am done, they come out with another coordinating pattern that I just have to have! These are beautiful, the colors are bright and vibrant and a whole lot of fun! I highly recommend this set."
5,movie,I ordered the movie Outbreak for my daughter and her fiance. It arrived promptly and in absolutely worderful condition. I anticipate ordering more movies!
3,Great product but?,"I recieved this product and was up and running in 60 seconds, very easy to use.Drive is extremely fast ( at least on my machine ) and is the perfect size for on the go use, it is quite and generates no heat. One problem right out of the box was the usb cable won't stay plugged in the drive, very loose, if drive moved or bumped while working cable comes unplugged.Not a big problem for me as most work done at home but may be problem for some."
4,"Fast, Quiet, reliable if you fix the connector","As other reviewers mentioned, the connection comes loose easily. It doesn't just come loose, it pushes itself out. Problem is the rubber portion of the plug contacts the housing, and doesn't let the metal lock tab connect. I trimmed about a 1/8 of inch of rubber away from the metal portion of the plug, and now I have a very solid and reliable connection."
2,Save your money...,"Having just seen this mess of a performance on Trio, I'm glad I didn't purchase the dvd. If you watch carefully, you can see from Jimi's facial expressions that he is not happy with his performance or the band's or both. The band sounds unrehearsed, the playing is sloppy, vocals are missing. Jimi does try his best to salvage things with some interesting solos but that as brilliant as it was, can't save things. Some songs in very raw form- Machine Gun, are trying to listen to. Yet on the other hand, 'Red house' is quite good. Sound quality is nothing to brag about, sounds like an old 8-track transfer-raw. I wonder if Jimi would have approved of this release, based on the way he takes his guitar off at the end of the show and slams it down on the stage, I think not. The serious fan will pass this one up. Hopefully, the Hendrix estate will choose future releases(both audio and dvd)more carefully."
4,This video offers a glimpse of Hendix's genius,"Buy this video for two songs: (1) All Along The Watchtower and (2) Red House. On Watchtower, he uses his Fender Strat and it wails. Red House gets much more visceral with his Gibson Flying V. Red House starts slow and benign, then builds into great blues crescendo. He is awesome!"
3,"hendrix in a good mood , his drummer at this stage is lousy!","Anyone who thinks hendrix was deep into drugs during his final days are terribly wrong! 10 minutes into the video its very clear that hendrix is happy, healthy and talkative! In fact he's almost appears to be glowing. Let's face, Mitch Mitchell is the one who is out of it. I was sad to hear such a pitiful performance from such a masterful drummer. Seeing him slouched over his drums for the ENTIRE SHOW was dissapointing."
5,"Sizzling, searing hot sound-action; didn't it flip me!","If you've never seen this tape, please stop wasting time right now and go hot for it! Maybe Hendrix at this late stage in his career is not the ""wild man of pop"" he was two/three years before, smashing guitars, amps, going wild all over stage. But this is where there is the sound attack! From the time he climbs on stage sound-pictures start flowing off your small screen in a pretty mean manner! First you see Jimi talking to his axe, then the axe starts talking to you - it's absolutely impossible not to be blown into space!Hey, I been away from that video too long, writing this... let me dash back to go watch it again...."
3,As powerful as alays. . .but. . .,"Well, although Jimi Hendrix is as powerful as always, Jimi looks bored and tired during this performace. It's almost like he ""woke up this morning and found himself dead."" He looks like he's chewing something the whole time, and his guitar playing does not help. It's like he's forcing himself to do it one more time, but he really wants to get through it as quickly as possible. Okay, but there are a few good songs: Dolly Dagger, All Along The Watchtower, Red House and Freedom."
3,It's OK...but Blue Wild Angel is better...,"for YEARS this was all we had of Jimi's appearance at the Isle of Wight. It's a shorter, lo-fi version of Wild Blue Angel.Unless you lived with this version, and don't care otherwise, buy the newly released Blue Wild Angel DVD instead, it has MUCH better sound, and the complete performance. Well, almost complete. The CD has two or three tracks, like ""Hey Baby/New Rising Sun"" that you won't find here."
4,"One great show, one great man","I found the DVD version of Jimi - Live At The Isle Of Wight to be great. The picture quality is fantastic, much better than the laserdisc version. I was a little disapointed to see some of the tracks on this video edited. For example. Pieces of Machine Gun were cut to make it shorter. Also with Voodoo Chile, Slight Return. I was glad to hear All Along The Watchtower amd Spanish Castle Magic. These two tracks did not appear on the audio CD of this show. Over all it is a great buy if you are a Hendrix fan."
1,Disappointed,"I thought I was getting a great deal on a great product. When I recieved my bottle and sprayed it, I knew immediately it was different and I had received a knock off. The smell wasn't even close to the real thing which I still had a little bit of left. I put the two bottles side by side and could tell there were differences in the bottles as well. I may be nieve but I thought I was buying a genuine bottle of Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue. I was clearly duped."
4,bien,"todo bien ya fue recibido, y estoy satisfecha, y me agrada el producto, aunque el tiempo de espera fue largo"
3,Strange,"This product is strangely different from the ones I've purchased from deptartment stores. The packaging had a flocked blue paper, rather than the smooth blue I'd had before. The silver top tends to come off in my hand when I take the blue top off to access the spritzer - as if it hadn't been glued on correctly. And finally, there seems to be a slight difference in the scent itself. Just a note or two off. It's OK, but I think I'd go back to a department store to buy my next bottle, regardless of the Internet savings."
3,Pregnancies cause complications.,"A QUESTION OF PRIDE by Michelle Reid. Clea had been young and naive when Max Latham chose her from the typing pool to be his secretary and, later, his mistress. To Clea, it seems Max only wants her for sex. Then Clea becomes pregnant and discovers Max is looking around for a replacement lover. Max proposes marriage, stating he is ""fond"" of her. Intense study of the consequences from a love affair.THE STUD by Barbara Delinsky. When Jenna McCue decided to have a baby, she chose her best friend's brother as a donor. The coldbloodiness of the premise made it hard to get into the story.A LITTLE MAGIC by Rita Clay Estrada. In a moment of weakness, Marissa Madison and Adam Pierce tumbled into bed together. Then Marissa must contact Adam and tell him she is pregnant. Adam tries to take over Marissa's life, but can't admit he loves her. Adam's growth and Marissa's insecurities are also well-defined. A good story."
4,Great journal,Nicely laid out for recording home projects. Helps to look back and review time lines and when projects are due.
3,Home owner's journal,"The product is good but amazon put it together as a bundle with two other books, only one book was really needed"
5,Best ever,My husband loves this. I want to get one for every homeowner I know.. What a great way to keep track of repairs.
4,Love this Book,Found this book to be very helpful for recording facts about my house. I refer to it often for measurements and other info.
5,What A Tremendous Find!!!,"Now we can keep all of the details about our home in one easy to use book. It's perfectly organized to make record keeping a breeze. We're in the process of entering all of the data we'll need for future references. We're planning to give Home Owner's Journal to our friends who just moved into a new home in Auburn, California.Special thanks to Confluence Publishers out of Grand Junction, Colorado for providing this book. It's very helpful."
2,Not what I thought it was.,"This is more of a decorating book if you ask me. It gives you spaces to put what dimension e/thing in your house is. It is not a bad book, but it is not what I thought it was. I was looking for a book to store info on when the last time I cleaned the air ducts in the house, etc...stuff like that. Maybe I am looking more for a maitenence book. This book would be useful in many situations, but as a home journal it's not what i thought it was."
5,Quick and easy,"The hardest part to using this reminder (fill-in the pages book) is taking the time to write down what you did to your house. Be it painting-- the kitchen or replacing the waterheater. The book is user-friendly and the spiral binding allows to to lay flatt to easily write in. Virually all rooms, appliances, etc. are listed on separate pages. Referring back to finding an event is just thumbing thru the pages to the room,etc.Wall coverings; bedroom 1,2,3; measurements, cleaned by, brand, date purchased, costs,etc. are all things asked of you."
1,"The Home Owner's Journal, 5th Edition","This book is cheap and flimsy. It's totally devoid of color and there's only a folder flap (for paint samples, receipts, pictures, etc.) on the back cover. Otherwise you're just supposed to ""attach"" fabric swatches, paint samples, appliance info cards, etc. on the pages within the book. So make sure you always have a stapler or tape when you're using if you want to add anything.And if you want to house all your appliance and household manuals in this book, forget it. It's way too small and they wouldn't even fit.I purchased for a housewarming gift and it's so cheap and un helpful as a resource, that I might not even bother to include in the package. I'm very disappointed. It looked much better on line than in person."
5,Very necessary,"Had heard about this book years ago, and kept saying I was going to the bookstore to get it. Very happy to find it at Amazon."
3,Oh no...,"After reading some of the pages in the preview, I realized it's not the original version, but a modernized version of it. I really wanted the original."
2,Lacking current information and mistakes,"If in search of a map with current and accurate information, this one is of questionable value. For instance, out of Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas it shows an autopista towards Raudales. This doesn't exist. Want autopistas which exist that are not on map? Try Uruapan to Ixtapa, or most of the route from Mazatlan to Tepic. Other flaws also on this map."
1,Perma Grip,This is one of the worst products that I have ever purchased.For the price that they charge a coustomer for this it shouldat least hold for an hour. I will never buy this again.Amazon sells good products but this is not one of them.
2,Not like the product I remember,Imagine my disappointment when I tried the product thinking it was the same product I used before. Not near as effective and Poligrip powder does a better job
5,correction,"This is my favourite elvis costello album. Just would like to correct previous reviewer in his revision of history, re elvis' appearance on SNL... (and you can verify this on the best of SNL CD.) He goes into Less Than Zero, stops after a couple of bars and says ""I'm sorry, there's really no reason for us to play that song tonight"" then goes into Radio Radio. not to be picky, but keep the legend alive by getting it straight. jeesh!"
5,His masterpiece enhanced by second disc,"This second album by Elvis Costello is far better than My Aim is True, in my opinion. The tunes are more immediate with much more of a pop flavour whilst the music is also more rhythmically varied and compelling. It marks the transition to his wonderfully accessible Armed Forces masterpiece.There is even a reggae beat in (I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea and a ballad with lovely piano - Little Triggers. My favourites on the original disc are the up-tempo Pump It Up, You Belong To Me and the poignant This Year's Girl, plus of course the pulsating Radio Radio with its subversive lyrics. Night Rally is somewhat dark and disturbing.The second disc includes a wealth of previously unreleased tracks, demo tracks, live and alternative versions. Not all of these alternate takes are as gripping as the familiar versions but they are certainly interesting and worthwhile, demonstrating various facets of his extraordinary musicianship."
5,Any Year's Model,"This Year's Model was Elvis Costello's second album and his first with the Attractions. Mr. Costello embodied the angry attitude of punk rock, but unlike most punk bands that were unskilled musicians that thrived on energy, he has an unbelievable sharp pen and a great ear for melody. The album opens with the fierce ""No Action"" that in fine punk form clocks in at less than two minutes. ""This Year's Girl"" is wry take on the fame machine. ""The Beat"" has a catchy organ riff and is Mr. Costello's look at self-gratification. ""Pump It Up"" is a fiery track as is ""Lip Service"". ""(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea"" has a manic verve while ""Little Triggers"" slows things down. ""Radio Radio"" is the most famous off the album, but the album's best track is ""Lipstick Vogue"". The song has a thumping bass line that shuffles along until a frenzied close. This Year's Model gave further proof that Elvis Costello may well be the king."
4,"Great buy for newbies, the live shows the selling point here","I'll only comment on the concert recording.Good,sometimes suprising seperation and arrangments.The band sound like they just discovered, or were slipped some speed.Almost worth buying for people who have both US and import LP's and 3 different Cd versions already. Man, its starting to suck being middle class."
1,Travesty,"By far, the worst treatment of Yes music I have ever heard in my life. Steve's son must really hate the band to have done this."
2,max headroom's favorite yes bits,"To be fair,Virgil Howe does some things with these songs that would lead me to think he got some inside tips from his dad.This is worth hearing.Once. He uses a delay feedback stutter on every song,so you get cool takes on Yes songs ruined by the abuse of an outdated audio trick. I think if Virgil had done this CD at Langly(his dad's studio),it would have worked.Sorry."
2,"opportunity wasted, experience forgettable","I must agree with most reviews that this remix cd pretty much sucks. I to am a fan of electronic music and yes and this did have the potential to be great, its just so damn uninspired and for the most part boring.I can appreciate howes son for attempting such an experiment, the fact of the matter is that he was in way over his head. Oh what the chemical brothers could have done with this!"
1,Remix this,Why didn't I read the reviews before buying this? Any kid with a Mac and Garageband could do this crap in his sleep. Avoid this at all costs - it cost me 19 bucks.
5,Delightfully surprised!!!!,"Bravo Virgil! First, to enjoy this Remix album you must be a diehard Yes fan or very much into a Moby dance remix style. Virgil must be a Yes fan because he remixes parts we know so well while maintaining the beautiful parts in Awaken, and the riffs that have made Yes legendary. Listen to Tempus Fugit completely and you will see. Bass riffs in ""Heart of the Sunrise"" are well preserved and remixed. The piano in Awaken is somehow just as beautiful as the original. It is Yes music but Virgil respectfully interplays all the parts while maintaining his own artist fervor. And the tribute ""No Clowns"" which is actually an overview of all of Yes' kicking songs, is excellent. I highly recommend this CD to anyone. I know Yes music so well that it is refreshing to hear my favorite group's songs redone with grace and integrity. Great! Every song is a familiar surprise!!!My best to Virgil!!! You have a new fan!!!"
1,Huge Dissappointment,It was my fault for not listening to the track selections on Amazon before purchasing on another site. This is the biggest piece of junk every produced by Yes. I was a huge fan in the early years and was looking forward to this compilation. Now I'm stuck with it.
1,Shame on Yes,"I have to say I am incredibly disapointed that members of Yes sanctioned the release of this awful CD. It seems obvious to me that it was little more than a bone thrown to one of the group's children in an attempt to make a few easy bucks off of unsuspecting Yes fans. The CD is, in a word, garbage. Pure and simple. I warn anyone out there duped by the band's logo on the front of the CD cover to listen first to sample tracks before purchasing. I made the mistake of trusting that Yes would not allow something this bad to be released with their approval and I therefore bought the CD blindly. BIG MISTAKE. This product is so bad, you can't even read the liner notes inside because of the way they are printed. Absolutely terrible. Shame on you Yes!!!!!"
1,No,The single star is for having the guts to release crap like this. Second only to the Re-Works rubbish filed under the Emerson Lake and Palmer banner. That one is even more painful to listen to and that's saying a lot.I tend to believe that this whole remix thing is a bunch of nonsense. A pathetic attempt to squeeze more bucks out of bewildered fans. Enough is enough.
1,Can you say burglary!,"Well folks Yes is my favorite band, and I am willing to pretty much by anything that come s down the pike that bears there name on it. This CD is horrible, re-mastered songs compiled and remixed by Steve Howe's son Virgil Howe. If you're looking for something similar to the mid 80's release of ""12 inches on Tape"" your surely going to be disappointed. One thing you must understand is that I also love techno music, so I was quit excited to see a Yes CD that was sure to have a techno edge to it. ... To describe this CD, put your favorite yes song into a CD player and press the pause button on and off real fast and once in a while press the fast forward search button and finish the insanity off buy pressing the rewind search button. Oh one more thing, I immediately through this thing in the dumpster after one listening, would not even waste another red cent mailing this back to rhino records with a letter of complaint."
4,Not for every yes fan,"Look guys. There are two requirements for liking this CD. One, you must be a Yes fan. Two, you must be as much of an electronic music fan. I realize that to be fans of both is rare. But for those of us who are, this is an excellent piece of work."
4,Yes Gets The Remix Treatment.,"After being together for 35 years, the vetran prog-rock band Yes has finally gotten their own remix album. Some people may balk at the idea but, the end result is quite stunning.The entire CD was assembled and remixed by Virgil Howe (aka The Verge) who is the son of Yes guitarist Steve Howe. The Verge gives some classic Yes tracks the club-dance treatment adding DJ cuts, drum loops, samples and manipulations to the original tracks. This CD is a perfect gift for the older Yes fan to give to their children. There is a definite bridge to the generation gap with this album.Some die hard Yes fans may find this album to be disgraceful and mutilated. I personally can't get enough of this one and I've been a Yes fan for exactly 20 years now. The only complaint I have is that some of the newer material from the '80s wasn't given the remix treatment for this album. Apart from that, who cares? ""Yes Remixes"" is a fabulous and interesting listen. Check it out for yourself."
2,Rough and disjointed...,"As a fan of both Yes and electronica, I think I can give a relatively informed an balanced review. And, that having been said, I'm a bit disappointed. The first song (Tempus Fugit) gets great treatment, and sounds good, probably because the original lends itself to a bit of electronica. As the album progresses, though, the songs become more disjointed the remixing less... appropriate.I tried to think of how the remixes played off the themes of their originals -- Yes songs are packed with quick changes of instrumentation, tempo, and volume. But, it all works in that way all Yes fans have come to appreciate. Similar changes in the remixes, though, don't flow as well. Rather, I found myself wondering if ""The Verge"" was trying out all of the possible features of his new synth.Ah, well, I'm sure I'll return to a few of the tracks once in a while. But, when I want to listen to Yes, I'll listen to Yes, and when I want to listen to electronica, I'll listen to electronica."
1,a stinker,"if you really want to hear the true beauty and magic of james carr, get the goldwax singles - this is beautiful singing, but hidden behind horrific music - programmed drums, cheesy guitar - the worst. avoid this one."
4,An Exotic Escape,"I really enjoyed viewing this video and will keep it in my large collection of dance videos. With the exception of the Turkish Dance, which was over edited, all of Hilary's performances were complete dances that were smooth and enjoyable to watch. Never having the opportunity to travel abroad, I especially enjoyed watching the various middle eastern and scottish cultures scenic highlights that were incorporated into this video. Very professional video and I would recommend buying."
5,This looks fun,"I had a pogo stick that reminded me very much of this one. I really liked pogo sticking on my old one, but after I did 3000 jumps, something happend to the springs. I was devestated and began to look for another pogo stick. This is the cheapest and best one that I can find. I would really recommend this to anyone who is looking for a durable and long-lasting stick. I also recommend the Flybar 1200 that is also posted on this site. I don't have enough money to buy it, but Amazon has the cheapest price for the Flybar I have found. Highly recommended! (By the way, how does a pogo stick have educational value?)"
2,Way too heavy and hard to manage,"No way, it was too hard to manage, none of us could stay on it. This is definitely not a child's toy and would take a strong, very coordinated adult to use. It sat in my shed for most of a year and then I just got rid of it."
4,Re: book Reiki for Dummies,"The book was rated very good, but upon arrival there were defects. The seller responded quickly and refunded the shipping cost which impressed me. I would buy from her again."
2,"Love the movie, but","Love the movie, but it had too many starts and stops in it. Didn't finish it! Much too irritating to continue to try to watch!."
4,Fun to watch,I love to watch old musicals so am a pushover for them.Betty Grable and Dan Daily are two of my favorites.
4,Heart warming story,Old movies may be shmaltzy but are great because they don't try to take a position and be politically correct. This is a sweet film about family and the want of children to make the family complete.
3,Betty Grable wants babies,"This movie is has a star studded cast, but Batty Grable is just plainblond chubby. They have color TV 8 years before Mary Martinand NBC did Peter Pan. So this musical although with a goodscript, musical numbers and cast is just doomed to bea second rate one. I enjoyed the movie anyway seeing it for the first time,but the results are still critically bad due to castingand faking the TV shots, so that they looked noting like 50's TV.Most of America couldn't afford TV for another few years...and it was definitely black and white."
3,Grable at her best,"The four movies that compose this volume, answer perfectly for what one expects from them: entertainment, pure entertainment. For when a volume 2 of Betty Grable?"
3,Movie Buff!,"I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE SIMPLY BECAUSE I LIKE THE OLDER STARS, AND MUSICALS, BUT MAINLY BECAUSE IT WAS DIRECTED BY HENRY KOSTER, WHO ALSO DIRECTED ""A MAN CALLED PETER"". I WAS HOPING FOR THE SAME QUALITY DIRECTING, BUT I PERSONALLY DID NOT SEE THAT. IT IS AN ""OK"" FILM, BUT I'VE WATCHED BETTER. THIS IS MITZI GAYNOR'S FIRST FILM ROLE, FOR YOU OLDER MOVIE BUFFS. I DON'T CHALK IT OFF, EVEN WITH MY COMMENTS ABOVE!"
5,great product,"this has got to be the greates little dvd player going,allso you can plug your game system into it,i love this thing.....ron"
1,Please don't buy this!,"I got it to put my Graco Snug Rider car seat on it. Despite of the fact that I carefully followed the directions, it never worked. One of the pieces, supposed to snap in place, never did. I called Baby Trend customer service three times, and three different representatives I spoke to were unprofessional, discourteous and completely uninformed about the product features. I returned the stroller to Amazon (very easy process), and fortunately my refund was processed in a prompt way.Since I returned it, I have checked out several of these strollers with babies on board, and none of them held the car seats properly! I got the Graco Snug Rider carrier, which is a breeze to assemble and feels very solid. What a difference $10 more can make!"
5,Very good,Great progressive release from a band that I had never heard of until I read about them. I decided to give them a try and found their music to be great. You can pick up this CD for very cheap. You will not be sorry. I also found out that they broke up for several years and recently got back together and made a new CD. I'll get that one next!
3,Slowest 40 years in physics in the last century,"At the age of 20 this book is a classic:The ""Halo"" dark matter of figure 6.2 has only lately been confirmed by observation. Dark matter particles have really not yet been observed.String and SUSY theories so young and hopeful in this bookhaven't born any other real fruit either?The result is that this book has become a classicwith the omega function becoming a part of cosmology.More and better observations haven't yielded evidence of an great difference between the worldand the ""Standard Model"" of physics of the late 70's.No really successful grand unified theory, no observation of the Higgs particle to confirm the mass symmetry breaking field ideas. Comparing the 40 years 1928 to 1968 to the years 1968 to 2008 and you get a near voidin physics."
4,Fun summer reading,I was looking for some light summer reading and this book was it! I also was intrigued by the title and was looking for a series to start. I read a lot and wanted something that was not so deep this time. This book was very entertaining.
3,Not what I expected,I was put out by all the long winded descriptions of clothing. I guess that was one way to fill pages in a book so short.
3,A bit disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book - especially after reading the previous reviews that said it had mystery, humor, and ""snappy dialog"". I wanted to like the main character, Helen Hawthorn, and I did, until it was revealed that she was running away, not because of some bogus criminal charge against her, but because she didn't want to give her ex-husband any money! Helen had to be tough to go against a court order and run off but here she is complaining and whiny.Several of the secondary characters are interesting, especially Helen's landlady, Margery, of the flamboyant purple wardrobe, and sensible, intelligent Sarah so I might try the next book before writing off the series."
1,waste of money,"i actually read this first one and then the second in the series-just to be sure i really did hate it. you know you're in trouble when you skip, not just a page, but page after page, in a murder mystery. i kept thinking what an idiot this helen woman is. i don't even want to waste any more time with a review but-i like a good murder mystery...this wasn't even good ""fluff"".....as a st. louis native living in florida for many years, i really wanted to devour these books......i'd rather eat sand."
4,best book i've ever read!!!!!,"thos book is amazing! i like murder mysteries and this book had several murders , one, after another and thats what i like. but if your someone who doesnt like murders or to many murders with the details then this is not the book for you."
2,No mystery about it...,"A terribly dull, disappointing plot with a main character who doesn't seem very bright. Why is she on the run when a good lawyer could solve her problems back home very simply? Why does she make silly decisions when she knows she's in danger? The ending was also flat and unsuspenseful."
1,not worth the time,I read all the reviews and thought it be a fun read. It was not at all funny. The writting was ok it just did not live up to the reviews. Save your money and read another cozy series.... like Nancy Martin Donna Andrews or Joan Hess....... at least you will laugh.
5,A unique blend,"of shopping in a snooty, upscale Boutique and watching CSI.The main character, Helen has traded a lavish lifestyle to working in a clothing Boutique named Juliana's in Florida for minimum wage. The door always stays locked and is only opened for the rich and beautiful.Helen discovers that Christina (Juliana's Manager) has a special relationship with each customer. She refers the best plastic surgeons, knows how to immigrant housekeepers and the perfect hit man.Things turn sour when Christina is found floating in a barrel in the bay. Her customers are mournful, but more desperate to retrieve their secrets that Christina was holding. It's up to Helen to solve the mystery.I knew that this would be a great read when I saw that Jane Heller called this book, ""Irrestible, a heroin with a sense of humor and a gift for snappy dialogue"" since Heller is one of my favorite authors.If you like Heller's collection, you will love Shop till You Drop."
3,Not What It Was Cracked Up To Be,"Helen is hiding out from the law and taking any job she can that will pay her under the table. Her first job is at an exclusive clothing store that caters to the highly fashionable of South Florida. Just when she decides her boss is doing some illegal stuff, she vanishes, only to turn up dead. Can Helen find the killer before her past comes out?The book is advertised as a humorous mystery, but I only laughed on the last page. Not because it was over, but because I finally found something truly funny. I think part of the problem is that the narration often seemed more detached then it should have been. The story was interesting and I liked the character even if I thought Helen's reason for being on the run was rather stupid.I'll most likely give the series another chance, but this book didn't live up to my expectations."
1,Problem for public use,"We first purchased these staplers for a busy academic library for our patrons' use. The first year they were terrific. This past year, every single stapler broke by the third day of use. The loading device has a small plastic nub that is critical for the proper functioning of the stapler. That nub broke in every single stapler. We duck-taped the loader and got more mileage from each stapler that way but the whole situation was very difficult. It is an example of a great product that went wrong through a cheapened manufacturing process. This might be ok for your desk, but for public or heavy duty use, avoid it."
1,"You'll be ""In a Jam"" if you buy this stapler!","This is NOT the heavy duty stapler that it is advertised to be. It jammed the first time my wife used it (granted, she goes through staplers like #2 pencils, but that's why I spent the bucks to get one that wasn't, supposedly, flimsy). The irony here: it has an ""anti-jam"" mechanism! And worse, there is no way to open it from the top to remove the staples! Or maybe there is, but it does not come with directions! I had to pry them out from the bottom with pliers.Further, the staple-feeding cover on the other end is nearly impossible to open, OR close. So it fails at both ends.Redeeming quality: it is very nice looking and rugged. As a door-stop, it will probably last forever."
3,"Great stapler yet, poorly made","The stapling functions are great. Lightweight, easy to use.After a few months however, the loading spring part broke. As one of the other reviewers, the plastic nub that holds the loader piece in place, broke.It's a great stapler, just be gentle when you refill the staples. I've rubber banded the piece to stay in place!"
1,Suggest you remove this stapler from your list,"Stanley Bostich Personal Heavy Duty Desktop Staples with AntiJam Mechanism, 60 Sheet Capacity (PHD-60)I would suggest that you remove this item from your list. The stapler does not really have anything close to a 60 page capacity. And when it does work for smaller items, the piece of the machine that is supposed to hold the staples pops out."
1,90% mangled staples,I purchased this about 4 months ago and missed the deadline to return it (2 month return window). This stapler mangles about 90% of the staples I have tried to place in documents.It doesn't matter how many pages 2-30 - this stapler doesn't work. How annoying! And expensive.
5,Guardian Angels,"This little book shows just how much our Guardian Angels love us. They watch over us like a patient Mother. We should try to remember them more often, because they are always with us. My favorite part of this book is the section in the back devoted to prayers to the Guardian Angels. Especially the Novena prayer! For Christmas, think about putting this in a stocking over the fireplace."
2,Not that hot; not worth the $,"Reading all the reviews, I was pumped for this product. I love hot sauce and make a lot of very spicy food. I grow hot peppers and have a fridge door full of different hot sauces.Upon arrival the little eye dropper was intimidating. I poured some salsa into a bowl and daringly added 3 drops and stirred it in. I started eating the salsa with chips and I couldn't feel the heat at all. I added another 5 drops, stirred it in, and then i would only call it 'moderate' heat. All the reviews had me thinking that just a few drops makes a whole pot of chili spicy. 8 drops in a small bowl of salsa was not very impressive.I guess if this stuff was only $5 - $10, i would have given it a more positive review. But $35!? it does add heat without any flavor, but nowhere near what i was expecting. My wife put ate a drop a chip said it was nothing even close to the likes of Dave's Insanity or Da Bomb hot sauce. she didn't even break a sweat.Save your money."
1,Fraud,"I have just received this product and find that it doesn't come close to meeting the claims made on this website. There are warnings about using rubber gloves when handling the product. I intentionally applied a couple drops of the product to my skin and ... NOTHING! No burn, no heat, no pain. I put a drop in a glass of water and it floated on top. I stirred it and drank a little. There was a very slight burning but I've had Chinese food that was a lot hotter.Another unusual observation. This liquid is dark brown in color. I have extracted the juice from a bag of Habanero peppers using a power juicer and the liquid was clear and at least a hundred times hotter than Pure Cap. If this is pure capsicum extract, why is it brown.My advice is to stay as far away from this product as possible. I have totally wasted my money.I have always been very happy with my purchases from Amazon but this product is a rip-off."
5,Love this iced!,"This is one of my favorite iced teas! I drink it straight with no sweetener, it doesn't need it. A great alternative to water. It's hard to find in stores now, so I appreciate that I can still find it here."
4,PRICES ARE GREAT,"the tea is fine, the delivery company not so good. They had it on the truck for 3 days!!! I tracked the progess and just kept waiting.your price by the case is 1/2 the price of supermarkets, when I can find it."
5,Real Raspberry Taste,"This is the only raspberry tea that actually tastes like plain raspberry. No other flavors mixed in to ruin the taste. Because it is caffein free, and I love my caffein, and I love the taste of black tea, I make a half and half iced tea using this and plain orange pekoe and pekoe black tea. And because I am from the midwest, I like my tea sweet. NOne of this California unsweetened tea for me. So I use Splenda of Equal to sweeten it. Another great way to make this is as an iced tea using half raspberry and half Bigelow Lemon Lift tea."
1,Nora Roberts at her worst,"I am a great fan of Nora Roberts, her romance and mystery romance novels. She is one of my favorite authors. Don't waste your money buying this book. Bryan Mitchell and Shade Wilder are both professional photographers. They know of each other, but have never met. Life-Style magazine hires them to drive across the United States, taking photographs of America as they go. Except for a couple of interesting side incidents, along the way, and many pictures taken, they spend most of the time arguing or not talking and watching the scenery go by. They gradually fall in lust, and then in love. Then, they have to decide if the want to be tied to one person on a long term basis."
4,Very good book,"I found the book good, It was a strange beginning and strange ending... Other than that it was a good read"
2,One Summer,"not one of Nora Roberts better books, wouldn't recomend it. It was very long winded no great deeped to itOne Summer"
3,One Summer,"Not one of Nora Roberts' best, but good for a die-hard fan to read as part of her collection. I've always thought that Ms. Roberts must be a conglomerate--some of her books are so excellent and some are such formulaic tripe. Also, she has at least three distinctive styles. Writing as JD Robb, she has yet a fourth style. And she is so prolific--surely she doesn't just write 24 hours a day?"
5,"Great book, should be the second in the series","This is a great read by Nora Roberts. She always tells a story with such clarity that you are immediately drawn in by her characters. This book is another that you will thoroughly enjoy, however, it should be read as the second book in the series, not the first. While I do not want to spoil the book for readers, the characters in the second book ""Second Nature"" come into play in this book and you will already know too much about them to enjoy the second book if you read this one first.So, read them in reverse order: Second Nature then One Summer."
3,One Loooooong Summer,Each few chapters repeated the previous except for location. Was very disappointed because I love Nora Roberts books.No excitement. Formula driven. Not much more to say about it.
4,One Summer,This is another excellent book by Nora Robeerts. It's a wonderful love story. One of her best. I hope you all enjoy is as muuch as I did.
5,Nora Roberts new Series,"Being a Nora Roberts fan, I can't say anything bad about this book. It's a typical love story, no threats or violence in this one. Loved it! Can't wait for the next one to come out. Thinking a trip to Boonsboro is in order, just to see the town she's writing about."
3,One Summer by Nora Roberts,"I always loved Nora Roberts' fictions. Her stories are usually written very well. I had not anticipate her making a mistake like one I have seen in this book. There is a reference about a old woman watering pansies in her garden in Oklahoma. Well, pansies do not glow in summer. They love the cool winter weather. By April, they have to be removed for upcoming spring/summer flowers. Unfortunately, the reference to the pansies were made more than once. It really bothered me. It remind me that this was just only a fiction. I am not sure what the editor was doing not to pick a mistake like this. For the electric version, it can be swapped with ""periwinkles,"" which thrive in a hot summer sun."
1,NOT ANTI-FLAG!!!,"This cd is not a release of Anti-Flag, it is an unaouthirized reproduction. It is an insult to the band, and to sum it up: It sucks. Poor Quality, bad selection, and no enhancements."
1,Sucks,"Anti-Flag is a really good band and I personally like every one of their cds, but this one? No. They didn't have their permission to make this cd and plus it's 4 songs for 10 bucks in stores. It's a rip, it sucks, it's short, and you should not get it."
1,Not a real release - Do not buy,"This CD was illegally produced without the band's permission or support and it shows. You are better off buying any of the other albums or waiting until March 21 to buy the new Anti-Flag album ""For Blood and Empire"". I just heard the new single ""press corpse"" on KROQ and it is awesome..."
4,"Kepp in mind, the CD is old and live....","Anti-Flag is one of the greatest modern punk bands, still holding true to the punk spirit. The only reason this album gets a 4 out of 5 is becuase it is live, and short. I do not reccomend buying this CD only becuase of the way in which it was released and recorded. HOWEVER, the entire CD is posted at the fan site www.thepeopleunited.net. If you feel you must listen to it, then I suggest getting it here."
4,"GOOD, not great","The previous review said that it was not enhanced, well thats true because its LIVE at the FireSide Bowl. its not recorded in a studio, its LIVE. this is a good cd, two tracks that are not on other cds."
5,Kipper is IT!,"What can I say? I a world populated by violence and nasty examples of bad behaviour for kids, Kipper is a breath of fresh air. My 4 year-old adores him and his innocent and friendly adventures. Kipper is a charmer, his little ""dramas"" are simple and easily resolved, an absolute winner. Highly recommended!!!"
3,"Weird, but okay movie","This guy is completely obsessed with a self-centered, over sexed, beauty. The worse she treats him the deeper he goes. What he does to her is pretty twisted, or is it? Crazy movie."
4,Boxing Helena/1993/2001 DVD,"There is allegedly a commentary track from the original Laser Disc if you can find it. It may help to explain a few things about this unusual feature. Make sure to avoid the claustrophobic Full-Screen version, and see the the 1.85:1 Widescreen format the way it was originally designed to be viewed."
2,Item is a bootleg and import.....,I was very disappointed in this item when I received it. The case is written in another language which you really don't see when you look at the small photo on amazon. The main menu of the DVD is poor quality and skips and was obviously made by an amateur. It also has Korean (?) subtitles as the default (but can be manually turned off each time you watch the movie). The movie itself is of a watchable condition but very disappointed that these things were not more visable on the Amazon listing. This was a Christmas gift for my husband so I was a little upset about the quality of it.
3,An interesting idea,"I saw ""Boxing Helena"" because I'm such a fan of director David Lynch and it had been directed by his daughter Jennifer, plus it stars ""Twin Peaks"" alum Fenn and the director of photography worked on the series as well. While technically proficient, the film is terribly flawed by occasionally hammy performances by everyone, especially Sands and the inexplicable Bill Paxton (yes, he is in the movie, though he may never admit to it), and additionally by terribly stilted and unoriginal dialogue. On the plus side the film deals with some fascinating ideas, such as the border between love and obsession and the notion of the 'boxes' that we put ourselves in emotionally. The ending will come as a bit of a surprise to most, and it helps if you view the entire thing as a fable rather than a realistic portrayl of a story."
3,Chopping Helena,This movie is so weird...This guy falls in love with a woman named Helena and will do anything to keep her...and when I say any thing..I mean ANY THING...It's kind of long and drawn out and then a surprise ending..Check it Out ..U might like it.
1,"A little of inside wind, a lot of atrocious acting","My best friend is a mad Lynch fanatic. As part of her completist attempts, she made me watch this movie despite it being made by a Lynchie offspring and not the main man himself. I'm a big fan of Sherilyn Fenn ever since her turn as Audrey in ""Twin Peaks"" and Julian Sands in ""The Killing Fields."" After laughing through most of the love interest sequence, the ridiculous attempt to mimic Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" fountain scene, the ludacrious wind that seems to monsoon the inside of Sherilyn's bedroom, I have to conclude that this was one of the worst movies ever written. I have to ask WHY exactly did the Enigma soundtrack was chosen? (...) history and Bill Paxton screaming hysterically in the last scene, there is no reason to watch this movie than for camp, high camp."
1,A DUD!,"First and only time director Jennifer Chambers Lynch (daughter of David Lynch) tries following in daddy's foot steps, the result is a faulty misfire of a movie without an ounce of quality or value. To add insult to injury the performances are just as bad as the direction. Passing on this script and project was the best thing Kim Basinger ever did. Was it the director's fault, the actor's fault? Well maybe. But I think the whole promise was a bad idea."
1,Simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I went into this movie expecting to like it, because I was familiar with the bizarre premise and thought it would be edgy and compelling. Instead, it was slow-moving, terribly miscast (especially Bill Paxton as the hunky bad-boy sex-machine lover of Helena) and had one of the cheesier soundtracks I've ever heard. A complete waste of time (and I don't say that often.) Bill Paxton and Julian Sands, both fine actors, undoubtedly cringe when they look back at their decision to add this movie to their respective resumes."
3,Middle of the Road,"I agree with the many reviewers that said this movie was very poorly scripted with a barely believable plot. However, it was like a train wreck: you can't look away, especially when Sherilyn Fenn begins to lose a limb every other scene. Just bizarre! Julian Sands' acting left a lot to be desired, although it may just have been the script. Sherilyn Fenn, who plays Helena is absolutely beautiful and did an okay job, considering that her character didn't have much dialogue, other than to scream at Julian's character, Nick, every 5 seconds on ""You make me sick! I hate you! You did this to me!""All in all, it's not a great movie and would never be up for any kind of award, but if you're looking for an unpredictable and dark movie, this one will fit the bill."
3,Just Odd,"Julian Sands notwithstanding, this is a very odd movie - lives up to it's director's name (Jennifer Lynch is David's daughter), but something's missing - very near soft-core porn."
1,Lamo Movie,Saw this back around the time it came out but recently I watched it again and it is one of the worst movies of all time! Do not buy unless you plan to watch it with the sound off...
2,Pressman Stricker Pro,"I purchased this game to use in a Dementia unit.We have found the darts are hard to attach, they often bounce off or hit the metal and fall off.When I ordered this toy I had been looking for some time for a magnetic dart board but was unable to find one."
2,Disappointing,"I suppose it's a matter of taste, but I think Swing Parade is the worst Rifftrax I've seen to date. The movie itself is excruciatingly boring. The Stooges aren't funny in this. The best Rifftrax comments seem to be in the beginning and mostly at the end. The bulk of the middle of the film is painful to watch. I guess we can't hit a home run every time."
3,A MATTER OF PERSONAL TASTE,I only watched one comedian. He was just so-so funny for me. Stand-up comedy is a matter of very personal taste.
4,Great show,"Hilarious! I have seen this many times and it's still funny. Heck, I have most of his jokes memorized somewhere in my noggin. RIP Mitch!"
2,Kevin Brennna,Kevin Brennna is not that funny as he has been. I think the reasoning is this is a 1999 video and the material is just not funny.I suggest picking newer shows for comedic relief
3,A Matter of Preference,It was fine - not my favorite but a comic on her way up. Some of the same cliche material I hear from others but a spark if the individual world view comes to the fore.
1,Elements (15 volume set) by Brian Knapp,"Elements (15 Volume Set)This product is advertise as a used 15 volume set for a very low price. I only received one book for the price, not the used library set advertised to order. I tried reaching company, no response. Not sure why Amazon does nothing about this matter when bought on their site. I am a science teacher in need of the complete set."
1,Item was canceled,I was so excited when I found this set because it isn't published anymore and we needed a replacement set for my high school library. I was then so DISAPPOINTED when I received an email from Amazon indicating that the order had been canceled with no explanation as to why.
1,Elements (15 volume set) Purchased on 01/12/2010,"I have recieved only 1 volume of this 15 volume set so I can't review it. Also, I haven't been unable to find a phone number to contact the seller or Amazon - Very unhappy!! We have had to change the cirriculum due to these volumes not showing up.Highly disappointed in Amazon for not monitoring their sellers better.Terese Jeppson"
1,Save your money,This product tastes nothing like butter and is a waste of money.I contacted the seller and he said he only sells the product and doesn't make it so I should contact the manufacturer.Nice way to run a business. They are totally protected and never will ever take on any responsibility.Beware.
3,way to expensive,these mints were good but not worth the price i paid plus the ridiculous shipping not really for someone who is looking to freshen their breath more like an overpriced candy and who really wants that
4,Cute toy,"My friend gave this toy to my one year old for her birthday. It makes the cutest sounds! It's a great idea for a toy, it's three puzzles in one. Even my five year old likes to play with it. My one year old just pushes the cubes to make the sounds but my five year old can do the puzzles. I love the sounds too and don't get tired of hearing them like other toys that have sounds. The only reason I gave it four out of five starts is because we have only had this toy for a few weeks and the paper stickers that are covering the cubes are already starting to peel off. My baby wants to tear them off so I have to keep sticking them back down. I will probably have to use some glue to keep them down. Besides that this is a really cute toy!"
2,Ehhh....,"This toy is okay, just okay.It makes cute sounds, but there just isn't enough to it to keep a kid entertained.If you can get it at a good price, then do it, if not I would pass."
2,These Whispers are Not Much Fun,"A number of characters in this movies are sexually disturbed, and it is a matter of guessing which one of them is a killer. I won't give away the plot, but, somewhat predictably, none of the patients are guilty. And the real killer documents his crimes on tape so diligently that you have to wonder if this detail is an intentional insult directed to the audience. The movie is occasionally sexy, but unfortuantely, some moments are also nauseatingly grusome. All in all, this thriller is neither that thrilling, nor exciting."
4,"Hey, it's good. Honest.","I don't know why reviewers were so harsh with this film. It was interesting and entertaining, and it kept me quessing, even though the other contributers on this page gave away the ending without warning of ""spoilers."" I recommend this film when you are not in the mood for the latest ""critical success/oscar contender,"" preferring instead a nifty little mystery. It gets points also for having a straightforward ending, and not one of this twists where you go ""huh?"""
5,ANOTHER GREAT BOX SET FROM A LEGENDARY COMEDIAN!,If you are a fan like me this box set and the first set are essential! I like this set better as I have seen the earlier ones many more times. This is Classic Carlin!
2,cheap!,This liner is really thin and doesn't even stick very well. Once we got it onto the shelves I placed my ceramic bowls on the shelf and slid it over and the liner ripped. I will just stick w/ Target! this was a waste of money
4,"SNAPPY 1930'S HARDBOILED, GENTLY SKEWED","If you like humor with mayhem, hardboiled and ""closed community"" ""golden age"" mysteries this melange of a funny novel is for you. PI Bill Crane goes undercover at a lunatic asylum (well, OK, it *is* a high-class joint, and they don't call the patients lunatics but ""guests"") to solve a theft and guard an old lady, and then people start dying.Terse hardboiled-style writing, well done, a fast read. Seems as though the writer is quite tongue-in-cheek about the PI conventions - a running gag is that the PI gets beaten up at least once daily, and he has a great time poking fun at this premise. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, but can't give 5 stars because I feel he has better stories in him."
5,Great supplement,"This is a great supplement to have with you if you are studying/reading the Philosophical Investigations by Wittgenstein. Much of the Investigations is easy enough to understand, but this text by McGinn clarifies some of the tougher ideas present in Wittgenstein's work. For a book that is already hard enough to read all by itself and get the most out of it, McGinn's book is a great guide to have along for the crazy ride that is doing philosophy with Wittgenstein."
1,Cheap board,The game is fine if you don't mind the fact the the game board is a cheap cardboard stand up. With the weight of the game pieces it sags horribly in the middle. Pay a little more and get one with a real game board
3,Classic Chinese checkers,"The game is as ever Chinese Checkers. Six players can play at once and jump each other to make it across the playing board. As for the board its made out of plastic and offers a color coating for the marbles and each side where the marbles sit. I will have to give this game a plus for its durability, because if you can find a child that can destroy these plastic marbles enter them in the Olympics! Speaking of the marbles, children can swallow them easily so if you have small children, keep this away from them!"
5,A classic game,"I have Fond memories of playing Chinese checkers when I was a kid. Now that our children are old enough to learn and enjoy hours of fun with this classic game, I could not pass up this purchase. There are different ones out there made of different materials, but I liked this one because it reminded me so much of the old set that I had. Great colors for easy recognition as well. I only say that because I have noticed where some people have complained with other sets that the darker, space age look of some boards make it a big more difficult to see the marbles. Pleased with the price as well as the timely delivery. The set comes with instructions and a full set of marbles for up to six players. I would rather my children be learning to use problem solving skills and strategy from something like this than escaping into a video game that portrays the needless killing of human beings."
2,Great game lousy set,This set is cheap cheap cheap. The board is flimsy and had to be taped together when we got it and the marbles are light and not real marbles. The game is still great but it was very frustrating for my son since every time he touched the board they all moved. Ok who am I kidding it was frustrating for everyone involved!!!
2,Bad quality,"well, no where in the page said it's a cardboard make. it's really cheap and the center sank a bit because of the weight of the game piece, creating the slope. And hence the game pieces are easy to roll toward the center. Also, the plastic pieces just don't stay quite well on the board. It's lame."
3,"Fun family game, poorly made","At $6, I am pretty sure I overpaid for this.Chinese checkers is a fun game, and children as young as four understand the rules and can play independently. I was glad to find a cheap version, but it is cheap in price and manufacture. The game board is cardboard, and will most likely not last a year in the hands of any but the most careful child. The marbles don't stay in the holes when the board is moved, and there are exactly enough marbles to play, with not a single extra.I am glad I purchased the game; it's a good learning board, and now that I know my family enjoys it, we may invest in a better-quality game when this one inevitably becomes unusable."
4,"Slightly cheap quality, but a great game","The game itself is great without a doubt. I view this as a lighter version of playing chess, still requires strategy and thinking, but not quote as much as chess. As for this particular product, the construction quality is not the best. I guess the price should have been indicative of that. Any how, for the price it's decent."

3,A legend in her own basement,I got this CD from my friend in Denver. Clunky production and a lot of lyrical self-pity. Seems like someone with issues and arrested development.
2,scratches easily,"The watch is very nice however, the metal scratches very easily. I've had other watches, all different brands and none of them scratch like this one. Spending as much as I did on it, I'm afraid to even wear it! Not sure what kind of metal this made out of but it is very soft and you may want to think twice about purchasing this watch."
2,Crickster,"Big Screen and everything looks great with this DVD player. But after three four days, it failed to play half of the dvds. Also, the one it played. it kept skipping every few seconds. For the price around $244, you can buy much better things then this DVD player.The Mintek quality needs much more improvements.."
2,Ok B Movie-but LeBlanc makes it likable,"This movie is not so great. However, Matt LeBlanc is comes off as his usual likable, adorable self and so you're not cringing the whole way through."
1,Possibly one of the worst comedies...ever,"O.K., our P.E. teacher made us sit through this hour-and-fifteen minute load of junk one day during class one day. Let me say I only enjoyed the movie slightly because it beat being fried in the boiling heat outside. First of all, the plot has so many holes in it I seriously think that someone held the script up to the wall and shot twenty rounds at it. Secondly, I believe I watched an episode of Teletubbies once and laughed more then than I did during this movie. Finally, the movie is more bland than a block of tofu. No action, no drama, not the slightest trace of good humor."
2,Total disappointment,"I am so tired of taking my children to see what seems to be a harmless ""kiddie"" movie and then have to sit through something vulgar and tasteless. Don't be fooled by the PG rating, this movie side-steps the profanity restrictions by using a lot of ""double entendre"" sexual references. Also, I was a little impressed by the antics of the monkey until I realized it was only a man in a monkey suit. Don't waste your money on this one unless you enjoy explaining to your kids what ""spank the monkey"" means."
1,Too bad monkeys *didn't* make this movie...,"Jack ""Deuce"" Cooper (Matt LeBlanc) is a minor league baseball pitcher who's got the goods, but no self-confidence. Instead of looking up Dr. Phil, the team manager decides that a simian teammate is just what strike-out Deuce needs for a boost. Enter Ed, a chimp who's got more talent in his elongated little finger than the whole team put together. Ed's antics, including scarfing down chocolate-covered bananas and pulling toupees off of bald heads, were all ""aped"" by men in monkey suits and animatronics. Unfunny slapstick makes this DVD a real strike-out.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,"Annoying, Kiddie, The worst movie I've ever seen!","Everything about Ed is terrible! The sound fx are worse than a low cost skit show. King Kong looks more realistic than Ed. It is SO obvious he's a robot! Ed also has a weak, flimsy plot."
1,"""ED""it All","Matt LeBlanc slums it in this stupefyingly amateurish, artless, awful and awkward baseball movie. Who knew how much Joey needed his Friends, and who knew Joey also went to Ross' tanning salon? Who thought this would be funny?"
1,Wrong title,"The correct title for this book should be ""Robert Penn Warren's All The King's Men Monarch Notes."" This is NOT All The King's Men."
1,Don't Buy This,"Landmines is a collection of unfinished songs and b-sides slung together by Jeff Gillespie for his new record company, from which the band gets nothing.As Ginger himself puts it ""don't buy it kids, but if you've gotta, only one of you buy it, the rest of you buy a good quality chrome cassette and copy it""This should have 0 stars 'cause it's a total ripoff!!!"
5,love it,was 7 when this was on tv but it mad e an impact because at 26 i still bought it when i watched it it brought me back when tv was not all sex and violence which tahts fine if your an adult but this shott livee show is a must see
5,Eerie indiana: the complete series,"i bought this collection because i never did get to see the entire serieswhen it first aired. It was kinda neat to see all the campy goofiness thatwent on. i found the DvD to be in good quality both in sound and videoand it had the 1 feature i do like ""play all episodes"" nice feature if you don't want to keep clicking the ""back to the main title button""."
4,eerie indiana,"If anybody thinks they have been short changed with the region 2 version of EERIE INDIANA,then this seems not so, as the episodes which appear to be missing,Jackalope, Miss Perfect etc. are from a Canadian programme called EERIE INDIANA REVISITED, which has not been transfered to DVD.The region 1 version has the same number of episodes as region 2.Forteanfan"
1,snooze ville indiana,"this is more of a kids series. was disappointed and cant even finish it. borining, fall a sleep tv. cant believe i paid that much for something so boring,."
4,Watching Eerie Indiana,Watching Eerie Indiana was like taking a trip back in time. I very much enjoyed the product.
4,life in stone.......hiphop's building material,"To put this simply..""GO COP THIS QUICK!!!!"" It is an underground gem that doesnt deserve to be overlooked. There is a wide range of material on this so everyone will find s'thing they like on it. They seem to have a winning formula that shines on every track. There is 7 tracks that are nothing short of ""perfect"" and they are ""soldierfied"", ""its over"", ""what if its true?"", ""l.i.f.e."", ""fever"" (my personal favourite), ""resist"" and ""skeletons"". Then you have another 6 at least that are damn close, which are better than most other bands ""best joints"". I swear, after being blessed enough to catch them live in DUBLIN a few months back(with arrested development and spooks) i knew they were dynamite. Dont let this album pass you buy. Great production, as you would expect from any quannum release, and mc's in the same vein as ""gift of gab"" from blackalicious you can only expect a bomb!!!!!"
4,4 1/2 stars,"Lifesavas really live up to all the hype (being the newest artist on the Quannum label, one of the first Portland groups to really make noise across the country, etc.) and then some. They come with innovative, head-nodding, infectious beats (provided by Jumbo The Garbageman, Rev. Shines, Blackalicious' Chief Xcel and Rev. Shines along with some live musicians), multiple flows and styles, dope punchlines, mad metaphors, inventive concepts I've heard in a long time, (Hellohihey is the best songs I've heard in a loooong [explicit] time) and even a some hilarious skit or two thrown in for good measure (if the Thuggity Skit doesn't have you laughing out loud, check your pulse). I definitely recommend this album for anyone who likes either of the first Lifesavas singles or fans of groups like De La Soul, Blackalicious, Latyrx, Abstract Rude, J-Live, Aceyalone, Boom-Bap Project, Pep Love, or just appreciate good music in general."
4,The best REAL Hip Hop album of 2003!,"This is what Hip Hop is all about. Lyrical Challenges, B-boyism, Political messages, and even comedy! Vursatyl and Jumbo (the garbageman) clean up the trash with the best lyrics on any coast since ""Blazing Arrow"" in 2002. In addition, Portland's unique and diverse style of beats are represented well on ""Spirit in Stone"". This album is appreciated by hip hop heads of every style because there is undeniable talent here. You have that talent, with the real life messages (Resist, reminincent of Bob Marley's Stand up for your rights""), add influences of Gospel, Reggae, blues, R&B over some amazing beats and you have ""Spirit in Stone""! In the end, even the Lifesavas can't save lives when the competiton is left dead!"
4,Impressive verbiage,"I found this album after hearing a remarkable song on the radio one day. Several lines lept out at me, and after googling ""bittersweet is the compassion of a psychopath,"" I found the lyrics ""Livin Times"" from this album.Over better-than-average beats, I found a mind-boggling density of concepts that makes the most of hip-hop as an artistic medium. Sure, you could just talk fast, or repeat the same thing over and over (What? Okay!). But you could really express your identity and worldview - if you have one.The writing tickles the same fancy that makes reading a very literate book so much fun. But unlike Lolita, I can dance to this.Overall, the album is a little hit & miss for my personal taste, which probably means that some but not all of the songs will appeal to a wide range of people. Individual tracks can be bought - they're on e music. And best of all, there's a new lifesavas album out in April so look for that!"
5,Much Better Than Tuna,"I like it much much better than tuna. I've had it in salads, hot dishes, straight out of the can and I love it (for canned salmon recipes see the company's website). I don't mind the skin and bones at all because you can't taste them, but when I'm preparing it for others I just mash the skin and bones with a fork, leaving the bigger chunks of meat intact, and nobody has ever noticed them. The delivery is always quick. I also appreciate the recipes and the postcards with the message from Pre Alaska Salmon Co included in the package. It feels good to always have a few cans of Think Pink tuna in my pantry."
1,Not the al-tuna-tive,"I was hoping that it would be an alternative for canned tuna, but it isn't. The can was full of skin and bones (and salmon meat). It was like they threw the whole fish in a shredder and then canned it. They didn't even remove the backbone. After trying for a while to remove the bones and skin, I just gave up and threw it out. Maybe I got a bad can? If not, you guys need to open a can of tuna and compare product."
5,Great book for Moms looking for healthy recipes,"I received this book as a gift, and was pleasantly surprised by the content. I was assuming that it would be another mainstream recipe book (as another reviewer noted, there is nothing on the cover to let you know it is full of healthy ""hippie"" recipes). However, there are 30 or so pages of good nutritional advice and then scores of great ""alternative"" recipes, covering breakfast, snacks, drinks, soups, entrees, breads, and desserts.Please note that if you don't like whole grains or 'whole food' ingredients or 'weird' vegetables then you won't like this book. Also, you will need to be able to get to a health food store for many ingredients... but if all of that is right up your alley, they you'll love this book."
1,What the HECK?!,"Plain and simple. I ordered a beautiful guitar and received a thin paperback book titled, 'The Cat Who Loved Christmas'. Upset? yes Angry? yes Completely and utterly confused? ABSOLUTELY!"
3,Good music,"The music in this CD is good. Is what I expected, but for the first song. Was like a reprise of ""Masquerade"". One of the most emblematic songs of Goerge Benson suddenly stops at a little more than 3 min and I expected to enjoy the talent of Benson in this song, but it doesn't happen. However, the CD is still good."
5,george benson greatest hits of all,the best of his collections all on one cd the best kick back driving music to your ears enjoyed it 100%
5,TJ's Review,"George Benson is Soooooo good. Every song on this album will blow you away.The Man is a master. Buy it, snatch it up. Do not miss out !!!!!!"
3,Who am I doing now?,"Scat singing George Benson often performed other people's songs in other people's voices. His vocal on Leon Russell's ""This Masquerade"" for example is a Stevie Wonder impression. Although ""Give Me The Night"" isn't a cover, George is clearly doing his best Lionel Richie here. And is that a touch of Michael Jackson creeping into ""20/20""?Benson is at his best with instrumentals, particularly ""Being With You,"" a song that showcases his abilities. Even when playing however, George is occasionally imitating. The ""Breezin'"" guitar sounds very much like Wes Montgomery, while ""On Broadway"" is reminiscent of the guitarwork from ""Shaft.""Maybe this should be called THE GREATEST IMITATIONS OF ALL. (3 stars)TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 76:51"
3,Used crappy short versions instead of long lp versions,I love George Benson very much he is one of the Jazz greats that are still alive and kickin. But I don't like this album because on Masquerade and On Brodway they used the stupid short versions instead of the LP long versions and since these songs were 2 of his biggest hits it made no since to me. I get sick of GREEDY record companies putting out stuff like this and tarnishing A good name like George Bensen. But there are some great song on this and its a good package job...................
3,I'd give this CD 5 stars if....,"...it included the full version of ""This Masquerade"" and ""On Broadway"". It's as if the songs are cut off. Kinda disappointing. But overall the CD is okay and is still worth buying."
4,Some of Benson's best,Good album for Benson fans. Cuts across his years of entertaining with a nice slice of his music.
4,"Very good album, but there are at least two songs missings!","I recently saw George Benson perform at the Newport Jazz Festival - it was a perfect day with great weather and scenery. I love this compilation to bits, but can someone tell me why ""In Your Eyes"" and ""You're The Love Of My Life"" are not included?"
5,ONLY THE BEST,"cop this album now. Its one of my favorites along with Word of Mouf, Back for the First Time, and Speakerboxxx/The Love Below."
1,Keith Davitt is NOT a co-author of this book,"My rating is not directed at the book per se, but rather at Amazon's description of it, which lists Keith Davitt as one of the authors. I have a high regard for Davitt's work and purchased this book in anticipation of seeing his contributions to it. Mistake."
5,"Better than ""Bang the Drum Slowly""","The first Henry Wiggen novel is the best of them all. While not as well known as Bang the Drum Slowly, which is its sequel and which certainly deserves the praise it has received, The Southpaw is a wise, touching, and very funny book about a young man's coming of age in post-war America. All of the big themes of American life are here in a short, first person novel written in dialect (so hard to do well, here so effortless) about a young pitcher's journey to the major leagues -- race, class, ambition, envy, fame, friendship, love. All treated deftly, and with good humor. Finally, Henry Wiggen is as fresh and attractive as any character in recent American fiction. Read all of the Wiggen books, but start here."
4,Highly enjoyable and humorous,"I truly enjoyed this book the more and more I read it. I am a baseball fan so I definitely got caught up in the pennant race, but what captured my imagination was the essence of the story. The story features characters and events and descriptions that just feel so real and they are in the eyes of Henry Wiggen. It's strange that Henry gives us all this information and details of his early baseball career, but yet he needs to figure out what is really important in his life. I commend Harris for fabricating a story that felt genuine and did not cheat the main character by straying off the plot which is to be about Henry Wiggen. I also appreciate the breaking down of the baseball mystique of its players - reading about Sad Sam Yale and Dutch made me realize even more how far baseball players really are separate from heroes."
2,Book Shows It's Age,"As an avid baseball fan but a first-time baseball novel reader, I was disappointed with Southpaw. I didn't think twice about when the book was written (50 years ago) when I bought it. As I read through, the age of the book was obvious; not because of the style of baseball described, but because of the laughable simplicity of the characters. Some will rejoice that this book takes us ""back to the good old days"", but if you're looking for a more realistic novel of the game with thrilling twists and turns of a drive for the pennant, this book is not for you.Also, if you know little about baseball, the book will be hard to follow when it describes game action."
4,HELL of a debut!!!,"WOW!!!Kymani's first major label release is a home run!!! great tracks on here!! "" the Lord is my shepherd""is a true classic!! check it out! sure he sounds like Bob but he has the hip hoppy attitude with a sense of humor. Papa would be real proud!!!"
5,Very Helpful For Westchester Commuters,"After reading this book, I am convinced that Joshua b. Issacson is a god among men. It is the best piece of literature I have ever read in my entire life. Not only did this book make me cry tears of joy, but I have dedicated my life to making sure that the people of westchester never have to be caught in traffic ever again."
2,no bio,"i guess it is all right to review a book i didn't finish ... i just didn't like this book. i have read several biographies of historical figures of this era; this time i was looking for a little 'softer' interpretation of eleanor of acquitaine, something along the line of 'the lady elizabeth'by alison weir. this book, however, seemed trashy to me. the author's inclination to include sex scenes in a way that reminded me of so-called 'historical romances' seemed out of place. if you want to read a good bio of eleanor ... stick to alison weir."
2,"entertaining fiction, not history","Marion Meade's book is indeed entertaining, and paints a vivid portrait of Eleanor of Aquitaine--one that many readers have complained is missing from other biographies of this most fascinating queen. The problem, however, is that a substantial proportion of that portrait is conjecture, built out of an uncritical examination of literature and legend. Do not think that after reading Meade's book you will come away with true history. For a truer, less romantized account, read Amy Kelly."
5,"Historical or Not, A Great Read","This was a wonderful book. I would read as much as I had time to each day and then spend time thinking about Eleanor until I could get back to her story. I have read other accounts, one historical, of Eleanor of Aquitaine, but this one brings her to life more than anything else I have read about her. She truly was a remarkable person by any standards and Meade made me feel as though I was right there watching it all unfold. I would highly recommend this book, particularly, if you have not read anything else on Eleanor and I guarantee you will want to find out more."
4,A decent chase,"While the book does feature the F-22 depicted on the cover, it's really a B-story subplot that doesn't seem to really involve the Fericos at all. However, it does continue the unofficial series that DeFelice's works fall into with the reappearance of President Jack D'Amici and ties in the HOGS trilogy he wrote as James Ferro by revealing the ultimate fate of BJ Dixon."
4,An Ending with a Twist,This is a good read keeping in mind that it was written before the fall of the Soviet Union. The events just prior to the conclsion were surprising in that I really didn't see it coming.
3,I knew it is not for me.,"I already had the Chinese-calligraphy counterpart of this book. I just had to purchase this, too, even I did not expect much.The book presents a brief history and the basic set of artist's equipment - two rating stars for that. The technique is also introduced but I recommend specialized texts instead. Only the dozens of pages concentrating on kana writing (both hiragana and katakana) were of some value as a model reference (thus +1 more star). Anyway, the project suggestions like seal carving or painting on a t-shirt are nonsense.In general, this decorative book attracts one in a hurry to find a gift for someone else. I cannot recommend it for any other purpose. The same applies for ""The Simple Art of Chinese Calligraphy"" by Qu Lei Lei."
2,Not really useful,"This was the 8th manual in my library I have for running my NWN module and it is the worst one so far. I really didn't find it as useful as I though it would be. I needed it for the 3rd edition gods and really, it doesn't give me any more info then the 3 primary books (DM, Players, Monster). In fact, It seems to contradict them a bit. I shouldn't of purchased this book, it really will just rot a bit. For a module designer who's trying to add deities in to their NWN module, its really not worth it."
2,deity statistics,"This book did not present the pantheons in a very loving fashion, but instead used most of the pages for the pantheon presentation for statistics for deities. Most people would never use these statistics in their games. You will not get a good feel for the pantheons in this book. Steer clear. look into ""Faiths and Avatars"" and ""Book of the Righteous"" instead."
3,"Bon livre, mais ...","J'ai trouvé ce livre très bien, assez de détails sur les dieux et avatar de chaque dieux D&D CoreRule.Mais pourquoi les deux des Pharaons ? et pourquoi les dieux de l'antiquité ?Ce livre aurait plus tre beaucoup plus court, ou encore avoir plus de spell additionnelle, et moins cher, mais sans ces Panthéons, qui sont tant qua moi inutile."
3,"Three Parts Divine Spark, One Part Mortal Ascension","A good resource for the divine in your campaign. The rules on how to create a deity, while quite good, are lacking in some areas (such as how to determine a deity's ability scores), but the examples given in later chapters will help you through most snags. This book fits in very well with the new mantra of options and choices. My only real complaint is that they used the Egyptian deities over the Celtic deities."
4,"Good Book, But Not v3.5 (If You Care)","This is a really good book if you want to know some background/details on many different D&D deities of many different pantheons. However, I only gave the book 4 stars because it is pre-version 3.5, so you will have a little work to do if you want to use any of the deities' game stats. This is only a small problem that can be fixed, and the flavor it can add to your game makes the book worth it in my opinion. Also, the section on creating deities, while not v3.5 friendly without some changes, is also very useful."
2,As others said- limited in scope,"I can't give this 5 stars, nor even 4. I can't do half-stars, so it's 2.5 for me. Certainly fun to flip through & see all the stats, but as someone who started off with 1e. AD&D;, it was a letdown to see so few cultures represented.Heh- they didn't even *bother* doing one for 4e., so it'll be interesting to see if they do for the up-coming ""D&D; Next"" 5e. I'd hope they greatly expand in the cultural department if they do."
1,This is an UPGRADE - not full product!!!,The item description does not make clear that this product is an upgrade. Do not buy unless you own an earlier version of Acrobat for Mac!!!
1,YET ANOTHER DULL TV MOVIE.,"""Sunstroke"" is the type of mystery/suspense television movie that you have already seen hundreds of times before. It's what is referred to as ""filler"". Its sole purpose is to take up space on some poor channel's schedule. The way they represent the city of Scottsdale, AZ is absolutely laughable. It might as well be some sleepy little town of a few thousand the way it is presented here. The plot involves people being killed and we are supposed to be concerned as to who is doing it. Unfortunately, you are never given any reason to care about any character in this whole film. Trite, boring and predictable...stay away!"
3,Morality of Rock and Roll,I work in a Faith-based substance abuse treatment modality. This dvd collection has been both controversial and educational. There are areas of the film where it is a bit overzealous and reaching to align data with the beliefs of the pastor / presenters but overall it is quite useful for reflection and discussion.
3,10 hr set vs 3 hr dvd,"I have the 10 hr set of they sold their soul for rock n roll and I recently bought this 3 hr version so I could have more dvd disc to share with people. I liked the 10 hr set better because it had the major 60's and 70's band on one disc that I could let friends and coworkers borrow. The 3 hr dvd seemed very preachy and I wish it had more facts about the bands and kept the preachy stuff for the end of the dvd. It would be nice if the dvd had a menu option by bands. It just seems that if your trying to convince someone that music is bad, then you would want to present the music band facts first while the person is interested in watching and then present the scripture info and extra side stuff. With this 3 hr dvd I'm afraid too many people will turn it off while waiting through the scripture info, discussions and extra stuff that's not band based facts. I wish the 3 hr dvd discussed the Eagles and their Hotel California song like the 10 hr set."
5,Very eye opening. Don't believe it. Your in denial!!,Better than Hells Bells 2 documentary and that one was great. This one touched on more subjects.Common sense is what tells you this video is a no holds barred look on what goes on in the music industry. If this was a video about eating foods that were bad for you no one would scoff or object and most people would wholeheartedly agree. Yet when it comes to being careful about what we digest with our eyes and ears people seem to to think there are no consequences to our choices.
2,A disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I purchased it because I LOVED the movie ""Sorcerers of the New Age"" that Joe Schimmel did. In that film, he backed up all of his claims meticulously with video footage from interviews, concerts, and quotations from books.In this film, Joe Schimmel talks in a stupid, overly excited voice the entire time. He takes quotes out of context, and I even noticed that one picture he showed had been doctored. The movie was corny and just plain STUPID. If I hadn't seen other documentaries on the topic of secular musicians being possessed, I would laugh this movie off and go listen to some led zeppelin.If you want to see a good movie on the satanic nature of rock and roll, watch ""Sorcerers of the New Age""."
5,Hilarious!,"For anyone who likes to watch stuff like this just to laugh at how stupid some extremists can be, this film is the absolute king of the crop. It's great to put on and laugh along with your friends at how absolutely clueless these people can be - hilariously twisting everything ever recorded into an obvious endorsement of bloodthirsty perverted satanic death worship. Somehow even John Lennon's line of ""If you're talking about destruction; don't you know that you can count me out"" is revealed for its true satanic intentions. Good Fight ministries seems truly dedicated to making conservative Christians look like ignorant morons. So get out yer popcorn and get ready to listen to some records backwards! ;DAnd if you don't want to help support such an ignorant group by giving them money, you can still get a laugh anyway - this is widely available for free on youtube and google video."
2,Did he go off the deep end?,"First off, let me say that musically this CD has a few nice things to offer, which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. But in addition to some of the hackneyed synth lines (which I won't go into since other reviewers have covered this well), he writes lines like: ""Bullets for the brains of the atheists"".So let me get this straight, Roland: Atheists should be KILLED???Is this some weird kind of Christian tough-love or has he simply gone insane? And there's no getting around this hateful line either: no one can claim this is somehow metaphorical because he precedes the line with ""Hey now read my lips"" and he then repeats it.Anyone who wants to spew hatred can do it without my financial support. I'm not even an atheist and this offends me deeply."
1,Apalling,"I bought this album because I had heard that it was essentially a Tears For Fears album in everything but name. That much is true. The music is as good as anything that TFF produced. Were that the end of the story, I'd give this album a good rating. But...The one thing that ruins this album is the song, ""Bullets For Brains"". It's a song about murdering atheists. If there is a positive sub-message in the song, or if it's meant to be sarcastic, it isn't at all apparent. Why Roland Orzabal would write such an apalling song is baffling. Musically, it sounds good, but it's like listening to a racist song just because it sounds catchy. It's definitely not something you want your kids listening to. It definitely deserves a ""Parental Advisory"" warning sticker. As far as I know, Orzabal has offered no explanation for this song. I think he owes the world that... or an apology."
5,Powerhouse Music From A Powerhouse Musician,"I think what I like best about Roland Orzabal, and this holds for his entire career from TFF through now, is his interest in and command of all shades of the modern music spectrum, from hard driving modern rock to pure, fluent lyricism. He's not married to a signature sound, and this curiosity and sense of adventure is evident in every song. Maybe that's what keeps his output so fresh. Even a longtime fan such as myself was taken by surprise by the currency, the now-ness, of Tomcats Screaming Outside (I ordered the import some time ago, not knowing if it would ever be released stateside).I hope this CD receives the attention it deserves. Perhaps people are ready to get serious about music once again. In any event, good music tends to find its way to appreciative ears. Save yourself some time and find Tomcats before it finds you. This is groundbreaking music from an accomplished artist."
4,strong work,i was a bit skeptical that this would be relevant material after so long a hiatus but in fact i agree with the others that this is some of his strongest work to date. sure to please old fans and likely to garner a few new ones as well. it's a remarkably well-crafted album that is likely not to get the attention it deserves.
3,Not what I thought I would get,"After reading all of the reviews about this album, and being a die-hard TFF fan and one who truly enjoys Roland's voice in song, I was quite disappointed with this album. ""For the love of Cain,"" was the best song on there out of about 3 that were ok to listen to. The others were grating on the ears, and I found myself enduring them, and not enjoying them. This album seemed to be a bit of a mix between Roland's ""Elemental"" and ""Saturnine, Martial, and Lunatic"" album with more electronica mixed in. Sorry to say I don't really recommend this album to those who like the jumpy, tune heavy songs of TFF past. Do yourself a favor and get the new ""Everybody loves a happy ending"" CD."
3,Someone Said......,"......that Roland Orzabal was TFF. That is not true at all. Ever since Curt left, it just hasn't been quite the same. It is no longer TFF. Roland just used the name for lack of a better one. Granted, Roland has put out some amazing sounds since the split. I love him, but as Roland only. Tears for Fears, was Roland, Curt, Ian and Manny......bottom line."
2,"Flat, contrived and un-inspiring.","You can't blame Roland Orzabal for attempting to strike oil for a second time...unfortunately, ""Tomcats Screaming Outside"" is a contrived and emotionless techno/electro waste of time. This is boring and half-hearted at best.The amount of memorable and enjoyable moments on this album could be compacted into about 3 or 4 minutes of music...about the length of one song. And that one song would only be comparable to the least interesting of the greatness that was Tears for Fears."
5,An amazing album,"I'm not going to pretend to be a reviewer, but this is an amazing disc. I've been listening to it since it came out, and it still blows me away. This SHOULD have been the follow-up to ""Raoul and the Kings of Spain"". Very experimental, especially for hard-core TFF fans.As much as I love ""Everybody Loves a Happy Ending"", I kind of wish he stayed solo and kept making this kind of music."
5,He never fails!,"Being a huge Tears For Fears fan, I just had to run out and buy this import. Roland Orzabal has been making amazing music for so long that I really started to wonder if he could continue to keep up the momentum. Well, he certainly did and then some! I really fell in love with the album ""Raoul & The Kings Of Spain"", but I must say that this is probably Roland's best work to date. That is saying a lot since I really felt ""Raoul"" would be the height of Roland's talent. I can not believe he has outdone himself once again! Such a shame that he is continuously overlooked to the point that most people don't even realize that there really was life after Curt Smith left Tears For Fears. If you like this cd, be sure to check out the Emiliana Torrini album that he recently produced called, ""Love In The Time Of Science"". Once again his brillance eminates!"
5,Desert Island Choice,"This is an album I can't play enough! Roland is very gifted in that he can move in a new direction, and pull it off perfectly. (track 3 is a little weird,though) Do not be put off by the price, it is well worth it. I have played this for many TFF fans who can't believe this isn't played in the states. Quality music is becoming harder to find. Support a MUSICIAN, buy this album."
4,"A Tears For Fears ""techno-pop"" album?","I've been a fan of Tears for Fears since their first album ""The Hurting"" (1983). I can understand why, for this album, Roland chose to release it in his name and not ""Tears For Fears"".The album seems to consist of a collection of synch/computer programmed music tracks with Roland singing. The first time I listened to this album I was very dissapointed. Tears For Fears always had this balance between synchs and ""real"" musical instruments like accoustic guitar or grand piano which is missing on this album. It gives an overall impression of a cheap ""demo"" recording, knocked together in someone's makeshift recording studio in his bedroom.However, after a few plays the album does grow on you. Don't get me wrong, the songs are great. Its just that it does not have the atmosphere of a Tears For Fears album."
3,Tomcats Screaming Outside,"The disk was received in a fairly good condition and it plays well. However, the plastic casing was received damaged. The hinges from the plastic door were broken, so the latter does not hold in place. Disapointing. I don't know if the damage occured in the transit or it was already damaged at the shipping point. The product was put in a padded envelope which is the standard for shipping that kind of product."
4,It Removes!,"This stuff really works. Sometimes it can be very difficult to remove medical adhesive, but this stuff does work. I like it."
5,The Most Comprehensive Guide To American Games,"A super 352 page softbound volume with more than 400 large, full color, sharp photos and over 500 black and white pix. The comprehensive work lists and values 9,000 + games. The back of the book has over 100 pages of color shots of the games. Dates range from 1744 to the present! Major topics range from Games Thru The Ages, to Golden Age, Silver Age, Modern Age, Simulation Games, Role Playing Games, Card Collecting Games and much more. There is a most comprehensive listing of games by category, making it easy to locate items. Prices are year 2000. An outstanding work. Add it to your collectibles library. Toy and game, or Americana enthusiasts will refer to it often."
5,Comfy sandals in the right size,I got these just in time to wear on my cruise. They are well made and comfortable. The price was also reasonable.
1,Doesn't do anything!,"Doesn't smell nice (or bad), doesn't make my scalp feel refreshed or better or anything. It takes a lot to make a lather. For me, it is not at all worth the expense."
5,Great CD,"If you're a Pat Green, or Texas Country fan then this is a must have CD. A live CD, yet very refined, and high quality recordings. The crowd is mixed in well, you can hear the crowd when you're suppose to."
4,Texas music the right way,"It's funny - we Texans are hardest on our own and while I loved the recent Wave on Wave album, this one is still better. Worth the space in the truck on a roadtrip!"
5,Kirk's Best,"A couple of days ago I went to one of Kirk Talley's concerts,and bought this CD.I even got it autographed!I play it all the time!I reccomend all of Kirk's CDs!"
2,Dissapointed,"I was expecting some of Art Linkletter's humor, but found it to be more a textbook on aging."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS ONE. MY COPY WILL BE GOING INTO THE TRASH AS I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE IT AWAY.THEY WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT IT IS PRACTICAL TO DO WITHOUT MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY.[...]GET REAL!
1,cheap trick,I don't rate products that I have not used.I think Stanley makes a quality product and am sure that it will work fine when I get the opportunity to use it. I haven't been able to do so because my search to locate any store that sells the special size P3 staple has been futile - the cheapest online is $3.90 plus $5.00 in postage - almost 50% of the cost of the stapler. If I had known this I would have went with Arrow
1,Lipstick on a pig!,"You can put lipstick on a pig but ...Maybe Shaun has discovered time warp - Baaaa!Are my brain cells really disappearing that quickly, but haven't I seen a few of these stories on previous DVDs?Or, am I really confusing my dream state with reality? Which am I in? Help!"
2,Buyer Beware! Two of these episodes are duplicates!,"As usual Shaun and the gang keep us amused and entertained, but we were a bit disappointed that two of these episodes (""Party Animals"" and ""Draw the Line"") appeared on previous DVDs, leaving only a scant five previously unreleased episodes (Provided you didn't purchase the Season Two boxed set--then there's nothing new!) Hope this doesn't mean that the folks at HiT entertainment have resorted to ""padding"" DVDs with previously released materials to milk more money out of its customers."
1,"New = GREAT, Old = Ripoff","Don't get me wrong, the new episodes on this DVD are as good as any - but they put on a few from previous DVD's . . . but charge the same price? A+ for the new material. F for making the customer pay for things they already own."
4,great help in understanding the BofM,I needed help in not overlooking the small things. There is a lot of thoughts and understandings back when the prophets were writing the BofM that I had overlooked in previous readings. Ludlow assisted me in seeing these small things.
3,My Thoughts,"This book has a wealth of information, but it seems that all the jewels of this book have been implemented into the church's institute or home study manuals. It is good if you want to find out more of the commentary taht Mr. Ludlow has on the Book of Mormon."
1,too old and to old fashioned,"This book is outdated, feels like ti is written by a little old lady and not e and sellable.the book it is touted to be. I found it not good agt all, unless you need someon to tell you tath little lace curtains make your RV more livable."
5,RV Living in the 21st Century,"I enjoyed reading this RV book. I found it to be easy reading and presented in an easy to digest format. The security tips for your house while you are away and health & safety tips are just a couple of subjects out of many, that are invaluable and give you peace of mind! I have been RVing for years and even learned things I hadn't come across before. I am really impressed that another woman RVer knows so much about the systems of an RV and among other things knows how to actually dump the holding tanks. After reading this book you will also know how! One of the most important and overlooked subjects about your RV are the weight issues involved. Peggi gives information about where and how to weigh your RV and terminology involved this includes motorized and towables. For new RVers especially, reading this book will put you light years ahead of the game! Good job Peggi Mcdonald!"
3,So-so,"The author sounds like a nice enough person, but I did not buy the book to learn about her personal life. I was looking for something of a more technical nature to help me decide on what sort of RV I wanted. This book was not it. This is more of a Travels With Charlie type of book. The author is Canadian and a lot of the information has to do with Canadian laws. The photos are amateur photography in black and white and they are fuzzy and indistinct. At times I could not make out what the photos were attempting to show me. She'd be writing about how cute they had fixed up the interior of the RV and there would be this picture of fuzzy something-or-other."
3,fast reading,"My husband and I have never had an RV before and recently ordered a travel trailer. We were interested in educating ourselves about the systems, such as the water and septic, etc... This book was easy and fast to read and did touch on some good ideas but didn't go into the detail we were looking for."
2,Failed expectations,"I bought this book specifically because it was authored by Wally Jay an instructor whom I have the up most respect for. As I was familiar with his students success in competition and the quality of his Club success's over the years, I expected great pictures and techniques. I was hoping to gain insight and further understanding of the arts the book would demonstrate that I knew from my study and experience with the Kodenkan JuJitsu system. What I learned was not worth the price of the book. Just label me as disappointed."
5,"A ""must have"" book","Carla's book was just what I needed when I was diagnosed last fall. Her story was my story.It laid out all that was ahead of me, gave me strength to face it and helped me torecognize the divine interventions that were happening all around me. Although I'm done my treatments, I still go back and reread pages that continue to inspire me.I would recommend it to everyone."
4,Perfect book to learn about CG missions in Vietnam,"I read this book to educate myself about the CG missions in Vietnam and prepare for a ceremony and function in Nov 2012 at Coast Guard Island Alameda, CA to honor our CG Vietnam Veterans. As a CG Civilian and Army veteran, I hold the USCG in very high esteem."
3,Good headphones... but there are better ones for this price range.,"The HD201 is the entry level headphones from Sennheiser. Considering the price you pay, it is value for money. However, if you are able to pay more, get a higher end Sennheiser headphones. I have a HD205 and it goes without saying that the HD205 is better than the HD201.What I do like about the HD201 is that it is lightweight and it is comfortable and fits round the ears very well. The closed ear headphones also reduces some ambient noise. However, it is not a very ""loud"" headphone and when I turned to maximum volume on my player, I could hear a slight distortion.Below are the technical specifications:Acounstic principle: Dynamic, closedEar coupling: CircumauralFrequency response: 21-18,000 HzMax SPL at 1kHz, 1 Vrms: 108 dBTHD at 1kHz, 100 dB SPL: < 0.7%Impedance: 24 OhmsWeight (without cable): 165 gSignal cable: 3 m copper cable (OFC)Connector/adapter: 3.5 mm stereo jack with 6.3 mm adapter"
3,"Good sound, but bad fit.","I admit, I purchased these headphones without doing my homework. I know Sennheiser makes quality headphones I've enjoyed in the past, however this pair is missing a few key details. Although the price and sound quality were good, I've returned them to look for a pair of ""circum-aural"" headphones that fit all the way around my ears, and don't sit on top of my ears like these did. I'll also be looking for a cord that curls like a phone cord. This is a great space saving feature I've enjoyed on previous headphones, that this product lacked. Happy shopping!"
3,Help,"I just bought this item at a Goodwill store and we are stumped as to how to open the compartment to change the battery!!Can anyone help us , please...must be some kind of demented person at Step 2 that devises ways to hide battery compartments . We had the same problem with a vanity...Luckily someone had listed the item here and gave instructions on how to access the compartment . Maybe someone can help?ThanksTata and Nana of 9"
2,"Good for a little while, but not for long","This toy barely made it 4 months. Granted, I knew they were going to grow out of it, but my twin nephews ran this thing into the ground. As boys will do, they were climbing all over this thing, and before too long the wheels were becoming bent, the decals were coming off, and the top was starting to dig into the two bars that hold it up.It was a lot of fun while it lasted, and long enough that they were bored of it before it really broke down, but in all I wish I had gone with something else that may have lasted longer."
2,price check,"couldn't find your "" let us know icon"" Your price for this toy on line is 59.99 at walmart.com it is 49.94 and at target.com it is 49.99. Since I have always had great success with amazon/toysrus I would rather purchase this item through you, but this is a huge price difference. Especially when you have to add shipping costs. Thank you Erica Strahl."
3,Not a good toy,"We received this toy as a Christmas gift and it looked very cute but my 2 year old got very frustrated because the front wheels do not work correctly. We tried it on both Carpet and hardwood and it still did not work correctly. My 5 year old nephew also had problems and asked if i could push him because it was too hard to do it with his legs. Very dissapointing for a great concept. We have returned it! Dont waste you money and if you still want to try it, Giant had them on sale for $..yesterday."
3,Not what I expected,I read all the reviews and thought that this was going to be a really cute toy for my kids. It's ok and not great. I don't like the fact that there is no seatbelt or other form of child restraint for the seat in the back of the toy. It seems almost dangerous. The front wheel sometimes gets stuck sometimes needs a little coaxing to get going again. All in all I don't recommend this toy. Too expensive and too plain.
5,MY SON LOVES THIS TOY,MY SON RECIEVED THIS TOY FOR HIS 2ND BIRTHDAY & HE CAN'T STOP PLAYING WITH IT. HE LOVES THE HORN & SIREN W/ LIGHTS! GREAT TOY. I PURCHASED IT ELSEWHERE MUCH CHEAPER! THE PRICE TO PURCHASE IT ONLINE WITH SHIPPING WAS TO EXPENSIVE. LOOK AROUND YOUR AREA FIRST BEFORE YOU PURCHASE IT ONLINE!
2,Daycare mom,I have had three of this item in the past 3 months and am not happy with any of them .I am returning the third one soon. Steering and wheels are not working correctly. Two children can tip it over also. I bought it for my grandchildren and the kids in my daycare center.A BIG disappointment for me and a BIG hassle to keep returning it to the factory.I have the Police car and the kids LOVE it and play with it every day.I have lots of climbers made by this same company and they have held up for years. 30 years experience in buying childrens toys.
5,Perfect for Toddlers!!,"I have toddler twin boys, and this was a Great Gift! No one feels left out with this toy! They are learning to take turns driving and riding! My big 7 year old daughter often sits on the back and pushes with her feet to move the car, while one of my sons enjoy the front view! This is a VERY durable toy...We have had it indoors and outdoors for over a year now, and it is in like new condition! A Must Buy for parents with more than one little one at home!"
1,to difficult to use,"We purchased this for our daughter who saw one in a store that we could not get her out of it. Of course then when we bought it and got it home, the wheels do not turn easily! Even with us having to push her around constantly in it, we have to keep bending over to straighten the wheels.A real waste of money. And very frustrating for her and us!"
2,Wheels need tread,"I loved the concept of the Fire Engine for Two until I received it. I bought it for my 2 sons for their carpeted playroom in the basement. One of their friends had an older model car for two and I loved it. The difference between the two models makes a huge difference if using it indoors. The older model had tread on the wheels which makes it easy to ride around in -- inside or outside. The newer version just has plastic wheels without tread so if you use it on carpet or grass, the wheels just slide sideways instead of roll. I called Step 2 to see if I could get the wheels replaced but they said there was nothing they could do. My son and his friends love getting into it but find that they can't really get any where and get frustrated."
1,Fire Engine for 2,I really think the construction of this is very poor and when you go to install the roof supports the fasteners that they give you are the kind that once you install them they will never come out. I think the company should have dome some more thought into it. There are diifernt kinds of fasteners that are safe for the kids that can be removed like a nylon screw with a nut. Also the roof support does not sit flush in the hole so when you go and tap the bolt in the hole the pole will shift upwards and you can miss the hole. I even tried to contact the company through their e-mail and also tried to call and no one has called me back. This was a birthday gift that I now have to try to get the roof support secured so it is safe. I will never again buy a step 2 product based on this experience. Also the front wheels they are very hard to turn. I tried to move it with nobody in it and the wheels went where ever they wanted to go except the direction that I was heading.
3,Disappointed Birthday Boy,"This toy is adorable and sturdy, however, my son was very frustrated with it when the front wheels did not rotate properly. My husband tried several things to correct the problem and nothing worked. The kids end up pushing the toy with one or both of the front wheels pointing to the sides instead of forward regardless of the floor surface. Needless to say, Mommy and Daddy's gift ended up being a dud."
2,An inconsistent mystery with little suspense.,"Michael Spraggue, vineyard owner, rich, actor, and a use to be private eye is out to solve the mystery of a dead body found in the trunk of his ex-girlfriend 's car, and current co-owner of his vineyard. The story, at times, held my attention, and at other times, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Ms. Barnes wasn't consistent with the plot or suspense of the ""who-dun-it"" scenario. She's written better."
4,Best adaptation of Lovecraft on video.,"A logical extension of Lovecraft's ""Cthulhu"" stories - this is ""The Music of Erich Zann"" with novels instead of music. Sam Neill is an insurance investigator sent to find author Sutter Cane. Only to find he cannot leave a town which doesn't exist outside of Prochnow's stories - battling ""The Old Ones"". The ending is a little hokier than Lovecraft would write, but a good attempt after all. ""Do you read Sutter Cane?"" PS-Great tribute to Lovecraft in the person of Sutter Cane. I think he would be pleased."
5,swlabr,"This is too weird!!I came home drunk, passed out and had my copy of the movie stolen also!!!!The strange thing is they left a movie in its placeThe title of the movie says,""THE RING"" but when I watched it, it was just 2 people abusing my toothbrush!This is followed by Edward Norton killing a priest, Betty Davis's will,and a mud wresting match between a yetti and the Blair Witch!Oh well ,time to get jiggy with my snub nose.""LOng live the new flesh."""
2,God's not supposed to be a hack horror writer,"When I watched this movie, I got the overwhelming impression of a ""made-for-TV"" movie. Something about the way it was set and how it was filmed placed it's production quality far below what I was expecting. Someone else wrote in their review that John Carpenter just can't ""get it done"" when he has studio funding for a film - and I agree. Halloween and some of Carpenter's other low-budget classics are the movies I would like to remember him by, not this movie.The storyline is mediocre and not much is done to impress in the way of special effects. I simply wasn't impressed with this movie. I thought it would be substantially more unsettling, based on what I'd heard.Bought it. Watched it once. Sold it..."
2,Good for one viewing,"I always have high expectation on horror movies as I expect to be able to view it multiple times. 'In the mouth of madness' works fine for first viewing, but there's no point on keeping the movie for multiple viewing. Rent it before you buy it."
3,"Creepy, But Gets Boring After A While!","This movie freaked me out a few times. Mostly the parts with the kid on the bicycle, and the police officer outside of the building, were the scariest parts added. Like the little surprise John Trent gets when he wakes up in a dream, within a dream.I think the only way I can enjoy this film, is not to watch it for about five more years. Because I get bored of it every time I watch it. That would be the message I am sending to the people who like this movie, too much.If you haven't seen it, then rent it. It is really creepy. Just don't watch it too often. Oh yeah! another good source for this movie, is the main song. That song is very heavy."
3,"A CREEPY, DISTURBING MOVIE","AN INVESTIGATOR, SAM NEILL,FINDS HIMSELF GOING TO THE VILLAGE OF EVIL. ONCE THERE HE GETS CAUGHT UP IN THE END OF THE WORLD. CREEPY, DISTURBING, YET ENJOYABLE."
4,Carpenter Delivers....,"If you are in the mood for chills and thrills, John Carpenter really delivers with In the Mouth of Madness.The film moves quickly and serves up real spine chills along with nice doses of Carpenter's deadpan humor. There is a nice look to the film and the DVD has extensive dialogue between Carpenter and his DP Kibbe if you're interested in that stuff.Whether or not you find the ""explanation"" and/or ending for all this nightmare satisfying or not will probably be beside the point....the trip to it has plenty of interest.A good scare-ride worth taking."
1,Laughable,"Feh, this did nothing for me. It couldn't decide if it wanted to be comedy (Lovecraft???) or horror. Sam Neill at his worst. If you want a real cinematic sense of Lovecraft, go to cthulhulives.org and order ""The Call of Cthulhu""."
2,GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE,"John Carpenter has given us some really good movies: HALLOWEEN, THE FOG, THE THING and even VAMPIRES. However, IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is one of those what's real/what's not real movies that leaves the audience wondering just what the heck is going on. That's not always bad, but there's so much about this movie we never can really figure it out. Sam Neill's performance is on target, but Julie Carmen, Jurgen Prochnow and even Charlton Heston are wasted.Rent, don't buy."
5,"Dumber than dumb, plus super-boring","""Mouth"" has it all-dumb story (really no story at all), terrible acting, cheesy special effects and the drivel goes on and on.Who are they among the 162 who wrote positive reviews? Well, like the movie says-""next we should all flush our brains down the toilet"".Words to the wise.?"
1,"More like ""I wish I hadn't watched it"" Madness","This movie must have been made too late in the digestion process, because by the time you are done watching, you are convinced that it was ""In the Excrement of Madness"".For being made in 1995, the special effects were a joke. I've seen better masks at the drugstore during halloween.The female lead in this movie really ""killed"" my interest, but to the title's credit, her acting did make me MAD.This had so much potential, but I wish Sutter Cane had written in better actors, special effects and directing."
1,Just Awful,"I thought at first was that this feels like a ""Movie of the Week."" As I continued to watch I soon realized that this would never be good enough for that, maybe more of a SciFi Channel movie than a real horror film. Is the acting really this bad or is it just a bad script? This has none of the suspense or eery feel that some other Carpenter films have, in fact at times I laughed out loud at this movie. Save your money."
1,not for carpenter's fans,"I give it one star for a simple reason: the film lacks all the things that make a Carpenter film distinctive; the atmospheric music, the menacing atmosphere, the way he turns a western into sci-fi. In the Mouth of Madness is basically a Lovecraftian story in the big screen, and although Lovecraft's tales work on the printed page (and in the imagination) they don't work when you show it on screen. Carpenter adapted Lovecraft's ideas brilliantly in The Fog, but in that movie, we never see the face of the monsters. Here he shows too much and it doesn't work.I don't blame Carpenter for trying something different, but even Ghosts of Mars or Vampires are better than this.The worst Carpenter movie of all.0 of 9 people found the following review helpful. Obviously these are people who think this ""John Carpenter"" is, in fact, a carpenter, and builds tables. lol"
2,Not good.,"Ignore the good reviews for this film. It sucks. One star is probably closer to the truth but I'm feeling generous. With a bad script, bad effects, and plenty of overacting, this mess has not one scare in its entire running time. Avoid."
4,Good,"Well alot of reviews said this movie was a underrated classic, I was a bit skeptical. Some movies reviewers love, I thought werent so great. Everyone has there opinon and some people fail to realize that. This movie did lead up to the hype. The movie slowly builds into a head trip, and the ending was weird but perfect. I liked the concept of the movie, I liked the town it has in, and was one of Carpentars best films. I highly recommend this movie."
2,Could have been better,"Had all the promise of a better movie but was pooly executed. The end helps a little in theory but makes it worse as well.To summize - the next day I thought if I were to think about the film again I would find the good part and finally see what I missed. Since I have had no realization it just must be a bad film, or maybe it hasn't hit me yet? If it hasn't hit me by now I guess I don't weant to know."
1,I threw up in my Mouth . . . of Madness,"I original bought this DVD a while ago because I thought it had something to do with H.P. Lovecraft. It really is a terrible film. The script is amateurish and the direction of Sam Niel is disappointing and the story is really boring. I really liked The Thing and Escape from New York, but this film is tedious at best, not frightening, and such a derivative mash up of a bunch of horror stories that it has no thematic center. Frankly, it just sucks."
4,Can you help me get to Hobb's End?,"For some reason I find this film unsettling. The scenes set in the darkness in and around the car -- they're stark. The weird kids/old man on the bicycle when he gets hit by the car. And the painful contortion scene. All set in the stygian blackness between our world and Hobb's End. And of course, what could be worse than being stuck in the stygian gulf between here and there?Reaching Hobb's End.I highly recommend this movie. It's off beat, somewhat campy... but underneath a damn good story. Not to mention, an interesting theme."
2,Leaves something to be desired,"If I was an avid fan of John Carpenter, perhaps I would have found the movie more appealing. After viewing it two times, I still find it lacking. First, Julie Carmen STINKS! She lends no support to Sam Neill... (can someone please tell me what he's doing in this movie?! He's so much better than this!) She's stiff and I found this distracting. The plot, although potentially good, failed to deliver. I saw the movie twice just to find any redeeming qualities. While there are some good parts to it, my overall review is that there are better movies to spend your time watching."
4,Almost as good as I remember it...,"This was one of my fave movies growing up. Hardly anyone I know has seen this, and I wonder why it wasn't more popular. Ahead of its time, perhaps? The thing that creeps me out the most is the blue eyes and the painting in the inn."
3,Great Concept Mixed With Some Cheesy Acting,"Before the review begins, it needs to be said that John Carpenter is my favorite director. With that out of the way, In the Mouth of Madness is a good movie that was unfortunately marred by some bad acting and a poor script. Sam Neil did a superb job, but everyone else was somewhat of a let down from my point of view, especially Jurgen Prochnow's role as Sutter Cane. Nevertheless, In the Mouth of Madness is probably Carpenter's last worthwhile directorial effort before slipping into obscurity."
3,Author is regressing,"I have been a fan of the Wingman Series from the beginning and have always been impressed with Ms. Mann's story lines and character development. However Private Maneuvers and The Cinderella Deal seem to be almost written by someone else! Both stories lacked plot development and in the interest of writing a full book, the author seems to be going around in circles with internal dialogue between the main two characters. In Private Maneuvers, the female protagonist does the chasing, and personally comes across as needy and desperate, and very little is written to indicate why she continues to chase the male lead. Several times the story line seem to be coming together, but then I would turn the page and find the author has jumped ahead a few days. Very amateurish and lazy, I expected better from this author. I have given her two chances to redeem herself. I will not be following her work in the future."
1,very disappointing,"The toy arrived with scratch marks all over....The box did not look like an original Sevi, Knock off? I guess you get what you paid for.....very disappointing :("
2,E-Book NOT !,"This book was disappointing. Although billed an an ""e-book"" the CD-ROM included is nothing more than spiral bound printed book. Granted the pictures are in color on the CD, and only B&W in the spiral-book ... but no big deal with the ""e-book"" feature. The book includes some basic photography information interspersed with features of the 995, but the 995 info can all be found in the owners manual, and there are a lot better photography technique books available. The concept of the e-book appealed to me, but I'm disappointed, BIG TIME !"
4,Great fan but can be difficult to install,"I agree with most of the reviews. A very high quality fan: quiet and moves a lot of air. I installed it from the unfinished attic above so I was able to cut the opening from above and did not have to patch drywall. The difficulty comes in having to customize the 2x4 framing around the fan. The bottom line is that, depending on joist spacing and possible interference from electrical or plumbing lines, you need AT LEAST moderate skills to install it."
2,"Quiet yes, a pain to install","The fan is indeed quiet. However whoever designed it clearly never tried to install it. You have to build a box frame for it, no support arms included. You can get it at most wholesale electrical suppliers for what Amazon is selling it for."
4,Chris Ward: As good as usual,"This book, like all Mr.Ward's books, is filled with generous texts and explanations joined to only the best players games.He admits giving more space to the variations with an early e2-e4 because he thinks it is the only real way to test Black's choice of opening. In this sens, probably the more positional players could be more attracted by other books on this system.I have seen on Amazon.com at least one book that puts more emphasis on the early Nf3 variations.A book that fits the needs of those who wish to understand the basic and more on the Queen's Gambit Accepted."
5,"Lots of good, fun, facts.",This is one of the top three books on this subject. The other two are: (1)The Soul Of Tone: Celebrating 60 Years Of Fender Amps (2)Fender: The Sound Heard 'Round The World. All three get five stars.
3,Good Book In It's Day.....,"This book, while in it's a day I'm sure was great, has now been supplemented by Fender's The Soul of Tone which is really the book one would want if he or she is a Fender Junkie like myself. I dream of owning some of the amps (the tweeds in particular), but I can only dream. Fender Amps are the Rolls Royce of Guitar and Bass Amplifiers! While the paperback book was good in it's day, I'd recommend you go for The Soul of Tone.... You won't be disappointed and it's worth every cent!"
1,Worst concert ever!!!,"Slade Craven was definitely not on his game for his farewell concert. One of his strong points has always been his ""stick-to-itivism"" and single-minded, determined work ethics.Imagine my chagrin as he walked off after a half hearted attempt at one song (albeit a great, great ?^in' tune!).All that aside, Slade's gumption really ended up coming through in saving many lives by safely landing a very complex aircraft and averted an evil metaphysical event in Kansas.Slade dropped off the radar(no pun intended) after this heroic feat, and I have heard rumors from fellow Slade fans that he has changed his appearance so that he looks more like his high school yearbook photo, and is now persuing the ""sensitive singer/songwriter"" school of music.Any leads, anyone?"
3,Pretty Good,"Why do they keep producing films that sucked the first time they released it. The first Turbulence did not do good at all at the theatres(if it was even released theatrically)so why would a company keep churning out sequels to an orginal film that did AWFUL!! Anyway, this movie was better than I thought it would be but it's definitly not oscar material! And I really reccomend that you rent first before you pay to own it!"
2,A real disaster...,"Joe Mantegna, Gabrielle Anwar and Craig Sheffer are wasted in this really trashy installment of the ""Turbulence"" series.The plot is dumb... a M. Manson lookalike who's giving a live concert on a 747 rescues the plane from a Satanic cult, the acting is awful . . . and the cheap ""heavy metal"" music tops it all!Keep away from this."
3,Not as bad as you might expect,"First of all, how did they manage to get Joe Mantegna, Gabrielle Anwar and Craig Sheffer in this? Poor Joe must have his career on life support if he has to do this stuff.But seriously, I actually stumbled across this on cable and actually watched it from beginning to end. The idea of having a concert on an airplane is certainly unique, albeit ridiculous one (somehow they managed to find a large stage area, with a light show and extensive props. Where??).Anyway, the film holds your interest and there's a sense of fun about it. It doesn't take itself seriously and you find yourself actually getting caught up in it. As far as a B-MOVIE, it's not half bad.But I'm STILL wondering how the heck they managed to stage a concert inside a 747."
1,What were they thinking of??,"I don't know if I have seen the same movie as the other reviewers, but I can safely say that it is one of the worst I have seen.A heavy metal concert abroad a plane..a Marilyn Manson lookalike..a rock star that is taught how to land a plane. Please! spare me.The action sequences and dialogue are closer to comedy, not intended I tell you.I am baffled as to what on earth Rutger Hauer, Gabrielle Anwar and Joe Mantegna are doing there???Maybe with other less known and talented actors, the film would have been more bearable.The only saving grace in all this mess, is watching Anwar and Monika Schnarre, two very beautiful women, but sadly the script and direction are a waste.Save your $$s for a proper action film, and give this one a miss."
5,okay yeah sure,"okay i can understand that people could hate this movie. it's the kinda movie that people love to hate. i loved it anyway. slade craven is a major babe, the clothing in the movie is a-ma-zing and the characters are lovable. these qualities are enough to cover up the lack of story and bad acting. it's a movie you watch to get away from reality (dude, what's with the metal detector woman, wish airport personnel treated me like that).loved it."
4,johto photo finish,"vol 5 is probably the best of johto league episodes. It's got better storylines and more crunch in the battles. The reunion of friends gives vol 5 a more exciting punch to watch. The good thing is that it shows how hard a pokemon trainer has to work, especially for the gym badges."
4,not joking about the smell,"The mat is lovely- as another reviewer said, the colors are better in person. And the thickness and stickiness feel good to me.Some reviewers said they didn't notice much of a smell; maybe it's the luck of the draw, but mine smells really offensive. I've got it hanging over the shower rod to let it air out, and the bathroom smells like something toxic and chemical. Hopefully it will dissipate in another day or so..."
3,Stinky!,"Smells very strongly of chemicals or something! Not very soothing for someone who wants to do yoga. Also, it slipped around on my carpet a lot, making it hard to do my positions. Didn't love this, but I love the colors and patterns."
5,A nice surprise after reading other reviews,"I have no other data point for comparison, this being my first mat; but I'm satisfied within all reasons. I definitely thought more than twice before buying, for fear of it turning out to be a smelly, slippery, too-thin, good-looking good-for-nothing-else. I was eventually still overcome by its charming looks, and so far I love it! The thickness turns out to be pretty acceptable (I'm doing it on carpet though); it's still smelling strongly (after 3-4 days) when I put my face next to it, but oh well, it's better than the air of Shanghai (where I'm from)."
4,Great rocky christian music to get u goin,"Broomtree's albumn transparent is really great because they find the balence between screaming rock and hymns. i especially like the beginning of the cd... how it doesn't start with say a crescendo, but starts pumpin out the audio as soon as u hit play. i really recommend this cd -funkyworklehead"
2,disappointing,"The photo for this product shows a lever closure - but that is not what I got. I got a ring and post closure that, well - DOESN'T CLOSE!! What use is a tea ball that doesn't keep the tea leaves inside the mesh? Wasn't worth the $ to return it, but it can't be used either.I've used the kind that is shown in the photograph. And they work very well. I am using one like it now - I just wanted a spare."
2,Poor Condition,"One of the bowls came broken, then as I took one of them out of the packaging it broke in my hand, all I had was the handle in my hand. So, my 12 piece is now a 10 piece sitting on my shelf because I am afraid to use it for guest. I do not want it to break while serving and have one of my guest hurt. I wouldn't buy this Optic Punch Set. It is poorly made(quality), and be careful when handling it. It will break almost by just touching it."
4,Optic punch set,It was very nice for the price. I especially liked the size of the punch cups. They will provide several other uses.
1,Poor quality,Quality of product was very poor. Curtains ripped while I was hanging them. I purchased a similar product from Macy's and the quality was excellent.
2,not what it seems,"the comforter is large, I bought QUEEN size for my queen size bed, but it hangs nearly to the floor! The curtains are real thin too.But the sheet set is wonderful!It is NOT nearly as lovely as the other set I purchased in jacquard, no where close."
2,too bright,"This product works fine, the radio is clear and it is easy to adjust. However, as with all the clock radios I returned, the light is way too bright. If I turn towards the clock at night it wakes me up."
3,Building a playset,"I have not found this book to be very helpful. I wanted a book that would walk me through the steps of building a play set. Because I am a novice at building, I probably need more of a ""Playsets for Dummies"" type book."
4,Reworking the Familiar,"A curiously compelling little movie, Crashout is a throwback to the tough prison-escape movies of the 30's. Fortunately, the producers had the good sense to hire an expert cast of B-movie veterans to enliven an otherwise shopworn plot. Writer-producer Hal Chester and director-writer Lewis Foster provide each convict with a distinct personality that holds viewer interest as tensions mount, while the audience anticipates how each character will be brought to justice. Standouts in the cast are the always subtle Arthur Kennedy, an engagingly ambivalent Marshall Thompson, and William Tallman doing his scary psycho bit, this time as a knife-throwing religious fanatic. And in a poignant bit part, cult favorite Gloria Talbott as the prospect of a normal life for the ill-fated Thompson. Though you've seen it all before, there are many nice touches that lift this otherwise generous slice of thick-ear beyond the merely routine."
3,Should be called Low Carb Vegan,"The cook book is a bit of a disappointment - it's completely vegan which is not what I am. Some recipes I've tried, but was looking forward to some new ideas involving eggs, cheese or even milk."
2,Low-Carb Vegetarian by Margo DeMello,"Have been pescovegetarian for many years. This book is disappointing; the recipes are simplistic. The associated nutrition is limited, in eliminating some foods that should be included in healthful food intake. Leans towards more of a ""fad"" diet.Would not buy it again, and will probably donate it to my local humane society thrift store. Hopefully, it will find a useful home with somebody else !!"
3,Some interesting recipes but not for the soy allergic,"I loved the concept behind this book. I've tried to live a low-carb life for several years and have recently made the decision to go meatless so I hoped this would provide inspiration. Unfortunately virtually every recipe involves soy products. Since my body does not like soy at all there are very few recipes here that will be useful. There are tempting looking recipes for Pasta Puttanesca (one of my favorites), a Curried Cauliflower Dal Soup that looks good, and a Japanese Salad I want to try but, for the most part, the recipes are loaded with soy -- including meat-substitute soy products."
3,"Shows potential, but it is not a masterpiece...","The writing is in general very smooth and captivating.The subject is interesting but the development of the story is far from earthshaking.The disapperance of the fathers to the moon is indeed very inventive but it sticks out form the rest of the book - perhaps it overpromises to the reader.I do not think I lost by reading it - it has its strong moments but it is not a masterpiece. He is a young writer, I hope he has more to offer in the future. I will not hesitate to pick up his second book when it comes out..."
3,"Just ok, nothing more","Honestly, I am surprised this got published...and I am surprised it was chosen for my wife's book club. It's probably the first book I've read in quite some time where I spend time reflecting after I was done reading it. I gave this 3 stars because I was able to read it in such a short time that I didn't feel terribly cheated by the utter lack of character development."
5,PERFECT,I bought this cd as a camp music minister!! this cd had a great array of songs to choose from and the kids absolutely loved it! Every afternoon they just stood up and gave ther ALL to God!! ive never seen such an awesome thing as when children get together and worship. well worth buying the cd it definitely paid off! and now my neice can listen in the car :)
1,huh?,"i havent even heard this ""import"" album but i think that it sux cause its not from the u.s. her ""non-import"" is good tho"
5,Excellent DVD,"This is the best Tokyopop FMW DVD release yet. The bad jokes and stupid stories that the announcing team told in the previous Tokyopop releases are gone, replaced by straight-forward and informative commentary. I salute Tokyopop for listening to the complaints of the fans in regards to the commentary and correcting this problem.As for the DVD itself- you get 3 great Hayabusa matches, a long video introduction showing highlights of him performing his most popular moves, and interesting stories telling you the background of each match. The matches are in crystal-clear DVD quality, with great stereo sound too. I'd recommend this to any wrestling fan, whether you are a long-time Hayabusa fan or are just curious to see how great a wrestler he is."
2,It has its ups and downs.,"Well, for starters, there are problems with this. The music is crappy and obnoxious, some small parts of matches are clipped out, there are very, very limited ""extra"" features for a DVD, and the biggest one of all, the commentary is godawful. Its terrible, I watched this video over three days because after about 20 minutes I couldn't stand listening to those idiots anymore, ""Straight Up"" John Watambe couldn't stop himself from calling every 4th word out of his mouth ""straight up"". On the plus side, the matches that are on the CD are quite good, but again a downer, paying 22 bucks for a DVD thats essentially nothing more than three wrestling matches isn't a steal by any stretch of the imagination. So, to sum it up, I enjoyed the actual wrestling, but you have to look past some real problems, the main one being ""straight up"" morons for commentators."
4,Interesting Perspective on Giving from The Super Rich,"This book is about 1/4"" thick and is an essay written by Andrew Carnegie in June 1889. It's an interesting perpective on what very wealthy people should do with their money to improve society. He doesn't believe in handing over the cash when you die to your children but rather spending it before you die on free libraries, parks, etc. to improve life for the common man. It was recommended reading from a book on History of Wall Street."
1,Don't Buy,"Just a quick note, the essay is interesting, but it is in the public domain, and a complete text of the essay can be found with a quick google search. Don't waste your money."
1,don't buy - don't buy -,"""the gospel of wealth, by Andrew Carnegie"" - sounds interesting, but it wasn't. This is the text of a magazine article he wrote. The theme is transfering wealth to future generations by inheritance, foundations, or spending it yourself before you die.If you buy this book, you will get a razor thin book that is just a few thousand words."
1,A greedy oppressor of the working man,"Carnegie gained his wealth by ruthlessly crushing the working man--crushing trade unions, cutting wages in the interest of profit. Yes, he built many libraries, etc. but he still died wealthy, with wealth obtained at the cost of the lives and health of tens of thousands of his employees. This is what American capitalism is built on, and we accept it as gospel truth now, without ever taking a real look at this man!"
3,Almost wasteful,"Though this essay has good points, there are also things you must look at; greed. Greed can ultimately leed to things that harm and hurt people.I agree with the fact that richer people help the economy but I also would like to add that they are very influencial... these rich people get outplayed and others follow. It always matter what kind of person.Keeping money within your pocket doesn't help at all... and so does this say that. Circulate through the economy, but also circulate through the poor.--Actually, I havn't read most of it, i'm just blabling on. YEY!"
1,1st Chapter (!) gives incorrect definition - YIKES!,"SIGH. The very first chapter (Essential Vocabulary I) lists the definition of ""ambulatory"" as ""able to work"" - YIKES ! When did the definition change from 'able to WALK' - WALK not ""work."" One has to be leery about the rest of the book. Sigh."
3,The Reader Struggle,"As a progressive/liberal who grew up in the 60's and obtained a graduate degree in community psychology... except for some interesting recent examples this book provides... I have heard it all before. There is little new content in this 134 page book that reads like a group of collected college lectures. Political progressives are likely to feel, at least in part, that Parenti is preaching to the choir. It is good to seek alternative perspectives, to be awake. But now that we have had our consciousness awakened and enlivened... what shall we do?It is regarding the ""What shall we do then, given this is how things are?"" question that inevitably comes up when reading this kind of book that the author is largely silent.Where is the Saul Alinsky for our new century?"
4,Great product!,"I have tried a several different beddings for our two guinea pigs: wood shavings (cheap, but not very absorbent, and seemed to give one of the piggies respiratory problems), Care Fresh (good, nice and soft, but expensive), paper shreds (not very absorbent). Cell-Sorb is really absorbent, keeps odors at bay for quite some time, and doesn't clump, so you can easily scoop it out of the cage when it is cleaning time. The only downside is that it is not very soft. So we now have settled on the following routine: first a layer of Cell-Sorb, then a thin layer of Care Fresh on top. The Cell-Sorb is not too expensive, has the desired good absorbency, while the Care Fresh is soft and keeps the pigs comfortable. Of course two piggies make more messes that one, but now we only have to change the bedding every five to six days or so. I am very happy with the Cell-Sorb, and can higly recommend it!"
1,Stinks,"The product was alright in the beginning but then it started to smell of urine, even after the wet saturated material was removed. I had gotten it because one of my cats has urinary problems. I'm not sure if this product caused him to get ill, but he has passed away now. I have switched back to my old litter and will never buy this product again."
1,The clasps don't hold well,"I think I have owned these earrings for 4 weeks and I just lost one of them yesterday. I do love the oval shape and I received compliments on them. One earring the clasp was super tight and the other popped up and down very easily. I looked at it to see if I could tighten it, but there is no way to do it. If you get two earrings with super tight clasps, then your good to go!"
4,Some Real Intense Analysis,"I'm a Religious Studies student at NYU, and I bought this book to help me research a term paper on the depiction of religious practices in shockumentaries, particularly Mondo Cane. While Goodall's take on the genre's tropes and themes often get bogged down in pedantry, his arguments are deep and intriguing, and it's obvious he took great care when viewing and reading these films. His survey goes far beyond Mondo Cane...pretty much every shockumentary available on US DVD is present here (and then some). It certainly helped me with my paper. Recommended for film and media scholars!"
4,"The First Filmbook about the ""Mondo""-Genre","""Sweet and Savage"" is to my knowledge the first filmbook to the exploitation-genre of the Mondo-Films (Shockumentaries) and the cult around Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi and belongs therefor in any filmbook-collection. Nevertheless improvement is possible (colour pictures, more pictures, better structure, more information) - so let's hope this is not the last work about this underground-filmgenre !"
3,Those crazy canadians. . . .,"The Klutz is a movie about Claude(Claude Michaud) and how he screws up everything he does in his day to day life.This movie is canadian, and all the actors speak french. The dvd offers a dubbed english version though. Michaud, the star of the film, is not even present on the packaging of the dvd. I guess that doesn't bother most people, but it bothered me. The sound is horrendous, as is the picture. It's a pretty funny movie, in the ""This movie [stinks] so badly it's funny"" way. I'm going to give The Klutz a generous three stars and a thumbs in the middle."
2,Almost lousy,"Although a fan of French films and historical realism, I was disappointed with this particular work. The film is not terribly advanced; it's themes are simple and portrayed well, but not excellently. The characters are somewhat realistic, but not developed well, and most are not likeable, even when they should be. Moreover, the film is boring; it takes a lot of time to relate even a little bit of not so interesting information. The ending, meanwhile, is anti-climatic and not totally unexpected. The average viewer will watch with a cold detachment, at best. Overall, not a bad film to watch if you've absolutely nothing better to do, but there are much better French films out there."
4,Pleasingly Surprised,"I was surprised at how well-paced this horror flick was - back to basics, with a group of tourists trapped in an underground labrynth of mines with a vengeful spirit linked to a past of wrong-doings. Standard stalk'n'scare plot well executed, like a low-rent (but exciting) take on Neal Marshall's ""The Descent""."
3,dutch rip-off of american zombie movie for teens formula,"It's less boring and irritating not to have American youth. This Dutch version escaped inclusion of the usual bimbos and the acting was better which it is why it is up to 3 stars not 2.When the action got exciting my view was jerked around as if filmed with a hand-held camera. This fad of "" found amateur footage"" since Blair Witch was duitifully copied by the Dutch as a realism device. YET this film was nota "" found-footage "" type of film......"
4,B52's ON SPEED!,"This is a good party album, it makes you want to get up and shake your [booty]. Most songs are corny but this album isn't trying to be anything but a flashy summer party cd anyways."
2,General Disappointment,"""Move Your Feet"" is such an infectious track, I wouldn't be surprised if most people bought the album because of it. Sounds pretty normal to me. The problem I have with this particular album is that there isn't another song that matches the colorful, catchiness AS ""Move Your Feet.""Its trippy electro-funk beat and fun vocals are a dance floor necessity, but the rest of ""D-D-Don't Stop the Beat"" are relative filler. Campy 60's beach music revisited, ridiculously boring dance-pop and all-around less interesting tracks stand behind ""Move Your Feet's"" irresistible hook and memorable feel.Do not buy this album expecting retreads and/or similar songs to ""Move Your Feet."" It's obvious Junior Senior have been riding the coattails of said hit and is no wonder that they've virtually slipped from popularity since its appeal has died down.What to expect next? Probably another clumsy dance album with one true hit and a bunch...I mean a BUNCH...of filler."
2,Disappointment!,"After hearing ""Move Your Feet"" on the radio, I was psyched for 2 months for the album's US release. What a disappointment, none of the tracks sound like ""Move Your Feet."" After reading several reviews that compared Junior Senior's sound to Chic, perhaps my expectations were too high. Suffice it to say, the songs are sloppy and annoying with that one notable exception, and bear NO resemblance to old school disco."
1,Yuck,"Don't buy it, you'll regret it. I did. The title track is catchy for awhile. It eventually gets old. Besides, how cool can it be if VH1 used it in all their ads?If you are looking for fun, unusual music to bring to a party, just to watch all the rap boys and girls freak out, purchase an album by The Soft Pink Truth. Their latest release ""Do you want New Wave or do you want the Soft Pink Truth puts this watered down drizzle to shame."
4,"hes jr, hes sr","the other day i gave in and picked up a copy of junior senior's d-d-don't stop the beat. while my indie rock cred filled head screamed, ""no!"" the devil on my shoulder (dressed in mc hammer pants and a trucker hat) said ""get it!"" so, as usual, i went with the shoulder boy's opinion and got it.so happy i did.the album not only makes you shake your ass from the dance aspect, but at heart it's a soulful rock album as well. it's garage-y at times and electronic at others, but always maintains its sense of earthiness and analog vibe. ""move your feet,"" undoubtedly the best track and the album's obvious single ( i just picture them walking into the record company and signing right away ) makes you wanna jump out of your room and head to the nearest club.""chicks and d*icks"" is a hilarious countersexual song which showcases the affiliation of the two (junior and senior) and the rest of album is rollicking and fun, too.get the chip off your shoulder and get this cd."
4,"Very, very good!!!!","Happy, ""bounce around the room"" music somewhat reminisent (sic?) of the Ramones. Can't help but move around when listening...."
3,better than you would think,"this is a weird cd b/c it is so hard to categorize. It is danceable, dorky, gay overtoned, cheesy, bubble gummish yet, it actually rocks! There's even cool, fuzzed out guitar all over it.It cannt be for the dance crowd b/c of the cool guitar and references to 70's punk acts.could it appeal to rockers? It is very danceable, makes you want to jump around your car while listening to it.Is it for the gay crowd only? I don't think so b/c there is a call for girls.Is it top 40 trash? No, it is too damn inventive!""Coconuts"" and ""move your feet"" are actually cool rock songs!I think, what the other reviewer said, is true. This is danceable Cramps/Ramones/B-52/60's garage band music.In conclusion, since it is difficult to be categorized, that means they are more original, less derivative and therefore this is a thumbs up cd.It has great cross over appeal since it does rock, groove, twange and is very catchy. This is the ultimate guilty pleasure cd!"
3,squirrels who are drunk...,"i love the video, that's where i first saw junior senior. the video was so cool so i went out (it was payday) and bought the cd and can't stop listening to it. i live in a crappy small town but i can only imagine how much fun it'd be to hear this in a club. the rest of the album is still growing on me, but those are usually the kind that i love the best. it's really rocking."
3,Never knew this band existed until I saw the movie White Chicks.,"There's only three songs on the CD that I like, but I was willing to sacrifice. I have no regrets. Thanks."
2,"Needs more senior, less junior","2 1/2Not worth too much. Granted, I don't go for many inherently club-centric releases, but unusually tempting bait from an initial single of alternadance plus a few other (of course first side-situated) tracks quickly wore thin, exposing a shallow and repetitive excuse of a party."
5,Once more,"I wrote an earlier review extolling the product and the (considering my dealings with others) astounding response for shipping. Excellent product.I got the first for use as a sculptor's stand. Obvious, when you think about a medium sized work. Well, I got the stool and am so pleased I ordered another so I can work on two simultaneously. I *had* a table-top stand, but I'll replace it with this at twice the price because it's far more than twice the quality and convenience of use.Thanks again guys."
5,Afton of Margate Castle,This has been an excellent read by this author. I have received this immediately through the electronic transfer to my Kindle Reader.
3,Alright,I found this book to only alright whilst I say this because the book I believe was very boring in places and very dragged out and uninteresting which is sad because it is a fairly well written story just with some boring bits which makes the book somewhat unreadable in places - I would have to say if you love historic books then this may be for you but if you are not in historic books then it may not be worth you reading it
1,BORING,Get ready to be depressed! I don't pick up a romance novel with the intent to feel sorry for the lead character throughout the ENTIRE book. This book just made me sad. Not even the ending could make up for the awful plot.
5,A must read book,This book hit every element a worthy book needs to be interesting. It's a great book for young readers such as teens.I found it highly enjoyable. God showed each character his/her way. Each character had very separate and contrasting characteristics which caused some pretty interesting conflicts within the storyline. A must read book by my opinion.
2,Too drawn out,"I must admit, though the plot was good, this book was way too drawn out! I think I spent most of the time just skimming through this book, hoping to reach the conclusion soon."
4,Afton of Margate Castle -Cleanly written. Good for Book Clubs,"I love historical stories and romances but I hate to be reminded ofa time when women were valued mostly as a childbearing tool.This novel was very well written and, though full of intense violence,was unfortunately a story of the ups and downs of many people's lives.I hated the reality of results from vain, foolish choices, the wickedness thatare in many upon earth, how evil often prevails, and the injustices thatoften occur.There is romance, action, adventure, loyalty and betrayal all portrayedwithin these pages. This can safely be read by YA and Adults too."
4,"powerful songs, great guitar parts and rock solid drumming","I was in St. Pete Florida this past April, checking out one of my favorite local bands, and was a little surprised at the great support band on the bill - a Christian rock band called ""Jesse's Vineyard."" These guys have the songs, the looks and the talent. I bought their CD ""Unclear Near"" at the show (I think it was the first day of release) and I must say that this is a band that has what it takes to be successful. The CD is strong enough to please both Christian and secular markets. What's more, the band's ministry provides a great message. The CD is filled with powerful songs, great guitar parts and rock solid drumming and I recommend it strongly to ANY modern rock enthusiasts, Christian or secular."
5,"""Our own imaginations and understanding.""","My friend Llynn recommended this book, and so I'll let her words be my recommendation to you:I haven't got a definitive guide to the TdM but... 'Personality, Divination, and the Tarot' by Carl Sargent, was recommended because the author uses the TdM. Why did the author choose the TdM? Because the cards come without a LWB! 'The Marseilles deck...forces us back upon our own imaginations and understanding.'As the title suggests the cards are described using personality theories, but then suggestions are made for reading with the cards. Rather than upright and reversed meanings he gives positive and negative interpretations.If you like a psychological approach to Tarot then this may be a good book to use.:) Thanks, Llynn!"
5,Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President,"Allen Guelzo has written a masterly and long-overdue intellectual biography of a leader whose political, moral and religious thought shaped and guided our nation at the time of its greatest crisis. Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President traces every important thread in the formation of Lincoln's intellectual development, and sets each in the context of historical events and the main currents of American thought. Guelzo's remarkable and important book should be read by all students of American history, period, and by anyone with any pretension to understand the intellectual history of this country."
1,Misrepresented,"Mr. Guelzo gives the impression of being an elite who can't pass up an opportunity to diminish the people's President. I think he misrepresented his book on CSPAN. I prefer more facts and less subjective adjectives and interpretations. I don't even find his interpretations logical. His book did have some interesting information in it, however, I didn't bother to finish reading it."
2,His Contemporaries Didn't Think So Highly,"I continue to be amazed at the continued apotheosizing of Lincoln. This book is just another one of many written in an attempt to pile on just one more spoon of 'whipped cream' on the only ceasar America ever had.Lincoln's contemporaries didn't think that highly of him, so why should we. Lincoln sought power, pure and simple, and he found it be rewarding his enemies and ignoring his friends.So many of you are so easy to brainwash."
4,Love these sandals except . . .,"I love Naot sandals--they are comfortable, wear well and don't look too little-old-ladyish even though they are really supportive. The sandals came quickly, were well packaged and in good condition. The sale was a great price, too. However, this particular pair is tight --I have never had this problem before and may end up taking them somewhere professional to have them stretched out so they will feel more comfortable. I bought a different pair earlier this summer from a different vendor which did not have this problem, so I don't think it's my feet. Anyway, I still think it's a great sandal--would definitely reccommend them to anyone looking for a nicelooking, comfortable yet supportive sandal."
5,A TRUE NAVY NAOT,NAOT HAS SOME STRANGE SHADES FOR NAVY. THIS ONE IS TRUE. VERY COMFORTABLE AS ARE ALL NAOTS. GREAT FOR CURING FOOT PAIN.
3,NAOT SANDALS,I have bought these sandals in a physical store before and they fit better. The ankle strap just didn't have enough velcro on it or it wore off quicker than expected.
3,Not as good as LEGO Creator series,"Diagrams for projects are poor. Some pieces don't fit together properly. Educational in that it teaches kids how to follow a diagram and build in sequential steps, but it's frustrating because the diagrams aren't clear enough. I'm 51, really good at diagrammed instruction, and I found it frustrating. Compared with similar LEGO project, not as good."
2,Not a Lego,The instructions to this plane are definelty not lego instructions. What a difference. My grandson gave up and made up his own design. Would never buy a product by this company again.
3,Not as shown,"Bought this fighter jet for my son who is totally into fighter jets. It is compatible with Legos so I was thinking that all the jet shapes could be used with other sets to create endless jets. The package that showed up was the same model number but did not look ANYTHING like the jet shown on Amazon's site. The box was revamped and had only a few specialized jet parts, but was mostly squared and plain looking, as using regular lego pieces. I was very disappointed but couldn't return it because my son had already been waiting 10 days for the package. Anyway, with that said, the quality of the parts was not too bad. The back tail wings break off constantly but other than that it went together pretty well."
3,Hard to keep assembled,"I usually assemble pieces like this with crazy glue but I ran out while I was in the process of putting it together and I will never do that again. There are a gazillion pieces with this toy and they were difficult to put together. The pieces are constantly falling off. My little boys love the idea of it, but they can't play with it like I was hoping."
1,Don' buy this toy.,"I don't usually write reviews, but this toy was SO bad,that I'd like to save you the trouble and money. As others have noted, the diagrams are terrible & the pieces do not fit well together. What ends up happening is that while your working on the next step, the pieces from previous steps fall off, making it terribly frustrating. The educational value? Patience and perseverance, but as I was building this with my 7yr old son, I also wanted to give up on it. Now its just a matter of principle getting through it. Get Lego brand, we've never ran into these issues with their building sets."
2,Tiny!,"This necklace may be genuine amber, but the chips are very small. The picture shown is larger than the actual necklace."
5,"Great, easy to read resource","I bought the book and found it easy to read and helpful. The section on how to clean up your credit report was particularly useful for me. Cleaning up my report will hopefully allow me to qualify for the home loan I will be applying for soon. I only read the sections that applied to my financial situation, but I will keep the book handy to help with any future credit repair needs. S. Green"
5,Excellent resource for credit improvement.,"This was a wonderful book full of lots of details on how credit works. There are lots of tips on how to improve one's credit and a good discussion of budgeting, identity theft, and dealing with collectors.I'd recommend this to anyone who needs help with their finances."
4,Easy to understand !!,"Who says you have to spend [...] and go to a credit repair service. This book is a GREAT resource for people wanting to have a better understanding of ""how"" the credit system is designed and how you can help yourself if you just apply the time. Another GREAT book about credit repair can be found at www.BestCreditLife.com."
4,Big House USA,"Recently, I toured a prison museum here in Canon City, Colorado. Many of the actors in the film used the maximun security prison as the backdrop for the scenes. Plus the film is based on a historical event. And I am a fan of Brodrick Crawford (Highway Patrol) and others. My only dislike is that it is in B/W."
5,THIS MIRACLE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY,"My 15 year old daughter has literally been knocking on deaths door for 3 years after our move to the Midwest. She was suffering from constant walking pneumonia, bronchitis, Flu's, and upper respiratory infections. Finally after many doctors, relentless testing, and several emergency room visits, she was diagnosed with severe environmental allergies even though she did not exhibit any traditional allergy symptoms except an occasional hive. Steroids did not work for her and I refused to keep her on them after 2 weeks. Solaray Quercetin QBC Plex is a miracle. I combined this with Immuplex (thanks to my ex father-in-law who is a Naturopath) and I have my child back happy, healthy, and full of energy! She also gave up sugar. To avoid hives we also use Yin Chiao. I hope these products work as well for others."
5,Keeps histamine and hives at bay!,I started taking this product due to multiple allergies and constantly breaking out in hives. It works!!! I take 1 tablet twice a day and problem solved.
1,Anything but Fabolous!,"I personally did not enjoy this album at all. The only great track was ""Can't deny it"", although I liked ""Ride for this"" feat. Ja Rule. So Hollaback to your friends and spread the word that that Ghetto Fabolous just isn't worth it. I would strongly suggest that you don't take the time to listen to this unFabolous album."
1,People are you crazy??!,"How could anybody say this MC is hot??! That's nonsense! First off, this is mainstream gangsta-rap with no clues of creativity. Excuse me, he has one Clue who is a DJ but that's just a f@rt in a windstorm. Mainly, club-oriented sell-out tracks, repetitive themes, unoriginal rhymes, not creative beats. People, please look deeply in yourselves: why is that great hype about this MC??! What about Lone Catalysts, MF Doom, Saukrates, Reks, Non-Phixion?? If you want original rhymes and creative beats without that mediocre thug image then go and dig for Mission Control, Cali Agents, Necro, Lone Catalysts, or the old Keith Murray.Fabolous is just plain mediocre, unoriginal, repetitive, average...For real! Told: 1 stars..."
1,enter the wackness,"Man...this cat is a complete joke. Does he have any skills at all? It's quite unfortunate that people consider this hip-hop, have they never heard of KRS-ONE, TRIBE, DE-LA, WU-TANG, or JERU. It seems that very few labels are putting our real hip-hop these days. Thank god for Def-Jux. Do your homework! Peace,"
1,Fabulously (...),"Fabolous? Where in da hell did he come from? The whole world thinks that he is the next big thing and he is horrible. Hell, atrocious is the correct word to describe him. If U need some evidence, hear ""Holla Back"". Apparently, he forgot that you need lyrical content to shine on your records and his lyrical content doesn't surpass the average 1st grader! ""Cant Deny It"" with Nate Dogg is aiite, but it's the best song on this piece of garbage. My friend gave me this and i wanted to throw this out of the window when I heard it! If U want a real lyricist with some logic and a great flow, get Stillmatic or Reflection Eternal! 1"
1,The only good thing about it is the Fabulous lip on cover,"What can I say about fab? Well he claims he tries to be original with his lyrics and say things in ways people never said them before(source magazine), then he said something about magie simpson and a passifer that didnt even ryhm. Plus his single ""can't deny it"" is a rip off 2PACS - AMBITION AS A RIDAH from All eyez on me. Fab is no lyrisist, maybe he can come up with a few witty things, but then again who cant. The only good lyric he can do is his name which he repeats every song, what trash"
2,I CAN DENY IT!,"Fabolous...Yet another young'un playing dress-up in the thuguniform.How about something more original for a change in mainstream hip hop?OK,I'll admit that while Fabolous(John Jackson) may talk about the same ol',same ol',he comes up with clever lines.But don't most MCs do that anyway?""Ghetto Fabolous"",his debut,is basically what's wrong with mainstream rap.Safe,click-clack beats and rhymes about the ""good life"".Of course,The Neptunes,Rockwilder,and Timbaland had to do production.Yet while,all the aforementioned producers are top of the line,their contributions on ""Ghetto"" are by-the-numbers.Nothing really new or exciting.So the final anayslis stands that judging from this album,it looks like Fabolous really is Mase's evil twin."
3,Above Average,"3 & a half, that's how many stars I would give this if I could. Fabolous isn't the best rapper, but he's not the worst by a long shot. This album has a lot of good songs, but he doesn't really bring anything new to the table. He's pretty much just like any other East Coast rapper."
4,Its A Better Debut Than Was Originally Thought,"Fabolous was a mixtape champion before his debut album, keeping the streets excited with slick lyrics and impressive punchlines. His debut won him many fans but the critics didn't really warm to it. Nevertheless, Fab now is a superstar and though his lyrics don't hit like they used to, he's still deserving of his fame based on his talent. His debut is actually better than it was percieved in the past, proven by one quick look over the hit singles it spawned; ""Holla Back"", ""Can't Deny It"", ""Keeping It Gangsta"", ""Trade It All"", ""Ride For This"". That's nearly half the album. Most artists don't get that close these days, or back then. If you like hot beats and witty lyrics, Fab's debut is a definite winner."
2,fabolous-y,"Fabolous shouldn't have gone commercial straight away, at least with nas and Jay-z, their debut albums kept it raw and let their lyrics do the talking. Fabolous does spit some dime lyrics - these niggas gots to get punch, talk stupid get shells in ya stomach,like you had pasta for lunch - but the production lets the album down. However I do like Fabs flow, and is best heard on One day, my fav track. Click n spark, Keep it Gangsta, are good tracks and this is what Fab should have done wit this album."
2,Groin grabbingly weak,I gave this cd 2.5 stars Because i dont think this cd is that great. I wanna hear somthin that gonna get chu hyped up not no slow downed rap. Some of his songs in my opinion remind me of that rapper common but just not relaxing. The best rap on this cd is the one with nate dogg. now that song is crackin. Also when i hear this cd i hear a voice of the past. (can you say 2pac?)The best songs on the cd mostly have some one eles in it like Ja rule. In other words Fabulous does not show much originality The bottom line is this: dont buy this cd expecting to hear anything equal or greater than the track that was released on the radio.
2,Faboulous What happened???,"This album is very disapointing to me. The best songs on the albums are his singles. This album is very pop oriented and for the streets like it should of been. It's ashamed cause i think this kid has talent but this effort was wak. DJ Clue what happened to u , why u let this happen to F.a.b.o.l.o.u.s.?"
3,Not a Classic But It's Okay!!,"This cd is alright,it has several tracks i'm sure you would like.such as YOUNGIN,a song only for parties,and keepin it gangsta was off the hook.But check it fabolous has got some ill ones like the two hidden tracks at the end of the cd.Those were tyte.Also the one with jagged edge was ill,and several others.I enjoyed this cd and i think you won't be to dissatisfied,but yet and still as with most rappers,he only talks about women and money,pretty boring,but i really think you will like it.hear it for yourself."
2,fab a waste of talent,ok fab is ok. he has to bring it back to the raw mix tape days. he went too commercial on this album.
4,Street,"this cd is good and i don't think i've heard much of a better debut album from any1 cept maybe pac and biggy. The only bad thing about fab is that he needed 2 b on mix tapes instead of just gettin right in he needed help, but his talent is great. most of the songs r good and u could pry crack some windows wit a good sound system."
3,the album was okay,"this album is okay, but i feel that fabolous talks too much about G's when he aint one, i just got this c.d. cuz of trade it all, thats a song that a playa has to have for his lady u naw mean?? if u like fab's flow go and cop the album, but if not then i really dont recomend it."
4,Good...but one of the most overrated and overhyped CDs,"Don't get me wrong, this CD is one of the better ones out there, but it's not as good as most people say. This CD has been hyped ever since Fabolous was in that remix to the Biggie Get Money beat (I forget what the song was called and who it was with), and many people seem to have just bought into it. The people who's reviews simply say ""WOOOOOOWWWW!!!!"" are the same people who probably annoyed you counting down the days and telling you ""I CAN'T WAIT TILL THIS FABOLOUS CD COMES OUT!!!"" everytime you saw them. I knew some of these people. I bet alot of people put 5 stars just because everybody else put 5 stars. But, overall, the CD is pretty good, even though most of the songs sound the same. And I don't understand the people who knock it because he only talks about women, drugs, murder, and money. All rappers do that, what's he supposed to rap about, the stock market? ...You gotta love it, though..."
5,love it love it love it,iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii lllllloooooovvvvveeee iiiiitttttt
2,boo,a really terrible album.......unless you like music designed for teenage girls. i am ashamed to have it in my collection.
3,first 5 months are fantastic,For the first 5 months this was my favorite thing in the world.... it's so lite and amazingly I could put like 3 Cd's worth of music on it... but after 5 months.. it would start to turn off automatically after every time I would run... so now i cant run on the treadmill if i want my music... i have to use the bike or stairmasters intead till i replace this little thing...they say that you're not supposd to get it wet... maybe the sweat is what ruined it...? Great for short term use and if you arent going to get really hot and sweaty....
3,"Not Great, But Not Bad Either...","I must confess that I enjoyed many of these films as guilty pleasures in the 60's, 70's and 80's when going to the movies was a much different experiance than it is today. I saw this as HANNAH, QUEEN OF THE VAMPIRES on a double bill with SIMON, KING OF THE WITCHES, both starring Andrew Prine and I believe both filmed back to back and in some of the same locations. Neither film is a classic, but neither film is all bad either. There is a nice use of location photography here and some fairly good suspense. The story is good, if the performances leave something to be desired. For fans of 70's schlock who have only been able to see this film in badly worn prints on video, the DVD will be a revelation. A good pick for Halloween party viewing or for curling up on a dark stormy night."
3,All English prints are censored,"Don't be fooled, the VCI release may be longer than the public domain CRYPT OF THE LIVING DEAD releases, but it by no means uncut.Every violent sequence has been trimmed to PG levels and the extra blood and gore is intact on the Spanish DVD. About a minute has been cut 3 scenes are affected so while the VCI dvd may be longer, it does not contain the complete film."
2,Careful - this is Young Hanna: Queen of the Vampires,"See reviews for Hanna: Queen of the Vampires. According to IMDB.com, it's the same movie."
2,Hannah - Woman of Few Words,"Hannah does not move more than her eyelids for the first hour. After an hour, she gets out of her coffin and walks around a bit - at times opening her mouth slightly, but never speaking (not one word in the whole movie).The last 10 minutes were okay, but that is only relative to everything up to that point.If this is a movie you saw/liked as a kid, it might be worth a view (thus, 2 stars). Otherwise, best to avoid this as it is boring and doesn't have even any b-movie draw."
4,A pleasing variety of Anna,"There is a nice variety of sets that make this a pleasing video to watch if you are a fan of Anna Nicole Smith. There are scenes of Anna on the farm in a barn. An artsy sort of set and a set of Anna in a 17th Century sort of attire and an enjoyable bathtub scene. All very enjoyable. The only complaint I have is that Playboy tries to get too cute with this video and suggest that Anna is the next Marilyn Monroe by contriving similarities in their looks, upbringing and acting ability. They spend a great deal of time in the video pushing this idea on the viewer. Certainly, Anna is no Marilyn Monroe and I think most astute viewers know the difference. In spite of this shortcoming in the video I would recommend it particularly if you are tired of overly thin models. There really isn't a lot of depth to the video or Anna for that matter but after gazing at Anna for awhile you will probably forget about that."
2,"Anna 5 Stars, Playboy production styles 1 Star","Well, yet another funky trendy 'avaunt-garde' style-over-content production from Playboy. I've never been a fan of theirs but this tape is saved by the presence of Anna Nichole Smith! Even if they film half the sequences in black-and-white and cover them with wierd techno-music or far too loud saxiphones wailing away."
1,nasty doc of anna nicole,"enjoyed the typical rags to riches decent dvd, then she starts gettin naked, and doing gross acts of depravity to herself...i clicked stop button and tossed it into the garbage where it beloged. dont waste your time, and God help u if u r a pervert,and like it.super nasty...."
4,Terrific little product.,It does what it says it will. It keeps the pages securely open and is not difficult to adjust when turning pages.
4,it works,I've only used this with hard cover books so far and it works. I took the rubber tips off the page holder side as recommended by other reviewers and the pages are easier to turn and tuck under. It is more durable than I expected.So far so good!
2,Can server the purpose,I bought two of these items. They are rather small but will work. I'd suggest buying something heavier made if this is for keeping a large pet or small child safe. I will be using them just for cover on my windows since they aren't durable for keeping a pet out. Also you will need your own hardware as I didn't receive any in the box.
3,Screen door grill,"Delivered promptly.Serves it's purpose, but on the flimsy side.Not to be mistaken for the metal grills."
1,Weatherproof Microfiber Men's Jacket,"I have been wearing these Weatherproof jackets for years. This one, ordered through Amazon.com, is junk. After the first washing, both the collar buttons fell off (needed to be re-sewn on). Also, peculiar markings in the fiber near shoulder sleeve appear some how. Washing the jacket removes them, then they magically reappear. Beginning to wonder if this jacket is counterfeit."
3,"Okay, not Good","This jacket is a shell. It looks okay, appears to be waterproof, but it's really a fairly cheap shell, not a jacket. There's no insulation or form to speak of. In no way does this jacket match most of the competitors *cough London Fog cough*. It's inexpensive and built accordingly. So bad I'd return it? No. But I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Disappointed,"I've owned three of these Weatherproof jackets, purchased at retail stores. The jacket I just received from this online source is not the same quality. The construction, fabric, lining, elastic wrist and waist bands are not as good. Also the jacket differs somewhat from the photo. I've really liked these jackets, so I'm disappointed having to return this one."
4,Great Value,"It has performed really well. I use it quite often, but I haven't had a good chance to use it in the rain."
2,Sizing was all wrong,"When I got it and tried it on, it did not fit very well. The sizing of jacket and sleeves seemed funny to me. Not comfortable so I returned it. Amazon was GREAT about the return."
2,Get what you pay for,"I was first disappointed in the stiffness of the so called soft fabric, Compared to Faconnable jacket I bought years ago it is like paper compared to velvet. I also notice the XL seemed a little smaller. The finish of the fabric had scratches on it too. But for only 60 dollars it's an OK jacket but I probably won't be buying cloths online anytime soon again. I was hoping for a bit better than this from Amazon."
4,Great jacket - bit small.,"I like the inside pocket and way it feels. I suggest ordering bigger than you usually wear. I got a large and should have picked X-L, because they run slightly small."
3,shorts sleeves,"this jackets is everything they say, but, there is a problem with it and is that the sleeves are shorts.ex. i'm XL size and when i put on the jacket, the sleeves fit me short.Att. Demetrio Rodriguez"
5,Great gift for the man in your life,I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he had a pull over almost like it and was looking for a jacket. I was so pleased with the item when I received it and my husband was equally impressed. It is not often you can buy something without being able actually touch it first and be this happy with it. Thank you Amazon.
3,Good for collectors,"This is not Howard Shore and no-one should think it is, however I found it a nice addition to my LOTR music collection. I have all the Shore music and it is outstanding - this is interesting, nowhere near as good, but very nice nonetheless. I especially like the soprano Charlotte Kinder on this CD and I would recommend it just for her contribution in some ways I prefer her to Renee Fleming, but that is of course a subjective statement. The other female singer is ok, but nothing special compared to the originals."
3,Pretty Good,"I had real high hopes for the soundtrack cause the movies ROCKED!!! This was a disappointment cause the vocal version of ""Into the West"" ""sucked"" cause the lady sounded like she lost her voice an faded in an out. They should have gotten Enya to do the vocals or AT LEAST the Into the West cause the ldy that sung it made the volume ""suck"" when I thought it would have a BIG finish but instead it had a BIG disappiontment!!!"
4,Broom!,"We got this for my 18 month old daughter, who has had a constant fascination with our broom. She loved it! She plays with it so much. One problem we had was once assembled (the handle) it doesn't always stay together and she is able to get it apart. We solved this by wrapping the two spots the handle slides into with white tape. We have had no problems since."
2,Keeps Falling Apart,"I bought this for my 2yr old son who loves to help clean. The problem is that the broom comes in 2 pieces to form the pole that you hold on to when you sweep. Its not locked into place. So after about 3 sweeps with the broom, the pole/handle comes apart. After about the 3rd time, my son doesn't want to be bothered anymore and frankly I don't blame him. Good concept but until the can either ship it as one piece or have them lock in place I wouldn't waste my money."
4,Silly Sam rocks,"The Silly Sam Talking Broom with Dust Pan was a huge success with my 2-year-old granddaughter. She loves to ""help"" her mom clean-up."
3,"Cute, not really functional","PROS:Super CuteKid-sizeFunny sounds when you press noseCONS:The handle of the broom comes apart (I haven't seen the top half of the broomstick for years, so now it's just a pintsized broomstick).THe dustpan is very small and flat and doesn't hold debris well (My 3 yo daughter tries to use it to sweep her room, but the tiny pieces of paper never make it in the dustpan)Overally, I don't think there's a cuter set anywhere. I just wish they'd make the broom handle as 1 piece and make the dustpan a little larger."
3,toy broom set,"This is a cute toy that can help your young child learn how to sweep with a broom that is kid sized, while having fun. My only concern is that the broom when used says, ""Sweeping"" yet it truly sounds like it is saying, ""Sleeping, sleeping""."
4,"Cute Broom, Annoying voice!","My daughter really likes this broom and dustpan. I bought it for her after she accidentally knocked a bowl off the table with the long handle of my real broom. She loves to help me with the housework and I wanted to encourage that without having her destroy the place! So now we sweep together, each with a broom with the appropriate handle length. Mission accomplished! The downside is that this broom has a really annoying voice that says things like, ""I'M SWEEPING SAM!"" and ""THAT TICKLES!"" (followed by an irritating laugh). It does have an on/off switch though, so that's why it gets 4 stars instead of 3. You can also remove the batteries. A blessing! The other problem we had was that the handle comes in separate pieces and does not hold together well. We fixed it with some super glue and it hasn't been an issue since then."
1,It's a Fake,"Turkey continues to trot this book out every so often trying to disprove Christianity with it. A better book to read that exposes this Muslim conspiracy is Luke Montgomery's A Deceit to Die For. Think Da Vinci Code for Muslims, except it historically accurate."
1,Unreceived order,I have never received my package. I was out of town and have not received it yet...
1,Never received!,This item was purchased but never received. I am very upset as no one is making any effort to help solve this horrible transaction. Ordered 2/22 and this is 3/27...no DVD and my money has been taken. I will never order from Amazon again.Heather Stevens
5,Dvd golden girls,The product Worked wellI Would recommendI Would buy againArrived on time as stated onlineVery Cost effective
2,The Golden Girls Seventh and Final Season,The Golden Girls Seventh and Final SeasonGirls Seventh and Final Season Unfortunately one of the DVD's would not play. That is a disappintment as it was a gift
5,ONE TIME BACK IN ST. OLAF........,"Hi all, if you are reading these reviews , then you must be a glden girls fan. So there isn't much i can tell you to purchase this, any fan must have ALL 7 seasons, and if they think us worthy - maybe Golden Palace someday- but if not thats ok, wasnt that good without bea anyway. Chances are you already have the rest of the season and go ahead and get this one to complete your collection and hang out with the girls and eat some cheesecake while you're at it. = ) A MUST BUY! THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND!!"
5,Great laughter1,"If you wanna be happy, watch the Golden Girls. Not only this season in particular, but all of them. Great, great show!"
5,"Sad, but excellent viewing",Hated to see them go off the air. Betty White has just continued on to make more entertaining programs for us.
5,Wonderful,"Reviewed all the other seasons, and as always, came quickly, as described, and is jam packed full of entertaining episodes of the ladies of Miami."
5,If you love the GG's...,"I have all 7 seasons and I can actually say that the Golden Girls got me through med school. Season seven is wonderful (although tinged with the sadness of it being the end). You'll laugh, you'll cry but most of all you'll be happy you bought season 7."
5,Wish there were more seasons of them.,"I love all of the Golden Girls Season(s) DVD. I never missed any of their shows and am grateful they put them on DVD so I can view and keep them forever. Their humor was very special and touched on a variety of prejudices and stereotypes. They used comedy much like ""All in the Family"". They made their point making fun of the subject matter. Sort of sweetening the medicine with sugar.I will forever love them and cherish the DVDs of their shows. Thanks very much, Ron Caylor"
5,A witty delight,As an avid reader of the works of both Mary McCarthy and Lillian Hellman I found Nora Ephron's play not only witty and insightful but wickedly funny. I'd be happy to see it staged. I read it first to myself and later with a friend who liked it despite knowing next to nothing about the characters on whom it was based.
3,Not great for reading,I think this play needs to be seen on stage. It requires really good actors and good staging to be viable.
2,Imaginary Friends review,"This book is disappointing since it has no real message except that women fight and never forget. So, it is a very negative message that is projected."
1,Imaginary Friends,I didn't care for this book at all. I liked her other books but was disappointed in this one. Mary Pichette
1,Nora Efphron - Imaginary Friends,This is a piece of junk. I threw it in the trash because I would not want to subject anyone else to this rubbish.
5,The best of traditional Irish fiddle music!,This CD is a rare example of traditional music from County Donegal. All the best fiddle players in a very high quality live recording. I own over 150 Irish music CDs and this one is right at the top of the list.
3,Good in parts,"I enjoyed the solo pieces on this album more than the group playing. In my view, this is more of a representation of what you might hear in a good pub session anywhere in the northern counties, or in Dublin, than it is a monumental recording of quality Irish music. And if the former is what you are after then it's OK. However if you are looking for a more serious exposé of the music of Donegal, find something else, perhaps a John Doherty solo recording."
5,amazing,"this is an amazing film. very inspirational, and thought-provoking. it causes one to rethink their life and to aspire to be something more, to have a closer relationship with God. definitely recommend it. it is a must-have in every Christian household"
5,Excellent movie for whole family,This is a heartfelt and moving movie that is a must see for all families. Tragedy which brings life saving hope to the future of our children.
4,Courageous blu ray review,"We love the movie. The blu ray plays fine, but we were very disappointed that there were no special features on the blu ray disc. It had a menu for them on the blu ray - but they were not on the blu ray disc. Very disappointing because they were suppose to be on there and had to watch them on the dvd instead."
2,No sub titles for the hearing impaired,"No sub titles for the hearing impaired. If you love a Promise Keepers theme then you'll love this movie. My wife said she liked the movie. I got extremely bored watching this preachy movie, that is until the sermon, I mean story got to the cops vs bad guys action scene at the very end."
1,bad acting,"this movie has realy bad acting, it is said to be an action movie but has no action at all, is all religion, which is ok but it should be titled under religion. Movie is so slow!"
2,Hearing these high reviews make me want to vomit.,"Listen-I am a Christian. I have accepted Christ in my life, and in my darkest moments, I have turned to him. But this movie is crap. It's banal, boring, poorly acted, terribly written, and directed by someone who probably has never had any directorial talent in him. I'm not reviewing this message-people who do give this movie 5 stars, and they need to sit through an endless repeat of The Godfather until they know the difference between a good and bad movie. But the message is good. But this is a Sunday School sketch, not a movie. 2.5/10"
4,A great movie!,"A very heartwarming story about 4 fathers and their love for their families. The beginning is about the dad's duties as police officers with great action scenes, then it goes into them wanting to become better fathers for their families, seeing how their fathers were with them and the influence a dad can be in their child's life since most of the kids on the street didn't have father figures in their lives. It does speak of their belief in God which they use to get them through tough times in their lives as there are some sad situations that come up in this movie. All the men in this film are great actors. Also the speech at the end was very uplifting by one of the dad's. A great movie that leaves you thinking."
5,VG,"Good movie, maybe the best of the ones that Sherwood has produced. Like the Flywheel story best, but the difference in the production is huge."
4,a little corny but good,"the story line is predictable, but the moral to the story is uplifting and encouraging..good to show young teens the importance of standing up for what you believe in and carrying it out during your life"
5,"Wonderful, yet again!",Alex Kendrick once again brought me to tears more than once in this inspirational movie! The individualized story lines as well as the action will keep you on the edge of your seat. Keep them coming Alex! I will be among many waiting eagerly for your next production!
5,challenged yet again,"I watched this movie with my husband and daughters who are 18 and 22. This movie was such a good example of what a Godly father and husband should be. Thank you to the Kendrick brothers for allowing God to lead them in the making of this movie. We loved ""Fly Wheel"", ""Facing the Giants"" and ""Fire Proof"""
5,Film,More movies of this caliber should be made to encourage men to be better role models for their children and familes. Excellent quality and easy to watch!
5,Hit close to home,Loved this movie- it convicted me of how lightly I take my role in the home. It more importantly reminded me of my heavenly Father and how good He has been to give my Christlike father to me.Five stars without hesitation.
5,Glory to God for a movie designed for the men,"This movie hit the nail on the head for our men as foundations of the family. The woman's role has always been to raise the children but children NEED their dads as well. This movie pointed out a lot of valuable points in making a decision, daring to change a life long trend, and stepping up to the plate instead of singing Lou Rawls tune woulda, coulda, shoulda. It's not too late to make a decision to be that father the children need. I encourage men, women, and children to watch this movie and discuss how each one can make a change for better. God said in Matthew chapter 6, you can't serve Him and money. The family is ordained and blessed by God and He is a primary need in our life in order to make it through every situation and providing for all our needs. Be bless as you watch this movie."
5,Canaanland,Ex lent movie full of humor action love . A great display of character. It is good to see more movies about Jesus .
5,dvd,"Remarkable movie by ""non-professional, non-Hollywood"" Christian independent filmmakers! Packs a great message wrapped around a riveting story told with both dram and humor."
5,Highly recommend,Great movie and highly recommend. Good men's bible study movie. Great study guide . Our church uses it for that.
5,A must see for any Father,"If you want to be a good father to your children, then this movie will inspire you to be that ""Great Dad"" that is deep within you. A must see for any parent."
5,Fantastic movie,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. It was uplifting, encouraging, motivating, and refreshing! Highly recommended! The importance of fathers has been minimized since the ""feminist movement"", and the result has been devastating to families. We have left men feeling lost and unsure of what their role is in this modern society. This movie reminds us of the powerful influence for good that fathers can and should be for their wives and their children. I did not find it preachy at all."
5,Courageous Movie review,"I heard about the movie on a christian radio show and decided to make it a girl's day out treat. The movie completely blew us all away! We cried , We clapped, We cheered, We laughed and most of all We praised God. The movie should be watched by entire families, not just men. I plan on buying everyone I know one for Christmas this year. I wish that every young person thinking of getting married would watch this movie before doing so.I thank God that the people who put this together on the big screen did so. They also brought the matter of salvation up in a natural way that I feel will help people who are seeking God get saved. Thank you! Watch it. If you never see another movie this year, be sure to see this one!"
5,"A must see, must own movie!","I just came from watching this awesome movie at the theater. Its one that all husbands and fathers should see. What an inspiring message it holds that really goes to the core of family essentials. It will make you laugh, cry, and touch your heart in so many ways. I cant wait until its available for purchase."
5,Amazing.,"Moving, funny, tearjerker, awesome. We need more movies like this one. I loved it. Wish more men would stand up and be accountable, Faith filled leaders. It inspired me to strive for a deeper walk and more accountability in my life. We have a serious Father vaccume in this world and we all are suffering for it, especialy our children. I also love how The movie shows God's provision in miraculous ways."
5,This is my Movie!!,"This is an awesome movie from start to finish, it's teaches about fatherhood, and men standing up to their responsibility as men, being examples.. This is a must see!!"
5,Man! I love this movie.,"Great acting, great production values, powerful story. Every male needs this for encouragement, and the challenge it presents. One of our favorite movies ever."
5,Fantastic!!!,"Such a great story, acting, and film. My new favorite movie. It's funny, sad, dramatic, and inspiring. I had t buy it the first day it came out because I was so excited to see it again. It's a wonderful family movie."
5,RETO DE VALIENTES,"Reto De Valientes (Courageous) [NTSC/Region 1 and 4 dvd. Import - Latin America] Audio Espanol, Ingles y Frances (Subtitles: English, French, Tailandes).THE PLOT THIS GOOD IS WORTH. HURTS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH WHAT WAS SAID ON THE COVER BECAUSE ONLY COMES IN ENGLISH AND NOT IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGE."
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!,"Saw it today. Just like ""Flywheel"", ""Facing the Giants"", and ""Fireproof"", this is one of the best movies ever made. All father's should see this movie. Our court system should require dead beat dads see this movie as part of their court appearance. Mr Kendrick, you are a saint!"
5,Excellent movie,"Enjoyed this family oriented film, definitely carries a good message in this one. It probably is not for everybody since it does lean towards religion and all, but a little religion never hurt nobody...besides there is a great message and a easy family watch. Recommended."
5,Uplifting Christian movie that should resonate among any real man!,"This movie is another in the stable of the people who did fireproof and facing the giants, and I have to say that this might be there best one yet. It offers a believable tale and a God-center response. To me, this made it a little bit more real world than the other two movies. All of them were good, but this one just seems more authentic than the others. Plus, by this installation the acting is much, much stronger than in the previous movies as well. The script it really great and their call to act as real men of God is much more moving (to me) than some of the other messages. All in all, anyone could profit from watching this movie. Get it and be enlightened."
4,inspiring,"Great movie, thanks for putting this on.I would love to see more of these movies, also if you need material that is true and inspirational please contact ""new life community Church in chicago"" we have many stories.p.s. I enjoyed the interracial relationships portrayed in this movie.p.s. II please make a little more effort in actors that speak Spanish, it was a little corny. sorry for being critical hope it helps to make the future movies more realistic."
5,Inspiring in a new way!,"This is a winner! Action, unexpected events, humor, and most importantly an amazing message built into a vulgar free full length well done movie. My heart was racing throughout...for various reasons. It left me feeling motivated to ensure I wasn't a ""good enough"" parent...but instead reach for the courage to take seriously the gift God has blessed me with by properly parenting my 2 beutiful children.This movie was terrific...clearly sending a much needed message in a VERY loving way. Yes, it has many plots going on...but it made sure most people's scenarious were included..and even for those fathers not making the grade...it has a powerful message that it is never to late and that you are an equal to all of us! For God will be our lone judge...not each other. WELL DONE MOVIE!Hobbys and our jobs have no eternal impact...but the souls of our children do..and that is a motivating thought!"
5,Must See,Every dad must watch this powerful film. We take so mucyh for granted as parents and this movie motivates me to the right kind of Christian Dad to my girls!
5,Please see this movie,"You need to see this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please support this movie in the theater and show Hollywood that when we are given the opportunity to see quality Christian movies that we will support it with our box office dollars. This movie will touch you, challenge you, and cause you to want to hold those dear to you just a little closer. God is amazing and He is glorified in this movie."
5,Amazing,No doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen. My brother sent this to my husband with a note to watch it and pass it on to another Dad. We both LOVED it. Definitely need tissues but as corny as it sounds this movie can change the way you live. I am buying a copy to keep and lend out (but be sure I get back) as I know we will want to watch this again as a reminder. Excellent movie with a message.
5,"Screw your courage to the sticking place, and you'll not fail","This is the best from the Kendrick brothers to date. Heartfelt, riveting, and glorifyingGod at the same time. Awesome!"
5,A GREAT MOVIE EXPERIENCE,"THIS IS THE KIND OF MOVIE THAT EVERY FATHER HAS TO WATCH AT LEAST ONCE , GREAT VIDEO GREAT MOVIE !!!"
5,Courageous,"A must see movie. If you haven't viewed it, you don't know what your missing. A message of hope rises to the screen in these uncertain times. Loved it. Seen it several times. Bought several copies and gave them away."
4,What is really important?,This movie centers around the main theme of Jesus Christ first and then family second. I like the way the movie set the scene for the importance of family and to make every day count. Some parts of the movie were a little corny but that is what happens when non-movie maker put together a movie and that is why I gave it a 4.
4,Good show for family and teens,I liked the movie. My 4 year old likes to watch it he want to be a police man. Good show to remind us what is important and that life can be way too short.
1,yet another church-funded christian propaganda film,"yet another church-funded christian propaganda film that is just fantasy, no need for this fluff, it will melt the brain of any rational thinker"
1,Don't waste your time.,"Rented this and even though it was only a buck, it was still too much. Terrible acting, terrible plot, absolute waste of time."
1,I knew God loved me before I saw this movie,"god, god god god god god god god...............god god god God. Further let me say, father, father God, god the father. This movie had less than one dimension. If you want to share your Lordly experience through a movie, this is for you. If you are looking for plot, acting, sublties, complexity (I am sure a gang banger can know God as well as a cop), try Doubt."
1,If youre gay stay away!,"Wow. Saw this with my bf just to hoping to see Kirk Cameron with his shirt off and hes not even in it! Not only that but all of these cops are completely clothed for the entire movie. Save yourself some pain and just get left behind. Plenty of ""touching"" moments in that one if you know what I mean."
2,sappy,"Couldn't even watch it. Bad acting,very slow paced.Watched about 30 minutes and had to turn it off.Review sounded much better than it was."
3,Great idea gone astray,"I sat down to watch Courageous with great anticipation. Being a father of 2 boys, and being divorced, I know how important it is to be present for them. I was looking for this movie to provide positive affirmation of this reality. While the movie is heart wrenching, I openly wept, it fails miserably on hitting those that need the message the most. Divorced fathers. The movie producers chose to make the divorced father the villain. By trying to push two separate agendas, fatherhood and marriage, they lost a perfect chance to hook divorced fathers. You don't have to be married to make the ""Resolution"" to your children and God, presented in the movie. They could have easily switched a few characters around and this movie would have been a home run. All fathers would do well to make this resolution a reality in there lives. All in all I liked the movie but can't give it even four stars because of the lost opportunity to affect those that need it most."
2,Courageous,"The idea of this movie is great and message is well taken... But did not like that women played little role in christian life as stated, and too much preaching (even though I am a christian, I feel the preaching was too much and unreal)."
3,Good meaning.,"This movie has great meaning to it but to me personally, who isn't a believer in god is too religious for me. If anything, this movies make god seem even more made believe.. it makes me feel god is entirely made up for people to remain sane in emotional stress implying if he didn't exist.. they would do something bad to themselves. After all, no one has ever been able to prove he is real. How is god a he anyways? who made that part up? Haha.Overall, decent movie but too religious.I won't lie, I enjoyed it though.(Purposely refuse to capitalize god for all the Nazi grammar people)"
3,A tutorial on how to be a good christian father,"This movie is basically a tutorial on how to be a good christian father.Lots of preaching and giving you advise on what is wrong , what is right. Besides that there are few impressive scences that show the battle between cops and drug dealers.Overal a good movie, I would have given it 5 stars if there were less boring preaching and advising scenes and more of action that a police job requires."
3,This is a movie for people who are already in the faith,"I think there are very redeemable elements to this movie. It was a good message with practical application. What I wish was different is that Christian films often seem to need to put in awkward dialog in an effort to clearly reiterate the ""lesson"" in each scene. A really great film always shares the story, and then let's the audience come to their own conclusion. In Courageous, it's as if there's a fear that if they don't tell the audience what the lesson is, they'll miss it. Christian films need to let stories stand on their own to make a point. If the story can't do that, then they aren't the right stories, or situations. Christians will love this movie because everything is scripted in their own language (and I am a Christian so I know the verbiage). The story in Courageous is compelling on it's own, without the ""here's what this means"" parts."
5,Excellent,"Delivery was fast as promised, in great condition (like new), played fine, and the movie is awesome. Every father and family member should see this movie."
5,have a hankie ready,"I had seen the previews and heard about this movie from friends before watching it, so I was already aware of the content. This is a great movie to remind you of the order of priorities, making tough decisions, surrounding yourself with supportive people & making decisions now for your life, so life doesn't zip by & you are faced with regret. This is a great movie for tweens to grandparents, especially new & growing families. It lights a fire to be intentional about your family."
5,Courageous by Alex Kendrick,"This is a most see DVD for families with sons. Questions such as How do I behave as a husband, father, friend are easily portrayed by realistic situations which confront basic human values. It is realistic, compassionate and humorous."
2,Movie Critique,"Its funny how most of the reviews (and I have read a large portion of them) are not really a critique of the movie itself but about how one feels about Christianity. Most non-believers gave the movie a low rating simply because it was a Christian film, while the professing Christians gave it a high rating merely because it is Christian. I have been a sold out disciple of Christ Jesus for 21 years and in all honesty this was NOT a great movie, decent, but not great. The message was clear and timely, but the mediocore acting, poor character development, unrealistic plot points (there were a few), and general oversimplifications makes it less than exemplary entertainment. I understand that a world that is at emnity with God makes it challenging to produce quality Christian entertainment, but for believers to give every Christian endeavor a thumbs up is disingenuous; it makes others question the validity of other matters, including those of faith."
2,wasn't a bad movie just way to much church and god talk,I love cop movies and this one looked good. wasn't bad however I am not a beliver in churches and this movie was all about that. the characters preach to eachothers non stop and it just pisses me off when movies do that.
5,Action and Family Drama,"Courageous is a movie every father should see. It is the best movie on fatherhood I've ever seen. It affected me deeply and I felt that the message of hope was profoundly moving. I was seriously close to tears the entire movie except for the funny parts. I'd laugh and then go right back to feeling like I was going to burst into tears. It was a total emotional rollercoaster but one that left me grateful for my own father's roll in my life. I think this movie appeals to such a wide audience because each father in the movie is in a different situation. One is unemployed for a while, another experiences a tragic loss and one reconnects with his child in a meaningful way. This movie also has lots of action and family drama. Believe the good reviews - this movie is amazing.~The Rebecca Review"
5,"Full of emotion, really well-done....laugh, cry, rejoice","Seeing that it was more than a two hour movie, I figured half way through I would get some food and drink to carry me on to the end.......but! this touching film captured my spirit so that I didn't want to waste a moment on mundane things. After suffering severe trauma recently, this remarkable film has released emotions in me that needed to be untrapped. Much feeling in this message, a realness, an invitation to looking beyond ""what feels good"" to grasping hold of what really is good and right. Integrity, where have you been? We have missed you in the gaudy, the impure, the ""me-first"", the mocking of the upright and saluting the depraved. For the first time in a while, I feel clean after watching a real and exciting as well as very well-done movie."
4,wholesome family movie,"I absolutely loved this movie. If you liked the movies ""Remember the Giants"" anf ""Fireproof"", you will also want to add this to your collection."
5,Great for fathers and soon to be fathers.,This was an excellent movie. I purchased it so I could watch it over and over. Every father needs to see this so they can be a role model for their kids. Teenage boys need to watch it as well!!
5,Fantastic Movie! Shipped on time,"We saw this movie a couple of months ago and we absolutely loved it. Even though it's a Christian film, the lessons about parenthood are great for everyone so we decided to buy a few and send to our closest relatives and friends.As for service, nothing to complain. We received the shipping on the date it was indicated at the time of purchase."
4,You Know What... This Is a Good Movie,"As a staunch Christian AND an avid film fan, I haven't been thrilled with Sherwood's past offerings. Nothing against the group... I love what they stand for and what they're trying to do, I just haven't liked the movies all that well. That being said, I went into ""Courageous"" with low expectations but an open mind. From the opening sequence to the final speech, this is BY FAR Sherwood's best film, and one of the better inspirational dramas in recent years. Sure, some of the acting was subpar and the script had a few blatantly fundamentalist plants... but I was genuinely moved and touched by this film, and I think you will be too."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!,EVERY HUMAN WITH CHILDREN SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE. IT WAS AMAZING! OUR WHOLE WORLD WOULD CHANGE IF YOU BUY THIS FOR EVERYONE YOU KNOW WHO HAS CHILDREN OR WHO PLANS TO...
2,Poopaganda,"I gave it a 2 because it seemed interesting at first and then just went into a boring spiral of bad acting, cliches, and mid-afternoon drunk drivers. A christian shouldn't have to rely on poorly made movies to receive meaningful messages. A bad movie is a bad movie. Doesn't matter if it's of the christian or secular nature. Bottom line, make better movies."
1,Worst kind of tripe,"Insulting, condesending, preachy. Painful to watch, avoid at all costs. So bad I could only watch the first 30 minutes even though I was stuck on an airplane."
2,Preachy,Just another film trying to make a few bucks off morals. Give it a pass unless that is up your alley.
4,CALLING ALL MEN...WATCH IT!!!,"Ok, I saw this in the theater and as a Christian I always go to support these films and always gain so much from them. This one is by far my favorite hands-down. I had no idea of the story line going in and was weeping (yes I'm man enough to admit that - smile) and so encouraged and inspired as a man. At the end you want to stand up and SHOUT! As a Christian I pray and hope that when I get married and have kids that I'm this kind of Husband and Father. America needs more of this, the world needs more of this. REAL MEN! Not perfect but trying and striving.I highly recommend that all MEN take time to watch this regardless if you are young or old, married or single, a parent or not one yet. Watch this film to inspire your life, call to your manhood and encourage your soul for what you should be always reaching up for.ENJOY!!! ;)"
5,Best Movie of the year,"This movie is the top of the line quality for a wholesome, good ole movie with Christian values and morals. Alex Kendrick writing was sensational, emotional-gripping, and spiritual moving with a hint of action, family values, and comedy with drama all in one package. He gave just enough dose where you laughed, you cried, and you smiled, or tugging at your heart but you learned the most important value: men to rise to their rightful place as the Bible commands them. More importantly, others to hold them accountable and to enrich these values in their children, and other children who may have lost a parent or doesn't have a guardian at all. Thank you! I even encouraged my father to watch it and make such a vow unto God. And raise up daughters to be respectful young ladies and know what to see in their future husband because of looking at their greatest role model: their dad who exemplifies Christ.Adrienna TurnerAuthor of ""The Day Begins with Christ"""
5,Resolution of Faith,"After watching this during Movie Night at my church, I have to give a three warnings. First there is some violence which I'm sure is the reason for the PG-13 rating. Second, have tissues or a handkerchief close at hand. Third, it helps if you are a Christian or at the very least open-minded about Christianity.Four of the main characters are Law Enforcement Officers. Some have faith and others don't. A series of events leads them to make a resolution. This resolution tests the courage of their convictions. There is action, adventure, intrigue, faith, and even some laughs thrown in.One more thing, you may think there are some unnecessary moments but if you watch the whole movie, you see how all the pieces fit together like a giant puzzle."
3,"Great movie, really terrible digital copy!","If you buy this version of the movie thinking you're also getting a digital copy, you'll be sadly mistaken. The UltraViolet digital copy will not load into iTunes or the Kindle app. You would think with the number of DVDs being purchased on the decline the movie studios would make it easier for their customers but unfortunately this is not the case. After over an hour of trying to put this movie on my iPad I have finally emailed Ultraviolet's tech support group.I have two other movies I was considering buying which also have UV digital copy but wanted to try it with this movie first. No way am I going down this road again. I'll wait to catch them on Redbox instead. BUYER BEWARE!!!**Update**Just received a response from Ultraviolet's tech support group: ""I am sorry but yes ultra violet does not work with downloading to ipads however in some cases the retailer may give you a itunes code but you would have to contact them directly."""
2,OK movie,"I always enjoy a movie about personal salvation and the ability to change, and I suppose that if religion is what's required to coerce some men to become better fathers then more power to it. Two things, though, that really troubled me was the patriarchal nature of the film and the corresponding female subordination, and the one father dictating to his daughter that it's his role to choose a proper husband for her."
1,In a word: Horrible,"Can a movie bludgeon you to death with mediocre acting, poor production values and steep you in more sophomoric Christian-based proselytizing? This movie is worse than The Green Lantern, and I didn't think that was possible.... Well, ok, they both made me laugh out loud, but I object to having lost an hour and a half of life (before I deleted the movie without being able to stomach watching any more) that I'll never, ever get back. I'm not going repeat what others said who gave this one star, since I agree with their assessments..... 'Nuff said."
1,Hallmark moment,This flick would have been a fail on TV. I felt like I was watching a Christian Channel Flick. It was filled with pledges to love Jesus blah blah. Horrible and not worth paying $1.00 for. Poor cast. Poor story. If you're a right wing christian you will love it. I hated it.
1,Karate teacher,A pretty bad movie if you think people in the US are like this you must be in oz land talking to Dorthy . all i saw was a bunch of male bashing. telling men how bad they are . if you work and take care of your family you are doing good not all of us are Dr Phil.
1,awful,This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. It was horrible! I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless it was free.........but then be prepared to be bored.
4,Watch if You Have Kids (or want to have kids),"This is the best quality film that these brothers have released. The script/acting is good. This is not, as the other films they have released, a Hollywood Blockbuster, but it is entertaining and definitely thought provoking. Based on the Christian faith, this movie shows what a difference the man of the family can make when raising kids. It is not easy, but oh so important. I think that all parents should watch this movie. You may think that you are doing a good job at raising your family, but when you watch this, you see things in a different light. I laughed and cried in this movie and have purchased it for our adult children who are beginning their families."
5,"Astonishing in scope, spiritually uplifting and challenging","I have seen the Kendrick Brothers' previous 3 Sherwood Pictures: Flywheel, Facing the Giants, and Fireproof. Each of those deals with one major theme. In Flywheel it is honesty, in Facing the Giants it is faith, and in Fireproof it is sacrificial love. This one delves into much more territory in about the same amount of time, all within a very complex story. You would not expect a story about several Christian policemen's lives to be as complex as it is. From a message on the need for fathers to be more actively involved in shaping their children, the movie delves into messages of honesty and reaching out to the community. It is the most intense of their 4 movies so far. (My favorite is Fireproof.) The way this one packs so many themes into a story, at such a deep level, shows the Holy Spirit was behind the project. The themes are the basis for the story, rather than an afterthought! As always, Alex and Stephen Kendrick use great humor."
5,Godly fathers are essential,"Saw this movie with my whole family and am praying that God will use this for His glory. It is well made, and with a message that is so necessary today which if taken to heart and acted upon, we as a country could fix a lot of our problems. I highly recommend it but make sure you bring some tissue."
5,Courageous,Excellent movie. Could not wait to receive my copy and share with family and friends. Was privledged to see it the movie theater and then came on line to see whether I could order it pronto. Ended up pre-ordering and was advised when it was ready. Wow!
5,wow!!,This is a film worthy of consideration by all families desiring to influence their parents/children for Jesus Christ.Good role models.
4,Manhood & fatherhood,Daddies who know what real manhood and fatherhood csn be like: fun & responsible in leading their family.Movie is full of action combined with heart and humor!Never experienced this before when watching a movie in theatre: at some point all spectators laughed out loud and had tears in their eyes... ;)
5,Great movie,"Courageous is a movie all families, especially dad's, should watch. This a great movie, and with this retailer, at a great price."
5,Courageous is a GREAT movie!,"I bought the movie, Courageous, because I first saw it in the movie theater and thought, ""WOW, more movies ought to be made this way!""It is an excellent movie for men, but women will love it too! It truly teaches Christian values and how to talk the talk and walk the walk! A must own movie!"
4,Great story line,This DVD is very good for the entire family. It moves right along in the story line and has excellent Christian values that we all need to be reminded of periodically.
5,Must see-AWESOME!!!,"AWESOME!! Alex Kendrick and Sherwood Pictures hit a home-run, yet again, with this, their fourth Christian-themed movie. This one concerns fathers and the important rolls they play in the lives of their children and how a lack of an adequate roll model can leave really negative effects on them and how, if fathers will step up to the plate and commit to doing all they can for and with their children, it will have a have a positive and encouraging effect on them that will go a long way in enabling both sons and daughters to succeed in life. Two thumbs WAY UP for a great movie!"
5,Men must see!,"I had seen fireproof,flywheel,facing the giant's so i thought this would be pretty good but turns out it is a life changing movie ALL men need to see .It was good to have it on reserve with amazon ,got it quick with no effort."
5,Courageous,"The family loved it, every young person should watch it before they even think of having a child. I know that the school don't teach anything."
5,Awesome Family Movie,"I first saw this movie at the theater, if you are parent this movie is a must see. It will challenge you to be a better parent."
4,Great!,Movie was great! It has a great story and inspirational. Only problem is the acting but that is as expected. I cried it was touching! We rented it .
5,What the world needs,"My husband and I just watched this movie for date night. This movie had action, adventure, tragedy, and a happy ending. I most enjoyed that there was a positive Christian message. I walk away from this movie wanting to become a better wife and mother."
4,Courageous,I enjoyed this film -- adjudicating Christian principles with civil service. I would recommend this as a great discussion starter.
5,Courageous,"Best movie I have ever seen, everyone over 12 years old needs to see it. Families would benefit seeing it together."
4,Small town dreams,"An excellent small film with a very strong performance by CarlLumbly and extended cameos by Amy Madigan and in a negative role as the philandering Father/Doctor, a too long missing from feature films, Robby Benson.Another in a long line of ""summer coming of age films,"" showcasing a small town (Nevada) twelve year old who gets a part time job in a local saloon. Befriended by a wise mechanic (African American wonderfully portrayed by Lumbly), and a wise cracking bartender ( a Native American); the film centers on the boy who (entering the seventh grade) is forced to grow up admidst parents who are unable to communicate and surrogate adults who are wise, tolerant, and nuturing.Learning to drive and realize dreams is a wonderful sub plot.Well crafted and highly recommended. A Showtime film for television."
1,White men are bad news???,"The movie was a sweet story about adorable young white boy growing up in rural NV in 1960. In this story his doctor dad is good for nothing, selfish liar. There is a nasty good for nothing, lowlife, drunken bar regular (who incidently is a white guy). The only other white guys I recall having more than one sentence in the movie (and it may have been collectively) were the film makers who (of course) looked and sounded in general to be a disagreeable lot.The boy spends his summer in a saloon with two male role models from which he gains wisdom and maturity. One a likeable, not overly intellegent Native American with a big heart. The other, the star of the show, portrayed as a very wise, sensitive and caring African-American man who helps the boy through the rough patches.What was the message this movie is really trying to convey?It seemed pretty thinly vailed to me."
4,Don't be an ugly American,"Short, easy lessons on the bare essentials. It even has a short section on what kind of French wine to order with your dinner. Good for brushing up for a trip to France. It's not going to help you in every situation, but you'll be treated a lot better if you're at least trying to speak their language."
4,Not for meditation but relaxation,"Inspiring and beautiful music. AS it is moving, it may distract your meditation, but it is definitely good for your resting time."
5,Love It,"First time to enjoy his music, and am glad I picked this album to experience Paul Cardall. It's worth a listen."
2,Faithful,I have mixed feelings regarding this artist. Some of the songs were enjoyable and filled me with serene emotions; while other songs I didn't care for. It wasn't what I expected; not sure how to describe other than I was mildly disappointed that I purchase this particular CD by Paul Cardall.
2,Disappointing,"This book,s condition was much poorer than I anticipated. It had a water stain on the front cover and smelled of mold. I will explain to my son on Christmas morning. I am sure he will chuck it. On the plus side it came on time."
2,worked well...........but not any more,"I received this at christmas, it made good stiches, but a few weeks ago it would stop making stiches, I will be buying a more expensive machine, if I were you, you should not buy this and spend a little more on a good machine."
1,Horrible,"Like in many of the other reviews i have had the same problems. Crooked stitching, broken thread every time i tried to correct the stitching, can not sew many types of thick or thin fabric, setting are very fast when plugged in and way to slow when operating on new batteries. Was using it to sew simple little dolls but it broke after maybe 5 uses and cannot get a replacement like promised with warrant when i purchased it."
3,the dressmaker that couldn't,"i bought this machine because I am novice and have very limited storage space. For the first few garments I made, the machine was fine. I loved the size but then it all went badly. Thread breaking, the bobbin basically bounces out and binds the entire machine. If you are only using this to do the most basic mending...well, you are still better of doing them by hand. This would make a fine toy"
1,breaks easily,This sewing machine broke within a couple of uses. I probably worked less than 6 hours on it before it stopped working. It comes with very clear directions for many issues but the troubleshooting steps did not help me to fix the problem.
4,Not Quite What I Expected,"The machine is quite small. A great machine to travel with or for small projects, but definitely not made for a large task. It is very easy to use and comes already to go."
2,Disappointed,"I was suppose to be getting this sewing machine as an early xmas present. I'n new to sewing and don't have a lot of storage so it was the perfect gift. However, like another review while sewing for the first time after about a half hour the tension knob popped out and then every few minutes after that continued to pop out. Then while changing the bobbin something must have happened because it did not sticht right after that even though I followed the directions(which are useless)and consulted veteran sewers. My mother, who bought it for me was disappointed and isn't sure if she can even return it. However, I did sew most of a large blanket and hem one leg of a pant before it no longer worked. I'd go the next step up if possible"
1,ITS TOO FRAGILE,"Thinking its small & light in weight, I purchased the product.But later I discovered the other unmentioned qualities.It cant do stitches on the clothes that are a little thick,so forget about using it on Denim jeans.While stitching, the threades get tangled every often.And entangling it will be equal to tearing your cloth apart because there are no ways out to have any access into the inside mechanism of the machine.Neither can one see inside in order to entangle the knots that have been caused inside.So please dont waste your money in order to save it.Its good for kids who wish to stitch frocks for their dolls."
3,OK quality for little money,"If you're looking for a quick little sewing machine to do the job for very little money, this is the deal for you.A little difficult to get it running the first time, no guides on the side to follow for width or straightness, and the directions were a little lacking.But it does do the job. It sews. You just need a little patience with this one."
2,Defective or just not a good product?,"I had such a terrible time with mine, I am returning it. The thread would not stay threaded right no matter what I did. But the biggest problem was that the screw holding in the needle will not hold it in. It won't tighten enough to keep in the needle. So I kept fixing it and it kept falling out. I struggled with this machine for almost an hour over multiple issues. Finally I am giving up. I will stick to my good old Singer."
1,"This machine is not worth buying, it is horrible!.","This machine is not worth buying, it is horrible!. Yeah it does stich but not for any use. I am not able to change the bobbin. Instruction manual is in spanish, I have to learn spanish to read that!. Please DO NOT BUY IT"
3,Dressmaker,"For mending - it is great, it's small and lightweight. I have not tried it on a large project yet."
3,"Not great, not bad- just not worth it.","I definately thought this would be a great beginner sewing machine- and it is per say, but after using it for about two months, I broke the needle, had to replace it and found that it totally wasn't working anymore. It won't sew a thing now- and I'm really annoyed!! I bought this machine regardless of the fact that it had gotten some bad reviews, and now I totally regret it. I was using it to sew jersey material and such and it bunched up the fabric, came unthreaded constantly, and refused to sew more then two layers of any fabric whatsoever. I didn't expect it to be great, so I guess I can't complain too much- I just wish I could get my $30 bucks back. It's definately great if you're a beginner, and you're just hemming things, but there's no way it could seriously handle more than that. No way at all- trust the reviews, this many people can't be wrong."
4,Euro-Pro 1100 dress maker II --worth all the $ we paid,We were looking for a small sewing machine for stiching our new curtain ends and our buttons and other small stiching works ... We got Europro 1100 for less than 30$. Its been two months and we are still stiching big time.. Its all worth for small projects.
2,For basic sewing or for kids,"I could pretty much use this sewing machine for basic stuff..It was obvious that thicker fabric, like denim, wouldn't work well with this machine, and I was right. The really bad thing about it was defintely the fact that the thread was not of good quality, it gets tangled around 40-50% of the time, and there is no way of going ""inside"" the machine.I bought the dressmaker thinking I was taking an easy way out and saving a couple of bucks...But to be honest, this is for quick fixs and/or kids. If you have a kid just starting out, then this is for them. If have anything simple to fix, with straight stitching, this is also for you. ANYONE ELSE: SAVE YOUR MONEY and put it towards a sewing machine that'll last long, and that will do the work right!"
1,Maybe I got a lemon but.....,"When I adjusted the tension tight enough to equalize the stitches, top and bottom, the thread began to break. I could not pull the fabric away from the machine in order to clip the threads without hand pulling the upper thread. When running on batteries the machine's speeds were medium-slow and medium. When the power was plugged in it ran at very fast and extremely fast. Had a great deal of difficulty in reverse. Kept stopping and chugging."
1,Horrible Decision,"I also bought this because of the low price, portability, and accessories. The product description seemed to make it seem as if it would sew properly, when in fact, it barely sews at all. It is so lightweight, that it literally moves all over the table when running, due to the vibration. The stitches are inconsistent, because the tension is perpetually off and the thread breaks often. All of this, combined with the fact that the machine is so TINY that you can't sew any fabric of any size at all...I am so upset over purchasing this product, but I can't send it back since I've used it.NO STARS. DON'T BUY THIS SEWING MACHINE!"
3,Good price but bad quality!!!,"For the price of the Euro-Pro, it's not too bad. At first it was very hard to set the stitch so that it would look nice both side. You have to have the same type of cloth that you're sewing to test otherwise it might not come out okay. It can handle thick cloth up to a certain level. It definitely can't handle jeans. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless price is an issue for you. I'd recommend buying something like 2-3 steps up if you're a little bit concerned about quality. This Euro-Pro is definitely something you don't want to use when you have some serious sewing. It can't handle it and you'll get so frustrated with it before you're half way with your project."
5,A MUST Read for Anyone in Management,"I bought this book on second thought because I was also buying ""Leading Change"" by Kotter. However, I picked up this book and could not put it down. As a long-time leader, this book validates much of what I already know and do. However, it also brings a lot of insight into the differences between leadership and management. The author really analyzes the complexity and interdependency and interrelationships that are faced by, and must be overcome or managed by leaders and managers. I liked what and how Kotter says it in this book that I bought one for each of my managers (I'm a CEO). I am hoping that this easy-to-read, and understandable book brings a lot of insight to them. I highly recommend this book to all current leaders and managers, and anyone hoping to go into leadership or management or both."
2,Almost completely non-informative,"This book contains John Kotter's usual dose of platitudes and blindingly obvious insights. Anyone that gets anything useful out of this book is far too dumb to lead anything at all, except perhaps a hollow and meaningless life.How he has gotten the world to swallow this nonsense book after book, each one a rehash of his previous mishmash of meaningless business speak (""energizing your employees"") and vague, unfollowable axioms about, for example, ""having vision,"" is beyond me. But perhaps I just haven't achieved my full alignment potential."
2,disappointing,not enough in depth and insider information. the cd was amateurish and weak. Pretty much a rip-off
2,General Information,"I was disappointed with Amy Holman's An Insiders Guide To Creative Writing Programs. Where is the inside information? The book is basically a list of schools and programs, each listing containing non-critical information gleaned from web sites. There are no critical assessments here regarding funding, admissions, etc., which tends to equalize and generalize each entry leaving me unable to point myself in any direction. I bought Tom Kealey''s Creative Writing MFA Handbook at the same time (five stars) and love it. If you have your own list, Kealey's book, the internet and some self direction you don't need this book."
2,It would be better if it was sold as advertised,"The book is a very decent reference but it is very limited. The book description even states there are only 80 reviews total in the book and that includes universities, colonies and international programs. What sold me on the book was the CD that expanded the reviews to include over 300 programs. Well, the CD doesn't work. Amazon has replaced my original book/cd and the second one doesn't work either. There are three other reviews of this book that say the same thing. THE CD DOESN'T WORK. It is false advertising and the book/cd should be recalled by the publisher. If you have also bought this defective product send an email to Amazon to put pressure on the publisher to fix the problem. If you haven't bought it, DON'T until the publisher fixes the problem."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I bought this book after reading the positive reviews on the site. I was very disappointed by the MFA listings. I looked to this book to give me something other than what I could find on a quick website search of the college. Financial aid, among other things, is one especially murky topic that is hard to find out about quickly. I assumed that buying this book would give me information I'd otherwise have to look long and hard to find. Well, in the case of the MFA section at least, that isn't the case. The stuff that's hard to find on the website, is the stuff that's missing from the book! I was not impressed."
3,Good album,"This is a good collection of rock songs, and Johnnie Van Zant has a good hard rock voice. The songs are primarily Country-hard rock with some gospel influences. This was my first Lynyrd Skynyrd album and I can say it's a nice album, it has a positive attitude lyrically and this version of the band does know how to rock."
4,Still rockin'!,"Having seen the band three days before the 1977 crash, I wasn't sure if I wanted to hear any ""new"" music from the band without Ronnie, Steve, and Cassie; but I shouldn't have been concerned. This CD rocks with the best of them. Although the lyrics don't seem as genuinely down-home and authentic as ones from earlier years, the music still holds up. From rockers to ballads the band shines. Skynyrd can hold their own with the best of them. If you like the band, you'll enjoy this album. ""Keeping The Faith,"" ""Backstreet Crawler,"" and ""End Of The Road"" are my favorite cuts."
3,Better than you'd think,"This album, the first newly written material following the bands tribute tours in 87 and 88, is much better than some reviews have said when looked at in an objective fashion. If one compares it to Street Survivors, it might not stack up, but it's actually a fine rock and roll album.Keepin the Faith is an excellent cut, and Smokestack Lightning and Backstreet Crawler are classic Skynyrd guitar attacks.Pure and Simple is probably the standout track. There are some tracks that might be overproduced, but for a first new album from a band recovering from a tragic plane crash, it is worth having."
5,Hllyweird Critics Talk S**T again,Man these critics must be slickers for damn sure. The song pure and simple is the best song i've heard since Roll Gypsy Roll and let me tell you straight the Mama I'm afraid to say goodbye song will make you pull the ole air guitar out of the closet. A must have
1,Buyer Beware,"Warning! This review refers to the imported disc only. It is not a review of the music on this recording.I bought this CD when it was new and loved it. Unfortunately it was stolen and had be replaced.However, this disc is the second disc I have purchased from Amazon that was imported from England. Neither of these discs will play in my computer's disc drive. Do not purshase Cd's imported from England."
2,Very Stale,This reunited version of Lynyrd Skynyrd sounds too stale. Each song is delivered in the same angry tone and key. One guitar solo sounds like the rest. And the back up vocals by the new Honkettes are overutilized. Smokestack Lightning and Pure And Simple are two excellent songs. A few of the others aren't bad either. But its very annoying to listen to this CD in one sitting as it really all sounds the same halfway through the disc. Purchase Street Survivors or Second Helping for real classic Skynyrd.
1,"Buy ""Per-Nounced"" instead","This album is the same ""New Skynyrd"" that just doesnt sound good. Theres only two original members left to the band, the new Skynyrd is just a group of wanna be's that joined onto a really cool band that has a good reputation. Johnny Van Zandt is trying to act way to redneck in this album, and most of all, there is just nothing that stands out, it's all just the same old boring tunes. Buy a classic albums instead, like ""Per-Nounced"", ""Second Helping"", or ""Street Survivors"""
4,ROY C,The name Roy C says it all. Another disc from the master. This time with the hidden gem 'I Don't Want To Be Lonely'
1,Dont buy this online,"As with all products bought online, there is a chance that it does not fit. It was stated this is was standard size but it did not it my car steering wheel. It might of been a manufacturer defect, the product broke during installation."
5,Emotional perfection,"Cinjun Tate of Remy Zero is the newest addition to my list of all time favorite vocalists. His singing swoops and swirls and settles down into emotional crevices you didn't even know you had. He reminds me of The Bends-era Thom Yorke and Unforgettable Fire-era Bono. The musical arrangements are of course just as good and dramatic, but it's almost like Cinjun's voice is leading the music through the changes (even tho in the songwriting process of most bands the words and vocals usually come second). Check out the gut-wrenching vocals on songs like Perfect Memory, Save Me (the way he soars on these two is amazing and breathtaking), Belong, and Smile. Of course, every song is perfect but I just wanted to narrow it down instead of listing the whole album (which, believe me, is very tempting to do)."
5,The best modern rock band!,"This is the best example of well-written modern pop/rock I have ever heard. From the moment I slipped this disc into my CD player, I could tell that I had found something special. The title (The Golden Hum) perfectly sums up the feeling I came away with. This band is from Birmingham, AL, and it's quite refreshing to find a band with such well-conceived rock music, coming from the south. This album, produced by Jack Joseph Puig, is like the best of Smashing Pumpkins, Pink Floyd, Queen, and U2 all wrapped into one very original package. I have listened to this disc front to back hundreds of times and I never get tired of it!"
5,almost perfect,"the golden hum - what can i say? its almost the perfect album. The only negative criticism i can think of is that you have to wait too long to hear the hidden track. Every song on the album brilliant. Brilliantly written, sung and performed each track is the equal of all the others on the album. Although if i had to choose my favourites i'd say; Out/In, Over the rails and hollywood high and glorious #1. Id' almost say 'Grace' by Jeff buckley is the greatest album of all time, but because of the consistency of the golden hum i rate remy zero's effort higher."
4,4.5 stars out of 5,"i heard ""save me"" for the first time on the opening credits for the show ""smallville"" and was immediately hooked. found it again on a local radio station's website and got the cd the next night. i'm happy to say this was one of the best cd purchases of the year (along with the new weezer and go go's cd's). it's very much like radiohead's ""the bends"" cd, where it is great alternative rock mixed in with a pop flavor. great guitar hooks and smooth vocals from cinjin make this very easy to listen, while the deep lyrics force you to think. i highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves music and not the dribble of n sync and britney spears."
5,Golden Boys,"This is my first exposure to RZ, and I have to say they've knocked my socks off. This album is a tour-de-force of slightly theatrical, glammy, melodic rock, featuring soaring choruses, clever dual-guitar parts, and a big star sheen. I'm not going to stoop to comparing them to Radiohead or U2, but they do remind me somewhat of other melody-rock UK bands, like Marion and early Travis.There are so many great songs here, such as ""Over the Rails & Hollywood High"", ""Perfect Memory"", ""Glorious #1"", and ""Impossibility"". The album is pretty dense and requires a number of sessions for it to sink in, but it's certainly more than worth the time. Overall I think it's one of the best releases this year. And I still can't believe they're American!"
3,NOT like RADIOHEAD. Be advised.,"I enjoyed this cd, particularly 'Save Me' and the hidden track on #11 but overall, this cd wasn't what I expected at all. Most of this was due to false comparisons by some Amazon reviewers who said this band is like Radiohead and U2. U2, a little. Radiohead, not at all.Thom York's voice has been compared to EVERYONE and it's getting old. Coldplay, The Verve, and now this band. These bands are nothing alike.What I did notice was that Remy Zero struck a resemblence to The Verve. The lead singers are so similar it's almost frightening. If you enjoyed The Verve before they broke up, Remy Zero will suffice you with similar tunes. If you are an avid fan of Radiohead, however, this group is nothing like them."
3,Lite good - needs better hat,I got this lite for my husband and he likes the light however we have had to take this off of the hat and put the lite on another hat. The hat was too small so it would not keep the light in place
3,Good fun for kids,"My son received this for his birthday, and he loved it. It is lifelike enough to fool for a second, and that is really all you need if you place it in a good spot.As you might expect, this toy has lost part of its tail after being played with quite a bit.All in all, I am pretty happy with this item, but if you are looking for something really lifelike, I would keep looking."
3,"Anatomy not perfect, but the best I can find","I got the mouse not for pranks, but because I want a model mouse to help me design a setup for a research project. Considering the widespread use of mice as a model system in science, it's surprising that I couldn't find a good virtual or real mouse model. The rubber mouse is the best I can find. Anatomically, its proportion is more rat-like than mouse-like. But the overall size is close."
4,As a joke...,"I purchased this product because a friend of mine is deathly afraid of mice, so I wrapped it up and gave it to her!!! Let's just say she called me every name in the book!!! Hahaha. Well worth it! :) good quality and great price if you want to scare someone!"
2,Small,Small and looks fake. There was some rubber over the eyes I had to cut out. I bought it as a prank but couldnt use it. To fake for my liking.
5,FUNNY,"At school, I put the mouse in a girls locker and when she opened it, her face was priceless. She screamed and started to beat it with a water bottle only to find it was fake. But it was sooo funny to see her face get red and start to beat it. I got detention but it was worth it! This is a great prank and VERY FUNNY!"
1,a very big disapiontment,i order this mouse to scare my friends but when i saw it !!!!!!!big shock not even for baby;s @@@@ so don't even think about it
5,Fun,I took this on a cruise and we were planting it all over the ship waiting to get people's reactions. Once they saw it was fake they all chuckled. Had fun with it.
2,kid liked it I did not Fake looking,not many gonna fall this one...it is obviously not real..the synthetic rubber silicone is obvious but a little boy thought he could fool someone with it and he liked it because people pretended to be scared of the mouse. They were placating him they were not foolded.
3,Worked well and reasonable price!,Worked well and price was very reasonable! Good gag gift especially for someone who is scared of mice or having problems with mice
2,Only Semi Realistic looking,"Realistic? Not really. I did somehow manage to scare two coworkers, but they're the two who always scream when there's a mouse anyways. The coloring of the mouse is just a little too off. There's too much pink."
3,little rubber mouse,"The mouse was a little smaller than what we thought it would be, but still fun to have for pranks. Thanks!"
5,Great product,"I gotta say, as long as she keeps this thing on her side of the bed, it keeps her nice and toasty in the winter! Works great!"
4,Very Good Product,"Had very good results with the foot warmmer. Efficiently keeps the foot of the bed warm and works as exactly specified. Very happy with results and would recommend product to others. In fact, have all ready made recommendations to friends."
5,Getting better and better!,"I wrote a review for the first video in this set. I loved it, mostly because I was a beginner and they made it so easy to learn. My girl and I have been dancing together now for a while and we saw the second video and decided to try it. (on a side note, I would recommend the first video first. These moves are a little more intense and you need to be loose and comfortable first) I loved seeing these flashy, cool new moves! It's so much fun to use them when we go out, and now we're talking about entering some competitions! Basically, I feel like the man now.Definitely get into these videos if you're into country or dancing, or both!"
1,good for insomnia,The perfect cure for sleepless nights. Ten minutes of this jersey sharbage would put me to sleep. The only highlight in the occasional shot of j woww.
4,Cant wait for season 6!,"I pre-ordered this item, because I am a Jersey fan that has seasons 1-4 on dvd already, and since we've lost cable, I didn't get to see this when it aired. Once it was actually released and I waited for it to arrive, I decided to read the reviews, and after seeing the reviews about how the entire season was about if Snooki and Mike ""hooked up"" or not, I was kind of worried, but after watching I can say that the other reviews were wrong! Yes, the issue between Snooki and Mike is brought up quite often, there was A LOT more that happened in the season. I didn't feel it over took the other events at all. It did however show Mikes true colors. Don't want to be a spoiler, let's just say if you liked seasons 1-4 you'll probably enjoy this one as well, I say buy!"
1,jersey shore is the worst thing to hit tv in america,do not buy this dvd at all it is a waste of time and money buy something else instead this show is not even cool its boring lame and stupid and totally unintelligent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! do us all a favor and buy something else instead
1,Mindless,"I suppose people will still buy this: zombies and the brain dead. What a group of nobodies, heads filled with straw. Who thought this up? Worse, who writes for it? UhhGG."
5,Season 5,"Once again, the Shore kids deliver the good times, although this time there is a noticeable difference in the lack of all out drama. Definitely an excellent season."
4,A proof that some short movies can be good,"It's the first short movies compilation in a long time that I have really enjoyed.I find 5 films out of 7 interesting and well done. The two I am not so fond of is the third story and the follow-up animation.If I had to chose the best one, it would be the story about an older lady Irene and her gay friend Eric :) It is simple, but touching and including a lot of life wisdom. Below you can find my ratings for each of the films (5 is the max):1- 4 stars2- 4 stars3- 1 star (booring)4- 1 stars (way too long)5- 3 stars6- 5 stars7- 4 stars"
3,Maybe You Have to Be Welsh or British to Fully Appreciate It,"I ordered this CD after seeing a video of Bryn Terfel performing Tua Bethlehem Dref on a classical music cable channel. The carol, as he performed it, was stunning. On this CD, it's performed by a choir.Speaking as an American listener, I do not like spirituals or folk music when it's ""gussied-up"" and performed by very highly-trained choirs. The spoken-word segments of the CD also left me flat, as did other arcane carols that were rather lacrymose.I personally would not recommend this CD to anyone who was not Welsh or British (because I assume the disparity between my disappointment and others' raves may have to do with ethnicity)."
4,"NOT the ""Shopaholic"" series, but good book","I ordered this book used to complete my ""Shopaholic"" series, but didn't check the description or author. My mistake. But the book was very good. Just be sure you know it's not the series about Becky B!"
3,Seems undersized.,"While this hat definitely captures the look of Minerva's hat, it seems a trifle undersized for adult heads.I purchased this for my SO, who does not have a particularly odd-shaped or over-sized skull, and the hat is just a bit too small.In contrast, the Madame Hooch hat we purchased fits great, so I think that this one is not truly meant for adults.Well made, just not for most adults.Buyer beware!"
4,"Great quality, but not really adult size","I bought this hat to wear while handing out Halloween candy, but it didn't fit.It's made out of a wonderful thick material, and the shape is great.The size adjuster on the inside looks like something that would work very well for a child. It's a strip on the inner hat band, covered by a sleeve of soft material, that allows you to cinch the band tighter. There doesn't appear to be anything scratchy that might bother a child after adjusting the size.I would definitely recommend this hat to an older child or young teen, and to adults with small heads. (Honestly, I do not have a particularly large head, or any protuberances that would interfere with wearing a hat that's supposed to fit most adults.)"
1,waaay too small,"I ordered this for my 9 year-old son, despite reviews that said that the hat ran very small. I figured it wasn't likely to be a problem, since the description said it fits adults and kids 12 and up. But it doesn't fit even a teeny 9 year-old head. I would not recommend ordering unless it's for a very young child."
2,Not like the photo...,"The hat you get is not like the photo. They used a stock photo of the fancier (and now hard to find) quality McGonagall hats that came out when the first movies came out. I had seen one in person once and it was totally different. The hat is poor quality like it was meant for a child's Halloween costume, it doesn't fit an adult head, and is sewn funny so that the tip flops down and to the side in a weird way. It is deep black instead of dark grey like the original hat, and doesn't look like this photo at all. It is made of rather cheap-looking material and has that ""costumey"" look about it- not authentic looking at all. I feel like this was false advertising and I hope they will let me send it back...if not, Amazon will get an earful. I don't know if the more genuine, higher quality hats are still available anywhere...I think to get what you want, you must have to make your own. Bleh."
5,truly breathtaking,"We probably don't need MORE gushy praise heaped on this album, but i'm going to add mine anyway. Hands down winner of the Sweet Pop Magic trophy, the Killer Hooks medal, the Warm Humane Smart Cool It's OK to Feel Alive ribbon of honour. Also nominations for Best Lyrics (""i don't know about God, but i believe in you""), Best Cover, Best This, Best That. Their last one was good, but this is the cat's meow. Something to hold up against the madness of 9/11 (the same date this came out) and say ""yeah, but on some rare occasion, we can also make one of these""."
3,3 1/2 stars...more great pop textures,"Beulah is back with their flair for arrangement and exquisite pop textures. Like their previous ""Heartstrings,"" you can hear the nods to 60s and 90s alike; but this record also has flavors of 70s a.m. radio and I daresay a little Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. The vocals are stronger than their previous outing, but still a little wimpy/whitebread for my taste. The melodies are not quite as indelible as ""Heartstrings,"" and unlike many of the reviewers here, I find the lyrics predictable exercises in ""pretty music/bitter lyrics."" While the music is truly beautiful and well-executed throughout, I think these songs still lack heart, honesty and oomph. But they sound fantastic nonetheless."
5,too good to be true,"with winter fast approaching my little town of sioux falls, i needn't worry 'cause i got beulah to keep me warm til next spring. people, this record is perfect. there's not one bad song on this album. for those of you who are fans of ""when your your heartstrings break"", don't worry 'cause this record is sweeter yet darker, rockin' yet gentle, and eclectic yet straightforward. it has everything. now if they'd only tour south dakota my life would be complete."
4,David Lynch Presents the Beach Boys,"San Francisco's Beulah become the Beach Boys of the Elephant 6 collective on The Coast Is Never Clear. Endlessly inventive melodically, with a penchant for late 60's instrumentation (the bubblefuzz guitar riff echoed by short blasts of flute on ""A Good Man Is Easy to Kill"", for example), Beulah imbue their fractured tales of California sunshine with acidic undercurrents. On ""Gene Autry"", they describe urban sprawl as a ""city spread out like a cut vein"". The Grateful Dead mate with Robyn Hitchcock on ""I'll Be Your Lampshade"". Movie star vanity takes it on the chin in ""What Will You Do When Your Suntan Fades?"" With The Coast Is Never Clear, Beulah morph into the Beach Boys as re-imagined by David Lynch."
5,Best of 2001,"Believe the hype. This is one of 2001's best pop records. It has it all: good lyrics, tremendous hooks and variety galore. The songwriting is sharp, the song titles are witty, and the art is way cool. My vote for best record of the year."
2,Not the best...,"I hated having to use this text in my morphology class. It does cover all of the major issues and concepts, but does so in roundabout way. I often found the book confusing and had to reference online resources to make sense of it.If you are going to be teaching a course in morphology, please look for a book that is more student friendly."
2,"If you haven't seen the TV show, don't buy","The book is too tighted up with the TV show from BBC. So if you haven't seen the tv show, or don't know what I'm talking about, this book is a waste of time. It won't go deep dive into spy craft. There are other books that excel at that."
4,Spy: A Handbook,I haven't read it all - just dipped into it. Very interesting. I would have enjoyed more theory but that's just me...Helen
3,Not what I was hoping for.,"I ordered this book hoping to get insider information on the show and the contestants. I was disappointed when the turned out to be about 90% information about actual spies, their techniques and spycraft in general. The approximately 10% that refers to the show consists mainly of one chapter with a few paragraphs about each contestant and a couple of dozen pictures. The rest is short references to the show to illustrate various spy skills. It's still interesting, but it's not really about the BBC TV series ""SPY""."
3,"Zero star screenplay, five star production design","Let's start with the pro's: beautiful photography; brilliant casting (Irons was born to visualise H.H.); flawless set design. The con's: the overall ""mawkish"" (as the divine V.N. would probably put it himself) atmosphere; re-written dialogue, devoid completely of the wicked Nabokovian sense of humor that makes the novel such a joyful read (try the Kubrick version for that); exaggerated emphasis on Anabell Leigh; mediocre, pathetic (as in pathos) soundtrack. In short, don't let the movie spoil the book for you. There are some great cinematic moments, though: wet Lolita, lying on the lawn; Charlotte walking on the Hourglass lake bridge; piano keys stained with Quilty's blood, and especially the blood bubble (""with juvenile connotations"") on his lips' one of the novel's most striking images. Again, brilliant, beautiful, unforgettable photography."
3,This movie was not what I expected. Why was it rated R?,"This movie was o.k. I guess. What I didnt like was the fact that they killed off a character too soon and Lolita was not the sexy charming girl that the previews made her out to be, in the movie she was so immature ( chewing gum every 5 minutes, making immature jokes and eating candy like a pig.) Also I didnt understand why they made this movie rated R. Nothing ""adult"" went on between Lolita and Humbert.I gave this movie 3 stars because it could have been better and to me I didnt like the way that it ended."
2,Doesn't do justice to Nabokov's novel,"I must say, when I saw this film I felt like this did not do justice to Nabokov's Lolita. Most of the actors are not that great, with the exception of Jeremy Irons who makes a good Humbert. Our Lolita (Dominique Swain) is too old. When Humbert first meets Lolita in the novel she is 12 going on 13. Lolita realizes the power she has over Humbert and plays with him, so to say. I don't see that coming across here. In this movie, we know that Lolita and Humberts relationship is consentual, but most often, Swain makes Lolita seem like a whiney little brat. I did not like Melanie Griffath in the role of Charlotte Haze, the lonely widow desparate for Humberts affections. She doesn't come off with as much desparation and annoyance as she should. This film focusses too much on the sexual relations of Lo and Humbert. For example, when Mrs. Haze comes in after Lolita has skipped back to her room and asks Humbert, ""is she keeping you up?"""
4,"Still not sure what to make of it..eventually, i hope i will","My advice to anyone who's interested... see this version, see Kubrick's version, read Nabokov's book, read Nabokov's screenplay... then see what you think. This version has been accused of taking the tragedy of Lolita out of context from Nabokov's original intent of mocking such seriousness. In that respect, Kubrick's version is far better. Then again, his version is also guilty of torturing the audience with the ridiculous performances of James Mason and Peter Sellers. Lyne's version of Lolita, in terms of actors, succeeds far better than Kubrick's. In addition, the cinematography of the modern version is also admirable. Simply put, the movie LOOKS beautiful. A bit too long in some parts.. a bit too short in others... Adrian Lyne is an odd man. An odd director at that. Nonetheless, the movie is an interesting, and perhaps unique, addition to American Cinema. See the first recommendation. Then decide for yourself."
4,Unforgettable opening scene,"This 90s adaptation of Nabokov's masterpiece is filmed in a sumptuous visual style, with a lot of soft focus and golden hues. Said focus and hues are appropriate for a work that purports to be the rueful reminiscences of a half-mad professor composed in the confines of a prison cell. In this sense, Lyne's adaptation is true to the original, as I understand it anyway. The inevitable comparisons to Kubrick's version and to the original novel aside, this film is a success based on these two simple criteria: it is full of memorable images and it rewards repeated viewings. It's worth watching for the riveting opening scene alone, in which the camera tracks Humbert's slowly weaving car along an open (and, of course, highly picturesque) country road."
5,Beautiful,"I saw this movie when it premiered on the Sundance channel. I read the book first, I think that one of the reviewers would do well to read the book to answer his questions. The film is shot beautifully. I have been a big fan of Jeremy Irons for years, and now I can't imagine anyone else doing justice to the sentimental foreigner. Miss Swain was at one time innocent and at another all too knowing. This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen in my life! I recommend it to everyone."
5,A Moving and Touching Experience,"I thought that this was a beautifully made movie. The unusual subject was handled with with grace and class. I wanted to hate Humbert, but I found myself feeling sorry for him. Kudos to the director!"
2,"2.5 Stars, decent casting but bad directing.","I first read the novel several months ago based on the recommendation of my high school English teacher. I read the novel and loved it, then my dad recommended to watch Stanley Kubrick's adaption of it. I watched that and loved it. I was intrigued so i decided to check out the newer presentation of the film.In short, Jeremy Irons is an excellent actor and excelled at playing Humbert; however, his supporting cast and the film direction is nothing spectaculr. I did enjoy the cinematography and Iron's voice overs from his audio reading of Lolita. I certaintly do prefer the original movie which contained far more subtlety than this version, this isn't necessarily a bad movie, just an average film."
4,Very good and memorable film,"This is a noble stab at screen adaption. The Morricone score is nice, too. One thing I can't understand is why hasn't this version hasn't been released on Blu-ray?!?"
3,"I liked the film, but it is far from a masterpiece","I watched Lolita once and was impressed, but not absolutely taken by it. I expected much more from this film, its director and Jeremy Irons. Usually, a film such as this one leaves me with a desire to watch it over and over, to analyze it... But, I can honestly say that I do not have a slightest desire to see Lolita again (at least, not any time soon). The controversy around it went way out of proportion and may be done this film a disfavor, unlike to other films. Irons is so predictable and familiar that viewers, who know his previous roles, can practically guess his every gesture. On the bright side, however, the overall take on Nabokov's story is an interesting one. I enjoyed Mellany Griffith (her character playes a significant part in the story, albeit she is given very little film time). Also, Dominique Swan was so brilliant in her big on-screen debut that she made me forget the fact that she was too old for the role. She IS Lolita!"
4,Great re-telling.,"I feel as though a bit of the dark humor was lost in this re-telling of the book, but it's nevertheless a great watch. Dominique Swain, though young, is TOTALLY sexy! Jeremy Irons is morbidly lovable, and you can't even help but feel sympathetic.This is a movie that I genuniely enjoy."
5,Wow . . .,"After reading the book and seeing both versions of this film, I must say I was amazed. Adrian Lyne's version is much better than Kubrick's. There was narration from the book, including the vital first paragraph, and many events were true to the book as well. I thought Jeremy Irons portrayed a much better Humbert Humbert than James Mason. Come to think of it, I liked the entire cast better. I did not, however, like Frank Langella, although he was truer to the book's Quilty than Peter Sellers was. Everything is done very tastefully, considering what the story is all about, and is engrossing throughout."
4,Ya-ya...,"Ultimately, the great novel transcribed or adapted to the screen must fatefully fail. Unavoidably, the comparisons between the two Lolita films must come about. The original Lolita (1962) was directed by the late Stanley Kubrick and was adapted for the screen by Nabokov himself. To keep things short in this review...the modern Lolita lacks one thing that the earlier one had: a striking irony in the view and substance of the Lolita character. The original version depicts the nymph Lolita much more convincingly. Both films benefitted from a wonderful cast, although I believe that Melanie Griffifth's (sp?) casting was somewhat of miscast. Her performance was good, but I could never get the Shelley Winter's image out of my mind. Lastly...I felt something else missing from this version. What happenend to Lolita's Ya-Ya?"
5,A hot and erotic iron.,"Beautiful!!When I saw this movie,I was going to faint.It is a wonderful and succesful remake.I saw even the previous production of Lolita,in black n' white,but this is charming.Simply hits me at first sight.It might be that Lolita is jealous of her mother.Psychologically,Lolita wants to be her mother's copyright(miniature).The father isn't there to hold back the spoiled child.She is matured enough in 'erotic relationship',but still a child in the mind.Poor Professor Humbert,he can't be neither a father,nor a man.He should be a priest."
1,Lame Lolita.,"To associate this horrible movie with Nabokov is a shame. It has none of the wit and dark humor that made the Nabokov novel so great, and it has none of the charm and subtlety of Kubrick's movie. Bleak, bloodless, boring."
5,loved it,Great movie. great acting...Yes the content is taboo and yes it is a dark movie...but quite entertaining from our perspective!
4,Beautiful Production,"What a beautifully filmed movie -- camera, sound, costume, sets -- all perfect. However, I found myself wondering how Humbert could stand being with this obnoxious brat of a girl once the sexual curiosity was gone. Of course that's his problem, the sexual magic never ends for him. Is this love? Who knows?"
1,Horrible,"I watched the movie last night and was so surprised of the whole film. I thought it was stupid and twisted. I did know what it was about before watching it but when I actually saw the film and thought a 40 year old man with a 14 year old girl...that is just sick. I mean even the girl was acting like she was 10 years old and someone could find that sexy. The way the whole movie was displayed really disappointed me. I do give credit to Jeremy and Dominique on there acting because they both did a wonderfull job, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Lolita,This movie is mostly for men due to the grapic nature. The whole movie is conplexing and by the end you just find yourself angry that you wasted two hours.
4,the wonder of his love,"I am continually struck by the insight of Spurgeon's sermons. More than a hundred years later these sermons speak truth to the human condition and its relationship to the divine. These sermons, dealing with the love of Christ, issue a call for our response to that love. No one can express how deep or how wide Christ's love is, but Spurgeon goes a good way toward bringing certain aspects of it to light. I recommend this collection."
3,Everything was / is good no problems,"Everything was / is good no problems, Good photos of the Greatest City on Earth"
5,Elegant tea presentation,I just received this for Mother's Day and it's a very elegant way to offer tea choices to your guests! Completely lined in ivory soft felt and each space is divided by wood dividers. Very nice gift for the frequent hostess!
5,The box exceeded expectations!,"Besides the great taste of the product, the quality and appearance of the tea chest exceeded expectations. My wife was very pleased with the gift. We get a lot of compliments from our friends and family every time we take out our tea chest. We've refilled the box with other imported and domestic brands of tea and they fit perfectly in the box. Now, I would like to find a way to replace the fabric of the cover or change the logo without damaging the box..."
2,was dissapointed with the size,"This a nice tea chest, but for the price, I was really shocked by the size. It is not worth the $50 it cost. I wouldn't send this as a gift again, it's worth half the price!"
5,Wonderful tea set,The wooden box is wonderful and well made. The teas are excellent too. A great gift for any tea lover.
1,it's not same as photo don't buy it befor read my comment,"I bought this tea chest a few days ago , unfortunately it's Red and completely different color and it's not same as photo I hate Red color for this stuff and it's not beautiful color,worse thing is they said it's grocery and I can't return it . that's horrible it means I lose $50 it's not fair ."
5,A definite must-have,"Hitachi's Magic Wand massager is a great item to have around the house - it's a great massager, and a great vibrator. But, if you want to get full enjoyment out of the thing, then you MUST buy the attachments! The Wonder Wand has a straight projection that makes it wonderful for in-and-out penetration, which coupled with the Magic Wand's intense vibrations sends me straight to the stars. Also consider getting the G-Spotter whose curve provides some mind-blowing stimulation.Do yourself or your lover a favor, if you have the Magic Wand, and get the Wonder Wand to go along with it. It's a definite must-have!(Review of Wonderwand - Magic Wand Attachment)"
1,"Massive claims, no citations","While many of the claims of the book are revolutionary, the author gives almost no citations or references to research or corroborating evidence. A serious, serious oversight. With such grand claims, there must be evidentiary inclusions."
3,THIS BOOK PUTS YOU THERE,"I read this book in 1981 while recovering in a Naval Hospital, Okinawa, Japan. The writer is graphic in his description of the events which took place in Viet Nam.As I read, I could feel the emotions of the author. The fear, the intensity of the situation. He has enabled me to share the terror experienced by our service members in Viet Nam."
5,STRONG WOMAN IN VERY GOOD WESTERN NOVEL,"I stumbled on this book in my library while looking for another, and I am so glad I did. I am a huge fan of strong western tales, and if they have a strong woman character - even better! This is a gem and I plan on trying the other woman-centered novel this author has written CHARISSA OF THE OVERLAND."
3,"Serial gets 4 stars, transfer gets 1 star = 2 and a half stars","The serial is a better than average product of the great Republic Studios. Unfortunately, the transfer is pretty bad, with just barely acceptable image and sound quality. Perhaps, as another reviewer stated, there is no longer an original negative or interpositive for this serial, and what we're seeing is the best that could be obtained. Nevertheless, it's pretty hard to watch on a technical basis and for that reason, I recommend a rental rather than a purchase, unless the price comes down to $10 or less."
2,IMAGE QUALITY LESSENED THE ENJOYMENT,"ALTHOUGHT THIS SERIAL BOUGHT THOUGH AMAZON HAD LOTS OF ACTION AND MOVED FAST, THE LOW QUALITY OF THE IMAGES DETRACTED FROM THE ENJOYMENT. USUALLY, VCI PUTS OUT GOOD QUALITY DVDs, BUT APPARENTLY,IT WAS UNABLE TO FIND A GOOD MASTER COPY."
2,Not One of the Best,I enjoy watching serials from this era and I can definitely say that this one rates below average compared to others I have watched.
3,What is this: WS DUB SUB DOL CHK ?,"I have bought hundreds of DVD's and VHS tapes over the years. I have bought many new, and used ones from Amazon and its many fine Sellers. But even with all that experience, I cannot find out what, ""WS DUB SUB DOL CHK"" means. I tried googling it several different ways, but nothing really explained it.I'm guessing that ""WS"" means widescreen, and that ""DUB"" means duplication, or possibly, just ""dub"" (?). And ""DOL""? Does that mean ""Dolby""? And ""CHK""? I can't imagine. It would really help Sellers and prospective customers a lot if more definition and clarity could be used in product descriptions. Always telling whether it will play on USA-formatted Region 1 players should be obvious.As for the movie? Oh, yeah, I loved it. That's why I've been going through so much crap to be able to buy a decent, legal DVD of it without spending a jillion dollars.Thank you!"
3,Don't touch me,The movie starts right off with a flashback to earlier days when David R. Whitman (William Hurt) a bio-chemist accidently dispatches his family with a virus. Years later a guard to a chemical plant is dismissed and in an attempt to gain his job back he accidently causes a spill of the same virus.Now the chase is on to catch the contaminated man. In the process we have questions. Was the first incident and accident? And is this time really an accident?We watch the standard team of good guy hazmat team and bad guy NSA banterer as the contaminated man keeps getting away and causing havoc.So what is new about this film? NOTHINGSo is there any social redeeming value? NOIs the ending any message? NOSome people like to watch the same formula over again to see the nuances of actors or scenes.There ain't any nuances here.Still it could have been worse.
4,Straight information in a positive vibe,"Look at the cover of this book -- and while I know they tell you not to do this, you'll get a pretty good sense of what's inside. The people on the cover are not in their 40s, they're closer to 70 and they still project their joie de vivre and the ease and happiness of their physical intimacy. They obviously know how to enjoy life and each other. You look at the picture and you say, ""Hey, I want that."" For anybody over 50 who is frustrated by teaser magazine articles that promise to explain all and then fail to deliver any actual information, this book is a compact treasure trove of reassurance. As we extend our useful lives into 8 and 9 decades, surely it's time to demystify the secrets of keeping our sex organs as happily engaged as our hearts and minds."
2,Repetitive Questions!,"I purchased this game to play with friends and family so we could get to know each other better and learn new things about each other. There is a possibility that this game will never come out again because the questions are very repetitive. Some of the questions are corny and just plain stupid (ex. Would you rather be called a... a. freak b. nerd). Who cares!? There are multiple questions like these... you be the judge. The deeper questions are somewhat interesting, that is until you see multiples of similar questions with a couple of details changed. Maybe I just had higher expectations of this game based on research done prior to purchasing. I would not spend this amount on this game again (maybe I would pay $10?)."
5,Excellent CD!,"This is definately my favorite Gerald Levert CD so far. It is a perfect blend of old-fashioned soul (with great new production), and some more modern R&B, all very accessible. The vocals are excellent as usual, I think one of the best singers out there. On top of that, the songwriting on this album is top notch. Some songs that stand out immediately are Soul Mate, DJ Played Our Song, ..Good to You, Smile for Me, Can't Win, Got Love and Dream with No Love. These all represent a type of soul that is perfect for Mr. Levert's vocals, and are just great songs. Also the songs seem to have a little more universal appeal than usual (not just for ladies). Lately it is unusual for an album to hit with so many songs I like right off, so I'd have to say this album is great!"
3,Gerald's World Gerald Levert,"Gerald Levert is one of the great vocalists, male or female, of his generation. It is a shame that his voice is drowned out by the persistent, formulaic, and predictable boom and click (""noise"")of computerized keyboard and drum machine programming. The boom and click drones on for the length of the CD making it nearly impossible to discern when on song ends and another begins. One notable exception is the ballad ""Made to Love Ya"". Hopefully the record company will one day surround him with musicians that play real musical instruments and produce MUSIC worthy of his talents. The voice gets an A, the production and all else fails."
4,Asian Fear,"Asian movies are far more frightening to watch than the american version of their stories. This movie was predictable in many ways...a ghost with long black hair over her face, the deathly pale hand that grabs the victims shoulder, and young teenage girls dying. However, this story also had a plot that could fit any time period. After all, there is always the quiet nerdy girl who wants so badly to fit in and be like the leader of the pack that she will do almost anything...she might even die for it!"
1,total disaster,as the above guy says.. this one is heavy.. and it does need atleast three motors to run it.. it is so fragile.. and breaks very easily... the first time i flew it.. it nose dived and broke the front part...with a 10 ft fall... i was so dis appointed with this product.. and this seller cheated saying that this could fly.. as an engineer.. i strongly say that given the power of this motor.. it would definetly not fly.. no matter from where you fly it...
1,Complete disaster.,"This product is yet another rubbish product out of China. Cost is high and the quality of the product extremely low. Made of polystyrene that is flimsy, badly made and has little chance of flying 5 metres before plunging to the ground and disintegrating. It certainly does not do what it says on the box and indeed must contravene the Trade Discriptions Act. As well as the build the instructions are extremely poor. Having purchased it for my grandson to have it wrecked on its first flight left him very distressed.I would strongly advise that this product and any others of this type ""made in China"" should be avoided at all cost as you will just be thowing your money down the drain. Selling organisations should review the ethics of selling such complete rubbish."
1,Don't buy it,"It flew better than the other reviewers did, about 100 feet before it hit something because the tail controls didn't work well enough. After that it nose dove a couple of times before the nose cone broke. Pushing the battery back did help a bit but the tail servo needs a longer throw."
1,Not what i expected,"In the product description said It has metal frame, It didn't it's very light wight and the glasses are not good...I was very disappointed"
2,Nice look. Poor Quality.,"I liked the look of these sunglasses, but I dropped a pair and they exploded when they hit the ground."
2,Not What I'd Hoped For,"For the most part, what the author called villages I would call cities. Be that as it may, the pictures, also for the most part, failed to give the viewer a feeling for the location. It did include some pictures of views that, I assume, could be seen from the ""village""; but as to the places themselves, no warmth, no character, no sense of place. Just buildings."
3,"Mediocre work, but worth the cost if...","Similar products in the past have allowed for more customization, this seems a bit simplistic. If you dont want to invest a lot of time in creating a castle this is the right book for you. However, it has always been my feeling that if my character reached a high enough level to build himself a castle he will want to be picking out floral patterns for the drapes.It's still a good product, well written and creative, but in the end you will hunger for more content that just isnt there. Look for a similar product by Mongoose as thus far their Quintessential books have far exceeded the WotC books."
4,Decent sourcebook,"A little beat up, but still in good shape. This book is very helpful for those wanting to build or expand a stronghold or keep."
3,Missing the most important part - combat rules,"Wizards dropped the ball on this one. This book would have been a perfect place to introduce mass combat rules - instead the book basically tells the DM to just decide on the outcome of battles and role-play the PC combat portions. Weak.The rest of the book is fairly well-done, although it does gloss over the fortress-building process. I'd recommend ""Castle"" by David Macaulay for a graphic presentation of the actual construction."
4,Excellent historical novel,This 3rd book in a trilogy is excellent. True-to-history details make it so good.
3,Just OK,"I prefer the metal slinky, but this one was fine. You have to be gentle in handling it so it doesn't break. Good toy for kids."
2,false description,"The description of this product is incorrect. It states the slinky is 3.9 X 3-8 inches, when in fact it is 3 1/16 X 2 3/8 inches. The model number (110) is the same as one I purchased about 5 years ago, but the one I already have is 4 inches by 4 inches. I wanted the larger size, as that is what my grandson requested. It was very disappointing to receive something that was not as described on the website.Unhappy in Maryland"
3,"100% Satisfied. It's a Slinky, afterall.","Transaction, delivery, and product all as expected. 100% Satisfied. Purchased this for my 3-year old based upon my own fond memories of Slinky, but went with plastic because I remember the metal ones could be a tad sharp. I consider Slinky more of a novelty ""fun"" toy, and in its brief life this one performed as expected before the tangles and bends accumulated beyond the point of reasonable repair. An older child may not destroy it, but I'm hard pressed to imagine him/her having as much fun with it as my three year old did."
4,"Plastic slinky, just what we expected","I had hoped for a color other than lime green--but my daughter doesn't seem to care one way or another! She bent my old metal slinky out of shape, so I got this for her instead."
3,"What can you say, it's plastic...","""What walks down stairs? Alone or in pairs? And makes a slinkedy sound?""Not this slinky. BUT, I didn't buy it for those things anyway. I purchasd this item so my Elf on the Shelf could ""bungee"" jump from a super high niche' in my home. It served its purpose, so I'm not complaining. If you want the aforementioned signature slinky attributes, buy a metal slinky. Just my thought on it."
4,good choice for a toddler,"My toddler son plays with this a lot more than most of the toys he got for Christmas. After two weeks he broke it in half. Well, what do you expect from a plastic slinky! He was still happy because now he has two slinkies."
5,ROB IS THE BEST CHICANO RAPPER,"this is the best album i heard since ""CRAZY LIFE""(also from lil rob).nobody does it better than lil rob. the best songs in this album are, the outcome, natural high, and wickie wicked."
2,A one-sided pressing,"The picture appears to show a true 3-dimensional charm. If you flip it over you find that it is a ""pressing"" or hollowed out charm that only looks like a pelican on one side. That means that if it flips over while you are wearing it you are looking at scooped out silver and not a pelican. On the plus side it does come with a very fine chain that looks about 18 inches long."
5,Unifix: Educational and Fun,"I bought these Unifix cubes to use as a math manipulative for my 4-yr. old homeschooler. Little did I know that she would build structures when not in use for teaching! She truly enjoys making creations and at the same time the cubes are a great teaching tool for math. Though the cubes came with a guide (very thin/not lengthy)I ordered the paperback, Developing Mathematics with Unifix, by Paul Swan, as an extra guide. Kaplan sent the cubes in time and the product arrived in good condition."
5,Amazing Math Resource,"We use Unifix Cubes for everything math-related: counting, patterns, addition and subtraction facts, place value, counting by 2, 5, 10. We even used them to learn colors. They are also a great way to visualize decades and a century. They could work for graphing, etc.I am sure as more math and other topics come up, we'll find more uses for them. We had these cubes since the beginning of the year and so far they are very durable. A truly great find!There is a little booklet that comes with the cubes that shows different ways to use them. Definitely money well spent."
2,Not well made,"I bought for my 2.5 year old for Christmas. She loved it in the beginning but the cubics do not stay together the way it supposed to be, so she stopped playing. Now, it is in the garbage pile."
5,great math tool/toy,"my girls were so happy to get these. the kindergartener knew exactly what they were from using them in school. they jumped right in and started counting, adding, and building with them."
5,Perfect!,"Cubes are distinctly colored and well-made. I considered just using beans or some other cheaper kind of counting manipulative for my 1st grader, but I'm so glad I spent the cash on these. My kids all enjoy playing with them. The insert is helpful but didn't stand up well to multiple uses."
5,Un Aller Simple by Didier van Cauwelaert,The book arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner. I would definitely order from this bookseller again.
2,Inconsistent measurements,"I bought this scale at Target a few weeks ago, and returned it in 3 days. It may be that I had a dud, but here were the problems:1.) Inconsistent weight and bodyfat: My husband and I each tested the scale and within a 3 minute range got at least 2 (me 3) wildly different body weight and fat measurements. Mine was a range from 123-130+ lbs.2.) Poorly wired: the start button only worked if you wiggled it, and it kept getting stuck.3.) Batteries NOT included (9v)So for almost $40 bucks, the scale seemed pretty crappy in all important aspects. Pity, because the brand seemed kind of established. Perhaps it was just a dud, though..."
5,great- as marketed and 2 years later still tickin,"writing this review 2 years later. excellent product. has mounting holes that I was able to use to mount in my trunk. near the amp. Offered a good clean install. Trunk looks beautiful, professionallly done yet again. would highly recommend. 2nd time using soundgate products. pleased yet again"
1,"If you hated Galileo, you'll love this book",Glad that Galileo was persecuted for discovering truth about our planet? Well then you will love Judith Reisman's absurd distortion of Kinsey.Fundamentalists who can not stand the way scientific facts conflict with their myths and blissful ignorance will stop at nothing to discredit anyone who attempts to bring truths to light. Reisman must be a hero to those fundamentalists. But you will never find anyone who takes science seriously reading this book or giving it any credibility.
3,Beware: assembly issues,"This product did not come with assembly instructions. We figured it out, but not w/out some trial and error. The table is ok for the price, but the chairs suck. We have had to screw, nail and reassemble these chairs many times. The chair parts are lopsided so they rock when you sit on them. After rocking for awhile they start to come apart. I think we have had this set for almost a year and we reassembled the chairs again last week.For a person who is handy with a wood shop this is a great deal, but for the rest of us with a small tool box for minor household repairs; you get what you pay for..."
2,There are better books than this one,I have bought several watercolor books and this one is my least favorite and was more expensive than all the others
3,its okay,"bought this with the floor mats, they look okay, smooth all around except for the 4 grip points, but instead of bumps they are ""sharp"" in my opinion, been driving with this for 1 year and i still feel it scratches my palms a bit too much for comfort.Update: 9/13/2011It is now cracking and peeling, time for a new one. I guess life span was about 1 yr 9 months. I am happy to be getting a new one."
5,Good fit..comfortable,"As reported by others it is a tight fit getting it on the wheel. I didnt have to do anything extra like warming it up, just worked it on with a little patience. I like the feel of it especially the rough area where you hands usually sit. It provides a feeling of confidence that you have a good grip. The black/grey color complements the interior of my black/grey colors. You will be pleased with it."
4,"Sweet, but weak ending.","I really enjoyed this because of the two cute leads, the scenes near my home near Palm Springs, and the gay theme. The story line could easily happen because of Dylan's age (and his naivete). But the ending was terrible.Okay, it didn't need to be a Hollywood ending where everyone lives happily ever after, but that last scene just left me hanging. I wanted closure. I didn't get it. Okay, when Dylan is smiling in the rear view mirror as he's coming back to LA might have been it, but I had to guess that's what this movies' closure looked like. Did I really have to guess?Regardless, I gave it 4 stars because it was particularly moving in a few of the touching scenes. The acting by Chad and Jeff was very well done. Bravo guys, I was able to watch it to the very end and not cringe at 'bad acting' or horrible dialog."
2,"Realistic, but weak.","The idea is interesting as it is very close to one's experience (who tends to fall in love easily), however, its development and poor acting jeopardize the movie. It seems to be a low-budget movie too. So, rent it if you want. As for me, I regretted buying it."
3,Phoenix,I thought the movie was pretty good. I thought that Chad Bartley was worth watchingI am not sure they needed him without his clothes on so much. But that is one ofthe hightlights of the movie.
1,Awful,"Michael D. Akers made a memorable, insightful, and ""fun"" movie withGone, But Not Forgotten. See it, and avoid ""Phoenix.""Phoenix is a movie in search of meaning and in search of a story. In a nutshell, a young (and very cute) man discovers that his lover is leading a double life and has a husband in Phoenix. After the despicable and poorly-acted lover then disappears, he gets to know ""the other man"" and starts to fall for him. Big deal. Most of this movie is him wandering around and/or walking around the house/apartment/hotel in various states of undress. (These moments are actually some of the highlights.)I'd completely avoid this movie. It's a wasted effort for Mr. Akers. I would have thought he could do better than this, certainly."
3,Not a bad little picture,"This is actually a well-done picture, considering it was filmed on a tight budget. I watched Michael Akers' first film, ""Gone, But Not Forgotten."" That film was OK, but the production quality was so poor that the story got lost in the ""cheapie"" look, sound, lighting, and overall feel. ""Phoenix"" has a pleasing look, excellent sound quality, and good background music that actually blends into the film without being invasive. The acting is acceptable, especially by new-comer, Chad Bartley, who shows a surprising range of emotion. This film does not have the cinematic quality ""Get Real"" or ""Latter Days"" has, yet the film is enjoyable and certainly worth watching more than once. Michael Akers is learning his craft and getting better at film making."
2,Save your money...,"The only thing worth watching or listening to in this entire movie was Jeff Castle. After seeing ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"" several times and liking it, I expected more from Michael Akers than this piece of fluff. The use of too similar a tone and almost identical background music (certainly from the same group) indicates Akers' range as a filmmaker is rather limited. If not for Jeff Castle, I would have trashed this movie toward the beginning... instead of at the end."
4,Pretty good but version description misleading.,My kids enjoyed watching this English version (very entertaining) but they were a bit disappointed that the storyline did not go so far as described on the cover --- Monkey does not yet meet Pigsy & Sandy and only just met Tripitaka when the movie ends.
3,A Long Way From Sun Wa Kung,"This cartoon version is a long way fromt the classic Chinese legend, It does, however, provide an interesting view of how modern animation deals with ancient legend. As a teacher using this for a course, I was pleased. As a lover of ancient Chinese literature, I was pained."
3,I can relate,"If you have ever lived next to the neighbors from hell, you would probably enjoy this movie. I disagree with some of the negative reviews this movie has received. No, it wasn't oscar material, but neither was it as bad as most other movies I have seen recently in the theaters.I really think that the people who would most get this movie are the people who have had these kinds of neighbors. I actually watched the film late at night because my neighbors were keeping me awake, ironically enough. They do go a little far, but they really just take the thoughts of any frustrated, sleep-deprived, angry person to an extreme. I guess I found it funny to watch their misery because it made mine seem not so bad after all."
4,Very Funny!,"A young couple, Stiller & Barrymore, looking for a home with a somewhat limited budget, come upon the perfect affordable duplex home in Brooklyn, N.Y. The home comes with a sweet little old lady who rents the upstairs portion. Stiller's part of the home is the downstairs portion, and it is gorgeous with the beautiful wood interior, built in bookcases, fireplace, and stained glass windows. Perfect, right? W-e-l-l, not exactly.As you will quickly see, the little old lady turns out to be a royal pain. She causes trouble one way or another and is slowly ruining their lives. Meanwhile Stiller (the author) is trying despirately to meet his publisher's deadlines in a seemingly no-win situation. They are stuck with the granny from Hades until she voluntarily moves, or dies.Quite funny and very entertaining as you try to figure out what is going to happen next!"
4,Great Drew and Ben movie!,"Drew Barrymore and Ben Stiller do great in this movie by being a couple who find a house they love, but upstairs there is a old annoying lady. When they buy the house they really get to meet the old lady and they want to have a family, but they would the upstairs so they try to get her to move, but she refuses to. It`s also hard for them to put up with her and she makes them do stuff and if they didn`t she would say something and they would feel bad about it and help her. Everything would happen at the wrong time when they were by her and they try to kill her, but it`s impossible. That`s all I got to because it was late when I saw it and I was too frightened. I enjoyed it, but not everyone will."
3,The actors make it work,"Danny Devito seems to be stuck on the idea of making dark comedies of late. He's better at it than he gets credit for. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore star as a couple who move to a Duplex that they love. There's just one problem, the old lady upstairs. She bugs them to do choirs for her, blasts her tv when they are trying to sleep. Just for those reasons the couple decide to kill her a little too quickly. There's a lot of scenes where they try and fail but I found them all pretty funny and one even extremely gross. Eileen Essell shines as the little old lady who drives the couple crazy. I think Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore shine as well and have better chemestry than they got credit for. The movie is basically the Money Trap meets Throw Momma from the Train. I think the actors make it work though because they work great together. Plus unlike the couple, you sorta love the old lady and not hate her. She totally steals the show."
4,"Decent little film, desparation goes a long way","Sure, this movie streaches the imagination a bit, but it's a comedy that is actually pretty funny. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore play a couple who are trying to start a family and need to move into a bigger apartment to do so. They find a duplex that is ""too good to be true"". And that rings true. Little did they know their sweat quiet old lady upstairs isn't so quiet. A landlords nightmare, this duplex is more than what they bargined for. Danny Divito did a pretty good job with this flick, worth a rental."
4,Another Funny movie with Drew and Ben,"Drew Barrymore and Ben Stiller make this a funny movie by being a couple who buy a house they love and upstairs there is an annoying old lady who makes them do stuff and if they say no she says something that makes them want to help her. Then they get so annoyed they try to kill her. Also, Drew and Ben also want the upstairs because they want to have a family. I couldn't see the ret of this because when I saw this it was late and I was frightened of what would happen next. Anyway it's a funny cute movie and it couldn't be better without Drew and Ben."
3,PRETTY FUNNY!,"I'm not a Ben Stiller fan, but I caught this flickon cable, and it was actually pretty good. The oldlady makes this movie work too. Worth a rent."
1,Not worth your money or time.,"This movie is just awful. A few funny moments, but nowhere near Drew Barrymore's typical caliber. Please don't bother."
2,Are you a Ben Stiller fan?,"Well so am I. I've always found his movies to be absolutely hilarious and when I saw the preview for 'Duplex', I was excited to see it. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as good as any of his movies. While the plot was decent, the movie seemed like it rushed through events kind of fast, the script wasn't exactly amazing, and as a whole, the movie just wasn't all that funny... Hopefully, 'Along Came Polly' will be better...."
3,Does Not Deliever,"For a movie having two superstars such as Berrymore and Stiller, this movie just doesn't get it done. The plot is a little more involved then what I expected, but the dialouge, follow, even the acting was marginal at best. I just can't recommend this movie. If you reall want to see it I say rent it. This is not worth owning."
1,"Annoying movie plot, DO NOT watch it","This movie is an exact copy of Tom and Jerry. Jerry always won and Tom is actually the victim. Seriously, this kind of plot is dumb and lame, if I want to make someone misery I can do it in a blink of eye, not to mention the opponent is an ancient ugly woman. I knew something is going on with the agent, cop and the ugly old one, it was too obvious.But this movie does give us one helpful advise, DO NOT trust any old ancient human, they are not what they seem, DO NOT give them respect unless you really know who they really are. Appearance can be deceiving."
1,I was waiting for the old lady upstairs to pull off her mask,"As far as enjoyable movies go, this was not one of them. There are some people who enjoy dark humor. This movie definitely crosses the bridge into ""just an awful plot to begin with"".Towards the middle of the movie, as the plots to remove the old lady upstairs continue, my girlfriend told me that it would still be ""allright"" to watch if the ending was satisfactory. After a few more attempts to remove the old lady, she revised her opinion to ""no good ending could ever save this movie.""If you are looking for a mix between Scooby Doo and Home Alone 2, with some awful writing, you have found it."
3,hehehe.....That whacky Stiller Guy!!!,"not a classic by any means but well worth it if you'd like to laugh for a couple of hours. If you really like it, you can give a friend your Widescreen or Full screen disc. (whichever you'd prefer) It comes with one of each. Cool Idea!"
3,Entertaining,The movie is funny with a sick and morbid sense of humor. I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it as a rental.
3,"It's okay, some funny moments, but not great","I've become a Ben Stiller fan after seeing him in There's Something about Mary. He is funny, and I like Drew Berrymore. I thought this movie would be a lot funnier. The movie is about a husband and wife looking for their home and inheriting a neighbor that is a pain!!! She is an elderly lady who has to count everything, and has a little mean streak. The couple try to devise ways of getting her to move out and all their plans backfire. I'm not one for movie extras so I could really care less about that, but the movie was okay."
3,Save this one for a rainy day..,"From out of nowhere comes ""Duplex"" a somewhat funny comedy directed by Danny DeVito, it stars Ben Siller and Drew Barrymore. This movie must of had a short life in theaters, because I never even knew of it to be on the big screen. Perhaps I blink'd and missed it. Anyway, I said it was somewhat funny a moment ago, let me explain. It was funny, but only a few scenes were laugh out loud funny. The movie as a whole was more of a crack a smile comedy with an edge. A dark (""wanna murder your sweet faced yet annoying Irish old lady neighbor"") kinda comedy with a dash of uninvited satire. If you're fans of Stiller or Barrymore the movie will most likely be more enjoyable than if you're not. I liked both stars and was on their side the whole time. I'm not going to go over the storyline for you, there are a number of other reviews that do that. I will recommend ""Duplex"" for a rainy afternoon movie."
2,Disappointing,"As a big fan of Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore and the kinds of films they have worked on previously I was quite disappointed. It was quite weak in plot and although it had a few laughs, the the old lady is scary as anything at the end so watch out. Don't go out of your way to buy this one but it might be worth a quick look if you want a few laughs from a predictable comedy."
2,So - So Dark Comedy 2.5,This Movie Was Supposed To Be Funny. While It Had It's Moments It Was Bassically A Bland AS Hell Movie.
2,"Watch ""Throw Momma from the Train"" instead","The only redeeming quality to this movie (aside from the ending) was the fact that it reminded me I hadn't seen ""Throw Momma from the Train"" in a while. Stiller and Barrymore sleepwalk through this film and you will too."
1,Pass on this one,There are some moments that are mildly amusing but the movie overall is a complete waste of time and is now languishing on the floor next to my library while I decide on the best way to get rid of it. I had thought that perhaps Drew Barrymore could lift the story above Ben Stiller's patent incompetence but instead she chose to join him in it.There are comments on the DVD box that indicate 'intelligent comedy' is inside. That comment is as stunningly inept as Ben Stiller's acting.
1,Echo Bridge ha eliminado los Subtitulos en Espanol,"Quiero manifestar mi descontento por los titulos de MIRAMAX que esta lanzando ECHO BRIDGE HOME ENT. debido a que ha eliminado los subtitulos en Espanol de varios titulos Miramax que si los tenia anteriormente como DUPLEX, DOWN TO YOU, WISHFUL THINKING, CURSED y lo mas probable es que haga lo mismo con BECOMING JANE. Me parece un punto negativo, un punto en contra para los coleccionistas de DVD que ocurra este tipo de cosas, que se eliminen los subtitulos en Espanol."
2,not tairabley bad,duplex was a romantic comedy with ben stiller and drew barrymorewhen they think they have a perfect house they find out that a little old lady lives upstars.this littel lady turns out to be evil and tries to kill them. this movie was ok but i thought it would be vary funny.but it turned out to be not that funny.but it was still a preaty good movie.you should defintly rent this before you buy it.
2,Lame,Not as cool as the hype. There is a reason this went quickly to video without much hype. I like Devito and Stiller but this just was not that great of a comedy it was simply average and I expected more given all the prais reviewers have given it.
4,THE CLAPPER,"Yes, I had never heard of this movie until my girlfriend rented it one night. I loved Zoolander so I wasn't that surprised to like this. Anywho..the whole ""Clapper"" scene was so stupid I almost puked I was laughing so hard.Honestly we kept backing up the movie just for that scene. Just watching Ben Stillers face contort in agony was great. Great Friday night movie worth watching again!"
4,Good movie!,Classic Stiller! One of my favs! Would recommended to a Ben Stiller fan! Drew Barrymore is awesome too! Two thumbs up!
2,They've been better,I'll keep this short. I expected a lot more from this duo. I was left feeling disappointed after seeing this movie. I wouldn't watch it again.
4,Neigbor From Hades....,"Alex and Nancy's dream house becomes hell on earth, when their upstairs neighbor torments them with endless small requests and complaints. While normally I do not like this type of movie, I found Duplex to be an amusing film. I won't spoil it, but if you like dark humor, you'll like this one. The ending was the best part of this film. Four Stars."
3,Funny Danny Devito film,"Now all we know need is $25,000 to get rid of an old lady. lol""Duplex"" was a very funny and entertaining film by Director Danny Devito. Devito's resume of films does read like a long list of mean spirited revenge films. ""War of the Roses"", is the one that sort of came to mind first, although in this case we have one couple (Stiller and Barrymore) working together to get rid of one nasty old lady. Critics panned the film calling it unreal and stupid, but that's the appeal. Its sort of like a twisted version of ""Home Alone"" except we have an old lady using various dirty tricks to get rid of her two attackers.There are many gags some of which are funny and original. The hiring of a hit man near the end was probably too much but this produced giant laughs as did the surprise ending. I bet not too many movie critics saw that ending. A very funny film."
3,Funny movie!,"This is just a funny, glad you don't live in that house kind of movie! It's not going to win any awards but it will make you laugh."
4,The best of a bad lot,"This dictionary is the best of a bad lot of english-hebrew/hebrew-english dictionaries. It is more current than many other dictionaries. Although the Internet age hasn't penetrated this dictionary. The same thing goes for the other 6 dictionaries have used. This dictionary includes more slang than any other that I have used. This is a good thing. In everyday communication you encounter so many words that are not taught in ulpan. Of course, slang changes a lot, so you can't expect a dictionary to be complete, however, at least there is more slang and idiomatic usage in this dictionary.The failing that this dictionary has, is that it does not include the plural forms of words when they are irregular. This is a real problem. Other dictionaries, like the NTC dictionary do a better job of that."
4,A little slow,"It is a little slow, but wanted to read before watching the movie. A lot of history of Texas and that area, but interesting."
3,True Women Audio Tapes,This audio tape version makes such large leaps in the plot line that it is difficult to follow.
2,Slower than previous version,"My company recently upgraded to Acrobat 8 from Acrobat 6. Maybe there are some new tools that I don't need to use yet. But in general, I'm unhappy with this upgrade. The OCR takes longer. When extracting pages, I get a strange ""in use"" error seemingly randomly. Then half the pages disappear into the ether and half stay on the PDF I'm extracting from. The new PDF is not created. Be very careful to check before you save anything you do! Guess I'll just have to slow down and be less efficient thanks to this ""upgrade."""
2,It was a lemon,"I recieved this product and loaded it onto my computer. The first thing I tried was to create a PDF file from the scanner. The program immediately shut down and gave me an error message indicating I should try a later version of Adobe Reader. further attempts also failed. Removed the program from the computer and reloaded it with the anti virus disabled. Got the same results. That wasn't the only thing. My attempts to build a PDF document,i.e. inserting a pdf file, also shut the program down telling me to get a later version of reader. After many attempts to resolve these problem, I requested a return. I am waiting for a response.I think I got a lemon. I used Adobe Acrobat 5 and have used Adobe Acrobat 8 Professtional at work and havn't had a problem. Once I get the return straighten away I would probably try Adobe Acrobat 8 Standard again."
1,It S.T.I.N.K.S !!,IT is not very good value at all. IT broke in two days. I would suggest a different brand. IT S.T.I.N.K.S. !
3,Left me wanting more.,"I loved Rich on Ozone radio on the old Ozone Radio show on public access and they did bring back some of his best acts but I feel I would have been much happier if they had released a collection of all the episodes of ozone radio, though this DVD is reassuring that all those tapes haven't been lots forever."
3,messy marv bootleg,"this cd isn't stuff polished up by messcaleen himself- it has been bootlegged. the verses still flow- messy marv is smooth but vicious, without sounding too cheesy like a lot of rappers that stress gangsta stuff constantly. compare mess's lyrical style to snoop dogg, with mess being a wilder version, with snoop laid back in the cut with an L.................."
3,I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse !,"This is a little book of only 104 pages.While there is nothing new or surprising ;it is a good little easy reading time filler.Gangster books,be they true or fictional,movies,TV shows,etc.are full of these kinds of picturesque verbage.There is no mincing of words in these circles.It would be easy to fill volumes with this talk;however not knowtng the source would detract.At least the author sets the scene of each quote.However; the quote I have used in my title has been used often.Not a bad little read;but no surprises.Another case of a mediocre grant supported book."
4,Breath of fresh air!!!,"I was eagerly awaiting this album, and it does not let me down. In a day where the pop/rock genre is washed out and each band is indistinguishable from the next, Steadman comes in to give music fans a breath of fresh air. Their musicianship, melodies, lyrics, and Simon's vocals are all superb. I won't mention the Beatles, Crowded House, Oasis, and early Radiohead comparisons, because those have been mentioned everywhere, but it's worth pointing out that this is an original band with a new and different twist on those familiar sounds. Also worth mentioning is that Revive is an ALBUM instead of a collection of singles and filler which has somehow become the norm for 95% of pop/rock albums these days. I highly suggest checking this album out. This band is moving up, and are on the verge of national attention. Get this album now and be ahead of the game."
2,Didn't get a slinky,"I actually thought I was getting a slinky....the old fashioned metal kind. I buy them every year and we enjoy a Christmas day slinky race down the stairs. I actually got the slinky dog from Toy Story instead. I'm not sure if I ordered wrong or it was sent wrong but I was disappointed. I didn't have time before Christmas to look into it so I wrapped it and gave it to my daughter anyhow. She was excited that it was a ""Toy Story"" toy as she loves the movie but it really hasn't been played with once and no slinky races this year. :("
5,Can you ever go wrong with a slinky? Really.,"Can you ever go wrong with a slinky? Really. Of course, my 8 year old loves this little stocking stuffer. If you have stairs anywhere i or around the house, you can never go wrong with a slinky."
5,MK Michigan,"Every one needs a Original Slinky! It was fun back when I was a kid and is still fun now. My kids love them and there are new tricks on You Tube, you need to check it out! Buy at least two of these one to keep and one to give as a gift!!"
2,Too expensive since it will break within hours,Kids love the Slinky - no doubt - but it will break/tangle within a few hours of play. Every time. $[...] to a six year old is more than a week's allowance at my house. Too much...
2,Wish I could get Free Super Saver Shipping on a plastic Slinky Jr.,"I have a dwarf rabbit who loved his old plastic Slinky Jr. He does not like the metal one, and I am hesitant to let him play with metal toys to begin with, but for some odd reason, Amazon would not give me free shipping on a plastic Slinky Jr., so I decided this would have to do. Regular sized Slinkys are too big and heavy for him. :("
2,Waste of money in my opinion.,My son had a plastic slinky before this one. It didn't last very long. I got the metal one thinking that it would. I was mistaken. In a matter of weeks he had managed to get this so tangled up that we had to bin it. It was impossible to get it untangled. The toy has no apparent educational value and the novelty of watching it 'walk' wears off after a few times. I would not purchase another slinky no matter how he bargains!
1,Stairs,I was so excited to get this for my kids but when it arrived excitement was short-lived. I don't have large or long stairs nothing a slinky in my day would have had a problem with. This slinky was not up for the task. Two steps and done. Just some more junk I have to throw away.
4,Slinky,I had one of these as a kid and loved it. My sister has bought one of these for my sons stocking filler and I know that he is going to have a lot of fun with it. Happy to recommend it.
2,I don't like it,Diameter of coil is considerably smaller than the original Slinky. It didnt have as many coils on it as the original. It will not walk down stairs as advertised. It was cheaply made. I will never reccoment this product to a friend (or an enemy)
3,I love the product! But be warned.,"I love this slinky! Really cool and well made. Now the price was dirt cheap but if you need this slinky in the next 3 weeks, don't count on it. I ordered this slinky in early November and I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally I got tired and messaged the seller and a couple days latter I got a reply saying they'd ship it. It finally camein the mail early December. I came in a very beat up box with not much padding. So the seller, stinks. The product itself is ok."
1,Original Slinky ?,"Very very disappointed. I bought this toy for my granddaughter's birthday thinking that she would get a kick out of seeing the slinky go down the stairs and it did not happen. What a dud. The slinky was not flexible. It was stiff, looks like it was cut in half and the color was a very dark metal color, was not at all like the slinky I remembered. The add was very misleading. To return the slinky for a refund will cost me more than what paid for it. Very disappointed."
2,Diameter too small to be useful,"I purchased this slinky for my grandaughter, hoping it would be a close replica of the slinkies that I experienced in the 1960's. Those slinkies were about 5 inches in diameter which gave them the capability to ""walk"" down stairs and other larger objects. This slinky has a much smaller diameter which limits how much that can be done with it. Advertising it as the ""original"" slinky is misleading in my opinion."
1,mislead,"When I think of an original slinky, I think of the one that was not the small one. This was so small that my grandchildren would never be able to use it. Plus, it would not go down the stairs as the ""original"" one did. I did not send it back because it would have cost more in return postage than the slinky cost. Make sure if you want the original one, you do not get the Jr. one as it is useless. It is going to be used as a white elephant gift at our annual family Christmas gathering."
1,not your mother's slinky,i remember when i young what fun it was to have the slinky walk down the steps. i'm really not sure what else a slinky does. well the slinkies i bought my kids do not go down the steps. I'm guessing they are not as long as they used to be so stair-walking is no longer possible. very disappointing.
2,Why won't it walk down the stairs?,"I had a Slinky when I was a kid many decades ago, and had lots of fun with it. So I ran across this Original Slinky on Amazon and decided to order one for my grandson who seems to like simple toys over the modern fancy electronic toys and gadgets. So the Slinky arrives and I open it and immediately notice it seems smaller than the one I had when I was 10.Then I try to walk it down the stairs. But it won't go down! No matter what I do, it just makes it down measly one step before it stops dead. What's wrong? Am I Slinky-challenged? I notice the Slinky's spring-iness just doesn't feel right (feels tighter than I remember). I'm guessing the amount of spring has to be just right for it to work properly. So maybe I got a cheap knock-off?I wish I knew what happened to my old Slinky - that one was perfect!"
2,Not my Slinky....,This slinky is lots smaller that what we remember from having these as a kid.It will NOT go/walk down our stairs as the larger one would.I waster my $$ on this item !!
2,smaller than expected,"When it said ""original slinky"", I assumed it would be full sized, but it wasn't. It was too small to ""walk"" down the stairs. It could only do 2-3 steps at the most.It was handled by a pretty gentle 6 year old, but still tangled and stretched out within days.So if you are looking to recreate the ""stair-walking slinly"", look for a bigger one."
3,I had thought it was bigger,"Not the product's fault but I had thought it would be bigger. My son had a larger diameter slinky and needed to replace it. This was the largest we could find. Would like to have had a 4"" diameter one."
4,It's a Slinky,"It is the original Slinky. It bends and becomes unusable quickly when younger children play with it. It's still fun for children, though.It lasted a couple of weeks with my two year old. I recommend waiting until the child is four or five to get one."
3,Not the quality it used to be.,"This says its the original slinky and yes, it looks and acts like the original was... it just isn't as hefty as it used to be."
4,Everyone Loves A Slinky - Recommended,"The ""Origional Slinky"" is one of the calssic toys I grew up with and made sure that my kids got to experiance as well.This is the metal version that works the best for walking down stairs (alone or in pairs :-) and makes the ""Slinkity"" sound.The only real down side is that it will, sooner or later, get tangled up and will have to thrown away... most likely to be replaced next Christmas (or insert gift giving day of your choice).Recommended!"

3,Original Slinky review,All the previous reviews about this product indicated that it does not roll down stairs and it is so true! Other than that it seems OK.
3,New use for slinky,I had seen on some gardening show suggesting to deter squirrels from climing your bird feeder poles to run the pole through the slinky. It did help some but there are still some smart squirrels figured out to put their feet between the slinky rings. Still better than nothing.
3,Fun for the kids while it lasts,"My kids bugged me to get one of these since they saw it in a store. I broke down and ordered on amazon. They had a blast with it for 2 days, now it is bent out of shape and is going in the trash. If you have roughneck kids down expect this one to last."
5,Back to basics,One of the best toys ever - that's why it's been around for years! My kids love it as much as I did as a kid.
1,Useless,"This toy did not work at all, not even one step. My kids threw it in a corner on Christmas day .If I could give it no stars I would. Don't buy it."
5,original slinky,I wanted an original slinky for my grandson. One that he could make go down the steps the way we did when we were kids. I didn't want one of the plastic ones you find in the stores. I got just what I wanted with this one and my grandson was thrilled.
1,I only wish I could give this book negative stars!!!!,The male in this book literally physically and emotionally tortures his wife. He holds her head under water not once but twice and almost kills her. Then he locks her in a house and interrogates her about her so called sexual past. I have never been so horrified in my life that a so called romance novel would allow the woman to stay with a guy like that.
5,A Tasty Little EP With Solid Tracks,"This EP is great. It was the ""teaser"" for fans who were getting restless between 1996's Static Prevails and 1999's Clarity. It had three songs from the upcoming Clarity- Lucky Denver Mint, For Me This Is Heaven, and Your New Aesthetic (which was an acoustic demo version compared to the straight-forward rock version on Clarity). It also had two non-Clarity tracks, which could have been on Clarity in my opinion. Softer is my favorite song on this cd. It is mindblowing live, it has an amazing texture of music and vocals inter-weaving into an amasing song. Roller Queen is a song Jim Adkins (vocals, guitar) did everything on. Think folk with experimental sounds. All in all, a worthy adition to have in any Jimmy Eat World cd collection (I know, it's in mine)"
4,this is great,this is great. There has been a lot of techno mixes and other material like that. This brings a rock feeling back again.
4,Good Training Aid,"Easy to setup, easy to take down, well built product. This portable hitting net, tee, and balls, is a great way to help my son stay sharp with his hitting skills. No more chasing balls or hitting those light 'whiffle' balls. Also, my son is able to practice his hitting by himself when no one is around and does not need a shagger to collect the balls. Also works for pitching, as you can throw to the net, which includes a preformed 'srike zone' target that hangs in front of the net (would be nice to have this target removable, but then again, I would probably loose it!)"
5,Every math teacher should have this book!,Book was in excellent condition and was shipped quickly. Great service! Will buy from seller again.
1,Nails on chalkboard sound better.,"Although the music sounds really nice for about 30 seconds of each ""song"", suddenly it dissolves into a morass of cacophony. The gothic vocals are wonderful, transporting you to another realm, when suddenly you are thrust into the depths of musical hell with a horrendous screeching guitar line. On one song, the flute was so out of tune that my teeth began to ache. Although the thought was a good one, I think too much ... cocaine annihilated any possible future for this cd. Please avoid at all costs -- unless you want to use it as a coaster or to dress up for Halloween as the worst audio experience EVER."
1,I'm gonna die!,"...I know whether or not something is music or not; let me just say that the only songs I actually listen to are: 1- Sing Hey, 4- I Sang of Leaves of Gold, and 5- Ever on and on Goes the Road...Too much Modern-earth and not enough Middle-earth."
1,Musicians Miss their Mark,"I a an obsessive Tolkien fan. Even so, I found the music of the Tolkien Ensemble to be pretentious and the melodies wandering and unfocussed.I was disappointed.There is no ""feel"" for the people, i.e., Elves, Dwarves, Men, or Hobbits, to whom the music is ascribed. There are too many basses and baritones, insufficient sopranos, too many accidentals, and no harps (!). I actually winced at one note in the duet between the Ent and the Entwife which is written to be flatted, why, I cannot fathom. High notes emphasize small words - of, on - and more important words are hurried together because the composer seems not to have taken the natural rythms of Tolkien's poetry into account. A much better effort is Broceliande's ""The Starlit Jewel"" with music written by Marion Zimmer Bradley and others."
4,Another perfect purchase for my granddaughter,I was unexpectedly in a position where I was in a hospital setting with my granddaughter and we had to spend hours sitting and waiting for a family member. Fortunately WiFi was available and I had my Kindle Fire. I purchased Dora and she was enthralled with one of her favorite characters. I was so happy I had my Kindle Fire and that she was able to watch Dora and also a movie which I had in the cloud. Thank You!
1,hORRIBLE QUALITY - bLACK SCREEN WITH ONLY VOICES,tHE SHOWING OF dORA GOES TO A BLACK SCREEN SHORTLY INTO THE SCREENING. tHIS WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. i WILL NEVER DOWNLOAD UNBOXED ITEMS AGAIN AS THEY ARE NOT GOOD QUALITY. dON'T EVEN BOTHER. JUST BUY THE dvd!
4,Goal-oriented,"I am currently a fourth year medical student on an infectious disease rotation. I find this book fairly helpful, notably the first chapter where it pretty much sums up everything you forgot from your microbiology course. The chapters are generally written well, but (as the publishers claim) a lot is really a review. So, if you want a brief overview of HIV/AIDs, this is the text to use, but if you want to know in depth HAART therapy, you might want to try something else. It is a fairly large book, which makes me unenthusiastic to carry around - a minus for those on-the-go medical students. As a supplement (and if you are working a consult service), I found the Washington Manual(R) Infectious Diseases Subspecialty Consult book to be very helpful."
4,comprehensive,"was recommended for online exam but some questions remained unanswered... interesting, good read, great transition and chapters, nice for augmentation of I.D."
1,GALILEO THERMOMETER,"YOUR SERVICE WAS FAST AND EFFICENT, THE ITEM CAME CAREFULLY PACKAGED SO THERE WASN'T ANY DAMAGE.I WOULD ORDER AGAIN WHEN I NEEDED A HARD TO FIND ITEM OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER......"
3,An average Star Trek novel,A semi-interesting book about Captain Kirk's youth. It's thrilling at times. A good-read for anyone who rides the subway and has nothing to do than staring at other passengers
4,A very good Star Trek novel,"Best Destiny is a very good Star Trek novel. Apart from a continuity error (Forty-five years earlier USS Enterprise 1701-A) should read (USS Enterprise 1701). Best Destiny was an excellently crafted novel and sequel to Diane Carey's ""Final Frontier"". Not to be confused with the sub-standard fifth Star Trek Movie.This novel begs a movie (starring David Caruso and Jeremy Irons perhaps ) as Commander George Samuel Kirk and Captain Robert April. The Red headed, hot tempered Star-fleet Security officer and his laid back avuncular English captain's second secret mission together on the original USS Enterprise."
5,High Grade for these Suspenders!!,"These leather suspenders I highly recomend. They are simple, and compfortable. Easy to adjust. Look great!"
2,Leather Suspenders,The Suspenders are fine except one of the tongues or the buckles was put it the wrong way and the fastening of this one is not as secure as the correct buckle and the tongue sticks awkwardly out. I will have to take it to a leather shop to have the problem fixed. Other than that product is fine.
4,Wonderful,"Another Berger and Mitry Mystery, wonderful, wonderful and wonderful. This is a neat, witty mystery. The two protagonist are so different and engaging you want to read it just to get to know them better. This is a such a classic mystery that never disappoints. I always wait for the next Berger and Mitry Mystery with anticipation and glee."
3,Nimbus Sign Some Good Singers,"In my opinion this is not Sulochana's best (that is on Makar records, and has her singing a Bhairav raga), but it's still good. It may be that I simply prefer the compositions on the Makar CD. Her voice is soft, but not pop-ballad soft like Asha or Lata. Never shrill. Her khyal is unhurried, with slow meends. The Sarangi accompaniment by Sultan Khan, one of the top four players alive, is most soulful. Probably not the best disc to introduce newcomers to khyal music, but if you've developed an ear for it and you want to hear what the Rampur gharana is up to these days - buy. 3 stars from me is not bad; I would give 4 stars to her Makar CD, which I ADORE. But I like to retain the 5-star reviews for records that practically change lives. It deserves to be added that the obligatory Filler Piece (TM) on this item is a TAPPA, a rarely recorded song form from the Punjab (long taans right up yer nose) - which should have definite appeal with ""world-music fans""."
2,"It could be good, but...","The whole DVD is just this guy talking in a chair for about 2 hours! Yes, what he's saying could be helpful, but there are better books out there to learn this stuff. I just assumed that a video, would have... video of certain techniques to use. Needless to say I was quite disappointed."
3,Found a solution,"I found an example application in the book that was close to what I was working on. Although the write up was a little short, it showed I was on the right track. I wish they also included example program code so I could use some of the features the application example demonstrated. Quite useful."
2,Too much doggie time,"I didn't hate it but close...the story is boring and obvious - we know what's going to happen (which can be ok but we do need some exciting stuff to keep us interested right ?)- I am a dog lover but I do not let my dog lick my face.. it is sooo disgusting and she keeps talking about it over and over again. I mean this book is not bad but while reading it I kept feeling bored, uninterested, uneasy and also what's up with always having gorgeous lesbian characters ? I mean don't we see enough beautiful models on TV and feel bad about it ? It's a book - the main characters can be average looking and it's still ok...PS : sorry if I made some mistakes, I am not an English native writer,speaker."
2,What a routine story,I didn't mind that the outcome of the story was a given. After all it's a romance story. It was that so much in between was equally predictable.
1,Fail.,"This pulley lasted several months before the bearing wore out. Overall, I must say I was very disappointed. Could have been just my luck perhaps. Either way for the cost I can't complain to much as it was a low cost investment but it would have been nice if it had lasted."
4,opinion,"This album hits home if it is communed with. These are people here. Exposing themselves. Speaking about what they've seen, thought, heard. That's part of what artists do. Humble, hearty, and handsome folks. They don't need designer or name brand clothing. The realization that life is beautiful in it's natural state leads to the earth and a renaissance balanced of tomorrow and yesterday seems in order today."
3,DVD is faulty.,"I was really happy when I got this because it delivered in about a day. The ball is smaller than the one used in the video, but I didn't mind. For me, the pace of the video was perfect, not too fast, not too slow. However, ten minutes into the dvd, it started freezing. It would fix itself for a couple seconds and then it would work, but after about a minute or so, it froze completely and I couldn't even fast forward or anything. I took out the dvd to see if it was dirty or had scratches and it looks fine. I put it back in and tried to play it, and it was still stuck and freezing. I don't think it is my dvd player, because I use it on a regular basis and it has never done that before. I'm not really tech-savy, so I have no idea what the problem could be."
3,Ball is too small,"I love the video, but at 5-8 and with larger hands the ball is too small to use for balance for any of the exercises that you do while laying on your side. It gave great resistance when placed between the knees or ankles, but overall I'm disappointed in the size."
4,Gift -arrived early,Arrived earlier than expected - was pleasantly surprised. Did not see the product as it was gifted to someone else
1,Not worth the money,This product is a joke - its not worth the money asked for - the DVD in the box did not contain enough and barely required the ball to do the exercises - I actually thought that I was purchasing a pilates squishy ball not a hard unweighted ball. I do not recommend the purchase of this product.
3,Gaiam Pilates,"Was so excited to get this product. The directions say you can just take it out of the box and get started. The video is just over 30 min. long. It's pretty easy. More of a beginners workout. One thing I don't like, is that the ball they send you is way smaller than the ball that's being used in the video. I tried to put more air in it, but the ball got really hard and not much bigger. I think it would be better with an appropriate sized ball."
3,Body sculpting ball,"I really thought it would be a much more pliable ball but it's very rigid and sadly, I don't get any use out of it as a result."
4,Outrageous Stunts,"This could have been a five-star film. But the directors excised Wesley and Yancey's love scene (it didn't fly with test audiences, pun intended), and these two have tremendous chemistry (plus, any chance to see Yancy Butler nude must be pursued). But the stuntwork is incredible, and even the hokiest stunt -- Snipes' mid-air pursue of a parachute-less Butler -- is romantic. Great INXS song at the end of the flick."
3,"Not Very Real, But Good Fun","Let's face it, this was a fun movie and I liked it. I enjoy most flicks with Wesley Snipes in 'em. And, although a novice, I love skydiving. That was the fun part. From Yancy dumping Snipes from the Porter sans parachute to their makeshift tandem nighttime landing on a rooftop, it was ridiculously fun in a silly way. Imagine becoming skilled enough to jump in a major big-way in what, two weeks' time? Great. And the absurdity of the skydivers being anything but friendly and open to a ""whuffo"" (a ground-grabbing outsider) made for a top-order, unimagineable fight scene. Great stuff. I just hope that when my main canopy snivels and I can't break away, I make out as well as their jumping buddy... i.e., live through the experience. Blue Skies and Fair Winds! Watch the movie, then jump from a perfectly good airplane from 2 & 1/2 miles up."
4,Good movie,I think Drop Zone was a pretty good movie. Not one of my favorites. That is why I only gave it four stars. I enjoy the scenes when they are jumping out of the plane with their cool outfits. I would like to do that. But I need someone to be attach to me to do it.
5,Snipes Fan,I bought this for my husbend but I really like this movie too. It's a Wesley Snipes sleeper movie that IMHO is way to good to be missed.
2,dumb movie,"I like Wesley Snipes and usually enjoy his flicks, with that said I have to say this one was bad. Silly, dumb story thatstarted out good but quickly went downhill. The visuals of skydiving were great (which is why I gave two stars instead of one), but the story needed some CPR"
2,Skydiving,"If you're a skydiver, you'll love this movie. For everybody else, it's boring. It's not a typical action-packed Wesley Snipes movie. This one focuses on skydiving, and that's about it. Lots of skydiving, and then some more skydiving. They just threw in some token fight scenes at random to help tone it down, but it doesn't work. I gave it ** because Snipes is in it. Without him, it would get *."
4,Keep Case Please,"Love this old movie.. Will buy it when it is released in a Keep Case, as long as its wide screen."
4,...so bad that it's good...,"What starts as just a (bad) old-school Holywood western gets REALLY confused when the cowboys stumble upon a palientologist on the railroad tracks then break out the claymation dinosaurs. I can't wait to see ""Cowboys And Aliens"" now!NOTE: Rock climbers will drool at the formations forming the entrance to The Valley. That few seconds of footage alone is worth the price of the DVD."
2,"Well, nostalgia aint all it's cracked up to be...","This is one I should have left in ""The Good 'Ol Days."" Still, the animation is so cheesy that it is a fun flick."
4,they grow em big south of the border!,"Ray Harryhausen adapted a Willis O'Brien story to create another magical fantasy. It goes without saying that the sfx are wonderful, the settings exotic and the final scenes frantic. The actors vary from the endearing Laurence Naismith & eohippus,the bland James Franciscus & Gila Golan, to the ridiculous Indian woman & the obligatory annoying kid. Sadly, Ray can control dinosaurs but not ham actors."
1,What in hell did you send me?,"This video, for some idiotic reason cannot be played on my DVD, or, my Laptop.. I pay money, and you send me garbage, made in some backward, 3rd world country! Why could I not be sold videos that can played on my DVD AND my Laptop? You once sold me excellent first rate videos; now that I'm a customer, you've now resorted to passing on garbage to me.. KEEP THE MONEY! I never thought your people would stoop to thievery..!"
1,bad dealer,"I purchased this video without knowing that a DVD made in the UK will not play on American DVD players. It requires a multi-regional player, which is hard to find and expensive. I contacted the seller and he stated that he would refund the purchase price, but not shipping. No problem, I can understand that. However; I returned the DVD and I have not heard from him, nor has he responded to emails."
3,Campy,"A step up from BEAST FROM HOLLOW MOUNTAIN ... a fun watch with kids who like dinosaurs. Has the best line in a movie of ths genre --- When a mexican riding a horse is surprised by the beast, he exclaims ""Gwangi"", turns and rides away. Now I know what ""Gwangi"" means."
3,About Gila Golan in VOG,Gila was a knockout! Due to Franciscus's part in both this and Beneath The Planet of The Apes comparisons have been made of Golan to Linda Harrison (Nova in BTPOTA). I read another found Harrison more attractive but I say Golan is Linda Harrison's physical equal. Golan is also a good actress. Her genuine warmth she demonstrates with the hyracotherium (mini ancient horse) is touching and this and in other ways in the film she shows to be a very fine actress.
4,Gwangi!,"In the movie its about a bunch of cowboys from mexico who run a cheap circus,a girl named Tj has a x boyfriend named tuck who comes along.The first thing they do is go to a gypsy ground and they the valley has a curse but like in king kong they go to the forbiddan valley and encounter a ptertactle,stragosaurs,and gwangi a fercious allosaur.gwangi eats the other dinosaurs and is lassoed but it doesnt work so gwangi gets knocked out by rocks and is captured."
1,Right down there with Sinbad & Eye of Tiger,"The film is a total letdown. The blue coloring of Gwangi`s hide, the fake looking oversize props like Gwangi`s head, the rubbery pterasaur, the dwarf that becomes wider & taller when Gwangi snaps him up. How about the annoying trumpeting of the elephant? It is so obviously a human doing a bad, very bad imitation of an elephant. And finally poor Gwangi trapped inside the burning church roaring in pain. This is one film where I wanted the monster to win."
1,Poor to View,"I bought one of these ICF-C180 Clock Radios for my wife's birthday. I thought it was one of the best clock radios I have ever bought so I purchased 4 more for my kids. After using it for awhile, my wife, kids and I noticed that if the ICF-C180 Clock Radio is placed above you slightly, like on a higher night stand or on a nook right above your head, you cannot read the time at all. You have to lift your head up to be parallel with the display before you can read the time. This is extremely irritating. It I am surprised that no one at Sony caught this defect. Most LCD read outs have a way to adjust the display angle. If the clock is going to be parallel when viewing, this is an excellent clock radio because of the 4 adjustable times that can be set. I cannot recommend this ICF-C180 Clock Radio because of the poor viewing."
2,DST button made me late for work!,"I inadvertently pushed the DST button along with the snooze button this morning, effectively waking up at 7:00 am this morning, when it was actually 8:00 am - the time I'm supposed to be at work!The dial is also hard to read, and the LCD backlight is a little too bright for me.Otherwise i like the auto time set feature, the weekend button, and the 4 possible alarms is nice too."
3,Sony Radio,"Although i like the clock, in downstate, NY it appears the time is off by 1 or 2 minutes.There is no way to set the clock.Blackouts or loss of electricity: When the power is returned the clock lights up with the actual time exceptas indicated above.What I do is set the alarm 2 minutes earlier to account the time indicated on the sony,"
1,Clock Radio,"It didn't work on one side from day one. Unfortunately, I waited until after the warranty period to complain. Sony's solution was to give me the chance to buy a refurbished one for $110!!! Very disappointed with their idea of customer service."
1,Warning Not As Described,I just returned this item to Amazon. My main reason for buying this alarm clock was to have seperate weekend/weekday alarms always set so I can't forget and wake up late. It does not let you keep all 4 alarms set all the time so really you only have 2 alarms. That is the same as any other alarm clock. You have to remember to switch it from weekday to weekend and then back again! Its just a pointless gimmick that does not really work.
2,Giving up on it,"We've had this clock for two years. It seems like it should be a great clock, and it has some nice features, but there are two things wrong that we just can't live with, so we are getting a different one.1) The display is so bright, even on the dim setting, that we have to turn it to face the wall and push it right up against it to block the light. So it's just not very handy for seeing what time it is!2) There are many buttons on the top and the face of the clock and it really is easy to unwittingly hit the wrong button when you've been yanked out of a deep sleep in the pre-dawn hours. With it turned to the wall, I have to turn it around to get at the OFF button, and often hit snooze in the process.I'll give it two stars, since we did make it work for two years, but I'll never know how we managed it."
4,"Great reception, many features, but too bright","We've always had trouble getting a good reception with our clock radios, but not with this one. Reception is crystal clear, and this clock radio has lots of great features to boot (such as a nap timer, dual alarms, and more). I can only give it four stars out of five, though, because the display is simply too bright, even on the ""low"" setting, especially when you have the alarm function turned on. It's like having a night light right next to my bed, and I prefer the room to be completely dark when I'm going to sleep. I'll keep using it, though."
2,Terrible LCD,This Sony clock has a terrible LCD. I can't see time from low angle. The LCD sucks. I have to put 2 books under the clock to change the angle. I will never buy a Sony Clock again.
1,Too bright,"We've had Sony clock radios for twenty years. The new one is way to bright. We tried it in our bedroom and because it was so annoying we transferred to our guest suite. The guest we had for Christmas, said it was so bright they couldn't sleep, so they got up and put it in a drawer. We threw it away after our guests left!!"
4,Good little inexpensive radio for limited use,"I originally ordered this to replace my bedside clock radio which is starting to get weird on me after many years -- the problem with this Sony cube is that you cannot see the time from above it (like when I'm in/out bed) or from below it (I have an old version of this I use for kitchen music which sits on a pantry shelf & plugs into the adjacent wall, but since it sits about 6"" higher than my head, the time on this new model is too difficult to read from that angle) -- the time is only perfectly readable if the radio sits at eye level. If you don't care about seeing the time because you have other clocks in the room and just want the music/alarm/snooze functions, then it's a cute little radio with adequate sound (don't think Bose)."
2,This alarm clock is SO bright I can't sleep....,"The set up of the dual alarms is very nice, but the display is entirely too bright for an alarm clock. I have to turn it around every night so the bright green and orange lights don't keep me awake. Beware...."
3,Major fault,"I have simple requirements for a clock radio, but one of the primary ones is that I be able to see the time display during the night which I couldn't on this clock. The light behind the numbers was so bright, even on dim, that I thought I had a green night light in my room. If I'd turned the brightness up, I'd have been able to read by the light. I read many reviews of this product, and only a few people mentioned this flaw. I'm very disappointed since the rest of the clock has some great features. But if I can't read the time, it's gotta go back."
4,"Excellent, but","This is very easy alarm clock to use. My only complaint is the LCD screen which must be viewed directly, it's hopeless to see it at an angle. I would buy it again anyway."
5,"For the price, excellent product","For those that say hitting the top of the clock activates the daylight savings, they must have very bad aim. The snooze button is a very large button that runs across the entire front top of the clock (about 1 inch deep and 3 inches wide). When the alarm goes off, you can hit the snooze to give you 10, 20, 30, ... extra minutes. A nice but dangerous feature. This is an excellent alarm for the price. My only complaint is the brightness. The regular time can be hard to read from the other side of the bed (green back drop with black numbers). On the other Dream Machines I own, it is a non-lighted black backdrop with green LED numbers. This is preferable. When the alarms are activated, the lower boxes appear as an orange backdrop with black numbers. Even on dim, this kicks out more light than I would like. Some may like this as it also then functions as a night light."
3,All Ok except the display,"I purchased this clock and used it for three days before returning it.It had all the features I wanted:Weekday, weekend alarm settingsEasy to setupCompact size.The only drawback that prompted me to return it is the display visibility.It is LCD and the viewing angle is limited the higher the radio is placed. I had it on an armoire or about 3ft higher than my head when viewing laying in bed. The digits very difficult to see during the day and night. I then moved it to a lower piece of furniture. It was now clear enough to see during the day but rather faded looking at night. My distance vision isn't what it used to be so in the mornings I could not see the time unless I sat up in bed and was looking down on it. I tried setting the backlight to high which helped but then there was too much light at night.If you don't have vision issues and/or will be placing the clock so you look down on the display then it should be ok.I ended up going to an LED display clock."
3,OK clock radio but no sound adjustment,"This is a nice little clock radio with the terrific feature of automatically updating the time when we switch to and from daylight savings time. BUT the alarm has a puny sound which didn't wake me from a sound sleep, and the alarm volume cannot be adjusted. If you are a light sleeper, this would be a great clock radio for you."
4,like the product but ........,I like the Sony clock radio. Really liked the dual alarms and the controls. However the display leaves something to be desired . It is hard to read the time unless you are looking straight at it and even on the dim setting it is so bright it casts shadows on the wall .
1,"some ""improvements"" aren't improvements","Bought this clock to replace an old, well-loved Sony Dream Machine. The supposed innovation here? The time is set at the factory and kept by an internal battery; the owner chooses his/her time zone and voila! Only problem: Should the backup battery die before purchase, as mine did, there's no way to set the time, even if one replaces the battery. In this event, one is to take the clock ""to a Sony dealer""! I'm sending mine back to Amazon. Personally, I never found setting a clock all that onerous."
3,It's okay... cheap... but... way too bright,"I like the features of this alarm clock radio, but the display is SOOOOO BRIGHT! It could work as a nightlight if you need one. Otherwise I have to put a book over it at night."
4,convenient,My main reason I bought this was for the separate nap setting which allows me to set the alarm during the day for a nap without changing the normal alarm settings I use in the morning. The display brightness is fine for me. I don't use the radio so I'm not a good judge of its quality.
5,The best ever!,"This clock radio is the easiest one I've ever had to program. Everything is clearly marked, the time is automatically set according to your time zone, and the dual alarm system is simple and quick to set. I highly recommend this item for those who are low tech types like me."
1,Unacceptable,"TRASH. The button that sets the clock in and out of daylight savings time is right on top of the clock and is activated by a single touch. So you're fumbling for the snooze button and, SURPRISE, you instead set the clock off daylight savings time. You'll get a rude surprise the next morning when you're an hour late for work.Sony should know better than this, much better. Now I have to go to the trouble of sending the blasted thing back to amazon."
2,"Honey, did you set the alarm? . . .","I bought the above Sony after having gone through two Timex Nature Sounds in about five years. The Timex had great features but poor reliability. From the description and reviews the Sony seemed comparable plus it had the added attraction of a nap timer. I also liked that you could set an alarm for weekdays and another for weekends. Imagine my surprise this past Saturday when I was awakened at my weekday time of 6:30 am! That's when I realized that there is no DATE display on this clock. This means you must remember to turn on the alarm on Sunday night and turn off the alarm on Friday night (for weekday-only alarm). Who needs that, especially when so many other clock radios in the same price range have the date feature."
2,SONY ALARM CLOCK/RADIO,"This is the second Sony cube clock/radio I have owned.. The first one lasted 25 yrs. I see the improvements made.. I like everything better EXCEPT it is difficult to see time in darkness..The background light is good, but the digital numbers are not dark enough.."
2,WAY too bright,"Works OK. Buttons are not as intuitive as other brands so you have to be fairly awake to turn it off. It is too easy to switch to ""weekend"" mode without realizing and then the next day your alarm will not go off. Actually I wound up setting the weekend alarms to the same times in case this happens. I am shopping for a replacement because it is extremely bright compared to LED models, which I am going back to as soon as I find the perfect one."
1,Innocent Blood,"This would have to be one of the worst, most boring, elephantine padded book it has ever been my misfortune to try and read The story is all padding and no substance. The plot is thin and could have been explained, disclosed and finished in six chapters at the very most, every move, thought and action was described in minute detail and over and over again. Who cared about what happened at court with the adoptive mother, who cared about how the daughter did up the flat, who cared about how the idiot man walked about and where he walked and what he thought. Just these three items took nearly whole chapters to cover and they added absolutely nothing to the story and there was a lot more of this type of thing to struggle through. Very bad read, do not recommend it to buy. Not one of P D James's best unfortunately."
1,Overcompensation,"In this particular book P.D. James is overcompensating for her insecurities as a mystery writer. She wants to prove that mystery is a legitimate genre and therefore infuses this book with crass psychology, characters that expound literary quotes at the drop of a hat, and sensationalism. The characters are woven to be so complex that ironically they turn out to be simply one dimensional. Her tone for the treatment of victims (especially the rape victim) is absolutely infuriating and frightening. Pick up a copy of the National Enquirer...it's cheaper and more entertaining."
3,no title,"I don't know about this book - it made me read to the end to see what happened - and the ending should have been at the end of Book III, but all the way through I could see and feel the writer writing. That's not good. But the characters were extremely well-drawn, very complete and whole. Much like Le Carre in her meticulous attention to detail - too much so - got in the way sometimes. Plot forced and too coincidental at times. And didn't really like Phillipa, the heroine, if you will. Many good individual lines that I highlighted in the book - especially ""in whom we live and move, and have our being"" and ""an artist should suffer in childhood as much trauma as could be borne without breaking"". Would have helped to be more familiar with London. Whose innocent blood? Julie's or Mrs. Ducton's? Several cliches and trite phrases used. Also murder manuscript not plausible. Too overwritten."
2,Wrong choice,"In all innocence and as a lover of P.D. James' works, I purchased ""Innocent House,""and was astonished when I received a thin paperback. I was even more astonished to learn that this paperback was simply an EXCERPT from a novel and not the novel itself. True, I did not pay much for it, but I would not have bothered to waste even that sum and time if I had known what ""Innocent House"" really was. I had already read the original novel, but even if I hadn't I don't know what that excerpt would have accomplished.The seller should have alerted buyers to what s/he was offering."
4,"A young woman, adopted at age 8, meets her birth mother.","This is a P.D. James novel sans Inspector Dalgleish. Itwas first published in 1980 and stands the test of timewell. The protagonist, Phillipa Palfrey, can hardly wait for her 18th birthday, for on that day she is legally free to consult public records about her birth. She learns much more than she bargained for and spends the next couple of months intimately involved with 2 strangers, one of whom she meets in a most unconventional way. This novel becomes more amd more grim as it proceeds to its unexpected and tragic climax."
5,BEST,"I've read all PD James' work, but this one is best she's done. Finished it a few weeks ago,but it still haunts me."
5,Incredibly Original and Well Written,"This is a very well thought out piece of fiction that has so much more going on than murder. In the end, irony even manages to deliver a wonderful twist on the expected murder. Perhaps the leading issue in the book is adoption and the ""truth"" of one's origins. It has to be the ultimate of elusive concepts and perhaps it is better to live with the fantasies of one's origins than to take advantage of the new laws which open up one's adoption records. This is what Phillipa Pallfrey does on her 18th birthday. She sets out to the government office intent on finding out the truth about her aristocratic biological father's abandonment of her pregnant parlor maid mother. What she finds instead is that her parents are two notorious criminals, he a rapist and her a murderess. What follow from there is a fictional marvel and wholly unexpected. I've read a ton of crime and mystery fiction and this is one of the very best books out there in that genre."
5,amazed,"this is really a quality recording of earlier phish. the sound quality is really good too. lots of energy put into this end of tour return-to-vermont concert. i especially liked the lengthier 'chalkdust' as compared to hampton or a live one. 'lizards' is amazing live and this cd does it justice, definitely some good live phish. solid all the way through. pick this up, some previously unreleased tunes on it and great jamming will keep everyone bumpin yo. peace man"
4,An excellent show for phish phans,"This might not be the best show for someone who has never listened to phish before, but for fans this is a must have. The sound quality of this recording is excellent, and they are up to some great weirdness. The first disk is good but not great, but the next two disks make up for the slow start. during the Antelope Trey is yelling like a freak, while the playing is top notch. The naration during the Harpua is one of the best that I have heard. The Harry Hood is as rocking as any version I can think of. It must have been a great day to be at a show. Definitly one of the best shows from 1994."
5,Just get it.....,"Its a perfect representation of the band on the '94 timeline. Its fun, jammin', serious, Posternutbag-ish. Perfect encapsulation of Phish in the summer of '94. Great jams, some goofiness, pure '94 Phish."
4,elegant and witty diversion,This is that unusual mix : a scholarly intellectual polemic which is also hilarious in a dry Brit way - by a young scholar-writer who I hope will soon publish something else soon. The stuff on witchcraft and the conquest of the New World is fascinating and really elegantly done
5,excellent,"As a lover of only EXCELLENT gospel music this CD is a must have for any who are seeking only the best. Being on the west coast,Very little music of this high quality is heard.I stumbled upon it about two months and now I listen too it daily. Fellows, Keep up the good work and remember""The Only Way left Is Up."""
1,They murdered the story!,"Forget the first-person-viewpoint-camera nonsense, the REAL crime here is that Steve Fisher and Robert Montgomery hacked up and destroyed one of Raymond Chandler's best novels. By wasting a vast amount of money and talent on this vile travesty, they made ""The Lady In The Lake"" toxic and unfilmable for years, and Chandler's story -- unlike Fisher's ghastly mangling of it -- is eminently deserving of being made into a movie. The team that did ""L.A. Confidential"" would be excellent candidates, and I'd really like to see someone of the caliber of Kevin Spacey as Marlowe."
2,Daring. Unique. Unwatchable.,"Robert Montgomery's subjective camera version of Raymond Chandler's novel, one must assume, was met with the universal consensus: ""Well...now we all know that doesn't work."" With the hardworking cast addressing the camera as if it's Philip Marlowe, you feel like you're watching a 90-minute series of screen tests. The stunt would be laughable if it weren't so dull.The guys on the commentary refer to this as noir, and I hardly think so as half the movie's as MGM sun dappled as an Andy Hardy picture."
1,Must to Avoid,"I'm giving this film one star because I can't give it fewer -- the Amazon servers won't let me. This is possibly the worst detective film ever. My big fear is that someone unfamiliar with Film Noir and/or Raymond Chandler will see this and think that this is what it's all about. The objective camera ""experiment"" is fun for about 30 seconds -- long enough to realize Robert Montgomery dosen't have what it takes to play Phillip Marlowe. From there it's downhill. ""The Lady in the Lake"" is my favorite Chandler novel...it deserved so much better than this.If you happen to have this film and 1945's brilliant Dick Powell film ""Murder My Sweet,"" I'd advise you to watch ""Murder"" twice instead of watching them both."
5,Lady in the Lake (Philip Marlowe),This is one of my favorite Philip Marlowe movies.Robert Montgomery plays the part in such an unusualway. The movie is filmed through Marlowe's eyes andyou see what he sees. REALLY CLEVER.
4,PSYCHE OR PSYCHOLOGY,"I enjoyed this movie. Would it have been better if it wasn't POV? Definately. But is it what it is and is very different. I thought the cast was good except for Jayne Meadows. I didn't buy her as the femme fatale. The other thing that irks me is the Silver/Ursini commentaries. I usually enjoy them both and they are informative, but Ursini's insistance that noone watches a noir for plot or story is ridiculous. He made this statement in his ""Out of the Past"" commentary and he redoubles it here. I think this is called projection. He is projecting his ""psychology"" into the film. That's how he phrases it. He uses psychology when the term should be psyche."
4,Wow -- What a bunch of cranks!!,"I'm thinking the folks who write the reviews take themselves a little too seriously...This is my favorite Christmas movie--much more action than, say ""Miracle on 34th Street.""All kidding aside the movie is great fun, the camera technique an interesting approach, and Audrey Totter is wonderful. I think that anyone who doesn't relish this film for the great dialog between Totter and Montgomery is truly a grinch--(From memory) Adrienne Fromsett describing Marlowe's short story to ther publisher:""...so vivid, so full of life...what would you say it's full of, Mr. Marlowe?""Marlowe: ""Short sentences."""
1,Poor version of a Chandler classic,"This film is not anywhere near a faithful rendition of Raymond Chandler's novel. The alterations are quite gratuitous.This film becomes a run of the mill potboiler, any sensitivity, any depth are completely lost.Character personalities are butchered - especially that of Adrienne Fromsett.The weary knight in a rumpled trenchcoat, Marlowe emmerges as a smug bully.I stopped watching after about twenty minutes because I found it a waste of my time.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall show how Raymond Chandler should be filmed.Please read the book - Raymond Chandler and Philip Marlowe both deserve far better than this tripe."
5,DICKIE MOORE! -HES GOURGEOUS!,"yes, dickies in it hes soooooooooooo adorable & priceless in free wheeling hes just too cute to annoy a viewer hes such a little heart-breaker! not to mention- a gifted actor as well"
4,the heart has its reasons,very well done biography of Jean Vanier and his work with the handicapped people in France. He is an inspiration to all. VBronga
4,"Stellite, Autos, Indiana--very interesting","This book takes a deep look into Elwood Haynes' life and career which led him to the developments of Stellite and a 'Horseless Carriage"" -- the automobile.History buffs interested in Stellite, transportation or Indiana will certainly enjoy this book."
1,It's a waste of money,I bought this box of books for my son and found that there were old books inside. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone trying to prepare for the SAT.
3,melody just doesn't seem to work ...,"While some of the mixes on this single are not bad, this vocal and melody are just not made for the thumpin' mixes they were going for. Basically, it would have worked better as a series of dubs just borrowing snippets of the vocal. MIke Rizzo's mix shines in terms of making the most of the vocal. Eric Kupper's mix is light fluffy disco house, as is Pete Lorimer's mix. Chris Cox's mix is reminiscent of his Thunderpuss stuff, the only thing ruining it is---the vocal. And Peter Rafelson's More Trance mix is not the most trancy mix I've ever heard. I was incredibly disappointed by this package overall, considering all the great remixers. I'm hoping it will grow on me after a few more listens."
3,I could do without the Mormonism...,"This woman is very, very Mormon, and it shows obviously in her book. While it is a decent book, I do think it could have done just as well without the 'God' bits. I had wanted to use this method simply because I wanted to try a bit of herbalism, but got distracted by the many religious comments--I had to skim most of the book instead of study it. Anyway, aside from the annoying (to me) religious bits and the...hm...writing style (it simply bothers me for unknown reasons), it's decent. I like the method she teaches and the herbal reference sheets in the back are also helpful. I also had no idea about the yeast and those other viruses. I like that she helps give ideas for cleanses, even if she doesn't give suggestions for meals during those cleanses (which I dearly wish she would have done).So, yes. 'It's decent' is what I'm going with. The information is great, but the writer...bothers me."
1,Not for Everyone,"This is classic 40's recorded by some of the ""Greats""(Goodman, Miller, Shaw) perverted by being performed by one band I never heard of. However; was a good band, just not up to this challenge."
4,"Thorough, albeit dated history of Latin America","Hubert Herring's History of Latin America is a thorough, excellent introduction of the twenty-some nations that comprise Central and South America (Haiti and DR included). Largely a political history, Herring does spend more time on the bigger countries (Mexico, Brazil, Argentina) but gives good outlines of all. Especially commendable is the credit the author gives to pre-European influences the Maya, Aztec, Inca and Chibcha peoples had on the region. While this is now commonplace in historical texts, I did not expect such liberal coverage of this as well as the post-colonization African influence. The text does end with 1966, which is extremely frustrating considering the incredible volatility most of Latin America experienced in the 1970s and into the 1980s. Still, this is a worthy read for anyone seeking to learn more about a region that is almost totally ignored in the public schools."
3,Taking a new direction,"This latest release by Wolfstone showcases a new line-up that rose out of a two year transitionary period. The music reflects not only the change in personnel but a slight change in attitude. Stuart Eaglesham, the band's guitarist/vocalist, steps forward (perhaps unintentionally) to take on the primary focus for this new Wolfstone. The music doesn't kick as forcefully as their first four releases. The Scottish flavor that was so prevalent in their previous releases is also dulled. This band was always great in concert - making even their hard-edged recordings seem tame afterwards. (I've seen them twice and was completely knocked out each time!) I just hope that the music on this CD is not indicative of a restrained performance for any future live shows."
2,Too soft and boring,"I can't do anything else than agree with Björn. The instrumnetals are rather good, but when they're singing it becomes awfully soft, boring and indifferent."
2,disappointment again - for the last time,"I am owner of all their albums, but this one and ""This strange place"" are big disappoinment for me. Without energy, without invention, bored laddies can only bore."
2,Too soft and boring,"I can't do anything else than agree with Björn: The instrumentals are rather good, but when they're singing it's just awfully soft, indifferent and boring."
3,"Not exactly a ""how-to"" book","While this book gives general instructions on machine quilting and it has some interesting quilting pattens, I found it was too long-winded and self serving. It doesn't deal with hand quilting at all. Most of the quilts shown (and poorly photographed) are of the author's making.I will say that it does do a good job of showing how to mark quilt tops with some basic patterns.All in all, I was disappointed in this book."
2,Not the best design,"The internal storage for the marbles on this isn't very well designed at all. The metal stoppers for the holes you put the marbles in are hard to pull out (I break my nails every time). The marbles roll all over especially when taking them out or putting them away. Nine Men's Morris is a fun game though, and sorta obscure and historical which I like."
4,Nine Men's Morris,I bought the gameboard for my son. He is 5 years old. We were expecting a bigger board. We have to change the red and blue marbles for some bigger. We have had great time playing.
3,Decen anime with some CGI,"Pretty standard anime, but no Ghost in the Shell. CGI noticeable but not overbearing. Story dragged a bit, but not so much to lose your interest."
5,Turns Into Pants!,"The pictures provided here do not do this guy justice. Trust me, he has a great racing truck mode as well as an awe inspiring robot mode. But the best thing about this figure is his third mode, not pictured here, ... Pants!Yes, pants. Of all the Energon figures, Rodimus makes perhaps the best lower half for a combined bot. He looks very nice as the bottom of deluxe class Optimus (That's the smaller one, Kmart exclusive.) and considering the history the two have together both in the Energon line and in previous versions of the franchise this pairing just seems so natural. So go ahead, treat your Energon collection to a new pair of pants. You'll be glad you did."
3,Where is the current website?,"Early in my review of this book I attempted to access the advertised associated online resource. Listed only on the back cover of the paperback as [...]. This URL is immediately coverted to [...]. Has the online resource been discontinued or is there a new URL address? I understand there are multiple errors in the later chapters of the book, listed in Errata on the web site. The utility of the book is degrade if the online site is no longer available."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This is the worst CD I have bought in YEARS! Morsheeba seems to have all of the right elements. The music is good, the singing is good, but it does not fit. I think the writing and lyrics are a bit off and may the reason that it does not come together. I am a very open minded person and I look for the good in everything, but just could not find it here."
1,Not as discribed,"This item is not as discribed. The picture is accurate, but the discription is misleading. It is a powder puff and container. Powder not included. Not a purse spray."
3,"Note: ""classic"" XBox only, not XBox 360","A word of advice for XBox 360 users, specifically those like myself who are coming to the 360 from the PC world, and may not be as familiar with what's compatible between the original XBox and the 360: the SmartJoy Frag adapter is NOT compatible with the 360. The connector on the Frag is intended to fit a ""classic"" XBox controller port, and will not work with the USB ports on the 360. And substituting the USB end-cable from a 360 controller also does not work, as the ""breakaway"" connector is incompatible as well.I have no complaint with the SmartJoy Frag device itself (not having tried it). Just wanted to save other 360 owners the disappointment of picking this up and not being able to use it. (A pity, too, since from reviews it sounds like the Frag is a better deal, price and feature-wise, than similar devices that _are_ intended for the 360!)"
3,The Miracle of the Bells,I haven't read the book yet but I got it promptly and it looks like a good book. Bought it because it was written the year I was born and I wanted to see what it would be like.
3,Text is good. The publisher is sloppy!,"I used this text for my Introduction to Film and Film Studies course. It was usually an easy to read and understand text. The main problem that I have with the text itself is the examples used. I highly doubt that introductory students have seen a lot of the films used such as Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" and Resnais's ""Last Year at Marienbad"". The authors might want to consider using examples from films that are a little more widely viewed than Eisenstein's films.If you're a prof and considering this book, please make sure that what you call a tracking shot actually matches what the textbook says. If you don't, it can create endless confusion.Also, the publisher of this book really need to go into the text and fix some problems. More than once I was told that an example was on page 000 and there's a section in the mise-en-scene chapter that says that information has been removed and should be put back in. This can be confusing and also makes the book look sloppy."
4,Much Better Deal,I needed to get his book for a college course and wanted to buy it on the cheap (I'm a college student!). It was easily the cheapest here on Amazon.
5,the best meditation!,"i first witnessed sylvia browne on montel williams several years ago..and she gave me chills. she seems so ""right on"" and sincere. i've used and enjoyed these tapes. i've tried other meditation tapes but have never received the results that i've gotten from these tapes. i've never gone so deep as i have with sylvia's words. her sincerity and warmth come shining through as she helps you relax, heal and become a more spiritual person. i highly recommend these tapes:)"
4,"Sylvia is innovative and wonderful, but","I don't think this was her best book. I really enjoyed some of her others more, but did learn a lot from the chapters I've read so far. Definitly worth the purchase though if you need tools in your life! Most of all, keep an open mind. People should try and forget what they've learned in church or from society when they read Sylvia's books or listen to her audio products. The primary reason is Society's need to control people has altered the real lessons God & Jesus have given to us. If you listen to Sylvia's interpretations you will see that there is only 1 God who loves us and wants us to 'survive' life and return home to the other side where our real 'life' is. Happy reading!"
3,"Much touted ""strong flavor"" just tasted salty to me.","I bought a full case of these wanting to like them and made my decision taking into account other reviewers who said they found the flavor to be strong. I LOVE garlic, and Parmesan and was looking forward to a nice strong garlicky crisp.Unfortunately, the ""strong"" flavor was mostly of salt. The Parmesan flavor was present, but not really much evidence of garlic.I have only finished one bag and part of that was eaten during a blackout after hurricane Ike in which we had little else to eat that wasn't in the refrigerator (which we dare not open).Sorry. If you like a salty salty salty crisp, you will like these.Wish I knew what to do with the rest of them. I guess our local food pantry will benefit."
3,Sterling Silver Murano Red Beaded Millefiori Necklace,"The beads are pretty, but the chain at the top broke the second time I wore it. It was easy to fix, however"
3,"Great Text - ""Cheap"" Physical Quality","One would think for $150, this book could have been printed on heavier weight and better quality paper. Either Wiley went overboard in trying to lighten physical weight for the student to carry, or they're trying to sqeeze even more money from already ultra-high book price mark-ups.I also have the Fourth Edition -- That book has a heavier cover and tough paper pages. With this one, you need to be careful not to tear the pages, and forget highlighting as the ink will soak though 2 - 3 of the pages underneath. Dampness/humidity ... the pages warp and wrinkle.The text itself is top-notch."
3,ok,"the book is ok. i wish there was more examples; otherwise, its good. i learned what i needed to learn"
2,From an engineering student,"I liked this book going through it the first time, and I assume that the information in it is fairly standard for heat transfer courses, but I found severe drawbacks while using it a second time. The way the information is presented is too theoretical to use as a reference text. It is difficult to find equations since they are strewn throughout the text in a matter-of-fact way. The Index is very bare considering it is almost a 900 page text. Overall it is not very useful since it is difficult to open it up and check something quick that you may have forgotten about after a few years."
3,Killer 2nd disc. But sound quality and 1st disc lacking.,"If you are a diehard Phish fan, the live phish series probably isn't for you. You can get any of these shows through trading and the sound quality will most likely be better. These are 2 track SBD recordings which translates to......just OK sound. The second set of this show is must have, with killer versions of Tweezer, Timber, Halley's, NICU, and a nice Slave. Very fluid jams and segues make it worth getting. The first set is pretty standard but features a nice Llama and a fun Makisupa. Save your hard earned cash and have someone burn it for you, or get some blanks and trade for an audience recording, which you will probably be more happy with anyway."
1,Borrrrrrrrrring,"More wanna-be tough guy hardcore we've already a billion times before. How the heck did any of these bands ever make it to their 20's, having grown up on the streets, getting shot and knifed every two seconds? Gimme a break. This stuff is lame."
3,"Okay, but I was looking for something for kids to view",The video was good for an adult looking for information about Tai Chi and how children might be interested in learning it. I was looking for a video for my Grandchildren to watch and maybe learn some moves. I don't think it accomplished that goal. I will show my Grandchildren and see what their feedback is.
3,fragrance is nice,the nozzle on the spray head clogged up after a couple of months...other than that the price is good for this fragrance...not too overwhelming.
3,"Pleasant, but...","I found the fragrance to be a bit metallic at first, then the fragrance became softer and more mellow. Nice gardenia scent, but nowhere near Tuvache's Jungle Gardenia (sigh). The spray head was defective--only tiny drops that spray out about 2 inches--no mist, ever. I'm trying to find a sprayhead to replace it with. Nice bottle, but quite a disappointment overall. I happen to find all the Elizabeth Taylor fragrances metallic. I wonder what that ingredient is, and why it is used. If I wanted to smell like a floral robot...I'd move to Stepford."
5,"Liz Taylor ""Gardenia"" cologne","More than 25 years ago I had gardenias growing outside our bedroom window in east Texas. In the spring, when our windows were open, they smelled heavenly! So this cologne seemed to be what I needed to recall those memories. It's great. Scent lasts a long time, but not overpowering. Evokes the romance in one's life. I will probablly reorder a second bottle. Also would make great gift for Mother's Day or anniversaries."
3,Smells Good but Not Exactly Like Gardenias,"While this does not smell exactly like gardenias, it comes darned close and is a great light summer scent. When I want to turn up the volume, I spray it over some gardenia oil I bought at the Rennaissance Festival (formerly Planetary Perfumes but can't remember the current name of company - out of Ohio) and men seem to love it. And I love it. No other scent to me is more sensuous and heady than the scent of real gardenias and Elizabeth Taylor's version is a worthy addition to the limited choices available."
3,"Great Sales service, didnt like the perfume though","The item came in perfect condition and with a nice giveaway(mirror and comb) however, i didnt smell the perfume before and i purchased it coz i thought it smelled of a fresh gardenia . Well, there is nothing fresh about the perfume it is heavy and you smell old and outdated.. I didnt like it at all .. however fragrance net are great and i will continue to buy from them"
4,Great Smell!,I bought this perfume as it is a very clean smell and doesn't bother my allergies. A little bit goes a long way.
5,wonderful fragrance,This is my first time for trying this fragrance but I really do like it and would recommend it to others. The price is also very good.
3,"Should be called 'Jasmine' instead of 'Gardenia""","There is nothing remotely similar to the sweet and delicate smell of gardenias in this perfume. It's not a bad fragrance, not at all, it's just that it definitely has the strong and heady smell of jasmine and the title of 'Gardenia' is very misleading. This would be a nice fragrance to wear in the summer, as it's a very clean and brisk smell, but be warned that if you are a fan of the beautiful scent of gardenias, this is not the perfume to get. As far as I know, the only perfume currently available that captures a true gardenia smell is 'Island Gardenia' from Jovan/Coty."
2,Disappointed,"Not only does it NOT smell anything like gardenias...the fragrance totally disappears after like 2 hours. I was looking for a reasonably priced fragrance to wear to work, but sadly this is not it.Guess you get what you pay for. Liz could have done a lot better with this one.:("
4,good buy,"This is a good buy there are others out there if you search but, they cost a lot more so be happy and buy one if you like gardenia the smell lasts."
1,Not free shipping !! Amazon's fault??,"It says Free Shipping but this IS NOT TRUE! When I contracted AAA Perfume, they said it was Amazon's fault and it should not have said free shipping. I canceled my order, but it arrived anyway. I sent it back, and was told I wouldn't be charged. We'll see when my statement comes.Just be warned; it's rather expensive shipping charges."
1,Do NOT purchase!,This perfume is not worth the money. It does NOT last at all. What a joke! You are warned.
1,WASTE of money,"This is a $20 piece of junk. Easy to put together, but leaks all over during use. Cannot be used during a breezy day. Overall disappointment. I bought this for my 2 sons spiderman birthday party. I tried it out the day before and it was leaking water from everywhere. You would have to spend the time putting plumbers putty everywhere to make it work right. The idea is cool, but the product is cheaply made. The smallest breeze tips it and bends it, making the leaking worse. I do not reccomend this."
1,BOOOOORING AND SHALLOW,"TO WHOEVER REALLY WRITES THIS SERIES: PLEASE!!! Most of what you wrote in this book is soooo dull and boring. I realize there are a lot of girls out there who are followers and they will read whatever someone tells them is cool which is why this trash is popular, but come on!! If you want to read a good series that has some depth and believability read THE A LIST BOOKS such as BLONDE AMBITION. Yes, the main character Anna has a functioning brain AND a sense of morality. Shocking, huh?? Girls, use your time for something better than this trash. Yawn."
4,The Gossip Gurls Are Back!,"In this instalment of the Gossip Gurl searies, I feel it is manily about the stress of getting into collage. The eariler books are just about theier frindships and strange connectins with each other. I think it would be boaring for someone younger than 15, and inapropite, as all the gossip gurl books are, for someone under 13. Thanx! :)"
5,They just keep getting better...,"I am a huge gossip girl fan, and was estatic to learn that the 6th one had come out. My mom immediatly got it for me. I've slowly been reading it and finished it in about 5 days.And all i have to say, is that these books just keep getting better and better!!!Their college acceptence letters came, and well its not what you'd expect at all. There are a lot of changes that happen within a short period of time. (the whole book prolyl happens within 2 weeks form start to end) BUT if you love any of the gossip girls, you will not be dissapointed with this one!!"
1,parent alert,Please take a look at these books before you give to your preteen or young teen. The characters are not appropriate and there is not accountability for immorality. Poor life lessons.
3,great book,it left me hanging out the end and i had to wait about a year for the next book. but besides that it was great. Yeah the books are a little racy and slutty well some of the characters are but adults and teenage must realize that its a pretty good painted picture of real teenage life well except the kids being rich. But real teenagers to confront some of the issue in these book and if you can't handle the truth get outta the book store.
3,"Not The Best, Readble Though","This was NOT the best book in the GG series. I love the GG series but I have to say that this latest book was the worst. It was just a little too over the top, the situations were nearly implausible. Serena was a bit much with all the guys and usually I like her character but god in this book it was too much. The best part of the book was the ending with Blair and Nate. That was the one part I actually really enjoyed.Tiphanny the ferret girl...ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Hope the next book brings GG back to it's usual reading goodieness ;)"
5,Shipping,"Shipped on time, book was in new condition with the sticker price still on it, exactly as described."
5,A biography that will tempt you to pursue your dreams.,"I just finished reading ""Eleanor Roosevelt 1889-1934"" by Blanche Wiesner Cooke. The book reads like a novel, with the pulse of a newborn. Cooke writes in my opinion, an honest, biography of great depth (This ain't no Kitty Kelly). A sad little girl, in a dysfunction family (sound familiar) who becomes one of the worlds most notable people,if not women. The author captures the essence of Eleanor by sharing letters and page turning relationships. You will be introduced to a cast of characters second to none and feel as though you have stepped back in time. For those of you who are native New Yorkers you will be pleased to find an abandance of NYC history along with the the people who built the city and funded it from Henry Street Settlement to private industry. This book will broaden those who lack a political mind and maybe even educate you on the way. So get yourself a pot of tea and a good light. This book is long (500pp) but oh so neccessary."
3,"great life, ordinary biography","ER was certainly an impressive American. However this biography is too light for such a heavy weight. Wiesen Cook provides little analysis of the world between 1884 and 1933, just the occassional reference, yet the reason ER was so impressive was that she interpreted correctly and reacted positively to what was going on around her and her times. While the biographer provides so many extracts from her letters the reader feels like they are guiltity rummaging through another's most private possessions, she does not link these adequately to the times. Also, she is so enamoured with her subject that she frustratingly stops short of making a point or even stating her opinion or point of view on any interesting subject. Flowery prose is no substitute for pointed analysis, espeically in relation to a 20th century giant like ER."
5,A renewed appreciation for the power of political activism,"Although I am a product of the 1960's and 1970's, I have lost sight of the importance and power of activism in our culture. I once had a passion to fight for the rights of others less privilieged or for those who can not fight for themselves. This book stirred in me a passion that I have long forgotten! How great a woman was Eleanor Roosevelt! How important her contribution to human rights and the survival of the American way! Blanche Weisen Cook has written an account of Eleanor Roosevelt that is moving, realistic and powerful. It has renewed my interest in political causes and the incredible need for activism. A must read for women of all generations."
1,An unfortunate misinterpretation of a truly great woman,"Although Ms. Cooke's research is extensive, she does Eleanor Roosevelt no favors in interpreting her relationships by present day standards.The unforunate risk of taking a person out of the context of her background and the era in which she lived is a serious misrepresentation of that person's life. This is especially true when an author ventures so far out onto a limb as to present a relationship as having been sexual in nature. If wrong, as I believe Ms. Cooke is, not only has she misrepresented Mrs. Roosevelt's character; she has also forfeited a true understanding of the impact those friendships had on Eleanor Roosevelt's life and, ultimately, on the influence she had on the many lives she touched. This, in my view, is not only presumptuous;it is also inaccurate, irresponsible writing."
1,Miserably bad,"Eleanor Roosevelt is truly a fascinating character, but this book is absolutely painful to read. Cook makes references to topics before addressing them, makes characters difficult to follow, and generally botches what could be a great subject. Look elsewhere for Eleanor Roosevelt!"
1,How did this ever become a national bestseller?,"This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective. The research is suspect. The prose amateurish. The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work."
5,Know a drug using teen? Read this book--You can help!,"Of all the books I've read on the subject of teenagers and drug/alcohol abuse, this is by far the best. The authors clearly spell out exactly why you're right to be worried and how to help. They explain how to conduct an ""intervention"" to cut through the teen's denial that drugs/alcohol is a problem for her or him. By presenting treatment options and contracts as her or his ""choices,"" parents and others can also give up the sense of fear that leads to ineffectual efforts to control someone else's drinking or drug use. Once you let go and realize that--just as the teen you care about has a choice (including using)--you have a choice to impose consequences that range from mild to severe. The book is oddly reassuring and direct. A must-read for any parent or friend of a substance using teen."
4,Challenging!,"You should get this album if you are tired of music you only can listen to one time through, then be tired of it. The more you listen to the tracks on Bandit Lab, the more you like them! It is a good record!!"
2,Disappointing,From the title I would have expected some information about the innovative design details of these aircraft. Instead each chapter delivers a very superficial operational history and a list of the aircraft's varients. The drawings are profiles and the technical descriptions are basic lists of specifications. It would have been nice to see a description of how the state of the art was advanced by each of these aircraft. In summary this book has a misleading title and offers nothing new in the way of insights or information.
3,"Good songs, but all are duplicates from the Holiday and Christmas albums","The songs on this CD are all great classic Mitch Miller Christmas songs, but unfortunately every song on the CD came from either the ""Holiday Sing-Along with Mitch"" or ""Christmas Sing-Along with Mitch"" albums, which I already have. So, if this is the only Mitch Miller Christmas CD you will get, you'll like it, but if you already have the two I mentioned, you already have ALL the tracks on this CD! I was hoping it would be stuff I didn't already have, but I was disappointed."
5,for a student,"I bought this for a student, who loves the wizard and oz. He was super excited and loves the book."
1,Not color!,"This book is advertised as having the 24 color plates and all the two-color illustrations. That is not accurate. It has the pictures, but they are all black and white. Only the cover is color."
3,The wonderful wizard of oz,I must first say that I first read this book as an adult after many years of watching the movie. While I am glad that I finally read the book I have to say that for me the movie was much better.
5,So far great luck,I hate the wax rings so for the last few years I have been installing these-in my own homes-3 times. If you have to take the toilet off you will not have the big mess that wax makes. I wouldn't try to reuse one of these if it has been on a couple of years-go ahead and buy a new one.
1,Who Translated this Book!,"Can't decide whether to purchase this book because no translator is listed. Consulting the Everyman site is no help. They keep it a secret also. If it's Pevear and Volokhonsky I will pass. They have done more damage to Russian literature through their illiterate, clumsy, clunky, interlinear trots than Joseph Stalin."
4,This One Goes In the Suitcase,"There may be other travel books that offer glossier photos or more detailed restaurant reviews, but for historical perspective, interesting tidbits of information, and honest opinions it is hard to beat the Moon series of travel guides. The accommodations sections include many cottages and B&B's, which we prefer above hotels and condos. My Kauai book has gone on two trips with me; the last time it was the only one of five guidebooks to make it past the packing cut and into the suitcase."
1,crap,Cheap plastic. Poorly cut. Mounts outside window and sticks onto car with 3m foam tape. Looks like crap. Get the ones that mount inside the window and looks alot better.
4,Good replacement wiper blades,"Nothing spectacular, but a decent replacement blade I purchased for a good price. Fits a Nissan Maxima, 1998 just fine."
1,"Just peanut butter. Trust me, this is not the peanut butter inside of Reese's!!!","Very very sad, as I was hoping for a jar of that oh so tasty peanut butter inside of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. I am telling you this is just Skippy Peanut Butter with a Reese's label stuck on it. I had the whole family taste it at Christmas by asking them what it was, and they all said just peanut butter. I also then took regular peanut butter from the pantry, and put that on a plate with the Reese's. I then handed it out to 6 family members and asked them to identify what one was Reese's Peanut Butter and the Skippy. No one could tell the difference. I think either Reese's is either just scamming us to make money, or they don't want to put out the actual peanut butter in the cups, as we all would be eating that with chocolate rather than buying the cups. If they sold the actual peanut butter in the cups, I would be the first to buy a case!!!"
3,Novelty is where its at,"Tastes a lot like other peanut butters. However, this was a novelty gift for a friend and the Reese brand was lots of fun when involved with chocolate chips and people having fun."
1,cookie cutter,"This cookie cutter was alot smaller than I expected out to be. Because of this it made extremely small parts, especially the ears."
5,My favorite edition,"The first, second and this third edition are my favorites. I don't like the changes made in the fourth edition and don't care to hassle with it. I got sober with this one, have read and appreciated the first two. I'll stick with this one."
1,BAD,I am quite a fan of Bond music and I dont know what everyone else was listenig to but my wife and I thought this CD was horrible. Nothing even sounded like Bond themes and they were annoying. well that ought to do it.
5,ULTRA COOL !!!,"When I first popped this baby into the cd player I thought ""...heh, this really STINKS!!! These guys are WAY OUTTA TUNE!!!""...but I listened on, & caught on. This is ONE HELLUVA cd!!! I play this OFTEN, especially since I love Bond music ...THIS IS A GREAT WACKED-OUT JAZZY & FRESH!!! approach to music which if always listened to can become stale & static, if only by repetition. Buy this...enjoy..."
4,Interesting,"Sampling this CD, I thought that this would be the best album to date from this band. So I bought it. Indeed, the sound was bigger than any of the other albums, and the production was better.But what about the content? Well, to be honest, I thought it dragged a little bit. The first track ""Dr. Yes"" and the fourth track ""007"" were the highlights for me. They weren't too long, they grooved, and they were very exhilarating. ""007"" really was great, perhaps the tastiest 7/8 I have ever heard, though the horns were a bit much at times.Some of the songs were mediocre. ""This Never Happened"" and ""Teasing the Korean"" really began to bore me after a while.So, defintely not their best, but it's still listenable."
3,"Good starting place, not a great edition","Merle D'aubigne is a very enjoyable historian, but his work does not abridge well. One of his strengths is the ability to paint a picture of the time and place the events are happening. This volume, however, cuts most of that out. We learn a lot about Zwingli, but not a lot about Switzerland prior to the Reformation. We learn that Zwingli hated that the Swiss fought each other, but not why they were doing so or how deeply engrained the mercenary culture of the time was. I recommend this book for people who are looking for a quick survey of Zwingli's life, but not for people who are interested in in-depth study of the man.On the other hand, there are simply no good biographies of Zwingli out there. He (along with Cranmer) is one of the forgotten voices of the Reformation, so we ought to be grateful that anything is available at all, let alone something cheap and readable."
4,Pretty good,"This book is pretty good. It has photocopiable games at the back that I use fairly often. My only complaint about this book is that it isn't organized in a way that lets me find specific activities for practicing specific grammar points. It's organized by type of game (i.e. picture games, word games, acting, etc.) But all in all, it's pretty good"
4,Great for beginners,"So there I was at my first TESOL convention having almost completed my MA TESL/TEFL. I was literally salivating at the Cambridge book stall. Everything looked so great, but as a student you have limited funds. Suddenly an older woman walked up to me, recognized my bibliophile stupor and asked if I was a new teacher. I answered yes and she grabbed this title and ""Discussions That Work"" by Penny Ur. These two books have been invaluable in my teaching for the past five years. The activities are well organized and the explanations help as a springboard for my own ideas. As with all Cambridge series, the preference is British English, so if you are a purist, some activities are not readily available for American. I have found that my students don't usually notice the difference. All in all, this is the one book in my ESL library that I look in first when I am at a complete loss for what to do."
5,I bought it twice.,"I bought this book as a requirement for one of my college classes. As a foreign language and second language teacher, I referred to it often for ideas. I loaned it to another teacher who left the country without returning the book. I loved the book so much I bought it a second time. Now, I never loan this book to anyone."
1,nothing new,"I was very disappointed in this book. Like many of the books in the Cambridge series, it seemed a little dated. For anyone who lives in the US I think the cooperate learning series by Kagan is far superior and is easily adapted for ESL."
3,Excellent resource book for species of birds,"Rosemary Low, a premier British aviculturist, has written an excellent guide for breeders and bird fanciers about the species and subspecies of many types of psitticines with color photographs and descriptions to help identify them. There is information on their locale of origin and population in the wild. I believe her information on breeding histories of these birds is interesting and helpful for potential breeders of any of these birds. I do however, feel that her information on nutrition and feeding is dated. There has been so much discovered in more recent years on the nutritional requirements of birds, certain species in particular, that one should refer to more current reference materials for that information."
5,the misfit flick,"i just want to say hey to my buddy tyrone, kick @ss movie man, congrates with the release, im a big fan of the film."
1,Social Misfits,"This movie was an utter train wreck, sheer dog .... Low grade trash that will wallow in the unmarked grave of ...movie making. It made me long to watch Battlefield Earth twice. Words fail to describe the utter discust and waste of time this dreadful picture representces, itemize the contents of your trash can it will be time well spent if your other option is sitting through Social Misfits."
4,"This ""Rainbow"" will brighten your day!","""Rainbow Soup"" is terrific. I don't know what else to say. It's as interesting for kids as it is for adults. (My wife wants to figure out how to teach her class how to make ""stained glass"" windows, whereas I want to hear more from the Afro-Celt band). Art, music, literature, diversity of culture and history; I can't imagine a kid could watch this and not find at least one topic they'd like to explore further. ""Rainbow Soup"" does everything that a children's show should do, but which most--in point of fact--don't."
5,"Veves, Seals & Sigils","The only thing worthless is the previous review by the Santeria moron who does not like anyone messing with his belief system! With that said, this is an EXCELLENT book!!! It's practical and does not take any training to use. Brodsky spells out exactly what it takes to use the book properly and safely. I am ""not"" involved in Santeria in any way and yes I have used this book and gotten some awesome results!!If you approach the material in the book with all due respect and follow the instructions to the tee, you'll reap great rewards because the spiritual forces that these veves represent are interested in helping people outside their ""humble"" worshippers!Brodsky should be commended! I applaud him!"
2,A little help,"I've bought the book and done some spells, but they don't seem to be working. Could someone enlighten me on what I could be doing wrong? I followed the instructions. Is there supposed to be something that happens that tells me the spell was a success? Shoul d the wax cover your entire name during each signature you draw?"
4,There are some great stories in this book.,"If you want to see Hammett playing around with the boundaries of his genre, read this book. It is great to see him give us the hard-boiled western, for example. One of the tales provides a glimpse at Hammett's life in his late 50's; its a rather weird autobiographical fragment. The rest are tightly packed knockouts."
5,book,this book lets you know what is harmful to you and its great helps you decide whats not good for you
5,"Kerri, Grade 6","I think this book is hilarious. It tells about things that most girls face. The ""it girls"" ""The dork boy"" ""The period"" ""the push up bra"". Those kind of things. It may have some""content"" in it, but it's still a great book.THough sometimes I wonder why it was in my schools library..."
1,"Rip off of another, better novel","This book is a rip-off of Harriet the Spy, but with the ""diary"" being a blog. The fact that the author once worked for the same company that piloted the heavily ""borrowed"" and ""rewritten"" Opal Mehta Getting a Life book is of interesting note. What ever happened to the concept of fresh new ideas in YA books?"
2,Eh..,"Well, I'll have to admit, this book is funny. But, it was just so.. so airhead-y that I found I was more apt to laugh at Raisin's personality and stupidness and sertotypical teenager additude (I need a boyfriend, I need to go shopping, lyk OMG!-ness). Just out of seventh grade last year after moving from Maine to Oregon, I can assure most everyone that hardly any girl (and I pity those who are) is like this. Everyone was fine without a boyfriend and shopping and kissing hardly blipped on most people's radar. So, if you are looking for an insight to a teenager's life, skip this unless you are looking for over-the-top vulgarity (that whole Mervis issue? I'd be better off about knowing that...) and ridiculous obsessions."
1,Don't buy it!!!,"Please, don't buy it. Not only it is not well structured, but it contains not up-to-date content (some parts only apply to 8i) and a lot of miskakes as well!"
1,Oracle tuning?,"This is wasting of time and money one of the worst book about tuning i ever read. If you want get good knowledge about CBO please look on this book written by Jonathan Lewis: Cost-Based Oracle Fundamentals. The Oracle SQL Tuning & CBO Internals by Kimberly Floss is full of Oracle 10G Features with short descriptions which are worthless. And in the first section about CBO you can find few mistakes e.g. ""Histograms are only effective when used on indexed columns whose data is not uniformly distributed"". This book as others from rampant press have high price big letters and small value from the information point of view. I think this book should have name ""Oracle 10g New and Old Features in 5 senteces each""."
2,It was an excellent deal when it was <10 dollars,"Having purchased two ""sofa-sized,"" products for one sofa, at under ten dollars, they were an excellent purchase for the price. As prices have been exponentially growing for the same exact products this year it is easy to see why one would be unhappy with the size. With the economy in ""recovery,"" increasing prices without increasing quality seems a tad counter-productive."
2,TOO SMALL!,"This cover did not come close to fitting my sofa is was not long or wide enough. I will say the fabric is a good quality for 10 bucks. My suggestion is to buy 2, that way you can arrange them to fit a normal size sofa completely."
1,jacquard sofa throw,"this throw does not fit a regular size couch very good, it is too long lengthwise and widthwise is too short. The couch cover comes down from the back because it is not wide enough to cover the couch and when you sit on it, the back of the cover slips overtop of the sofa. Would not recommend this product"
2,Smells like oil,I am disappointed in the beige sofa slipcover. First of all I thought it would be fittet for a sofa but it is actually just a rectangle you can tuck in like a blanket. Second it has been out of the package for about an hour and I keep on smelling oil. I guess for $8.99 I can't complain too much:(
3,Protective Cover,"I would not call this the most stylish of slipcovers. However, very functional and protects the chair. I have pets, and wanted to keep hair off of chair. This works well. Plus, easy to clean."
5,WONDERFUL,THIS IS THE BEST THING FOR YOU SOFA IF YOU HAVE DOGS CATE OR KIDS IT STAYS CLEAN LONG ENOUGH AND IS VERY WASHABLE NEVER LOST ITS COLOR OR SIZE
4,great for the price,"The only thing about this is it's a bit smaller than what I expected. It doesn't quite cover our ugly floral couch, but you get what you pay for. Good for the price."
1,Better off using it on a futton.,We were better off using the sofa sized one on a futton than on our sofa. the THROW wouldnt stay in place for 5 minutes. the loveseat size wouldnt even properly cover my over stuffed chair. They are worthless unless you are planning on using the fabric for a diffrent purpose.Dont waste your money.
1,I hate it!,It's a piece junk. The color rubs off and stained my sofa and all over the clothes that I was wearing. The size was too small. No washing instruction label included. The frabic was rough and discomfor. This item should never puts out in the market.
3,Great gift for person who has no heart.,"I gave this to a person that is high on self-centeredness and low on having a heart, and it got the message across."
2,such a nice start.,"the book took an easy out, all around. it was a very easy read. the story was very easy without real conflict or struggle. the main character is always magically rescued. she wants the house but hasn't the money; oh well that's okay her foster mother has been pursuing a lawsuit over the twins death and guess what? the other party is offering to settle. there is the predictable scene with the stalker girlfriend; all cleared up after exchanging three sentences with her boyfriend.(oh, I'm so ashamed I could ever doubt you) the intriguing ghost angle--dropped without being used. All interesting lines in the plot were quickly dropped in favor of a happy, happy, ending. Gee. just like real life. I know some people like that sort of happy sweet perfect ending after no conflict, but I was so disappointed after all the good reviews. if the author could just have made the book so much as fifty more pages and actually had something happen to the characters it would be so worth reading."
5,A Consummate Page Turner,"Janie Shoup's story so touched my heart I bought it for all my girl friends for Christmas. It will make you laugh, cry, dare to hope, discover you can believe again, and wish the story wouldn't end. It transports you through a vast range of emotions, reveals the histories of generations, transcends time and makes you want to fall in love. A sublime read...literary utopia!"
4,"Good, but not great","Nice napkins. The only trouble is after use and washing, you'll need to iron them if you want nice crisp napkins. I bought enough that I will use the washed one for everyday, and save the new ones for company."
3,Definitely worth watching,"For what it's worth Leonard Maltin is very critical of this film and only gives it 1 1/2 stars. I thoroughly disagree. While it is not Academy Award material I believe any western or Lee Marvin fan will enjoy it. It also has creditable acting roles by Ron Howard, Gary Grimes, & Charles Martin Smith. The 3 latter actors play teen boys who are close friends. They find the Marvin character suffering from gunshot wounds resulting from an attempted robbery. The boys help him hide and feed him while he heals. They subsequently run away from home and are lured into crime by Marvin. This makes an interesting story that kept my attention. I also liked the sets (filmed in Spain) and photography. Using Maltin's four star system I would rate it 2 1/2 stars and you can see here that I gave it 3 stars of possible five. Again, I think any Lee Marvin or western film fan should see this. It is on the Encore Western Channel periodically."
1,I was sent the wrong item by an independent seller. I returned it.,It is likely that you will not be able to find this watch. I thought I got so lucky to be able to buy one.The style is gorgeous but this watch is so old now. They aren't making them any more.I was sold another watch under false pretenses (pretending to be this watch) so my experience with THIS LISTING has been wholly unpleasant. I'm sure the actual product is fine but good luck finding one.
1,Dont Wate Your Money,"Not to sure about the other review on this item. My guess is its probably a friend of the authors. This Press Release Toolkit consists of a few audio CDs and a forms type disk which is connected to the internet. CDs are homemade and terrible sound quality. They actually only play in 1 of our 2 cars because they are labeled with paper laminates. The content is about as good as the audio (bad). Overall a very poorly put together, cheap product. Im very surprised Amazon even sells this because most of the other stuff I purchase here is of decent quality."
1,the star of the film is not jacki chan!!!!,the film is fake on the picture you see jacki chan but not in the film.the fighting is a realy bad comparing to the part1.waste of money and time
5,Rock epitomized,"Springsteen really faltered once he ""made it"" with Born in the USA (and on.) But he was ruled in the 70's, and Born to Run was not only his, but rock's crown achievement. If an alien was to land and inquire, ""what is rock 'n roll,"" Born to Run would suffice as an answer. Sringsteen even leaves Dylan in the dust on this one; I can't think of a more powerful artistic portrayal of the great potential of that youthful need to break free of everything we all end up being anyway. Thunder Road is simply the finest, most powerful, most beautiful song ever written. There are a few things one needs in life to function: a copy of Kerouac's On the Road, the libraries of Hendrix, Joplin and Morrison, and, of course, Born to Run. Everything else is just icing on the damn cake."
5,Goosebumps...,"I used to listen to this album back in high school, while getting ready to go out on Friday nights. Twenty years later, ""Night"" still gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. If you know Bruce from ""Born in the USA"" & what comes later, you owe it to yourself to listen to ""Born to Run"", and ""The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle"""
5,Born to Run is exemplary!!!,"I loved ""Born to Run"" more than I ever dreamed possible when I recieved it as a Christmas gift this year! I knew ""Born to Run"" and ""Thunder Road"" from his ""Greatest Hits"" collection, but had yet to hear the rockin ""10th Ave. Freeze Out"", ""Backstreets"", ""She's the One"", ""Night"", Meeting Accross the River"" or the majestic, amazing, ""Jungleland"". It was love at first listen for me! I love every single song on this essential rock classic, and any Springsteen or music fan will love all of the energy, heart, and soul that Bruce and the band give this glorious record! I am amazed every time I hear it! You need to hear these 8 rock classics to really call yourself a music fan!"
5,Good good stuff.,"This is some of the all time funkiest rock and roll. Practically nothing beats the funk of 70's Springsteen and the E Street Band. If you do not like funk, do not buy this album. If you don't like music that's so good it hurts to listen to, don't buy this album.The instrumentals and the lyrics are amazing..."
5,Classic!,"Born to Run ranks, IMO, just behind Born in the USA and Darkness on the Edge of Town as The Boss's best work. You can't beat songs like Born to Run or Thunder Road, which are still popular to this day. Night, Backstreets, and Tenth Avenue Freeze Out are great songs in their own right. Don't forget Jungleland, with that violin opening that makes it a unique song in Springsteen's work.I recommend this album if you're just getting into Bruce Springsteen's music. Also, check out Born in the USA and Darkness on the Edge of Town."
4,Lived up to expectations,"The Item arrived,quicker than I expected,and,was in better condition,than I expected. It play's well.It completed a collection,of mine. I could not have wanted more,for the money I paid."
5,The best album ever made,"Okay so maybe my Springsteen bias is showing, and those in the ""Sgt. Pepper,"" ""Pet Sounds,"" ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" and ""Rumours"" camps will all have valid arguments, but the list is a small one.This was the true definition of the ""wall of sound."" Each song taking the listener on a journey. All one needs to do is close their eyes when listening and listen to the expressive music and lyrics of each song and you can almost picture yourself there...the hope and desperation still bleed through.Those who may not know the Springsteen catalog well...give it a listen. Chances are you have heard every song on the album played on the radio. That and there is no better opening song on any album than ""Thunder Road"" I think it is his finest composition."
5,Not just a great album but collection of 8 epic songs,This classic masterpiece from Bruce Springsteen is one of the greatest rock n roll albums ever recorded. That's not even debatable. Just buy the album if you want to listen to some of the greatest american music ever created.
4,One of the best complete albums ever.,I always liked the music but it wasn't until I read the lyrics for this album that I really began to appreciate Bruce for the great poet that he is.
5,One for the ages,"Springsteen put it all together here and the E Street Band came into their own with this effort. It was the first album from producer/manager Jon Landau and he helped immensely with the orchestration. From Roy Bittan's piano intro on ""Jungleland"" to the Bo Diddley beat of ""She's the One"" to the opening harmonica of ""Thunder Road,"" this is a tribute to Springsteen's exquisite vision. One of the top 5 rock 'n' roll albums of all time."
2,Boring,"Never was a big Springsteen fan, never will be. He can't sing, his music is boring. I shouldn't say all though I do like Thunderoad, that's it though, still a snoozer to me. Sorry Bruce, no sympathy here, and don't see the big rave on the 30th aniversary edition."
2,Failing the test of time?,"Time can be a cruel mistress, indeed. Lyrically, these cuts remain vital. I'm not sure the same can be said for ""the wall of sound"" music, however. ""Best Rock Album of All Time""? In its day, perhaps, but that day has passed. Though not nearly as highly praised, Springsteen's ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"" will, I believe, provide a more lasting legacy of his undeniable talent."
1,Unreal,"I have been amazed by Bruce Springsteen's popularity ever since I purchased this album amidst all of the hype that swirled around him. Let's critique Bruce and the E. Street band:Has anyone ever heard Steve Van Zandt's guitar? I love him in the Soprano's and his cool radio gig, but he might as well not even plug in. The whole band sounds like Meat Loaf - Bat Out Of Hell. Overproduced, mini operas tied together by a piano. The big man plays the same solo over and over. Bruce's voice is not what I would call a pretty thing to listen to either. Very limited vocal range. He screams more than he sings. I must be in the minority, but this sounds to me like corporate rock at its worst, heck, I would much rather listen to Southside Johnny or even Bon Jovi over this stuff."
2,Was this really a big album?,"I decided to venture beyond the artists I usually listen to (U2, Nicki Minage, alternative, etc.) So I picked up Born to Run thinking that this was a slice of true americana that certainly would not disappoint. I was wrong. This album was literally hurtful to my ears. I put it on in the car and my wife immediately turned it down and said ""who the hell is this?"""
5,Springsteen at his best,"I had heard the song ""Born To Run"" for the first time ,after buying the greatest hits album of the boss ,a year ago. Instantly, I realized it was one of the best I've ever listened to. It kept playing in my head for days, so I decided I'd better go and buy the whole ""ancient"" album.And so I did. Ever since ,this is one of my all times favorites CDs. I listen to the songs as often as once a week ,not wanting to really stop. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to get to know a great performer, composer and writer.All of my matured years I've yearned to discover new superb songs and singers . My revelation of Bruce Springsteen music is one of my best self-discoveries yet."
5,Born to run is Born to RULE,"My life was changed because of this album. When I heard Backstreets as a teenager from Jersey, I heard raw emotion that resonated with me. When Bruce says, ""Blame it on the lies that killed us/ on the truth that ran us down/ you can blame it all on me, Terry, it don't matter to me now/ when the break down hit at midnight there was nothing left to say/except I hated him/ and I hated you when you went away..."" no one can deny the power his words would have on a kid looking for connections. Bruce spoke to us as teenagers then, and as he matures, his lyrics remain vital, relevant, and inspirational today. Bruce is a modern day poet who will be remembered in anthologies in the 21st century and beyond.Dan Loughran"
5,Springsteen 101 Class Begins Here,"This is the starting point for listening to Bruce Springsteen. If you don't get it listening to this album, you won't ever get it. Born to Run is also an essential part of any music listener's collection, and may be the best rock album ever. It is certainly Springsteen's best.This is a special album, the one you remember vividly where you were and what you were doing the first time you heard it. The journey starts with Thunder Road -- a simple harmonica underscoring a humble offer to leave the past behind -- and rises to the thundering epic finale of Jungleland. More than 30 years after its recording, Born to Run continues to evoke new imagery and emotion."
5,Show a little faith there's magic in the night...,"Not a huge Bruce fan. Moreso because i was born in 1986 and the only songs i ever really heard of him was all of his new stuff, and some of the overplayed songs that came off his ""landmark"" recording Born In The USA. To me, he hit his stride early with this amazing album. With a song like THUNDER ROAD, how can it not be amazing, the title in itself blows you away. The title track is amazing, as is more or less every other track here. Honestly if you are questioning if getting into Bruce is worth your time, don't bank on Born in the USA to change your mind. Look back at Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town. These are the albums that will move you, and my guess is that the songs on USA already make you sick and if they don't listen to classic rock radio for a day or two and then they will. Just my opinion"
5,Music History,This is simply one of the best 30 years after its release. I rarely like or listen to every song on an album/CD but this one I can play over and over again. The writing (words and music) the arrangements and the sound are simply not matched. A mix of words and music and sound not to be equalled. As another review stated this is a landmark in music and put the Springsteen name in lights forever.
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,Bruce and E-Street at the absolute top of their game! Ignore the 1-star fool who spouted off a few reviews back - he hasn't a clue about great music - or about American values either.
5,Hands down the All-Time Greatest Rock Album Ever,"Absolutely every song on the album is excellent, even Meeting Across the River, which is probably the weakest, is great. Night and Backstreets both have great lyrics. She's the One and Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out are very original. Thunder Road, Born to Run and Jungleland are with out a doubt the best songs on the album. I probalbly listen to Jungleland the most.Anyone who likes Bruce Springsteen (and Rock music)and doesn't own this album should certinly purchase it right away. I really doubt anyone who owns this album regrets buying it."
5,I thought this was a forum to review music??,"Not that I think that many people will give much attention to the one star reviewer (attention that he/she so desperately craves) - but a couple facts need to be stated. First off, this is supposed to be a forum to review music, not the politics of the artist, isn't it? Second, BTR is a bona fide classic (like you don't already know?) and would remain so even if Bruce *HAD* committed a heinous crime/act, other than disagreeing with a Republican."
2,Stars for the art and style only,"I'm a huge fan of kung fu comics. I love the bigger than life styles, the way moves flow from panel to panel and the artwork in general. From a looks perspective, this comic doesn't disappoint. However, the storyline is truly wretched. Kung fu comics don't have the deepest plots, but even no plot would be worse than this BAD plot. The writing is awful, there are huge plot holes and the characters have the maturity of 3 year olds. If you want to read a much better comic, read The Storm Riders."
2,Tacky and pointless!,"This movie was barely above atrocious. The movie is based on a play by Christopher Marlowe. The play, Edward II, is very good! This movie does not do it justice. It is very tacky and poorly made. The first thing a viewer is forced to watch is an unnecessary love scene between two men. The movie itself is not set in any one time period. It is confusing to try and figure out where the characters are, or when they are. The acting is terrible as well. It is more like a soap opera then a movie based on a great literary accomplishment."
2,Don't get this one...,Don't get this t.v. It will be unuseable in 2 years when the government officialy switches to digital.
4,Great Songs,"First off, this cd has wonderful songs! The reason many Athenaeum fans aren't crazy about this cd, is due to the fact that this cd is very produced. By produced I mean that I took Athenaeum around two years of hard work and much much studio work to complete this. IN RESPONSE to people stating ""these songs have been available for download,"" who cares? Downloading music illegaly is guess what? Illegal, so that should NEVER be a reason not to purchase a cd. Second, while most of these songs were available for download prior to the release of the album, they were only demo versions, meaning that the cd versions sound about 10 times better. Totally different in many cases.Buy this album, buy Radiance, buy Hourglass, and watch for new material from the guys. They have changed line-ups, and have re-discovered a passion for writing quality music. Very good new stuff. Watch out!"
3,Terribly Average.,"What a disappointment. The first CD was incredible - one of the greatest pop albums of the 90's, a soundtrack to my college years. This one will collect dust on my shelf. Not a terrible album, but uninspired and banal. I give it three stars with hopes that Athenaeum will get their stuff together and write some better music for the next release."
4,Tread carefully in Spider's world,"This is a compelling and disturbing little book that leaves the reader with a truly distorted sense of reality. Spider's world is tormented and confused, a very unpleasant place to be. The narrative shifts between the present and Spider's tortured childhood, but all is not as it appears or is it? Is Spider's reality the one we should ultimately believe? You'll just have to pick this one up and decide for yourself."
1,'To be awake is to be available to torment' -McGrath.,"The quote above accurately reflects my feelings about this book, for McGrath put me to sleep on more than one occasion.I can't decide which was worse: the listless, rambling descriptions (often of the most trivial details) or the dialogue, which came like bread heels -- stale and far apart. The miserable tedium of the entire novel can be avoided by reading the succinct little synopsis on the back cover: boy kills mother by mistake, blames father, is institutionalized, and becomes ever more delusional; this summary literally explains it all, and its brevity is highly preferable to the novel itself.A completely unremarkable and maddeningly pointless foray into ... madness."
3,ol' dirty London,"This novel has atmosphere aplenty; fog, gasworks, mysterious noise in the attic, polluted canels, etc - but despite all the critical acclaim for this little novel of madness, I had a hard time engaging with this narrative. Told in flashback - this tale of a young lad going mad - the novel paints a facinating portrait of London between the wars. But I had trouble staying with Spider's hallacinations and imaginings. And as that is what seems to have engaged so many of this books fans, I finished it disappointed. I can understand what attracted David Cronenberg to direct the adaptation of this book to film, as so many of his films are about male fear of female sexuality - and this novel has more of that than fog."
4,Kindle Edition is in German,"This book is quite good if you like creepy, which I do, but be aware that this Kindle edition, published by Berlin Verlag, is in German, not English as is stated in the book details. I've not been able to find a Kindle edition in English."
3,Living in the head of a schizophrenic,"I'm not sure if I really enjoyed this book, or was just fascinated by it's ability to make up close and personal the pain and terror a schizophrenic must go through. Even though it is morbidly fascinating much of the time and I was drawn to the story, I would have liked a little something else in the mix along with the protagonist's rambling tormented thoughts."
4,Greatest Hits,I am very happy with my purchase of this CD. I am a big collector of Greatest Hits and adding this one to my collection is just a bonus especially if you enjoy the 90's alternative rock genre.I highly recommend it.
4,Overdue Compilation,"I'd been dyin' for a collection of Collective Soul's rock songs for awhile. Why they do anything outside of mainstream rock is beyond me. ""Heavy"" is based on a super-charged Aerosmith riff and is far better than anything that band has done recently. Their grunge-lite hit ""Shine"" still sounds fresh, removed from its era. Later songs, like ""Precious Declaration"" and the brand new ""Next Homecoming"" sound like singer/guitarist Ed Roland has been listening to latter day Queensryche to beef up his already rock solid riffs. The bad part about this record is it makes me wonder that much more why CS doesn't flat out rock all the time. They do it well."
5,Great Collection for Collective Soul Fans.,Has my favorites all on one CD. Love it. These songs just never get old. Got the album on one of amazon's sales so I couldn't ask for anything more.
5,A must for any Collective Soul Fan,"Having followed Collective Soul from their very first album Hints and Allegations this collection is a great span of the bands hits. Collective Soul are the masters of catchy riffs and each song on this album is great. The two ""new tracks"" are very infectious and give us an idea of what they offer fans in the 2004 release Youth."
3,Who decides what to put on a greatest hits cd?,"This is not the first time that the music industry has put out a cd of ""greatest hits"" and had no real clue of what they were doing. I'm not sure who's in charge of deciding what to put on a greatest hits cd, but they really should poll the fans for a better idea of what to put on there.Good songs that were included on this cd are:HeavyShineEnergy (new one)RunGelPrecious DeclarationWhy Pt. 2The World I KnowListenDecemberSongs that were completely left off for reasons unknown to any Collective Soul fan:BlameWhere The River FlowsMaybeSimplePerfect DayVentBoastGenerateIf you're looking for a greatest hits of Collective Soul I would suggest that you purchase individual songs from Napster or iTunes or whatever and create your own compilation. The price will be about the same and the quality of the compilation will be much better. The only reason it gets a 3 star vote is that it's Collective Soul and I can't give them anything less."
4,Collective Soul,"This cd will bring back memories. It has everything I ever liked by Collective Soul. There are a few songs on there that don't really belong, but they only had so many hits. If you're a Collective Soul fan, it's worth buying."
5,Collective Soul is a great original rock band of the 90s,"This is a great CD. It has Collective Soul's best hits. This was a great band from the 90s with an original sound. I also purchased their live DVD with Atlanta Symphony orchestra, which is very high quality and worth having. Ed Roland is a terrific artist with amazing songwriting skills and a charismatic frontman for this band. This CD is very much worth having."
2,Disapointment,The quality of this CD was very poor. The lyrics can not be understood because the music overrides it. The mixing is very poor. I would not recommend to any one.
5,Very good,"This CD is the indeed the best of Collective Soul. From the fist track to track 13 you are consumed with the music that is on the CD. Highly Reccomended for any Collective Sould fan, and anyone who isn't a Collective soul fan."
5,Perfect,Perfect greatest hits album.... Something new putting unreleased tracks on a hits album which I think is a great idea. Collective Soul is one of the best bands of the 90's and have been underrated for their work. Another great album to add to the CS collection.
5,A Must Have For Any Collective Soul Fan,"This is an amazing compilation of greatest hits from one of the best bands to come out in the last ten (or should I say seven)years. Ed Roland is an exceptional muscician and songwriter. For fans who already own most of their work, you will love having this compilation on one cd with two new songs (especially Energy) and for those who are new to Collective Soul, you will be pleasantly surprised at all the cool songs you already recognize from radio play and will realize that you are already a fan."
5,collective soul rocks!,"it is one of their best albums yet! i love the album ""dosage"" too! (...). my dad has been playing collective soul to me since i was five years old. you must buy the album! it is awsome!"
3,"3.5 stars. Alot missing, atleast in my opinion.","Collective Soul may be one of the top 5 real rock n roll bands from the 90's. They got great tunes, great playing and great writings. When I checked the track listing on this one before purchasing it when it came out I realized some of my favorites like 'Maybe' for instinct was missing and many more, yet I got the album because it's still the avergae greatest hits, not the best but 'ok'.Now if you really wanna get into them better off in purchasing all studio albums. Would of wished if they could of waited a bit longer for this release or added more tracks and why not a double cd for any b sides or extra trackings (Rare ones are so typical nowadays).No worries, you won;t be disapointed!"
1,Disappointed,"I had only heard one song by CS and really liked it, December. There is nothing even close to the sound and feel of that song on the rest of this boring album. I don't understand what anybody is raving about if this is the best CS can produce. To those expecting adult/progressive/alternative: forget it! This is pure made-for-the-masses commercial junk food. Give me chance to unload this turkey to someone that can appreciate."
5,Great Sound! Very Cohesive Track Selections and Arrangements!,"This is a very good best of compilation because the sound quality is excellent, the track selections are great and the way that they are arranged makes for very cohesive and flowing listening as if this was a normal album and not the collection of hits that it is. Collective Soul may not have received the due recognition it deserves as a great band of musicians and songwriters in this current climate of rap and pop drivel but something tells me they will be back when the next wave comes around. Very good representation of what CS was all about and you can't go wrong if you are looking to discover them with this disc. Highly recommended."
2,Dramas at the hospital...,"All of us have passed through the medical system at one point or another. Ram Oren is trying to show us what's going on behind the scenes.Taking his ideas form the news of the time in Israel involving some hospital corruptions, this book is pure fluff - easy to pass time with, but nothing more."
3,Too thick!,"It has a good grip and a good finish.The delivery was very fast.Does not fit in my Koni Coilover kit, there is no enough room for it to fit in between the car frame and the coilover adjustment nut."
4,Solid tool,"I haven't tried it yet but by the way it looks this is a solid tool; I don't have any doubts. I will come back with comments if it is disappointing me.The joint is very solid and looking like it will support a ton of torque.The tool I received has the jaw secured by a spring pin and not by the hex screw seen in the picture, which is better in my opinion, as the pin is recessed flush with the tool surface instead of taking space on the side of the tool which can interfere with your available clearance.However, for a hunk of steel, I feel that these tools can be a little less expensive. Really."
3,This Author Can Do Better,"This was the follow up to the Eagle Has Landed. I wish he had not tried so hard to get my hard earned dollars and spent more time working on this story. I fell into it thinking it would be as good as the first and came away disappointed. I also think he has put out much better books and this one was the first to really disappoint me. The book is just an average book. This book seams rushed, almost like the author did not want to take the time to really develop either the story or the characters. Because of the light development it does not hold your attention. Overall it is just an average, light World War Two action novel that does not do him credit."
3,So-So Sequel,"Higgins brings back Steiner and Devlin in a plot very similar to the original, The Eagle Has Landed. There is still some magic but it is not as taut as the original. The only intrigue is what will happen at the end if the new mission is successful, basically who will pay for misdeeds, and that is explained rather unenthusiastically. Basically, Devlin is up to his old charming tricks and Steiner is present with ramrod professionalism. More for rabid fans of Higgins and these particular characters - still fun though."
4,The Eagle Has Flown by Jack Higgins,"Excellent follow-up to the novel ""The Eagle Has Landed"" by Higgins. It's the usual World War II yarn written by the master himself. The twists and turns, throughout the novel, make this book a page turner.Eamonn Grant"
2,terrible mixes,"This has to be one of the worst CD Maxi single Madonna has release by far. The Man With the Guitar mix is horrible. None of the remixes like the PSB(PetShopBoys) remix & Paul Oakenfold remix have any diva house, big room, progressive/trance, circuit, disco modern,or peak hour sound. Just terrible. All the remixes are under 7 minutes. The PSB & Paul Oakenfold are really just dubs that sound like an early AM club mix. Something a club would play at 6 am in the morning while people r coming down from drugs. The Paul Oakenfold is very repetitious with ""i heard it all before"" vocals throughout with hardly any verses song or chorus song. I have to say the album version Sorry is by far the best track on this maxi single. This single doesn't have the Let it Be Here remix Vocal Edit like on the 2track import single of Sorry."
1,I guess Madgeepoop is a has-been,"I can't believe Madgeepoop is a fool. The Last 5 star reviewer is ridiculous and he doesn't know what a wop is a slang for. Anyhow, this song does stink. Avoid this dog like a plague and go for The Best of The Tijuana Toads instead."
1,The worst song of recent times,Madonna is one of the worst singers after Britney Spears and Ashlee simpson.Sorry is as bet as a song can get.BUY THIS AND BE PREPARED TO BE TREATED LIKE AN OUTCAST AND LOSER.DONT AND I MEAN DONT BUY OR LISTEN TO IT.
4,Good Quality Cover,"I bought this cover for my 2000 S-10 and I'm quite pleased with it. I needed it to cover my wheel as the bottom was rubbing away so this not only protects my wheel but it also looks nice. The original wheel/ interior is grey, so this doesn't clash much. The yellow bow-ties clash a little, but they make sense.I would've given this five stars if it weren't for fit and build quality. The fit was pretty tight, but I imagine that's normal of all wheel covers. On the positive side it does grip the wheel very well so I'm not worried about my grip on the wheel. The build quality was fine, but there were a couple of loose threads and it didn't feel as if there was much care in where the stitching ended up. Still a good quality product, just not 5-star worthy."
4,Great Value,"Nice for the price. I wish the chevy symbol was a little 3-d and more color to it. Overall, for the price it looks great."
1,This film bit the big one!,"This is one of the worst in a long line of terrible Chuck Norris films. If you liked the Missing in Action series or maybe the Original Delta Force, don't waste your time with this one. If you're thrilled with the fabulous storylines of Forest Warrior and Top Dog then by all means waste your hard earned money on this movie. There was a reason this film was shelved for two years before it went straight to video, IT SUCKED!!!"
3,THE NIGHTMARE HAS JUST BEGUN,The savage sequal to first demonic film where this time an evil asylum doctor feeds his paients to a goulish skinless coarpse who is this demon wach the first hellraiser for the answer. the evil doctor in a sick demented way falls in love with the coarpse but in the end ...? watch and find out if you dare
2,Chuck vs the devil?,"Ive seen alot of norris movies and this one was really out there. The main villian is Chris Neame, he appeared on a few macgyver episodes in goofy roles, so when i saw him in here, the movie became comical to me. Esp his goofy eyes, and at one point i thought his contacts were in wrong. He looked retarded. Chuck's sidekick was an annoying black guy, who constantly complained bout food and the heat. I give this 2 stars. It was watchable, but neame in a bad guy role? Watch his macgyver roles and youll see what I mean. Besides, norris owned him. Even satan cant defeat Chuck!"
3,"Often silly, very gory, never scary...","Maybe a three-star is being too nice, but I did kind of like this film. The special effects are good for its time and the story is somewhat interesting, but it's just not that memorable. Pinhead and the Cenobites return to wreak havoc on a mental hospital. Sort of like ""Nightmare on Elm Street 3"" only with Pinhead and instead of preadolescent kids it's, well, adolescent kids. Some neat visuals make this film an interesting watch, but it doesn't do much in the scares department."
