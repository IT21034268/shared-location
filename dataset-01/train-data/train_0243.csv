3,I have a feeling this is not all,"I only know Gould through his recordings, so I looked forward to this film to tell me what he was like. It sort of does. I only object to the interviews with fans, which are very boring, indeed. Several are shot at length discussing how they worship Gould. Enough of that. There is quite a lot of footage of Gould at the keyboard, swaying in circles and humming to himself. Way too much of that is here and should have been cut. I was surprised at how much early footage apparently exists of Gould from the early 50s and beyond. I would have enjoyed more of that, since he was in his prime then. We really learn nothing about his personal life, either, zilch. Nor do we find out how and why he died at age 50. Finally, the film is probably a little too reverential for its own good."
5,A wonderful story and the Audiobook is amazing.,"This story is wonderful but the audiobook is amazing. My children, age 5 and 6, have listened to this audiobook 7 times (it is over 6 hours long) in just a few weeks of having it from the library. My daughter now wants her own copy. They love the mystery and thought of an older, different time. Suzette is a strong heroine and so interesting to learn about."
5,educational,"One of the educational points that I really appreciate about this novel is the attention that the author, Kathleen Ernst, pay to the technology of the time period. Canoes and decorating techniques are described, including paintings on canoes and decoration of garments. My daughter and I were intrigued by the description of how the grandmother and mother went about the task of ""packing up"" their house when it was time to move.The book introduces simple French and Ojibwe vocabulary that is either basic (merci) or relevant to the subject matter (wiigwam), and a glossary with pronunciation guide is included."
3,Funky but entertaining,Picture quality is good and film location is good and not bad story line. The casle and the two girls are especially fun.
1,"Cheesy, sleezy low grade B Movie","OK, I only gave it 1 star, but I watched over an hour of it before I gave up. It's just a bit of sexploitation, but as a sexploitation film, it does the job."
2,Not for the older core 2 duo either.....,"This is my second Speck case, as I loved my first one. I dropped my 15 inch mac book pro and that case broke (better than my mac book). Anyway, the peripheral slots on the left side are perfect, but not on the right side. Since I don't use the peripheral slots on the right, it's not a big deal, but if I do need to use them, I'd have to take the case off. I purchased it for $20.00, so I'm ok with it, but if/when I do use the peripherals on the right side, I won't be happy. I'm very happy with the red color...my last one was green and I liked that as well."
5,Very Good Book,The book was a pioneering document as it details the struggles and strength of a woman at the turn of the Twentieth Century. It historically chronicles some of the major spiritual and religious concerns and does not discount women's strength and ability to hold to values prior to being allowed to vote.
3,nothin' special,"Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but this is nothin' special. If I take it out of the drawer and try to use it there is no difference than any other scoop. I have not put it in the dishwasher either. I usually have to run it under warm water and then use it, which is what I used to do with my other scoop. So, basically no big deal here."
5,Astrobiology...,"Life Beyond the Universe is a good text for teaching the concept of life beyond Earth. It integrates the primary sciences of Astronomy, Geology, and Biology. I like the way it is set up in general as it incorporates many of the concepts of learning.While it was created for a college course, I have used it for teaching Juniors and Seniors in High school. The first edition is too outdated. And the 3rd edition was beyond my budget. The second edition has changes from the first that I prefered. Over all, it is a good first text for astrobiology."
5,Seems to be a great book ....,....the book was purchased for a class I unfortunately ended up dropping for the semester. The portions that I did read through seemed to be well written and informative.
2,below average,"Basically, you get for what you paid for: a cheap webcam. Here are the things that I found out:1. XP Drivers are provided, but they aren't XP certified.2. L shape piece felt cheap. It is hard to make it stable on the top of my laptop. Using the taped clip probably improves the stability, if you don't care about having the clip permanently attached on your laptop.3. Some of the software came with the package don't install under XP.4. Performance is bad, comparing to other webcams, and quality is so-so. Even at the highest frame rate, you still see the ""fast-moving"" object effect.Overall, it is a cheap webcam, so don't expect too much."
1,Resolution is 352x288 and NOT 640x480 as stated,"This product is misrepresented as a 640x480 resolution camera when in fact the packaging says 352x288.This may be a good camera - but if you are looking for a 640x480, this is NOT it."
5,WEBCAM,"THIS WEBCAM.. MICRO INNOVATIONS IC400C, IS A GREAT WEBCAM TO OWN. THE WEB PICTURE IS VERY CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE IT WITH MY WINDOWS XP."
2,Disappointing,"A few breathing exercises were OK, but not much instruction on developing a good practice. Most of the book explaining Taoist water and fire methods put me to sleep. Was like New Age goobly guk."
3,Good book,"All in all this is a good book. The matter is neatly presented and there is some interesting stuff about the fire and water taoist meditation. However, I think that this book doesn't present much information nor it delivers knowledge that is not present elsewhere. This book tastes like ... re-fried beans to me.Frantzis' ""Opening the energy gates of your body"" remains his unsurpassed masterpiece. If I had to save one single book about Chi, the ""Gates"" would be it."
5,relaxing,"I found ""Relaxing Into Your Being"" very helpful. There is a set of breathing exercises that helped me relax physically and mentally. I see the world from a more relaxed point of view. In the appendix, there is a good description of the physical process of relaxation.Also, there is a very interesting and informative description of meditation."
4,Frantzis and meditation,"Taoism is a religion (or philosophy, depending how you look at it) that requires practice. Frantzis elegantly explains some of the more complicated concepts within taoist thought, but where he truly excels is in his presentation of the water method's exercises. He offers a systematic approach that offers you enough thorough information to learn basic meditation skills safely by yourself.As a companion piece to his ""Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body,"" ""Relaxing Into Your Being"" also provides a solid (yet safely basic) core of chi gung practices. Frantzis and his water method provide the only chi gung I would ever dare to learn from a book, and it is because of a combination of his explicit instruction and the gentle nature of the water method that this is so.Beware: Frantzis is disparaging towards other systems, and he often shows them in their worst light. Take it with a grain of salt, and learn what he has to offer-- it is definitely worth your time."
1,Why?,"More and more frequently I am observing that AMAZON is advertising/displaying videos that are ""Unavailable."" Why? If AMAZON does not carry the product, please remove it from the catalog of listings.I cannot rate this product since I have been unable to view/purchase it."
4,Intriguing. Suspenseful. Tantalizing. Satisfying.,"Chief Inspector Morse is a curmudgeon. He is an aging, irritable bachelor with a keen sense of smell for murder. Just the right character to solve this mystery. Layer upon layer of lies, deception, and intrigue shield the truth from the casual observer.Parnell confesses to five murders but had comitted only four. It takes a death bed recantation to spur the police into action. Even then, only Morse has the perseverance to follow the thin trail of evidence to its conclusion. A ""closed case"" suddenly opens into a profound mystery worthy of the talents of DCI Morse.Well-acted, beautifully filmed, and with typically understated British humor, ""A Walk Through the Woods"" is very engaging and enjoyable."
4,You`re missing something.,"Just because a cd gets four instead of five stars doesn`t mean it`s a less than rad cd. This was in my cd player a week nonstop when I first got it, and it finds it`s way back in there quite often. Not as much as Day the Sun Went Out though. If you`re new to BSF, pick that one up off Initial Records. Then you`ll understand why this one gets four. The production`s a lot more professional with their move to Victory. They also pretty much stayed away from their beautiful, ""emo"" songs, throwing much-harder core into their studio sound (My Life in the Knife Trade excluded). But no production can ever do BSF justice. I guess I can put it this way: after I first heard their cd four years ago, I liked them alot; but after I saw them live, they were my favorite band. Their shows have an element of intensity and energy that nothing can match. If you like the cd`s, great...but get off the couch and go to a show."
5,The best BSF record so far,"I have to say that I have been waiting for this record for a long time. I've loved all the BSF records from the past the sound quality was always much to be desired. Usually when I am this stoked about a record I am seriously let down. When I first put in ""After the Eulogy"" I was blown away, the first track is just awesome. I listened to the whole record reading the lyrics as I went. There were a couple songs that didn't grab me right away but they all have my full attention now. The lyrics are amazing, the strongest for BSF yet. I was afraid what the band was going to be like without Darrel but they are still way good! I can't recommend this release enough if you are a BSF fan already or if you want a good introduction to the band!"
5,wow,"yet again, boy sets fire manages to produce music that goes beyone anything you could ever expect. The lyrics alone are amazing. Combine killer words with equally wonderful music and the result is astounding. boy sets fire manages to take so many things i am feeling and turn them into songs that scream what i can't find words for. I've had this cd for 3 weeks and it has not been taken out of my cd player. my review can't even do this cd justice, it's just my pathetic attempt to tell everyone how necessary this cd is."
5,The best collage game,This game is one of the best games for collage i think that there is and if you have nfl gameday 2003 i would recomend you to get this game so you could draft people from this game to the other ... but even if you dont have nfl gameday 2003 this game is still very good
3,No major complaints,"The product arrived in a timely manner. There is a gash at the base of the spine. However, it looks fresh and may have occurred during shipping. It's unsightly, but does not affect the soundness of the book."
1,Ridiculous,"This six volume masterwork is written by a Jefferson fanatic. The veneration for Jefferson that Dumas Malone puts on paper borders on outright worship. Jefferson seems not to have been a man, but an infallible demi-god.According to Malone, if Jefferson was wrong about something, he didn't really mean it. If he made a mistake, he had good reasons and it was actually someone else's fault. If he lied (which he did A LOT), he did it to protect the integrity of the country and it was completely understandable under the circumstances. I've never read so much double talk in all my life. By the time you get to Jefferson's presidency, it gets pretty tough to gag down the copious amounts of praise that Malone spews from his pen.This is basically a massive kids' book, showing us the guy on the two dollar bill through rose, white, and blue glasses. If you want an accurate depiction of Jefferson, check out Joseph Ellis's American Sphinx."
5,A well detailed view of the beginning of a nightmare,"A most insightful and highly detailed work concerning man's worst scientificly guided attrocities. And most releavent to those living in this very day.This book covers the origins of Hitler's Nightmare. It did not begin with the Jews or the Gypsies, it began with the mentally ill and the disabled. Thie book begins here and gives us not just the crimes but insights into the minds of the criminals who perpetrated it. Men who were collage educated and socially quite liberal rather than the mercenary uneducated thugs who operated the death camps.A must read for those interested in this subject."
2,A disappointment!,"Although the roles of Marie and Wozzeck are sung well, the supporting roles are inaccurate in terms of pitch, unfortunately. If you can read the score and hear the difference, seek another performance, using the fine singing in the Fischer-Dieskau/Lear recording (mine is on LP) as a benchmark for musicality. Lear is quite amazing in the role of Marie, and many of you have probably heard Fischer-Dieskau's really good work in the excerpt used in music appreciation classes."
3,Great Reference but Difficult for beginners,"I found the first 4 chapters to be clear and very instructive. At the beginning of chapter 5, Mr. Goodman assures the reader ""Don't worry if you don't fully comprehend everything [in this chapter]"". I waded through, getting some parts but not all, just as he had cautioned. In the chapters that followed, however, I didn't get a sense of a return to clear, instructive reading: it just seemed to get harder.For beginners I would recommend The Tao of AppleScript-- this is a much gentler introduction and while not as thorough as Mr. Goodman's book, I found it more comprehensible. After reading it, I was able to get a lot more out of Danny Goodman's AppleScript Handbook."
1,This book is the Old Testament of AppleScript - Move On!,"So this would have been a great title, say in 1993. Do yourself a favor, unless you're into antiques, and get a real AppleScript book like the VQS titles from Peachpit. This book is nice to read, but it refers to an AppleScript of the past and has little relevance in the world of Mac OS X. Why people keep recommending this dinosaur is beyond me."
2,Completely out of date,"As far as I can tell, this was last revised in 1998. It is geared towards (get this) System 7.5. I don't know how it is otherwise -- I decided I didn't really want to corrupt my brain by teaching ti stuff that was five years out of date."
3,Set it Off...it wasnt but not totally bad,"I didn't think that this movie was as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Where I personally think where this movie went wrong was the far fetched scenes in this movie. Sometimes during the movie I had to look over at my boyfriend and we both gave each other that ""come on"" type of look, like are they really serious.I will say as always Tyrese Gibson gives a spectacular performance and he is probably the only believable character in the movie. Go see the movie during the matinee showing that way you get an alright movie for an alright price.I am glad I saw it, but come on what do you want from a movie whose premise is the modern day Bonnie and Clyde. I am sorry but bank robberies aren't that easy to get away with these days. Come on Hollywood lets get on the ball with crimes that are really prevalent this day and age."
5,Very Happy,"Th movie came brand new, wrapped in the plastic covering and everything. The DVD itself was intact. It was shipped very fast; it took only about a week. I am very satisfied and would recommend this to everyone!"
1,Should have been called a Waste of Time,"Waist Deep is an awful attempt at an action/revenge movie. First off there is hardly an action in it. The car chase scenes are ridiculous, the acting is terrible(with the execption of Tyrese and Meagen), Game's performance is the worst out of all of them, Tyrese and Meagen are totally ""wasted"" here, the script is attrocious, and everything else just sucks. Waist Deep is an attrocious, ridiculous mess that should not be seen and should be forgotten. This was dreadfulBig Big Big Big Big Thumbs down!"
2,just ok,"Tyrese&Meagan Goode are the only performances in this film that work. but the film on a whole is real generic. it wants to be a modern day ""Bonnie&Clyde"" but it lacks any kind of depth. everything is very predictable. alot of over the top action. The Game is in this film&this should be his last film. if Tyrese&Meagan Goode get a real script then they might be on to something."
5,Action Packed!,I really enjoyed the cast of characters in this movie. The reality of what could happen and the element ofsurprised captivated me while watching this movie.
5,AMAZING!!!,I love this movie for one it co- starred my favorite actress; Meagan Good! Second; Tyrese Gibson is in it! And it deals with crime- action which catches my attention right away! You should definitely rent or buy this movie!
3,waist deep,"I liked this movie and think meagan good is shaping up to be a really good actress, and well Tyrese is too sexy!!a good movie"
3,Good Movie,"I thought it was a decent movie. It won't win an oscar or anything but it was pretty entertaining, and of course the girl is nice."
4,Tyrese and Meagan???,"This is another hood fairy tale. For the majority, it is unrealistic and very predicatable with the exception of one, maybe two twists and turns. All-in-all, it is a good movie, but I wouldn't suggest buying it. It's one of those films that I personally would only watch once. If you find the plot summary interesting, I recommend that you rent it."
4,Intriguing novel set in occcupied Paris towards the end of WW2,"This is one of Genet's lesser known works and not his best but it has an interesting theme in the second half of the book which follows the life of imaginary Riton a Nazi collaborator in occupied Paris in 1944. Parallel to the account of Riton and his love for a German soldier is the grief of Genet the narrator over the death of French resistance fighter and lover Jean. It is Genet's sympathetic portrayal of Riton and rational explanation that for a young petty thief, a gun and food from the Germans was a better bet than the life of a patriotic resistance fighter which captured my interest. Genet's well documented struggles with authority gives authenticity to this novel as you become aware of the difference of patriotism within a nation and that the poor are less concerned who is ruling their country than those who have something to lose."
2,NOT a popular history of telecommunications!,"If you're thinking that this book is a comprehensive popular overview of the history of telecommunications, forget it. It really is about Morton Bahr's career with the Communications Workers of America. After reading Tom Standage's outstanding ""Victorian Internet"" book, my view of the Web as the modern-day telegraph was enhanced. But, the title of this book is so unfairly mis-leading, that it's a shame. Don't look to this book as a popular history of the Internet! In fact, I intend to return it and get another book."
1,I took it back,"I bought this VCR at Circuit City and returned it two days later. The unit is really beautiful out of the box and looked good next to DVD recorder/player. I purchased the Sony VCR to transfer tapes to DVD discs. Trouble is, with its ""19-micron"" head, the Sony unit cannot play a lot of tapes, even prerecorded ones. The manual says that it cannot play some LP tapes recorded on VCRs of other manufacturers, but I had trouble finding any tape of mine that it would play. Even manual tracking could not fix the problem. I took it back to Circuit City."
2,Not John McLaughlin's Group,"This is an album of very pleasant Indian-flavored New Age music. But if you're looking for John McLaughlin's group Shakti, this isn't it. Amazon doesn't realize this, and they are pairing this album with other albums by John McLaughlin and Shakti in their twofer promotions. Don't be fooled."
3,Handyman,"I thought that the video would be more like his past worship projects. The video was more like a trip through a few albums. The behind the scenes left a little to be desired. But on a whole I have to be fair, If I were not comparing it to his past works it would be a solid DVD..."
4,Great Material,Only problem with this is that the video is not in sync with the music. I wonder how long it took them to make it like that?Music is great tho. Bless God for Fred and em.
4,Uplifiting and Inspirational,"I thoroughly enjoyed this music DVD. I purchased the ""Free to Worship""CD with the 3-video mini-DVD. I enjoyed the mini-DVD so much that Ipurchased the DVD to see the whole concert. I was not disappointed."
2,Dissapointed,"I guess I'm the only one who thinks that this is Fred's worst offering yet. I bought, got excited and got ready for an awesome experience. It never came.The sounds was bad. Very bad. 'nough said!The video had me feeling sea sick.Fred has done much better on previous DVD so why did he sanction this one? Does he know about this DVD?Sorry if it's just me."
4,Great!!,"I have truly been blessed by this DVD. (but I am always blessed by anything Fred Hammond does:))I enjoyed the DVD. I love all the songs especially the way More of You and A Closer Walk were done! I was a little disappointed in the presentation of the DVD though. I guess I would have liked to see it flow better, I wanted to feel like I was at the recording instead of watching it. I was expecting what I saw on the Speak Those Things,Purpose By Design and Pages of Life DVD...but other than that no complaints about anything else! A huge blessing! I've been playing it non stop!! A must get!"
2,Primrose Path of Grammatical Dalliance,"Check out Section 4: ""Variety,"" in which the author manages to think that the sentence ""The school band, who performed at the local Apple Festival, were a great success"" is acceptable. Where is her section on collective nouns when she needs it? *Which* performed. *Was* a great success. I don't ask for much from a style manual, but I do ask that it does not at least reinforce for my students the kinds of errors they are already making."
4,Mein KMFDM,"This was my first introduction to KMFDM. I am a fan of Tim Skold's, and of his previous efforts from Shotgun Messiah, to his solo albums, to even now his tenure in Manson. Anyway, I loved the first song on this album. Attak/Reload is an awesome opener, and has some of the coolest music I have ever heard. Dirty and Skurk were both nice driving anthems, and Sturm and Drang is quite the rocker as well.Now the bad:I thought Urban Monkey Warfare had all the potential to be a great song, but the lyrics were very weak. Save me, even though I love skold, was very trite, and very simplistic, and Risen was pretty retarded.I agree with another reviewer that Yo Ho Ho was pretty cool.All in all, this album made me go purchase WW3, and unfortunatley I didn't enjoy that album very much. It seemed very formulaic. This album seems to have taken a lot of chances. I've heard that adios is probably the closest thing to this album, so maybe I'll pick that one up next!"
5,Attacks your former idea of KMFDM and builds a better one!,"Attak is my all time favorite KMFDM cd. If you want to start listening to KMFDM, or just want to keep growing your collection, this is THE cd you must get. It satisfies all the means! ""Attak/Reload"" starts the cd off with a great beat and great vocals. ""Dirty"" may just be my favorite track, for Waitts perfectly distributes his voice to the dark, heavy riffs. ""Urban Monkey Warfare"" keeps the beat strong, while ""Yohoho"" brings the cd to a new section of a sweet drum beat, and great vocals. ""Strum & Drang"" is another of my favorites because of its shear power! Over all, the cd is like a bliss of overwelming, splendid music. GET THIS CD! I'm SURE you'll love it!"
3,now if I only had a beard!,"My favorite songs are dirty, Sturm und Drang and risen. Attak,skurk, urban monkey warfare and preach/pervert are okay songs. The rest of the album I didn't care for because well... you know why. I like listening to the good songs because when I hear them I just start to rock out which I really seem to enjoy. Alot! It would be nice if more of their songs were in german because it gives them a heavier sound."
2,Oh well.,"You kids remember More & Faster? Did you rock out to Money back in the day? Have a What Do You Know, Deutschland? poster hanging over your bed? Yeah, I did too. You didn't take it too seriously because it was already pretty tongue-in-cheek, even then, and deliberately so. But it was fun rock music by crazy Germans, and it didn't reek of stale guitar riffs and big hair. A friend, knowing that I owned every KMFDM release from day one, got me this CD for my birthday. I wasn't going to bother. I wouldn't have been missing much. The irony and iconic bigger-than-life image is gone. Now Sascha is a 40-something rocker who's convinced himself of his own seriousness. Plus, Skold is a tool. It's sad. Just like the Foetus and the early PIG stuff, I still throw Money & WDYKD? in the CD player every now and then and reminisce, but it's not the same."
2,Maybe they should have stayed dead,"This album lacks many things, such as some of its original core members, fluidity, and fun. KMFDM and other projects from Sascha have been going down hill since KMFDM originally broke up, Sascha has become mean and disgruntled towards ex-members work and has become quite hostile. This has affected his work and made this album less then stellar compared to older albums prior to their original breakup. Sascha should have refrained from trying to bring back KMFDM, that way he could have left us with a good memory of the greatness that KMFDM once achieved.Just a note, this album does have a few good tracks, but those are the ones that Raymond Watts worked on, so you might as well save your money and buy a PIG album (Raymond Watts band) instead."
4,DON'T BUY HERE!,"this is a good cd so it gets 4 stars. Don't buy it from amazon though. They don't have it and for some reason it's impossible for them to get it. Buy it from a store, rip the system"
1,Same old junk from German band KMFDM,More bleeps and bloops. Along with some guy screaming into the microphone. This record is a real award winner.
4,Best of '02 so far.,"It is true that the absense of Esch and Guenter can be heard, but don't let that stop you from giving Attak the chance it deserves. Even w/o 2 core members Sascha and co. still manage to put out a listenable album. This is the heaviest KMFDM has been since the days of Nihil and Angst, but on a different, more electronic level. Take Attak/Reload for example, currently the best example of what ""industrial"" music could be. Or how about Dirty? With Watts on vocals, sounding as sleezy as ever. Sturm und Drang is w/o a doubt the heaviest moment on the album, possibly even their history; 2nd only to Ultra, A Drug Against War, or even Rabblerouser. There's really only 3 tracks on here that I could've done w/o: Skurk, Sleep, and Yo ho ho. If the Sturm und Drang tour hits your town, go see them live. It'll probably give you a new view of what Attak really is."
2,an earlier fan,"i've heard a lot of KMFDM in my day and this is by far their weakest entry. if you are really interested in KMFDM i think XTORT and NIHIL are the best to check out. if you must have a complete selection go ahead, i guess you can't hear KMFDM shout they are ""back for me"", ""ultra heavy beat"", or ""KMFDM blah"". i am a fan, just not of this record. i guess they are making a follow up. i hope it turns out better. i saw them this summer with raymond watts <pig> you might want to check out PIG. they are pretty excellent."
1,BEWARE - Not for Windows XP,"Look out - this card is for older versions of Windows only, not Windows XP. Although it's not obvious from the main page for this product on Amazon, Amazon is selling a 2001 version of the Siemens SpeedStream PCMIA 10/100 Ethernet Card (SS1012). As a result, there is no driver for Windows XP included. If you go to the Siemens website, you learn that there IS NO DRIVER for Windows XP for this product. Siemens later came out with a different version of the SS1012, and that different version does have a Windows XP driver. But for this older version sold by Amazon, only the earlier versions of Windows are supported. Wish I'd known that before I ordered this."
5,Finally,If you are looking for a cup were the flow control valve doesnt pop out when it hits the floor these are the ones! Every other cup I have tried did NOT hold up to a solid fall then my son was able to shake out the liquid. I have not had a problem with leaking and I have ALWAYS taken apart the flow control disk when washing so mold hasnt been an issue in our home. I highly recommend this cup if you have a child who likes to throw or drop things.
5,Compatible with Other Avent Products,"I actually came across these sippy cups completely by accident. In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles. I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable. Well, they are. I like how some of the newer ones have little stars. The colors, even when mixed and matched don't look tacky."
3,Keeps spout clean but leaks,"I've used Avent products for both of my children and I've become accustomed to the bottles leaking through the sides, but these cups are not worth the money. They leak through the spout and through the sides, where the cap screws on, and milk gets all over the place. The only good thing about these cups is they come with a cap so the spout stays clean."
2,Not a good choice,I bought this cup because the spout is soft but then I found out it is difficult to get the valves out and they are a two piece thing which makes it easy to loose or misplace. I prefer to use the playtex cups now!
2,2 1/2 stars - It Leaks,"I initially liked these cups because my daughter prefered the spout to other cups and they had the removable and interchangeable handles. But they leak. First I thought it was a defective one so I exchanged it but the new ones do the same thing. It is not from the spout, it is from the part where the top and bottom screw together. It is ok if it is upright but if it gets knocked over and is left on its side or upside down it will leak. To bring it in a diaper bag I have to put it in a ziplock bag so it won't get other things wet."
2,Not for my son,"I highly support many Avent products, as I have been breastfeeding my son, I have used their breast pump and bottles all with great success. I tried using these cups for my son since he was 6 months old with no success. He's now over a year and drinks well from a cup, but not the magic cup. The magic cup leaked for me many times, when I called Avent customer service they told me I was putting the valve in too tight, but no matter what I tried, they leaked. Also, my son never got accustomed to the spout. Instead, he has been using the Playtex Straw Cup, which he uses very easily. My son prefers to drink from straws, or even the cheap Rubbermaid Take Along sip cups. Maybe you'll have more success, but in my opinion, the sippy part of the magic cup is too hard to suck on (yes, I've tried it), and it was not a match for my son. Other than this product, I highly recommend other Avent products."
5,Clever Design,"I bought a few different sippy cups and have found the Avent Magic Cup Trainer to be superior to all others. It has a very clever design. The handles detach so you can remove them when your child no longer needs them. I tried a cup with a slanted design, but the lid would not screw on in the right direction, so it's useless. The Avent, on the other hand, is vertical, so you don't have to worry about how to attach the lid. My son is 6 months old, and isn't too fond of drinking water from a bottle, but when I put it in the sippy cup, he loved it! It's like a game to him and he enjoys the challenge. It's also nice that he can turn it upside down and it doesn't leak."
2,these cups leak!,"I am lucky - I have a 14 mo. daughter who will drink from almost anything. However, having used Avent bottles and pump early on, I stuck with the avent brand cups. Using them at home as fine, except for the fact that the top is in 5 pieces, including the lid! (Lid, spout, ring, and two-part valve). A lot of chance for losing parts. When we started toting them everywhere we went, I noticed they really leak. Not from the spout, they are spill-proof in that respect. It is where the ring screws onto the cup. It doesn't seem to seal well. My husband and I joked that we should wrap the threads with teflon tape like for a leaky plumbing problem. I am not the only one to have had this problem, another mom of a toddler at the library said she had the exact same problem. I thought I was doing myself a favor buying one of the most expensive sippy cups and have put off buying new ones because they were so expensive. But we are on our way to purchase some cheaper, more effective cups."
2,not really worth the $,"I have loved all of the Avent products but these just really didn't work for us. I had no problems with leaking just washing EVERY piece that goes with each cup, and keeping track of them all -- pain in the butt! Each cup has 6 pieces and 4 of them are essential for making the cups work, so if you missplace one, your outta luck! I bought about 12 of these cups and after a few weeks of use, i sold them ...!"
1,Do not waste your money,I was very unhappy with these cups. I bought them originally becasue of the brand name but soon found that they were a waste of money because they LEAK like a sive.
1,Not Pleased,"I bought these cups number one because they were bigger than the Playtex cups i was currently using since my one year old was drinking more and secondly i liked the idea of a coated plastic spout, seemed it would be more comfortable for my daughter to drink out of. Yes i was a ..., i thought because they cost a little more, they would be better, boy was i wrong and i'm going to write the company so they know the kind of defective, expensive product they are selling. The cups LEAK! My one year old is not careful in setting down her cup and often throws it when she's done and juice goes everywhere! I'm always cleaning up after that ... cup as if i didn't have enough to clean up! Very dissatisfied and would not reccomend anyone buying them."
1,These cups attract mold!,"I thought that I would like these cups, as they looked like they would be easy to use. I have to admit, my baby got the hang of drinking from it very quickly. However, if you do not pull the inside disc completely out and let it dry seperately, the area gets filled with mold very quickly (especiall if you use apple juice). I did not realize that the disc neeeded to be removed, and I was just washing around it. I ended up throwing them all out! I am not too sure what cup to use though, as all of the cups that I have tried leak to some extent...."
2,Unhappy,I bought this cup because it seemed easy for my daughter to use.But it leaks every where even after i bought new nipples for it.
2,"I hate these cups, but my son liked it early on.","I like a lot of Avent products, but not their sippy-cups. We have consistently had problems with leaks, and there are 6 (count them!) 6 separate parts to wash for each cup. (7 parts if you're washing the spout cover too). There are much better-designed cups available.That said, I admit my son took to this cup easily when we were first introducing sippy-cups. Also, the leakage wasn't so bad at first- it has gotten worse over time. And at least all the parts are machine-washable. . . but I will not buy this cup again."
5,Easy trainer,"The Avent trainers are a great addition to the Avent line of bottles. We found it very easy to switch our daughter to the sippy-cup @ around 10 mos. The cups are easy to store and cleaning is not bad, as long as you remember to wash each part of the lid. I find it easy to just take everything apart and put it in the dishwasher. I reccommend these cups for anyone who is trying to switch over and having trouble with the standard hard tipped cups."
1,Bad Design,"I do not know if this is just because we live in the Northeast where it is very humid but all Avent sipply cups grow mold inside the spout. It is very difficult to clean, since there is nothing that fits inside - too small for a nipple brush, a tooth brush, even for a toothpick with cotton on the end. Be very careful and buy a lot of replacement spouts. Check them every day, especially if you use them for juice."
1,These were really bad!!!,I bought these cups to start off my 6 month old baby boy. We dropped a cup of apple juice under the car seat and didn't find it for 4 days. The darn thing molded and it took me 4 hrs to get the goop out from the lid where the seal can be removed. There is no telling if the cup is ever really clean. For the money I paid I expected a better model. Work work work! I can barely take a sip from them- it's more like a suck cup. The cup is too large and too heavy as well. I went with the playtex ones just 2 pieces and the disposable cups everyone is raving about. hope this helps.
5,Wouldn't Use Anything Else,These cups are the best!! My daughter is 9 months old and will only drink from her Avent cups - she refuses her bottle. I found that most of the other cups out there had hard plastic spouts which she did not take to. These spouts are not as soft as bottle nipples but are more rubbery and since she is teething she loves to bite it. Wouldn't trade them for anything.
1,Not a good product,Okay it might depend on your child. I have tried for weeks to get my son to take these cups. I've tried both valve and removing the valve and all he does is scream at the cups and throw them on the ground.Someone mentioned Nuby brand sippy cups to me and I got some of them. My son took to them the first try and hasn't had a problem yet with them.
2,"Great idea, but not a great product.","I use all Avent products in my home (bottles, pacifiers, bottle warmers, etc.), but I'm not a fan of this sippie cup. The spout is shaped SO weird, it's hard for babies to ""latch"" on to. I also don't think the drink comes out fast enough for the babies.What I do like about these cups, though, is how you can interchange with the Avent bottles. For example, I took the sippy cup handles, and put it on the bottles when my baby was learning to hold a bottle. Or, I'd put the sippy cup spout on a bottle. Or, I'd put a bottle nipple on the sippy cup. The interchangeability is pretty cool, but my kids just won't use the sippy cup spouts."
2,Many better cups out there,"The only good thing to say about these cups is that they have rubber spouts which can be easier to little ones learning to first use a cup. However, fluids do not easily come out of the spout and children end up sucking a lot of air and getting frustrated. Playtex cups are by far the best I've found."
3,tough to keep clean,Like many customers i was excited at first about AVENT training cups. My son started to use the cup at four months and the nipple design worked great for him. The problem with these cups is keeping them clean. I love to use my dishwsaher and these cups easily get moldy under the two layers of plastic that keep it spill proof. You can take them apart but the second hard plastic layer is a pain to get off. Too much trouble in the long run.
2,Avent Needs to Develop a New Spout,"I loved my Avent cups...at first! They were the first sippy cups we tried when my child was 5 months old because we loved the Avent bottles. My child is now 21 months old and we have used several other brands of sippy cups. The Avent brand is my least favorite! There are so many parts and they are difficult to clean. Fluids get trapped in difficult places and they become disgusting! The soft spouts also become stained easily. The only positive points to these cups are that they don't spill easily, are interchangeable with the Avent bottles, are clear, and the handles can be moved to different potitions in relationship to the spout. But, please don't waste your money. I'm throwing all my Avent cups out because I dislike them so much! Buy Playtex or Gerber and save yourself the hassle!"
2,This cup stinks!,"I got this cup for my 8 month old daughter. She won't drink from it at all. I tested it myself and found the water inside had a very bad plastic taste that almost made me throw up. No matter how I wash and boil this cup, it starts to stink whenever I screw the ring and sprout on. Plain water tastes terrible after staying in it for half an hour. I ended up throwing the cup away and using an Avent bottle body. Why waste money on it? Just buy a sprout to go with an old bottle!"
2,"Durable, but they leak!","My son used Avent bottles and we were very happy with them so I bought the sippy cups! Expensive but I thought they would be worth the money because I loved the bottles so much. Okay I finally figured out how to cause the leak from not happening out the sides, by not putting it on to tight. But, if my son tips the cup over it leaks. Yes I do have the insert in correctly. I ended up tossing them in the garbage! There goes $20.00 out the window! I don't to be constantly wiping up the mess. I will have to say for as many times as the cup has been dropped from the highchair...they have never cracked!"
2,"Thrilled at first , but. . .","I was very excited when I first bought these cups. My son was having trouble getting the hang of switching from breastfeeding to sippy cups. He took to the white ""infant"" spouts on this cup very quickly and our problem seemed to be solved.HOWEVER, after 2 or 3 happy months, our cups started leaking everywhere. Even holding it upright, (but especially on it's side), the milk welled up underneath the rim and leaked out. All our cold-pack bags now smell our sour milk. I called customer service and they informed me that the valves ""wear out"" every 2 months or so and that I would have to buy new valve sets every couple of months to keep this from happening. I could buy several new Gerber cups (which haven't leaked yet) for the amount of money I've spent on new valve sets. I agree that if Avent could fix this, these would be great cups.Like I said, great for the transition, but I wouldn't make it your primary cup unless you don't mind continuing to spend the extra money."
5,Wet Seal Prevents Leaks,"We are on the second child and still getting great use out of our Avent sippies. Our 6 month old has refused all prior attempts at bottle feeding, but loves these cups. As for the leaking reported by some users, these cups use a wet seal. Just flush each piece with water immediately prior to assembling and be sure to pull the spout all the way into the ring. We have had fewer problems with leaking with these than with any other cup, and they are the only ones I feel can be cleaned thoroughly."
1,This cup developed mold and was unsafe,"This was the first sippy cup I purchased for my daughter and she learned to use it quick. However, I soon found out, as others have that mold develops under the pieces and in the spout very easily. This has six pieces and is too much to wash. I recommend using another brand."
1,We hate these cups!,"These cups are AWFUL! Black ""stuff"" (I'm assuming mold) accumulated in the drink spout and I could not get it out. We only had 2 and they both went in the trash. I never had problems with them leaking, just keeping them clean! I never put these in the dishwasher and I still had these problems. Don't waste the money!"
2,Too much trouble!!,"I bought these cups because I was having trouble getting my child to take any of the other cups. He actually started taking these cups really well so I loaded up on them. OH WHAT A MISTAKE!! I now have $20.00 worth of cups (which is only 4 cups) that are ruining my diaper bags. I have to unload the diaper bag all the time and clean the sticky juice off of everything. They leak everywhere!! I know people say its error on my part, but it shouldnt be this hard to put a sippy cup together!! I also agree on the fact that the inside ring gets soooo nasty. I find stuff caught in it all the time!! It scares me that I might have given my child that cup with the ring like that. Also my child is almost a year and has 8 teeth and when he has actually bitten holes in the spout. I only gave this cup two stars for the fact it was the only cup my child would actually take at first!"
3,great...but,I LIKE AVENT PRODUCTS THE ONLY THING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS IT LEAKS UNDER THE RING.. I'VE TRIED MANY WAYS BUT IT'S NOT HELPING
2,Yup.....they leak.,Loved the Avent Bottles (Even thought they too always leaked. So I naturally went to the cups...BUT the rubber sippy part also molds very quickly. I had a cup pre-made in the fridge for less than about 24hrs and for some reason I thought to check for leaks and saw the mold! Water/juice gets trapped in the rubber thingy...that is also part of why it leaks. I too wrote to the company about my bottles leaking and they said it was user error. I'm putting them on too tight. Looking for good alternatives for training cups! Good luck.
2,A royal pain,"I thought these cups would be perfect since we used the Avent bottle...we could just purchase the sippy cup spout and spill proof valves and be done. Well, that part was great, but that was about the only part that was.My cup tops never seemed clean. No mattter how many times I would wash them. They were not always easy to dis-assemble either. It took a lot of time and work that I did not have while trying to care for 2 kids. I lost a lot of the circle valves while trying to keep all of the parts together.Way too many pieces for a sippy cup"
2,Not crazy with the cleaning,I have to admit these cups were excellent against spilling. However when it came down to cleaning the plastic pieces it was a pain in the neck. Eventually I broke off the hard plastic peice do to the difficulty of cleaning.
2,Good and bad,My son really took to this cup around 8 mos. old. He had trouble getting it started because he had to suck so hard to get anything to come out. I don't like the cup because there are SO many pieces. I really prefer the First Years Clean and Simple cups.
1,Does not fit,"I got two of these to fit a Savage 11LF with a 30mm scope and a 54C PSL with no scope, well it will not fit ether one, the dimensions on Amazon are OD and not ID so take about 1.5"" off for that, Amazon however was great and sent me a return label and I ordered larger cases, order a bigger case than you need, because Murphy's law will always prevail."
4,Good for the price,"If you do not want nothing fancy, just something to hold the gun and cheap, this case is for you. I use these cases for things like BB Guns and Airsoft Guns. Why? Cause I can lock them and it keeps them out of the way from the possibility of kids getting into them, at least without some case sawing. Would I use a ""real"" rifle in them. Doubtful. But it serves it purpose. If you just want to carry the gun, it would work for that too."
4,An okay case,"The case looks great and is light weight. The only concern of mine is that by saving weight I think they compromised durability. The case is a little flimsy for my taste -- definitely not as nice as Plano's pistol cases. There was tons of room in this case--almost to much. I use it for a handful of rifles and a Win shotgun when not in soft cases and everything fits. For example, my '96 Win M-94 .30/30 has to much room for my taste. I had much trouble finding a hard case fitted for rifles with 20"" barrels. Again, not a bad case for the price though."
2,RWS 460 doesnt fit here,"I bought this product to store my RWS 460 with scope, guess what, doesn't fit, so be aware of this, I your gun is big and has a scope, probably this box will not work..."
2,Disappointed,"The plastic is getting flimsy and they try a lot of raised graphics on the outside to make it a little more rigid..My main concern is the egg-crate foam... Really thin and does absolutely nothing to keep the rifle from sliding back and forth (Winchester Model 64). If you go on the cheap like I did, as this will not be transported just for storage, get a silicon gun sock to keep it protected..kind of redundant though...best thing is buy another brand that has not cheapened its product yet.."
5,Outstanding value!,"Great budget case. Here is a tip. The egg crate foam is not attached, so get a can of foam adhesive, spray the back of the foam as well as the inside of the case, be sure you dont overspray into areas the foam doesn't reach. Let it get tacky, put foam back carefully. push down on foam all the way around. Then let it sit flat open for at least 2 hours. this will keep the foam from moving due to the weieght of your weapon."
3,ok,Not to crazy about this case...handle a little ruff to carry a lot... but for what I use it for is its perfect. To store my air rifle and pellets. Oh and foam inside was a little to thin (cheap)
4,Good Enough,"For the price this is a basic gun case made of heavy plastic with 2"" foam top and bottom to protect your gun.. Had to use rubber cement to secure the foam inside or when U open the case it will fall out. Would recommend this for low budget minded people, LIKE me..."
2,Way too small even for a scoped 22,Product is flimsy and foam insert is thin and falls out of case each time you open it. Case is too small even for a 10/22 Ruger with a scope. I should have spent more. You get what you pay for.
4,Good Case for the Money,This is a fairly basic case but it is well worth the price. It is probably not heavy duty enough for traveling. I would recommend it.
4,A great book!!,"I think that this book is pretty good. I gave it 4 stars because usualy Full House books are always great to read. Sure at the begining it can be a little bor-ing at first. But when you get into the middle of the book, it starts getting more interesting. Thats why you never know how the book is going to turn out. Two-for-one Christmas fun is really about when Allie Taylor and Stephanie Tanner want to spend the rest of Christmas vacation hanging out together. But- then they meet this really cute boy named James that they both liked! So what is going to happen next? If you wanna know more about this book, please get the book, and read it. I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
4,Flats,The shoes are a little smaller so order a size bigger. These shoes weren't made for long walks. I was in pain for a while after walking the strip in Las Vegas. They are cute and so fashionable. I love them.
3,Cute But Uncomfortable,"I have these in the black and white polka dot pattern and yes they are adorable but they are also incredibly stiff and uncomfortable. I have worn them nearly every day since receiving them in order to break them in but the canvas like material has yet to soften at all, I don't reccomend this shoe to anyone who spends a great deal of time walking or even just standing, the cute factor doesn't outweight the discomfort."
5,Useful tool for teachers,This CD is a perfect tool to view violence from another perspective and how the zero tolerance policy can be a controversial issue.
5,Hits the spot,"I recently just saw this film and at the end I sat and wondered how could this ever happen. As i sat though the film (with floods of tears running down my face, in some parts)..I thought about all the pain and truth in it and started to question injustice issues and bully issues that occur everywhere. Wouldn't it be great if we could let every teacher, every bully, everyone who is anyone see the pain and tortue some people go through just to get an education. Whats the point. To me this film helped me realise that there is help out there, one way or another, justice will be given. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt like this and not just to those people, but to anyone who hasn't, but wants to know what is going on in that troubled mind. The answer is in front of u, just watch this film."
5,Bang Bang was a hit!,"I used this in a high school class at the end of a unit on teen culture (friendships, cliques, bullying, etc.). The kids LOVED it! It also brought the whole unit together for them. I talked to them before showing it about some parts (without giving the ending away), as they can trigger emotion, and I wanted to assure that the students were comfortable. The classes who viewed this were on the edge of their seats...They are STILL talking about it!!!"
3,High School,"I vaguely remember watching this movie in High School, I thought I liked it, so I searched for it on Amazon, found it, don't like it so much now. But.....what can I say?"
4,AMAZING FILM,"This is one of those movies that almost all of you guys do not know about. Hopefully, if you read my reviews, you will be reading this one. This movie talks aobut the life of a boy who gets bullied around and one day snaps and terrorizes his school. Think of it as ""Assault on precinct 13"" meets the columbine shooting. This movie is very good and I really recommend this film to all."
2,You know what ticks me off?,"THIS.What was the point of even making this movie? Wishful thinking? To put this in your head and WISH its what happened at Columbine? To PRETEND this is what will happen next time sh** goes down at a school? If your world revolves around wishes and delusions like that, good luck with life. You will be the smiling ignorant f*** caught in the face by a stray bullet.You want to live in your perfect world of happy endings? Watch this.You want reality? Watch Zero Day.F*** you people! Seriously!!! UGH!!!!!The two stars goes to the acting, cast and that this movie COULD HAVE BEEN amazing. The fairytale ending made it a horrible waste of time."
1,disgusting,"The point of this movie is the opposite of what it purports to be. `Bang Bang You're Dead' was clearly designed to pollute innocent minds. It pretends to have a morally uplifting message. But nothing could be further from the truth. In case you are nave about what is going on in the world; there is a network of criminals who control the media. This network of criminals is focused on corrupting the minds of innocent children. They are trying to create chaos in the world. This movie, among other things, is telling children that one possible reaction to being bullied at school is to kill people. These criminal filmmakers get away with this type of message by pretending to say, ""Killing people is a bad idea."" In reality, the point of the film is to put the idea into the minds of children that killing people is an option.Putting this type of imagery into the mind of a child is criminal behavior. ""Teachers"" who are having their students watch this film should be arrested for child abuse. Word"
3,Scorching sketches,"3 1/2A little too experimentally playful, on top of a sometimes similar acoustic backbone, will sometimes play at the expense of their already fully-realized fused sound to be THT's one must own album, but MIAE nonetheless provides sturdy study into the unique, oblique western sound."
2,Bucking the reviewers' trend...,"I purchased this CD based largely upon the previous listeners' reviews, which were unanimously positive. My reaction was consistently negative. I found the tracks to be repetitive, sounding like a disoriented Klezmer band in a futile and random search for its ethnic roots. Discordant, disconnected and distracting."
4,a classic movie about ballet,"The first time I saw this movie, I was eight years old. I always wanted to see it again. I recently bought it and watched it. It's magic, for me, had not dulled with the years. This movie is a classic."
3,Great looking but run very hot,"I've got 3 of the 250 Triples. I love the quality of the case. The LaCie cases are way sturdier than the cheap Western Digital cases I've had in the past. However, they have no fan and the case gets hot to the touch.I've just had my first massive drive failure and lost 160GB of data. Disk Warrior could not find the data. The failure may not be the fault of the LaCie as there is a known issue with FW 800 drives and Mac OS 10.3.x and any brand of drive will fail eventually but I'm gun shy now and I bought a Maxtor to replace it. Ironically, the drive inside the LaCie is actually a Maxtor.I would have given a 5 before the failure. Now it gets a 3."
2,Listen to other's experience before buying a D2,"There is no doubt that this is one sexy product. The problem is what you don't see from the outside. The hard drive is good when it is working, but like others have said....once it goes down, that's it.I bought the 1st generation 80gb version, and it is now reduced to a clicking piece of crap that does not work. Not to mention it being full of all my AV work that i do for a living. Most of it was luckly backed up, but others have not been so lucky.Can't give it 1 star because it served me well for a couple of years, but longevity is not one of Lacie's strong areas."
3,El Coyote,"Dear Music Fan. You need to send an email explaining your dissatisfaction with delivery of this CD or give them a call. It's obvious to me they don't have anyone reading this review stuff or they wouldn't have posted it on this page. You may want to cancel your order as this CD, in my estimation, is quite forgettable. Suggest, ordering 110th Street by Spanish Harlem Orchestra featuring Ruben Blades on four tracks. Banging good."
3,Delay in processing the order,"I have ordered the Salsa Cd two weeks ago, and when I was ordering the item the delivery dates states "" this order will be shiped to you within 24 hours, I have been waiting for it more than two weeks, I am not happy with the service that you are providing me besides I could have got it cheaper from CDNOW, but I did not mind paying more as I was going to get the cd delivered to my home address within 24 hours. Please advise. as if this is going to continue like this I will stop ordering any cd."
3,Outdated,"This book was based on the very first release of Small Business Server 2003 that was released in 2003, and so is outdated. Despite its title, it is 'advanced' only when compared to its 'beginner' predecessor. There are no 'advanced' Small Business Server (SBS) books.Typical of this publisher, the lack of editing is evident from the varying quality of the chapters on substance and spelling and grammar. It could have been published in half as many pages were it not for the redundant Notes boxes and poor page layout. Some authors were very detailed and comprehensive while others left much to be desired. A few chapters remain useful, but there are better and more current titles available today."
3,I've heard worse from Mr Dusty,There were 2 songs on this CD I liked: Bloody Bonza Mate and G'day G'day - that's an improvement on the other offerings I've heard from this Aussie legend. The rest will not add much to your Aussie holiday memories
2,I'm gonna get flamed,"Sorry, but I had to disagree with the rest of the reviews. They all have opinions that are personal, but this album is just...unexciting. It's all been done before, and been done much better. The escapist philosophy of ""One of these days,"" is a bit over-the-top, especally when thinking EVERYONE writes songs about heaven -- many of them a little less selfish. ""Big Fish"" is an embarassment, which can only be enjoyed by the already saved into ""Christian-ese."" Otherwise, it's just another CCM group.. above par for CCM, far below standards outside the bubble."
4,Well Worth Your Time,It took a while for this cd to grow on me but was instantly one of my wife's favorite. I enjoy ONE OF THESE DAYS and think it is a great song. BIG FISH is a lot of fun. My only concern with the cd is when the female takes the lead vocals. She is a little too nasely for me. But he album overall is very good and you should add it to your collection!
4,Reed Organ Manufacturer,"George P. Bent was the founder of the Bent Organ and Piano Company of Chicago. The book was published after his retirement, and contains contributions from his friends in the music business as well as others. Some of the chapters are priceless mini-histories of the music manufacturing business in the latter part of the 19th century. There are also chapters of local history taken from his Iowa boyhood. A rare and worthwhile addition to a musical history collection."
2,No plot,"Not much of a story line here - just a guy who teaches inner city kids, is addicted to drugs, and never recovers"
3,THIS MOVIE IS PROOF OF RYAN GOSLING'S ABILITY. HE IS A BRILLIANT ACTOR.,"GOSLING portrays a teacher in a rough, urban school/neighborhood with a SEVERE drug habit---BUT, he does it BRILLIANTLY. SHAREEKA EPPS is VERY GOOD as troubled young girl, a student in his class, who discovers his drug addiction. This is an independent movie that is completely character driven. Not a feel good movie. RYAN GOSLING is an OVER THE TOP TALENT. I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY HIS PERFORMANCE. The movie is a three, but RYAN GOSLING'S PERFORMANCE IS 5 STARS PLUS."
3,Three and a half...,"Usually, in movies of this type Caucasian teachers are parachuted into some hellhole school and learn to inspire black students who serve as cardboard cut-out background material while carpe diem triumphalism takes hold.In Half Nelson, (a strangely titled 'pro-wrestling hold as drug abuse' metaphor) Ryan Gosling is a hipster history/gym teacher in an as yet un-gentrified predominantly black Brooklyn school whose life spirals out of control as he wallows in self-destruction/cocaine abuse.Gosling is compelling and troubled teacher's pet Shareeka Epps a remarkable stand-out.Minus one and a half stars for a lack of back-story contributing to Mr Dunne's downfall, the lack of peripheral friendships (one can't imagine a guy as gregarious as the protagonist, being such a loner than none of his friends steps in to intervene as he loses control) and pacing.In short, overly performance-driven but these are two masterful performances."
4,good,Good movie but not great like everyone says it is. Great acting by everyone in the film. Towards the end when Don goes to his parents house I really wondered when and how is this film going to end. My brain couldnt take the sadness much anymore. I was glad when this film was over because it's a real downer.
1,The teacher here is unteachable,"I, like another viewer, found this movie ""reprehensible"".If the ""teacher"" had any morals, any courage, he would have voluntarily left the classroom at the beginning of the film. That would have been proper, and it would have kindly ended this movie."
5,A Small Film with a Big Heart,"I'm not much of a film goer--although I certainly love films--but I took the trek into NYC to see this film. I'm certainly glad I did! This is a beautifully crafted film expertly written and directed by Mr. Fleck and Ms. Boden. The smallness of this film makes it breathtaking. I saw it on the big screen somewhere in the Village, and the close-up shots and the quiet dialogue remind me of why screenwriters and directors can often be considered geniuses. I think many times people involved in films are ridiculous in their view of themselves and their talent, but the people involved in the making of this film are excluded from negative criticism on any level. I hope Mr. Fleck and Ms. Boden will someday look at my novel and decide they'd like to make it into a screenplay. If they do, it will be a masterpiece much like HALF NELSON certainly is. A great, great film."
1,Bad movie,"Half Nelson is a long, boring movie that doesn't accomplish anything. There's a lot to do in life. Save yourself two hours by avoiding this film."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Half Nelson features a good performance by Gosling, some nice unexpected moments, and a couple of scenes which should be mandatory viewing for wannabe teachers, but it's too slight and brief to be worth recommending as a film."
5,The Next DeNiro,Ryan Gosling definitely deserves the recognition that he has gotten for this role. He is such a promising young actor and the directors have done a great job in creating an environment in which he explores the character. Shareeka Epps is also a good new find - it will be exciting to see what she does next. Movie buffs and actors alike should definitley check this one out - one of the best simple indie films in awhile. The ending is also refreshing as it gives the audience just enough information to infer the outcome of these characters without spelling anything out. Good storytelling.
3,Mr. Chips ... with Plenty of Coke,"Inner city teacher uses creative methods to engage his students on issues of history and social change, all the while nursing a hefty drug habit. In the process, he strikes up a friendship with Drey, a young black girl who is one of his students. She carries with her the ""secret"" of his drug use.""Half Nelson"" is a gritty movie, bordering at times on a documentary. Ryan Gosling gives a superb performance of the drugged out teacher.Tidy resolutions elude the movie in this slightly depressing but powerful tale."
4,"Gosling, Epps and Mackie are superb as an uncomfortable trio","You can always count on Ryan Gosling to deliver the goods. Gosling broke into the mainstream in ""The Notebook,"" but those of us who enjoy smaller-budget releases knew of his talents with ""The Believer,"" in which he's flat-out incredible. He's also worth seeing in the under-appreciated ""Stay"" (a movie you have to watch twice thanks to the jawdropping ending).Here, Gosling again shows why he's amongst the finest actors working today. However, young Shareeka Epps is a big part of the story here. Her portrayal of young 'Drey' is an eye-opener. She has acting skills well beyond years.I'm also a big fan of Anthony Mackie, whose portrayal of neighborhood dealer 'Frank' (he's also sort of an unofficial ward to Drey) makes him the third part of an uncomfortable trio. Mackie is a great actor as well. We saw him back-to-back in ""Brother to Brother"" and then here in ""Half Nelson."" This is a brave actor willing to commit himself to a role."
3,not exactly goodbye mr chips,"A sad story of a man teacher on a spiral downwho finds a very unlikely friend.We begin to think drugs have this fellow in a full Nelson,but there is some redemption in the twinkie defense...The cheater who sits behind also steals Drey bike,but she finds it and gets it back. We don't know if things will getbetter, but we have some hope."
2,Not recommended for purchase,"Half Nelson had riveting reviews that I considered before purchasing it, but I was disappointed that the movie lead the viewer on several paths without a clear direction. I felt lost all throughout the movie because the plot was unclear. I like Mr. Gosling, but this was clearly an independent film."
1,Where is the plot?,"This was a weird, weird movie.... At the end my husband and I looked at each other and said, ""that was so weird, what was that about?""As a teacher, I noticed that his role in the movie as a teacher was completely unrealistic and misleading. Two thumbs down!"
2,Not my favorite Ryan Gosling Movie,"The film tries to depict a real slice of life, the way it would appear to the person living it. As a result, it's boring beyond belief. There are a few redeeming scenes, but not enough to make me want to watch it again."
2,Save your money.,"I love Ryan Gosling....but not this film. It's choppy, unresolved and...well, if you really want to see it wait for cable or rent it. Save your money."
1,Another Self-Absorbed Fool Fights For Meaning,"This one is a gem. No, really. It is such a train-wreck that you can hardly believe that all these reviewers loved this one. I am sick of movies about people near my age trying to figure out what their life means, or why they are here on earth. The main character is someone who has accepted the responsibility of teaching inner-city youths. That's good, but he fails to meet his responsibility to teach these students. He is too absorbed in his own concerns to provide these students with the instruction they deserve. At one point, he claims that his problems stem from the state of the world, so George w. is too blame for his problems to some extent, but mostly its just his own inability to deal with life. So, if you can't handle self-absorbed liberals failing to meet uphold their responsibilities don't get this one. Have a good day!!!!"
2,Yaaaaaaaawnnnnnnnnnnn!!!,A movie that had fine acting but little story. It took me 5 watchings to get to the end.
3,"A good, not great, biography","Now out in a new edition, Victor Bockris' WARHOL is a very solidly written and researched biography. In particular, the first half creates an extremely detailed portrait of Warhol's Pittsburgh youth; this adds a tremendous amount of context and depth to Warhol's own work, and the meanings and symbolisms of that work will gain new clarity after reading through some of Bockris' book.Unfortunately, the book gets less detailed and more gossipy later on - Warhol's many flaws are underlined again and again, but Warhol surrounded himself with other highly creative people who launched interesting careers of their own - Paul Morrissey and Lou Reed both spring to mind - and Bockris does little or no investigation of Warhol's influence upon them, and any actual ideas just seem to get lost here amid the varied bits of gossip.-David Alston"
2,NOT SO HYPEd ABOUT THESE SHOES,"THESE SHOES, ARE NOT WHAT THEY APPEAR TO LOOK LIKE, YOU NEED TO HAVE WIDE FEET TO HAVE THEM ON, THEY LOOK STRANGE, AND THE LEATHER STRAP AROUND THE ANKLE IS CRAZY, IT IS NOT PUT OF TO THE SIDE LIKE IN THE PICTURES, THE GOLD METAL ENCLOSURE IS RIGHT IN THE FRONT OF YOUR ANKLE, FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. YOU CAN NEVER WEAR THESE WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN PANTS, SO YOU DON'T SEE THE BUCKLE MISPLACED."
5,Innovative approach to flavorful light desserts,I have a large cookbook library and this has consistantly remained at the top of my list of recommendations. The low-fat chocolate chip oatmeal cookies are really a savory compromise. I just prepared the strawberry shortcake for the Bonny Doon Ladies Club and it was a big hit with everyone asking me for the recipe of the lemon poppy seed shortbread.
2,NOT QUITE HITTIN...,Half's song with AZ (Quiet Money) AND #10 Feat. Noreaga are the only songs that I really liked. Probably 3 good songs at best and I will definitely be taking this CD back to the record exchange because I wasn't impressed.
1,Bad product worst support,"I purchased this product a month ago, does not work at all. Technical support was horrible, I finally decided to return it."
3,Good Book for Historians,"This is a fine detailed history of the most deadly accident in American history. It's written for those primarily interested in public transit, railroad, New York City and labor history. It's not for the general interest reader looking for a good story."
4,Good stuff,i first heard of PE'Z from their theme from Gad Guard and since then have really enjoyed the music they play. the vocals leave alot to be desiered but there isn't much and the point of jazz is the music anyway. buy it it's worth 16 bucks!
2,FAR too difficult,"EVEN ON EASY THIS GAME IS WAY TOO HARD! Every pass I throw gets intercepted, and every rushing play becomes a loss. This game is a reason to get anger management classes! I have never played a more frustrating game in my life. Plus, Midway treats football like a pro-wrestling match. It is extremely annoying to have that factored in to an already horrible game. If you want a good football game, get Madden 2003. This game is just horrible."
1,worst game ever,this is one of the worst games I have ever played there was not a single game agenst the machine in which I threw less than five ints and never once did I have one the passing system is terrible you never throw to who you want to it's almost impossible for you to hit a FG and the machine hits it every time even when they are kicking from the 50 yard line I thank my lucky stars that I rented it and didn't buy this game the one thing that is alright about this game is playing against other people that I admit is kind of fun but I had this game for 7 days and I beat the console once I'm only giving it one star because I have to
2,"ok, BUT CAN BE A LITTLE BETTER","I BOUGHT THIS GAME IN LIKE 2001, AND IT IS REALLY HARD TO BEAT THE COMPUTER IN EVEN WEHN IT IS SET TO EASY AND REGULAR EXIBITION. THE CREATE A PLAYER MODE IS OK. NOT WORTH IT TO ME."
4,Older folks at play,"The audience for this film may be people over sixty, but its message has appeal for anyone over twenty.Set in a retirement community in Florida, the characters humorously reflect what it's like to be retiredand find meaning and fulfillment in the ""golden years."" The acting, especially by the women, is terrific.And the guys are charming, and try their best to overcome their fears and limitations.This is definitely an entertaining film about a part of our lives that most of us try not to think aboutuntil we're retired!"
3,Beachie,We had been to Boyton Beach and recognized a few of the clips. It was great to see familiar sites.
3,The Boynton Beach Club,"An Ok movie, bit depressing, needed more laughter..predictable but thatis OK..lI loved in boynton Beach and that is the only reason I purchased it.."
4,Boynton Beach Review,A fun movie whose serious side reflects many of the struggles that people of all ages have about dating but with particular poignant emphasis on seniors.
4,Funny Girls & Boys too!,"This film about lonely seniors is funny and touching. Brenda Vaccaro and Sally Kellerman still has their famous throaty voices and Dyan Cannon has lost non of her physical attributes although she did something to her face and lips reminiscent of the scene played by Goldie Hawn following her lip injections in the ""First Wives Club.""Joe Bologna and Rene Taylor are brilliant. Len Cariou is a convincing sad and lonely widower and Michael Nouri is sexier than ever.Boynton Beach Club"
2,Can Senior Citizens Have a Love Life?,"A rather cute little film about seniors and problems they encounter, especially the grieving process. When a lifetime partner dies, what are the chances for finding love again? Not too interesting for the younger generation."
2,Baby Boomer Movie!!,"Ugh, I saw this movie in the movie theaters with my mom, neither of us knowing anything in advance about the movie itself. My mom enjoyed the film, I for the most part did not. Granted the acting was great and the movie had some VERY funny moments...... HOWEVER, the storyline wasn't to my liking.Be forewarned, ""Boynton Beach Club"" isn't geared for anyone under the age of 50 years old! This movie is geared to the baby boomer generation and above as this movie deals with retired senior citizens living in a retirement community, death & bereavement of a spouse you've been with for decades, and re-entering the dating scene after being married to the same person for 30 years or more."
5,inspector morse-daughter of cain.,My husband and I really enjoy the Inspector Morrse Mysteries. It takes Your full attention to watch and try to figure out whodid it. It always has lots of twist to it. We enjoy the actor's and the scenery in the movie.It is nice not having lots of cussing and sex scenes in the movie.It is a great movie for the family.
4,Due North,I found the book to be extemely useful in communicating the 12 Leadership techniques and stressing the importance of each individual becoming a coach.I was familiar with a lot of the recommendations so I was able to glean additional insight on the subject of leadership by reading the perspective of this author.I found the assessment checklists found throughout the book to be helpful in reviewing my individual status concerning leadership.I would highly recommend this book to any individual seeking to improve their visibility in their chosen field.
3,Up Please...,"I borrowed this book from a colleague, who had it sitting in her library. What intrigued me about Due North were the words The Crystal Stairs Leadership Journey on the cover. I somehow immediately connected those five words with God.Ms. Foster has put together a comprehensive guide that will help some with self-awareness, being a coach, time management and many other skills to help you excel in leadership positions in Corporate America.The book is set up in two parts, the first is almost an introduction to her journey. Throughout each chapter you will find activities to help you maintain the information offered in the chapter.Once you have completed part 1, your journey has truly began.I enjoyed reading ""Due North"" it gives us the tools we need to go straight to the top, while making sound decisions."
3,BINSWANGER'S BEST,"Ludwig BinswangerBeing-in-the-World:Selected Papers of Ludwig BinswangerIntroduced by Jacob Needleman(New York: Harper & Row, 1967)Binswanger was a psychotherapist with existential leanings.Two of his cases are quoted at length in the chapter on anxietyin Our Existential Predicament.But much more will be found in this comprehensive volume.Another Binswanger case of angst quoted in the anxiety chapteris drawn from Existence: A New Dimension in Psychiatry and Psychologyedited by Rollo May et al. (New York: Basic Books, 1958)A few other similar books will be found here on the Internet:""Our Existential Predicament Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher."
2,Lackluster,"I am a fan of Sarah Brightman, but feel this CD does little to showcase her awesome voice and there is no particularly noteworthy track on it. I thought it strange that this CD was marked down within days of its debut at my local store. Could it be that the mediocrity of the production was so readily apparent? All that aside, who's brilliant scheme was it to produce an Arab-influenced CD at a time when American aversion to things Arab is probably more prevelent than it's ever been since 9/11?"
1,disappointing,"I have tried to like this CD since i am a great fan of Sarah Brightman . It is just disappointing . The songs are very forgettable for the most part and the ""whisper"" singing makes very little use of Sarah's incredible vocal talent and range ."
1,Harem,"As I listened to the title track I started to feel that I had wasted my money, by the time track 2 came along I was sure this CD was garbage that only the dogs in the neighborhood would appreciate. Anyone who buys this CD trying to get a taste of the middle east will be dissapointed. Attempts by Ms. Brightman to give songs that have nothing middle eastern about them a middle eastern flavor have resulted in failure. I laughed when I read some of the reviews where customers found Harem (the title track)to be beautiful. Actually the original song (Ms. Brightman so cleverly destroyed) is called ""Song of the Sea"" and is sung by Dulce Pontes on her CD ""Lagrimas"". The version sung by Ms. Pontes is so hauntingly beautiful it ended up on a Richard Gere movie called Primal Fear. Ms. Brightman should stick to what she knows and should stop trying to be so darn ordinary."
3,Disappointed,"I like the selections, but I have a problem with the quality of her voice. I prefer to hear her really going all out, rather than using what I can only refer to as her ""little girl"" voice; soft and quite breathy in spots.I'm really disappointed in ""Stranger in Paradise"". That's one of my favorite songs, and I want to hear it the way it was written. No screwing around with the lyrics or melody!"
2,Won't pass the test of time.,"There are some attractive features to this release: excellent sound, creative orchestrations, and Sarah Brightman in fine voice. Overall, however,I have the impression that everyone involved is just going through the motions. There were no songs or moments that gave me the urge to hear them for a second time. I have a lot of CDs I want to play repeatedly. This production is not one of them. In the next week or so I will be putting ""Harem"" in a box of forgetable purchases I keep in the basement."
1,Harem: as kitschy as the title implies!,"I'm sure to provoke the ire of die-hard Sarah Brightman fans (I used to be one!) but bluntly, I just dislike Harem! Sarah Brightman's forte is an ""easy listening"" bridge between opera and pop and she should have continued in that genre. Instead, Harem is a miscellaneous hodge-podge of styles with a strange dance club beats. Brightman's vocals are a waifish, high pitched warble that neglects to demostrate her vocal agility. I anticipated her CD for months just to cast it neglected onto the top shelf of my closet. If you're looking for a Sarah Brightman CD, buy anything but this one!"
1,Her worst CD,"First of all, I'm a huge Sarah Brightman fan. I have if not all but most of her CD's but I have to say with all honesty that this is her worst offering. I mean its downright terrible. Very disappointed and will be giving it away."
3,Harem A Forbidden Folly,"Sorry Sarah, You didn't make a hit with me on this endeavor. The tracks were over-engineered and were too similiar in tempo and instrumentation(a la driving bass disco).Sarah's vocals did not do her justice. Breathy and ""little-girl"" style just didn't hit the mark of excellence I expect from Sarah. Such a shame as her voice is a powerful instrument. I was hoping for a compilation that would rival or even surpass ""Songs That Got Away"" in which she shows her true range and versatility. Musically, the tracks were complex and I could appreciate the talent that was required to produce them and kudos for mixing Old World with New World. I won't let this release keep me from following Miss Sarah though, for she still has the voice of an angel (when she chooses to )"
4,New to Sarah Brightman,I'm very new to Sarah brightman's music and I enjoy this CD. I think she has an amazing voice. Very talented young woman and this cd was very relaxing and joyful to listen to. I like to learn and heard more from Sarah Brightman.
2,Disapointing,"I wish I had my money back on this one, and I'm a fan. I expect to hear that voice lift me, and sadly on this CD it did not. It is still good listening, but falls well short of my expectations."
4,Nice sound,"Bought as a gift for my husband. He enjoys it! A bit too ""new age"" for me and not really my style."
5,The Journey Home,Thanks ARR for composing such a wonderful track:The Journey Home..Coming with CD+DVD even more delightful for me to having it as my compilation..=)
4,A Major Kate Bush Fan who now enjoys Sarah Brightman,"My father was playing this CD the other day and being a major Kate Bush fan I was like, ""who is this Kate Bush Wannabe??"" especially on ""What You Never Know"". But putting my back down and really giving this CD a listen, I am completely blown away. I have heard of Sarah Brightman before and thought she was just a sugary-sweet vocalist with not much soul. But this CD has proven me wrong. I was first in love with ""Mysterious Ways"" and ""You Take My Breathe Away"" - the more upbeat tracks with Ofra Haza who is awesome! But now I'm in love with a couple slow ones such as ""What You Never Know"" and ""Beautiful"" which is absolutely beautiful. I still can't help but think of Kate when I listen to the slower songs but Sarah definitely has her own thing going on and I think she is amazingly talented. Very well done Sarah! I hope ""Harem"" does well here in the states! - L. Parham (which rhymes with Harem)"
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"I originally wrote a 5-star review extolling this Cd's virtues, but since then I just realized I have not listened to it...There's nothing I really need to hear again, nothing hold up...If you must spend $$$$$$ right now, buy Eden if you don't have it.. if you already do, pay a bill or go out and get a nice seafood dinner"
3,Stranger in Paradise - More Like Stranger in a Lost Cause,"I'm not throughly pleased with this album! This CD is only good if you know how to dance in a Middle-Easters fashion. About half of each track is dominated by all orchestrations and no Sarah. Plus, Pop-Sarah isn't really for me. I much prefer the Classical-Sarah. Some of the tracks are okay, like ""Harem"", ""The Journey Home"", ""Beautiful"", and ""Stranger in Paradise"". Really, this is a good CD for your collection, but I wouldn't listen to it on a 24/7 basis."
3,Disappointing,"I have most of Sarah Brightman's CDs. I enjoy her sweet, haunting voice, and I love ethnic music, so I was excited to find this one, but disappointed. I don't really dislike it, but the music is not especially memorable, and the use of synthesizers is overdone for my taste--just too saccharine. I don't think that I'll play this one too much--except perhaps in the background when I want to get on with something else without too much distraction."
2,"I wanted to like this album, I really did, but","it sounded to me like she was singing outside of her vocal range on virtually every song. Most of the songs I couldn't even finish the voice sounded so off key. Clearly I'm in a minority here, but I really did not enjoy this cd at all. It will be going to a used cd store by the end of the day."
2,Doesn't Stand The Test of Time,"I originally wrote a 5-star review extolling this Cd's virtues, but since then (only 3 months ago) I just realized I have not listened to it again...There's nothing I really need to hear on Harem, nothing here holds up like her previous work...If you must spend $14.00 right now, buy Eden if you don't have it.. if you already do, pay a bill or go out and get a nice seafood dinner"
1,Does she makes original songs sometimes?,"Just to help you.. From the album Eden, the song with the same name is from Hooverphonic, a great band you should listen. And if it wasn't enough, the song Beautiful on Harem is from a another band: Mandalay . Don't tell me she's making music, it's so easy to make covers like she do. And the worst thing is to sell is new album with others stuff. A Great Musical MAchine..Sounds like S**T..Best regards,"
3,Slightly disappointing,"I have all of Sarah Brightman's CDs. She is probably one of the best female vocalists in the world today, but this CD drowns out her voice with music that haphazardly changes from Arabic to pop tempo. Too bad she doesn't stick to the Arabic theme throughout the whole CD, and show off her powerful voice she is capable of. This CD is not her best. A little too much fluff when she doesn't need it."
5,..What A Wonderful World.. What A Wonderful Remix!!!!!!!!!,"When I first heard of Sarah's version of What A Wonderful World, it is definately one of the most beautiful song I had ever heard. I hated this song before, but Sarah takes the song and reinvents it to 'now'.. It sounded fresh as if the song was written yesterday!!! Loved it, though the music was sorrowful but it made me think of even though with all this 'war' going on right now, it made me think... ""What A Wonderful World!!"""
3,Come Back Full-Voiced Or Else,"No one loves Sarah Brightman more than I do, but if she continues this journey closer and closer toward pop music, leaving her full voice behind, some other chanteuse, like Izzy, will have to fill the operatic void that Sarah spear-headed so masterfully into the mainstream.""Harem"" is neither bad, nor memorable. I most love her deeper, grandstanding, supreme voice. ""Classics"" was the ultimate; the quintessential collection, which turned the page of that era, not for good, i hope. She was desirous of writing more original material, thus ""Harem"" was born...Fine, but couldn't she have sung it more operatically? Sarah I beg you: You needn't return to Puccini or Beethoven, just the voice. I disagree with Carlotta in ""The Phanotom of the Opera"" : Christine Daae does have the voice."
2,not the best,"I agree with ""music fan"" about this CD. Eden is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't terrible, but it's not very good."
5,Incredible Voice - Fantastic Sonds,Sarah Brightman continues her incredible career with this CD. I can listen this over and over again. I had the pleasure to actually see her in concert perform the songs from this CD. Amazing experience.
5,Harem LE Cd & DVD,Absolutely stunning and artistic dvd and a beautiful mix of music songs on Cd.I really love this cd and dvd set more than most of my opera cds I own.Sarah Brightman is one fine and rare artist who puts herself in every role she has to play.Her voice gets under your skin and from the foreign music instruments you get a mystical feeling in your home.A true musicfan of classical and soft sounds needs to own this.
3,"More Music, Less Brightman","I truly like Sarah Brightman. I think she has a spectacular, sweet, silvery soprano that soars beautifully. Unfortunatley, Harem was not an oppertunity for her to fully express her wonderful talents. A lot of it is ""fusion music"" and often you have to strain to hear her lovely voice. And her accent is odd; it's all blended and impossible to understand. thank God for the lyrics available with the CD! If you buy this, just know that it is not unadultarated Sarah, but a weird remix type thing that attempts to be exotic and sensual, but only succeeds in a few of the songs. If you want to listen to Sarah in action, try ""The Phantom of the Opera"" orignal London 1986 cast recording. I would reccomend checking this one out of the library first."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I buy music either to listen to, or to dance to. Based on the reviews I read prior to buying the CD I was under the impression that I would be able to use some of the tracks for my belly dance performances - not so. In my opinion the CD is certainly pleasant to listen to, but I was rather disappointed that it did not manage to bridge the gap between Eastern and Western music as competently as I had hoped for. There is, regrettably, no definite distinction in the individual tracks that would make any of them interesting for a performance in a field which continually searches for new, exciting and dance-able music. I look for traditional and non-traditional music which appeals to both a Western and Eastern audience (for example Sting's Desert Rose), and Harem fell short of my expectations."
1,Bad Attempt at Fusion and Singing,"About Eastern/Arabic Music Fusion: Not very well done at all. Entry level stuff. One song is a copy of an Indian movie song from the movie ""Taal"".Regarding Singing: Ms. Brigthman is just an average singer who sings in a muted voice which is covered up in the synthesized sounding music.Wasted $14 on this CD. Try Peter Gabriel - Last Temptation of Christ, if you want to hear world class fusion"
1,"Unfortunately, its bad....","Let me preface this by saying that I am a female vocalist affecionado and that Sarah is right there at the top of the list of female vocalists I rush to get new work from when if comes out. This one was bad...I agree with some of the other reviewers who indicate that this CD is all over the place. It lacks vision, coherence, and by trying to be multi-ethnic Sarah falls on her face. I know many think she is a phenom (and in many ways she is), but a middle east tonality she DOES NOT have. I one really wants to get into a frsh blend of Middle Eastern music and pop, just listen to someone like Ofra Haza or something, not Sarah...A good attempt however, but will appreciated by those who do not really want to delve into the voices of real Middle East...A C for effort."
1,"MAJOR, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!","Sarah Brightman is a phenomenal vocalist who's career I have followed since the beginning. This release is a scrambled-up, unfocused, peculiar effort. Her magnificent voice is definitely NOT suited to the material chosen. I think she may have gone off of the ethereal cliff with this CD. I will always love Sarah Brightman and appreciate her true talent but this HAREM release is shockingly poor for someone of her caliber. PLEASE, SARAH! Take a poll of your fans and I'll bet WE can suggest some incredible songs to which you would do justice!"
3,HAREM,"I AM a "" Sarah "" fan and have all of her recordings, videos, and have seen and heard her; more than once, in concert - Live! This CD just doesn't live up to he normal- "" Fabulous "" ! So I am a bit disappointed as I look forward to hearing her latest endeavors and newest...... But, I can see a CONCERT in the making and probably will buy the video when it is released. Kathy Young, Seneca SC"
1,What a waste of money.,"This album is ridiculous, the singer is terrible, and whoever really buys into this lady's interpretations know little about music. The production is obviously by an amateur."
1,It's Been Done Before by Better Artists,"For what it is (techno pop), it's not horrible, but, if you like the Mid Eastern-influenced/World sound, try ""Into the Labyrinth"" by Dead Can Dance or ""Duality"" by Lisa Gerrard or even ""Sunyata"" by Vas instead."
2,Lackluster,"I am a big fan of Sarah Brightman and have all her CDs. I think this CD has some of the best Music I have herd, however Sarah brightmans voice is very weak and just sounds like she is not interested in the songs. There is no punch, no get up and go to her voice. Seems all the emotion is gone. I only hope that if she does a video she puts more into it. This could of been really great."
3,"stick to classical, Sarah","She cannot sing anything but classical -period. When she tries to sing pop, she's awful--it's probably like tom Waits trying to sing a Bach Aria. She is a mechanical wind up doll who puts pooploads of virbrato on every single note she sings, and her canary little voice sounds just awful--very weak and thin. The album does have good songwriting however, which Brightman had very little to do with, aside from some melodramatic new agey innerself kind of horse doodoo lyrics she wrote. The biggest letdown is ""Beautiful"" which she butchers to the Nth degree--check out Mandalay's divine version of it--you will definitely agree with me. The middle eastern themes range from hauntingly beautiful to overdone and cheesy. If you like Brightman, stick to her classical stuff, where she's at home and should never stray from."
1,OH NO!,"Tisk Tisk Tisk.What happened? Sarah Brightman was one of two current english speaking artists that I would listen to. I stopped listening to Americam / English music because it all sounds the same and I'm not interested. I always looked forward to her new music even going so far as to order it from overseas. With this cd all I hear is really bad gay disco, none of the otherworldly sounds of her previous none ALW work. Eden, La Luna, Dive and Time to Say Goodbye can transport you to a place where all is peaceful and calm.This cd will be put away and most likely won't see the light of day again. I will still be a big fan; I know in some careers the will be a dud and to me this is hers. I do hope with the next one she returns to the sound of her previous none ALW work."
1,First-Time Disappointment,"As an ardent Brightman fan, I never thought I'd be so critical of her, but the timing of this middle eastern themed CD suggests a political nanabooboo aimed at both the USA and the UK.Perhaps a wiser choice would have been to postpone this theme until the whole world isn't hurting so. A low rating for this CD is all I can muster because of the poor timing of the theme.I've listened to the CD twice, and theme aside, I am disappointed in the vocals and the production. Ms. Brightman's whispery voice is sometimes overwhelmed by the demanding orchestra and combos. Mr. Peterson tends to prefer heavy-handed arrangements. I best stop, lest Ms. B write a review about me!"
1,"Sappy, hyped creation","Who buys this stuff? I cannot say that she has no voice, she does have a voice. I can say, however, that the overdone arrangements and the lack of character in her performance make for a silly fantasy with little to appeal to sophisticated audience."
2,"If you like EDEN, don't visit HAREM...","Sarah Brightman is my favorite vocalist without question. Her ""One Night in Eden"" DVD concert is her ultimate performance & best song selection she has to offer in one place.Brightman has offered many different styles of music, from Classical, Opera, New Age, and even Dance/Rock. 'Harem' doesn't fit anywhere, unfortunately.""Mysterious Days"" is a fabulous song. 5-Star in my opinion. But the rest of the album is below the high standard that Brightman has previously achieved.Where are her soaring vocals? Unfortunately, Sarah has fallen in love with those 'Little Girl' style vocals on 'Harem'. I love her uptempo ""New Age"" & Dance/Rock songs -- the ones where her vocals soar, such as ""Only an Ocean Away"", ""La Mer"", ""Captain Nemo"", ""Eden"", ""First of May"", ""In Paradisum"", ""Who Wants to Live Forever"", etc. Those songs really show off her voice.So, if you enjoyed EDEN, FLY, DIVE, or even LA LUNA (to a certain degree), you may be disappointed with HAREM."
5,Amazing Great Album!!,"I Love this Album Arabian & European fusion is amazing, Ms Brightman is a very talented woman and everything she touch is gold, AMAZING SARAH BRIGHTMAN.. every Sarah's album is a great sorprise!!"
5,Sarah Brightman at her best!!!!!!!,"Awesome is about the only word I can think of to describe this beautiful CD. Sarah Brightman explores an area of music that is so haunting and beautiful that the CD has not left my player since I bought it. I have enjoyed each of Sarah's previous CD's but I can't say the operatic songs were my favorites but on this CD every song is a favorite (there are only 2 real opera songs here but they are mellowed down with an Eastern beat) Her rendition of What a Wonderful World adds spice to (i think) a rather boring song. I really like the first song because it starts out slow and gets up to a fast beat. Arabian Nights is a wonderful 9 minute song that has parts to it and each part is distinctly beautiful. I recommend this Cd to anyone, it doesnt matter what your music preferance is."
5,Sarah Brightman's Harem CD,"I own most of Sarah Brightman's CDs. This one is my favorite by far. I am a fan of light and ethereal sopranos, Indian, Middle Eastern and club (dance) music. Harem has a combination of these elements. I also love the orchestrated background. This music definately brings me joy. My favorites are ""The Journey Home"", ""Arabian Nights"", ""Mysterious Days"", ""You Take My Breath Away"" and ""Harem"". I was very excited to hear ""The Journey Home"" sung by Sarah. I have heard the original Hindi version."
2,A catchier title than: Sarah Brightman:Wants to be Ofra Haza,"While not out and out bad, this is a rather uninspired album. I hadn't been familiar with Ms. Brightman before, but thought I'd introduce myself to her on this album. While I don't much regret it, the experience was dissappointing. As a revisionist of arabic music into western pop, Ms. Brightman does not match the vocal richness of Ofra Haza, nor do her composers manage to equal the brilliance of Peter Gabiel's ""Passion"" (Soundtrack to ""The Last Temptation of Christ"")For all that being said, the album is passably listenable, with some shining moments creeping in between otherwise forgettable techno-pop. If you're an insatiable fan of the genre, you should be happy with the album in your collection. If you thought Disney's ""Prince of Egypt"" soundtrack was brilliant, but needed a more Adult Contemporary edge, you'll probably think this is the best album ever."
5,Another masterpiece! Highly recommended!,"I loved this album right from the first listening! It literally took my breath away. Standout tracks were Harem, It's A Beautiful Day, The Journey Home and The War Is Over. I can just imagine the wonderful and fabulous remixes that will embrace the powerful songs such as Harem and It's A Beautiful Day. The only track I didn't care for was It's A Wonderful World and it was placed as track #2. If you have been a fan, Harem won't disappoint! I just wish she releases more quality studio albums like this than countless compilations."
5,Sarah Brightman's Harem,"Sarah Brightman has returned in a strong way. This CD is sensual and exotic, it carries an Mid-Eastern flair that puts you in another land. The title track is very well produced and a great start to the CD. She reproduces ""What A Wonderful World"" in a way that has given me a new appreciation for the song. ""It's A Beautiful Day"", ""Free"", ""Mysterious Days"", ""The Journey Home"", and ""Arabian Nights"" are a few of the great songs on this CD. I highly recommend this CD and give it ""Five Stars""."
5,Sarah:Angel Of Music,"I never knew or heard of Sarah Brightman until I saw her ""Eden"" video at a local Target store here in Houston Texas a few years ago. I was ""taken"" by the magic in the video and her angelic voice. Since then, I have bought all her cds except for the one titled ""The Songs That Got Away."" Every other reviewer has basically covered the greatness of this new release and Sarah's fascination with the Middle East. In this limited edition which also includes a dvd, I was somewhat dissapointed with the ""Harem"" music video;Sarah Brightman's lip sync was terribly off key and her hand movements was more or less candid. She more than makes up for it however in the alternate music video of the same song which shows her singing live in a record studio with the musicians etc."
3,"Very good, but a few complaints.","I just wish it had more of the Arab influences in the music, as the title led me to believe. I really, really dislike it when she attempts to incorporate that tech-pop style into her music. It especially sounds off blending with synths and Arabic singing. ""The War is Over,"" ""Beauitful Day,"" and ""You Take my Breath Away"" (particularly the pleasnt, beautiful arab style vocal performance in the middle of You Take My Breath Away) are the high points of the album."
5,More Fay Sweet,"Fay Sweet has authored a lot of remarkable modern design books. More Space is no exception. She has found, and photographed, some of the most interesting home additions I've seen to date - all of them unique. I especially enjoyed the basement and attic additions/expansions. This is not a practical how-to guide, it's a book about what's new and innovative in home additions."
2,No Drama,"I expected this video to go into the lives and games of the greatest womens players of all time, but it didn't. This video was more of an instruction video using these women to demonstrate how things should be done. It also dissected their best shot. There were very few highlights and no drama all in all a big dissapointment. The best part of the video was at the end when they showed little 9 or 10 year old Venus and explained that she could one day be a great player. It was funny because this is an old video, but this segment lasted maybe only 30 seconds."
4,Good book.,"If you like WWII thrillers with the good guys struggling to overcome long odds to defeat evil personified in the Third Reich, this is the book for you. I do agree with some earlier reviewers that the book takes a while to build up steam, but then it holds your interest, non-stop.The endearing character of Mouse goes through a change of heart because of the responsibilies thrust upon him and the love that he finds along the way.There's lots of action and suspense. Highly recommended."
4,Evocative WW2 Tale,"Gregg Keizer's first novel takes us back to the territory that Ken Follett, Greg Iles, and Jack Higgins used to explore so well in their earlier novels: Nazi-infested Europe. The Longest Night has no spies, just a guy nmaed Mouse, who is a Meyer Lansky employed hit man from Brooklyn, and who just happens to be Jewish. We follow Mouse on a mission to Europe in which he is charged with helping to liberate a train-load of Dutch Jews who are headed for concentration camps.The writing is very good,especially the description of war-time Europe, and the story is well-told. The only thing holding me back from giving this 5 stars is that the pacing is slow to build up momentum, and this kind of book should be more tense.I will read Keizer's next book, and hope he delivers on the promise shown here."
2,A fix for one problem,"We are big Maisy fans around our house. But I wish I had listened to the reviewer who said that the tabs and flaps are cumbersome on this book (and we've got dozens with which to compare it). Also, the story line just doesn't work. She's in winter clothes and takes them off to go swimming. I guess if she's going to an indoor Y... Here's a solution for the obvious problem though. So you don't have to go back through the book yourself to put the clothes back on Maisy before your child reads it again, just read the book back to front with your child and put her clothes back on. That actually makes the experience a little more interesting."
4,Maisy the Swimmer is Great,Maisy captures a child's attention. Maisy is going swimming. Most preschool children love to play in water. This book teaches children their colors and the names of articles of clothes.
4,What a great book!,"A fantastic Maisy book - my daughter (2) loves it. Not only do we get to read about another wonderful Maisy adventure - Maisy getting ready to go swimming but we help Maisy get undressed and into her swimming costume. It had really helped my daughter give her clothes a name and also which bit of the body they go on. This book enables you to help Maisy get dressed and undress by use of flaps and pull tabs - my daughter loves doing that as well. It has helped her understand the concept of on and off, up and down, and colours."
4,Great book!!!,"This book is one of my daughter's favorites. She loves manipulating Maisy's clothes over and over again for hours. Great overall book, but I subtracted one star for durability. It could have been made a bit more durable..."
1,Very Unhappy!,"The book I ordered was rated in good condition...this book was not in good condition.The flaps were missing or taped, the book was torn and in VERY poor condition. I bought this book to use in a center at school. I wasted my money.Maisy I will have to order another book, it is not in any condition to use in my classroom. I will never order a used book again!"
2,disappointed!,"My 4 year old daughter had her heart set on a vacuum cleaner for her birthday. She had picked out the red Hoover vacuum which really works and picks up small trash off of the floor but is a Barbie freak so instead of buying the Hoover, we purchased the Barbie one thinking that it would be perfect for her. Much to our surprise, it only makes real vacuum noises. It does not really clean. We returned the Barbie vacuum and purchased the Hoover for several dollars less."
3,Real Cute,I bought this for my daughter so she could get over her fear of the vaccum cleaner. Cute but sterotypical toy for female toddlers.She now vaccums alongside my house keeper and doesn't have a fear of the vaccum cleaner.
3,Connell's 'Most Dangerous Game' is abridged. Review contains spoilers for that specific story.,"I can't really say with any of the other stories, since I'm not as familiar with them. Maybe they've been abridged, too. Maybe not. But ""The Most Dangerous Game"" has been drastically cut. And it suffers for it. Nearly all of General Zaroff's exposition and back-story have been removed. This omission takes one of literature's most memorable villains, and turns him into a two dimensional stock character. Worse yet, the dinner scene no longer plays like a verbal sparring match, with Zaroff gradually revealing his plans. There's no suspense in it anymore. Now, it plays more like ""Please pass the roasted potatoes, Mr. Rainsford. By the way, I hunt people.""The three star rating reflects my disappointment at the editing of this particular story. ""The Most Dangerous Game"" is one of my favorite stories of all time. I'm deducting two stars for getting a gutted version of it."
2,This is not a follow-on from the Sawtooth,"A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain. The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank, and the Tigertooth does not. I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way, I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia. The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake. The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking. I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it."
2,Upper holds up well but the sole wears unevenly and way too quick,"I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them. Recently I figured out why I didn't, the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe. I've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years. While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes. I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this ""new version"". I'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck. Personally I can't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass..."
1,Can't watch it!!,"I received this very quickly, but I am unable to watch it on a DVD player made in the US. It appears this was made overseas and is not set to up play on equipment made in US. This DVD is no good to me and I am trying to return it."
1,Regarding Henry,"The movie was formatted to play on DVD players manufactured in Europe and not in the USA, therefore I could not view the movie. I sent an email to the vendor asking them to send me a different copy and they never responded. I am very very disappointed!!!"
4,I lived this film first then it was suggested I watch it,"I actually suffered a tramatic brain injury in 2004 and like Henry almost died as a result. It was tough for me to watch initially, like I was watching myself through a mirror. The film glosses over to an extent the difficulties of the physical recovery, choosing instead the emotional aspects. That's good you wouldn't want to watch 3/4 of the film set it a gym. Its only been recently where I've completely regained my memory, there's still a few month gap immeadiatly proceeding and following my accident. I could go on and on about the similarities, suffice it to say this is a very well done film and for this TBI sufferer was very rewarding"
4,A true feel good movie,"Harrison Ford plays a rich, self-absorbed lawyer who is shot in the head during a robbery (no, he does not suffer a stroke). His memory is completely wiped out by the head wound. The movie is about his struggle to learn about himself and rediscovering his family and the other things in his life that are important. It's a wonderful story that the girls will eat up and the guy can enjoy too."
4,Regarding Henry,Much over looked Harrison Ford film.Great script with Harrison playing against his usual action characters!Good job by Annet Benning.
2,Umm...WHAT?!,"Two stars only because the first 15 minutes or so is pure Harrison Ford brilliance. The rest of the film left me scratching my head. What is the message here? Insensitive workaholic-types are capable of an emotional transformation only if they're lobotomized? I imagine the original pitch went something like, ""Harrison Ford as ruthless lawyer gets brain injury and has to start his life over; the rest will write itself!"" Well, it didn't."
4,"Warm Blanket, Fire, and a Rainy day","This film is only good with three different ingredients: a Warm Blanket, Fire, and a Rainy day."
3,Lawyer Gets Shot In His Head - Becomes A Better Person,"Although the acting is solid, the movie is riddled with cliches. High-powered attorney Harrison Ford is mean and cut throat; he gets shot in the head during a botched grocery store robbery. (The hold-up man is John Lezgioumano (sorry about the spelling)and the only person of color in the film). The bullet makes him humanistic. Maybe the bullet is the hero? A good idea for a film is wasted on a mediocre script."
3,AT LEAST THE FILM'S HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE..,"A hotshot, hyper-workaholic lawyer finds himself in the middle of an accidental shootout, loses his memory, and lo and behold, his world goes topsy turvy. Quite predictably, as is the case with pretty much every scene in this feel-good Oscar bait, the man turns over a new leaf, becomes a good father, a conscientious husband and a decent human being. Yawn.The movie's slowly unfurling narrative and its high predictability levels could have made it a skippable fare, but Ford's rendition of amnesia is moving, and Annette Bening's performance is very impressive. An occasional saving grace is also the music, if you have an ear for that kind of stuff.Recommended rental."
5,A classic,I never see this movie being rerun on television. I always loved it and don't know why it seems to have been forgotten. It's very dramatic but filled with humor and love. I had my grandkids (age 10 and 12) watch it with me and they also loved it. They are starting to trust my judgment now when I bring out old movies.
4,Surprisely good.,"Regarding Henry was panned by the critcs but loved by audiences. This film is touching, straight to the point, and interesting from start to finish. This is still Harrison Ford's best performance and Annette Bening is such an under-rated actress, she is good in everything. Kinda shocked to find out this film was written by J.J. Abrams and directed by Mike Nichols. I highly recommend checking this hidden gem out, enjoy!"
5,No Ford fan should be without!,"This film is by far one of Harrison Ford's most compelling roles. Ford plays Henry, a high-powered lawyer who falls victim to a convenience store robbery. What follows is one man's heartbreaking struggle to regain control of his life. Henry must learn to walk, talk, and do the simplest everyday things all over again. Harrison Ford plays a very strong and convincing role in a movie that no Ford fan should be without!I hope you'll check this movie out. It gives us all a little more insight into the struggle many patients like Henry have to go through to relearn the simple things. Don't get me wrong and think this movie doesn't have a brighter side to it, it does!"
1,Made for UK DVD players,"This product arrived on time, packaged as stated. However, when finally we sat down to watch the DVD...SURPRISE, it will not play in any of the DVD players in the house, each time we received an error message that the disk wasn't authorized for play. Upon further investigation the DVD was intended for release in the UK, not USA and will not work here."
5,Regarding Henry,"Really good movie--one that can be watched again and again. As one who has experienced brain injury, the therapies and peoples' reactions are quite accurate. Life is never the same after a brain injury. Henry adapts well."
4,Regarding Henery,"I liked Regarding Henry , It showed a very true situation of a person dealing with a head injury. It was very real to me , Harrison Ford did a great job."
2,"Harrison Ford's worst film -- until ""Random Hearts""","I'm sorry to be the contrarian, but really, was there any scene or role in this film that wasn't totally predictable? The unhappy high-powered New York lawyer and his equally unhappy wife; the African-American physical therepist; the high-powered mistriss; the unhappy-at-the-boarding-school daughter; the poor plaintiffs in a civil case who get the shaft from the high-powered, unhappy New lawyers? The characters are recycled from other characters in the same film, for cryin' out loud. Show some originality. The only thing that makes this film at all palatable is the premise that if you shoot a lawyer in the head, it might make him a better person. But wouldn't you agree that the film is too long just for one lawyer joke?"
4,Resource Material,This book did give a concise yet indepth account of the slave trade in terms of the statistics. It is a great Resource Material for students doing research.
1,Do not believe the product specifications,I looked at the detailed product specifications and it said this product was backward compatible with PC100 as the title PC133/100 implies. This product did not work in a PC100 computer as another review also states. The company did not respond to two emails about the issue.
2,Computer cuts off with new memory,"I ordered 2 sticks of memory (512 MB) for my Dell Dimension 2300 to try to increase its performance. The installation for memory sticks is pretty simple and they appeared to be new and in good condition. After installing I rebooted the computer, but before it was fully rebooted, all power was shut off. I started the computer multiple times with the same results. I tried switching the positions of the sticks, placing only one stick, and using one of the new sticks with the old sticks...same results. I had a local tech come by to give me his opinion. He believes that either they're defective or noncompatible and should be returned. He also said that I should probably go with a more trusted memory maker like Crucial or PNY. I've reinstalled the old sticks and have no problem with the computer turning off. I've contacted Buy.com about getting an RMA for returning the items...We'll see."
3,"Close, but...","Julia Fordham can do no wrong in my book. I've rushed out and bought every CD on the day it came out since her debut. But she can do better than this. I wish she'd continued to mine the warm, R&B-influenced sound she and Larry Klein developed on "" Concrete Love."" ""Jacob's Ladder"" does exactly that--and it's one her best tracks ever. It has an excellent bassline that really propels the song. ""Perfect Me,"" though not especially funky, is classic Julia--delicate, thoughtful, and absolutely beautiful. But tracks like ""Downhill Sunday"" and ""That's Life"" just meander around and waste the considerable talents of everyone involved. And ""Sugar"" is flat-out snooze-inducing. The Amazon.com reviewer definitely got one thing right--if only the sound matched the T-shirt!"
5,Just Buy It!,"This is a great cd, one that you will not forget. The music is melodic and pensive and you can not help but be taken by it. I am not a huge jazz fan, but after one listen, I knew that this cd was one that would be a favorite in my collection for many, many years. If you have the opportunity to see the film, it is even more fun. But don't wait to see the film first- buy this cd. You will not be sorry."
2,Beware of this one,"I love Miles too, but this CD is mostly just sounds for the film plus a couple songs. You will hear a drumbeat and that's all for long stretches. In fact the excellent reviews for this CD are an ugly reminder of what wacky people walk among us. The song Generique, one of Miles' best ever, is here, but is best purchased in another collection. It's on The Essential Miles Davis, for example."
3,Pretty Good but don't believe the hype!,This Disc has gotten alot of Hype and so I got and Listened to It.and After Hearing it I wasn't Blowned away.It was Alright but Basically Miles just doing Runs.The Music doesn't go anywhere.Compared to His Period Stuff at the Time Of Cool this is just Warm-Up.it has it's Moments or Two but for The Most Part it doesn't really go anywhere.
5,Miles Davis Establishes' The Noir Sound,"Miles Davis, the king of all jazz, interpolates all the key traits of motifs of the existential film noir. You can actually feel the movie's mood and attitude through the cd, even if you have never actually seen it. Muscial mastery, Miles Davis at his very best. A must have for any jazz fan worth his salt."
4,"Gone are the ugly reverb fx, welcome to Miles original warmt","If you liked the movie and miles, it's a Must-have. The editing from the original tapes brought back the presence and warmth from Miles'playing. The booklet shows interesting comment about the going of the session. The only thing that is a little disappointing, all takes from the same song follows, it could have been better to put it in some more wild order to prevent from tiring."
1,don't bother with this book,"I can't imagine anybody charging money for this book. The only things it presents about Netscape Composer are what are immediately obvious to anyone that tries it. The nitty gritty about how to dimension columns, etc. and how to make Netscape do what you want it to do are totally missing."
3,"Yeah, okay ...","It's okay ... nothing to write home about (why I'm writing here instead), but there's some fun in here ... my problem is fun gets olds fast for me.But READ it anyway, amici ... it won't hurt you to read ... maybe don't buy it, but read it one way or the other. If I rate something lower than a three, it means I could've spent a few coins more wisely."
4,"Fascinating, if simply too small for a figure so large","Very interesting, if somewhat frustratingly limited documentary biographyof Winston Churchill. It's not really the film's fault. It's well made and intelligent.It's just that Churchill lived such a full and fascinating life, that trying to jamit all into an under 2 hour film means that much has to be ignored or sped through.So in most areas we get the condensed version. Only the war years get a littlemore detail. But we get almost nothing about Churchill the human being, the husband,the father.Huge changes in his political career are handled with a few sentences and a couple of images.Yet I was never bored, and still ended up knowing much more about both Churchill and Britainin the war years than when I started.A worthwhile film that spurred me on to learn more."
2,No positive effects,"I ordered this hoping to increase my energy and desire to work out. I read reviews of the product at other sites which were mostly positive. I saw some complaints about taste and loss of sleep. But, mostly the reviewers said that they made gains in size and strength. They claimed an increase in sexual potency as well. So here are my opinions.Pros:The taste kind of reminded me of real maple but not sweet.Cons:I did notice some sleep difficulty but it went away if I took it earlier in the evening usually after eating.I did not feel more energetic. I did not have any gains in size or strength. I had no difference in sexual potency.So, it did not work.I gave it two stars only because ""hate"" seems a pretty strong term. The definition of 1 star is ""I hate this product.""I say spend your money on a good whey protein."
5,A practical and focused plan for success.,I am a motivational book and tape junkie. I have read and listened to hundreds of books and tapes. This book is outstanding. In just a few short weeks I developed a new success habit that I have been trying to implement for years. This book is awesome and the simple but powerful techniques work.
1,Telephone Theory Principals and Practices,"This book was first copyrighted in 1973... and has not been seriously updated since. It covers cross bar, step - by - step, and other ancient switching systems. It would be usefull to those people that are required to maintain a very old system. Perhaps third world countries still use this stuff."
4,"A ""Must Have"" for any serious rocketry enthusiast","The 7th edition of this great handbook is getting a little ""long in the tooth"" now, but it is still essential reading for anyone who wants to get into model rocketry, regardless of whether you're main interest is low, mid or high power rockets. Of all the books about model rocketry that I own, G. Harry Stine's handbook is the best value for money."
5,"After All These Years, Still the Best","The late Harry Stine is owed by all of us model rocket enthusiasts, active and (like myself) inactive, a debt of gratitude for the work he did to make model rocketry safe, and, more importantly, legal.While in the end Mr. Stine was not in synch with the average model rocket enthusiast (which were going into high powered rocketry) he was still admired by all for his contributions.If you want to find out the basics of model rocketry, up to a discussion of the then emerging (big time) high powered rocketry, this book is your bible. Carry it with you if you want to know about engine sizes, stability, recovery devices, everything you need to know to shoot your rocket into the sky and bring it back in one piece (I should add as a side note that rockets that go bad are kind of fun to watch, but really hard on the makers nerves)."
2,Intro to Kit Buying?,"This book has a lot of background information, but doesn't tell you how to build a rocket. Scratch building is deprecated. Turns out the author owns a rocket model kit company. My teenage son was very disappointed."
4,Mystery and Love,"Inspector Morse shines in this film, as always. There is a slight twist at the end, and we have a rare glimpse of romance for Morse. The main characters have complicated love lives which all seem to intertwine and make the story very interesting. Morse is his staight-forward self, staying focused and solving the mystery at the end. very good viewing."
5,One of my favorite books,"Some people object to Vicki Hearne's writing style (smart girls can be annoying). Others feel her training methods were too harsh. But Vicki Hearne knew a great dog, and how to write about one. Be warned: This book is politically incorrect and may make you do something really stupid, like adopt a pit bull. Vicki Hearne is, after all, the one who said, ""It is true that Pit Bulls grab and hold on. But what they most often grab and refuse to let go of is your heart, not your arm."""
2,The ultimate pit bull defense that most pit bull people are too illiterate to read,"Hearne's beautifully written book is, oddly, never referenced by people who loudly defend the 'fighting' breeds of dog from scrutiny. Hearne was a skilled and charismatic writer who can almost sell the utter malarkey that pit bulls have been unfairly maligned by 'the media' and 'hysteria.' But apparently, her complex, elliptical writing style and fascination with philosophy are a 'downer' for people who just want outrage stories about beaten dogs and biased media outlets. How very revealing."
3,"Not that bad, but not that great either","I started reading the book with quite high expectations, and at first these were fulfilled. However, after a while, Vicki Hearne's personal opinions of dog people and the world in general becomes uninteresting and at times even annoying. It would help if she stuck at least a little bit more to the subject matter, the story of Bandit and the problem about dangerous dogs in general. But instead, she glides off into philosophical thoughts which nobody really wants to hear about anyway and trying to convince the rest of the world about the viciousness of the media and politicians. Still, it was a nice, but different attempt to the dog-bites-person problem."
4,Off white bear,"This bear turned out to be more off-white or creamy colored instead of white. Since I ordered it to make a ""ringbear"" for my wedding in August, it was kind of a big deal that it's not white. Should be in the description. If it was going to be used as a regular child's toy, it would be perfect."
5,Excellent festive margarita salt!,Not much to say....except that this salt rockz! We love the festive color and the salt is high quality and perfect for rimming glasses. Highly recommended!
4,Quintet III,I bought this from Ebay brand new for only about 359.00 dollars. What's nice is that even at a low volume you can hear a full range of sound. High end sound for a low end price. I'm sure if you have a very large living room you can stick all four speakers in the rear for 7.1 and buy a pair of large floor Klipsch speakers for the Front Right and Left. Perhaps a larger center channel if you're more than 10-15 feet from your screen. For my apartment living room these are perfect though. As I run on I should also mention that the built wall mounts are awesome! You can tilt the rear speakers inward if your couch is against the wall.
4,Great Speaker Great Value,"I have a 10 year old pair of Klipsch floorstandings for my living room and I love them. Thus, when I was ready to complete the sound system for my new projector based home theater, I was looking for an affordable way to set up a surround sound system. The price was right but my biggest concern was the possible lack of lowend punch due to their size. Based on my audiophile friend's recommendation I paired the speakers with a good quality 10 inch HSU sub. Using my Denon reciever with the sub crossover set at 110 hz, I dont feel that I am missing anything either for movies or music purposes. My audiophile buddy (who has a $5,000+ speaker set-up)was even really impressed. Sure there are better speakers, but based on the price, you would need to spend substantially more to begin to realize any significant sound advatages."
5,Synergy 5.1 surround sound system quintet III,"These speakers rock! Small, easy to install, and totally rock the house. I paired these with a polk audio sub and its absolutley amazing! Zanns is the Best deal period!"
4,Excellent sound for price and size!,"Great sound, good price, good size. I haven't used them as much as I would like so far, but they were a huge upgrade from what I had without spending ""Bose money""."
4,These speakers sound great.,"I've only had these speakers for a few days, but, they sound great. I have a pair of Klipsh tower speakers in my bedroom and was thinking of getting some bookshelf type speakers to get some room back. So, on a business trip to Chandler Arizona, I went into a Best Buy store there and came accross these speakers. After listening to them I decided they would fit the bill for my bedroom. I also double checked with a sales person on the price because I found it hard to believe they were on sale for $224.99...which also helped in the decision to buy them.As I said, they sound good, but, I do plan on adding a sub-woofer in the future."
2,2.5 stars; not to be confused with Neal's book w/ same title,"As the leading civilian authority on the Secret Service, I modestly recommend this 1957 book by Ferdinand Kuhn (pen name?). This book is not to be confused---as I and others have been---with the 1971 Grossett and Dunlap book of the same title, written by former Secret Service agent Harry Neal. As for this book, it is dry and dated, but it is worth it for a few items (and the foreward by former Chief U.E. Baughman).Vince PalamaraSecret Service expert (History Channel, author of 2 books, in over 40 other author's books, etc.)"

1,Fooled!,This book was advertised as a hardback book and it was a soft-covered book. I was really disappointed.
5,Excellent historical fiction,Roberta Gellis has done it gain. One learns more about life in medieval times from her writing than any other author. She provides an attractive and plausible heroine and hero. She teaches the reader history in the most painless fashion and is painstakingly accurate in her details.
3,Different,"I did not like it as well as his other books, but still entertaining. I would certainly buy more of his books."
3,book,"this book was a little too scary and not too realistic, for me. I will try to find another of Ketchum's books, to see if I might like a different story."
2,oddly familiar?,"Read the book and found it decent. Sadly cant recommend as a favorite in the Ketchum line. If you want to see a film, which was very enjoyable to me, based around a similar plot watch the British film ""Doghouse"". At least that made me laugh because of the jokes. This book made me laugh when I think I should have been frightened. Guess the whole intro stating it as too graphic to publish was due to the fact of the year it was supposed to come out. Its pretty tame in my opinion compared with some other novels I have read. Just my two cents."
4,"LITERARY ""B"" HORROR MOVIE","I don't quite understand the harshness and negativity towards this book. This is, after all, a Jack Ketchum novella. If you grabbed this and meant to get ""The Good Earth"", I can see your confusion. I enjoyed this book because I believe I took it the way it was intended- as an over-the-top, mindless excursion into a independent horror movie. This is ""Night of the Living Dead"" with an updated location and a plot twist. This is not Jack Ketchum's deepest, best written, most thought provoking work. It is a fun, wild ride through one night in a city gone to hell. A good time if you allow yourself such indulgence."
1,Zero stars is more appropriate,This book is awful. Even Friday the 13th looks like a masterpiece when compared to this piece of trash.
2,Not quite what I expected,"I honestly have to say I am disappointed with this item. It is a German style helmet. It is wrapped on leather, but that's about it. I cannot even begin to understand how this company would expect a true biker to wear this thing. I took it out of the box and it looked like I put a painter's bucket on my head. I know I ordered the right size because the fit is accurate and it definately is not just my opinion as my wife shares my sentiments. The DOT on the back of the helmet also appears like a regular sticker was just slapped on it."
3,good but not a miracle,"I loved how this stuff smelled, but I kept mine on for about two hours before I rinsed it out. Nothing different happened with my hair. It did not super moisturize my hair, nor did it dry it out. I think its a bit costly and requires too much time for nothing to happen. I will keep using the one I have but after that, I doubt ill make another purchase. It got great reviews though, so im sure it works on some people but not on others. I have very thick, straight hair."
3,"All Hail The Queen, But What Happened To Her Other Songs?","Gal Costa's voice truly is a gift of God. She is definitely one of Brasil's greatest singers and has given the world so many great songs that are certain to sustain the test of time....But with that in mind, be aware that although this album is fairly decent, it does not include many of her greatest hits, like ""Bahia de Todas"". I was also a little disappointed by the fact that this album seemed overwhelmed with ballads, rather then being an equal balance including many of Gal's wonderful uptempo songs. It's truly a shame that this album was not as well balanced as it had the potential to be. But from my experience often times it's hard to find a true ""greatest hits"" album by any artist, that delivers ALL of their greatest work. The only way you might be able to get that lucky is if a greatest hits compiliation comes in a box set."
3,Bird: Original rcordings review,"Overall I thought the CD was C-. It shows the eclectic nature of Bird's talent in the early recording days. The aspect that gets to me most is, once again, how incredibly ahead of his time Charlie was. His riffs and improvisational style are so far advanced compared to the musicians of the day (except for Miles) this CD is worth the price of admission. I bought it used and that is the only way I would buy this CD. In other words the level of recording from a technical aspect does not warrant buying this CD new."
2,Looks nice but didn't last,"I purchased this as a baby shower gift for my daughter and after only 1 year of normal use it has fallen apart. She contacted the manufacturer and they were of no help to her. At the least they should have offered a discount on a new one. For the amount of money that this cost I would think they would have better customer service, and their products should hold up better than this one did. I am very disappointed in this product."
2,It wouldn't let me register...,"Hi,I have installed lots of software, but Red Shift 5.0 has me stumped! I tried on-line to register my SN, but it keeps giving me a 'error'. Also no email support! I tried there on-line web support,but it said my probelm did not fit a certain creteria so had to just give up. I might add I can run the program if I use the CD each time, but since I couldn't register I now won't be able to update any of the comets data, etc. I had expected better!Wally.."
2,Buggy Software,I tried to use this software in a school setting and it simply would not work for long. I got the same error message as others have gotten. If it was reliable it would probably be an excellent educational reaource. Too bad.
1,Want to really understand contemporary issues of race? DON'T read this.,"Basically this is neo-conservative propaganda disguised as neo-liberal scholarship, in my opinion it is not helpful if you want to develop a full understanding of the role important race still plays in America...it basically dismisses that it matters anymore, an argument that unqualified talking heads are fond of but that pretty much every other credible academic that has any expertise in the issue has dismissed."
4,The American Streamliner : Prewar Years,"This is a great resource book for your railroad library if you are interested in the streamlining era. If, like me, you custom paint model trains, then this book is even more important because of all the color photos it contains. Serious use of color film was a rarity (due to low ASA numbers when compared to black-and-white) during the steam-to-diesel transition era, so I appreciate the nice collection of color photos included in this book. Coverage of any particular train or railroad is not exhaustive, but there is enough included to get you started. The text is well written. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I look forward to volume II - Postwar Years."
2,Be prepared to explain racism to your little scientist!,"The Microbe Hunters relates in breathless and enthusiastic prose the stories of the great heroes of microbiology. If you buy this book for your budding scientist, however, be aware that the author shares the racial and social biases of his time and class (mid 1920's). As a result, the many chapters set in Africa are marred by language and attitudes towards Africans that most contemporary Americans would find very offensive. So, be prepared."
5,This book changed my life,"It's simple: This book changed my life. I became a microbiologist because of this book, which I read when I was in junior high school. Still relevant and easy to read today, it is extremely well written. Easy enough for a 10-12 year to read, yet it does not dumb things down to the level an adult would find insulting.I made a gift of a copy to my best friend's daughter, who is going to school to become a microbiologist."
5,One of the best accounts...,"I read it when I was a teenager. I still find it perhaps the best account on the early microbe discoverers. Chapters on Van Leeuwenhoek (first thing I did when I arrived in Holland was to look for his house, in Delft...), Spallanzani and Pasteur are masterpieces in itself. Hard to put down."
3,Microbe Hunters,"It's a great book, but dated. The publisher would do de Kruif a favor by taking out some offensive racism."
4,"Fast read, dated writing style","De Kruif initially copyrighted this book in 1926, and the writing style shows--enthusiastic and somewhat corny. It also includes some racial slurs that pop up out of nowhere--standard for the time, I'm sure, but startling and offensive nonetheless.Despite this, the book is a fast and interesting read, and provides a good deal of color for scientists whom most of us previously regarded as dry and distinguished. I don't know how much liberty he takes in building these characters, but I will now never forget Leeuwenhoek.The book ends with Paul Ehrlich in the early 20th century, so the past hundred years of infectious disease research obviously isn't covered. It's definitely a fun look at the history of science and disease, however, and I recommend it for anyone interested in the topic."
2,Be Aware of the Racism,"Because so many eminent researchers point to this book as an inspiration, I was excited to read it. I was quite disappointed that the author is more than just a little racist. In the text, the noble white man saves the ignorant black, brown and yellow man described by the most vulgar of epithets. De Kruif may be a man of his time, but the attitude is nonetheless disturbing. I was also surprised that for an otherwise scholarly approach, De Kruif uses the words virus, bacterium and microbe interchangeably. I would definitely *not* recommend this title for children."
1,Worst book i've ever read,"I was forced to read this book as a summer assignment in my high school this year. It was not a pleasant experience, it took me so long to finish the book because it was so boring and my mind kept drifting off to something else."
1,Spoiled by racism,Remember enjoying this book as a child so I purchased it for my 9 year old. Read it over first and was shocked by the blatant racism in the book. Would not recommend the book without a lot of crossing out or a lecture on racism first.
1,Summer Reading,"I agree tiffanyaou@hotmail.com, this isn't that great of a book for kids (especially to read over thesummer). I mean if you like to read books that have very confusing words, go right a head."
4,A comprehensive guide,"A good step-by-step guide. If you're trying to understand this practice better, this book will help you providing many insights to this profound practice."
4,Alright,I really liked all the songs in this movie. They weren't used exessively and flowed with what was going on in the movie. The only problem I have is that the song that's playing when Julie is walking under the bleachers isn't on the soundtrack. Does anyone know what this is?
5,fantastic!,This book is a riot! I never knew there was so much - and so varied - sex going on in a garden. I hated botany in school because it seemed boring. But reading this book was so much fun - it made learning interesting and downright hilarious. The pictures and illustrations are fantastic and funny too. I'm not even a gardener but I loved reading this. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to have a some good clean/dirty fun and learn something to boot. It also makes a great gift - I gave it to several friends and they all thought it was fantastic too!
4,Worthy Addition,"""Walking to Vermont"" is a worthy addition to anyone who collects, reads, and enjoys books on the culture of walking. I especially enjoyed it because it is also a worthy addition to literature related to the Appalachian Trail, and sits on my bookshelf besides Bryson's ""A Walk in the Woods"", Emblidge's ""Appalachian Trail Reader"" and Hall's ""A Journey North.""This is not a book of discovery -- Mr. Wren knows who he is and is comfortable in his own shoes (but perhaps not his socks). The story reads like both a narrative and a memoir, as Mr. Wren recounts events and stories collected in a life as a foreign correspondent.Fans of the Appalachian Trail and of the literature associated with it will be very familiar with the themes: trail magic, trail angels, trail names, and the wonderful people that make up the hiking culture.I have been to the Hanover Ben and Jerry's and have never had a ""White Blaze."" I will protect my source on who informed me about it, however..."
5,The begining of life,"Living the vicinty of NYC, i am always amazed at the people i see every day. It has been a dream of mine to conquer the AT. But for a man in retirement, to due such a venture, is an inspiration. The authors ability to bring his past ventures in to simular standing is also a great asset to the books adventures. We all want to know how it comes about."
5,Two for the Price Of One,"Two classic George and Tammy releases on one disk. I enjoyed the heck out of their chemistry together. It is easy to see how they performed so successfully together for so long, in spite of their tumultuous relationship over the years."
3,It's okay,"Loved ""The Long Hard Road Out of Hell"" however this one not so much, Its almost as if I am readying a book report on the road out of hell."
5,Factory Original and good price,These are very common filters to a lot of different mowers but I live in a rural area and they are hard to find.Glad to find a fast affordable source.
5,"Came quick, works fine",only thing is the plastic could be less resistant to dirt...but thats creative.....
4,Stephen Coonts just keeps on giving,"Having read all of the books featuring Tommy Carmellini I decided to go back and read the books that started the career of Jake Grafton and this one just keeps on giving, back from the dead, not just Jake by the ""Toad"" also and the ending was not what I expected, twists and turns that made me keep on reading.Being a big fan of Coonts, ""Deep Black"" series, etc I highly recommend ""Minataur"" because it gives you an actual feel for the pilots, how government and it's leaders, using that loosely, bicker over tax payers money not for the good of the country but to bring back the ""bacon"" and get re-elected.This gives a a good insight to the Navy, Stealth planes, Russian feelings in the 80'and how government, military personnel and even civilians looked at the world.SixtoOviedo, FL"
5,happy with the purchase,I am very happy with this purchase. It came in good condition and will go perfect in my library.
4,Vague and confusing,"The book is really good, exept for the fact that it is a bit to complicated. Also, the way Coonts explains things is very vague, and confusing in the way he explains who each character is."
4,Extremely enjoyable read,"I very much enjoyed this high-tech (which is not quite up to Clancey), detective, spy thriller. Coonts does a great job of personalizing his characters (and here, I think, better than Clancey). This was the first book I've read by Coonts, and it was great even out of order for the series. I'm very happy to see that readers think there are better books by Coonts out there. They must be very good indeed."
4,Review of the Minotaur,The book was hard to follow at times but it kept me in suspense right up to the end. I gave the book a four star rating.
4,Good Jake Grafton story.,"I am so glad this was written because of the ending of the previous book. At least this book explained what happened. It is a dirty trick to not finish the previous book making you buy this book to get the ending. This is a spy story again. Less action adventure, and more spy thriller."
4,SKYKOG's Review of Minotaur,a good read.. not as much on flying as Coonts shifts to the foucs on intelligence/ spy type book. I am a pilot myself and very versed in law enforcement and firearms so I enjoy the mix in Coonts novel. Final Flight may be the best of the grafton series so far. Minotaur was much better than Under Siege
3,An endurance test,"I got this book through a Kindle daily deal. Although I'm not an avid fan of the long running Jake Grafton series, I'd enjoyed the couple I'd read and figured the price was right.Reading this 25 years after the original publication makes it feel more like an historical novel. Stealth technology is new and exotic. Spies stealing documents copy them onto 5.25"" floppy disks. Not even the first Gulf War has occurred yet. It's all a little nostalgic. However, the age of the book isn't what made it a chore to finish. It was a plot primarily centered around the political mechanics of new weapon acquisition (in this case a navy stealth fighter). Coonts is a good writer and the portions with some action and suspense were very good, but weapon acquisition is a boring process no matter how adroit the author might be. The book would have been too long even with a more interesting storyline, so I consider finishing it an accomplishment."
5,"This is the Genie award winner, isn't it?",One of Alpha's CDs won at the Canadian music awards this year. I think it was this one. Definately worth checking out.
3,You better really like Basketball,"It was an interesting to look at the world of elite prep basketball players and to get a glimpse of a few of them before they reached the professional level. The production values are done on the cheap and you never get a full character study as they try to cover a lot of ground. You feel the passion that some have for the sport and this league and you hear how important it is, but I'm not sure I ever really felt it. An interesting artifact for those into basketball in all it's forms."
3,.,"It's almost hard to believe that this kind of film, so focused on the livelihood and future of a couple of teenagers, could actually ignore emotion completely. A very important topic, not completely neglected, just not focused on as much as I thought was necessary. I just thought it numbed how much emotion is actually put into these basketball players' games. From what I perceived from the film, basketball was most likely going to be these kid's main means of support. So what was to happen if they lost? Without the emotion of the players how are we supposed to relate to the film and genuinely understand how much basketball means to them? Not a complete miss, the characters were well explained otherwise, with statistics and coach support, also explaining how competitive High School basketball is. As a documentary you are allowed to get so personal with your subject, which is something the film COULD have accomplished easily."
5,Uber Postmodern Sensory Bliss,"If you are seeking a true diversion try these string quartets by Coates. The magical and unusual sounds Coates creates (I have no clue how she does this or how this music can even be written down on paper for that matter) all come together to paint an eloquent picture. Suddenly, you find yourself whisked forward and back through time and space. These are the sounds of nature from other times and places both past and future. And remarkably, these quartets are here for us to enjoy in the present!"
3,Not my style,Hard to review a comedy CD. It's OK but not my style. Mild British BBC humor from 1965.Each person has his own taste. You may like it.
4,Highly favored,I enjoyed the project. I previewed in on TV and was quite impressed. Thanks for sharing your ministry of song with the world.
4,The Original Bad Co Anthology,"Paul Rodgers was and is the KING!! Just saw him again inAtlanta and as always, he did not disappoint. The anthology album is great. So is Amazon.com!!"
3,Missing SEVERAL gems - could have been MUCH better,"Where in the heck are some of their other best songs? One of the best (if not THE best) songs they recorded was LIVE FOR THE MUSIC, which is not present on ANTHOLOGY. Some other great missing tracks include: SIMPLE MAN; SWEET LIL' SISTER; CRAZY CIRCLES; GONE, GONE, GONE; LONELY FOR YOUR LOVE; ELECTRIC LAND; PAINTED FACE. With a total running time of less than 138 minutes on ANTHOLOGY, they EASILY could have added just about all of the above tracks, and even left out some that they did put on ANTHOLOGY. Do like I did and copy all the remaining tracks on their first 6 CDs, that are not on ANTHOLOGY to 2 CD-R's and file next to your original of ANTHOLOGY. Now that is a great collection..."
3,"""10 From 6"" has all the hits PLUS ""Electric Land""","The single-disc10 from 6has the major Bad Company hits PLUS ""Electric Land,"" one of their strongest songs. Come on, folks...how do you start with TWO CDs as your blank canvas and exclude a song as strong as ""Electric Land?""This collection was a bit of a reconciliatory gesture among the band members...Paul Rodgers, in particular (after years of a Rodgers-less BadCo cleaning up on the tour circuit) made a lot of noise about the purity of the ""original"" band. So how did he follow up on that?He did theIn Concert: Merchants of CoolDVD and CD with Dave ""Bucket"" Colwell on guitar in place of Mick Ralphs and Jaz Lochrie on bass in place of Boz Burrell.So much for principles. And don't even get me started on the Queen thing.Get ""10 from 6."" It's all the Bad Company you'll ever need, and it costs less...""all killer, no filler."""
3,not bad tracks but bad selection,well yes their are many great tracks on here and filler like the new garbage plus they could have filled both cds and given extra music the set is missing the greatest song they ever did and a biker fav the way i choose from the first along with young blood live for the music anna electric land and others so for the fools who put this together go to the drawing board save your money and get the black cd and run with the pack and the other original cds like burning the sky
1,DISSAPOINTING,"What a dissapointment......the new songs are just re-hashed third rate copies of old songs. SHAME ......just goes to show that ""old musicians don't die .....they just make box sets"" !!!!"
1,Never again,"I could hardly tell what this CD was when I got it because of all the stickers on the case, one which said property of Clevland Library so for all I know it was ripped off from there. The case wouldn't close right so I had to take it apart and put it back together right. I haven't even listened to it yet because it looks like it is scratched all up and I'm scared to put it in my CD player. I won't be ordering from these guys again."
3,More Filler Than Anthology,"I was excited to hear about a Bad Company anthology, because as a major classic rock band (whose roots came from the ashes of Mott The Hoople and Free), the ""10 From 6"" package was really minimal. But this package, while adding a lot of good music from the band's history, also omits several key moments of their history, inexcusable in my view for a 2 CD Anthology. Key omissions include ""Leaving You"" and ""Everything I Need"" from ""Burnin' Sky"", ""Gone Gone Gone"" from ""Desolation Angels"" and ""Electricland"" from ""Rough Diamonds"". Fans will argue over the quality of any of those songs, but omitting them entirely - and not leaving the favorite choices to the fans - is giving this band less respect than it deserves. Hopefully, a re-issue will clear this up, eventually!"
3,missing some things,"I dont mind some filler on double anthologies,but when great songs are kept off for the filler theres a problem.1. electricland 2.gone gone gone 3. sweet lil sister 4. weep no more 5. jive talkin ( just kiddin ) all in all a pretty good double."
5,Almost Complete!,"Very good collection. Would like to have seen Don't Let Me Down, The Way I Choose, Young Blood, Gone Gone Gone and Electricland. I am a huge fan, but I don't think the original band would have converted over to the video age very well, so they quit just in time."
3,Needs Better Remastering...,"Nothing wrong with the songlist but this set disappointed me with its mixing. I found it very flat and lacking THE PUNCH needed to kick a**...I gather that the original Bad Co. masters were not in tremendous shape, but if Jimmy Page had stepped in and helped to remix the old Bad Co. as well as he remixed Led Zeppelin - this might have been stunning stuff. But that would have probably taken some time. I'm almost tempted to say go seek out the vinyl and enjoy that...I hope someone somewhere will find a way to improve this mix. Nice booklet though."
5,Hear the development of the voice of a young Elis Regina,"The sound quality is not allways very good, specially the older recordings. It's specially interesting for those who want to hear the development of her fantastic voice over the years since the sixties."
5,great,"Note to Amazon, the best songs on this CD are in the second half, which you do not let customers listen to, you only have a few songs at the start of the cd activated. You should try to pick the songs that sound the best or activate all of them.R Browne"
1,English book,"I bought this book thinking even though its a used book everything is in there, and I was wrong. I got this book and pages were missing. I'm very upset because this used book costs 43 dollars and I should have just paid an extra 5-10 for a new one. I also have to use this book everyday so it sucks!"
3,Nice book but I think she is sexist...,"It is a nice book but a lot of the lessons in them are pretty biased against men, it's kind of funny, but also annoying"
5,This is what the world needs to hear,"""This book really shows what the war on terror is really all about. It is a great reminder for the world that freedom does come at a heavy price, but is well worth it in the end."""
4,the sunbird,The Sunbird It is an exciting archeological dig that really makes you feel as though you want to be there.
3,The Sunbird,"Avid Wilbur Smith fan, but this novel was not one of my favorite...to much arbitrary comparison of current and ancient characters to maintain realism."
2,"Great story, awfully written","This book contains an excellent story based on a very clever idea (the parallel lives). However, this book reads like a cheap romance novel at times, one of the lead characters is extremely handsome and brave and strong and .... Another is an extremely beautiful woman, the other a phyisically deformed genius. Some of the dialogue made me wince - the constant references to the Lo's handsome features, the constant references to doctor Kazin's intelligence.I will definitely not read any other of Wilbur Smith's books!"
1,Misogyny and typos,I bought the kindle version of this book and couldn't be more disappointed. As a I wandered my way though the typo-littered text I was astounded by the blatant misogynistic attitude of the book. The female characters of the book are constantly described as childish or child-like and must be guided by the greater expertise of the men.I've read many of Wilbur Smith books but I was seriously disappointed by this one. Not only was the editing for the kindle edition exceptionally poor but I am not interested in reading a book that lacks any serious female lead while the two male leads are busy showing off spectacular feats of strength at every turn. The characters are under developed and the plot is unsurprising and boring. I wish I could return the item but unfortunately that option isn't available for kindle books :(
1,Only Wilbur Smith book I could not finish,"I've read several WS books but by the time I got to the second half of the book, I gave up. The story went nowhere.Suggest the Seventh Scroll or Birds of Prey, much better."
4,Eerie and entertaining,"I've recently re-read ""The Sunbird"" after many years, and found it just as terrific a read as ever. Without giving away any plot points, what got me the first time still gets me, the well-executed parallel stories, modern and ancient. The charge of racism voiced by several reviewers is perhaps understandable, but one has to keep in mind that the book was written at a time (the late 1960s) when the kinds of events described in the ""modern"" section of the story (tribal Africans taking up arms against descendants of white colonists) were common. I didn't find Timothy Mageba a one-dimensional caricature, but a complex and conflicted man who finds it necessary to sacrifice personal loyalties for what he believes is a larger good. Anyway, I don't want to make the book sound like a Poli Sci text, it's a fast, entertaining read, full of intrigue and romance, and eerie enough to make your hair stand up a little at times. Worth a read."
5,One of the best in my collection,"I have a 1st edition of this book and have read it more than 10 times since the 70's. I wish I could articulate the impact this book has on me each time I read it - perhaps after the next reading! By the way- the cover on the current reprint, although taken from one of the events in the book, totally misrepresents the story line to any potential reader."
5,Predictable but engrossing,"This book should be purchased with an eye toward Wilbur Smith's strengths as a writer and not as a literary piece. Smith's works are entertaining and adverterous, but little else. His characters are fully developed, but hardly plausible, as well the plots in his book. Think of his writing as a fun trip to an amusement park like Disneyland. The ""Pirates of the Caribean"" was not intended to be believed, but simply to entertain the imagination. Little more than an afternoon spent escaping reality. So too, this book."
3,Sunbird,"A page turner from the very beginning, another fine book by Wilbur Smith. You can feel the excitement and be swisked away to the times and places the novel is set in. Historical adventure at its best."
2,WHAT FOLLOWS IS MY TEN CENTS.,"I bought this book because it looked really good. I was mistaken. The story is okay, but the grammar, punctuation and sentence structure is terrible. There are commas where commas shouldn't be, there are no commas where commas should be (creating hard-to-read run-on sentences), there are numerous instances where semi-colons are miserably abused or used incorrectly (some where colons should be, some where commas should be and some where nothing should be).Overall, I think the author should take a serious look at basic writing techniques. He should buy ""The Elements of Style"" by Strunk and White.I must relent, however: The story is intruiguing and DOES move quite nicely. The plotline is good and could be very engaging if the above mistakes hadn't been made. I give my full respect to the author for keeping me enthralled, despite his many grammatical errors.If this author had a really good editor, this book would be a VERY, VERY, VERY good book."
4,Another winner from this duo...,"A bit short at 37 minutes compared to many CD compilations which add bonus tracks, still the quality of the music here is hard to match anywhere. This is uniformly lively, and ""Autumn Leaves"" is hardly recognizable when compared to jazz treatments which take it slower. I still like their mellower collaboration, ""We'll be Together Again"" even better, but not by much. While Sonny Stitt has had a longer career than Gene Ammons, I think the tracks laid down by the two together are likely to be superior to anything either did alone. Good jazz, good driving music, keeps you awake, makes you smile...what else do you need?"
4,Info for Samuel Chell,"For Samuel Chell-The album you like is called ""All Star Sessions With Sonny Stitt"". I have a review (four stars) on Amazon, if you are interested.All Star SessionsI've now heard this album, and it's outstanding. Not as wild as most bebop, but a very energetic session, and a good listen. Might be a good choice for modern jazz neophites. Very short CD, however, with no bonus cuts. Fine sound quality."
5,Outstanding!!,"This movie touches everyone who watches it. Some may not admit it but you sit through it without being touched you are dead or numb. Steve Martin is super as Jonas Nightingale, definitely an academy award performance. My personal favorite moment is the little comical dance he breaks into in the middle of his sermon. It always breaks me up each time I watch it and I have seen it many times. It is one of those movies you never seem to see enough. Liam Neeson is also great as the sheriff who is skeptical of Jonas and tries to bring him down. Everyone knows how great Debra Winger is and this one of her best efforts. A must for every serious movie lovers library."
4,This video is completely underrated,"With a cast that contains not only the wonderful Steve Martin, but Debra Winger, Liam Neeson and Meatloaf as well, this video is full of humor and explores the ""other"" side of traveling evangelical shows and the impact they have on the communities they visit. Even if the story wasn't great the gospel music that scores this flick makes the video worth the money!!"
5,Entertaining with great music. Very thought provoking.,"This film bears repeating viewings, revealing a new layer of meaning each time.Martin's performance is one of his best--funny and energetic, but this is no shallow role played just for laughs. The subject of faith is explored thoroughly here, but, as in life, there are no easy answers. Although Martin's character, Jonas Nightingale, is a con man of the first order, is God working through him? Even though he may have no faith of his own, he touches the lives of ordinary people, strengthening their faith.Jonas shows us some of the tricks of the trade in manufacturing ""miracles"" for the gullible, but when the real miracles happen, some tough questions are raised.Some have criticized the ending as being weak, but I'm glad the viewer isn't handed an easy answer.If you return for repeated viewing (as you probably will), you may find yourself examing your own faith."
5,Great movie for both believers & non-believers,"Wonderful movie with great performances from the whole cast, especially Steve Martin. It's not meant to be a fast movie, but rather an uplifting one. It's Steve Martin's best non-comedic role, and he was perfectly cast."
3,Worth Watching for Steve Martin + Great Soundtrack,"With an A cast explores faith in relationship to con-artists, skeptics, and true piety. Although worth watching for the soundtrack alone; with a blend of his trademark stand-up and brilliant acting Steve Martin steals the show playing a consummate cold-reading religious New York showman stranded in a small town in Kansas with his partners in crime. True miracles begin occurring in the town forcing the crew to re-evaluate their morals."
4,"Too bad, it's not aviable on DVD.","This film, truly made me laugh, I was laughing all the time with this one, but this film has also it's ""sweet side"", this movie it's not only a criticsm against ""pastors"" who cheat, it's also a test if you believe, this movie it's truly very funny and very beautiful, TWO VERY ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS WAY UP!"
4,Steve Martin is a joy to watch,"Steve Martin is a joy to watch in his portrayal of a religous charlatan preying on the gullible. Leonard Maltin's criticism of his performance as ""not credible"" is off the wall. Martin hits the mark, carries the movie with convincing charisma."
3,Ripoff of Elmer Gantry,"An okay movie, but watch Elmer Gantry and you'll see they ripped it off. But I always thought that Deborah Winger was hot."
5,One of my favorite movies in brilliant HD quality picture and sound,"I love this movie and it message, it has always been one of my favorites. Since this is not available on Blu-Ray, I decided to buy it streaming instead and I could not be happier!"
1,Leap of Faith,"I received the video WEEKS after I purchased it for a friend from out of country who was visiting at the time. When it finally arived, I removed it from the packaging and discarded it thinking when I visited the country in the next few months, I would take the video to him. Meanwhile, having never seen the movie, thought I watch it but when I tried, I doesn't work. No picture at all. I would like to return it but no packaging and I am not a happy costomer!"
1,Junk!,"Purchased this movie from ""Movie Mars"" what they fail to tell you is that zone 2 movies do not play on DVD players in the U.S. what a total waste of money."
1,hmmm let's see,I was very excited to order this video for my son but became very disappointed when it would not work at all.I won't order another video online.
1,Screwed !!,"This DVD was sent by a company called Movie Mars and it is coded to play only in Western Europe, South Africa and Japan. This does me no good since I live in The United States of America. When trying to play the DVD, a message was displayed, ""cannot be played in your region"", so I'm stuck with a DVD I can only watch on the computer. I sent a message to Movie Mars through Amazon,(you cannot contact them directly)asking about a replacement or refund and still have not heard back from them after 2 weeks. I will not be purchasing anything from Movie Mars again."
5,Interesting addition to my collection,"I realized recently that I had nothing from Cesar Cui -- who was a founding member of the ""Russian Five."" So I acquired this CD so he would be represented. It's interesting piano music and well performed. Most of Cui's output was Russian art songs. He didn't write in the larger forms of symphonies or concertos, so this is probably as far as I'll be going with him.If you're missing Cui in your collection, this is not a bad addition and it is eminently listenable."
4,Great,"Pretty good game. Graphics in Allied Assault are older, but the expansion packs are excellent. I would also recommend the Multiplayer part of either Spearhead or Breakthrough. It's a really fun game and I highly recommend it to all WW2 buffs, and Video Game buffs."
5,action filled!!!,This games is the best game ever the leval are fun and you can play forever on online mode overall I gave it a 5. Write when i got it I played it all night. You do NOT NEED a suprecomputer to play.
5,Medal of Honor Warchest,This product was shipped to me very quickly and arrived in excellent shape. The product was in brand new condition in the original manufacturers packaging just as it was advertised. I received overall excellent service from Amazon. I will definitely use this service again.
2,I was bored and on an airplane!,"The back of the book, which I purchased at an airport promises a love that can make dreams comes true and talks about the consuming passion of Pierce. If I hadn't been stuck on a plane and had nothing to do, I would have happily left this book in the airport club or the hotel wastebasket. I would not have wasted my time reading it.It is very hard to get wrapped up in a story about the two main characters when their only interactions include meeting at a school for a few minutes and several quick visits to a skating rink. Less than 20% of the book is devoted to them. And while the story of Giselle and Garek is somewhat interesting, way too much time was devoted to them. There really was no plot. Just conversations of Giselle and Garek. Even the characters mentioned in the beginning of the book, Val, Edward, Melissa etc. melt to nothingness by the end. My first Stone book and certainly my last."
1,Major Disappointment,"Being a Katherine Stone fans for years, I had high expectations for this book. I was extremely disappointed. I knew the ending by page 50, character development was poor and much of the character dialogue was confusing. Two love stories evolved and a missing person mystery solved in less than 300 pages. Characters were mentioned at the end of the book that I didn't recognize (due to lack of character development). Ms. Stone's books were always a guaranteed buy for me in the past. However, after reading this book, I will think twice before purchasing another one of her books especially at a hardcover price."
2,disappointed after many winners,I eat up everything Katherine Stone writes. I was truly disappointed in Island of Dreams. It is not up to her usual standards - perhaps written to fast? The characters are wonderful but not enough character development. I would love to see more about these characters in another book. . . .
1,Not a keeper,"I was very disappointed in this book. Katherine Stone spent too much time explaining and narrating. The story obviously couldn't stand on it's own. There was no development of passion. As soon as the characters Pierce/Liam meets Anastasia he is ""suddenly"" in love with just a short conversation. As soon as Giselle meets Garek she opens up and tells her whole life story. Where was the magic? Anastasia is always just ""cold"". I liked that there were actually two romances but that just left more explaining and narrating. I like much more interaction between characters. No action here and NO steamy love scenes to be found. Save your money. This is definitely not one I will save to read again later."
1,A bit disappointed,"I've been a Katherine Stone fan from her first novel.... and have so looked forward to each new release. This book, however, was extremely disappointing. I felt as though Ms. Stone has discovered a ""formula"" and just wrote this book to fit the formula. Man meets woman - one or both have tragic pasts - they fall instantly in love - and basically the rest of the book is padding. The story was disjointed, and I felt the characters were ""forced"" on the reader, and instead of letting the reader ""get to know"" the characters and fall in like with them. This is not one of the romantic, spell-binding, touching stories Ms. Stone is known for."
1,very disappointed,"I am not a very picky reader. I like anything that is written well. This book was not. The shift from the present to the past was not done well and left the reader with guessing games to play. The summary on the back of the book makes you believe that there is a bit of magic and mysticism to the book, but that is not the case.The characters are likeable characters, but the author should have focused the story on the interesting ones, Garick and Gigi rather than Anastasia and Liam/Pierce. I was intrigued when I saw the events that led Liam to become Pierce, but it had no bearing on the actual story.Such a shame-- this book had potential but blew it. This was my first Katherine Stone book and likely will be my last."
2,every which direction,"I was extremely disappointed with the new book. I waited patiently for Ms. Stone's book and it is as if she has thrown in information from every direction, barely tying it together. I found myself putting the book down over and over. It is almost like someone else wrote this latest novel. I was impatient with the whole mishmash of story lines."
2,Couldn't read the whole thing,"I usaully love Katherine Stone books. However, this one was terrible. I got to page 100 and realized I was wasting my time. I didn't think it was written well and I found it hard to believe that Pierce fell in love with Ana after one meeting. I will think twice about buying another Katherine Stone book. Her earlier works are far superior."
2,What Happened Katherine?,"Ms. Stone is one of my favorite authors and I have read every novel she's ever written to date and have enjoyed them all immensely but I am sadden to say I was quite disappointed with Island of Dreams.I made a good decision when I decided to wait for paperback edition after reading a brief description of it in ""PW"". There are too many missing pieces in the storyline to make it work. This story could have and should have been good one but Ms. Stone left out a lot information which would have made it an interesting read. Sorry Ms. Stone ""Island of Dreams"" just didn't do anything for me."
3,"Good, but not her best","A good book, but not Katherine Stone's best work. I enjoyed it, but there wasn't the character development, and the ending was very obvious before halfway through the book.This wouldn't be a good starter book for new Stone readers; I would recommend her earlier works first. You'll appreciate this book if you enjoy her works, but I doubt it will be a favorite."
3,First Time KS reader,"This was the first book by Katherine Stone that I have read. I have read one other since I first read this book and have read this book a second time since then. (about 6 months ago was the first time) I definately disagree with the other reviews in the fact that I didn't consider it boring. No it is not an action packed sit on the edge of you seat book. But, it is a good read in my opinion. It has kind of a calm story line, gradual and not too suspenseful (sp) It is one of those stories that you go aaahhh how sweet. Maybe a touch on the corny side but I read it twice and liked it. I don't usually read books twice either. Would I recommend it? Well if your looking for suspense and action then no. If you like just a sweet kinda fairy tale tyle story then yes."
3,Island of Dreams,"This was an excellent story. Ana as well as all of the key characters had their share of hardships to overcome. I love happy endings.However, the story revolving around each key player should have blended better. I found the reading a bit choppy.The story was excellent, Katherine made it easy to just love Ana and Liem, Gigi as well as Garek. You will find yourself praying things will work out for everyone. The blending of each character could have been smoother."
1,Confusing and Boring,"I assumed the book (on tape) would be a love story from reading the back cover. The story is more about different characters lives than a romance. Mabe I found the story confusing and boring because the reader was horrible! I kept hoping that each new tape would be better and more interesting, but it only got worse. This was a real waste of my money, save yours."
1,One of the most terrible products,"This is an absolute piece of junk. I tried all kinds of shoes on it, nothing stayed. DO NOT BUY, EVER"
3,not as good as ready to rumble...but a start.,"good but not great,but it does have hillerios characters"
5,"Really, Really, REALLY Good!","This book, like the first edition, is a truly excellent review of basic concepts in Transfusion Medicine, with enough advanced concepts and details to satisfy pathology residents studying for board exams. Dr. McCullough has gone out of his way to produce a book that is as current as can be, reads easily, and is just plain stuffed full of practical and theoretical information! An added bonus is that since Dr. McCullough (a former editor of the journal TRANSFUSION) authored all but one of the chapters, the book does not suffer from the uneven writing that damages too many Blood Banking books. He is a terrific writer, and this is an outstanding book."
5,Essential Training,"There's something about trains. Like rivers they embody past, present, future. If you're outside, they go by. If you're inside, the world goes by. William Brotherton does a masterful job of bringing the reader inside the massive probe into the hinterlands of the Dakotas through to Montana; stories of places and characters that relatively few humans have experienced or even thought about. Well-written and with a child's eye for adventure, Brotherton's somewhat picaresque novel deserves acclaim as a study of the strenghts that make up our railroad men. To the reviewers who complain about the salty language......I guess you weren't there."
4,Quirky french calypso!,"Karl Zero does it again. Another fun album. Although not quite as much fun as ""Songs for Cabriolets.....,"" I enjoyed this one too. If this album does not motivate you to dance, you have no pulse. Fun, fun, fun."
3,Teenagers,"This entry is worthy as a good mystery, but not up to par with what we have come to expect from this series. Our usual topping or icing which usually is opera, non-operatic classical music as well as romance - and to a lesser extent literature and art, cannot be found. And because of this, other ""filler"" material is substituted - in one of the featured roles the character could be eliminated without any effect on the plot whatever. However we do learn some very interesting information relative to Morse's teenage years.Now the curmudgeon finds it extremely difficult to deal with drugs and rock, without alcohol - he just cannot comprehend our youth in such an environment. In an interesting aside he calls Lewis by his given name ""Robbie."" This is worth a view, but is well down the list of Morse episodes."
5,Evergreen of evergreens!,"I think the first edition was in the 1800s, and very little revision since. It has everything needed to make a good clarinetist, except the actual clarinetist has to do the practice! This book belongs with ever clarinet player period."
3,Good but not great,"Like someone on here already said this album is very diverse. Some are totally awesome just like the years previous to this but others keep you wondering.... what the? But I do recommend getting this ablum even some of the songs that arent that good are listenable, but believe me there are some songs that are awesome like 'Damaged' and 'One More Time'. And I'd like to say that this is really the last Rych ablum you should own because the other ablums dont sound like them at ALL."
3,Jumping the Shark....,"This album was, at the time, a great infusion of the Ryche at the very point when Corporate Amerika was taking over the music scene. Queensryche tried very hard to mesh with what was popular on the radio and didn't do too good of a job at all. Promise Land has some very strong music and lyrics, but for the most part, it feels alot like the producer and the the label tried to take every good song from every album and reinvent it, which was disastrous for the band.I really tried to like this album, and there is some really good music and lyrics, but in the end, this is the swan song for Queensryche....With Promised Land, they jumped the shark and never looked back."
4,A little slow shipping it out,"I ordered several cd's and this one took the longest to get to me even the location was the closest. But the most important thing was that it was in great shape, so I have no serious complaint."
2,Was not a good follow up,"I finally played this all the way through after 12 years. and found that it's actually not just a bad collection of songs, but also a feeble attempt to do another ""Operation Mindcrime"". I guess the group felt since the show of the same name had moderate success that they'd try another, but the songs for the most part were not strong enough, and in a time when heavy metal was obsolete, and the music world was in mourning of the grunge scene after Kurt Cobain's death, so the musical identity for rock was in limbo pretty much, and this was not a good offering. I don't know if anything could've been considered a good follow up to ""Empire"" because in order to do so the group would probably have to reinvent themselves."
1,music to fall asleep to,"All I can say is that this album put me in a coma. It's so boring! It was painful getting through the whole thing. For a band that rocks so hard on everything prior to release an album of nothing but slow, sleep inducing music is a shame. I know it's experimantal and Geoff Tate was trying to be all artsy, but the only thing this CD is is a bad imitation of Pink Floyd."
4,Better than Empire,"You have to give this album a chance.Its not like Empire that has the catchy songs that immediatly grab you like Jet City Woman,Empire,Silent Lucidity,etc.....When I first bought this album I listened to it once and didnt take to it.A few years later I revisited it and is now my 2nd favorite Queensryche album behind you KnoW what.There are no fillers on here its just a solid album all the way through.Bridge,Dis-con-ected,Lady Jane... Good stuff.I thought Promised Land was the weakest song on the album,its not a bad song,but if I skip a song its the only one I skip.This is the last great thing Queensryche has done.This band absolutly blows now big time.Its a shame that they have to keep playing Operation Mindcrime to draw a crowd."
4,Another polished Queensryche album,"While you could rename this to ""Music to kill yourself to"", I did find the album to be ridiculously polished and produced. It's not a bad thing, really, because it fits the theme. It's classic Queensryche moving out into yet another frontier, and worth a listen."
3,Mixed Bag But Contains Some Winners,"It was nice to see Queensryche back after a four-year absence in the year 1994, which was very light on metal. Unfortunately, ""Promised Land"" is a mixed bag, where Queensryche attempted to modernize their sound at times.The opening song, ""I Am I"" and the unlistenable ""Disconnected"" show that they have taken some wrong turns when they don't stick to what they do best, but Queensryche can be forgiven for trying to evolve, since after all, they are a ""progressive"" metal band.Fortunately, when this album is good, some of their best work ever is a result, such as the masterful ""Bridge"" and ""Damaged.""For the record, Geoff Tate's baritone from ""Silent Lucidity"" returns for part of the song ""Lady Jane"" and they introduce acoustic piano in their songs for the first (and maybe last) time in their career for this album."
5,Full Package!,"This is a great disc! The performance is fantastic, the sets and costumes are superb... There is a great mini-documentary included... Really worth having! The sound of the orchestra is great, while the singers should probably have been mic'd... But it doesn't really detract from the whole package. Highest recommendations."
4,"Great writing, lousy editing!","Keith Hartman is a national treasure--I love his view of the near-future, I love what he does with characters, the details and sly cultural references make 2025 Atlanta feel very real to me.There are some frustrating things about this book, though. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are plot threads that get brought up and just dangle, forgotten about. There are also typos every three or four pages, and the font size keeps changing--who proofread this?!?"
5,Great,"I graduated college in January and have been looking for a job since. Finally, after purchasing this book I was able to EASILY find a job and write a ""knock- out"" resume. I am now a broker with AG Edwards. I would strongly recommend this book. I tried the job search web sites, and I got fast and easy results. They really fit what I wanted to do. If anything the books websites are worth the price! This is a must book for ANYONE looking for a job. I can't believe I've written this much about a book..... I guess it was just that great."
3,"Memory, every little bit helps...",There were several tips that I incorporated into my classroom lessons and in which students benefit from. Love the subject of mnemonics and this little book is a nice addition to my school library hoard. It is with great pleasure that I watch kids improve their memory training and have success in areas previously not reachable. Highly recommend the the book.
3,Intersting,"I went to highschool with Scott, and have been kept up to date on his memory powers. This book is very easy to read. Scott has a gift for narrative writing. As for the effectiveness of his techniques, I can't really say if they work for me or not. I have a very good memory, so a lot of his suggestions were not really useful to me. The Roman Room did not help me, as I have a great eye for detail. Scott provides a lot of charts and a way for the reader to implement the techniques. But since he is an engineer and thinks with the mind of a scientist/mathmetician, they were a little too technical for me and made me stress!"
4,All the Dirty Laundry!,"Seutonius did the world a great service when he wrote his ""The Lives of the Twelve Caesars"". This was one of the first primary sources that I read, and it remains a favourite of mine.Seutonius tackles each of the first twelve Caesars in chronological order, with a section on each one. He claims he has used many sources, and has even included some hearsay or otherwise unconfirmed information. He certainly was not shy about airing their dirty laundry.Unlike a lot of ancient authors that get translated into English, Suetonius' style is very relaxed and very easy to get absorbed into. Even in translation, the book maintains a brisk pace and has enough to keep one interested until the last page.Suetonius' ""The Lives of the Twelve Caesars"" is a fascinating book, written with access to sources long lost to us. This is a great book to read and enjoy, simultaneously being good for those interested in serious study of the period."
4,A classic,"This book is wonderful and MUST be read by anyone interested in Roman history. It's focused on emperors life, reported annedocts and facts.Just beware: not all the facts are considered to be true."
5,unsure,"I've been researching cameras, this one sounds like a good find. Sadly, there aren't that many reviews for it. I want a camera that has good zoom and is quiet. The ""Spy Camera"" comment definately pushes me toward this item. Still looking..."
4,varied outcomes,"I bought this camera for my trip to South Africa. I got some amazing shots. Very crisp and clear with brilliant colors. It's very quiet which is good but also pretty bad. It's hard to hear the thing wind so if you press the button and then move the camera, your pictures could easily be messed up because you didn't wait long enough- some of mine did unfortunately. So other than this set back, my photos came out excellent."
3,Problem with red eyes,"I love this camera for ease of use, and crisp, clear pictures. My biggest problem though are red eyes. I use the red eye reduction most of the time and eyes are always red. Maybe someone has a suggestion to fix this problem?"
1,"Cheap construction, flash burned out after few months of use","I purchased this camera after extensively reading the online reviews here and elsewhere. Everyone seemed to love this camera. It did take ""decent"" photos, however, it was poorly constructed, the ""automatic scene recognition system"" freaked out my wife who could not tell what the camera was doing. She ended up ignoring the flashing red lights in the view finder. They were quite distracting.The camera does not remember its settings after being turned off and then on again.The built-in flash turned black after only a few months of use.Finally, we took it on a hike, my wife had it in her hand, and lost her balance. Barely tapped it (with her hand reciving most of the blow) on the ground. Now it won't turn off and the lens shutter won't close.It is a basically a pile of trash now, and not worth the $188 that we paid for it.I'll think twice before believing on-line reviews and/or before buying another Minolta."
2,DIED,"my olympus c-5000 died exactly a year and 10 days after owning it. I didnt use it that much and it worked fine, but when i started using it alot about 2 weeks ago, the thing died and when i charged the battery it still didnt work, then i gave it one more try and it started beeping loudly and i smelt burning rubber coming from my camera! it fried after about a year of owning. never buying olympus again"
2,not so happy,The IR remote doesnt work. Everything else is as descrbed. Shipped quickly and arrived in time. Also had to purchase a separate memory card.
1,Crapola,Bought this camera and it died on me 13 months afterward. Not covered under warranty. The CPU went out and they want $150 to fix it. My local camera shop says they can't do the work here and that it must go to Olympus. NEVER BUYING OLYMPUS AGAIN.
1,Low quality...Don't buy!,Very poor quality slow tracking of the image even in day light conditions! The colors are extremely dissapointing..(...)I'll never buy anything from Olympus anymore.. I wonder how these guys get away with this crap?
4,"Great for outdoor shots, poor indoor focusing","This would be the perfect camera for most, if only it had a focus assist light. Noise if very high for indoor shots, epecially if you leave it on auto. This is a camera that requires you know alot about iso, focusing methods (such as spot focusing) and setting the contrast (this camera uses a contrast focusing system). The less light you have, the longer it takes to focus. Shutter lag is excellent for daytime, outdoor shots, and much slower with low to moderate light. Due to Olympus using a contract TTL system, adjusting the contrast to -1 really helps, as well as setting the metering to spot. Also setting the sharpness to -1 helps with noise. A flash is a must for indoor shots, provided you can get the camera to focus lock. A bigger xD card is a must...The 5060 is a much better camera, but costs $...more."
5,The Wiz Review,"Play It Again is a great book to read. The 7th grade is putting on The Wiz and madison chickens out. So she decides to be the backstage manger. When she sees Fiona and Poison Ivy hanging out and having fun, will all of her friends keep her down????"
4,Good listening,This is a very good purchase for the wonderful voice and songs I can listen to. The disc had no problem and was like new.
5,Made a grown man cry,"I don't know what was more entertaining: watching the video, or my husband crying while he was watching it. Eighty-six years of waiting made this season so much sweeter. This is an excellent gift for anyone in Red Sox Nation."
3,There is only so much you can do in one DVD,"I watched this immediately when I got home with this DVD. I was a little disappointed. I understand that there is only so much you can do in one DVD, still I feeling so many dramatic events were either skipped, or flatly presented. I would hold for a more detailed DVD package if there is going to be one, so I can relive the most amazing turn around in baseball history."
1,Ugh,"One of the most boring World Series. Whoop de doo, overpaid Red Sox sweep Cardinals in 4 games!After a terrific come from behind win against the Evil Empire (Aka Yankees), the ""cursed"" Red Sox go on to the World Series to face the St. Louis Cardinals who had the best record. I was rooting for the Cardinals (not a fan of them) but didn't really care who won. The series was not exciting at all, and this DVD shows that. One of the most boring World Series. *Yawn*"
1,Can't do this subject any justice in 80 minutes.,"I have not seen this video, but did see the video MLB just released (via download) of the 2004 ALCS alone, and they barely did that series justice in 60 minutes. Whether this ""Faith Rewarded"" video is 60 or 80 minutes long, how do you possibly do justice to an entire miracle season in that timeframe? This must be designed for that St. Louis Cardinals fan who wants to get the storyline over with quickly. (PS, the MLB video of the ALCS has huge quality problems as well--caveat emptor)."
5,What Can You Do in the Sun?,A sweet look on the beauty and power of the sun. Contains excellent color illustrations and will be of interest on the Kindergarten level.
5,Book arrived in excellent condition.,We bought it for a neighbor who raises many types of flowers and she was very pleased. It's a beautiful book.
3,"No Osbourne, Margera",Amazon lists the Osbournes and Margera as part of the actors in MTV Cribs-Rock. They are not in this DVD.
3,edited,I know Travis and Tommy's crib episode were both edited and didn't show the entire episode. Kind of a rip off. I would not pay more then a dollar for it.
5,Must Read,"Great book,lot's of wisdom for rebuilding your lost energies. Ancient Eastern knowledge that is just starting to gain acceptance in the west."
3,Not 'like new',"When it says 'like new', I expect it to be like new. There are 4 typed pages, the table of contents, on plain white paper and pasted over the real table of contents pages. It cheapens the book. I bought it as a reference book for my library so I didn't want to take the time and cost to return the book. If I had bought the book to give away I would have been angry and would have had to go to the trouble to send the book back. I won't buy from this vendor, deeleebooks again."
2,Incomplete information,"This book is a great description of what could be done, but the tools to do it are not herein. I was hoping this book was going to have more than just herb descriptions, alas it does not.Some things that the Author forgot and which seem important: dosage for individual herbs (this is pretty important), chinese name of herbs (neither the pin-yin nor the symbol are given). And, in the formulas section (which was the main reason I bought the book) the formulas just list the herbs and not their proportions! WHAT!?! How unhelpful.To know that herbs are in a formula is great, but it is not a formula without the proporation of ingredients. Although this book has great descriptions of the herbs and their uses, it lacks the implementational aspects which are critical to using the herbs! The truth is: this book is a marketing tool for the Author's herbal supplement line. Be careful..."
4,sammy and the count,"Davis is probably one of the most talented singers in American popular music, quite often showing significant influence of jazz, just like his pal Sinatra (although I like Sinatra more, Davis is obviously a far better singer).However this teaming up with Basie's band didn't amount to as much excitement and pleasure: Basie's band is being used as an ordinary back-up orchestra...This is still great popular music with strong jazz overtones, a real bonanza for Davis fans, but this allbum could have been much better... Frankly, I believe the arranger Quincy Jones is the one most responsible for this sort of concept, with Basie (and, presumably, his band) being quite happy to earn some money without much effort."
3,Not what I thought,"This product suprised me. But in a good way. I was pleased with the eye shadow. It lasts all day. The colors are okay, but kinda dark. Overall happy."
5,REBA'S CDS,"MY DREAM TO BE OWNING EVERY CD OF HERS.. I REALLY ENJOY LISTENING TO HER MUSIC , I FEEL THAT IT TOUCHES EVERY WOMAN IS SOME WAY,WHICH IS IMPORTANT CAUSE MEN ARNT AROUND TO HEAR HER SING, WHICH THEY DONT USUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE IS SINGING ABOUT SOMETIMES,, TELL HER MY BIGGEST DREAM OK PLEASE!"
2,Massive Shark Jumpage,"This was a terribly disappointing season from one of the cleverest, funniest shows of recent history. Sure, it's still better than 9/10ths of American network tv, but for someone who enjoyed the previous three seasons it's a real let down. I could go into details, but others are writing more cogently. I just wanted to help fans of the show adjust their expectations downward before they buy this disc."
3,"oh, well. out with a wimper.","Jeff leaving the show was a real blow. I was watching it at the time on tv, and was disappointed by the change to such an extent that I stopped watching the show. Apparently, I wasn't the only one.After some time, I came back and watched season four, because I loved the first 3 so much. It's ok, but much of it seems forced. Season 1 is still my favorite, and it goes downhill from there, with 2 being 41/2 stars, 3 being 4. (ok, not much of a downhill, but season one still makes me belly laugh after so many years of watching it over and over.)Instead of trying to replace Jeff, which is really what they did with this character, trying to be so wacky, they should have come up with something completely different, character-wise. A lesbian friend for Jane would really have hit the spot, for example! (yes, I know she just fakes it for attention, but that could have been part of the plot.)I actually own all four dvds, and watch them occasionally. They're still fun."
3,Coupling - The fourth and last season,Richard Coyle who played Jeff quit after the third seasonFor the fourth season they brought in a new character to reprise Jeff and he did not have the acting technique of Richard Coyle. It would have been better to have created a whole new type of character.I bought it to complete the series. The first three season are a must.
3,Just not the same,"While Patrick is by far my favorite character, the show just isn't the same without Jeff. They've tried to duplicate the character in Oliver, but it seems forced and awkward. We loved the first 3 seasons, but this season fails to reach the same rarefied air--we watch an episode now and again, but it's just not the same experience."
2,They missed it!,3 great seasons and it goes down the drain. Jeff's replacement sucks. Also the rest of the crew like Jane starts to change. Its not funny anymore.
2,Tremendously disappointing,It was bad enough that Jeff wasn't present but trying to fit the character Oliver into the picture made things even worse. All of the chemistry between the characters seemed to have vanished and the show just kind of limped along.
1,What happened to this show?,"I bought the first three seasons of Coupling after watching them on PBS,but I won't be buying season 4 as it is simply AWFUL!Without the Richard Coyle character Jeff, the series does indeed seem to limp along,a dim shadow of the funny show it once was!Maybe the writers of the first three seasons left with him.The Oliver character is simply too friggan stupid to believe,too stupid to live actually!I guess this was the last season and it's not hard to see why.R.I.P Coupling."
1,Got Ripped off....,My sister bought me COupling Season 4 off my Amazon wish list for Christmas. Yayyyy! Just opened to watch the season and found two copies of disc #2 in the box; basically an outtakes disc with no full episodes. Got zero copies of disc 1 which has the episodes. Feeling really ripped off right now. :-(
4,"Still a great show, but...","I have been a big fan of this show from the very first season. It is funny, a little edgy (at least in comparison to American shows) and very entertaining. So of course I was anxiously awaiting the start of the fourth season. Even thought fourth season remained funny, I could not believe that my favorite character - Jeff was no longer part of it. I was and still am puzzled by it, how do you replace the funniest character on the show?Instead we get a less sympathetic and not as funny knockoff called Oliver. And even though Moffat tried to put Oliver in Jeff-like situations with same type of dialog, it's just not the same. I wont Jeff back. In addition to Jeff's departure, it seems like the whole show got toned down a notch. I guess I got used to this show to be unbelievably funny and changes made to it do not seem to make it better. However, like I said before it is still very funny and I will be watching it many times till the next season comes out."
4,Magnificent Case Study,"Almost everyone here praises the British ""Coupling"" and knocks the NBC version. And rightly so. But for heaven's sake, please watch the NBC version. Watch it back to back with the British episodes on this and the previous disc. Watch them simultaneously with a split-screen or PIP feature. It's fascinating. If you've ever wondered what great actors bring to a script (and what mediocre actors can suck out of one), this is the ideal case study. The original ""Coupling"" (represented here) is so vastly superior to its American cousin, it's staggering.This is a rare opportunity to truly appreciate the actor's craft. And Jack Davenport, Richard Coyle, Sarah Alexander, Gina Bellman et al deserve wild praise for superior work. Compare, contrast and see if you don't agree."
3,not as good as past seasons.,"I am a big fan of this series and have watched all episodes. It is a funny, clever show and the entire cast has been interesting. However, this season the writing was definitely not as good as before. The laughs were few and far between and the actors seemed stiff and the entire show felt forced and awkward.A new character named Oliver is introduced to replace Jeff. He is obviously meant to be an identical replacement, but he doesn't work. He is mostly annoying, not funny, and his physical gags are not amusing. I think the show would have been better served by picking a replacement that was very different from Jeff.Finally, although this season is disappointing, it would have been nice to have more than 6 episodes. BBC production continues to baffle me as this show's output has varied radically from year-to-year. The show continues to have potentially interesting storylines, so I am hoping for better writing and execution next year."
3,Not as Good as First Season,"It seems to me the writing in the 2nd season is a formulaic, ""retro-fit"" imitation of the first season. The scripts have gone from *creative* to *re-creative*, and much of the subtlety that made the first season so clever is gone.For instance, a brilliant situation wherein Steve makes an emotional defense of men's desire to see ""naked bottoms"" to five bewildered dinner guests & Susan is now an annoying diatribe wherein Steve complains of Susan's incessant ""where are you going?"" 's. Fleeting glances into the odd mind of a buzzed but innocent Jeff have become episode-long excursions into the perspective of a drunk & exhausted Jeff (whose penchant for bar peanuts & beer burps makes his every scene seem as if he's on the verge of tossing his cookies). The natural, effortless beauty of playful Susan is now covered in too much Maybelline. [...]A lot better than the pathetic American rip-off, yes, but for me it's no match for the original, witty first season."
1,Where's the wide screen edition?,"The original show was broadcast widescreen and the DVDs are widescreen. Why is it streaming in pan and scan?I rate Coupling Series 4 ""3"" stars (series 1-3 rate ""5""), but it's unacceptable that it's not being shown in its original format."
5,"Season One, Part Two","The second season of ""Coupling"" is just as funny as the first and the writing is even sharper.Although a lot of people like to compare this show to America's ""Friends,"" I instead found the storylines and writing to be more on par with ""Seinfeld"" in the show's ability to draw very funny storylines together into great endings. (That was what made the other classic BBC show ""Fawlty Towers"" such a work of genius).The cast also does a wonderful job of bringing these characters to life.Laugh out loud funny."
2,Jeff leaving + Oliver = Yuck!,"I love love love the first three seasons of Coupling. Each season was well done, the actors were great, the storylines were fantastic, and then Richard Coyle, who played the apparently irreplaceable Jeff Murdock, left the show. The only shows in this final season that are funny or even tolerable are the ones that new cast member Richard Mylan isn't in. To be honest, it isn't even the fault of the character as written. Richard Coyle could have played the character of Oliver and made it hysterical. It is the absolute over-acting by Mylan in every scene. His scenes are just painful and are to be ff through. That said, the rest of this season is okay. It is nice to see the other characters grow. Overall, it is worth watching but lower your expectations A LOT and be prepared to hit the FF button quite a lot."
2,"Oliver cannot replace Jeff - and ruins everything, trying to","I was dismayed to discover early in the first episode of Season 4 that Jeff was aparently already en route to Lesbos (!) and wouldn't be seen for the remainder of the Series!Instead we get this inserted look & sound-alike, called Oliver, who Moffatt gives all the Jeff-like lines & situations to, but the poor Newbie just can't handle them, and anyone who has got as far as Season 4 with the wonderful (so-far) 'Coupling' will be just left cringing and WISHING Jeff could be there delivering the lines in HIS inimitable and wonderfully zany and accomplished way!The rest of the cast are Wonderful, as we have come to expect & love, but each time the Oliver character appears, one is left feeling like fingernails have been dragged down a blackboard, and the whole scene is ruined by it.Stick with Seasons 1 - 3 !"
4,Love this show.,"This is one of my favorite shows. Season 4 is great but isn't the best. I really missed Jeff. The introduction of Oliver was slow. At first I didn't really like him but by the last 2 episodes he really began to grow on me. Then it ended. I wish their seasons were longer. 6 episodes just wasn't enough. I would give it 4.5 stars if it had that option, but I'll stick with 4."
2,When Coupling lost its mojo,"If all the other reviews didn't make it clear enough, let me state once more: No Jeff, no mojo. Some of the best moments of the previous three series center around Jeff's crazy concepts: The ""giggle loop,"" ""sock gap,""nudity buffer,"" and ""melty man"" to name a few. It was bad enough that they lost this vital element, but they made it even worse by trying to force the new guy, Oliver, into becoming a copy-cat Jeff. A ploy which failed. Miserably. Let me suggest that you adopt C.S.F.A.T. or Coupling Season Four Avoidance Technique with this one."
5,Funniest show EVER,"I got hooked on this show watching BBC America in it's first season and it quickly became my favorite show of all time. Unfortunately, the American copy didn't work at all, but this DVD is a must have in any comedy enthusiast's collection. The comparison to a cross between 'Friends' and 'Sex and the City' doesn't do it justice. This series is fresh, witty and sometimes a little raunchy, but I've never laughed so hard! The writing and cast are superb and I can't wait for Series 3 on DVD!"
3,Jumped the Shark,"Only a couple of good episodes in the whole lot. Severly disappointed with the way Susan's pregnancy was handled. For a show that was a laugh riot, I spent the last season wondering why nothing was funny anymore, and why Susan, a dedicated feminist who claimed her sexual independence, totally handed over control of her health to Steve during labor in which, of course, she couldn't ""handle"" having the baby and Steve had to consent for her to have a cesarean. Yuck. Too bad the show had to portray Steve's ""coming of age"" as a man by sacrificing Susan's physical autonomy and female creative power of childbirth."
2,Sadly Outdated Study!,"This is a sadly outdated study of gender in archaeology. With so many resources available, such as Gosline's ""Archaeogender"", why are we still relying on old reprints like this?"
2,ok product - terrible customer service,"Great machine. I've used it for extra storage for a long time. It's put up with a great deal different kinds of ubuse such as heat, slight impact, dust and smoke. After about 3 years of loyal service, it seemed to die. I did have to call customer service for a week before they responded but they pointed me in the right direction and saved the day! The next one that I buy will be a QPS."
5,What I thought I knew,"What's most amazing about this book is what you think you knowabout women's sexual organs and functions verses what you will knowafter reading it. I started the book one Saturday morning and couldn't put it down until I was finished. Stunned by my ignorance to what I thought was fact, but so glowing in what I had learned, I could not wait to tell my wife. If you are at all interested in understanding and improving intimancy in your relationships ...read this book. It's fun, with easy to understand terminolgy and concepts!"
5,Nice book,My daughter-in-law loved the book. It helped her out a lot and I got brownie points for sending it. :)
3,"Beautiful, and deep...","Pimone Triplett's poetry is like a really beautiful, really smart girl you fall for...at first you are so in awe of her beauty and the wonderful things she says and does that nothing else matters. Then you realize that you don't understand most of the things she says, but she's still so beautiful and they are wonderful things she's saying. Then you realize you're not really connecting with her well, though maybe you're learning something by being around her.You know how it goes. Eventually, you have to break it off, because you're just not right for each other. You're not really relating, you're just pretending for the sake of beauty and profundity. It might work for someone more beautiful and smarter than you are, but you need someone more on your level.It was fun while it lasted, you learned some stuff, but definitely not your best love."
4,"Even with a small voice, still creates a great jazz singer..",Most of the songs on this CD are well done!Anything by Blossom is always fresh to listen to!Most of the songs are of excellent jazz-flavor.David
2,A child's voice,"Easy listening, but it is odd that someone with a gir;'s voice would sing love songs for women. Yet, you may like this for historical reasons or if you have acquired the taste for this type of voice."
3,A good debut,"This is the first of Blossom's albums for Verve; like later ones it features her on vocals & piano with a sympathetic small group (Ray Brown on bass, Jo Jones on drums, and--mysteriously uncredited--Herb Ellis on guitar); four tracks also add a vocal chorus. The album is winsome & bright, with several excellent moments (such as a fine ""Lover Man"" and a hilarious ""A Fine Spring Morning""); though there are a few things that are less enjoyable: several tunes are sung in French (""Comment Allez Vous"", ""It Might as Well Be Spring"" & ""Tout Doucement""), and her pronunciation is terrible: I could do without the backing chorus, too.This is a good, not great, album: the best place to start is instead _Once upon a Summertime_, with its classic readings of ""Manhattan"" & ""Tea for Two""."
4,spring is definitely in the air when Blossom Dearie starts to sing!,"No collection of 1950s female vocalists is complete without at least one of Blossom Dearie's discs. This is a good place to commence a collection; for it features a decent cross-section of the styles and musical tastes on which Ms Dearie established herself.As other reviewers have noted, the highlight of the whole disc is Blossom Dearie's French translation of ""It Might As Well Be Spring"", full of delicate piano and Dearie's sensual, longing vocals. Other delights to be had include ""More Than You Know"", ""Now at Last"", ""Wait Till You See Her"", and ""I Hear Music"". The disc concludes with three never-before-released bonus tracks (""They Say It's Spring"", ""Johnny One-Note"" and ""Blossom Dearie's Blues"").Pop this disc into the CD player, sit back and unwind with the one and only Blossom Dearie! [VERVE/POLYGRAM 837934-2]"
3,Pretty but too loose,"I love these earrings, they are gorgeous and just the right size for a drop earring. The problem is they do not come with any type of security backing so mine fell out the first day I wore them. Fortunately enough for me, I was sitting right by where they fell and didn't loose them out somewhere. I would only recommend these earrings if they sell them with security post backs."
4,very cute,"These were purchased for our 17 year old daughter for Christmas. She wanted a complete set of ruby and diamond jewelry so I searched different sites to put together a set. You never really know what you will come up with. These earrings were just great. They were really cute and would go well with any ruby mix. great price, really great looking product."
1,WATCH OUT,"When I recieved these earrings, all the diamonds had been ripped off. Gone. Completely. And to be quite honest, the ""ruby"" looks like pink plastic stones. Wanted to get them for my mom for christmas, but now I have to send them back and i'm not sure if i'll even get her new present on time before crhistmas."
5,Beautiful Heart,Very Very Beautiful -- These are my woman's favorite -- I would like to find a pair in solid yellow and white gold. I would pay the price!
4,Great gift.,"I bought these for my mother on xmas, she loved it. She danced in cirlces, I don't see what was so amazing about them, but OK."
4,Lovely Earrings,"These earrings were everything I expected ... they look really nice. It would have been nice if they came with backs, but I was able to get some for them."
5,Merry Christmas,I received these earrings for Christmas from my husband and they are beautiful. I love the detail and the way they hang. I especially like that they are lightweight. The unique design with the flower detail is wonderful. My husband definetly has good taste in selecting jewelry for me .
2,In case you care....,"For those Rachel Weisz fans out there, you may not realize that she has a fairly sizable part in this episode. It might be one of the few reasons to watch this."
4,Great deal for beginners,"I would recommend all beginners to purchase this. It is very cheap and the dvd provided is very informational-- not so much the internet support though. It comes with mostly everything you're going to need-- the guitar, the bag, 2 picks, dvd, ""book"" (more like 3 pages) wires and a stand for the guitar. So all you would have to buy apart from this would be some sort of tuner. I think it is a very good deal. :]]"
4,Good for the first time guitar,"We recieved this guitar and during the tuning a string broke, they do not give instructions as to how to replace the strings but they include two additional strings. It is a very pretty instrument and my son love it! For the price it is wonderful, and the additional items that come with it are a great little bonus: pics,stand,carrying bag,adjustable strap, and strings."
4,awful fun flick,this is a cheap and cheesy knock-off of romero's night of the living dead and it's simply z-grade goofy nonsense...but it's fun z-grade goofy nonsense! i had a helluva good time watching this and admire hinzman's chutzpah in the zombie role here. sure it's a cheap and cheesy zombie movie but what the hell! it works and when it doesn't it's funny! far worse zombie flicks have been made. i wanted the zombie from night of the living dead back in action and hamming it up and that's what I got. loved it.
1,one word retarted!,"this has to be the worst zombie movie ever made. It was more like comedy hour with the zombies. I had bought this used cause it seemed good on the cover. But once i saw it i couldn't stop laughing. It was soooo stupid! If your looking for a good laugh i would reccomend this movie but if you expect a really scary zombie movie then i would reccomend the ""of the dead"" movies by george romero. This and burial ground are the worst zombie movies ever made!"
3,Gore Galore...that's about it.,"Sure, this movie has poor, poor production values, the dubbing (even though it's in English) is atrocious, the dialogue a joke, the plot none-existent, but so what?I'm not saying this is a great movie, it's just okay. There's some nudity and plenty of gore, but other than that, if you're looking for more, forget it.I think Hinzman took himself a bit too seriously though, the commentary track is boring--he put me to sleep!Rent it if you can first; I only bought it because it was a good childhood memory to re-live.Favorite quote: ""These zombies are about to kill my a*$!"""
4,A Very Solid Introductory Textbook,"We have used this textbook in our 9th Grade Global Studies course with good results. Within each unit it provides an overview of geography, ancient heritage, independence movements, and modern developments for the regions of Africa, all parts of Asia, Latin America, Europe & the Former Soviet Union, and The Middle East. Each chapter is divided into sections - each with preview & review questions, vocabulary, etc. We do supplement this text with enrichment readings, but we have found it to provide a solid foundation for the year-long course."
5,No nonsense,A real no nonsense character brings some real life leasons to the screen. What a pleasant relief from the usual Hollywood drivel. This movie is right up there with 'The Long Summer of George Adams'.
5,Great movie,"This is a great movie. Lots of lines worth remembering and quoting. Jessica Tandy and Paul Newman, how can you miss."
5,Get on down to Hattie's ...,"Christmas is a-comin', and this'd be a great gift for, oh, just about anyone. I saw the movie before I read the book. Except for one major plot twist (in deference, I suppose to Mr. Newman's leading-man status), the book is wonderfully faithful to the spirit of Mr. Russo's exceptional novel. The cast is great (Mr. Willis can actually act, if he has a mind to), and a fitting tribute to that great lady, Jessica Tandy. The musical score, the cinematography, the superb acting all around: they add up to one wonderful movie. I 'm surprised it hasn't been ranked with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as a must-see holiday classic."
3,Nobody's Fool,Very good movie. Wonderful plot and good cast of characters. Paul Newman always makes the movie come alive.
4,PAUL NEWMAN AS ANOTHER FLAWED IRISHMEN,"Paul Newman is a GREAT actor,who it seems to me, has NEWVER REALLY gotten his due.In ""Nobody's Fool"",Newman plays a near sixty year old divorced jack-of-all-trades,who at this somewhat advanced age realizes its time to finally meet his responsiblities to his grown son and grandsons.Director Robert Benton is abble to get fine performances from his entire cast,including Bruce Will and Melanie Griffith.(I'm not kidding.]The reason for the title of this review is because Mr. Newman has played a series of Irishmen-Murphy-Fort Apache,The Bronx-Gallagher-Absense of Malice-Galvin-The Verdict and Sullivan here.As I understand it Mr Newmans' mother was Irish-Catholic,from an old movie about the Dorsay brothers ""there is only one thing worse than being Irish and thats' NOT."
4,Nobody's Fool,Nobody's Fool was based on one my favorites authors book. So many films today are made for shock value and expected high profits. Nobody's Fool is a look into everyday reality and does an excellent job of protraying the good and bad in everyone. The film was as enjoyable as the book. I would highly recommend this film as a good evening of entertainment and relaxation from the everyday hustle and bustle.
3,Paul Newman good as always,"I was very disappointed by this movie particularly after the great reviews it had. I found it dreary, filled with unpleasant and unhappy people, certainly not something I would want to have in my library for the holiday season. Paul Newman gave a great performance but then, when didn't he. Even the opening shots of the movie, which led me to expect that there would be some beauty in the town, disappointed. This moving was tedious and seemed to take forever to wind its way to the end."
4,Wonderful.,"Acting is great, as well as a beautiful story. This world miss's Jessica Tandy and what she brought to so many. A decent, sweet, kind hearted beauty that this world has so few of already. What a great talent, and to be teamed up with Paul is just a treat for all of us. Thanks so much to all of you, and you're missed so much Miss Tandy."
5,The best FEEL GOOD movie I have ever seen!,"This movie is truley everything a feel good movie should be. All the acting, directing and comedy in this film was done to perfection. This should've won best picture!Don't miss it!The only question I have is why it is rated R. It has just 2 breif topless scenes and very little bad language. The MPAA must've had beter things to do in the 70's because I've seen nastier, more bad laguage and nudity in the 70's movies that were rated PG then. This movie coul've used a PG-13 at best and I would even reccommend it for family viewing. Anything for young kids would go over their heads and this is a movie teenagers should see to a spice of real life without all the crybaby stuff that's in most drama movies. ""Nobody's Fool"" is a feel good movie that doesn't really bring any tears yet seems to tell the story of peoeple's lives. Hard working regular good people."
5,The Civil War: Commemorative Documentary Collection,Brought this as a gift for someone who is really into the Civil War. The Receiver seemed to like it.
5,The Bluegrass Banjo Gold Standard,"This is still the Bluegrass Banjo CD by which all great Bluegrass Banjo is judged. It probably always will be. This CD is one of the reasons I fell in love with the hard driving sound of bluegrass banjo. Scruggs invented the 3 finger style and his mastery has never been equaled. In my humble opinion, this is the best single snapshot of Scruggs Style banjo ever recorded. Although it's a short CD, if you love bluegrass banjo, you will never grow weary of listening to this one. All songs are performed without lyrics and all are performed 3 finger style. If you own only 1 banjo CD, this is the one to own."
5,Bluegrass at it's best,Not a very long CD but every song is pure gold. I bought the tape version because the CD was (and still is) selling for around $150-$200. I made myself a promise that if it was re released on CD I would buy it just to help keep these old albums from dying out or being too expensive. I love this CD and Bluegrass and this is the real deal.
5,Always Great,"What can I say? Flatt & Scruggs are always great! Nice album. Very uplifting, and soul food for the spirit within! I listen to it often!"
2,Foggy Mountain Banjo,"I thought I was purchasing a ""CD"" without scratches on it. However, the ""CD"" would not play without doing a considerable amount of work in an effort to remove some of the major scratches. It now works and I really enjoy playing it. Thank you bunches."
1,"$188.88 as of 06/06/2012, really, REALLY?? I'll never hear it.","Every where I go, this is touted at the BEST Flatt and Scruggs, BEST Bluegrass Banjo... all KINDS of awards. But, even before the re-release, this was a rare and expensive CD. FOR THE LOVE OF PETE!!!! Is it THAT difficult to make more or is the manufacturer hoarding them???? Could somebody tell me the SECOND best CD?"
2,What role does this book serve?,"Overall, this is a well-written book. It covers a variety of topics, from preference maximization through existence and stability of eq'ia, to optimal control and growth models.However, I'm not sure what its niche is -- what this book provides that others don't, or that it covers more thoroughly. If you want math, read Simon and Blume or a math book. If you want micro theory, read Mas-Collel or Silberberg. If you want neoclassical macro theory, read Sargent. For optimal control, read Kamien/Schwarz or Seierstad/Sydsaeter. This book covers selected topics from each. Though it covers them well, much is left out.Noticeably absent from the book is any uncertainty, randomness, or probability. There is also no game theory. These seek huge omissions for a book which seeks to show the usefulness of mathematical techniques in economic analysis.Notation is also a bit unusual. I was a bit confused by some of the author's own notation for partial orderings and Cartesian products."
5,The best book in advanced Economics.,"Economists can be divided into those who have read ""Mathematical Economics"" and those who are going to read it. I believe this book can furhter your knowledge as no other book can do. Usually it takes many months, or even years to be fully understood. I would advice undergraduate students to start with books like K. Lancaster 's ""Mathematical Economics"" or maybe Simon and Blume's book, to get the best out of Takayama's wisdom. The challenge of reading this book is something that no good economists can avoid."
2,I hate to do this - but I agree with 'rash67'...,"Being a musician, I thought - hey! must be my kind of session. Unfortunately, nearly all the tunes are taken at breakneck speed simply for the sake of showing 'chop' expertise. Sure, these guys are incredible, but my ears simply gave out halfway through. There are way better recordings of all of these masters out there - skip this one."
1,you're not seriously considering this music are you?,"Punk has reached yet a new low. Grab some random girl off the street, make sure she looks and sounds like a man, and let her sing or whatever it is she does. This is tied with Anti-Flag for the worst punk band out there. The music may be fast at times (wow it's punk!), but it's bland and really quite horrible. The second you hear the singer's voice, you'll know where it's going. She sounds like the guy from Rancid, only more like a man. I've seen comparisons to Hole on here. They're pretty accurate. They ... bad enough to be compared to Hole. I can't understand how people see talent in these kind of bands. They are completely talentless. Fourtunately, they aren't known enough to screw up any music scene."
2,Vinyl Version - Bad Sound Quality - Sounds like a CD,I like the songs. This review is about the vinyl album. It sounds like it was cut from a normal 44khz CD. It sounds dull and lifeless like CD's do. Might as well buy the CD instead of vinyl.
3,Straight up punk rock... if thats your thing,"I had really loved every song on Coral Fang, so when I bought this one I expected catchy guitar riffs with hard, but melodic vocals by Brody. This one is more traditional punk rock. Hard, fast, unrefined and kinda noisy. It's that old school punk rock, that's good for a while... until you get a head ache."
4,this should've been the breakthrough album.,"The Distillers broke into the mainstream with their sophomore album, Sing Sing Death House, but anyone who's heard their debut album knows that SSDH pales in comparison.Many of the songs on the debut are anthemic - ""World Comes Tumblin"", ""Red Carpet and Rebellion"", and ""The Blackest Years"" come to mind. It also has its share of cuts for the streetpunk crowd - ""Idoless"", ""Blackheart"", ""Girlfixer"". Brody's even written us a love song: ""Gypsy Rose Lee"".As for the lineup: Brody is the only remaining original member of the Distillers, and though the original lineup may not be the most musically sound, they're the most raw and the most passionate. If you're torn between this and the new Distillers album that comes out next week, pick this one up."
5,Fem Punk and hardcore at its best...,"Ok to the dude that said this band is talentless is an idiot... its obvious isnt it? If you think ThUrsday and The Used are punk then you must have grown up in the last decade... go listen to sugarcult. Anyways, this band rocks out, they have great bass, thrashing guitars and rad drums. Not to mention that the singer has one hell of a voice."
2,Poor fit.,"Probably my own fault... I wanted something easily slipped on, and I maybe should have ordered up a size... but these were definitely too small and narrow."
2,dog boots guardian gear,"I don't like how they fit on the dog, they are not form fitting, they are loose and make it hard for him to walk."
3,A volatile read,"This book had a decent plot line--spy mission, Italian backdrop, and misunderstanding of hero and heroine. But half-way through the book I became so tired of Lady Pamela and Lord Douglas' hot and cold treatment toward each other: they were one minute so cold and unconcerned and next minute furious and temper-flared...I felt I was having a Turkish bath... Too easy to catch a cold. And they were violent, too--They were always fighting against one another and threatened to beat or strike to force others to submission-- too much power struggle and not enough caring and romance there.Also the explanation of Lord Douglas' mood swings was not satisfactorily written, I did not think it was convincing enough for me, however, I could feel Lady Pamela's frustration though. The last complaint was the tone of writing was too contemporary, therefore, did not quite have the Regency mood for me."
1,we would give it 0 stars---if it would let us,We received this as a gift. We took it out of the box and put it together when we were doing our nursery. We tested it a couple of times and it worked fine. Now our baby girl is due anyday and it doesn't work. The gears inside are all jammed up so we can't even use it manually. We can't take it back because we don't have the box anymore and we received it as a gift so we don't have a receipt. We are just glad that we received it as a gift---and not wasted our own money on it.We are very upset that we didn't even get to use it.
2,Great Idea - Poor Design,"I thought this diaper pail was going to be the answer to our diaper disposal issues. We had previously tried a popular diaper pail that did nothing to stop odors. This one does the trick with keeping the room smelling not like a diaper, but lacks in the design area.First of all, it should have been designed to be at least twice as big. We use size 4 diapers, and this pail barely holds two days worth of diapers. If I wanted to change the pail that often, I would use a regular garbage pail.Secondly, when it's full or the batteries die, the pail is useless. Therefore, you're left standing there holding a steaming diaper!And finally, the materials used seem flimsy for the amount of use the pail receives.I'm hoping for an improved version soon!"
2,Not clearly described!,"We purchased this diaper pail because all descriptions, and even the video on the Graco website made it seem like when you drop the diaper in the pail, it falls directly into the bag and has the filtration system to contain the smell. This is NOT the case. This pail has a similar system as the Diaper Champ, in that there is a ""ball"" that catches the diaper, then it spins and drops it into the chamber below with the bag when the lid closes.We were hoping to use this for cloth diapering, so we were looking for a pail that has a filtration system, but none of the special bags, crimping or chambers that catch the diaper and drop it into the pail. With this method, we'd have to constantly clean the ""ball"" that catches the cloth diaper, and we just don't want to deal with that. I guess we're stuck using a standard garbage can or pail for our cloth diapering. I wish someone would invent a great filtered pail for cloth diapering!"
1,awful,"this thing worked once. ONCE! After that, the motion senor never worked properly again. So then we just figured we'd raise and lower the lid manually. Well, because of the gearing for the auto lift, most of the time the lid jams and won't go back down after you open it.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. Unless you enjoy things that don't work.... it's junk."
1,"Just because it's Graco, doesn't mean it's good.","We returned one of these right away, because the hands- free option did not work. After exchanging it for a new one, we discovered that it, too, did not work. However, as a parent of a newborn, you just don't have time to run to Babies R Us all the time for a new diaper pail, so we decided to just use the manual lift option and be done with it.Fast forward 8 months: the manual lift option no longer works either! The lid sticks all the time, and you have to open the stinky pail and fiddle with the inside bowl to get it to open. Back to Babies R Us, and this time we got a Diaper Champ. So far, so good, and the Diaper Champ can use any type of bag as well.I will say that this pail does hold the stink in. However, if you have to go into the stink zone to fix the lid all the time, what does it matter?"
1,This pail is a piece of junk!,"And ""junk"" is too nice a word for it. The hands free thing never worked, and the part that flips over for you to put the diaper in when you open the lid doesn't come up all the way, so I have to cram the diapers in just to use it. We've only had it a couple of months too! A pail that costs this much should work more than two months! On top of that, those little filters are a joke. This pail stinks worse than any we have owned to date. Fortunately, my son has quit wearing diapers, so we just have our daughter's to deal with, but still...this pail is NOT worth the money and we are really upset that we wasted our money on this product."
2,Waste of money,"We had the diaper champ with our first and I wish I had bought another. The ""touch free"" worked with about as much frequency as those hand dryers in the public restrooms. And the gears inside jammed up everytime the pail got full. (about 1-2 times a week with 2 kids) Don't waste your money with this it's a piece of crap."
4,18 parodies tell the life of Christ,"This cd tells the story of Chist to 18 parody's of classic rock songs,the production on this cd is weaker than their newer stuff ,and while they tell the story of Christ it is very brief,because their is only so mutch time on a cd,but they do it pretty good, these are some of the best songs, Hotel cant afford ya (parody of ""hotel californa"" by The Eagles) Parable guy (parorody of ""american pie"" by Don mclean) I have to die first (parody of ""eye of the tiger"" by Surviour) Died and rose (parody of ""china grove"" by the Doobie brothers) Walk his way (parody of ""walk this way"" by Aerosmith) John 1:1 (parody of ""fun,fun,fun"" by the Beach boys) Narrow way to heaven (parody of ""stairway to heaven"" by Led zeppelin) and Fakey shakey parts (parody of ""achy breaky heart"" by Bill ray cyrus) this cd is not as good as their newer stuff,but stil is great"
1,frighteningly awful,"This band is even worse than Hawthorne Heights I fear, and that's really saying something. I am appalled that people are giving them 5 stars when sweet bands like The Panic Channel and Green Day don't even get that many on average. For goodness sake, could your musical tastes be any lamer? This band doesn't make music, they mooch off already existent songs which are great until they ruin them with their agonizingly corny lyrics; anyone could make better lyrics! How dare people rate the original artists less than this violently pathetic band! They deserve no popularity, and it's no wonder to me why I even saw all of their CDs at a discount store AUTOGRAPHED even, unopened, for ONE DOLLAR EACH. They're that bad. Please never buy any of the CDs by this band, they're awful beyond belief. It's so awful that it's hard to even listen to, and at that point I'd be hesitant to call it music. One star is the only reasonable rating for this item. Down with Apologetix!"
2,to slow,"i ve had problems with this laptop since after the first month I bought it, had to reinstall the operating system twice already now i keep having problems with all media players, honestly i wish i would have spent more money and buy another laptop in a place like circuit city where at least u can take it back now i feel like I am stack with piece of junk...."
4,James Clavell's Shogun (1980),"Shogun shows a time in Japan when it was becoming a nation, and not just separate Warlords. The movie shows the good with love interests, the cleanliness of the society. It shows the bad with actions that can have people killed from beheadings, boiling in oil and crucifixion. The movie teaches some Japanese and a culture that is still partially relevant today in understanding today's Japanese society.It was also a time of the Catholic Church beginning to have an influence; a time of gaining power and gaining great wealth for the Church through a monopoly on trade with the rest of the world. The church at that time had both very godly men, and those that were in it for the money and power. Just like any time in history, including today, there are people that will gain notoriety and power through unscrupulous actions.Shogun is well written and both entertaining and educational. I highly recommend it for anyone that is interested in Japanese culture."
4,Shogun -Sho good,"I had never seen this mini-series before buying it for my dad for his birthday...definitely not state of the art because it was a late seventies early eighties made for tv mini-series, and the acting from Chamberlain can be a little on the cheesy side, but very good over all. A must watch...it may take you a month to get through it all though!"
4,"Shogan is a great movie series,",I saw the series on TV and never liked all the commercial interuptions. When I got the DVD's I was excited and was not disappointed with the movie quality. The only negative is I wish the set was in individual cases. A great historical view of the Japenese culture during the Samurai era.
5,Good way to see the impact of two cutures,"The way its presented, the knowledge of two different cultures, social, religious and family make the movie interested. Besides the actuation is wonderful, every body act the way they should.It is a great document for those who like to know more about our past, the way people behave."
5,Old Japan,"I saw this movie , then read the book, and then I saw the Mini-Series on TV. They are all wonderful. I have been stationed in Japan and gotten to see some of the places in the movie. The Villiges, the people, the temples, Wow."
4,best gift I could give my husband,My husband was delighted with the Shogun DVD. It was one of his favorites from long ago. The quality is great. He is very happy with it.
5,Wonderful love story.,"I watched this as a five year old boy on t.v. and it really frightened me at the time, although I couldn't help but keep watching the series. I remember being scared but completely absorbed in the story on a very visceral level. As an adult I read ""King Rat,"" and then started on ""Shogun"" and so I really wanted to watch the series again. Fortunately, it is on DVD. I was just as entranced by the series as an adult as I was as a child, only my focus was different. The love story presented in the series is really very beautiful and I think the story line really capitalizes on the male perspective of what romance is. Although I enjoyed the sections of the plot that centered around the intrigues and warfare that accompanied Toranaga's rise to power, it was the love story that interested me the most and really touched me. I highly recommend the set."
3,Great Story but very dated,"I enjoyed this much more when it first aired as a ""mini-series"". Chamberlain is good and teh Shogun very well played."
5,Epic Mini-Series,"Shogun by James Clavell is one of my favorite novels and the mini-series is fabulous, if a bit tedious at times. This 10-hour epic follows the exploits of John Blackthorne, a navigator on a Dutch ship in the 1600's who finds his way to the Japans through the Magellan Straight. In Japan Blackthorne is confronted by a culture strange to him and Portuguese traders and priests who have monopolized trade with the Japan's because of their heretofore secret passage through the Straits. Blackthorne finds himself thrust into the middle of a political struggle that works against him staying alive, much less getting back home. There's plenty of politics, intrigue, and romance here and you'll find that owning the DVD you're like to watch the entire 10-hour show without much break in-between."
1,INCOMPLETE,I DECIDED NOT TO PURCHASE THE DVD SET. WHY? BECAUSE THEY EDITED OUT ABOUT 3 HOURS FROM THE ORIGIONAL RELEASE. RIDICULOUS.
4,Incomplete,"While advertised as a complete version, it is far from that. Several scenes that are imperative to Bkackthorne's desire to learn Japanese and the local customs are left out, cut for whatever reason. Really wish it was complete, though i guess we're stuck with either this, or finding a laserdisc player and disc from the mid 80's."
4,Good Companion to the Book,"I first read Shogun this past summer (2004), and liked it so much that I just had to buy this DVD set. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I felt it was unable to completely capture Toranaga's cleverness and wit. I got my brother hooked on the book, and he has been watching the DVD incrementally after he reads a section of the book. It's quite fun being able to pick out the little differences between the book and this series. As countless others here have said, this DVD set is awesome, but as usual, not as good as the book."
2,No attention to detail.,"The actual movie is great, however the reproduction to DVD was done very poorly. The ""set-up"" menu has a subtitle selection for English. Sounds great, but it only subtitles the English dialogue, not the Japanese dialogue. Brilliant!!! While many think this is to put you in Blackthorne shoes, it isn't. It's a major flaw in the reproduction that ruins the movie. Unless, of course, you speak Japanese."
3,Disappointing,"I first saw Shogun when it aired on TV, back when I was a kid. I loved it at the time. I recently saw it again, and was very disappointed. First, the lack of subtitles is annoying in the extreme. For a story involving court politics, Jesuit schemes, pirate treasure, and forbidden love, one really needs to be able to follow what is said. For the first four hours or so, forget about it (unless you speak Japanese). If you don't, you'll know some basic phrases by the end.So on my mini-series scale, with North and South a 5, and something truly terrible a 1 (I suppose if WWF made a mini-series, this would be it), Shogun is a 3. Not terrible, but not good either."
1,shogun,video tape #3&4 was very defective not view able return to amazon rec'd another video & it also was defective return it requested a refund
2,Something must be wrong with me...,"but I did not like this movie. It's so slow, and there's a lot of Japanese with no subtitles. And a lot of very slow walking. I just couldn't get into it."
2,Shogun,"I don't know what's wrong with me, because most people seem to like this miniseries. I love miniseries, but I found this one really boring. Maybe it's because I'm a girl, and there are hardly any women in this series. Also, the first 4 hours were interminable because everyone was speaking Japanese, and there are no subtitles! I guess that's supposed to show you how scary and unsettling it is to be in a foreign land, but it seemed overdone to me. In general, the plot moved way too slowly to keep my attention."
4,The Movie ranks alonside the book.,"I'm an avid reader, and when SHOGUN came out on TV, I decided to watch the movie and read the book later. It's a terrific movie, and I enjoyed all the characters along with the people who played them. Afterwards i settled in to read the book. It was a pleasant surprise, because the movie worked well when compared to the book. I now have both the book and the movie. The actors who played in the movie fit into the characters as created by Lavelle. I have read the book a few times, and I'm in the process of enjoying the movie again. They are not identical, but definitely tell you the same story in an enjoyable way."
5,Classic!,A classic and well worth it! The movie is great and the box set is very nice as well. The dvd conversion was done quite well given the age of the media.
5,Great Series/Movie,This is a movie we've enjoyed in the past and wanted to add to our library. I recommend it to anyone who likes James Clavell.
5,"Memories, Memories","When it was on TV I didn't get to see all the segments because of work. Now the blanks are filled in. In my view, the best Chamberlain ever did.Amazon has an excellent selection."
2,Great Show - Lousy DVD Production,"I simply cannot believe how absurd the production for this magnificent mini-series is. The 2-star rating is not for the mini-series, because that was one of the greatest shows ever produced for television.The 2-star rating is because there are no subtitles available for the Japanese speaking parts. If you set English subtitles to ON, the only time they work is with the English speaking parts!!! So, there is no way of knowing what is being said when the Japanese characters are speaking, except when they are being interpreted by the Jesuit priest. This is so utterly stupid!!! English subtitles that only work with the English speaking characters!!! How absurd can they get?"
3,Shogun,"The movie is great, couldn't be happier. Was a bit worried when after removing the plastic wrapper around the DVD set, pieces of plastic fell out. The DVD holders within the set were shattered. I watched the movie and the DVDs worked well so no problem, transfered them into CD holders to protect them. Still, was disappointed but felt not worth the effort to return."
2,"Shogun was what I expected, but.....","The CD was used sold as new. Several times during my initial playing (5 discs total) I got a popup window saying, ""this disc has been previously played. This portion is damaged and will not play."" Then the video picks up somewhere down the line. The 5th disc was advertised as containing titillating extras all of which remain a mystery to me as they would not play at all.So it looks like I was sold a poorly refurbished item as new and it was also seriously flawed.Amazon might want to be THE WORLD'S BIGGEST RETAILER, but what they are in effect doing is driving prices up and quality down. They are a new layer of protection for the cybercriminals. Sounds certainly like some laws are being broken!"
1,The video is not faithful to the original TV mini-series,"Having passionately watched the mini-series ""SHOGUN"" many times over, I was dissappointed, that after spending the money to buy a ""complete"" copy for myself, that it wasn't complete. If not cut, this expensive edition is clipped of many of of it's charming vignettes. I would gladly forgo the fancy packaging for the original version..."
4,Great Gift,"I bought Shogun as a gift for my father, and he was so excited. He loved the mini series and thought the extras were great."
5,Shogun,Excellent TV series and still as good and exciting as when it was new. Somewhat accurate with the names changed.
5,Shogun - The complete Epic,"This is a fantastic series. Why on earth doesn't any of James Clavell's works end up on DVD?? If they were on DVD, I'd buy them again!"
5,"Again, Again, and Again","I taped the movie myself, then bought it on VHS, and now have gotten in on DVD. It's such a great movie, the best mini-series ever, that I never get tired of watching it. And, not only is it great entertainment, my five-year-old grandson, who is 25% Japanese, is learning the Japanese language from it and becoming interested in Japanese history."
5,A neat combination of History and Drama,"I have read Mr. Clavell's book, plus read about the history of feudal Japan, including the battle of Sekigahara and the arrival in Japan of the English Pilot Smith. By the use of these historical events in order to make his novel, Clavell's book gives a great insight into Japan of the year 1600. The movie is a great adaptation of the book and does not dissapoint the viewer. The only real change from history in both novel and movie is the changing of names of the principal characters. Despite this, it is captivating to watch."
1,Shogun Review,"About 3/4 of the way into the first disk the movie just froze. That is, the image displayed was static. There was of course no sound. I could not fast forward.By returning to the main menu and selecting a scene subsequent to the scene that froze I was able to see the remainder of disk #1."
5,Excellent Mint Condition,This DVD set arrived in a brown cover without any padding. But it was in good condition and shrink wrapped. The DVDs were in excellent codition. Not a single scratch. Great condition.
5,Enjoyable,I had not seen this since the original TV series. It was fun to watch again....the acting was better than I had remembered too.
3,for students?,"This is the required text in my Eucliden Geometry class in college and while for the most part I find this book a useful tool, I often find terms and definitions either underexplained or introduced without definition, which can be frustrating to a student new to the dicipline. It has a very easy-to-follow introduction to non-Euclidean geometies, however, and I recommed the book especially on this level. Overall, however, I feel it could be written in more of a student-friendly manner."
1,General maintance,Had this tester for 2 years. Used the tester maybe a total of 10 times. After only minimal use the Load Switch failed. When I contacted Milton they we little or No help. Its a useful piece of equipment but rendered usless with a defective Load switch and Milton wanted nothing to do with correcting the problem.
2,Trouble maintaining connection using Windows XP,"Installed nicely, was up and running in 5 minutes. Would maintain connection for 2 or 3 minutes and then lock my P3 700 laptop with 384 MB Ram up tight and cause the Blue Screen of Death at start up. I bought this card on a friends recommendation, however he also has a Siemens wireless router. I was using it on a 2WIRE Wireless DSL Modem/Router. Worked with their customer support people on-line and on the phone for 4 days before giving up. Mought a Microsoft MN520 Adapter and have had not one issue. However Microsoft Card does not appear to be constructed as well as the Siemens, but it works."
2,siemens = speedstream = not very compatible with xp and Linu,"Started using this card in windows 2000. the config utility that comes with has no option to ""discover"" the networks and find the available SSID's.Been using it now for a while with XP. The driver is not very good with XP. Might find the network, but very slow compared to a D-link card I'm using in the same laptop.Also, right now, the card can not get a DHCP address anymore. Even though the D-link card still works fine. This even though I have a siemens = speedstream 2623 router. So sticking with the same brand did not help here.My advice: stay away from this brand all together. Buy a more known brand (linksys, netgear or so). Not this one. Not the greatest support. No updated drivers. the router does not support UPnP.Not that satisfied with this product. Would not buy it again!!"
1,Works but very buggy. Not worth it!,"Here is my story:As soon as I started the installation, Windows 2000 warned me the driver were not certified. However I just ingored the warning and the installation completed sucessfully.It works with my SMS 2404 WBR wireless router. However the signal strength is always about 50-60%, and the link quality never surpasses 60-70%, even though my laptop is just 3 ft from the router. For reference, my other Trendnet TEW-221PC card works just fine, with quality and signal strength approach 90-100% most of the time.Most anoying of all is its problem with DHCP. 3 out of 4 times I don't get IP address (DHCP). Remove and put it back a few times help. Another trick is change any parameter and ""apply"" (so that the card gets restarted) also helps sometimes. My other card does get this problem but rarely.Will try to return it next week."
1,Doesn't work on IBM T22,"I've had a terrible time with this card. I bought it as a present for my son, only to have him discover that it didn't work on his IBM T22 notebook. The store (Circuit City) wouldn't take it back because it was more that 14 days after I had bought it, so we returned it to Siemens (actually, Efficient Networks) for repair. They sent a new one, which also didn't work. We verified that the card works in a different notebook (a Gateway 450) and that other wireless cards work in the T22 (a D-Link and a Netgear). The symptom with the SS1021/T22 combo is that the SSID is garbled and the card won't connect to the access point. I called Efficient today to try to return the card but all they'll do is repair and return it. I just want my money back!My advice -- don't buy this card unless you can try it out in your notebook immediately!"
1,Constantly drops connections,"I bought this card because it was the only one the local Office Depot had in stock. I went home to read negative reviews of it, but hoped that I would be an exception. I was not. It constantly drops the connection, I have the same problem that someone else mentioend where I'll be within a few feet of the router and the signal quality will show up as poor (and continue to drop). I plan to return this today. If you're thinking about it, don't buy it."
1,Not compatible with Windows XP,They have buggy drivers.XP gives a warning when installing the drivers about the fact that the drivers have not passed Windows Logo testing. It will save a system restore point and allow you to proceed.I installed the software. The connection was continually dropping and reconnecting even though I was 10 ft. from the router.I went to Siemens site to get updated drivers and this did not help.Save yourself the headache do not buy this card if you have XP.Read the newsgroups it is a known issue.
1,An utterly useless book,"I bought this book for help with the reaer. But, it was no help at all. Most of my time with the teachers' book was spent correcting it.I do not know who wrote the translations, but they surely know little Latin. This is a worthless book and a waste of both time and money.Beyond that, most of the things in the book can be easily found in a decent University liberary. And, there you will get a good translation, by somebody that knows Latin."
1,Not Good..,i bought it thinking it seemed like a good idea but on the first day both tips broke. i couldn't believe it. cheap metal i guess. but the good thing is it has a lifetime warranty...but if it breaks every time...
2,Worked OK for a while.,"Works much better than old nail sets, which end up smashing your fingers and eventually deforming the tip. The spring action is nice and easy to do, especially in tight spots, where no worries about the hammer also denting the surrounding wall or trim.Review update from May 2012:These worked great for about a month of medium, DIY use installing trim and flooring, before the cupped tips shattered. Still usable, but no longer stay centered on brads or finishing nails, so I am deducting points for the loss of function. Great idea, just need a more resilient material, or keep the blunt on the ends."
1,not hardened properly?,one end chipped in several pieces after couple of uses driving 18 gauge brads!perhaps it is defective? very disappointed...
3,Spring Tool nail set,i install windows and doors and use this tool on the trim. 18ga nails and the big end chipped the very first day. Still does the job of sinking the nail.i would still buy another makes my job faster and easier.
3,Good product,"Sign is a pretty thin plastic, no complaints. It looks good on the wall. I think we were expecting a slightly higher grade of plastic."
1,Problems!!!!!!!!!! do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We bought this for my son for Christmas. We received it and the back wheel would not spin. It looked nice, but would not function. Amazon gave us a full refund. (I love AMAZON) I would buy a bike from a local store if possible, I think many problems are caused by shipping. Bikes are hard to pack in a truck. I have ordered 3 bikes in the last year, all with problems. Save time, go to the local wally world and get one."
2,color off,"I was very disappointed in the color of the bike when I received it. Though the picture shows a lemon yellow, the bike is actually more of a mustard yellow. I'm afraid my daughter will be very disappointed on Christmas Day."
5,Fascinating,"This is a truly wonderful book. This well-researched look at the past is structured around the lives of ordinary men and women. It's possible to imagine oneself living in the times described. Ever since reading in Smithsonian Magazine about Ekirch's research, I've anxiously awaited the publication of this book. At last, it's here."
5,Loved this book,For the last several weeks I have been aptly reading this book before I go to sleep. It is extremely entertaining if you find historical details and random historical facts about the goings on of people to be interesting you'll love this book. One of the best books I've read in months.
3,Depends on your level of interest.,"If you're hoping for a gripping tale of dark deeds and gaslight frolics, you might be disappointed. This is a serious-minded, scholarly work that lay-readers might see as hopelessly encumbered with statistics and repetitive exhibitions of factual evidence. There are overarching concepts, but there's no spellbinding narrative--this is not a story, it's a study. A such, it reads, at times, like an encyclopedia.I'm a professor and scholar myself (author of a few equally tedious tomes), so this shouldn't be taken as a criticism of Ekirch's book per se. If I were on a tenure board reviewing this work, I'd say it's an extremely cogent, well-researched book that does exactly what it should do. But if I take off my prof hat and play the part of the bookstore browser, looking for a titillating read, I'd say find something else. (Unless you're perversely interested in how far apart 17th-century Parisians strung their street-lanterns.)"
3,"Exhaustive research is appreciated, however....","I have read too many poorly-researched books to complain much about exhaustive research. However, plenty of passages leave the reader to exasperate ""ENOUGH CITATIONS ALREADY! WE GET THE POINT!""While the book is large and dense with information, the author's admittance, via his appropriate writing style, that the subject matter is not exactly dire, makes for pleasantly lighthearted reading."
3,Interesting yet repetitive...,"The farther in the book I got, the more I felt a sense of deja-vu. Have I read this before? Yes. In the first chapter. The books reads like a broken record: what at first is interesting quickly becomes tiresome."
3,Night Citations,"Yes, yes this book is terribly well-researched (supposedly twenty years worth of said research). It is so well researched that the last 70 pages of the book comprise a bibliography of the sources Ekirch quotes throughout the book. Herein lies my problem with this work. Its principal matter lies in quotation followed by cumbrously segued quotation. In other words, until the last few pages, there's no authorial voice to speak of, and it makes for disparate, humdrum reading. The best thing about it, by far, is the wealth of illustrations, mostly by Flemish artists, which shed more light, if you'll excuse the expression, on things than do a hundred quotations.Summing up: A carefully researched, scholarly work that takes no risks.If the reader is truly interested in this sort of thing, Robert Burton's age-old The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), a study of such things as went on in the night and other matters pertaining thereto, is the far more engrossing and erudite read."
3,Good read,The book is a great read but the author uses tons of references. It's okay for getting a broad idea but not a great source for research. You would spend a lot of time tracking down the author's own sources.
4,kindle fire issue,I really like this book which I bought for my Kindle Fire. I like to read my books with the black background. This feature does not work on the Kindle. So just make sure that you read the book with a white or sepia background. You can also see the pictures better if you double click on the small picture and the picture enlarges for better viewing. The Kindle chat representatives were very helpful when I asked about the problem. I really like the book and highly recommend it.
3,Interesting Look at Nights of the Past,"A friend recommended this book. The author obviously researched this subject thoroughly for years, and its indepth content reflects that. I enjoyed it."
5,"queensryche ""rocks""",I love this band and so do the theives that keep swipping it from me. It's nice to find copies affordable and fast.
4,"A Good, Solid Album","Great production and some great song writing. Highlights for me are the title track, Della Brown, The Thin Line, Best I Can and Resistance. I was never a big fan of Another Rainy Night or Anybody Listening. Had they taken those two songs off and included Last Time In Paris and Real World, it would be a five star album."
3,The last one,"This is the last worthwhile album by Queensryche, after they completely sol themselves out. ALthough much less heavy than ""Öperation Mindcrime"", it is good to listen and very well played."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!!!!,"After hearing QR's music for the first time when my daughter had ""Silent Lucidity"" playing, I fell in love with the sound and bought all of the CD's and video's available. I find that QR's music reminds us (from MindCrime on anyway) of what is important and what is not. Great Music."
2,wrong re-egalisation.,"Empire was probably re mixed by the musicians with ther damaged earing, so the midband and hi frequency are on the brighter side of reality and became verry agressive at high volume. Silent lucidity is a good example with is harsh trebble.The cd format sound much more analog than the 24/96 dvd audio but the midband frequency is more darker (and much more listenable).The old cd format is more pleasing to lisen to and much well recorded than the new dvd audio mix.The problem was (i think) the re-egalisation of all the songs, not the dvd audio format.sebastrophile"
4,A very good metal album,After their masterpiece Operation Mindcrime they came with this album. It is a very good album with great songs. My favorite songs are Empire and Anybody Listening (What an amazing song). The production is very good and the sound of the guitars are <<the something else>>. must for Queensryche fans and an album that most people in the metal scene will like.
3,Sell Out,"This was Queensryche's big sell out album 1990, boasting some MTV hits in the days when that network played music videos. The sound is much more accessable and even became mainstream. I know that locally there is a large metal following, but these people are often snobs. Silent Lucidity is a classic."
3,THIS CD I JUST TOLERATE,"OK i think there is something wrong with me, I got this CD after reading such great reviews about it only to find a few songs on it I liked, Its kind of Meat Head . The title song is great and a couple of the slower ones have substance but mostly I found the other songs on this CD I just tolerate, Queensryche have proven they can do much better than this, check out OPERATION MINDCRIME or PROMISED LAND for something great...HEAR IN THE NOW FRONTIER, thats a very good CD."
3,"EMPIRE is so Awesome!!!...this ""gold"" cd is too Quiet!!!","CRANK THIS BABY UP!!! Unbelievable digital sound quality...""EMPIRE"" is the ultimate ""play at maximum volume"" CD...(the ending of ""One And Only""---YAOW!!!!!)...Gold makes this QR CD too quiet! Same volume as the first Empire CD...best digital disc I've ever heard in my life, just needs to be louder!!! Go with the digital remaster---more music, more volume! I spent too much American greens on this piece...20 STARS FOR THE EMPIRE, 3 stars for the golden waste of my time! What a silent lucidity! Close your eyes........"
4,Queensryche enters the 90's,"This is one of those cds you can play all the way through with out skipping tracks, aka, Perfect Highway Album. I would consider every track to be more than decent. The only problem I have with this album is that there are only a few stand out tracks such as ""Silent Ludcidity, ""Della Brown"" and ""Empire"" The rest are good but i rarely will go to a different track just to hear a different song. This is just one of those albums you just have to listen to from start to finish"
5,QUEENSRYCHE........ANYBODY LISTENING?,"Queensryche USED to be the best band in the world, and I sadly have to say that this is their last record that is entirly awesome with no flaw. Dont get me wrong Promised Land is alright. But Empire is a record you just cant get enough of and the highlights are Best I Can, Jet City Women, and Empire, but of course there are many more on this album. This is a must have for you Queensryche fans [who have a really good taste in music]. This is just a MUST HAVE!!!!"
4,Great stuff from a great band,"The first time I heard this cd, I seriously wanted to puke all over it, and chuck it out the window. And im not exaggerating.But after listening to it a few times, I can safely say that this is a solid disc, packed with great songs.The opening few songs are a bit rough (IMO) but it gets really good around song 3.The bonus songs are nice, I really liek Last Time In Paris.Anyway, Id give it a 5/5 if it wasnt for the opening songs.Still, go out and check this out, though it might take a few listens to really get into."
4,The epitome of progressive rock,A solid album from start to finish. The guitar and drumming musicianship is simply amazing. It's too bad that Queensryche has not been able to duplicate an album of this quality. (Operation: Mindcrime is the only one that comes even CLOSE)
1,Silent Lucidity: Cure for Insomnia!,"Dreadful album! I'm sorry to any Queensryche fans that I may offend, but I listen to bands like Metallica, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains so to me, Queensryche's ""rockin'"" songs sound like fraggle rock to me. And I also listen to bands like Pink Floyd and Guns N' Roses so this music doesn't seem very emotional to me either despite what some of you have said. This album came out the same year as Metallica and Guns N' Roses released great albums, and I think only 1 year before Nirvana released ""Nevermind"" so this album just doesn't cut it. Some of you say that Queensrych sound like Pink Floyd. Sorry, but they don't. If you want a band that sounds like Pink Floyd, buy Pink Floyd. I'm sorry to any of you mutants who might actually like this garbage, but that's just my opinion."
4,one of his best,"My favorite John Gierach book happens to be whichever one I am reading at the time, and this one is a welcome addition to the list...Anyone who reads his books knows he prefers bamboo rods to all others, and this book is attempt to put why into words. It offers a brief history of bamboo rod and somewhat less than comprensive list of current makers of them. (But geez.. try and find the magazine he mentions on your local newstand though! ) No it is not a large detailed book nor will it allow the rank beginner to go out and build himself (or herself) a bamboo rod. (At least I would not want to try it on Gierach's book alone). But what it is is a wonderful, very readable book on a often forgotten piece of fishing equipment that every angler should try once. Like upland hunting with a fine double, fly fishing with a bamboo rod just ""feels right"". Its an ""unexplainable"" and no one comes closer to explaining it that John Gierach...."
4,"Good read, inspiring, not as much information as I would lik","John Gierach writes what I like to read, quick and clever(not cute). There is a lot of good stuff in this book, but I would have liked to see real pictures of the old rods and a description of the building process. I'm thinking that what this book really is is a public explanation of a passion that really needs no justification. Either that or the rent is due. For some guys it's motorcycles or guitars or cars. For John it's bamboo(never cane) rods. Thanks John."
4,A Nice Read From a Passionate Expert,"I must say that I was not looking forward to reading this book as I had heard it was dry and lifeless.Well, true enough. It is really not a typical ""Gierach"" book full of interesting stories and insight about the fly fishing life.However, it is a very readable book about the story of the bamboo fly rod and I must say, it is full of interesting history and personal insight. For example, Gierach points out that you can feel a bamboo rod load on the back cast which is something that is difficult to feel with graphite. He is right and I had never noticed that before. His gift is to be able to identify those subtle points in life that we don't normally notice easily. Now I let my bamboo load up before the cast.I may be biased though, with this whole bamboo stuff because I just won't buy anything else now. Graphite is great and it gets the job done but it is like comparing finger painting to a monet hanging on the wall.-John"
3,Thinking of Others First,I've seen this movie around Christmas for the past few years and decided that I wanted it for my collection. It shows people that it's best to think of others and help them out rather than always thinking of yourself first.
2,"Too unbelievable to enjoy, too unenjoyable to buy","This is one of those movies that's OK to watch on TV but not so OK to spend a lot of money on. I agree that the actors weren't so bad but that the script makes for wooden characters. It focuses so much on ""evil Carol"" that it doesn't make for very cheerful watching. This movie could have been much better since the twist idea- a talk show host with a selfish past-is fun...... if Carol was less 2 dimensional. She is just plain....evil up to the bitter end, when SNAP she changes for the better and gets her man."
4,"Light, easy, fun.","Sometimes you just want a movie that isn't real heavy. Something you can enjoy and smile at. This is that kind of movie. Sure, it's the same premise as several other Christmas movie's, but it's still a different take. And Tori Spelling, along with the rest of the cast, make it fun, enjoyable, and good for everyone."
4,Carol Christmas/Christmas Carol,"A clever idea starting with the word-switch.Scrooge is a WOMAN! Equal opportunity evil!What a twist-- and what a B with an ITCH isTori Spelling's character!I have to say that I have never been more thancasually tolerant of Tori supposing -- as some --that her acting career was more due to her highlyimportant HOLLYWOOD FATHER than to h-e-r abilities.Well! I guess we can ALL be wrong. I bought this(Hallmark as I recall)film because I happen to en-joy CHRISTMAS MOVIES year-'round.This fits the bill, and I have put it between theMany Christmas Carol/Scrooge/Scrooged movies in myFAVORITE CHRISTMAS MOVIES area in my man-cave."
3,A Carol Christmas,"I HAVE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT CHRISTMAS CAROL. I ALREADY WATCHED A CAROL CHRISTMAS, BUT I AM SAD, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE THE CLOSED CAPTIONED IN IT. WILLIAM SHATNER WAS VERY GOOD ON THIS."
2,Too Much Carol,"Limp retelling of the Dickens Christmas classic. William Shatner provides the only bright spot as the Ghost of Christmas Present. Tori Spelling proves that, with talent, hard work, and a father who was the most powerful producer in television, anyone can succeed in Hollywood. The rest of the cast is serviceable, but limited by a flat script. Strictly for the pre-teen set or mindset."
5,Great way to step off the grid,"This b&w film melds beautifully with Fred Frith's unusual playing. There's a sense of things just being as they are, rather than rushing to be the newest transformation. As one who is repulsed by commercials and pop advertising, I experienced this DVD as a refuge of sorts; a serene look into the lives and activities of nomads whose every move seems to be linked to their survival. The soundtrack is great, but the silences within the movie are equally compelling. The title is quite appropriate."
4,started working again!!!!,"I bought this camera in 2002 as my 1st digital,just as a point & shoot. It was a great little hard working camera with no problems until 6 months later I accidentally dropped it and it stopped working (ALWAYS WEAR THAT HAND STRAP, I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH! It can get knocked out of your hands and it won't matter how 'tight' your grip on it is). Anyway, I put it away in a drawer and forgot about it. Four years later, my friend said that digital cameras will sometimes start working again if they had a chance to 'rest'. So I put the batteries in,tested it and SURPRISE! It started right up with no problems! Who knew? I'm glad I didn't throw it out. So if it stops working for whatever reason, let it rest for a month and then try it again. See what happens, you never know."
3,Um produto Que nao Tem nada de Mais,"No é uma Sony mas Tira bem as fotos.Mas quem puder comprar um Sony, por favor que compre.Filipe"
4,Opens the door on a very different world,"This history book is very readable and opens the door to contemporary readers on a world that is quite different from ours, yet remarkably similar in some ways. The discussion of a student protest in Paris in 1229, which was brutally crushed by the police under orders of Queen Blanche of Castile, was particularly memorable.The seven chapters that deal with individual women -- a merchant's wife, a commoner, a queen, and so on -- are mistitled a bit, because they deal just as much with broad issues such as the legal disabilities of women in the Middle Ages, their occupations, family life, and land holding."
2,Poor Read,"What a simple title, yet a more simpler book. Very little facts of interest or use, very short and trite, I'd prefer to read the Wives of Henry VIII for the fourth time.Don't get this book, there are much more worthy ones that account the lives of WOMEN in the middle ages, and if you really are looking for women, the women in this book are truely unknown and did not account to much in the middle ages."
2,The book was slow from the begining to the end.,Nothing in the book made any sense to me. There was never a point made. It was all stuff that know one really want to learn about. Overall I didn't like the book at all
4,Gal Costa sings Ary Barroso in her cool style,"Ary Barroso was one the great traditional composers in Brazil. His only international reference is his song ""Brazil"" as recorded by Frank Sinatra besides Carmen Miranda's renditions of some of his songs.So this is an Ary Barroso songbook album.Features Caetano Veloso on ""No Tabuleiro da Baiana"" in a delicious duet with Ms. Costa.Overall, you'll hear Gal Costa in her cool performances of Barroso's material. No brilliant arrangements to feature."
4,Nothing elaborate ---,"- just a nice album. One other guy said it well, a ""Sunday Morning"" type, perhaps - - - not a big deal, but nice.Another nice addition is her ""live from the Blue Note"" -- also very unspectatular, yet, with some really neat chord changes (guitar) and what I'd call semi-delicious, okay?"
2,"It's Secured, what do you want?","This one does not include the recent code changes, however I didn't find those changes drastic enough to make a difference in my Secured class, but then again, we were forced to review Burt Reynolds bankruptcy case in its entirety. For general purposes, understanding basic concepts, this review is fine, just don't forget to study and know the Code updates!"
1,Out of Date,Do not purchase this outline. Its publisher has not updated it to reflect the changes to Article 9 that became effective in 2001.
4,"""80's Horror Classic!""","Catherine Hicks, Chris Sarandon and Brad Dourif starin this 1988 horror film. A boy gets a doll for hisbirthday that's possessed by a killer's soul. Thisis a great film and Brad is excellent as Chucky.This dvd has nice picture and sound plus neatextras. I recommend this 80's horror classic."
4,A Classic Horror Flick !,"One of Tom Holland's best films. Back to the 80's, this movie can be consider a classic of the horror genre. Brad Dourif has the exact voice for killer doll Chucky. It's absolutely perfect. If you didn't watch yet, watch it now !"
4,Childs play,"1988 shocker of a killer who is shot be a cop in a toy store, who then is forced to transfer his soul into a ""good guy doll"" so he would keep from dying and going to hell. Sounds very silly but it is so nicely acted and directed it keeps you yelling for more. And the special effects will truly blow you away-chucky(the good guy doll) walks, talks, and moves so smooth you truly cant tell its a machine. And as it said on the original box cover, Chucky truly is one mean SOB.."
5,Still Scares the Hell Out Of Me,"I don't know how I manage to sit through every single horror movie laughing until my stomach hurts, but I shrivel up whenever this movie is mentioned. I'm giving it five stars because to this day, I STILL will not watch this movie alone. I have this phobia about voodoo and I don't like dolls that have eyes that look too realistic, so watching this movie was a task for me. I recall sleeping in my parent's bedroom through this movie, and I wouldn't be surprised if I couldn't sleep alone NOW as grown as I am. The movie is basically about a doll that came to life and turned out to be evil as hell. I saw a life-sized version of this doll when I went to a haunted house on Halloween awhile back, and as soon as I turned to see it, I went flying past the line, kicked open the door, and ran for two blocks. I got to give whoever created this one much respect for scaring the mess out of me because that's very unusual to do."
5,SPECIAL EDITION PLEASE!!!!!!!,Eventually a special edition will have to come up it has to the region 1 NTSC version of Child's Play is in fullscreen (4*3 1:33:1) which is'nt its original ratio its also quite grainy the region 2 PAL is in un-anamorphic widecsreen (16*9 1:85:1) and they are both in terrible stereo now if MGM did a special edition of Species they can do one of this and if we're lucky anchor bay might buy the rights like they bought Bubba ho-tep off MGM hopefully one or the other will evenyually happen I have given 5 stars for the film for now best bet is to buy the region 2 PAL version
4,Wierd but enjoyable,"I rented this movie and really enjoyed it. It had a great mix of eeriness and dark humor. The story begins as a daranged serial killer is on the verge of death and uses voodoo to transport his soul into a cutesy little doll from a kid's show in the movie. The plot thickens as a woman buys him for her 6 year old son, Andy. The killer then decides to get revenge on numerous people who did him wrong when he was a man. There was, to my supprise, very little gore. A bit of blood but not that much for it's genre. Only four deaths, so most of the scares come from the hard suspense. I was on the edge of my seat for a while. I thought it was very well done for it's time. I would recommend buying or at least renting. It's definitely worth seeing at least once."
3,One of the most enduring horror classics,"Child's Play is one of the most enduring horror classics which still continues to terrify people everywhere today. Although low-budget, Holland has managed to create a seamingly-plausible plot that never loses its touch, and never comes short of sending chills up your spine. Although it seems the adult actors weren't too interested in the film, check out young Andy's performance as the terrified youngster whose dream became a nightmare. Listen for Chucky's remark after an older woman comments on his appearance in the elevator towards the end, and Andy's final(we hope) farewell to Chucky in the fireplace. This is a horror classic which anyone can watch more than once."
1,So Sad...,the ONLY Chucky movie that isn't available in Widescreen is the original. FULL SCREEN??? This Chucky classic deserves a much better DVD treatment than it has received. We can only hope for a reissue.
3,it was okay not what i expected,this movie is really not all that scary chucky only killed 4 people okay here's the story a killer named charles lee ray is on the run cause a ditective named mike noris is chasing him and charles is hiding in a toy store and he falls in to a pile of good guy dolls and he does black magic so he can pocess a good guy doll so a single mother buys chucky from a hobo so she brings chucky home so her son andy can play with him and andy figgures out chucky is alive and so andy is talking to chucky and chucky told andy his real name(charles lee ray)so andy's mother is working and so a baby sitter is watching over andy and later on chucky gets a hammer and hits her in the eye and falls out of the window and andy is the only knows who did it chucky.still pretty good movie you should get it you will pretty much get scared at the part where they all think chucky is dead because andy caute chucky on fire and suddenly chucky tripps andy and you should see what chucky looks like
3,Child's Play,"These movies are okay I guess, although I prefered them when I was 12. I think the movie is kind of funny, They were never scarry to me, I dont know, just something about dolls infront of a camera and crew just doesnt send chills up my spine..."
3,Ok,I have been a fan of Child's Play since i was 5this is my favorite horror series other than Halloweenbut i was disappointed with this Blu-Rayit was really grainy i know it is a older film but they could havedone better they may have put a week's worth into this Blu-Ray at the mostit's not the worst Blu-Ray but i would only buy this if i was a diehard Child's Play fan
3,"Pretty good, but not really scary","I thought this movie was pretty good, and the effects for the time were ok, but I thought this movie was more funny than scary, and apparently the producers must have saw something funny too, cause they made all the other sequel funny on purpose."
5,Very scary...,"Freddy vs Chucky anyone???Freddy wouldn't know what hit him... what if he had Chucky enter his dream!!!Freddy would be trying to kill an innocent blonde when, out of nowhere, Chucky comes in slicing his Brad Pitt/achilles.It'd be great.While a cool story, I highly doubt that a serial killer would be allowed to come back as a doll!!!Karma would have them come back as my niece's pet... now that would be well placed!!!"
2,"GOOD MOVIE, BAD DVD",I love childs play but the format for this dvd version is horrible. IT is in standard instead of widescreen. This normally is not a problem but the PAN AND SCAN transfer is horrible. It goes downhill throughout the movie. Scenes are blurry and badly pixelated. You can only see half of the credits at the end because the screen chops them off. The finale of the movie is bad because you can't see chucky! HE is cut out! Wait for a special widescreen edition or a better film transfer.
3,"Lousy Video Quality, Great Soundtrack","Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.This is about the worst video quality I've ever seen on a Blu-Ray disc. Lot's of grain. I give it 5 out of 10, and hope there is no Blu-Ray with a video quality less than 5.The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack is great."
4,Yes this is scary,"I saw this film when I was 10 years old and I don't remember getting much sleep afterwards. If you want a decent scare I'd recommend this film for it far outways the films that follow. This is a genuine thrill ride with state of the art effects and a creepy as hell plot. A murderer comes back as a doll and starts killing everyone. Brilliance. Too bad it could never be repeated, at least not effectivly."
4,The Best...,"This is the best Child's Play/Chucky movie of all time! It was actuallly HORROR and scared me when I was a kid. This movie deserves to be bought, great acting, great entertainment, great horror. Watch this!!!!!"
4,The best Chucky movie ever,"Forget Seed of Chucky, Bride of Chucky, and the other two sequels that came after this surprisingly good horror romp. Tom Holland (Fright Night) directed this horror romp, in which the soul of a deranged killer inhabits a child's doll. Child's Play manages to boast a few genuine scares and add some creepy atmosphere to boot, with Brad Dourif doing great work as the voice of killer ""good guy"" doll Chucky. I won't go into the plot, since everyone pretty much already knows it, but what I will say is that this is about ten times better than any movie to feature the killer doll released since, and surprisingly the film hasn't aged too badly. All in all, if you've never seen the original Child's Play, give it a try; although I wish the DVD were presented in widescreen."
4,GREAT MOVIE...,THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE. MY KIDS WON'T LET A DOLL STAY IN THEIR ROOMS. CHUCKY HIMSELF (I KNOW IT'S A DOLL) IS SCARY. BUT HAS A SICK SENSE OF HUMOR. KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT WITH YOUR FEET PULLED UP. DEFINETLY A CLASSIC.
1,Very Disappointed,I received the item and the DVD was not properly secure and was just sliding around in the case so it's very badly scratched. I've sent 2 emails and still NO RESPONSE. I'm still wanting a NEW SET. I do not recommend this company to anyone. Horrible Customer Service
5,Good movie,"I remember when this movie came out my cousins bought it. My brother was entering school that year. He watched Child's Play and had nightmares of Chucky. Later on down the line my little cousin, who was the same age as my brother, bought the Chuky doll. My brother wouldn't walk in the house till he new the doll was put away. My brother is now in his 20's. My husband and I bought him the Chucky doll for Christmas last year.... Man you should have seen his face, lol.This is a good scary movie. If you haven't seen it it is a must see."
2,Chucky SUCKED!,"Viewed: 7/05Rate: 37/05: Child's Play is a lame horror film with the same formula that has been tried once too many times. But this time, the plot involves a doll. Child's Play is a disguise of Friday the 13th at its best. How pathetic is that: a spoiled kid that gets what he wants? No wonder why I am rooting for the bad guy. Chris Sarandon gives a nice performance which helped Child's Play from being a total trash. Probably the worst part about Child's Play, when it comes to annoying characters, Chucky the doll tops the odious boy from Problem Child. I am surprised and disappointed there was much profanity in Child's Play especially when there is a young kid actor in it."
2,8th day of christmas 2011 review,"On the 8th day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...Child's Play. There are so many plotholes in this film that I can't type them all in one sitting. The acting is terrible at best. The premise is preposterous & stupid. The devices that made Chucky look like he was real are faulty at best. Worst of all,even thought the cast saids that Chucky's body is becoming more human,he can still move & LIVE without a head,with one arm and with only one leg. They to shoot it like a million times before he goes down for the count for good. Overall,while it is scary for some people,it's dated at best. I give this movie a 2 and a half out of 10."
1,a gross & most terrifing movie!!!!!! Mar.8 1999,This is so scary that I can't go to bed with out having nightmares about it!!I'm 8 years old.I have always had a thought about a doll with a knife.I have a scary doll at my house that almost looks exactly like Chuckie.I'm telling children around the age of 5to12 avoid CHILD'S PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I mean it!
3,One of the most enduring horror classics,"Child's Play is one of the most enduring horror classics which still continues to terrify people everywhere today.

This is a horror classic which anyone can watch more than once. Makes me want to go to Kay-Bee Toys (yeah right!)."
3,this movie is clever and frightening,"The scariest film with a doll is this 1988 thriller about a serial killer who transfered his soul in a doll called Chucky and when a boy discovers Chucky's a monster he starts bloody murders of mayhem to anyone mean to him.Director Tom Holland directs a cool horror film since his 1985 film Fright Night,this film has enough suspense and violence to scare viewers and at times throws comedic overtones in Chucky's wisecracks."
3,It's Ok.,"I like Catherine Hicks and Chris Sarandon and though Child's Play was kind of hokey I thought it was ok, I like that it had some scary parts but wasn't too gory."
3,"A Fun, Enjoyable Film","Child's Play deals with a killer dying and entering his soul into a children's doll in a toy store. The doll, Chucky, is given to a little boy named Andy as a present by his mom. The doll comes to life and starts knocking people off. He wants to enter his soul into a human body before he's trapped in the doll's body forever. This movie is a lot of fun. It is filled with pretty good suspense and acting. At one moment it's thrilling, and the next it's kind of funny. Alex Vincent, who plays Andy, is not the greatest kid actor, but he's fine. Catherine Hicks, who plays his mom, is the best of the bunch. Fans of her work as the mother on TV'S ""7TH Heaven"" will be surprised. Brad Douriff as the killer and Chris Sarandon as the cop who killed him, round out the cast. All used well. The steam was sort of missing from the sequels, but they were all enjoyable nonetheless. Not great, but fun. Child's Play is a simple, enjoyable little film. Give it a try."
3,Clever little chiller,"With the concept of a serial killers spirit being transfered into the form of a cute childrens doll, Child's play has the unnerving ability of playing on many young childrens (adults too, as we were once there) fear of ""what if...my toy doll was actually alive"". Andy's new bithday present is far from the innocent, wholesome idea of good simple child's play, this doll in particular has other ideas, ideas which involve a couple of murders and the eventual possesion of it's young owners body. Cleverly written and often quite scary, however the end sequence tends to go on and on, purely playing out for shock tatics rather than logic."
3,One of the funniest horror movies ever,A rather cheesy and amusing plot about a serial killer who gets his soul transfered from his dead body to a good guy doll at a local toy store. This movie did quite a good job of making a decent horror movie and adding a spice of humour to it. Lots of fun all the way. Followed by three quite impressive sequels.
3,"Hi, i'm Chucky, wanna play ?","The movie begun when a psycho killer Charles Lee Ray ( Brad Dourif ) transfer his soul to a Good Guy doll to he don't die. After that, Karen Barclay ( Catherine Hicks ) give to her six-years old son Andy ( Alex Vincent ) the same doll. After, mysterious murders are around the doll and the boy, and the private detective who is taken care of the cases Mike ( Chris Sarandon ) start to suspect of the little boy...."
2,"Does not pass the ""80s"" test.",Unfortunately this film does not hold up after 25 years.I just could never get into the 'killer doll' genre and take it seriously. Diff'rent strokes for different folks i guess.
5,Top Quality Movie,"This movie was made nearly 17 years ago and still manages to make me jump. The idea of having a serial killer come back to life in the body of a doll is great. Even the knife wielding antics of Chucky (The Doll) are excellent. The special effects are quite good for their time and strangely enough are quite believeable. Just dont turn the lights off and watch this movie or you will be looking over your shoulder for days watching out for your teddy bear with a knife in its hand. All in all the movie is fantastic. Just a pity all the sequels were not as good as the original although I havnt seen ""Seed of Chucky"" yet. ENJOY...."
4,An inventive and original horror film with class,"Child's play is a very inventive film that takes a simple premise of a walking talking malevolent doll and turns into an interesting , suspensful supernatural\thriller. Directed by Tom Holland the man behind Fright Night , this an entertaining classic horror film aided by a compulsive mood and Brad Dourif's uniqe sound as Chucky the doll. The sequels are nice , but not up to par.."
4,A very fun slasher flick!,"From the back of the DVD:After 6-year-old Andy Barclay's babysitter is violently pushed out of a window to her death, no one believes him when he says ""Chucky,"" his new birthday doll, did it! Until things start to go terribly wrong...dead wrong. And when an ensuing rampage of gruesome murders lead a detective back to the same toy, he discovers that the real terror has just begun...the deranged doll has plans to transfer his evil spirit into a living human being - young Andy!I bought this film on DVD without even renting it first. On the way home, I kept wondering if it was a mistake to do that. Well, it wasn't. The special effects were stunning for a late 80's film and it had a very unique character in it, Chucky. The acting though was great at some parts and horrible at others. There wasn't much gore or a high body count, but the movie is still pretty fun to watch. I give it an 4 out of 5."
4,Up there with Freddy and Jason,"This was a great horror film.Chucky is up there with all the cool horror villons like Michel Myers,Terminator, Jason,Leatherface, and freddy. The movie about a crook who gets shot but puts his soul into a ""Good Guy"" doll so he can get his revenge on the people who killed him. I know that sounds really really bad but it'smuch better than it sounds. The movie has a slow beging but gets really good. Like all horror flims it had three sequels and thefirst one is still the best. This movie is really cool and if you like getting scared you will love this, it's great."
2,"4 stars for the movie, 0 stars for the DVD - NO WIDESCREEN!!",Why did the sequels to this get better treatment than this original classic!? Reminds me of the Vacation sequels. Release this DVD in widescreen format or you'll get no money from me.
3,WHAT!!!!Only released in Full Screen!!!!,There are two reasons why Child's Play didnt get five stars from me.One:There are no special features what so ever(i love it when DVDs have two disks).Two:ONLY IN FULL SCREEN.MGM needs to release this in widescreen format very soon.
4,Wanna play?,"Chiild's Play is a good horror movie with great special effects and some genuinely scary moments. Everyone in the cast is excellent. Gore is minimal and there is no sex or nudity, making this a tasteful horror film. The DVD only has a trailer, so hopefully there will be a special edition. The musical score will send shivers down your spine."
3,"Great Horror/ Comedy, Poor DVD","This movie to me is one of the most humorous horror movies ever made. I would say it is right up there with Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness as it pertains to comedy. The story line is basic and has many holes but all in all it is a fun movie. Not really scary, but some great one liners. Chuckie is a smaller version of Arnold with the one liners and a foul mouth. The DVD is just awful that is why I deducted two stars. Full Screen, Why? I do not want a modified version to fit my screen I want to see the whole movie as it was presented in the theatres. Plenty of artifacting and color bleeds. The blacks are not sharp and the brightness tends to shift. It appears they copied this right from the same source material they used for the VHS release. Come MGM you could have cleaned it up a bit. The audio was also inferior going through peaks and valleys. Hopefully they will re-release this as a special addition and clean it up the way it should have been for this release!"
3,Good movie but you wont be watching it alot,i paid $10 for this dvd and shamelessley i only watched it once ive never seen the first chucky movie and i relyed on the reviews so i bought it and kinda regret it. But the extras are pretty tight so i gave it 3 stars
5,For the bird lover!,"What a joy to wake up to birds singing! We already have an ""Indentiflyer"" and all the bird song cards for birds that live in our region.Birdsong Identiflyer Portable Audio Birdsong GuideWhen we saw this clock, made by ""Identiflyer"", I told my wife I wanted one. She put this in my Easter basket. (Yes, after 25 years of marriage, and even though the kids are out of the house, we still make up Easter baskets for one another.) I wake up to this alarm clock in the morning. I have the volume turned down because it can play very loud. (Some have left reviews saying this clock isn't very loud. Perhaps they have an older version...perhaps they need a loud, obnoxious alarm to wake them...perhaps they need to get to bed earlier so they don't sleep through their alarm!) I'm delighted with the clock. It's the best gift I've received in years."
5,Great! Helps for Work and Birders.,"This clock is great for workers when it's time to get up and go to work. It does not play just one bird call. It will play more until you turn the clock off.Also, it helps birders with their identification of birds.I'm a birder and I practice bird calls. This is great to wake up to and practice so when I'm birding, I'll wake up to the bird calls and be able to identify which bird is calling."
3,"Not Sturdy, But Fine For What It Is","This clock runs on batteries. It reminds me of the travel alarm clocks you can buy for about $10, except that it, of course, reads Identiflyer cards.That it is fully compatible with Identiflyer cards is a big plus. However, I have significant concerns about the sturdiness of this clock. I don't think it would survive a drop from a nightstand, and its controls and display are, in a word, discount.If you really want an alarm clock that plays bird sounds, this is about it. It's very pricey given its low-quality parts and limited functionality."
2,really shouldn't be called an alarm clock,"Ok,this item is very well made. It is not heavy, but the workmanship is nice. I got the optional ac adapter, so don't have to worry about batteries. I thought it would be nice to wake to something different in the mornings, but I guess I'll have to keep looking. The volume is low, so it never rouses me. I don't know for sure if the alarm repeats for a period of time, or just goes through the card once, because it hasn't waken me up once this entire first week I've tried using it. The speaker is in back, so it isn't projecting any sound forward. I would not buy it as an alarm clock if you aren't going to add it to a collection of them."
2,Not what it used to be,"I had this same bird clock for many years. When it accidentally fell off my nightstand and broke, I decided to buy the exact same clock since I was so pleased with it in the past.However, it is not the same, and not just in appearance. This one, though it looks similar, is more cheaply made. Compared in weight, it is must lighter and more ""plastic"" looking. The casing on my previous bird clock was a silver color, whereby this one is a dark gray lightweight plastic.To advance time or alarm times, you cannot just hold the button down to scroll to the desired hour or minute. You now have to hit the button individually for each hour or minute desired.So the price has remained the same, but the quality has deteriorated."
1,Batteries are not working for this clock,"Although the appearance of this alarm clock is attractive, and bird idea is interesting, the clock does not worth to buy, because it is not working from any batteries. The owner has already included additional page with information that not every batteries will work for the clock and added instructions of how to break plastic separators between the batteries'' placeholders to make better contact for the batteries. I fallowed the instructions, and it did not help at all. It looks like there is bad design from inside and batteries just cannot make the right contact in their placeholders. I was very disappointed, because I ordered this alarm clock both, from Amazon.com and from Identiflyer with the same result. I returned both alarm clocks. The owner contacted me and promised to send me working one, but I am not sure I will do any business with this company anymore.Svetlana Plummer"
4,Singing alarm clock,I did by the adapter to plug it in a a few extra bird cards. I really enjoy waking up to the sound of birds every morning. It brings a little sunshine to cold Wisconsin winters. Over all it is a good product and I am glad I bought it.
2,"Too Bad, It sounded promising",I have never played a game that crashed so often. Very frustrating. it was fun until it would crash the first time in a one hour session. But the second time in a one hour session is just Ridiculous. dont know if it is the programing or starforce but its frustrating. The game was fun for a while then became very repetitive .
2,bugs and starforce,"This game is from the makers of Sea Dogs, and Sea Dogs II which was retitled Pirates of the Caribbean. This game is very similar to Sea Dogs II (POTC) with some graphical improvements. This game has some serious stability issues, I crashed to the desktop 5 times the first day of playing it, several times losing alot of progress. It was version 1.4 when I installed it so I figured they would have most of the stability issues worked out, apparently I was wrong. The game also uses StarForce copy protection, which has inspired several boycotts among gamers. In Sea Dogs II there was a hotkey to speed up the passage of time while maneuvering your ship or waiting for your cannons to reload, there is no such hotkey in this game, very annoying because sea battles can get long and drawn out especially when you are trying to run."
1,Age of Pirates,I canceled my order for Age of Pirates because it contains StarForce. I would suggest you check out StarForce on the web because it may be something that you do not want on your computer. You can also find on the web a list of computer games that contain StarForce & a debate about what StarForce can do to your computer.I was disappointed to find out about StarForce in Age of Pirates because I looked forward to this game for a long time.Jim Kraus
1,Starforce...,Been playing Sid Meier's Pirates for over a year now and was looking forward to a different game with the same theme. Too bad it won't be this one due to Starforce!The Sid Meijer is great if you need your pirate fix! I'll just pass on this and wait for the multiplayer: Pirates of the Burning Sea.
4,A-HOY,"You like sea battle games then you want this. the best graphics i've seen for old-like games. Combat is amazing and intense. I,m not a fan of the deck battle or sword combat. similar to mount and blade."
1,Don't Buy This,"I purchased this game ""Age or Pirates: Caribbean Tales"" and the game has StarForce Protection which won't allow the game to be installed and or played on my computer, my computer is brand new top of the line, worth $3,500 retail, so it's not because of the computer. Save yourself the time and money and do not purchase this game."
3,Controls need remapping,The over all freedom and story line during the game is good. But the controls are jumbled and placed randomly. The game takes to long to get used to unless you have a gaming keyboard.
3,Age of Pirates Purchase....,"I thought that this game was well put together.... BUT.... There is little support for this title and no matter what I try the game freezes every 20-30 minites. I tore apart the ""Support Site"" to no avail trying every fix that was suggested. There is absolutely nothing wrong with my PC. The thing is brand new as of the start of this year. I have it professionaly checked out with no problems detected. I have all the latest drivers, plenty of RAM, and hard drive space. Unfortunately I fear that this game will collect dust upon a shelf. Perhaps if a patch was published this would not be this games fate. If a part two was put out I hope that it performes better. I in no way place any blame upon the seller of this product. I reserve that for the manufacturer."
4,No Problem,I don't know why some people have a problem with Starforce. I have never had a problem well running a game with Starforce. Age of Pirates is a good in depth game.A lot better then Sids Pirate remake. It would be nice if Amazon would list in the product information if a program is using Starforce for those who do have a problem with it.
2,HARMLESS FLUFF,"""Campus Man"" isn't quite sure what kind of a movie it wants to be. It appears to be a comedy at first glance but that is rather deceiving. In fact, it would've played a lot better if it had been more serious in tone. The ""funny"" parts are typical 80's cheesiness and aren't very witty. The plot involves an Arizona State University student who owes $10,000 in tuition and has 30 days to come up with it. He decides to produce a male athlete calendar in order to try and make enough money to pay his tuition and hopefully have some left over. Of course, things don't go exactly as planned and trouble ensues. Uneasy mix of comedy with some serious issues makes ""Campus Man"" an uneven disappointment. A harmless time filler, however, if you can catch it on TV."
3,reflection of the 80's,"A good movie for a reflection of the 80's. A great cast. This movie helped launch john dye's career, although not sure what happened to steve lyon? a must see movie."
3,"20 great rock spoofs,bad production","This is Apologetix's first albulm,oringinaly on tape in 1994,but rerealeased on cd in 1999.Being their first recording,the production is pretty bad,but they spoof great old classic rock songs,like Queen,Batchmen turner overdrive,Rolling stones,Arosmith,Led Zeplin and others(20 songs) This is not their best release,so if you just want a great release,buy one of their newer records(spoofernatural,keep the change)but if your a fan like me,this album is a must for your collection."
5,Standards,"Chet baker plays standards in this wonderful mid-50s record, the best of the four released under the title ""In Paris"". He sings only in the last track, ""Everything happens to me"", a wonderful rendition. A good intro for new fans."
4,very informative,"I thought it was an excellent book, although I also bought the Essential African Grey at the same time and the later is basically newer revised edition of the former book. Much of the text is exactly the same for less money."
1,Good for a story and that's it.!,The book is well written I can't deny that.. but the author seems too obsessed with her female Grey called Sinbad.. she doesn't even know that Sinbad is an Arabic name for males and not females. The photos indicate that the author is fond of cheap as most of the cages portrayed are offensively so. She even recommends that Birds be allowed to play with Screws and Bolts for toys.
4,An excellent introduction to Glazunov's symphonies,"Glazunov has a reputation for being a prolific but boring and academic composer. While I am not familiar with enough of his works to pass judgement on him as a composer, I can say that I really enjoyed this disc, especially the fifth symphony. I'm a big fan of the Russian symphonic tradition of which Glazunov's fifth is a worthy member. His eighth symphony, while not quite as good as the fifth, does have it's moments. At the Naxos price I would recommend this disc as an excellent introduction to Glazunov's symphonies."
1,Bad Purchase,I only received on respone stating he didn't have the item I purchased but he could still get it. 1 month later I still haven't received the item purchased and requested my money back. Will never use this site again.
4,Great for my son,"My son, who is five, enjoys this game. He like that the disney characters are the ones actually playing golf."
3,How in the world do two players play this game?,"I bought this game for my 5-year-old. It seems okay, despite the silly ""power-ups,"" but I can't for the life of me figure out how two people can play. I select a game, then I select ""2 players."" I next select a character for player #1 and one for player #2. When play begins, though, it's a one-player game. The directions are not helpful in the least. Any ideas?"
3,QUESTIONS ON DISNEY GOLF,I AM THINKING OF BUYING THIS FOR MY 4 YEAR OLD GRANDSON. ARE THERE DIFFERENT SKILL LEVELS? WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THIS FOR A FOUR YEAR OLD? IS IT ANYTHING LIKE PUTT PUTT GOLF?
4,Eye Candy for the Cinema Buff!,"Here is a well-rounded, nicely illustrated guide to classic Hollywood flicks from the '30s to the 1960s. In terms of coverage, there aren't many surprises; all the ""usual suspects"" are here but as an introduction to some ageless films, it's a nice piece of work.Author Afton Fraser divides the films into various chapters: Must See, Drama, Suspense, Film Noir, Good Guys & Bad Guys, Comedy, Screen Teams and so on. Each film typically gets two pages of coverage, a mixture of text and four-six photos. Aside from a short plot summary, brief production notes, information on the stars and tidbits on the movie are given. Each section is preceded by a one-two page summary on why Fraser picked the films found in that section.The book is sub-titled 'A Guide for the Beginner and the Afficionado.' I think it would be most useful for those people wanting to learn about America's rich cinematic history.Recommended."
5,Fantastic!,"This up-and-coming band has produced some it's finest work yet. This CD is a must have! I especially like ""Do It Again""."
4,Let's Get It On- - - - - Not Bad First Release,"If your are into the whole rap metal scene that The Step Kings are a band that you should add to your list. They keep great beats and rock the house. If you are into Roadrunner Records this is one of the better bands on the label I think. Now they are no Slipknot or Machine Head but they kick butt. If you like Papa Roach, Primer 55, or Reveille you will like The Step Kings."
3,"Well, fun but average CD","I first heard this track At Orlando in a party. La Bomba is the best track of this CD, the others are rather average. Nevertheless, it is good for party. It's worth buying for this !"
3,An enigma remains elusive.,"I'm divided on ""Misfit."" I'm relieved that the book isn't an 800 page hagiography, relentless detailing every awful event in Exley's life. What a candidate he would be for that kind of treatment, apparently! Yet in abandoning traditional biographic approaches like chronicling dates and places and keeping it freeform, Yardley goes up against some awesome competition for chronicling Exley's life: Exley himself, in A Fan's Notes, Pages from a Cold Island, and Last Notes from Home. I enjoyed this book but it seemed a little breezy, an homage to the elusive Exley rather than any definitive tackling of his ""strange"" life. A Fan's Notes still rules!"
3,One last drink with Fred Exley.,"Jonathan Yardley's book isn't a great one, but having stumbled upon ""A Fan's Notes"" like a hungry man at a banquet, ""Misfit"" was that last after-dinner drink I just couldn't refuse. Yardley helps us decifer the hazy border between fact and fiction, and ponders the enigma of how a loser like Exley could write a novel of such penetrating power. For those who finish ""A Fan's Notes"" wishing for more, this short bio is probably preferable to Exley's unsuccessful later works."
2,a missed opportunity,"Any fan of Exley's A Fan's Notes will be disappointed in this book. Exley spoke informally to so many people for so many years, but few of those words seem to remembered by anyone. There is too much speculation as to Exley's sex life that adds nothing to our understanding of this marvelous writer. Instead we get the standard biographer's suppositions that just hang there without justification. That people loved Exley is obvious. That he was self-destructive has been documented by his writing. Yardley apparently had a good idea to write about Exley, but a good idea and a publisher's contract is a flimsy excuse for the appearance of this book"
5,The first 100 years of Judo,The first 100 years of Judo is a great and very historical DVD to own for just it's rare footage of Judo. The explaination and breakdown of the history of Judo is very interesting and gives you more of an understanding of this art.
4,I'M CAT DADDY,"Bill Bellamy performs original material. His topics include:Michael JacksonRappersCaliforniaWhite People NewsDogsAtlanta strip clubTaking a bath and oral sexHis humor uses the F-bomb, but unlike so many of his counterparts does not rely on it. What Bill failed to do was to ""bring it home"" with the big laugh at the end. Comedians normally try to end on a big laugh by using earlier material and connecting it to the final laugh."
2,Too Distinct a Distinction,"The Law-Gospel distinction in this book is exaggerated. This book is useful to understand the views of Lutherans but of very little practical use. There is no interaction with difficult texts such as Revelation 14:6-7 and Galatians 3:21. Each of the six tests have simple counterexamples.In the end this book does provide a method of determining whether something is ""Law"" or ""Gospel"" but the distinction is not all that useful."
5,WOW.,"Sylvia Plath fans -- no, I don't mean those college girls who read ""The Bell Jar"" once or twice, but the many obsessive Plathogens who gobble up every biography of her life -- will find this book to be the shot of heroin that every addict craves.Janet Malcolm tracks down Plath's contemporaries, gawks at Plath's homes in England and basically fulfills the wishes of every Sylvia Plath lunatic who wants somehow to live part of her tragic, poetic life. Brava, brava!"
1,"who is this book about, anyway?","""Silent Woman"" gives the innocent book-buyer the impression that it is a biography of Sylvia Plath. Alas, such is not the case. I'm still trying to figure out if it is a history of how ""Bitter Fame"", the controversial biography of Plath, was written and published, or a sob story that blatantly takes sides in a biography-as-gossip sheet sort of way. To say this reader was disappointed is a gross understatement; the book has very little actual information about the intended subject, and leaves the reader with an altogether unsatisfied feeling."
1,A Biography of Biographers,"This was a terrible disappointment. Having recently read the Bell Jar, I was fascinated with Sylvia Plath. The author simply talks about how she talked to various SP biographers and what they thought and did. Hardly touched on SP and what really went on in her life (as best as one could know). Ted Hughes is a non-entity except some silent evil force. How can you state in the title ""Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes"" when essentially nothing of any substance is really written about them? This book follows no chronological order and is awful. What a lazy excuse for some nouveau (?)kind of biography. It comes off like a very trite, poorly written yet pompous piece from an off-issue of Vanity Fair. There are much better biographies out there. The best place to really start is with The Bell Jar. I can't believe I bought this book!"
1,Silent Women: Slvia Plath Ted Hughes,"I did not want to read the history of other Plath biographers. I was disappointed. The book was all psychoanalytical speculation; I think it is quite presumptuose to think you can say, why another person dose anything. the continuous justifications to statments made became tiresome. I got the empression the author wanted to include herself in the drama, it is Plath's and Hughes story I wanted to hear. I particularly did not like the retelling of petty complaints, such as ""slvia helped herself to food in my refridgerater."" If the author in deed thought these remarks were not worthy of being in a biography, then why give a second life to them? I felt that the book was forcing me to take sides, Plath or Hughes. By making one right, one must be wrong. Yuck! I was left with the feeling the book was written by a mean competitive jealous person."
1,Tabloid Minds,"This book is a gossip columnists conception of what literary biography is, and shows that Amazon amatuers should return to advertising or circuit boards."
5,great book on the biography and sylvia plath,"Malcolm has written a great book on the difficulties of writing a good and fair biography. She uses Sylvia Plath, and specifically Anne Stevenson's Bitter Fame as her example. What you get here is an interesting book that engages the reader and at times almost reads like a novel. The book is gripping and before you know it, you've finished it. Also, Malcolm claims to be on the ""side"" of Ted Hughes, but I still think she gives a fairly balanced view of the whole situation. But, this isn't a biography of Sylvia Plath. This is a biography of a biography."
2,A high end look with way too much high end.,"From a distance these things have the look of well crafted head phones.Up close it's easy to see that they are cheaply made.Bottom line: Way too much high end. Its distracting and sometimes painfull. I've heard sounds more true to reference from headphones that are a third the price. Save up a little more cash, do some research, and get the real deal."
5,Fantastic Sound and Comfort at This Price Point,"Very comfortable for my large head, excellent separation and detail even on my iPod, even better though the radio. I love taking naps with these on my head. They're open so people nearby can hear them, but I'm overall very happy with these. Highest recommendation."
3,Excellent,The book is a definite source of information for people who are new to JSP. It provides lots of examples and illustrations to understand the concepts in a better way. I found it to be very informative.
4,worked great for 2 years and then quit,"I really like this product - it is very small, works well on the airplane, and does a decent job at active noise reduction while listening to the in-flight entertainment. I much prefer having these in my ears instead of the headphones that go over the ears and become painful after several hours.The only complaint I have is that I can't hear anything now - after two years of use, I would have hoped it would have lasted longer; however, since I do like the product, I'm buying a 2nd one.Koss QZ-77 Active Noise Reduction Ear Plug System"
1,Clunky,"I returned this to Amazon, exchanging it for another set of earphones. I had not realized that it is designed as it is, with that little box attached. What does one do with the little box? This is a bad design."
1,These earrings are junk and I am ashamed I gave them for a gift.,"I bought these for my wife for x-mas based on their picture. They arrived, she put them on. Both earings had the stones fall out and frame break within a half a day. They are junk and the company that sent them cannot be trusted. Be careful!!!"
1,BLUE topaz?!!!???!!!,Come on! I thought they had erroneously mailed out CZs! These earrings dont have even the faintest tinge of blue in them! What a RIP! The sterling silver was nice and well-constructed but i purchased these earrings on the strength of what i thought were the dazzling blue topaz stones. Quite a disappointment! I had to buy an emergency back-up Christmas gift for my best friend!
1,HITNF,"I expect nothing but greatness from this band. This CD more than failed to deliver. The only good song is the first one. The rest is QR trying to be an alternative band. This is an absolute change in sound and songwriting for this band. I'm all for bands evolving, but there is such a thing as taking it too far. I traded my copy at CD Warehouse for something else."
2,Lackluster.,"Hear In The Now Frontier is a real disappointment, it almost sounds more bland and generic every time you listen to it. There are some good songs like Sign Of The Times and Get A Life, Voice Inside isn't bad either but the rest is forgettable. It's too much the opposite of classic Queensryche, they were original and technical but this is bland and simple. The songs sound too bloated and dreadful, yet flat and boring. At least Q2K doesn't sound that bad."
3,I WISH it was better,"I don't believe this CD deserves the ridicule the band has endured as a result of producing it, but they've done better and know it. They went in a different direction - before Chris Degarmo called it quits entirely. Perhaps his effort was half-baked, making some of the songs mediocre. Some songs are still very cool and creative. The last CD from the band worth paying retail for."
2,Save your money for a better album.,"I am not someone who is listening to this band for the first time. I grew up listening to Queensryche. This was the only album I did not have in my collection. When I finally got it, it was a huge dissapointment. The music sounds nothing like Queensrche has ever produced. Sure the lyrics to most of the songs are great, but how Geoff sings them, and the guitar parts. . .well. . .just did not live up to the band's reputation. Every great band makes a mistake in their career, and this will hopefully be their only one.Two good alternatives for this album are Tribe and the ever famous Operation:Mindcrime.Please. . .just save your money."
5,Losing Isaiah/purchased through amazon.com,"""...awsome copy!...it's a great film, with great acting from Halle & Jessica....thanx for the connection amazon.com!...it's great doin business with you!"
4,"Great Drama, Questionable Storyline","Actually, this is more like 3 1/2 stars. This one makes for great drama, but is it really realistic? Berry, Lange, Jackson and the others give fine performances, but would this, or at least should this case have ever even gone to court? The woman put the kid in the garbage for godsakes! In my opinion any parent (Black, White or otherwise) who puts their child in the garbage for whatever reason, permanently forfeits the right to care for the child. I don't think the case ever should have gone to trial. But then there wouldn't have been any movie, would there?"
3,got a beard?,"if you are weighing the benefits of this silk sweater and those of cotton or wool, and you have a beard, you might consider selecting the latter. i purchased this sweater in brown and one in black, favoring silk for travel, but the sweater quickly showed signs of wear from contact with my trimmed beard.the sweater is beautiful and perfect for taking in a suitcase, but don't skip a date with your razor."
5,"Wow, they can count to six!","Wow, they can actuality count to six as in the ""SIXTH SEASON"" Why I thought maybe they just couldn't count that high LOL. Now why O' why must they take so long to get these ""All In The Family"" season out when all the other shows are on there 5,6,7 + season already Hummm?"
3,Not as satisfying as the other seasons!,"I am grateful to own this sixth season, but the episodes are not as funny as other seasons. The best episodes on the set were The birth of the baby episodes and the female impersonator episode. I am looking forward to own season seven. Hopefully we won't have to wait long."
3,Start of the Decline,"Short and to the point: Season six of ALL IN THE FAMILY is still better than any other show at the time (sit-com), but this season ranks poorly in my opinion to the classic first five seasons of the show.Don't get me wrong; It's still the greatest show of all time in my book, but i like season seven better thatn season six.Season six has too many episodes that center at Mike and Gloria's house, and it just isn't the same.Not enough Archie.There were still great episodes in this season and many more to come in following seasons, but this is I believe the last year the show ranked at number one in the ratings, and just by benefit of pedigree at this point.It certainly doesn't rank with the previous number 1 ranking seasons."
4,"""A season of changes""","The 1975-76 season of ""AITF"" saw Mike & Gloria (Rob Reiner & Sally Struthers) moving into thwir own home,which happened to belong to The Jeffersons,who had left the previous season-Mike & Gloria also became parents of a boy named Joey-One of the funniest episodes of this season is when Archie sneaks Joey off to get baptized despite protests from Mike & Gloria-This would be the final season in which ""AITF"" would dominate the top spot in the Neilsen ratings-Every episode is a winner."
5,"Funny, somewhat gruesome, and touching!","I love the wit and the heart of Polly Horvath's work. The author is fascinated by how people can blossom into true individuals, free from the expectations and demands of family, friends, and society in general. She celebrates the unique people we meet in life who help us become who we really are. In The Canning Season, those unique characters are so vividly drawn that they feel like old (and very eccentric) friends. You will remember them long after you turn the final page."
4,Canning Season,"Hilarious fun read; quirky and strange yet rewarding tale of one summer that changed a girl's destiny. Ratchet is a forced recluse whose mother is obsessed with being admitted into the Hunt Club a Florida country club, Ratchet's mother Henrietta only cares about the Hunt club and keeps Ratchet from making friends because of a mysterious birth mark, referred to as that ""thing"". Ratchet without warning is sent away for the summer to live with some very old women in woods filled with bears. The style of this book is great, similar to Roald Dahl and just as lively. This is a great family read."
1,Disappointing,I sense that some children's books are written to impress adults (especially those on award committees) rather than to entertain kids. This is one of them.
1,"oh, please!",It seems to me that the author is so busy writing clever dialog and witty train-of-thought that she forgot to write the story.boring... i put it down half way through ... so tiresome that i couldn't even go to sleep with it .... disappointing
2,very boring,"Not The best of the Free albums ,in spite of some good songs ""little bit of love"" being one , this album does not grab me as the others do."
3,Free - 'Free At Last' (Universal),"Originally released in 1972,as this was never considered to be one of Free's best work,but it is decent.Looks to be the band's last lp with bassist Andy Fraser and guitarist Paul Kossoff(R.I.P.).You get the album's nine tracks,plus six(6)bonus cuts of mostly alternative edits of the lp's tracks.Tunes here I liked best were ""Catch A Train"",""Magic Ship"",""Travellin' Man"" and their Stone's cover of ""Honky Tonk Woman"".Shouldn't to hard to locate a copy of."
1,Such a poor finish...,"I'm a big Free fan so it's hard to admit that 'Free at last' is a very disappointing album. After the great songs found in Free's earlier works, this patchy effort is merely a haphazard collection of various left over song ideas which have been tossed together in the musical salad bowl that is this album. Fraser's bass lines plod along... where is the prowesss / mastery demonstrated in 'Mr Big'? Kossoff plays as though he is half asleep, Rodgers sounds tired. Kirke's drumming is the only redeeming feature of this album. The remastered album contains one good 'bonus' track... a honky tonk piano based rehearsal of the Stones' 'Honky Tonk Woman'. This album is for fanatical fans only who can't bear to see a vacant space in their Free CD collection...buy Free live instead..."
4,"not my first choice, but good performance","the album is of the label royal classics. Good performance. This symphony is somewhat long, but fine."
3,Maroon 5 makes me wonder,"Maroon 5 has had a transformation of sorts since their ""Songs that are lame"" debut. Frontman Adam Levine still thinks he's the Almighty's gift to women (or maybe the Brahman/Atman's,since he practices yoga with his bandmates) ""Makes me wonder"" takes on a disco beat,it's catchy and toe-tapping. It's a non-annoying Maroon 5 song. A MIRACLE!It opens with the ""feels so good to be bad"",a perfect accompaniment to an illicit love scene. There's some useless (but non-instrusive) cussing, but it's an overall strong song. It's bubblegum pop;good at it what does. Who knew that Adam Levine's annoying falsetto could actually be FUN to listen to? It DOES make me wonder."
4,Solid stuff.,"Makes Me Wonder - 4.5 stars. <3 the F-Bombs!Way I Was - 4 stars.Nothing more to say than that Adam is decently attractive and simply shines at what he does: crooning. I just miss the R&B-based; tracks that they used to have...THE SUN, SECRET and RAG DOLL anyone?Cover Art: A+Inside Art: ? (Will get the album, will never own this!)Songwriting: B-Vocals: C-Vocal Emotion: B-Production: B+Length: A-4.25 stars.Overall: B-"
2,"Bought two, one broke.","I bought this radios with great expectations. The small size and big range were very appealing.First, the sound quality was terrible; you could barely understand person on the ""other"" side. It was worse when compared side by side with a radio from a popular brand.Then (right after the warranty expired, ofcourse) one of the two radios gave up. I called Audiovox for service and the cost of repair was about 70% of the cost of the new one. They were both thrown away.I gave one extra star, just because I still believe that the concept of slim radios is worth pursuing."
1,Less quality than I was expecting.,"It is a very attractive cutting board but it consists of three pieces of wood, the middle piece being the biggest. This allows for significant warping when left lying down. This board has to be dried on edge. I guess I was expecting thicker better quality.On the positive side, it is quite big and relatively light weight so its easy for my Wife and Daughter to use but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,5-stars to 1 star in 2 weeks,"When my cutting board arrived and I began to use it, I was very satisified with it's size, looks, functionality, etc. That was my opinion when it first arrived -- and for about 2 weeks thereafter. Then the board began to warp. It is still usable, but it has gone from a 5-star item to a 1-star dud. I am very disappointed and am looking for a replacement."
3,So-So,This is the 2nd or 3rd one we've had. We keep wearing them out. Not real crazy about the blond wood because it stains so easily. The size is good though.
4,Nice cutting board,I use this cutting board for over the sink cutting board. I have double sinks and this board fitsjust right over one of the single sinks. I use the back side of the board because it doesn'thave the juice groove on the back side. It does have shallow finger holds on each end of the boardwhich isn't a problem for me. It does have a tendency to slide around some on my counter top.It is a nice looking board and I am pleased that I purchased it.
3,ok,Used it for some times. 2 glue joints has an 1 inch long gap appeared. But it does not break apart yet.
3,"OK, but...","I've had this board for 3 1/2 years, and it never split or warped at all, with fairly regular use. The feature that drags it down is the shallow well surrounding the carving surface -- any amount of juice or drippings and it overflows. Something to watch for! Otherwise OK, but not for carving juicy meats."
2,Warped,"I've owned this product for two weeks. I moved and had my Boos block in storage; this was an interim solution. I realize that the board is not hard rock maple, but still ... Having washed it only in lukewarm soapy water three or four times, I am dismayed to notice signfcant warping (bowing, really) down the middle.Even at the price, I'm not happy with this product."
4,Great size,"My only gripe would be the thickness. If that dimension was in the description, I probably would not have bought this. I just use a towel underneath it to keep it from moving around."
3,Would be good without crack,"I got this as a gift for my mom. The board is a good size. You could carve a turkey on it, or roll out a pie crust. I like that it has a channel to catch liquids on one side, but the other side is smooth. It's dual purpose. Unfortunately one piece of the wood was flawed and it cracked the first time she used it. The rest of the board seemed solid and I'm sure it was just a fluke. I'm in the returns process and plan to reorder the same board. I'll post another review on that one, which I'm sure I can give top rating if there are no flaws in the wood."
1,Hopeless and Got tilted within 2 days,Useless product.Soaks water and becomes unbalanced and tilted withing 2 days..waste of money..
5,The Purification Plan,"I found this book to be very useful. It is an excellent book for anyone seeking information on common ailments and remedies utilizing a natural, homopathic approach."
5,The mystery...and the chasm...deepen,"This series just keeps getting better the deeper it goes. For me, Noir got off to a slow start with an assassination-of-the-week type of feel that was saved by the sheer atmosphere of the work...a blending of music, lush visuals, intriguing characters and mystery. The power of Noir is its masterful, minimal storytelling, where each spoken word counts for so much, and each of the main characters' reactions is allowed to linger long enough for the viewer to absorb it and truly feel it. There is a tenuous, understated bond between Kirika and Mirielle that's both sweet and sad. In this 5th DVD, we learn more about the ghosts that haunt our heroines. One driven by an obsessive need for revenge, the other for a desperate need for redemption, in this DVD the chasm between them widens. The final line uttered by Kirika at the end of the last episode on the disk is a heart-breaker."
5,The name of an ancient fate,"Kirika and Mirielle are assassins for hire. They'll rub out anyone for enough money. Kirika has anmesia. All she recalls is the skills she has as an assassin. A mafia organization has sanctioned them and sends hitmen to test their skills. What they don't know yet is that they are candidates to take the title of Noir, an ancient team of killers that is feared by the underworld.Noir is a very stylish anime. The colors and the soundtrack create a very unique mood. The series has a lot of action and plenty of mystery. It's a very cool series. The characters are compelling and keep you wanting to watch more. I definitely think anyone, anime fan or not, can get a lot of enjoyment out of it."
1,Not received,Can't review the item till we receive it. This is the tracking number 9102009591871213951164.
3,Smaller than I realized,Good for a small bedroom close by. Not so good for a larger living area. Seems to take longer to heat up room than previous heater I had but that heater was 2x the size so probably not fair to compare
4,A necessity in your library,Good quality for price and a book very rich in content. Captivating reeding taking its start all the way back to Queen Hatchepsut's journey to Punt 1482 B.C to 20:th century explorers.
5,"The Plant Hunters, by Tyler Whittle","My SF Botanical Garden book club is reading this book! It's out of print, but Amazon was able to provide several reliable sources for it. It's a superb read, not the dry digging you might expect, but a keen telling of the stories, the history of the times, and the passionate characters who found and nurtured the plants to be shared with other enthusiasts. We're reading it together with Glynis Ridley's ""The Discovery of Jeanne Baret."""
5,A great read!,All credit to Gary Courtney for a well-researched yet easy to understand book that offers a new insight into the true origin of Christianity. It deserves to be a winner!
1,Waste of time,"This is not a work of art. It's a great title and a good story could have been written for it but the viewer will wonder why it was made. The ""actors"" appeared to be bored and the antics over-done, and instead of an interesting movie, you have crap."
1,"Save your money, time, life, etc...",A horrific transfer to DVD. I trashed it after only watching 20 minutes or less.
5,The absolute BEST song Ever!!!,"I first heard this song on my computer radio. When the name came up (Angela Via - Picture Perfect) I thought ""oh, great, another Britney..."" but I was wrong! Angela Via is a great singer with a great voice who can Really Sing! When the song started, I almost skipped it, but I stopped myself after a few notes. I really liked it! So I turned the sound way up and listened. When it was over, I was dissappointed that it didn't last longer. So I made up my mind to buy the single, and I must say, I am not dissappointed with the single. It's soooo good. If you think Anglea is anything like Britney, think again. She's sooooooooooooooooo much better!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome Song,"If you like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and/or Mariah Carey, you will definately like this song ""picture perfect"". The 1st time I heard it I actually thought it was Christina or Britney. It's an upbeat song. I absolutely love it! Hmm...she(meaning angela) was just on Rosie the 3rd of April. I mean this will probably be a TRL #1 as soon as there is a video out. You HAVE TO BUY THIS CD! bye!"
5,vintage Dinah!,"I am very happy I bought this volume. While there are a few commercial clunkers, overall it is packed full of soulful Dinah. Definitely worth the price of admission."
3,My Review,This book gives general info on the types of weapons used by ninja. However for more in depth info I suggest that you look elswhere. This book is good if you are looking for the types of wepons used and not how to master use of them.
3,Book Cover,I bought this book thinking that because of the cover the Ninja had used weapons imported from China. Wrong! Both weapons on the cover are of Chinese origin but they are not mentioned in the book. There are weapons not found in other books on Japanese arms. That is why I rated this OK. Just do not be misled by the cover.
1,Junk! buy something else,These boots where destroyed within about 4-5 days of regular use. your probably better off buying a better quality product.
3,good for the size but.........,"This is a really good size in terms of portability, but the frankly, the battery sucks. Even if rechargeable, it dies out too quickly. Even though it is nice and portable, it also skips alot, at least from my experience. I gave it a 3 because of the portability, the CD Player Dream, if you will. I would get the SL-SX430 if you don't mind to give up a little portability. The SL-SX430 has an insane battery life but is a little bit bare bones but comes with a remote, which is always a plus."
1,Battery died,I had the same problem as another reviewer on this forum. The rechargeable battery died. I had barely used it. If you forget to unplug the CD from the power cord after recharging is complete you will fry the battery. I've never seen this behavior on any other rechargeable device. This is a serious design flaw by Panasonic. It's a shame that such a serious problem undermines what would otherwise be a great product.
4,Great Knife!,"This knife is great for slicing crusty breads! I was a little bit concerned because it is on the ""lower"" end of the Wustof knives but I really like it and use it almost every day."
5,Best knife I own,"Wusthof is a great brand and I own several, but this is my favorite. I recognize that it's a bread knife, but works great quartering large pieces of meat or veggies.Buying two more for Christmas presents."
5,Sun Shade,"This is a real lifesaver in the Texas sun. We have placed it over the pool area to provide some shade during peak hours. It is great, highly recommend to pool users."
4,coolaroo shade,"great value for the money. the wall brackets are no where near big enough for this size sail, we had to have some made, but overall a good value. 10 year warranty is great, we'll see how the hold up to the AZ sun..."
5,Better to order from Amazon than directly from the company!,"I made the mistake of ordering my first two Shade Sails directly from Coolaroo - BIG mistake. They came in a plain box with no paperwork and the company did not ever respond to two phone calls and two e-mails.On the other hand, not only was the price much better, this sail arrived in a box with complete instructions, inside and out! Important, since you want to make sure the connections are secure and you're using the correct screws, etc."
4,it's bigger than it sounds,"The kit was everything I needed to install the unit, except for the screw to go into my support structure. However, the directions indicate I needed an extra foot on all sides to take out the slack and for the hardware. Therefore, you need just under a 13 foot square area."
1,No Customer Service,This company doesn't respond to phone calls or email. It really doesn't have customer service even though it publishes an email address and a phone number for it.The instructions specify that a wood post should be at 20 deg and a metal post at 10 deg away from the shade without any dimensions or justification.
4,coolaroo,Love the way the Coolaroo shades and cools our pergola. It was easy to install and keeps the main part of the sitting area protected from sun and rain leaving parts open for plants and sun lovers.Great alternative to completely covering the screened in deck.
5,Shade Sail - Great quality!,"I have researched a number of shade sails for my pergola and was very impressed by the reviews and the quality of the Coolaroo Shade Screen. It is made by a company that is focused on providing a variety of items [i.e. clothing, shade sails in several different sizes, .. providing shade and comfortable, cool clothing]."
1,NOT square at all.,"It isn't square. The edges are curved inward. It's 11 1/2 feet wide at the corners but only 8 1/2 feet wide in the middle. It says square, I expect it to be square. A 12x12 shade is 144 square feet. They take off several inches on each edge for seams plus another couple for the attachment rings, then the sides curve so it's only 95 square feet of shade. Getting returned."
3,Problems with installation,"We have a 12' area to cover and thought the 11'10"" would be perfect, but you need about a foot on each side in order to hang these. We made it work - more or less - but are not sure how it will hold up as it is not taut. We could not use the included hardware. I wish Amazon's product description told you to buy 2 feet smaller than the area you need it for."
2,Hardware Missing !,This is a great product when they send the hardware. Last 2 I ordered was missing hardware. Going to Lowes next time.
2,Hanging it is a difficult process!!!,"While it looks good once it's up, it sags. We've made several attempts to make it as tight as can be without much help from the instructions, and are very disappointed in that aspect. If better instructions were given, we'd be giving this product 5 stars! But the directions are vague and do not help with information on how to hang it, no dimensions, no recommendations on pipe width, which hardware to use, etc.Now we are stuck with pipes cemented into our lawn at the incorrect distance and width and will have to remove them and purchase new pipes. Not happy.Also, do not expect this to protect your from the rain! Just a side note. It does great for shade, but nothing else."
3,"durable construction, but...looks like a swap meet tarp","The sail shade looks very durable and well made. The problem is I purchased the ""Ocean blue"", which close up looks great, but from 20 feet away it looks like those swap meet tarps you purchase at home depot. I put it up in my porch and it looked like I was having a garage sale or camping. It also takes a very strong metal pole on each corner to keep it tight. It looks terrible when it sags even a little."
4,Gimme shade,"We needed shade on our west facing deck after our gazebo blew away. We didn't want to spend a ton of cash, so this looked like a great idea. My husband had to put fence posts on the edge of our deck. It came out looking like the picture. It does shade the area nicely, but looks a little tarpy."
1,Same thing can be bought for much less!!!!,"The exact same thing goes for anything from 29.99 to 32.00. Why buy for this crazy price? I bought a 16' X 15"" for $39.99, and 2 other, with dleivery for $84.99! Same quality and material. Do your research."
2,Plastic Fountain,"I bought this fountain and it is cheap looking. You'll need to add rocks and bury the base so it doesn't have that plastic cheap bowl look. I've only had it 1 day so don't know how durable it is. Functionally, it is a good design and works well and is pretty with the lights off it has a soft lit appearance. I guess for $30. you get that."
2,Water Fountain,Fits perfectly in a small area. Need to keep an eye on the water level. It tends to go dry very quickly.
2,Will Cost $15 more than you bargained for,"The program will not update. I purchased it April 9, and sat down on the 14th (procrastination is a strong suit of mine)to do my taxes using the business edition. Whenever I tried to download the latest forms It kept freezing up. You cannot submit it until it is updated. I visited the web site, did everything it suggested. Spent an hour on the phone with ""tech"" support, who basically walked me through what the web site said. Then said well you will have to call customer service to get the update cd. Customer Service Charged me [$$$] to overnight it to me. I understand they have to recoup CD and Shipping costs, but just put it somewhere where I can download it and I would be happy. The personal solution is good, the business is poor. Don't buy it."
2,"Not Great, but will get you through back taxes","I purchased this product to file taxes for a prior year (business). The software was clumsy to use, not intuitive, and a bit hard to navigate. But I got through it. You may have to fill some forms manually, and if that is the case, the system offers very little instruction on whether you are doing it right. Still, I appreciated the final error checking and access to all the 2002 forms I would possibly use. The 2002 version is not great software, but it sure beats doing it by hand."
1,Don't use it,"I give it 0 stars. We used it for a small business and it was a pain in the neck. It wasn't easy to use like TurboTax. One example: Our business didn't require one of their forms to be filled out...because of that form being blank, it wouldn't let us continue. Therefore, we ended up printing out what we had, filled it out by hand and then we got our money back. Oh, and the local H&R Block was not willing to help us even though their product wasn't working right. Next year, we use Turbo Tax."
2,Not very good,"I bought Tax Cut Platinum Business version. The help system is really lousy. Very skimpy. The interface is not intuitive. And worst of all, fter spending 20 minutes figuring it out and filling in the information (without much help), the software failed with a ""runtime error"" message.I assumed it was some sort of fluke, so I rebooted and tried it again. About 25 minutes into typing my information, I got another ""runtime error"" message and my computer froze up. I then went out and bought Turbo Tax Business Edition; I cost more, but it was very nice. The interface is very intuitive, help screens are more helpful, and best of all it works."
2,Could be much better...,"Indigenous Peoples and the Future of Amazonia is an anthology which boasts contributions from archaeologists, anthropologists, cultural ecologists and nutritionists, its input from the indigenous population is limited to a two-page forward by Simeon Jimenez and Nelly Arvelo-Jimenez.Sponsel mentions that an earnest attempt was made to include authors from the nine Amazonian countries. However, in the end, only three of the authors are from South America.Perhaps I'd hoped for a more activist approach, or at least, a ground-based examination of current environmental practices and potential strategies. Instead, this is a scholarly book which sticks its nose in the pages of future academic research and does not appear to be looking up. The book provides no action plan and few resources or contacts for interested readers.Still, in its own way, this is an interesting volume and offers more than a handful of insightful gems."
2,Should have been named Funny Moments in Tennis,This video will put a smile on your face if you love tennis but even at 16.99 this is a very expensive 40 minutes.
3,"Captures the mental state of Eagles fans, but is far too lengthy","I am a Eagles fan through and through. I read this book and I understood the meaning of it. I've been there, felt the hardship, the failure so I could relate to this book. However, the basic message of this book could have been written in much fewer pages. The last hundred pages seemed to drag on and relay the same message over and over."
4,"A book reflecting ""A Take On Philly's Line Of Thought""","11/28/09 Although the book does not give any text book worthy knowlege to be absorbed on Philly's demograpy and geography and leans a little toward ""honorable mention of faith based religions"" in the city founded by the Quaker William Penn, it is more than just a hit and miss on various subjects(even a little about Philly politics)..It moves smoothly from... a. its intro to ... b. its calendar days of December 17,2004 (Chapter 1) to February 6,2005(Chapter 29) ... c. along with an ""epilogue"" . Although its major contents is ""football"", no sport**, no matter how sparce the mention of it**, is overlooked in the book as a reminder of the caption* under the book's title (""If Football's a Religion ,Why Don't We Have A Prayer"" by Jere Longman ) of *Philadelphia,Its Faithful and the Eternal Quest for Sports Salvation""*. 11/28/09 abj"
4,For beginners,"Jazz compilation without the best (Django Reinhardt) and the most influential (Charlie Christian)?Naturally, Verve is doing the best it can with its rich vaults, and the number of great guitar players is really impressive (Hall, Burrell, Montgomery, Pass, Kessell, McLaughlin...); some of them are probably represented with their choisiest work...So, all in all, this is very good for jazz beginners who'd have a hard time comprehending Django's music anyway..."
3,"Good background info, not to be used as a travel guide","This book is good for everyone who want a torough understanding of the history and today of New Orleans. Alas, we bought it as a travel guide, but its practical part is just to small to be useful."
2,Not worth it,"The backgrond information was interesting, however it did not make up for the mistakes in the restaurant section, etc. I found the book confusing and inaccurate on a number of occaisions. The book also lists only a smattering of hotels and restaurants which was very frustrating. For example, the book states that Gabrielle's Restaurant is on the ""edge of the French Quarter"" which could be further from the truth. The restaurant is far past Rampart St., which is the edge of the French Quarter. The bok also lists the St. Louis Cemetaries No. 1 & 2 in the Garden District. This also could be farther from the truth. Save your ... for a book on N.O. with accurate info."
2,Not enough on its own,"We just got back from 5 days in New Orleans, and this was the only guide we took with us. It was a mistake. It's a difficult book to navigate, has limited maps, limited selection of accomodation & restaurants. If you go outside of Madi Gras & with children (two teenagers in our case) half the book is irrelevent. The restaurant '100 best' list doesn't match Zagats (always reliable). It warns against solo visits to the cemeteries (they're not safe, go on a tour), but doesn't explain why! Pity there isn't a Michelin Green Guide."
4,Great Book for Decorating Ideas!,"I love New Orleans and everything about it! My husband and I go there regularly, so when we bought a new house in December, I wanted to really decorate the interior of some of the rooms ""New Orleans Style"". When searching on Amazon, I found this book with pictures of some homes in NOLA interiors. I found this book to be very helpful as far as decorating and choosing Nawlins' colors for my house. Not to mention the fact that it gives me a ""quick fix"" for New Orleans when I can't be there in person!"
5,Wicked! Wicked!,Wicked wicked! This is a fab book and worth every cent. Makes me want to explore New Orleans.The houses'interior and exterior photos were beautifully shot. Photos of the old furniture and antebellum style were just superb. For those who love history and period interiors/antiques this book will enthrall.
5,BEST,"amazing novel full of betrayal,murder and romance.you will become absorbed in this story to the last page."
3,It's OK but thick,"Product is nice but I find like most Vanity fair items, it is thick. You will get very warm wearing this under a dress, unless it's winter and that's what you want. Definitely not for summer use."
5,Wonderful simple layer.,"This is so smooth, I have actually used it as a nightgown. It is a great layer under a dress or skirt and so comfortable because there is no annoying elastic anywhere.It's cut pretty narrow, and if you're a bit heavy might not be for you."
1,Spinslip Spins,"I read the reviews and ignored them, thinking that the problem with the slip turning around would not affect me. Wrong. If this slip would stay put it would be PERFECT. I probably won't ever wear it again. It looks a little odd when people can see the armhole of the slip in the middle of your chest. No, you can't just give it a tug and get it back into place. You practically have to completely undress and turn it back around. Unless you want to velcro the thing in place save your money."
2,I loved it until I wore it.,"I was extremely pleased with the quality, feel, craftsmanship and look of this slip. I planned to order more but then I wore it. Other reviewers said this garment twisted on you. It does, so much so that every 30 minutes to an hour, I had to reorient the slip so half of it wouldn't be showing out of the top of my dress. I would have returned, but the shipping to and from would add insult to injury. Another garment that will go in the back of the closet. :("
1,Horrible,This vanity fair slip slides so much that it created a bulk under my dress and i couldn't fit it . I tried to fix it in various bathrooms from BK at work and it kept sliding up. how embarrassing I remember walking and people doing double takes and i knew it was time to try to bring it down . It was such a nightmare ..
2,Size misrepresented; Product quality is fine,"This is decently made but it is NOT ""full"" as described and the picture does NOT match the actual product. Gross misrepresentation by the seller in my opinion in both text and visual descriptions."
4,slip,Slip ! great comfy but would love a maxi length not long enough only problem . washes well great fabric .
1,Did Not Receive What Is In The Picture,"The slip pictured here is a full slip, mid calf The slip I received is just a bit longer than a camiWhat happenedWhat is in this picture is not what I received"
1,Be Warned --- They Run Very Large,"The size is not exact on these. They probably run about 4"" larger in the bust than the sizing indicates."
2,Not as expected,"Although this slip was silky to the touch and comfortable to wear, it was entirely too large for me. I bought the smallest size 34/18 (thinking the 34 correlated with bust measurement), but when I tried it on it was so big I felt like a little girl wearing her mom's clothing. If it had fit as well as the advertised photo shows, it would have been a keeper!"
5,A Magnificent Christmas Story,"This is a powerful, beautifully written novel, set in Brooklyn's Irish neighborhood during the time of JFK's assassination. Denis Hamill captures this tragic time with chilling accuracy. He has a great gift for bringing his characters to life, and he is a wonderful storyteller. The plot unfolds with some very compelling twists! I couldn't put it down.I told several of my friends about this book, and they loved it, too. I recommend it very highly!!"
3,Gift for former MN residents,This book was purchased as a gift for friends who have moved to a different state. They expressed gratitude but didn't recognize the pictures and locations. They seem happy enough with the book and like having a MN memento in their new home; the cover photo is fabulous!
2,Not his best,"This is one of the worst of Merritt's books, though Black Wheel wasn't his fault--it was completed after his death. Although Metal Monster has some interesting ideas, Merritt failed to bring any of them to life."
3,ok but I would like more...,"This is an ok item, i really expected it to be easier to use, however it does the job ok I just wanted a bit more...price was right though."
4,Very nice first handheld GPS,"I love this GPS. It's light and the buttons are clearly defined. The accuracy is great, although it's hard to get acquisition while moving, I suppose that's the same with all GPSrs. I've gone Geocaching already with it and it finds everything. I've once even got the accuracy within 3 feet, which was really nice. The only one con I can think of is that it is really slippery. I've almost dropped it twice, but was saved by the included wrist strap. Haven't gotten to test the water resistability, but I don't think I want to ""test"" it."
2,What you pay for is what you get,Pretty basic black and white unit; screen is hard to see in bright light situations. I'm going to sell it and upgrade.
2,Buy a Garmin,"I also bought this iFINDER GO2 piece of crap. No wheres near as accurate as my Garmin. The Garmin doesn't even use WAAS technology, and it beats the crap out of this lowrance crap.Garmin the way to go.Where the hells lowrance based out of anyway....some 5th world country??"
3,"Action good, not so good when actual speaking takes place","This movie comes at me a few different ways: When the action is happening, its a really good movie. When 'characters' (and I use the term loosely) are speaking, they utter some of the stiffest, most painful dialogue ever committed to celluloid. The little segments with the echoing 'whisper' are the worst; what was the point of the voice effect? 1980 movies don't have high-quality sountracks anyway, and this only serves to make it barely intelligible at times. There's many characters and plot threads brought up and dropped almost at random, and the acting is mediocre at best.The only time it shines is the well-done martial arts sequences (many done with a minimum of cutting), which almost make it worth suffering through. The ending fight in particular is very nice, almost balletic in spots. A shame they couldn't have hired a screenwriter without a tin ear and possessing a sense of pace and structure."
3,NASTY NINJAS,"A typical Chuck Norris vehicle that relies on its karate scenes to salvage it. Norris in an early role demonstrates his limited acting range, but makes up for it with some effective fight scenes. While the plot is convoluted and never makes total sense, it takes the back seat to Norris' attempts to get revenge on his ""brother"" who has gone bad. The supporting cast goes from mediocre (Art Hindle, Lee van Cleef, Carol Bagdasarian) to worse (Karen Carlson, Larry D. Mann, Kurt Grayson). There are annoying narrative voice overs of Norris' conscience that are more annoying with the use of some kind of reverberatory effect. THE OCTAGON is not the best of the Norris library, but you could do worse."
4,An Action Film Before its Time,"People scoff these days because Chuck Norris had a ridiculous 70's mustache. But keep in mind The Octagon was the film that introduced the Ninja to the American public. This was before James Clavelle's Shogun, this was before all the American Ninja movies, Franco Nero (who?) and all that. If it wasn't for this movie, little kids' ninja dolls would have come a little or a lot later.When I first saw this movie when I was a kid, the Ninja-thing took me by storm. Now that I've recently purchased the re-release DVD, the film still holds up not only as an action flick, but also as a document to a very exciting time in martial arts movies.Also keep in mind that American Cinema was at the time a cutting-edge independent movie company that set the standard for releasing and marketing niche movies. But you can see all that in the ""How American Cinema Changed Hollywood"" documentary in the special features."
3,"""What is your real name?"" Norris answers ""Do you really need to know?"" The man says ""No""","You have to love b movies. Now I have to be honest this flick does not deserve a full 3 stars. It is more like a 2 and a half but chuck norris's super sweet moves definitely gives it the full 3. So if you can stick with this thing just dragging along for 5-10 minutes at a time, you will be pleased with the last 30 minutes or so. Can Norris storm this evil ninja camp and save his friend? Can he kill his ninja brother. You will just have to watch and find out.The piture quality is good but not perfect by any means. The special featuresd are very interesting too giving you a behind teh scens of teh movie and a ton of info on the film company that made this movie and other good Chuck Norris flicks."
4,one of Chuck's best...,"...at least as far as the fighting is concerned. If you want a Chuck Norris movie with a good story/plot I'd go for Missing in Action I or II. Or maybe Forced Vengence. But as far as fight scenes, I have to give this one the edge. He displays a much better range of techniques in this movie as well as use of weapons than in any other movie I can remember.The acting is so-so. Better than usual I would say. the plot really isn't that compicated. And watching him fight opposite Tadeshi Yamashida is one of those rare moments of capturing two martial arts legends on film. Admittedly the movie has a slow build up, but overall it's a good movie if you like martial arts movies of that genre and era."
4,Great Old Time Flick,The Octagon is a classic with one of Australia's finest Martale arts.In my ways it show the world how The Ninja were trained and how one man can make a differense in this world if he wished to.
5,GREAT ACTION MOVIE,THIS MOVIE IS FUN TO WATCH BECAUSE THE FIGHT SCENES LOOK REAL. SOME PEOPLE WILL NOT LIKE THE VOICE OVER BUT I DID. THIS IS ONE OF ME FAVORTIVE MOVIES OF ALL TIME. FINALLY ON DVD TO BAD THERE IS NO DELETED SCENES. OVER WISE A GREAT MOVIE.
5,A Love for Cats,"If you love cats, you will love this book. This photo essay is a beautiful collection of kittens. Not only is it cute, but the photography is truly a work of art."
5,"If you love cats, these books are for you","I recommend all of Hans Silvester's books of cat photography. You get lots of photos and relatively little text, so they are perfect for those of us who just want to look at interesting, artistic photos of cats. Plus you get a glimpse of life in the Greek islands, so you can pretend you are enriching your mind while you ooh and aah at the images of furry felines. And if you read the text, you actually will learn about the cats and the people who share the islands with them."
5,WOOKIT DEM,"A better title for this book would be ""Many nice images of felines in a picturesque european coastal town created by exposing thin sheets of chemical-covered paper to light"".Mostly cats, not that many true kittens in here, but still well-worth your thin, rectangular, monochromatic paper-cloth images of our past leaders."
4,Newer issue of prior book,"This is the same text asMahamudra Teachings of the Supreme Siddhas. Per my prior review of that text: ""The root text is beautiful and, if one has had prior Mahamudra teachings, very concise and to the point. The commentary is generally vague and the supporting quotations less than enlightening--frequently more of an apologetic than a commentary. It does, occasionally, elucidate a valuable and interesting point--usually not covered in the root text. Somewhat disappointing overall. Unfortunately, I read the review after having read the book."""
1,Broke first time,My wife is a size 8 and this piece of junk broke the first time she put it on. She never even made it to the bed.
1,Don't waste your money,"After having horrible installation problems with NSW2001 last year, I decided to give Norton the benefit of the doubt. Maybe I actually got a bad disk both times I purchased the software (I had to return the first one). But after facing the same installation problems with a newly purchased NSW2002, I have decided No More Norton. I have gone to the extremes of a clean boot in 98se, as well as installation component by component, and still can't get it to install. The support at Symantac is non-existent. There is no reason that I can't put the disk in the drive and have this software install nicely. I refuse to pay this kind of money to have these kinds of problems."
3,Symantec strikes again!,"Great overall product but be prepared to start updating the program, the virus definitions and even the update program itself during the install. I bought it as soon as it was available and already there were fixes out for it.The ""extra"" included programs are not worth upgrading from Systemworks to Pro."
2,Any better than 2001 version?,"This software tried to uninstall SystemWorks 2001 and basically corrupted my Windows 2000. I had to reinstall the OS and then SW2002 installed fine. However, I am kind of disappointed at Norton's Win 2000 support. Seems half of the features in Norton Utilities are unavailable. Kind of sad, since lesser known Ontrack SystemSuite has much better support for Win 2000. Also, I don't see much of an improvement over SW2001."
1,SystemWorks is a SystemNoWork,"I in stalled Systemworks 2002 Pro on my computer running ME. After installing the software I started getting messages that I do not have enough memory. I have 640megs of RAM. It began to say that my registry was corruted. I allowed it to repair the registry. The machine crashed and I lost everything. SystemWorks is suppose to keep your system working. Instead, it prevented it from working. I do not recommend this product to anyone. If you do not have problems before installing it ( I had no problems before installing)you will when you do install."
2,Nikola Sarcevic - Lock-Sport-Krock,"It is undeniable that there is an alluring element to any release advertised as a front man's (of an entertaining band, such as Millencolin) acoustic side project. Nevertheless, based on the contrived and banal nature of ""Lock-Sport-Krock"" Nikola Sarcevic planned to cash in on the marketability of the name he's created for himself through his successful Swedish Punk Rock outfit. Mr. Sarcevic seems to have forgotten one thing; copying lines from his diary he kept as a middle schooler and passing them off as lyrics is not going to earn him any dignity among the critics. Noteworthy: ""Lovetrap.""2/5"
2,Book arrived damaged,The book is great. I ordered it for a baby shower and didn't have time to return it when it arrived with a damaged corner. Very disappointing. I needed to know the condition before I ordered it.
4,Teddy Bear Picnic,Pictures are wonderful. Just wish the book was in hard cover. Do not recommend it in soft. The pages seemed to get marked up very easily. The book is a good size so if you are reading it to a class you can see the pictures easily. It is a lovely book.
2,What was I thinking?,"I read all of Terry Brooks books as a kid and thought I'd re-read a bunch of them for fun. Picked up most of the books at a used book store on a whim.While I liked ""Magical Kingdom For Sale"", this one was just based on the dumbest premise of all. Seriously, the entire premise of this book is stupid. The King has one magical amulet that is the most important thing in the world and he gives it away by page 30. The rest of the book is just listening to the stupid antics of him trying to get it back. Blah, blah and blah. I just couldn't get past the main plot thread."
4,Third in the series continues the quality of the first two,Mr Brooks saga of Landover is strong and the struggles people face is worked out in the fantasy world. Not quite as strong as the first two but it provides a good read
3,"A four star story, but loses a star for disabling txt to speech","I'm enjoying the Landover series, but the quality of the digitization hasn't been great. Still, the stories are definitely worth 4 stars. However, because the publisher has chosen to disable text to speech, the kindle book immediately loses significant value to me.Amazon should never have backed down on this feature. :("
4,"Fairies, Dragons, Witch's.....",I needed this book along with another to complete the series. Have read several times. Now going to next series.
3,"Good Book, But Terry Brook's Worst one Ever.","I've read all but three of Terry's book, I haven't read HOOK, RUNNING WITH THE DEMON, or A KNIGHT OF THE WORLD, and let me tell you, this was his worse book by far. Don't get me wrong, it was an alright book, and a necissity for the landover series, I just didn't enjoy it as much as the other. This book seemed like it moved real slow, and at parts I had to force my self to keep reading it, but if you like Terry Brooks and his landover novels, this is a must read book."
3,Wizard at Large,"Ben Holiday is settling in quite nicely in Landover. All seems to be going as he planned, more or less. Nothing, however, stays that way when the wizard Questor Thews is around. Although Questor always has the best of intentions, his grasp of his magic leaves much to be desired.Thinking he has finally mastered the magic to turn Abernathy, the king's court scribe, back from dog to human, Questor attempts this feat and fails miserably. Not only did he not change Abernathy back, now Abernathy is missing, along with the king's medallion. In his place is a mysterious bottle. A quite dangerous bottle.This series keeps getting better for me. Each book outdoing the previous. I dont see a lot of growth in the characters, but the stories are entertaining and keep me coming back."
3,Author tries to be too funny,"I thought the book was too complicated for beginners and too easy for novices. The author tries to be way too funny and sometimes it's hard to determine if he's kidding or not. Some pretty good tidbits though, and was easy reading."
5,PCs for Dummies,"There are several PCs for Dummies books but I believe this one is likely the best. I've used computers for over 20 years and find this book gives all the tips, tricks and shortcuts that I may have never been aware of or fogotten. It's a great refresher and reference source no matter how basic or advanced the computer user is."
5,A satisfied customer,"This publication gives me a good understanding of the basics of using my PC, in words that were very easy to understand."
1,"Short on ""How ""To""","It does well on explaining most of the subjects. This is great for some of us ""Dummies"", but does little of how to do it."
4,Keeping it simple is ok but PLEASE not simple-minded.,"Formatting starts on page 113, not 114.No explanation of fragmenting and defragging.GOTCHA!"
4,I LIKED THIS BOOK,"VERY HELPFUL FOR THE NOVICE COMPUTER NUT. IT'S READABLE FROM PAGE 1 TO THE END, BUT ALSO, EASY TO LOOK UP STUFF USING CHAPTER HEADINGS OR THE INDEX. LIKE ALL 'DUMMIES' BOOKS, HUMOR IS THERE FOR THE ASKING. I RECOMMEND IT."
4,Very Good,This is a very handy book to have. It is best for people who have very little experience with computers.
5,The New Sony CD Walkmen RULE!,"I just have to post words of love about this product - I got one 2 weeks ago, and it is AWESOME. It's really hard to get it to skip WITHOUT the anti-skip protection being on, the design is brilliantly thought out (example: automatic resume on all CDs so it goes back to the track you stopped it at, UNLESS you open the lid - it ""knows"" you've opened it and it'll start again at the beginning), I mean, this is one of the best products I own besides my Swiss Army Knife. One noticeable downside is that it doesn't have an independent line-out, so you'll just have to set the volume at your favorite level for routing it through an amplifier. However, that's about the only nit I've found to pick about this CD player. Oh yeah, just one more thing: TWENTY-HOUR BATTERY LIFE!"
5,It's little and never skips!!,"I had an Emerson Research portable CD player and it only had 25 second skip free. This one will never skip. It has a remote so when you are riding on your bycicle you don't have to stop your bike, get off, and then push in the song you like. It also has a ""hold"" switch that allows you not to hit buttons by mistake..... The no-skip feature is great for when you are on the lawn-moer. This is one of the best portable CD players to buy right now. I would always recomend this."
5,Beautiful and As Pictured/Described,"~BACKGROUND~I purchased this piece as a gift for my wife.~PROS~- Synthetic cut gems means no blemishes or flaws - who really knows or cares whether the gems are natural or real? Natural costs way too much!- Appears to made well with no flaws or irregularities.- Necklace comes packaged well. It is in a small velvet-like pouch and a box.- Size description is accurate at 0.75 inches.~CONS~- None so far!~CONCLUSION~My wife really likes the earrings and I feel it is a good value for the price.This is the third item I have purchased from Eve's Addiction and have been very satisfied with their shipping, packaging and products."
2,Convenient but annoying,"The overall size is convenient. The sound quality is ok for the price. The clips hold the buds on your ear, but I found it very difficult to position the clips so the buds stay in the ear. For some reason the clips do not want to stay flat against my head and annoyingly flip outward like little wings."
1,"Garbage, spend you cash elsewhere.","Uncomfortable, and sound horrible with poos build quality, and poor customer service to boot. I recieved these as a gift, and would not recomend them to anyone. Unless you don't like the person you are giving them to....."
2,"Tinney sound - otherwise comfotable, but not acceptable","The headphones have nice design features, excellent base pick up and excellent other stats. However it fails in actual sound quality - the sound is tinney and simply sounds cheap. While it registers base nicely, its treble is way off (on the loud end) which irritated me. I bought them to replace some headphones that are getting rattly - but I like my old ones lots better.If you don't care about the tinney sound, it would be an excllent pair, good style, comfortable, and nice cord retract feature. However my advice is still to get a different pair unless you're deaf to frequencies above 15kH."
4,How To Be Fab!,"Let the Beatles ""Help!"" you to be Fab! That's the premise of this interesting and well-written book. One of my favorite spiritiual teachers (Marianne Williamson) wrote a blurb for the cover - calling it ""wise and entertaining."" Very true!""The Beatles Way"" is also well researched, and contains tons of facts I didn't know about the Beatles. Good, solid self-help book - easy to read - easy to stick to."
2,Not Very Complex,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I didn't really want a new age self-help book for how to get along with your co-workers and family. The Beatles meant bigger things to me about lifestyle and idealism--bigger and more complex than this book which even has a section about the importance of choosing good names for your ideas and products or whatever...it's okay--but it's not quite the depth I was looking for. I'd check out Derek Taylor'sIt Was Twenty Years Ago Today, for a better taste of Beatle's philosophy."
1,"""using"" the Beatles for his own fatuous nonsense","To attempt to reduce the genius of the Beatles to this new age, ""live your dreams,"" sophmoric pablum is to demonstrate that you didn't ""get"" the Beatles at all. Think a bit on the John Lennon song, ""God,"" written as the Beatles were breaking up. Even the Beatles -- who shared a love and inspiration most of us will never know -- could not hold it together. Like several other avatars through history, they gave those who were there an experience of the eternal and then shattered from the pressure of the demands made upon them. The thick apostles then ruin it. All they could leave us is the music -- lyrics and melody together than synergistically capture a certain energy -- but it's only a small taste of what they offered and what they meant. Mr. Lange's presentation demeans that experience -- he took his preconceived self-help template and squeezed Beatles lyrics and quotations into it. This book amounts to just yellow matter custard."
2,Unreliable and scary,"Being ... off by Intuit's new ""protection"" system, I decided to try TaxCut this year... Well, now I have a second thought. I ran into so many bugs and inconsistencies in the TaxCut that I am simply scared to submit to the IRS the returns forms generated by it. Examples: 1)It drags a mistake in my address intput from screen to screen even after I corrected it in the address input form. 2) I had to use Google to find the latest update on the H&R;' website. 3) It bugged me with request to input the SSN for my ""second child"" (while I indicated that I have only one). And so on and so forth..And it still inferior to the TurboTax in terms of functionality and UI convenience. Sometime it seems that this program has been written by the same seasonally hired ""tax preparers"" who are ""working"" in the H&R;'s walk-in offices."
2,Not Reliable or Helpful at all,"I, like others before me, bought this software for the first time due to the bad reviews turbotax was getting over it's registration process. In working on my girlfriends taxes today, I have two major complaints. The most severe being the lack of informative help. I remember turbotax providing so much more help whenever there was a term I didn't understand. This software only includes the IRS instructions and many links to call a tax advisor for explanations. The second problem is the user interface. It was NOT TESTED. There were screens in which the text wasn't completely clear (covered by other text and not scrollable). This is completely unacceptable and I will be buying Turbotax to redo my girlfriends taxes and begin mine. I honestly do not feel that this software was properly tested and wouldn't trust the tax return it spits out."
3,Disappointing; about as good as TurboTax was 2-3 years ago,"I switched to TaxCut from TurboTax because reviews said it was as good as TurboTax but without TurboTax's copy protection scheme. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Entering Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) transactions was much more difficult than last year's TurboTax. The capital gains wizard was almost no help. The online instructions and help were much less helpful, and the help had a much poorer index.Overall, I would say TaxCut 2003 is about as good as TurboTax was 2-3 years ago. But it is not nearly as easy to use as TurboTax was last year. As much as I dislike TurboTax's copy protection scheme, I will go back to TurboTax next year."
1,A total waste of Time,"I too turned to TaxCut in order to get away from TurboTax and Intuit. Unfortunately, I've so far spent two hours trying to convince the software that I do NOT owe $$$ in ATM (an apparent problem with their worksheet). The software also missed the Capital Loss carry over. A little poking around and I discovered that I was required to enter last year's data in order for it to know this. Guess they could have included that in the ""interview"" . It also turns out they they have made no provisions for self employed health insurance deductions. They have the worksheet, it's just not tied into the 1040 form. And once you make an override to any form, TaxCut will not allow you to E-File your return to the IRS. In summary, no I won't go back to Turbo Tax, I'll just do my taxes the old fashioned way, by hand. A lot faster and A LOT LESS FRUSTRATION!"
1,Don't buy it!,"I just bought Taxcut Platinum for Mac and it doesn't work!! Completely buggy interface. Shuts off and takes me back to the desktop screen. Lost data three times before I gave up. I read the other reviews from this year and am wondering if they are legitimate as I also (too late) just read the reviews on this site for Taxcut 2001 which indicate problems similar to mine. I don't even want to give this product one star but that's the lowest option. Also, 20 minutes on the long distance charge help line with no answer and no answer from the e-mail tech people. Caveat emptor!!! Class action suit anyone???"
2,extra download for update,I purchased TaxCut instead of TurboTax because TurboTax required initialization over the internet to use it. My daughter and I both use the program and TaxCut allows up to 5 family members usage. I DID NOT like the fact that I had to download updates to both this and the State program that took almost an hour to do. Also the State program did not recognize that Harford County has only three incorporated towns and gave me an error message to list my town. I thought it should have been aware of all local information.
1,Simply a cheap toy.,"I got what I paid for - a cheap toy. Yes, it does respond to movement, but at a range of about three feet. Once someone is within three feet the ""toy"" is simply to be laughed at. I sent one to my son in the Military as a desk toy. He said that it was too ""stupid"" to display even for a laugh."
3,jesi's thoughts,"Of course Maddie enters a web-site contest, but that doesn't mean that her whole life has to turn into a horror story? Right? Of course it does, when the three BFFs get caught up in an old ghost story they realize how chicken they really are. Madison and I want to turn Ivy into a chicken to, since she's being so mean and bossing every single one of Madison's great ideas about decorating the Halloween dance to the ground. Who died and made her most annoying slug in the universe?"
5,Marvelous Story,"I thought that this book was great. It had a great Halloween theme. I thought it had a great plot. I think that this was a great Halloween book without having any real ghost or haunted houses(except for the dace, but that wasn't real). It had a great plot and I really I enjoyed it. I couldn't put it down. I read all of it in 2 hours!"
4,Good for low exercise,"We use a single shoe for my great dane. He has a foot injury that requires him to wear protective covering so that he doesn't chew his healing skin. If you use this for a short bursts the shoes are great. However, if you are walking daily on them you will see them start to tear at the seams. I do like that they cover most of my dogs lower leg and all of his foot for trekking through the snow. They keep his foot dry and that is what we need to help him heal and to keep him from gnawing the wound."
1,DOG BOOTS - Summer or Winter Protection - X-LARGE DOG BOOTS - Summer or Winter Protection - X-LARGE,"Unless your dog has no claws, expect for the ends to tear. Also the plastic bracket used to tighten the boots broke. I really was hoping that these boots would last but sadly they didn't. Within two weeks of having the boots they began to tear and the Velcro started to fray."
2,Not the best,"I used to think tack was very great for keeping up posters at school. I tried to use this tack to hang up the posters in my room and not only did it mark up my posters, the tack kept falling off and was difficult to spread. Granted, the room was very humid. I only used one strip and threw the rest away."
3,Not strong enough for christmas lights,"I was looking for an easy way to put up Christmas lights on the interior side of my windows. ""Blustik"" poster tack/adhesive putty was suggested by a number of people. Unfortunately, I couldn't find blu-tak at the store, and the Elmer's tack looked equivalent. I bought it thinking there couldn't be a huge difference in brands of poster tack. So wrong. It wont hold the wires to the painted wood or to the glass window. I only had to try for a couple minutes before it became obvious that the Elmer's tack would not be strong enough for my needs.I gave it three stars because I'm sure it could be used for its intended application: holding posters up. Don't plan on putting up anything heavier than a piece of paper, though. Also, its hardly sticky, so it's not going to leave residue on your walls."
1,This stuff did not work very well.,"I bought this for my daughter to use in her dorm room. It did not hold her posters on the wall at all. Might be ok for smaller things, like photos."
2,didn't stick but the walls are very shiny,"Trying to stick regular paper posters to the walls of my classroom. the walls are both textured and shiny with oil-based paint, and this didn't work AT ALL."
1,Aweful Poster Tack - get the white stuff!,"More like gooey, melter silly putty than the normal poster tack. A total mess to try and peel off and leaves an oil residue on non laminated papers. Yuck!"
2,Not that great,"This is not the greatest poster tack available. It requires a great amount of kneading before it sticks well, and it isn't that strong. It will hold posters up fine enough, but anything more (eg a calendar) would fall off very quickly. The best that I have found is Bostik's Blu-Tak. It is available on Amazon. It is far superior to any other poster tak I have tried, and I have tried at least 4 different brands."
2,most posters have fallen,Bought this to hang up my kids posters. I hung up 5 posters and 2 remain on the wall. The fallen ones fell within a day but the ones the are still up seem to be holding up well. I would recommend using at minium an entire tack bar for a poster and don't rely on them being reusable.
1,Leaves a residue if you can even get it to stick at all...,"It takes a large amount of kneading to get it to stick in the first place, and when you finally get it up it leaves spots on your wall that can only be painted over. The slightest temperature change makes it lose its adhesiveness, too, causing your posters to constantly fall, occasionally taking a chip of paint with it. All in all, a disappointing product."
2,doesn't hold,"I bought this after reading the reviews because I thought that it would hold the super thin, light-weight paper that I was trying to tack up....wrong. I just wanted it to for a short time, hold up my son's never ending rotation of art work. It failed, they keep falling down."
2,"Looks kind of cute, not for comfort at all","I wanted an inexpensive shoe to alternate with just tennis shoes for casual wear. My boyfriend has some adidas and said they were nice.I suppose it is just this model of shoe, but they are very VERY rigid....even the shoe tongue is awfully hard. It feels like it's stabbing the top of my foot when I try to wear them. They are also highly INflexible....my boyfriend says that they would probably be ok if I tried to break them in, but the discomfort is so great that I wouldn't want to try.I have them around still, but they never make it out of the closet anymore. Adidas makes other comfortable shoes, so I guess it's just this particular one is a dud. Comfort is a huge deal to me, so I just can't deal with these."
2,"Okay, but not what I expected",Many of the renditions of traditional Christmas songs were hardly recognizable. I liked maybe two of the songs on the albums. I would not recommend this CD.
1,Worthless peice of junk,I purchased this thermos for my over the road truck driver husband. It worked for about a month. Now it will not keep anything hot for longer than 3 hours! I wasted my money!
1,Tepid coffee,"I've tried every tip in the book with this vacuum bottle. My coffee will NOT stay hot. After a short drive to work, it's only warm. Outside of bottle feels warm, so heat is escaping. This is the second Stanley I've had and I am really not happy with Stanley products. Am I just unlucky enough to get TWO bad bottles? Stupid me for deciding to give it another try. I'm taking it back to the store.Why does everyone else have piping hot coffee with these things? I'd give it NO stars if I could.Argh."
1,Not so HOT!,"Receive the Stanley Bolt Vacuum Bottle on a Wednesday and by Friday the lid was out of shape and leaking. Only keep coffee hot for about 6 hours. Two weeks late bought a Thermos Brand form Walmart, happy with this one."
1,You can't be serious.,"Before I made my purchase, I read the reviews for the Stanley bottle I wanted. There were good reviews buzzing about and there were bad reviews loitering around. The ratio of good reviews to bad ones was about 6:1. Which, with to my standards, helped uplift my consumer confidence. So i clicked and it came on the following Monday.Not to be someone who throws bad reviews around to conjure misery, but some things must be said:The good1. The mighty bolt will hold 1.1 quarts of coffee.2. It looks cool, I guess.The bad1. The temperature of your coffee will diminish in mere hours. Say you store a cup of 200 degree Fahrenheit coffee. In about an two hours, it will be half that at best.2. It's big and bulky-- not recommended for people who already have big items in their bag.For those of you who enjoy lukewarm to cold coffee. Go ahead, get it."
1,Worthless piece of dog do do!,"We recently purchased this Stanley Aladin Overtime Vacuum 1.1 Quart Bottle as our old thermos had given up the ghost after falling out of the car one time too many. The reason for purchase of a thermos is to keep things like coffee hot. Unfortunately, this thermos fails abjectly at that task and within an hour or so the coffee is dead cold. My wife even puts very hot water inside the thermos for ten minutes before filling it with hot freshly brewed coffee. I think if you left the coffee out it would not cool any faster than it does in this thermos. What a ripoff!"
1,Not HOT!,"I purchased this thermos for Father;s Day. It was great for 5 weeks. Coffee was hot for 15+ hours. Then one night it was cold in about 3 hours. Same cleaning/drying process each time. Rinsed out by hand only. Try finding a Stanley customer service number is a joke too. Don't waste the money, rather go to Donin Donuts."
1,This thermos stinks,This thermos stinks. It will not keep anything WARM for more than 5 hours. Very disappointed with this product. Going back to the20 year old standard stanley thermos!!
1,Comparison between the Thermos Rock and Stanley Overtime,"I have both the Thermos Rock and the Stanley overtime. I filled them both up exactly at the same time with boiling water, headed to the snow and after 4 hours opened them both up. The liquid in the Stanley Overtime was warm, but the liquid in the Thermos Rock was still too hot to drink. I would not recommend the Stanley Overtime as the Thermos puts out a much better product."
4,Best for those who have already read many of the other Nero Wolfe novels,"While I greatly enjoyed reading the Black Mountain, it was, in part, the fact that it was so different from the other novels that I found it fascinating. Throughout the series there are somewhat vague references to Wolfe's life before coming to the U.S. This novel fills in much of that back-story, and gives the avid fan a better idea of what makes Wolfe tick. However, I would have to agree with reviewers who don't recommend this book to someone new to the series. It is not consistent with the rest of the novels in the series in setting or tone, and is best enjoyed by those who appreciate the difference, as well as the additional insights into Wolfe's character and background."
3,"For True Nero Fans, Only","If you're new to Rex Stout and Nero Wolfe, you couldn't pick a worse place to start. However, if you already have an appreciation for the Nero/Archie banter and the nuances of the relationships with the minor characters, then you'll enjoy seeing them painted on a very different canvas, as far from the brownstone as they ever got.This book is neither as bad as the 1- and 2-star reviews suggest, nor as good as the 5-star reviews (including that of the audiobook's narrator, oddly) claim. I enjoyed it, but only because I've made my way through 80% of Stout's Nero Wolfe novels and novellas. As others have noted, Mr. Pritchard's voice and flat accent doesn't match up to those in the late, lamented A&E; series."
3,not my favorite nero wolfe,"I have read all but one Rex Stout Nero Wolfe book. I admit to being a Wolfe addict but this one I almost did not read given its premise-in this case I was not prepared to believe six impossible things before breakfast. No reviewer mentioned that Wolfe's adopted daughter was actually murdered near the ""Black Mountain"" in the title. This finally gets Wolfe moving but perhaps if he had been more reasonable when his daughter met with him she might still be alive. Unless you decide to read every Wolfe novel by Stout, I suggest you give this one a pass and read some of his best many of them among his earlier books."
2,"Away from the comforts of home, Nero not quite as interesting","It takes the murder of his closest friend to get Wolfe up; not only out of his chair but out of the country. Returning to Montenegro, Wolfe pursues the killer, amidst political intrigues and endless travels across unfriendly territory. The problem is what should prove to be a thrilling tale of vegeance becomes a travelogue from hell. Archie is along for...I'm not quite sure why he's there. He does a lot of standing around in the middle of a lot of dialogue he needs to have translated. The reversal of Archie's role is incredibly ineffective and this one once again proves that Wolfe is best behind his desk."
1,The worst Wolfe,"I'm an avid Wolfe fan, but this sucked. Even though Stout dashed off a few that were marginal, there was always an impossible mystery to be solved and the conflict between the rascal Archie and the egotistical Wolfe to keep it lively, while Stout worked the old formula. There was none of that here. This was a revenge plot that he tried to make happen with his familiar, decidedly non-vengeful, characters. And he sends them to Italy and Montenegro, but gives no evidence of even having bothered to look those countries up in an encyclopedia to give us some description of the foreign locales. Bad as this is, it's not as bad as ""Under the Andes"" (a non-Nero Wolfe tome) in that it's much shorter."
2,Wolfe's Silly Season,"Don't bother unless you've read all the good ones. Wolfe goes to his homeland (Montenegro) on a ridiculous mission. It comes from a period when Stout was trying to make his Wolfe books more sensationalist (also Even in the Best Families, The Golden Spiders). None of them really work. It can be good fun when Wolfe is derailed from his routine, but not here."
1,Nero Wolfe fans: This is the one to skip!,"I love Nero Wolfe and his street-smart sidekick Archie Goodwin. But ""The Black Mountain"" is just a bore. I couldn't finish it. Do yourself a favor and get ""The Rubber Band"" or ""Champagne for One"" instead."
2,Lack of Credibility,"So much disbelief must be suspended to enjoy Nero Wolfe. In this story, even more than usual has to be thrown out the window.That Nero would be loyal to Marko Vukcic is understandable. That he would personally endure the events of this book is a lot less easy to swallow.It's almost hard to read (or listen to) this one. While you appreciate Wolfe's passion and commitment, the setpieces Rex creates for him are beyond Wolfe's described capabilities.So, OK, even if you accept these sudden shifts, you then have to cope with a really hackneyed plot and very contrived and stereotypical situations ""behind the iron curtain."" If you wanted that, you could read John LeCarre and get much better writing.Skip it. However, Michael Prichard (see spotlight review) does his customarily thorough and convincing job reading it."
4,A book with excellent details on the subject!,"I was very much impressed by the detailed descriptions on the instrunts, frames and history of development of stereotactic and functional neurosurgery as a science. The methods and operative details are very good. It is a very good book for residents in neurosurgery and a must for every neurosurgery department. I fill the details of physiology and targeting the nuclei are not very elaborated and the details of newer techniques in functional neurosurgery are still developing and they may be revised in next edition.bhargavaatrivedi. (E- mail : dr_trivedi@satyam.net.in)"
1,Blah,Don't waste your money. Not worth the quality. Seems like something I could have bought from a high-end $1 store. One bulb came out just from me hanging it up the very first time and what a hassle to get the bulb out of its plastic holding with just a sticker of Dora on it and replace it.
5,Crystalline fretwork delights,I've always enjoyed Bau's musicianship on Cesaria Evora's albums. It is wonderful to be able to focus on his fretwork and enjoy it's crystalline purity. His playing here is even crisper and more fluid than when he is adorning vocals. He meets the challenge of stepping out as the lead voice.This is a very enjoyable album.
3,lousy distance,this two way radio is a kids toy. Bought it for $30.00 It says 5 miles as the distance but you can only get 1/4 mile if you are lucky... Motorola should return my money. I hope they read this. Total ripoff
3,motorola walkie talkie,i think it is okay in general....but a little bit of noise when the distance gets longer...
2,Not for ski trip,"I got them mostly for being very light and small. In the city it worked up to 1/5 of a mile, you can connect a bit more but hear only static. On a ski resort it only worked within the same building/lodge; you cannot connect to another radio even on the same side of the mountain. I'd return them, but as they are so small and sleek, we lost one on the second day."
1,Not worth it,This is an outdated model. If you find someone selling it in the original unopened factory package beware. The rechargeable batteries may have been sitting around unused for years. There's a good chance they are dead beyond resuscitation. I got my radios to work only when I put in standard nonrechargeable batteries but by the second day the speaker on one of the units gave out. I dont think I got more than a half hour of use out of these units before throwing them away. My kids have some toy walkie-talkies from Lego that are made better than these!
2,bad audio quality,transmitter audio quality is bad...people say it's hard to hear what I'm saying. Older motorola or newer uniden are much better.
2,TOY from motorola,"first, why does it say : BE THE FIRSTto REVIEW this item ?18 others reviewed it, i saw all thatand based on it, bot this item.sorry, but at least the 2 units i gotare pure junk.open road, nothing in line of sight,max it works for is about 300 yards.thats it.it s a toy.changed to many brands of batteries,sony, energizer, new alkalinesand 3 other brands of NimH fullyand properly charged batteriessoone cannot blame it on batteries at alli got more batteries nowthan most people have in their homes.too bad,was hoping for at least double that distance.300 yrds in open field.inside apt or house, max is about 4 floors, thruthe floorsinside elevator, whre you really might need it,it wont work...most mob fones wont, either, unlessthe elevator has been specailly wired up.thats thattreat as TOYif you get more than 300ydsyou are lucky !maybe yours are very diff from mineinternally.tksk"
3,Something went wrong,"They look great however whenever I walk more than a little, the toe beside my pinkie hurts and I get corns. P.S. they aren't too small for me so I don't know what went wrong. Not sure I would recommend them."
3,Fantastic,"I bought this CD because I love the REMIX version of Work it Out! I travel with this CD. When you need your soul uplifted, just pop this CD in and stomp those feet and clap those hands. Praising the Lord is what I like to do!!!"
1,didn't get what i paid for,the songs listed 1 thru 16 wasnt the songs on the cd. there were on only 12 songs. i wanted all the songs. i feel i didn't get what i paid for.
3,Old School Church Party,This is good aol fashion church- I get my praise on in my car and shout with my shoulders- thanks to Pandora I bout this uplifting CD.
2,mistakes galore!,I did one project in this book. It had mistakes in the instructions in every part of the construction. The publisher passed my request for clarification on to the author. She never responded.
3,"Cute patterns, not so sure about instructions","There are many patterns in here that are downright adorable (along with a few that a fugly of course, but so what!). My only concern is that I've made one bag so far where the instructions were far from clear. I'm not sure they were accurate or not because I just couldn't understand what they were getting at. I'm hoping when I try to make another that the instructions will be easier to follow."
3,Not a bad patterns book,"The crochet tutorials at the start of the book were fairly helpful.The patterns in general were a bit dull, and some instructions were not clear."
4,Nice,"I like this book. Quite a bit, actually. I do not crochet often but there are definitely some nice projects in this book I will try. I'm looking forward to the recycled beach bag made out of plastic bags. The projects are cute and imaginative but then Candi Jensen rarely disappoints."
2,A nice idea,"This book is a nice idea, but sadly falls a bit flat. There are a couple of really good ideas, especially the timely string bag for shopping etc, but generally these are really quite unusable in the real world. They are not particularly attractive and quite gimmicky. The layout is excellent as are the pictures and the simplicity of the patterns. A great idea that doesn't quite come off."
3,Very plain designs,"If you are looking for simple, basic designs then this is the book for you. Not alot of ""stand out"" patterns in here."
5,One great video,"Pinky & the Brain have to be one of the greatest cartoons ever made. It easily appeals to kids and adults alike. This video is a great start for any collection for fans of the cartoon or just cartoons in general. It contains three short episode; Pavlov's Mice, Brain Meets Brawn, Where Rodents Dare, and Tokyo Grows. All great episodes in the tradition of what this cartoon is like. I beleive they are from the early beginings of the show when it was a part of Animaniacs on the WB. Although it is a bit short, 37 minutes total, this video is a must buy, a great addition to your collection that will appeal to the entire family. Buy it now before you no longer can!"
5,"The Door is Open, The Light is Back On","Thanks to the overwhelming courage it took this couple to let the world in on their struggles with impotence, the rest of us...who suffer from a similar fate...have hope that we're not in this war solo. The ping-pong references, reflections between Keith and Gin, add a great deal to the absolute honesty the couple had in facing the situation. This is not ""her view"" vs. ""his view"" but rather a couple struggling together to find resolve. A must read for anyone who is afflicted with being cut off from an intimate relationship in their lives. Bravo Lakens!"
5,comforting,Being a married woman of 34 yrs & not having gone thru anything like the Laken's have gone thru I still forund their book very comforting. What an amazing couple to share the way they did in their book for the sake of helping others who have experienced what they have gone thru. I have a brother-in-law that has gone thru what Keith has & I am definately going to share this book with them & can't help but feel it will help.
4,"What a great, well written, book","depicting the life of a couple of likeable misfits in California's Bay Area in the mid 80's.The characters are very well fleshed out and the story has soul, pace and , I suspect, a lot of autobiographic elements ( could the Author be Will, I ask ? ).Absolutely worth reading and enjoying, for its in ""your face "" reality and the unreproachable prose.Why not 5 stars, then? Because the Author looses himself, somewhat too much, in the 80's Oakland description and this, whether he wanted it or not, ends up cutting a bit of the pace in an otherwise irreprehensible novel."
3,It's ok...,"I have a lot of friends and colleagues who love this book, and find it a very useful reference when they get into the mathematical-type trouble. It is used at this University at the undergraduate level for math methods. I prefer Arfken's ""Mathematical Methods For Physicists"" as I think it is way more indepth and way clearer."
1,Horrible book,"This book is one of the worst mathematical methods books i've seen. When it starts out a new subject it skims over the basics required to understand the subject, it has horrible examples, the problems dont enlighten you on the particular area of mathematics that is being studied, it briefly mentions important concepts, states theorems without proofs or even giving a reason why they stated it. Nearly half of the book is calc 2-3 + diff eq. This book is really just an engineering book, your learn how to plug numbers in and get your answer. Physics isnt about plugging numbers or equations in, its about using math to describe physical phenomena, so a deep understanding of math is needed to really grasp what's happening, and this book is horrible at it. If your looking for a good book on mathematical methods, look atMathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics"
4,Physics Book,Has the instructions to a lot of mathematical tools. It is somewhat of a hard read. It only has a few answers to problems in the back of the book.
1,Digital Version Sux,The digital version is full of errors in the text...its a rip off. Buy the hardcopy instead. I want my money back.
5,Great reference text,"As an undergraduate physics major I'm required to take a course in math methods of physics, and Boas is the required text. Not only did I save money by purchasing online, but this book is FANTASTIC. The text itself support the arguments we cover in class, but the book knows no bounds. In my other physics and math courses I've already looked up topics and found a complete and easily understood explanations. I'm definitely not selling this one after the course is over.Just as an update, I'm now taking a course in Complex Analysis with my college's math department, and three weeks into the semester have yet to experience any difficulty with the material since, for the most part, I covered it already in Boas."
2,Missing some content,"Although this book was convenient to have in Kindle format, it proved to be very problematic when it came to do homework problems due to the fact that some characters and portions of text were missing. I'm not talking about content either, I'm talking about parts of words, important characters and portions of problems, among other things. When making text books available in digital format it would be nice to have some quality control entity that checks for completeness and accuracy of the product. What was the point of getting this book on Kindle if I still have to copy the problems from the physical book of one of my classmates?"
5,It's mine,"This book was so popular that I ran out of my books so I have to purchase it on line, some new and some used. I think it's my best book and still in demand. Jacqueline Penney"
4,Painting Greeting Cards in Watercolor,"I live in Australia so expected 3 to 4 weeks for delivery of this book, it came in less than 2 weeks so was plesently suprised with it's early arrival and it was well packed. I really enjoy the step by step projects how too's, and tips and tricks with lots of pictures to guide you."
4,"Good, Very configurable, but slows down the system...",I have been using it with XP for 6 months now. No major problems. It does tend to slow the loading of web pages and other network traffic (not as bad as web pages). You can end up spending a lot of time customizing it if you want high security. You can allow individual sites varying degrees of access to run scrips. It STOPS POP-UP WINDOWS cold! This is my favorite feature! If it did nothing but stop pop-ups it would still be worth the $$.
1,Awful!,"I would just like to comment very briefly on this product, that all seemed to be doing well and it did manage to work very well for a number of weeks. However it completly prevented me from viewing any websites under a 'secure server' Its caused me many wasted days with little access to the net. Money down the drain for this product, avoid!"
1,Not a good product,"You can't get firewall protection from a piece of software. Norton Firewall is more annoying than it is helpful. If you want firewall protection buy an actuall router/firewall. Linksys 4 Port Cable/DSL Router will do the job without the hassle. It's an actual hardware firewall for only $30 more than this software. Installation couldn't be easier, just plug in your cable or DSL line, and you're done! And you can network your house with it (if you want)."
1,A Very Spotty Product,"Norton Personal Firewall 2002 is neither the easiest-to-use product of its type, nor does it offer the best protection.I found the program to be very tempermental: it worked very well when I first installed it, but it stopped working altogether shortly thereafter. Even after I got it working again, it failed to protect against TCP probes (a very common hacker attack).I am not a internet security expert, although I am generally very comfortable with complex software, and I simply could not get this program to work reliably.Do yourself a favor and try ZoneAlarm Pro instead: I found it to offer much better security, more reliable operation, and to be much easier to control."
1,Big disappointments,"Norton Firewall 2003 failed to install correctly on my Windows XP Pro machine with 512MB of memory! Every time I tried I got a blue screen with ""Dumping physical memory"", despite following the installation procedures to the letter. When I finally managed to install the program, it blocked a large number of websites, including symantec's own! And yes, I allowed pretty much everything on the setup screen. I finally gave up after three days, wrote the investment off and downloaded Black Ice. Installed correctly the first time, has been running with no problems whatsoever and has caught 20+ hackers in the past 24 hours. I am sure my experience with Norton Firewall is down to my failing somehow but I do not have the time and the patience to ""investigate""."
3,The Microcontroller Idea Book,"The Microcontroller Idea Book : Circuits, Programs & Applications Featureing the 8052-Basic Single-Chip Computer by Jan Axelso"
1,waste of money!,"i wonder if those people at SOny took a moment to watch the final product, before they put it out in the market! i am sure they didn't.the audio is one of the worst that i have ever experienced and what happened to subtitles, i guess it would cost a buck or two for the improve the quality for us funs.Heads up and BRAVO TO COLUMBIA producing the first two seasons.Sony watch out 'cause you are bringing cheap ... in the market and costumers are getting tired of it!wish i had kept my money and spend it something else!!!"
5,And they said it was never gonna happen my friend,"This probably isn't my favorite season, but after the very long wait, it was quite rewarding. It never achieved the ultra hilarity or super mushiness i came to expect after sets 1 and 2, but it's still better than anything currently being run.Bring on season 4!"
5,DVD review,DVD arrived quickly and was very reasonably priced. These are a yearly Christmas gift and recipient is alway very happy with this gift.
5,Where are the rest of the seasons? I'll buy them!,"An avid Netflixer here, I have gone out and bought each and every MAD product released. I love this show, and have really loved seeing these years works again. I am also looking forward to seeing the later years which I largely missed for ""life"" reasons.As I recall, in its hayday MAD was often overshadowed by the funny but very overrated Seinfeld show. The more thoughtful and touching MAD work took an undeserved back seat in media frenzy and water cooler chatter. Perhaps because Seinfelds outrageousness was easier to discuss, and MAD touched parts of our hearts that was harder to discuss casually.Whatever, it is great to see it available. We want more!"
3,be warned,"the book is remade by robots and it's full of typos. you can make out the words, but its still a rip off. look into how the book is being made before you buy."
1,Modern vs. postmodern thought,"Despite the vast amount of knowledge displayed by the author, Forsyth's work has fallen to the thought process of the now approatching 21st century student of music. This work, however creditable in it's day, simply is far too outdated for the post modern academia.(First publication:1914!) I would recommend this book for the general research of musical practice in the early part of the 20th century. However it would be of no use for the progress of the comming music of future composers."
5,Very Good Read,I am an amateur orchestrationist and I loved this book. The history of the instruments gave me a greater understanding of each group and their strengths and weaknesses. I hope everyone who has an interest in instrumentation would read and study this book.
1,Essentially Unusable,"Please note that this is a review of the 'General Books' edition of this work only.Cecil Forsyth, (or 'FORKYTH' as this edition would have it), may indeed have written an eminently usable book, but this edition is anything but that. It is apparently a raw OCR copy of an earlier edition, including headings such as the following ""ITiii, 3. MODEKN OUOKKSTIIAI, VALVK-HuuN"" (at 63). While most of the text has not been quite as badly garbled, they layout (it is not visually apparent where one chapter or section begins or ends, what is a chapter heading vs example text, etc), makes it impossible to locate specific information and very difficult to read.If you want this book, spend the extra money buying an edition upon which a modicum of editorial effort has been exercised."
2,Not an All Temperature Adhesive,"Dont let the title of the glue ""All Temperature"" fool you like it did me. I used it to glue a part on a mold that I pour lead into that reaches over 600 degrees. The part came loose in less than 5 minutes after I had let it cure for 24 hours. I didnt read the small writing which says that its heat rating is about 300 degrees. So I got fooled by the title so dont make the same mistake I did. This is probably a good glue if used in the right temperature but this is definitely not an all temperature adhesive."
5,works fine with my browsers!,"I'm puzzled by the complainer from CT who can't run Tax Cut without Internet Explorer. The software doesn't require a web browser to run, though of course you need one to update it or get online help. I tried unloading IE and loading Opera. Then I loaded Tax Cut and clicked on online help. It connect to the Tax Cut website without any complaint. If there's a problem here, it may be with Netscape. I can't check, because I recently installed Netscape 7.01 and it won't connect to the web at all!"
1,Seriously buggy---may cost me big time,"This software has a serious bug that may cost me a great deal of money.My wife lived in Illinois for a year while I lived most of the year in California. In such a case, it is imperative that we file our Federal returns separately, otherwise Illinois will tax us on the money I earned in California!TaxCut not only didn't warn us of this, it incorrectly computed the Illinois taxes using the part-year resident form. This was in spite of my having specified that my wife was in Illinois the whole year, and in spite of it being very plainly stated on the Illinois form that under such circumstances, a couple filing jointly could not use the form!Unfortunately, I allowed TaxCut to e-file my return before I checked the state returns. Now I have to file an amendment.I was also unable to get any help from TaxCut's customer support to stop the e-filing before it went through.I'll never use their software again."
2,Beware the hidden charges!,"Yes, it costs only...and (after jumping through hoops) you can get [a] rebate. But check the fine print on the back of the box and you find, ""TaxCut State sold separately.""...My state return is really rather simple once the federal one's done, but TaxCut wants [extra] for the state software. And when you get ready to e-file, Voila!, that costs extra, too...Add to this the unhelpful Help and Search features. And on Schedule A, the program blithely allowed me to enter the state tax I had paid, even though it had already done that for me. I caught the duplication when I finally got a look at the form itself. The ultimate frustration came when TaxCut locked up my computer as I tried to print my record copies of the forms. I'll try something else next year."
4,You can pick it up and put it down whenever you want,"Virgin is a series of short stories by first-time writers. That's not necessarily why it's so good! The reason it's good is because it ranges from topics like prostitution to a sister who has trouble dealing with the fact that her older sister is getting married. The stories are very well written and a breeze. Definitely a ""subway"" book. For those people who might only have a few minutes."
2,"sorry, not a winner this time, please try again","though many parts of this book (one or two of the stories) were really quite good, some - ""end of the belt line""- lacked anything that would make it worth reading. If you're loking for one or two good stories, pick this up; if you want a whole book full, keep looking."
1,Useless for any other than your state of current residence,Will not allow you to electronically file with a state of prior residence. Did not provide or support many of the forms for Wisconsin. Really has trouble with W2's from different states.It was a waste of money.
2,Limited number of forms,"I was frustrated when I found that the California version does not include the Form 3510 (CREDIT FOR PRIOR YEAR ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX) which I feel should be needed by many in the Silicon Valley where incentive stock options are popular. The customer support instructed me to download the form from California's FTB web site, then print it out, fill it in with pen, then plug in the numbers to the proper places in the program. And because the form has to be mailed in, I cannot use e-filing. Oh well, what to expect when it is free!"
2,False errors prevented me from filing electronically,"I found both the federal and state versions of TaxCut to be inferior to TurboTax. The worst part that due to some ""errors"" (which were not errors at all) I was unable to file electronically.I would have felt much more confident filing my return if I had gone with TurboTax."
1,TaxCut for state stinks,"I used TurboTax (Federal) last year. That was my first experience using a tax preparation software instead of the paper form, a pen and my brain. It gave me a pretty pleasant result.This year I was lured to TaxCut due to various discounts - big mistake. I managed to get the Federal form completed after downloading the ""company planned"" updates. But the state version of TaxCut is more than useless. I need to fill taxes for two states and the CD in the State package can only install one state - the other state ""must"" be installed through website - not practical for my slow modem connection... I am trying to find the downloadable version for the second state."
1,"Sorry, you cant use this if you have been in state < 1 year","I had to pay cash for my State Tax (Arkansas) so when I read that the program would not apply if I lived in the state for less than than one year I was... I paid [$$] to be told ""Sorry you must use manual forms from your state""! How do you find this out?Load the Taxcut Federal Program, compute your tax. Load the state program and it computes your state tax with the ""Sorry"" caveat.If you have moved in the past year, don""t buy this program. If you pay nothing for it- you get what you pay for."
2,No surprises here,"It's nice to see a published work that dedicates some, but not enough, of its focus on the lyrical evidence that can be found throughout Tupac's massive body of work that tells of his disappearance. That being said, I don't think the proud, hard core, and faithful fans will find any surprises in this book. It did not give me chills as the cover said it would. This would be something for new fans of Tupac, or older fans that may finally want to explore things further. A quick read with some redundant material - this book could be even shorter, but still worth adding to a collection.Raise 'Em Up!"
1,Suggested Name Change -> Ghost 2002 LITE,"Background Information- Intended use was in a small business scenario.- Three machines, networked together.- Desire to backup drive images to a networked machine.This product is really limited. I happen to not have a FAT or FAT32 drive on any of my machines, and therefore cannot create an image of a drive and store it on a networked machine. Also, having to type in the serial number everytime you want to perform any work is a feature I'm used to in shareware....only problem is, I remember paying for this coffee coaster.I'm definitely going to look for an alternative product."
1,It just doesn't work,"Many attempts to backup files from hard disk to CD-R's failed. So much time and so many CDs wasted that it is unacceptable. The system I have is Pentium 4 1.7GHz, 40GB IBM hard drive, 512MB RAM and Sony CRX 140E writer.Please make yourself a favor and save your money and time."
1,Wish I could give it 0 Stars,"Where Drive Image has solved so many of our problems, Norton Ghost has caused even more. Symantec support is also non existant. I guess once they have your money, they don't want to hear from you any longer. I have received no help or constructive help from either customer service or technical support. Don't waste your money!"
2,Could Have been a Great Product,"Ghost has great potential but there are still bugs to be ironed out. I tested it on a Windows 98 system and a Windows XP system. The test was to backup my systems to CD-R's. The backups worked flawlessly but the Integrity Check to verify the backups, told me my CDs contained errors and that I had to start all over again. Also, Ghost caused my Windows 98 system to lock up repeatedly to the point way I had to re-install the operating system."
1,"Maybe it'll work for your computer, maybe not","Ghost is not only cumbersome to use (two seperate boot floppies for CD-writing and CD-reading operations!?), but surprisingly spotty for a DOS application. Even Symantec's support site admits a long line of possible hardware compatibility problems with not only CD-RW drives, but with CD-R disks themselves! Although Ghost will record backups on 700MB CD-Rs on my computer with no problem, it has great difficulty reading off of those 700MB CD-Rs afterwards. It works okay with 640MB CD-Rs, but since those are becoming increasingly scarce, I will have to opt for much slower backups on 640MB CD-RWs. Bottom line: if you buy this tool and backup on 700MB CD-Rs, you better verify the backup afterwards. Symantec makes a lot of great products; Norton Ghost is not one of them."
1,Scaled down and brain dead,"This software is a real MARKETING breakthrough! They have taken away the ability to backup across the network via an ftp or rsh server. I ended up sending it back and getting my money returned. The package promises, ""...cloning using home network IP connections..."" This is true however you must be running their DOS server software on the server. Also, their server doesn't support NTFS or EXT2 partitions for saving the image. I ended up developing my own system using Linux (dd | gzip | rsh) for FREE! I spent a better part of a week wasted on this product. If you want to duplicate a harddrive in the same machine then it will probably do what you want but don't expect to use your network connection reliably. Also, it comes with a paltry amount of drivers for USB external CD Drives. Not recommended for any situation where the hard drive you want to backup is not in the same system as the spare hard drive."
1,"Hurt my system, and now I'm stuck with it",I purchased Norton Ghost to see how it compared to Drive Image. It damaged my system and required me to do a low-level format of my hard drive. I had to restore my system using Drive Image. Now Symantec won't refund my money. Seems like I'm stuck with it. Beware!!!
5,LHA,"When ordering anything online what is important is user ease, security, and service delivery. It helps that the product is as advertised. All of these things I found to be in good stead with this experience and would have no trepidation about subsequent orders."
3,Major Cool Points,"It's Ok. I didn't quit reading it or anything, but I think this book still exists in the ""canon"" because reading the book is such a challenge, and people are scared to say they didn't dig it because they fear that they failed some deeper understanding of it. You'll need a dictionary to get through it, and once you actually complete the book, it's cool to be able to say ""I've read 'Look Homeward, Angel'."" I know I definitely have it on my bookshelf where everyone can see it. I prefer Tobias Wolff whose books are right next to Thomas' on the Barnes and Noble bookshelves."
3,It's okay,"The book was more marked up than I expected, but it was cheap & arrived in a timely fashion, so no complaints."
1,I can't believe I had to finish this horrible book,"I am writing this review to protect others who might mistakenly pick this book as I recently did for my book club. It was well reviewed, a classic and highly recommended. Yet it was the most self absorbed, boring and uninteresting book we have read. NO ONE in my book club finished except me and I had to because I was to lead the discussion. Maybe we just aren't literate enough because we actually want to enjoy what we read. If you're the same I'd stay away from this book. Everyone hated it. 'Nough said."
4,More than Gants,"The rhetoric is there, the poetry is there and the story of a generation that wasn't ""lost"" is there. Whitman, Poe, Melville and Fitzgerald all between the boards of one book.For those pilgrims willing, the complete ms. is available as O Lost that gives us the story before Mr. Perkins intervened.All of Wolfe is worth reading for the sheer enjoyment."
4,The spirit of the South in this portrayal of a time & place.,"Wolfe catches the spirit of the South in this accurate portrayal of a time and place. His descriptions bring the picture vividly to life. You smell the smells, hear the sounds, etc. Unfortunately there are few positive characters, especially women. Young Gant's sexual experiences were particularly devastating and crude. Realistically the young man never finds the answers to his questions, the peace he looks for, the solution to his problems. That was a disappointment. But this book is still a must read for it's snapshot in time and character development!"
4,A challenging work of art,"I read this book, and it took me a while, but in the end, I was satisfied by the book. There is no way around it- Wolfe uses more words than most people are interested to read. I myself at times got tired of crawling at a snales pace, and I skipped or skimmed parts of the book. But the book does get progressively better. If you can't read the whole thing, read the last two hundred pages, and you'll have a pretty good idea of the story. If you want a book to challegnge you,(and try your patience at times) this one should. If you are interested in quick and exciting reading, this isn't the book for you. The ending will make you think about life in general- a good accomplishment for any book in any genre."
2,"It may be a Southern classic, but I'm crossing it off my list","Sadly, I don't get what the big deal is about this novel. It is boring and plodding and pointless. It just goes on and on and on, and I kept asking myself, `What's the point?' I kept waiting to be wowed, and instead I found myself wishing I'd never begun reading it.Quite honestly, I think Wolfe is overrated. He's nowhere close to being a Hemingway or a Faulkner. The entire novel is just a bunch of nothing, really. There's no substance to the ""story"" at all. In a way, he reminds me of Stephenie Meyer. She can't write either, and she takes forever to get to the point too.I've finished it and I'm still not sure what the ""story"" was about. It just seemed like this rambling mess with no plot. The only thing I know for certain is that the entire Gant family was crazy. That's about the only thing I got out of Look Homeward, Angel."
5,The American Masterpiece,"Far better than Mark Twain, this is the best American Marterpiece ever written. What else is their to say, except that he wrote in a completely free style in another time period which makes some people unhappy. Long after the trash written by copycats like Jack K. has been discarded, Thomas Wolfe's masterpiece will remain."
2,"Look Howeard, Angel","So far I can't seem to get into it. The initial guy seems odd to me, Oliver, though I keep waiting and maybe the theme isn't so much him as what he goes through. He just seems to lack much smarts or wisdom as I see it. Then he wonders why life is beating him up? He definitely needs a strong woman to keep him in line and maybe I should feel sorry for him. I'll stick it out though I am reading it nightly and maybe it will turn around.......ask me about 3 weeks from now I may have to eat my words. My brother highly recommended it."
2,Giving it up again,"This is the second time I have attempted to read this novel in it's entirety and I'm not going to make it. I feel like I am mired in quicksand and am sinking under the weight of all those words. I realize that by abandoning this project once again I am missing out on some brilliant writing, stunning imagery, amd memorable metaphors. Oh Lost!A note about the racism: Apparently I am supposed to tolerate the stereotypical descriptions of African-Americans because, after all, Wolfe was a product of the South and we can't expect him to have known any better. I'm not buying it. Wolfe was a highly educated world traveler who read hundreds of books before writing this novel. Yet he can't use the word ""Negro"" without prefacing it with ""sleepy."" Wolfe has great insight into the tragic condition of humanity, but that humanity is apparently white only. Again, I didn't finish the novel so I am open to all forms of beratement if I missed something that contradicts my view on this."
4,Look Homeward Angel,"A fine copy of a classic novel. Wolfe can be a little boring so one must be in the right mood, but I'm glad that I have this in my library."
1,Look Homeward Angel,"While I am thoroughly enjoying the book, this particular edition is awful!!! I don't know who if anyone edited this, but the rules of word division are totally ignored. Words just go to the end of the page and continue on the next line. As for paragraphs, they, too, follow no known rules. All of this, makes this edition very difficult and frustrating to read. I highly recommend buying the more expensive edition."
4,The best autobiographical novel of the 20th century!,"The descriptive language and the use of metaphor were wonderful.The characters were actual residents of Asheville, N.C. who recognized themselves and made Tom Wolfe a pariah for many years. He is now remembered by the statue of an angel in a cemetary in Hendersonville, N.C. I enjoyed it a lot!"
3,This is NOT a fast read!,"If you're looking for light reading, this is not for you!Thomas Wolfe's writing is akin to old Victorian furniture...ornate,heavy, and cumbersome,but with its own particular beauty.Wolfe is in love with the language, almost to a fault.I found his descriptive style tedious at times, piled high with far too many adjectives.This coming-of-age story is sweet within itself.And Wolfe gives us an interesting and detailed historical description of the area around Altamount, North Carolina,and the city of Boston, and Harvard University. The thoughts and feelings of a bright and talented young man trying to find his way in the world, weave their way throughout the fabric of the story.If you are willing to forge your way through all the heavy prose, this would be worth your while. But this tome is NOT for the faint of heart."
1,Unreadable,"I could not read the book. The product was defective and it could not be read, it would not line up on the page correctly. When speaking with someone at Kindle they told me they were not able to fix the problem and would have to send it back to the book company. I was sorry because I really wanted to read Look Homeward Angel."
1,Pretentious and dull,"This is a book about Wolfe's boring southern life. It's cliche to the extreme: ""romantic"" young man goes to university, laments the fact that he is so much more intelligent than others, wishes people could understand him, returns home and looks down on everybody there. Unfortunately Wolfe is not close to being intelligent or interesting (and he certainly is not a genius as he himself said!). Wolfe obviously thinks that everything that has happened in his life will be of interest to the reader, after all he holds himself to be a genius, but one immediately sees how self-important he is, and how seriously he takes his ridiculous outlook. This is a nostalgic book; if you want to read a nostalgic book, read some Proust or Nabokov, who both soar above Wolfe, and let Wolfe be forgotten as he soon will be."
2,Don't Believe the Hype - A Dull Read,"Of all the supposed American ""classics"" I've read, this is the dullest of the lot, and, given the overtly racist observations, a poor suggestion for young readers. While the characterization of the family is unparalleled, the book, at 500 pages, is about 200 pages too long, and Wolfe takes way too many liberties with his flowery anglophile prose, repeating ad nauseum the same pithy poetic quotes. The book also serves as a painful reminder of our not-so-distant past, with numerous insulting racist commentaries regarding African-American and Jewish peoples. As a slice of history, and a gripping family portrait, this book is worth a read, but in pure story-telling talent and artistry, Wolfe pales in comparison to the other writers of the era (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner). Thumbs down."
1,Don't bother,Someone from my book club selected this as their recent choice. Out of 8 people not one person liked the book. We found the writing to be tedious as well as pompous and the storyline to be dull. Our interest was not sparked and most of us quit before we finished. Life is too short to read bad books.
1,Look Homeward Angel,"I was keen to read this novel, as it inspired many authors, including Pat Conroy...It was written many years ago, the author deceased in 1938....However the writing is inspiring and will stay in my memory as a special novel."
1,"Sorry, Guys, I'd Have to Disagree","I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through). It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere. I do not recommend this book."
4,Great Camera,The camera is robust even in daily use and rough conditions.... Careful with condensation... the camera is very sensitive to water... only problem is the back loading its very time consuming to change the cassete when on stand....
1,I do not recommend,"I bought a whole block of these ""silverpoint"" wustoff knives thinking I would be getting a fairly decent knife considering their reputation even though it was their lower end. My husband and I are very disappointed. The knives are thin, flimsy and bendy...not good when you need to cut a very crusty slice of bread or anything else a little tougher. They aren't as sharp as I was expecting either. I would have been better buying a cheaper brand with a thicker, more solid metal part. I guess if you're going to go for Wustoff...go for their expensive knives, because in their case, you get what you pay for...and less."
4,It works.,"Nothing really to say about this knife set. I got it as part of promotion for buying something else here on Amazon, otherwise I wouldn't have purchased it.Holding it, it is very non-impressive. Nothing outstanding about it.But what can I say? I've had it for a few years and it has performed admirably, no issues whatsoever.If you need a bread knife and the price is right for you on this one (sorry, it was free for me), then get it."
3,The Quiet - gives us something to talk about,"WHAT THE BOX DOESN'T TELL YOUThe truth, but that is meant as compliment in every way. Trailers and the less than extrodinary DVD case would have you believe you're renting another run of the mill thriller, which unapologetically casts its young beauties in roles they are more well known for centering around angst-ridden teen struggles situations of mild horror. Expect something different.WHY I WOULD RENT IT AGAINThere's some deep situations both girls encounter on their road back to friendship and their individual fight for emotional survival. The movie won't leave you feeling empty inside. Good direction by Jamie Babbit ensures you'll get from beginning to end without encountering weak segues."
2,Boring,"There is a family of three - a mother, father and a daughter. They adopt a deaf girl who has just lost her father. The deaf girl is struggling to mix in at the high school and with her new family. The family is dysfunctional and not even one character in this movie was likeable. The mother is an alcoholic, and a pill popper, the father sexually abuses his daughter and the daughter is following in her mother's footsteps and experimenting with drugs. Some issues are covered such as how life would be for a deaf person, and incest. The acting is ok, the storyline is average and the movie goes at a slow pace. Overall it was a pretty boring movie and I didn't walk away with anything. I forgot all of the characters names after the movie was over."
4,Can't go wrong with two beautiful women,The story started out real slowly but gets really interesting fast. It's almost cat and mouse like with the two leading ladies.They both are carrying secrets and soon learn each other's secret. Then it gets really interesting. I'm glad I bought this Movie and I highly recommend it.
3,Better than I thought.,"I rented this movie expecting a corny thriller with some very pretty faces and perhaps some risque subject matter. While this movie didn't deliver what I was originally looking for, I did find it enjoyable. The real premise of this movie, to paint a complex interpersonal story using an involved but highly passive narrator (Dot), proves its potential in this movie, but this movie falls flat in many other ways. I found the dialog in this movie to be unconvincing and distracting, and the plot had numerous holes, making the entire story seem half baked. The movie paints a very interesting perspective on some very disturbing subject matter, but the many distractions in the film prevented me from following the emotions of the characters. I think this movie is worth a rent, but I wouldn't buy it."
3,Creative and Interesting,"The Quiet was pretty well written in terms of certain characters, such as Camilla Belle and Elisha Cuthberts role. But I think the middle and ending could of been better in refrence to certain scenes in the movie."
4,a semi spoiler review,"I have to say that this movie just totally blew me away. This was truely worthy of some award. The acting was superb, the music fit in brilliantly with the movie and this is an honest dark film. The only reason I did not give this movie 5 stars was because the secret that Dot possessed was obvious throughout the entire movie. The director could have done a bit more to conceal this until later into the movie. I am not going to lie and say that everybody should see this movie. To be honest, you should watch it with an open mind. This is mainly due to the fact that the this movie does deal with an incestuous relationship between a father and his daughter. I am in no way condoning incest but this movie is well worth the watch. I sat there at the end of the movie with my mouth open still trying to comprehend all that had happened in the movie. Hopefully you will not be dissapointed. At the very least, rent it before you decide to buy it."
3,girl in a difficult situation,"Elisha Cuthbert plays a girl, Nina, who doesn't know what to do. Her father has an incestuous relationship with her. She loves her father, but at the same time hates him for what he makes her do.Ninas parents godchild, ""the mute"" Dot, becomes one in the family after the death of her father. She turns the life around for Nina who starts to have a strange bond to Dot.The film is intence, exciting and somewhat heavy cause to the topic (the incest).Both Elisha and Camilla Belle (Dot) are good in the main characters. But Martin Doonovan as the father and Edie Falco as the mother makes lifeless performances. Donovan and Falco are the reason I just gives the film 3 stars and not 4."
1,This one doesn't 'cut it',"The cutter looks like it should do a good job, but when in use it falls short in many areas.- cutting edge catches at the top and you have to pull the handle to the right to free from the catch, then return the handle into the base to continue the cut- it cuts crooked on all but the thinnest papers- the cutting edge does not handle even slightly thick paper such as glossy photo paper stock thickness. It pushes the paper instead of cutting it- the cutting arm pivot mechanism is not smooth and it has halting movement as you lower the armSave your money and buy a commercial grade cutter. If I find one that works, I'll edit this review with the model I bought."
2,"I wonder what their idea of ""light duty"" is?","If this is a heavy-duty paper cutter, I'd hate to see what X-Acto thinks of as ""light duty."" This piece of junk can't even handle 10 pages without ripping. I suspect that the axle is weak. The flimsy plastic arm does a poor job of holding the blades square against each other, even when that flaw is taken into account. I feel accomplished that I am now able to achieve only 25% waste when using this product. Considering that color laser prints cost probably $.10/each, that's only 2.5 cents wasted per print! It adds up to buying something other than X-Acto."
1,review,"This is a very poorly engineered recording. The piano is heard somewhere in the background, as if it is somewhere ""far far away lost in the woods"" producing some echoed sounds sometimes. The orchestra sounds much louder than the piano. There is no real dialogue of the piano with the orchestra here. The pieces are designed by the composer as if they are not concerts for piano and orchestra, but symphonic works for orchestra and piano. I regret buying this CD. I wish I could have given 0 stars if there were a choice of that."
2,"Good, but flimsy","I liked these, but stored them in a camera bag that received scant abuse. After awhile, the weakness of the PLASTIC fork-shaped piece which joins the head-strap to the earpieces revealed itself. SNAP.The rest of these is built so well, but when this piece goes, it's dumpster time. A needless design flaw."
4,"Solid headphones, especially for the price.","Overall I very much enjoy these. The cord is long enough, the sound quality is excellent, and the sound dampening is acceptable. much more durable than the Sennheisers I had before these. (replaced the Sennheisers not because I was unhappy with them, but because I broke them.)My only complaint is that the tension in the spring is a bit much, and the pressure makes my ears hurt after a while. But, I do have a fairly large head, so your mileage may vary.Regardless of some discomfort, for the price, I can't think of anything else I'd rather buy."
2,Not well versed in matters Calhounian.,"Prof. Niven's book fails on a number of counts, but mainly on that of familiarity with the sources of Calhoun's political thought. For example, in describing Calhoun's indebtedness to the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, Niven says that neither document contemplated action by an individual state. To correct this impression, one need only consult Jefferson's draft of the Kentucky Resolutions; how anyone who had even read this five-page document could see it as anything other than a threat to interfere with enforcement of the Alien and Sedition Acts within the boundaries of Kentucky is beyond me. The book is full of similiar evidence of Niven's failure to acquaint himself with even the most basic sources. Try Bartlett's Calhoun biography, instead."
1,Not Worth the Price,"Use - fixing eyeliner mistakesPro's the shape of the qtip was perfectCon's the amount of liquid on the qtip was way to much making a small mistake a big mistakeResult - great in theory not so much in practice, bk to using plain old qtips"
5,Great American Musicals,"Nostalgic melodies from the great Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals along with Show Boat, Porgy and West Side Story superby arranged and constructed into miniature symphonic suites by that genius of orchestral technique Robert Russell Bennett. The extended length of these allows for the inclusion of some of the lesser known tunes from the shows. Wonderful playing by RLPO under Carl Davies. Sheer enjoyment and excellent value 2 CD set."
3,Decent Regimental History,"Mr. Maier has written an average regimental history. His research is pretty solid, although I thought that some more research on the 119th's involvement in the Shenandoah campaign would be nice. The maps are OK...there could be more and they could be better quality, but they suffice for someone with some knowledge of the battles described. Mr. Maier's writing style is not the greatest...it just doesn't flow all that well and the text is marred by some typos. Rather typical of the regimental histories recently written by amateur historians...unremarkable but a solid history of a regiment's service. Nothing special to recommend it over other regimental histories, but for those with a special interest in the regiment, this will do the job fine."
4,Still in Competition,"When Deben Bhattarcharya made these field recordings back in 1978, I doubt if there was any music from Mauritania available in the West. Now there are quite a few discs to buy, some of them studio recordings of excellent vocalists or groups. I am pleased to report that this cd holds up very well against the competition, not only in terms of artistic appeal, but of sound quality. It is always a pleasure to hear the distinctive and alluring style of Mauritanian music, and to compare versions of the same song from now and then. I'm surprised to discover, for instance, that there's so little difference between the performance of K'Hall Kar here, and other versions in my collection of considerably more recent vintage."
4,"So far, so good","This is the first of these drives that I have bought, so I don't know a whole lot about them. What I can say is that I have been happy with it so far (I bought it a couple of weeks ago). You just plug it into the USB port and start dropping files into it. No problems. The one negative aspect is the ring that it attaches to so you can put it on your key ring. It keeps falling out of the unit making the drive very easy to lose. I decided to epoxy the ring that comes in the package directly to the drive. It shouldn't be coming off again any time soon."
3,"Best of Don ""The Dragon's"" flicks","This is the best (admitedly that's not saying much) of überawful Don ""the Dragon"" Wilson's chop socky flicks, redeemed by good writing and a story that holds your interest. Some good martial arts action, as well. If you want to turn off your brain for an evening, this is a good call."
5,Fun with another kind of toy.,"This toy is fun and called the attention of all every were we took if. A fun toy to own, and to have."
5,Superfood,"This escargot is the perfect addition to any meal featuring Burgundy Wine. To this date, I have prepared several dishes featuring this particular brand of escargot consisting of:Patrician Escargot-mushrooms stuffed with EscargotParley Pesto EscargotEscargot with wild riceSnail Butter to top various seafood dishes with (extremely delicious topped on scallops)With Escargot consisting of primarily protein and about 10 calories per snail, (until you add butter) it remains a very fulfilling and easily prepared meal. The average cleanup for the cooking endeavor remains at roughly one pot, a spoon, and a food processor in cases such as snail butter or parsley pesto sauce."
5,Confluence,"Bach takes the reader into his domain, a small piece of heaven. The whole story exists within a second. One of bach's better stories!!"
2,A bit too preachy and pretty..,"I grew up reading Johnathon Livingston Seagull over and over, and became a fan of Richard Bach after reading a few of his other books later in life, but with One it seems he's become too comfortable in his role as an always-inspiring and thought-provoking author, and didn't strain himself to be either. The book rambles on quite a bit and has an extremely different tone than something like Illusions. Still made you think a few times, but I definitely didn't feel at all enlightened when reading it. Very mushy and soft throughout, and occasionally even preachy and self-righteous. I'd recommend one of his earlier books over this."
4,"Recalls some of the greatness of ""The Bridge Across Forever""","I really love Richard Bach's _Bridge Across Forever_ - truly, it's one of my favorite books. _One_ reminds me quite a lot of _Bridge_, but lacks the awe-inspiring inspiration of that earlier work.While _One_ is definitely an enjoyable read, and contains some wonderful passages and wisdom, it is often saccharine and somewhat preachy. Bach will occasionally phrase questionable ideas as absolute fact, which doesn't sit well with me, and, although I have a reasonable tolerance for ""hokey"" stuffs, Bach pegged the meter more than a few times in _One_.While it is, without a doubt, thought-provoking and insightful, and shouldn't be dismissed out-of-hand, I feel that _Bridge_ is a thoroughly better novel. Still, an enjoyable read, and if you're a fan of Bach's work, you will assuredly like it."
3,"not bad, rather simplistic...","I just happened to pull this book off the library shelf, not realizing that it was he who had written ""Johnathon Livingston"".Well, the book was okay. I really dont' know what else to say because that was about it. I read the whole thing, it wasn't TOO much of a stuggle, but it just wasn't my kind of thing. The language was rather simplistic. I felt like I was reading a story by a sixth-grader who was writing about another world. I found the ""undying love"" of the two characters and Lesli's constant exclamation of ""Richie!"" to be really annoying. But there were some parts, especially about The Pageites and their religion, that were absolutely brilliant. I just thought it was a shame that the rest of the book wasn't that impressive.So overall, it wasn't bad. There were just little things that I don't happen to enjoy, like the speaker and the author being the same person, whiny women, and stuff sounding like what I had written in the sixth grade."
4,What you do unto Others you do unto Yourself!,"Bach in the story One takes us on a spiritual journey to explore our power as creators in our own right, and how the illusion of many, separate, and apart seduces us into renouncing our reality, and our ONEness.In the words of Shakespeare we are all actors on a stage and the earlier we stop mistaking the play for reality the earlier we can start recognizing the message each play brings to us and start acquiring wisdom.If you ever wondered the ""why"" this world or ""why"" am i here this book is for you!"
3,Not Richard's best book,"This book has none of the charm of A Bridge Across Forever. Whatever one may think of Richard Bach's philosophy, that volume at least had warmth and character. This volume feels too much like taking a tired old car out for another spin. It does have its moments, for instance the section about religion and the fate of ""The Pages"". Perhaps it is me, and I have simply grown out of Richard Bach. Perhaps too, my skepticism increased when his publishers started issuing volumes with double space between the lines, double space between paragraphs, and 2 inch margins around the text."
5,Makes you redefine your perspective...,"Have you ever thought you understodd how the world works? Have you thought you had your life straightened out and going on the right path? Have you known where you're going and what you'll be doing a year or two from now? Then this book is for you. It will either reaffirm your solid grasp on things (hehe) or totaly flip your concept of life upsidedown. Whether you're a physicist, a philosopher, a theist, or athiest, this book will speak to you in some way if you'll let it. Come in with an open mind and a discerning heart."
5,bach book,Thanks so much - it's a great book - would surely recommend it to others - love having it - good job
5,Beautiful and Inspiring,"One is a wonderful book about the idea that everything is happening at the same time and that there is only one whole with many different parallel realities.Fun to read, and food for thought."
3,Suspend Your logic,"Open your mind and heart. An excellent read if you are willing to suspend the belief systems you have aquired. Concepts that are seemingly ""far-fetched"" from a conventional persepective will become much easier to register from an ariel view. :)"
1,Too political,"After reading ""The Bridge Across Forever"" I wanted to read more from this couple. I was disappointed that this book was full of political propaganda. Yes it would be nice if everything was fairies and elves, but life just isn't like that. ""The Bridge Across Forever"" was a good book that I would recommend. I wouldn't recommend ""One"" to anyone."
4,interestng read,This is really an interesting book. It starts with Schoolcraft trying to expain the Indian mind set. But then he relates some winter tales that are very good.
1,Very Much Biased,"This book, though easy to read, is very much biased by the author's belief that modern Bibles are somehow perversions. His stance that the KJ is THE only Bible is clearly against God's Word. (See the fact that he produces not one scripture that says so)."
2,"Many words, little Essence","I am a new frog keeper, but yet, I know some things about frogs. I bought this book because I read the previous customer comments about this book. This book says about almost anything but it doesn't bother to explain how things work. For example, while I was needed to know the use of a heat mat, the book didn't say how you must use it. I'm also still concerned about the top of a terrarium (must it be a closed one or not?) How exactly I use vitamins with food? It contains many information but only as Titles and a few comments! (well, not bad for the money)"
3,Good cast. Bad directing.,"""El Padrino"" is a familiar gangster story. We've seen most of it before. Its main asset is a good cast, including Stacy Keach, Faye Dunaway, and Brad Dourif and Gary Busey in minor roles. The biggest problem is the direction. Star Damian Chapa directed the movie himself, and unfortunately he didn't do a good job directing. They should have hired a real director. The action sequences are especially weak, and bad editing doesn't help either.This is a 2,5 star movie. Since I can't give half stars I give it 3 stars for the good performances."
3,A should have been classic,"Overall its a pretty good movie with one exception the lead actor who you have to follow around for the entire movie. I would have given the movie five stars if only he wasn't in it. He is unable to capture any of the characters requirments, be it evil, happy, lusty, its always the same tone and it never changes. Why couldn't they have cast someone else in the part?Jennifer Tilly does an outstanding job, she'll make your skin crawl many times durring the film. Gary Busey is equally frightening in his demented role.Violent, intense, but not too gory. It would be an all time classic again if only the lead had been recast with anyone else, even a reality tv star would have been better. Its really hard to care about a character who is portrayed so badly."
1,North Carolina filers - don't use this product!,"I used H&R Block's online filing to generate and e-file my Federal and North Carolina return. There is an error in the NC return. No Declarations Control Number is generated for or printed on form NC-8453, which must be mailed to the State. H&R Block's tech support was no help, and they refused to refund my money. If their online product has this bug, I expect the purchased software does too. North Carolina filers - beware!!!"
3,Will not import TurboTax file,"I thought I'd try TaxCut since TurboTax decided to cripple their software this year. I can't say they compare well so far. First off TaxCut claims you can import TurboTax files from the prior year. I have tried every possible combination and filed a report to TaxCut support and have been unable to resolve the problem. To TaxCuts credit I submitted the problem on their web page and was called at my home the very next day by support. I doubt TurboTax would do the same. The program looks for old *.t01 files regardless of whether or not you select to import TaxCut or TurboTax files. So I thought maybe I'd do it manually. If you quit the program and save, it starts back up at the section of questions you left at, not at exactly where you left off like TurboTax. So you need to scroll forward to get to where you left off.It seems like a competent tax program but after being used to TurboTax I may take advantage of TaxCut's 100% money-back guarantee and get TurboTax again."
1,poor program,I tried to save a couple bucks using this junk (instead of TurboTax) and I regret it. The program is not close to the quality of TurboTax and is a total pain in the rear to use on the Mac family of computers.
4,4 stars just for not having TurboTax's awful activation,"As a previous TurboTax user I am trying out TaxCut this year. Sorry, this is not a review but a request that if previous TurboTax users are writing a review here please include in your review if you were able to import your TurboTax files.Thanks"
1,Slow & buggy!,"I purchased this based on some reviews I had read about Turbo Tax. When I first loaded this program I was happy because it could use my Turbo Tax return. However, when I tried to update State & Federal it crashed 8 times before I finally got the upgrades! And I'm using a Broadband connection, not dial-up. When I tried to download my W-2, it crashed every time. I ended up just using my paper copy. When I went to do my State return, my return was incorrect because I lived part time in one state and part time in another and for some reason it could not figure that out and my State return was constantly completed with my total Federal numbers. Next year I'm going back to Turbo Tax. If you haven't bought this product yet, DON'T. Go buy Turbo Tax instead - you'll be happy you did."
1,2002 Tax Cut,I have no idea how this program works. It will not download. Went back and it said it had downloaded and would not let me try again.
3,Good but not Great,"I bought this after seeing the Turbotax reviews after having used Turbotax the last 3 years. Taxcut is not as nice an interface but did the job. I imported last years Turbotax files without issue so I'm not sure what everyone else complaints revolve around this situation. Downloading the updates through the software kept locking up as said in other reviews, but the Taxcut web site has a seperate download that worked and installed easily into the existing installation of Taxcut. I would recommend it as efficient software and will probably use it next year."
1,It's April 13th and the program can't complete my taxes,"I just got off the phone with tech supportPlease start your taxes again! The file you have worked on for 40+ hours is corrupt!Well not completely corrupt as it passes all of the checks, itit prints. It just won't allow the state program to work.Once you install the state program it will have runtime errors and corrupt the program.This program is poorly written trash."
3,A TurboTax refugee,"I abandoned TurboTax because of all the annoying SPY & activation issues people have already written about, but I have used it for about 7 years before that.As expected TaxCut does not have as many good features. The itemization of imported items (at least from Quicken) is inferior. A lot of the linking and printing features are slightly inferior. I don't miss the lack of video clips etc.For me freedom from big brother and the future hassles that might cause were worth the step down in features."
2,If time and money are more important to you,"After reading the negative reviews about TurboTax on Amazon, I decided to purchase TaxCut this year. It installed ok, but the interview questions were not easy to understand and the ""Help"" was not helpful either. After spending many hours entering my data, my return was full of errors.I decided to go back to TurboTax. It took me less time to enter the data and also found deductions (such as CA vehicle registration VLF) that were not part of the TaxCut interview.If time and money are more important to you than activation scheme and spyware, I would recommend TurboTax."
