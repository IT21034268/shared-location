1,adolescent slag,"Just finished Plum Island, which I bought (cheap) when I thought I maybe had West Nile Virus some weeks ago, and Lab 257 at Plum Island is quite possibly where that disease came from (in the US anyway; seeLab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Germ Laboratory. However, the germ lab is one gigantic MacGuffin, its actual work playing at best a marginal role in this novel. Plus, the main character is a boorish and boring macho pig who tells jokes like: Q: What's the difference between a woman and a computer? A: A woman won't accept a three-and-a-half inch floppy. At best, a thorough waste of time."
1,Gave up on it.,"I have a rule when I read a book, if the first 100 pages don't grab me I throw in the towel. This was my first reading of a Nelson Demille book. I must say I was disappointed. I did not like his style of writing at all. He seems to try to hard to be hip. The story was slow going and I finally surrendered and started another book."
3,Just okay,I really couldn't get into the book. Took me a long time to read it. Glad when I finished. It was hard to follow.
3,fun twists,"I enjoyed about 2/3rds of this book. Then the author got a bit crazy. As soon as the forecast of 'hurricane' was mentioned I knew what was coming and so it did. Too bad. I could have done with fewer references to the main character's penis under its many pseudonyms, but it was marketed as a 'man's book'."
5,plum Island,Love the humor and excitement of John Corey. Didn't want to put it down. I felt like I was a part of the community.
4,Why did the book change direction half way through?,"Having a scientific background and education, I was excited when DeMille's recent novel began as a potential biological-disaster-thriller. His good characters early in the book (eg: two FBI agents with hidden agendas and conflict potential) fizzled into nothing when halfway through the book the plot did a U-turn and new characters took their place. The book seemed as if it would take off on a grand scale with John Corey holding the pieces to a puzzle that could save a city or the country but turned into only a one-on-one conflict. John Corey is a realisitc character, with the dry wit everyone wishes they had when confronting telemarketers. He drives the reader to want to see more of the world through his eyes, for which I applaud DeMille. Overall, a good thriller. Read it for the mystery and for John Corey's wit, not the surrounding plot."
5,"Top of my list, exciting and well researched","This book brought me back to Long Island where I am from. Great characters and plot. This book had heros, villains, evil scientists, suspense, even pirates! I loved it."
1,A pretty bad read.,"I wish I has read the one and two star reviews listed here previously. I found them infinitely more entertaining than the book, and maybe I could have saved myself a few bucks.Contrived and predictable characters, s-l-ow to no pace, and an embarrassing B-movie ending (beer-guzzling and wise-cracking while being shot at on a boat in a hurricane with a bleeding colleague? Puh-leeze!) made this book a turkey!I'll have to take the word of Mr. Demille's faithful readers that he has writtten books of some merit. Unfortunately, this was my first encounter with this author and I don't intend to repeat the experience."
2,Disappointing,"After reading some of Mr. Demille's previous books, like The General's Daughter, Catherdral, and The Charm School, I found this book to be very disappointing. The premise and storyline were fine. His main character was over done. I grew tired of his sophmoric sense of humor. It spoiled the story for me. I think he was trying to imitate the main character from ""The General's Daughter"", a much better book and character..."
2,couldn't finish,"I liked the sarcasm and wit of the main character, but for heavens sake, I want a thriller to move along at a brisker pace. I lost interest 2/3 of the way through."
1,"Whatever, something like that, UGH!!!","I've never read one of this yahoos books until now, and believe me, I won't spend another dime on his drivel. I lost count how many times this guy wrote either ""whatever"" or ""something or other"" throughout the first 200 pages (I put it down after that, anyone want my copy?). This had the makings of a good read, but his disjointed writing style and first person narrative was too much to take. I, like most people, appreciate humor in one's writing. However, his attempt at humor seemed to be forced and a bit too frequent. It became harder and harder to turn a page with any enthusiasm. Save your money on this ""effort"" or whatever it's called (please note the irony)."
3,A bit better than average.,"Although the main character is a pompous, male chauvanist I thought the book was better than others I have recently read. The character's humor becomes old quickly and you sometimes wished he would shut up. Then suddenly one of his stupid jokes would make me laugh and I would continue reading on. The story takes an unexpected twist about midway through the story. Kind o' a neat idea but I think the story loses its fizz. The book could be half as long and still gotten the point across. DeMille is a fine writer and his style makes this book an easy but drawn-out read."
3,Good plot but writing style is annoying.,"I really liked the plot of this book. It was sufficiently complex and interesting. In reading it, I felt as if I learned something which I like. I also enjoyed the thrill ride the book gave. Demille always does a good job of writing page-turners. However, I did not like that the book was written in first person. First of all, I never like books written in first person. Secondly, and much worse, the character whose perspective the book was written from was incredibly annoying and this ruined the entire book for me. I would not recommend it."
2,this book blew chunks,this book blew chunks. there were no redeeming qualities in it. it is painfully transparent that nelson demille projects his unfufilled personal goals into the main character in this lame story. it reeks of a writers mid-life crisis.
3,Not his best work.,"I started this book with high hopes, having readmany of his other books. I was disappointed that I had to read half the book before I was truly interested. The plot was good and the chase scene at the end was realistic."
4,good story but Corey is not that great a guy.,I liked the story but thought Cory was too much of a jock; he is a good detective though and his reasoning skills are spot on. I would have liked to known more about him beforehand. I doubt I'll buy another book by DeMille.
4,Plum Island and other De Mille books,"I have read this book, as I have all of Mr. De Milles books. I finished it in two sittings over a weekend. Very fast moving. Exiting. I left me with the feeling that I would like to meet the characters again in an additional book. Recommended."
3,"Fun, quick read...but a little long.","The book zipped a long, but I got bored with all the characters that had nothing to do with the plot.Towards the beginning of the book, there is a very long section (100 pages) describing a detailed tour of a facility on Plum Island, but it had little to do with the rest of the story and the parts that did could have been clipped to a few pages.But bring it to the beach, you won't be bored."
3,This is an okay book. I have definitely read better but I do not regret getting it.,I liked the mystery surrounding the characters but their story lines tended to be a little vague and the story line was a bit hard to follow at times. All in all it was not a bad book and I did like trying to figure out who the bad guy was. Turns out I chose the wrong one.
3,Slow and methodical but great ending,"DeMille does a great job of developing Corey and at times seems to go a bit too deep into some descriptions of other characters...can drag on at times. All that being said, the ending is great and a very intriguing story line."
3,Witty dialog.,"Enjoyed the snappy, witty dialog. Story line was good but dragged a bit. Certainly readable, but not DeMille's best work."
2,Tedious,I'm a big fan of Demille and was extremely disappointed in his latest book. I quit the book half way through (something I rarely do). I found the main character to be obnoxious and the story line tedious. I kept waiting for something to happen...it never did.
3,"Good Read, Bad Protagonist","I must credit Demille for having the courage to write a book featuring a totally unlikable protagonist.He starts out making this guy a cookie-cutter mystery novel cynical big city police detective (which I find in virtually every mystery novel involving big city police detectives), then goes on to make him one of the most despicable characters ever to claim to have the best interests of the public at heart.The single thing that rescues this book from being a parody of the genre is the story, which kept my attention well enough that I finished the book in one sitting."
2,Why does Nelson Demille hate women?,"I was so disappointed in Nelson Demille's latest offering, Plum Island. His hero seems to never think of women in any context but sexual and the red herrings the author throws at his readers are given way too much time and attention. The real culprit was not believable....I would have bought an international biological warfare coverup before I believed a crass little man. . . well, I don't want to give away the story.The way the narrator of the story views and handles women also leaves a lot to be desired. If he wasn't thinking with his zipper, he was working on a way to get his partner or a comely shopkeeper into his (or any handy) bed.I was very disappointed in Plum Island. I loved other Demille tales, but this one fell short in a myriad of ways"
4,Entertaining Summer Read!,"This is the first book by Nelson Demille that I have read. I really enjoyed it. It was a fast read, perfect for summer reading. I thought the characters were well developed and the plot, though predictable, was good. I guess I really enjoyed it because I lived on eastern Long Island and have seen Plum Island in the distance many times. Though I doubt that there is buried treasure on Plum Island, the fact that the government does testing of horrible diseases over there is not comforting.Try it, you will enjoy it. It was very entertaining"
4,Ouch!...It's not that bad!,"After reading Plum Island and after reading some of the scathing reveiws here, I felt I had to come to the defense of the book. Maybe not his best, but still worth it. The main charactor is just that, funny, rude, smart and human. The story goes in a direction that is not expected and somewhat ""off the wall"" but who wants predictability? There are sections that dragged a bit, but the book grabbed me from the start. I laughed out loud and looked forward to my evening time with the book."
4,My first Demille book - I'll read the rest,"I really enjoyed this book - interesting plot although a bit slow, some very funny moments like ""the trouble with doing nothing is you never know when you have finished!"" I will certainly give his other books a try - just bought Gold Coast."
4,Plum Island: A mystery told with a sense of humor!,I would highly recommend Plum Island to mystery lovers. Nelson Demille is hilariously funny as he describes his characters...though some women may find his humor offensive in that the main character is very sexist and quite horney throughout the novel. The story itself is interesting and provocative! If you're intrigued by pirate legend and government coverups...you'll enjoy this book!
4,The best book I've read all year (1998),"This book was absolutely riveting. I thought that DeMille spent a little too much detail on Plum Island itself, but otherwise, this was one of the more pleasent reads I've had in some time. I had never read a DeMille book before this one, but after this one, I picked up Spencerville right away. A definite must-read for any adventure loving readers."
3,Not Demille's best book,Plum Island is interesting in some ways and disappointing in others. I got really tired of the narrator's attempts at humor. He tried too hard and it did not ring true to me at all. Within hours of a personal tragedy he is wise-cracking. The same things happen at the story's very tense ending. Do people really crack jokes after tragic deaths and when they are in mortal danger? Maybe but it rang false to me. On the positive side the story has fascinating anecdotes about microbe research as well as pirate and buried treasure lore. All things considered don't make a special trip out to buy this book but if you don't have anything else to read it will wile away some time. But be forewarned that Mr. Demille has done much better work!
3,Entertaining,"I chose this book because I enjoy crime mysteries. I enjoyed the setting and circumstances (NE U.S., and weather).but I the main character was not appealing personally. I would recommend it to someone who enjoys fast reading."
3,So-So,"DeMille isn't Grisham but rates maybe 2nd place. Considering ordering the next in the John Corey series as soon as I finish some other books awaiting me on the kindle bookshelf. Hopefully by then the price will have gone down. I for one am most disappointed in the jump that the kindle books took in 2012 but that's another story. (You should pardon the pun!)Grisham's stories are smarter and do not include all the stupid swearing. We get it, DeMille! We don't have to read it or hear it!! Any idiot can swear.But considering the low price paid for the kindle version, it was a fairly good read."
2,Plum paste my taste,I am 85 and still living with Agatha Christie and her crowd. DeMille is oversexed and potty mouthed which to this geriatric reader spoils a reasonable interesting story. No doubt the younger generation will enjoy the book.
3,Too much childish sarcasm,"While I enjoyed the book and have read others in the Corey series, I am getting more than a little annoyed at the sarcasm of the main character. DeMIlle is simply trying too hard to inject inane comments from Corey. Let him be a serious, independent detective with a sarcastic streak rather than the opposite."
3,Great story.,"Very hard to get used to John Corey's, often out of place, wise cracks. I suppose an NYPD cop would use crude language and harbor a cynical attitude. Not my kind of hero, preferJack Reacher or Myron Boliter. Alternatiuvely I am enjoying ""The Leoperd:."
2,Wish I had heeded the negative reviews,"Although I finished reading this entire book, there were so many boring and irrelevant chapters I could have just as easily skipped them. The premise was a good one, and there were moments when one could empathise with the ""hero"" but his actions quickly ended all feelings of credibility.Read the other 1 and 2 star reviews- they are all accurate"
3,"If you like sarcasm and puns, you will love this book","There is lots of excitement, which is what you expect from Mr. DeMille but all the sarcasm and smart remarks gets really ""tiring"". A return of the bumbling Colombo, from days gone. The story is interesting but by the time it gets to the end it is getting really thin and you just wish he would get it done. It was was a good read but certainly not his best work"
2,Disappointing turn of storyline,"Started out the book expecting something exciting on the line of ""Virus vs. Earth"" and instead got an obnoxious ""Columbo does Treasure Island"". The comical remarks became tiring very quickly. I haven't tried any other Demille books and I'm wondering if I should."
3,Average Read for Nelson DeVille,"This is the 3rd book I've read by this author and it is good, but seems to be filled with ""excess"" information and many times just seems to be awfully ""wordy""! Also, the plot is somewhat predictable."
2,Nelson Demille wrote THIS book?,"I loved Charm School and The Gold Coast, so when I read the blurbs on the cover of Plum Island that this novel combined the best of both styles I was excited to start reading. What the heck happened to my Nelson Demille? It's hard to believe the same man wrote all three books. I kept waiting for Plum to ""kick in"" but it never did. In fact, it turned out to be extemely corny. I read a review that suggested that it was meant to be a parody. Who knows? A MAJOR disappointment.If you've never read Demille before don't start with this one. You'll might be so underwhelmed with ND that you might miss the EXCELLENT Charm School and Gold Coast."
2,If this is typical of DeMille's work...,"I began this book with great hopes, but was very disappointed. First of all, I found John Corey tedious, with his constant wise cracks and gods-gift-to-women behavior. I kept waiting for the ""mind twisting suspense"" to happen, but it never did. The story line was weak, with Corey deciding who the murderer was in the middle of the book, and then we just get to watch him act out his revenge, without any real proof or justification till almost the end. I guess we're just all expected to cheer for Corey, but he's so obnoxious and so vicious, that I found myself hoping he was wrong! Nothing is ""hair-raising"", except his sadistic behavoir towards the murderer. I seriously doubt that I'll waste money on any of DeMille's other books."
2,Could have been a great story.,How in the world could Demille move from the potential intrigue and excitement of biological terrorism to the ridiculous fantasy of pirate's treasure. This book could have been done in well under 200 pages. I was very disappointed with Demille's earlier works but thought I would give him another try. Never again.
1,A total waste of the reader's time,"After reading and thoroughly enjoying Demille's earlier works, I was completely turned off byPlum Island. The writing, characters and plotare juvenile at best, and a travesty at worst. Has what was once a talented writer turned trite and commercial like the now disappointing John Grisham? Demille's protagonist, an NYPD detective, is such an obnoxious, arrogant pain-in-the-neck that he discolors the entire story early on. I gave up on Demille and thestory by page 100 and have decided to donatethis bit of garbage to my local library withpity for any readers who may check it out inhopes of a good summer read. My recommendationis to leave Plum Island on the shelf and pick up ""The Perfect Storm"" instead."
2,Plum lsland,"I had read gold coast,which was wonderfully rich. Plum island was not. The protagonist, supporting characters, and the plot were never developed fully. The climax was far fetched."
3,Way too long for the amount of story,If I have hours and hours to fill would be a good read with all the details. Nice blend of mystery and coastal living but had lots of skip pages.
3,"Good Story, Sexist Protagonist","I had mixed feelings about this book. On one level, I enjoyed the science as well as the police procedural, and I really like the author's clean, brisk writing style. Unfortunately, I did not like the protagonist, John Corey. Far too sexist, and the references to women as little more than the sum of their body parts quickly got old. Which is too bad, because I think the author's intention was to create a crusty and sarcastic but lovable character. If his character respected women a little more, I would have liked him. But instead I spent far too much time eye rolling and being annoyed by his sexist quips.As for the story itself, it's a good one, but the last 100 pages could have easily been condensed to less than half that. Took too long to wrap things up, and at almost 700 pages (paperback), it went on for too long."
3,"i finished it, but...","High marks for verisimilitude but according to my sources on the North Shore, there are some implausibiliites concerning the sailing scenes to and from Plum Island itself. An old salt who has often sailed those waters says it simply cannot be done due to the tide flows. I mustsay it as a lot of characters -- but is that enough? It had lots of chases -- boats not cars, but who's counting? I wouldnt drive out of my way to buy this book, but I don't ever buy books anyway. Go to the Library for this one -- don't pay money for it. Fun, easy read."
4,"Funny, fast paced, soap opera, treasure island tale.","This book is not just for men! Although, you have to find crude, sex crazed male behavior funny. The book started out fast paced but bored me to tears for 200 pages till the climax at the end. General's daughter and The charm school were 5 star books, this is a 3.5 starer. It is more like an Law & Order episode than a Columbo episode. You know who the killer is far before the end. Overall a good book, just don't expect it to be a 'charm school'."
2,A first- and last-time DeMille reader,"Somehow this book ended up on my bookshelf, and as I was desperate for something to read on a trip, I gave it a go. The story itself was fairly interesting and well-done; in fact, it kept me reading (barely) despite my extreme dislike of the main character, John Corey. Corey's arrogance, chauvinism, and often inappropriate wisecracking was quite tiresome and even offensive on several occasions. The character himself admits to all these faults, but that does not make them any easier to bear nor does it excuse them. I also disliked much of Corey's behavior, and I was appalled by his treatment of the villain in the climax. Violence and other destructive acts certainly have their place in novels as integral elements of a story or character, but in this case I did not find Corey's behavior at all motivated or justified. Frankly, I find it disturbing that a character like this is seen as a ""hero""."
4,Plum good,"A very enjoyable murder mystery. John Cory at his sarcastic best. Very exciting with several twists and turns as the plot thickens. In some portions not very believable, but what the heck it's a novel."
3,Lots of Filler but No Meat,"This is my second DeMille book, the Lions Game was the first and did enjoy it. This book I did not enjoy as much. The John Corey character is a cross between Det. Axel Foley (Beverly Hills Cop)and Jake Gittens (Chinatown) but to an extreme and way way overdone. Corey actually become annoying as the book develops. I picked up the book since I have interest in Plum Island hoping for a biological/terrorist thriller, I got neither. I won't reveal the plot but after 650 pages or so it was very dissapointing, like big deal. The book is your typically who done it page turner and goes very fast (good thing). I doubt if I will read another DeMille book again."
5,A Return to the Wonderful,"After the somewhat disappointing Spencerville, I was thrilled to see DeMille return to the intrigue and suspense reminescent of The Charm School and The Talbot Odyssey. A classic ""whodunit,"" I was surprised by the true identity of the perp as well as the motivation behind the crime. Two thumbs up"
5,A fun read,"Great book for summer. Funny, entertaining, fast paced. Makes you want to grab a shovel and head out to Long Island. One of De Mille's most enjoyable, although The Charm School will always be my favorite"
5,What a hoot!,"Although parts of the plot were precicatable and somewhat unbelievable, nevertheless, Plum Island was still an enjoyable read. There was enough suspense and plot twists to keep the reader from getting bored with those aspects that were predicatable however, the best part of Plum Island is not so much the mystery and suspense as it is Nelson DeMille's sense of humor. I laughed out loud at many of his one-liners and if you don't read slowly enough you'll miss some hilarious innuendoes. If you're looking for a mystery story with some humor sprinkled in, you may be disappointed, but, if you're looking for a humorous story with some mystery on the side, you'll be thoroughly entertained"
2,Sizzles then Fizzles,"This is funny with good characters and no plot divergences. The story itself is interesting - but it follows the basic ""sizzle then fizzle"" formula. The last 100 pages are filled with too many murders and an overly long and ultimately boring boat chase."
3,It was OK,"This is the first in the series of the John Corey books by Nelson Demille. It was ok. I'm pretty easily entertained, but there were parts that just went on forever. The next three are much better!"
4,Well done,"Plum Island was an entertaining, enjoyable book - filled with subplots and multiple storylines that keep the reader engaged. The novel follows John Connor, a New York City police detective who is spending time on the north shore of Long Island recovering from wounds sustained on the job. He is pulled into the investigation of the double murder of a couple he was acquainted with. As the story unfolds, Corey must test his physical abilities and emotional ties to the case while using his intellect, inquisitiveness, and decisiveness to outwit the forces arrayed against him as he seeks to solve this crime. Told in the first person from Corey's perspective, DeMille provides a humorous (in a sarcastic, deadpan sort of way) character that has depth and likeability. Plum Island was worth my time."
3,Good Until the End,"I am a big Demille Fan. I think his characters, plots, and conversations are great. I have read all of his books and I love them all. Plum Island is great until the end. Like the Lion's Game, with its cop out ending, Plum Island is very exciting until the last few pages. At the end, its a very silly conventional chase. However, up until the last few pages its great. Is it worth the time, absolutely. You will read through it very fast. Demille's books are always fun to read. However the end is poor."
1,Not the best of Van,I was very disappointed with this cd -- the sound quality is poor and song renditions are not as rich as they are on other recordings. I have had the privilege of seeing Van Morrison live many times and I can barely listen to this cd! If you have been living on another planet and never heard Van Morrison before: don't buy this CD! It doesn't give a good representation of the truly incredible vocal abilities of Van Morrison.
1,Wake up Warner Bros. !!!!!,"I'm a huge fan of Van, especially his first two solos. As with James Taylor and Neal Young, WB continues to sit on these early classics without producing HDCD or DVD-Audio or even SACD remasters. Enough of this 'greatest hits' rehashing. Give us the real deal. I suggest not purchasing this in support of 'encouraging' WB to WAKE UP and get their act together. Nothing else seems to work."
2,decieving title,"this cd did'nt have the song I was looking for "" these are the days"" from the movie nine months so I wasted my money on a cd that I'll never play title of the cd implies it has songs from movie soundtrack"
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this cd. It sounded like he was being forced to sing Domino. Like he was bored to death. This was true of several songs on the cd.
2,Missing song,"The playlist says the song These Are The Days is track #8. I bought this CD specifically for this song as my mother, who passed away last November really liked it. I received the CD today and track #8 has Caravan not These Are The Days. I love Van Morrison's music and all the songs are excellent but I wanted that particular song and didn't receive it."
4,Great compiliation cd!,"This is a great ""hits"" collection of Van Morrison. Possibly, the best compiliation as far as a single disc out there, in my opinion. I deducted 1 star just due to the fact they didn't include ""crazy love"" as I have heard on numerous movies! Also, I would have preferred the studio version of ""into the mystic"". Overall though, it is still great of course."
4,Not As Good As One Would Think,"Van Morrison has been great (not just good) for 40 years. In a way, this CD is a Greatest Hits collection with live versions of a few songs replacing the original versions. In fact, each individual song is really first rate. However, the album as a whole seems a bit disjointed. Sometimes while listening, I would think about the original version of a song, and sometimes I would think about the songs surrounding the song on the original album. In other words, this CD is a collection of very fine individual songs, but (as with all first rate greatest hits albums) it will send you back to hear the songs in the context that they were first created."
5,Van Is The Man,"It seems that Van Morrison is an expensive artist. You are paying only for live recording songs, which are four songs, plus the great new recording of brown eyed girl, which is worth the price by it self, with the added song, days like this. The rest are repeats of his best valume one. If you are a van fan, you must get this, or life will pass you by.Hossam"
4,"Some live, some studio",Some of Van Morrison's songs on this album are live and some are studio made. I really don't much care for the live songs because I learned to like those songs made in the studio on vinyl. This is still a very good album.
4,Van Morrison Rocks!!,"We are enjoying this cd, with the wide variety of music there is something for everyone. Of course my favorites MOONDANCE, BROWN EYED GIRL,DAYS LIKE THIS, and GLORIA are the best.Pat"
3,For Completists and Newbies only,"The sound, of course, is wonderful. Great songs, too. But you don't need BOTH this and ""Best Of ... Volume 1"" unless you're a completist. Yes, this one *does* have ""Comfortably Numb,"" plus an unnecessary new version of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" and a few live versions of songs from ""Best Of ... Vol. 1"" But for being a supposed Academy Award inspired collection, why does this lack the ONLY Oscar-nominated song Van's done (""Sitting On Top Of The World"" from the film, ""Evelyn"")??? I'd blame a greedy record company for this CD, but as Van calls his own shots, let's say it represents a failure of imagination. Only 3 stars for a lack of creativity in this compilation ... but Van will -no doubt- laugh all the way to the bank."
3,Van is the man!,"I used to listen to some of Van Morrison's songs and think it was Mick Jagger on the vocals. Van has a good voice range and almost anything he sings is good listening. His cover of Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" is well done. I actually bought this CD for one of the songs which was in a movie. This is a good album."
3,Review of VM At The Movies,"An interesting alternative to a greatest hits CD consisting of lots of his well known hits, which happen to have been featured in movies, and some unexpected numbers such as Comfortably Numb. Fairly enjoyable but if you already have the greatest hits CDS you probably don't need this one unless you're a hardcore VM fan."
3,Error on the description,"Ordered this disc to get the song: These are the Days, which is supposed to be track 8 according to the description. The copy I got track 8 was Caravan and These Are the Days was not on it at all. Sent it back."
5,Absolutely awesome album,A great Van Morrison album for someone who really loves Van Morrison and his legendary sound. It's in my CD player all the time.
5,Good for the memory,Solgar is a reliable brand name. It may be a little more costly than certain brands but I guess you get what you pay for. Niacinamide has be found to enhance memory. It works for me.
2,Too small,We liked the look of this bag but would have liked to seen in in more detail on the site. Such as how the straps attached to the bag...were they sewen on or attached with plastic or metal fittings. Also it would have been useful to see what the inside of the bag looked like and to know the exact size of the bag. We were looking at using it as a school bag but it was far too small. When ordering from as far away as NZ it's important so that we don't have to incur the cost of return postage to get what we actually need. Not encouraging for future purchasings.CheersGillian
1,I Wish I Had Known,"The book lives up to its title in terms of being an introductory guide to programming, but what I didn't know was I had to have the specific program ""Visual Basic"" as well to get beyond chapter five. This revelation left the remaining 19 chapters of the book of no value to me at all. I do have ""Visual Basic.Net"", but it's way too much of a process to try to convert from one program to another and learn how they work at the same time."
1,Not a good guide at all....,This book dives into various programming languages which is helpful - but does not provide clear examples or suggest how you can write basic programs. Even using Visual Studio .Net I struggled to get the code in this book to generate a working program. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to write programs - there are much better books on the various languages. I was very disappointed by this book and have already retired it.
3,where do you get the software?,"this book is great for learning how to program...if you can get your hands on the software. Visual basic 6.0 working edition is the model for the majority of the text and the author offers no way to get it for free, which means you have to buy it seperately. I would suggest getting a book that has the programming languages you are going to use included on a cd."
3,Good Collection of Asimov's Work,"If you're a diehard Asimov fan like I am, you'll probably like this book. The main story, ""Gold,"" details a filmmaker realizing the second part of ...And the Gods Themselves. For that alone, it's worth a look.Asimov's more famous collections are a little more fun. If you're becoming an Asimov fan, it's best to start with his early science-fiction and then move through his career."
1,Forgettable,"Like one of the other reviewers, I didn't purchase this book for the short stories. None the less, I read them and two words come to mind: terrible and forgettable. Writers beware. Just because you can concoct some hair brained idea, doesn't mean that you should turn it into a SF story.I was interested in what Asimov had to say about SF and SF writing. Unfortunately, a disappointment here. Too much pontificating and in places, just poor writing. There is not much here that someone can glean on to that would make them a better SF writer. Don't buy this book; get it from your local library. I look forward to reading some of Asimov's early work some day; it has to be better than this one."
2,Not quite sure what the other reviewers read,"It doesn't seem like the other reviewers read the same book that I did. The book I read consisted of a lot of self-congratulatory essays on Asimov's creation of the Three Laws of Robotics (which aren't really laws, but that's a topic for a different rant) punctuated by a bunch of shaggy-dog stories (MAYBE they were funny in 1955) and a couple of lame science-fiction stories. I know Dr. Asimov was a brilliant man, but this book in no way offers him tribute to his genius. For fans only. Maybe."
1,Maybe something's changed...,"I bought this particular binder through NothingButSoftware here on Amazon because it looked like others I already have and specifically because there was a review here indicating this model did NOT have a handle.The ones I received did indeed have handles, but otherwise match the ones I'd bought previously. I suppose they're fine for what they are, but I'm disappointed -- not sure whether to be bummed that someone wrote an inaccurate review or that NothingButSoftware is pulling a fast one on me. But I'm bummed nonetheless.Go ahead and buy these if you like the faux-plether texture (I do), and specifically if you want ones with handles on the binder (I don't). I'll be returning these 2 shortly, or selling them on Pricegrabber Storefronts or something..."
1,Doesn't hold 208 CD's without breaking,"The plastic bolts that hold the pages into the book are easily broken. I don't even have the maximum 208 CD's in this binder and it is already broken. I don't even toss the binder around, I usually carry it inside of a bag to protect it."
4,Sylvia Browne Book of Angels,"As always, her work is very informative. A great read. Anyone interested in metaphysics will enjoy it. Easy to read and understand."
5,I believe in Angels,"To be fair I already believed in Angels before I purchased this book. I have even had an encounter with an Angel. I think this book gave me alot of practical information about who angels are and what they are around for. IMO this book gives everyone who reads it the confidence to live with more faith and with the knowledge that ANGELS are there to guide us, help us, and protect us. This book will be on my must save book shelf for the rest of my life. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about ANGELS."
4,Book of Angels by Sylvia Browne,Informative about a topic nebulous in concept and something I have wondered about for some time. Sylvia Browne's Book of Angels is an interesting read and I would recommend it to others curious about the topic.
2,Review of Angel book,"While reading this book I became angry because my son died and all I kept thinking wAs where we're the angels when he drowned......I know this is selfish and I am trying to understand how they might be helping my husband daughter, and myself now in our unending grief and pain."
2,angel book,"If you have never read any of Sylvia Browne's book, don't start with this one. There is a lot of material in this book that refers back to other books."
1,Sylvia writes from a very narrow viewpoint -,"showing a lack of extensive knowledge of the spiritual world. I was expecting to read something that would add to my knowledge but was very disappointed. Her strictly religious viewpoint causes her to see things as fitting into her already learned beliefs, thereby missing much of the 'bigger picture'. The angel stories were nice - much like those in any other publication about angels.I'm sorry I bought it and won't be buying any more of her books. Would that she were as enlightened as she thinks she is."
4,Pretty good.,"Most of the book is good, but she starts talking about some weird stuff that I don't particularly believe in."
4,Great,"No delays or any noticeable problems, just plugged into my modem and ran the line to my computer and a great product for the price."
5,The best album Jerry Rivera ever put out.,"This album is truly the best album Jerry Rivera ever released. If you are a Jerry Rivera fan and you do not have this album, you need to go get. It has all of his best hits, especially ""casi un hechizo""."
3,Not full leather,Not a full leather jacket just certain panels were. Was still good quality. Just not what I was looking for.
3,Over my head,"I don't know how many stars to give this book, but I had to give it something. I got it because the reviews were so good, but once I got it, I realized that I was in over my head . The names of recipes and ingredients sure sounded authentic. Maybe if there had been pictures, I would have been more inspired to give the recipes a shot. I ended up gifting the book to someone who I thought would appreciate it more than I did."
2,the book is mostly for an American Audience,"I was very excited to get the book but I don't live in the states, and we dont get a lot of Mexican food around. When the book arrived I realised that it is suitable only for the audience in US, most of the items they need for cooking are ready made, which are not available in South East Asia for example."
4,excellent reference,The book covers all the latest information on hydrodynamics of high speed craft. The book is a good reference work if you are seeking a good technical introduction into a specfic type of high-speed craft. Tho book also provides a good reference list of the most important technical papers in Western literture. Unfortunately some important Russian literature sources have not been added to the book.
1,Why pay for these lies,Norman Mailer suggests that the U.S. went to war with Iraq to boost the ego of white males in this book. How ridiculous!
4,could have been more,"First let me say that I absolutely love mailer's work. While it is true that he might be viewed as inaccessable, he's quite easy to understand if you've read his other works. One problem with this work is that I was kept wanting more. Thank you Mailer for a great timely work."
2,Why Are We At War?,"It is an important question that deserves more serious and thoughtful answers than have been provided by the administration, pundits and the media. Mailer complains that TV has destroyed our attention span, ability to learn, and to think clearly about issues - this books seems to be an example of that.Mailer offers no evidence, nothing that might constitute an arguement and rambles on a variety of unrelated topics. His explanation is no more cogent and defensible than the one coming from the White House that he opposes. Perhaps we will never know the answer to that question."
3,"Good on the Past of Microsoft, Nothing about the Future","Discusses Microsoft policies on hiring the very best people andtracks the evolution of two completely secondary products: Money andEncarta. Not a word is said about the server strategy and key technologies like multiteradata databases, clusters and transaction processing which everyone agrees are the pilars for the future of the company. As a matter of fact Windows NT does not even show anywhere in the book despite being the largest project undertaken by Microsoft. It describes well the corporate culture that pervades Microsoft's campus."
1,Brilliant Inside Look at the Best-Run Company in the World,"I just finished reading the book while vacationing in sunnyHonolulu and found the book fascinating and encouraging for allbusiness people wanting to emulate the genius of Bill Gates.This book should silence most of Bill Gate's critics sincethe author pointedly denounced their claims. The authoralso pointed out his initial objectiveness and his conclusionsin the Introduction. This was clever so as to not misleadanyone.I would highly recommend this first time in history, the insidelook of Microsoft."
2,Pass it up. There are less partial books available,"Stross was given access to Microsoft employees and resources while working on this book. He repays the favor by being the official Microsoft apologist. If Stross had some technical knowledge (rather than being a historian) he might have been capable of reaching some independent judgments. As it is, he merely parrots the Microsoft line at every point. He even repeats the ludicrous claim that Microsoft is not a monopoly. The two products Stross follows at length, Encarta and Money are not very important. If he had at least researched NT, there might have been one good reason to read this very one-sided book. Purchasers have the right to expect better from authors."
2,very biased view of Microsoft,"While there are some interesting insights to some of Microsoft's history, this book skips over vast territories of non-competitive behavior.There's nothing on how the Microsoft overcame their competitors in the application spaces (word processing, spread-sheet, presentations, etc). Instead the book spends most of it's time on how Microsoft cultivated the CDROM as a new medium.The author had access to Microsoft employees and lost his objectivity due to this. The first few chapters could have been written by Microsoft's PR department.The author's idea of Microsoft uniqueness: Microsoft tries to hire smart people. I'm sure there will be a Harvard MBA case study on companies which went out of their way to hire the mentally deficient and how that wasn't an effective strategy against Microsoft."
2,Justifying Bill Gates,"This Book's focus seemed to be more about justifying Bill Gates' actions, and defending Microsoft against negative PR than the actual history of Microsoft. A more fact-filled, play-by-play history of the rise of Microsoft would have been more interesting, I think."
3,It's an explosive book - if it is the truth...,"The book offers Lena Pepitone's personal account as Marilyn's seamstress and special confidante. Offers information on the last 6 years of her life, including her marriage to Arthur Miller, the making of Some Like It Hot, a notorious affair with Yves Montand,her addiction to sleeping pills and alcohol, and her early expieriences as a struggling actress. The book is shocking with specific details about Marilyn's lack of personal hygenine and love of nudity. It also suggests that Marilyn gave birth to a child, but gave it up for adoption? I liked the book for its specific details and experiences with the goddess. It's a shocker, but you will often find yourself wondering if Ms.Pepitone is telling the truth or embellishing the truth for money-making purposes.Check it out for yourself."
2,"Lena, what?","Marilyn Monroe Confidential: An Intimate Personal AccountI've read many books on Marilyn Monroe, and I loved this one written by her wardrobe maid and friend. I loved this book until the very end, when Lena speaks of Marilyn's visit by her half sister, Bernice. She states Marilyn was approached by her sister as if Marilyn had never heard of her. There are pictures and facts of the two sisters meeting first when Marilyn was married to her first husband. This total absence of their meeting is a big blow to the entire ""Confidential"" book for me. How can Lena not know the two sisters had met many years earlier if Marilyn had truly confided in Mrs. Pepitone?"
3,Overblown account of marilyn..,"This is certainly an interesting Book...painting marilyn as a neurotic,spoiled,champagne swilling slob...and also as a sweet, misunderstood and lonely woman.At it's worst this book recounts marilyn's Life (standard stuff) and claims that marilyn gave birth to a baby boy....at it's best it gives a clear picture of marilyn's marriage to Arthur Miller, her apparent lack of real friendships and a look at the reality of marilyn's day to day Life.There are also revealing glimpses of marilyn's thoughts about her career and herself.This would make a hell of a movie!!"
2,Hard to take seriously,"This is an interesting book indeed. Unfortunately I find most of what's written very hard to believe. The way Pepitone describes Monroe goes against almost everything else that has ever been written about her. The book paints her as a lazy, dumb, immature and half crazy child. I kept an open mind while reading it but when the author claimed that Monroe had a child in her early teens I took the rest of the book with a grain of salt. If you don't really care about how accurate the content is then go ahead and read it to get a good chuckle if nothing else. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
4,Wish I could get my hands on this book again!,"I was pretty young when I read this book but it left an impact on me. One that I wish I could come to terms with once I read this book again. I lent it to someone and never got it back. Once I saw that it was out of print, it didn't surprise me at all. It was a pretty outrageous look at the world's most beloved bombshell by none other than the person who took the most care of her. That is what I found to be the most provocative of all. That her own friend would write such personal stories. I found it to be insightful, if true."
1,very disappointed,"very disappointed as when we viewed this product to buy online it was shown with a cover. The book had no cover.Second reason was, in the book, phrases and sentences were highlighted and underlined heavily withblack biro. This was purchased for a gift and is not in any way suitable to give as a present. I know when you purchasesecond hand books they are not in perfect condition, but this is bad. I had this book myself in the 80's and it had a coverwith a very attractive picture of Marilyn Monroe which I adored. So overall I hate it. We buy a lot of books through the Amazon site and have been very pleased with all of them. I would very much like this replaced with what I ordered and I do notwant to pay an additional postage. Please let me know. Regards Ronda Smart"
3,My Review,"I thought this is book was pretty good but I find some things in the book hard to belive. This is the first book I have read about Marilyn Monroe so I can't compare to any other book. But just like in the t.v. movie ""Norma Jean and Marilyn"", I don't think everything that they say is true."
1,"Again, Foxworthy manages to destroy my faith in humanity.","I've never liked Foxworthy. His redneck jokes, his ""off the wall"" humor have never amused me. They're just stupid. Reading this book was the biggest waste of time I've had in a long time."
1,"no shirt, no shoes, no thanks","This book targets a specific audience, young and dull-witted. Take some common experiences, invoke a drawl or two to spice things up, serve up on some bathroom fixtures. The reader suffers through countless forgettable events ladled up with the author's special sauce...southern-style conceit. 98% corn pone. Save your money and rent a video, his stage humor works better."
1,it cured my nut cancer,"i used to have tsticular cancer and after rubbing my sore testies with jeffs book, i can eat and do all the other stuff 40 year olds can do"
3,aky braky funny,I loved every word letter page and line. If I didn't hurt my head last year I would read it again.
4,I really fun read,"As all of the good books I read...this one was read within two days. I don't know what it is about me and biographies of interesting people, but this is a good one. It's filled with real life stories we wouild all like to tell. Yes...he is famous...but this book makes you feel like you are along with him on his wild red-neck lifestyle. It will make you feel like you were with him during his wild escapades. I really would have loved to be there with his adventures. Some people may take offense, but if you enjoy fun at all costs..this is the book for you. Keep in mind. Don't read this if you are an ultra vegetarian. It's for real people that love adventure."
1,Him hurts it,I doesnt l1kes howe he makes mys peoples looks bad- he cant not make jokesese abouts me that live in teh 0ld carsan ate teh dog foud. I mate teh hat from tha old pie pans
4,The one I reach for...,"My favorite for quick, concise definitions. He gives examples from past readings which illustrate beautifully how the card may apply. He is upbeat and positive, feels like a coach one can call for advice rather than a mystic. I really like his take on reversed cards- the deck becomes a tool for self-enlightenment."
3,Disappointing,"This book was a disappointment to me. The reviews led me to expect something more compelling, but I struggled to finish it. I could feel some of the author's pain in watching her father's illness and anticipated loss of life, but the way in which she described her mother was so detached it felt devoid of any emotion, like she was watching a bad movie and describing it to us. The most bizarre goings-on in her parents' home were relayed to the reader with a level of remove that made me believe she had become numb to the whole scene. Overall, the book didn't engage me as a reader.One nitpick: An editor doing her fact checking should have found that Marquette, Michigan is on Lake Superior, not Lake Michigan."
3,The Things Between Us.,"I don't feel that anything about this book set it apart from similar books of the same genre. While I'm sure writing the book was a type of catharsis for the author, I couldn't/didn't connect on any meaningful level."
3,The Things Between Us: A Memoir,"This is an ""ok"" book, but doesn't really hold the interest of the reader.I really expected something totally different. The book review I read previous to purchasing this said this was a biography about a woman with an alcoholic mother. Most of the book is about this woman's relationship with her father with very little mention of her mother. Maybe I expected too much."
2,"I wanted to like this book, but....",".Montgomery's tale is quite touching, and parts of it are uplifting and captivating. However, overall the story drags on and on and on. There's no sense of pacing nor any overall narrative. Oftentimes it has the feel of a photo album randomly thrown together....you see some interesting snapshots but no overall theme.It would be interesting for Montgomery to write another tale 10 years from now, just to see how her realtionship with her soibilings endure. But I just can't recommend this one for now.."
2,Fragmented and Disappointing.,"I really hoped to enjoy this memoir, but was disappointed. Lee Montgomery is able to communicate her love and affection for her father and her devastation at his illness (cancer), but at no time do I feel a connection between Lee and other members of her family. The sibling connection is never made, the relationship with her teetotaling mother never appears......it just left me empty.I found it curious that Montgomery is an editor, because at many points in this book I read and then reread a passage, wondering if I was missing something? There was often no succinct point to an entire paragraph. She jumped all over the place, and left her readers disconnected."
4,saying good bye,"This woman was born and raised at the same time I was. I related to her lonliness created by her mothers alcoholism. She turned to the garden and working side by side with her father. She never got ""face to face"" answers, just observations she made as she again walked through her dad's illness with him, side by side. The lack of directness leaves women like her,(and me) wondering and trying to ""fill in the blanks"", I thought she did so without judgement, without bitterness, and without blame. I thought it was a great read."
5,The Things Between Us: A Memoir - A must read,"I'm normally not a fan of memoirs, but Lee Montgomery's novel is truly amazing. Her ability to engage the reader while offering honest insights into her life and that of her family, is powerful. Anyone experiencing death or dying of close friends or family will find support and insight. Those coping with cancer or alcholism in their family will also benefit from reading this book."
4,African Aesthetic,"A wonderful compliment to ""The Spirit of African Design."" Highlights the functional role of art in the African aesthetic."
2,So-so,"An interesting topic (I love my African mud cloths personally) but the execution isn't the greatest. And the style isn't very mainstream. I buy a lot of decorating books because I like to look at them and be inspired by them, but I doubt that this look will appeal to very many people."
4,"Fresh, lively ideas for creating beautiful living spaces","I love this book and have already re-done my bedroom and study ""African style"". I bought this with ""Spirit of African Design"" and together they have given me new ideas on how to use color, fabric and paint to create beautiful living spaces. I had gotten so bored with the standard decorating ideas, and this has opened a whole new world to me. I cannot wait to do more!"
3,Nice Book,"This was purchased as a gift and out of the three I bought, this was the least favorite. This is not to say it isn't a good book, just not as good as the others."
5,A Wonderful DVD for anyone to learn Tai Chi.,This DVD is an excellent resource for anyone to learnTai Chi. It is a terrific comprehensive explanationof: - how to move your hands and legs - how to improveyour body balance - how to execute each action. TheDVD gives a complete demo including front view andback view. It also explains each 24 forms in detailwith still images. The background music makes merelaxed and calm. I am glad to have such wonderful TaiChi DVD. I can learn the martial arts much faster andbetter than I thought by paying only 20 dollars. GreatDVD!!!
5,A great DVD To Learn Taichi,This is a great DVD for both beginner level as well advanced level. This video does an excellent job of presenting the 24 forms. Each form is demonstrated from different angles to help the student learn each form. I highly recommend this video.
5,What it is,It's an empty spray bottle that you fill with water. Does the job of keeping my slide moving when it gets dry.
1,"Unbelievable, this product is not compatible with other Buffalo wireless routers","Buyer beware--this product is not compatible with Buffalo's own Airstation MIMO wireless router-- this was experienced by me and also confirmed by their own technical support. Therefore, even if you have an all Buffalo network, you cannot use this product. This is a huge oversight by the company and speaks very poorly of their product planning."
4,Cool book.,"I really liked this one. The 33 1/3 series can be hit or miss but this is one I liked a lot. Had a lot of interesting info and insights into Young at the time, the album and the recording."
5,great action,"I love this movie and would purchase if on DVD (I don't even own a VCR anymore). If you have not seen it rent it at the local movie rental, you'll love it. Good acting, beliveble plot, plenty of action & a great ending. Wish it were on DVD"
4,Watch it!,"This must be one of the best kept secrets of the '90s. A brilliant film straight to video, what a waste.I cannot recall how many times I have watched my treasured video of this film but I know it never fails to entertain.I just want to add my voice to those pleading for a DVD release."
4,Why hasn't this movie been released on dvd in the US yet?,"This is a very enjoyable film, one of Patrick Dempsey's best from his earlier (pre-Grey's Anatomy) work. I wish that it were available in the US."
2,"Horrible range, worse interface, and no help from SMC","Alright, I picked this thing up off of ebay brand new. And I have to say it's been nothing but problems for me. Half the time I can't get any computer to connect to it and recognize it. Then for some inexplicible reason it will stop communicating with the network, requiring to to basically reinstall all the stuff on your computer, lug the printer and the server down to your computer and plug it all in and redo it from scratch. Now that doesn't even work on the thing. So I've got a paperweight. SMC's tech support is even worse, assuming you can understand anyone there, which I could barely do.All around I've found this product to be less then thrilling in its usefulness. I'm done with it and SMC. The worst slap in the face from this whole thing is that on my box is says limited lifetime warrenty. But somehow my server is out of warrenty? Yeah... I'm done with em and this. It's in the trash tomorrow."
4,A work in progress,"I purchased this kit for my 8 year old daughter a month or so ago. She has needed help in organizing her project and in some of the preparation for sewing, however the sewing and quilting itself is quite easy. The finished product promises to be attractive and useful, but for us is still a long way off."
2,Not good at all,This was my first book by this author and I wasn't very impressed. It was too simple. This book did not have many turning points or climaxes to keep me interested. Don't waste your money.
1,Misogynistic trash,"This was the first book I ever read by E. Lynn Harris, and it is clear to me that he hates women and promotes ""players"". The book was truly distasteful and unfortunate. This will be the last book I read from him."
2,Disappointed in this one.,"I usually enjoy Harris' novels, but I was very disappointed in this one. I felt like I was reading a sex novel. That, combined with the shallowness of the main female character, made this book especially hard to read."
1,Give me a break!!!!!,"I personally don't know how this book got such good reviews. It Sucked!!!! It took to long to get to the point. Maybe the last couple of chapters it got good, but this is the kind of book you read when you don't have anything else."
4,Not your typical E. Lynn Harris,"To avid readers this book is a bit breezy. Its a small book with few words printed on each page and a reading level of probably 8th grade. For people who do not read much or who just want an easy summer read then its perfect. It will leave the rest of us wanting a little more. The saving grace for this book is what has made Harris a best selling author---his character depictons. These characters are so real that you get caught up in their emotional rollercoasters. They're believable and may remind you of people you know. It was a creative little tale of romance, deception, sex and family issues. When the two main characters have to face their pasts head on, it reads like a high speed train wreck. Worth reading."
1,not his best but good,"I have been a huge fan of Mr. Harris since ""Just as I Am"" and I have read all of Mr Harris' novels. This book is good but not up to the potential Mr Harris is known for.I would recommend reading his earlier novels first then read this book.Mr Harris I still I admire you."
2,"CAPTIVATING, BUT CERTAIN LANGAUGE NOT NEEDED","This was the first book I have ""read"" by Mr. Harris. I will consider others, however I found the story entertaining, some of the language was offensive and too descriptive in a vulgar way. The reader of the audio book Rocky Carroll however was absolutely excellent and it was because of the reader that I did not stop the book after the first chapter."
3,Not A Day Goes By,"The book was in good condition. However, when I ordered the book it stated that it was a hardcover, but I received paperback. I did not want to pay the amount for a paperback. I should receive a discount or credit towards the purchase of something else."
3,Appropriate Title,"The title of this book ""Not A Day Goes By"" could not have been a better one. Because not a day will go by that I won't scratch my head and wonder what the hell went wrong with this book! While it was an overall entertaining read it is certainly not the E. Lynn that I was expecting. It was great that he brought back Basil, Yancy and Ava however, the Ava/Yancy story is dead and needs to be put to rest. This book left far too many loose ends and some of them definitely needed to be cut tied and burned!This book while certainly entertaining is not thought provoking like all the previous novels. This one is definitely a light read."
4,Entertaining,This book was very entertaining and a fast paced read. Definitely a page turner. I am new to E. Lynn Harris and so far I am pleased with what he had to offer.
5,Feelin' It,"Okay, I admit it, I bypassed E. Lynn's previous five books because of plain ol' fashioned ignorance (wasn't feeling the homosexual characters). Well guess what, after reading his new tome, ""Not A Day Goes By"" I'm eating crow bigtime. The brother has skills no doubt about it. The title aptly describes my reading experience--a day didn't go by from when I reluctantly picked it up and completed it (one pleasure filled sitting). The book is a must read for anyone interested in love and it's many obstacles and challenges. Unfortunately, I have to cut this review short. I have a bunch of catch up reading to do ... starting with this book I just picked up--Invisible Life."
5,excellent read,I think this book is by far the best E.Lynn Harris available. The characters were so engaging and thought provoking. I know several marriages that were called into question but went on anyway. This was a quick read and I was so sorry that it came to an end. Please ELH continue the story. There's alot left to say. That mother was a TRIP!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not a cliche goes by,"I enjoy Mr. Harris works and will go out of my way and budget to purchase his books. I found this one full of cliches and soap operatic. You knew what was going to happen to the characters at the beginning of the book, and the end was real weak. The male character didn't learn anything from his experience and the reader dosen't either. The female character whom we meet in the previous book was basically a throw away character and something for the male (Bi)character to play againgst as opposed to another stronger male character. Basil has been in all the books and needs to grow up soon. It hardly even dealt with The last books revelations and insights of Basil. It kind of threw itself out of series. Where were the journal writing group?Sometimes One does not need to know what cologone a person has on. It does not help the plot, it's already established the character's have throw away income. Overall It was something to read but not my favoraite in this series of books"
4,Whoa!,This was my first E. Lynn Harris book. His strength is in how nicely his books flow. The details and the storyline moves fast and makes for a good read. I will read more of his books. I think it's worth reading. His story of modern relationships and sexual confusion is ...like whoa! It's interesting...to say the least!
3,Just too much information.,"Let me start of by saying I thought the book itself was pretty good. It was just hard to read through the gay scenes. That was the ony reason why I didn't buy anymore from this series. If you're not squemish about reading explicit gay scenes then by all means get this book. If you are like me and would rather not read about gay scenes, then don't get this book."
4,Great Follow Up,"I haven't finished this one yet but it is good. I just wish the chapters were a little bit longer. This is definitely a must buy from Mr. Harris. I have read all of his works and I will continue to support his writing. I really dig how he molds his characters daily lives with the modern events in modern times that have occurred with in the last 5-10 years. ""Move on Black Man, Move on"" AND DON'T stop bringing us your great works of literature."
2,A Trashy Read,"Don't mistake this for anything but what it is -- a purely trashy read. All of the main characters spend the book lying to each other and practicing deceit. None of them are particularly likeable, and their dialogue and sex scenes are mawkish, but there's a cheap thrill in the jaw-dropping coldness with which they treat each other.It's a cute way to empty your head for a few hours before you read something more substantial."
4,Good,I did enjoy this book. This author continues to give us entertaining stories and I am looking forward to his next one.
3,not a day goes by,"I have to say that I was rather disappointed with this book. I waited months for it's release, and got a half-hearted effort at continuing a story that has been excellent until now. This book lacked the depth, passion, and excitement i've come to expect from Mr. Harris. The one bright spot came in the epilogue, when Mr. Harris let it be known that Basil the Dawg was back. I look foward to that story, and hope that I won't again be disappointed."
5,Not long enough,"E. Lynn Harris has done it again. My hat goes off to him for writing another wonderful story. This brother has some serious talent. Mr. Harris writes with such passion! My only regret is that the book was too short. John ""Basil"" Henderson is much too deep for such a short book. I hope this means that the next E. Lynn Harris novel will be out really soon....."
5,Just Great,"Mr. Harris has done a fine job writing this one as well. He was very in tune with the characters. He still showed us how self absorbed Yancey is. I liked the new Basil. I felt sorry that because of Yancey's selfishness, Basil reverted to his previous ways. I also liked that Harris brought back two previous characters (Zurich and Raymond) that would try to talk Basil into coming to grip with his past. Now, Ava (Yancey's mother) is still a trip. I hope there are no mothers out there who will treat their daughters the way she does Yancey. No wonder Yancey is self-centered. Ava really needs to be brought down a peg or two.Buy it and read it. Took me two days to finish it. This book is a winner and I would recommend it to my friends. It starts off with a kicker and then ends with a bang. I can't wait for Harris' next one."
4,"It won't win a nobel lit prize, but it's a fun ride!","I liked E. Lynn in my early twenties and haven't read a book of his since the first two came out. I wanted to check him out and see how he's grown as a writer (and how I've grown as a critical reader). This book was fun, and I couldn't put it down, but I do understand why critics are frustrated by the overwhelming amount of Black novels that read just the same way this one did, with a few too many overly dramatic metaphors, too much name dropping (especially with clothing designers), and unnecessarily bourgie details. Harris is very descriptive; almost too much so. There were moments when I was drawn out of the story by too-long lists of adjectives about simple things like the napkin a character was using to wipe her mouth. Overall, a fun read. Just go into it knowing it ain't that deep."
3,The others were better,"I rated this book by E. Lynn Harris as average. I did enjoy it but compared to the previous four, this one was okay. I love the way E. Lynn Harris inter-connects his characters with sequal like theme. I was glad when Basil's problem was exposed. His behavior made a lot of sense. I guess he will be on the prowl again hurting and destroying another life. He met his match with Miss Yancey. Miss Yancey is another story entirely. Her mother was the master manipulator. Basil's one desire, conquering Raymond Tyler, adds an unsettled edge to Basil."
4,Yancey had it coming!,I didn't know this new chapter was out until I saw it in the bookstore. I started reading it right there and finished before they kicked me out. I'm glad to see another side to Basil and that he handled Ava/Yancey with the slickness of a cat. I only wish the book was longer! I wanted to savor Yancey's disgust! Good work overallWaiting for your next one
2,It wasn't his best work.,"I got the book when I came out, and finsh it in one day. It was really good book. Still I'm not to happy with his work. I have read all of his books. The last two books were alright. Still it not his best work. Don't be to shocked if it doesn't move you as his great writing should."
5,Tigers Don't Change THeir Stripes,"Mr.Harris has done it again! This book is enjoyable. Though it is not as deep as the first two books. But, hey we are talking about the people we love to hate Yancy and Basil. These two selfish, mean,and lying twosome deserve each other. Neither has a redeeming quality between them. And let's not forget Yancy's mother! Even though these characters are worthless, I loved reading this story to see if they would recognize and seek help."
3,"eh,...its okay...",....i've read all his other books. but i think he got bored here. these were minior characters from previous books. if you haven't read invisible life or just as i am pick them up now!then read this only after you are a certfied fan like me.
4,Not a minute went by.,"E. Lynn Harris latest saga was a TRIP. When I started this book, I knew then I was not going to put it down till I finished. Every word kept me engrossed and entertained. His characters were out of this world, they were wild, wicked, loveable and deplorable at the same time. Ironically, being a woman,I related and emphatized more with the Basil, the male character than Yancey. I thought Basil was so real. He was brilliant, amazing, gorgeous and yet possessed all the human frailities. Yancey was a disgrace to us women, She really was a sad woman who has a lot to learn about love, life and what it truly means to be successful. I was pleased with the end because Basil deserved a lot better than Yancey, he deserved to find love in either lane. E. Lynn Harris is a master story teller, he has wit, grace, charm and most of all the ability to draw the reader into that world."
3,A Little Disappointed,I am a huge fan of Mr.Harris and was eagerly anticipating his new novel...well I was a little disappointed with the storyline! Basil and Yancey should not have been a couple they both have way too much emotional baggage to make a relationship let alone a marriage work. Basil and Yancey has alot of growing up to do their actions were predictable and mean spirited. I would have loved to see them comfort their demons and finally find love and a stable relationship. They both are long over due for some happiness and love. The book was full of cliches and did not flow like Mr. Harris other works. This one read more like a soap opera.
2,Disappointing,"I've always loved E.Lynn Harris' books, but this one failed to entertain me as they usually do. This book felt like a rush job; the characters were more like caricatures: soap opera-like and unbelivable, which is unusual for Mr.Harris as his characters are usually so life like. He relies too much on pop culture. There is an abundance of cliches. And I think Yancey and Basil's relationship should have been played out from the beginning. I can hardly believe Basil loves Yancey; just because he says so isn't enough. Show--don't tell--is the oldest writing tool in the book but it is the most effective. How did Basil make the transition from woman hating to woman loving? Well, this book in no way will deter me from reading E. Lynn's following books, because no one's perfect--he is allowed a few faults--and the previous books were so good that I shall keep the faith!"
5,good book,mr harris's book was good as the rest of his books are i love e.lynn harris but i do not condone homosexuality it's wrong and i don't think anyone should but the book was great.
1,Not a Day Goes by that I wish I did not read this book,"I thought this book was terrible, the reviews were so misinforming. I don't see any value in a book when the writer has to graphically describe the love making. I am sorry but I read quite a few books and of the books I have read lately this was the worst. It is true Danielle Steele and the other trash writers. Sincerely, Eileen Kratter"
5,Great book for a lazy day!,"I bought this book a long time ago because I read some great review about it, but didn't get around to reading it until this past week or so. I couldn't put it down! The characters are so well-written and the plot is fast moving to keep you interested. Plenty of relationship drama and suspense; definitely a page turner. Can't wait to read another novel from this author!"
5,Couldnt Put It Down,I read this book in only one day. It was just that good. I had to know what was going on with Basil since every book I've read so far by E Lynn Harris has Basil as a character in it. I recommend this book to everyone is it truely a great read. Mr Harris keep up the good work I cant wait untill I get my hands on the next one
4,Very enjoyable.,"I must say that Mr. Harris keeps his readers ""glued"" to his books. Avid reading fans will once again enjoy his work with, Not A Day Goes By. Not since his first novel, have I been pageturning one of his novel! Basil and Yancey hurrying to read the next chapter, page...words!Thanks for writing this one, Mr. Harris! -LC"
4,A Manual to Relationships,"All of his books are excellent, I went through the whole series in 2 weeks. His books are page turners and you will never want to put the book down. I recommend this book to anyone that is tired of reading the unrealistic love novel. You will definately lean something about a different world."
4,Something to hold you 'til the next one comes out,"I really enjoyed reading this novel! It *was* short and didn't involve an intricate a web of characters as Harris is know for, but it kept my attention. Besides the switching of point-of-view (Basil narrates, then Yancey, then it's third-person,) I had no major quips with the novel. I enjoyed the addition of Ava to the novel, and I hope to see her again, should Mr. Harris decide to continue to build on this series. As a good sign, both the two main characters did manage to gain my sympathy by the end of the novel. Windsor was a colorful addition in which the author displayed his superb characterization skills. Everything was totally believable, even though the public rarely gets in the inner working of a Black celeb's lives. A good, quick read!"
3,Quick Read!,"Another good book by E. Lynn Harris! Although I expected a little more, the book was truly a Harris page turner. Read it in 1 day! I was a little disappointed, because after reading the first page, you figured out what happened; I could have done without that. But in the end Yancey got burned. I hated to see a sistah hurt, but that's a chance you take when you fall in love with ""Basil"". We'll see what happens in the next one. I got a feeling we haven't seen the last of Basil, or Zurich..."
4,GUILTY PLEASURE,"If you're looking for a easy, quick ""summer read"" this is it. Harris continues his always entertaining trials in the lives of characters introduced in Invisible Life. This go around cocky, bisexual footballer Basil takes the lead engaged to the snotty, conniving wanna be diva Yancey ( from Abide With Me ). While some of the dialogue sounds cheesy and forced, you will get so absorbed with the characters and story, you won't want to put it down. And then when it's over Harris achieves his goal of making you want more."
5,E. Lynn Can Make it Down and Dirty...,"I've always enjoyed E. Lynn's books, but this one takes the cake (and the frosting, too!). The characters are ones you love to hate and some you would give a real beat-down if you met a person like them in real life.Keeping secrets do not always prove to be an easy feat for Basil. Mistreating people doesn't always pay off for Yancey or her mother. The story is told with such clarity, the reader will feel as if they're watching a movie instead of reading a novel.Well done, Mr. Harris. Well done."
4,"Good Story, Confusing End","This is my first E.Lynn Harris novel-length experience (I have read a short story by him). The storyline was excellent. The characters were interesting, though he did not spend as much time developing ""Basil"" as he did developing Yancey. He caught you at the beginning, so that you just had to know what happened at the end. Very clever! But in the end, I don't think the question was clearly answered. Why weren't we allowed in that journal! Over all, very good writing."
5,Not A Day Goes By,"This book was full of DIRT!! And Yancy was the star of this book. Also Yancy's mom (Ava) was dirty too. Ava was just as raw as her mother, and who do you think taught her that? That's right her mother. Her mother did not raise her but she still learned Ava's ropes. Nicole did not see the things that were happening to her. Yancy tore Nicole up. Yancy also did dirt to Basil, but Basil was smart enough to get her back and cancel the wedding on the wedding day.HA HA HA--Gotcha Yancy!!"
3,A little disappointing,"Like all of E.Lynn's fans, I too was anxiously awaiting the release of this book. I read it in three days and when I finished I thought--is this it? In my opinion, Yancey and Basil were too superficial to be used as main characters because they're too predictable. Halfway through the book I had a sense of what was going to happen and how it would end. I think what Zurich, Raymond and Windsor brought to the story is what fans had grown accustomed to in other stories by the author. Although this book didn't meet my expectations, I look forward to hearing more about Windsor, Ava and of course Basil."
1,Lines run together as prose. No interactive table of contents,"This Kindle edition is useless. The poems run together on the page like prose, which makes them almost impossible to read. There is no interactive table of contents, so that even if you could read the poems you'd have trouble finding the one you wanted. When will someone produce a worthwhile Kindle edition of Cowper?"
1,ode to a couch,"Cowper's The Task is hilarious. An ode to a couch! The John Gilpin poem, also in this book, is LOL stuff. J.Nelson"
1,God awful,Unwatchable. Literally tried to watch it and couldn't. Avoid at all costs. This movie is not worth seeing for any amount of money.
3,Extremely uneven film but still a thumbs-up,"One of the most uneven films I've ever seen. At its core it's a metaphor for growing up and dealing with growing old, and at times it succeeds marvelously at this. It uses vampire absurdity as a method of dealing with very grounded issues and it does this with charm and warmth.At the same time it's often sloppily edited to an amateurish degree.It is at times a much, much smarter movie than you'd expect. And it's very sincere, very much wears its heart on its sleeve in a way that very endearing.Then almost immediately thereafter it will get sloppy in a manner worthy of a first-year-film-student.I suppose what puts it over the mid-point of the thumb-o-meter into thumbs-up-land for me is that at the end, I cared about Goody and was glad to have been taken on her life's-journey with her."
1,Not a movie I'd watch again.,"I wanted to like this movie. When I watched the preview I thought I would. I don't want to give the movie away. Therefore, I will keep it generic. This movie was boring, predictable and all around dumb. It's like they made a movie only because Vampires are the it thing right now, but they didn't think about the plot. The movie tried to be humorous, with a couple of entertaining moments. Unfortunately, it just felt flat and its two hours I cannot get back. Therefore, if you are looking for an entertaining movie, this would not be it."
1,regret spending 5 bucks,had high hopes but it was almost unwatchable. The only good thing about the movie was .... well.... nothing. It's a shame becuase it had a good cast.
2,Strange....,"Vamps was an OK movie.., It was cute and corny... That's about as much as I could say for it."
3,An Oddly Small Film,"Amy Heckerling's ""Clueless"" is such a touchstone film that I went into ""Vamps"" with high hopes.It's a cute movie, with some funny moments. Alicia Silverstone shines in it. The characters are well written. The story, however, seems very small for the big screen. This seemed like something that could have been told in a TV episode, even. I kept waiting for something bigger to happen, and it just never did. The whole movie ended up feeling anticlimactic.Sigourney Weaver's performance was so silly and over the top, it was a true shame. She made a crappy villain of the piece.All in all, it was worth the price of renting it, but I won't bother seeing it again, nor will I add it to my permanent collection."
3,vamp stamp,"clever idea was used with nice humorperhaps, too formula, too cutebut, if you want to relax and let the dumb jokes hit youyou got yourself a couple of bloodsluters!"
1,I want my money back!,"Thousands of $2.00 movies on Amazon and I pay $7.00 for this trash! After struggling to get through the first 15 minutes, it was back to watching something even more stupid, like ""Swamp People""."
3,Wanted to Love it....,"Oh how much I WANTED to love this movie. First I love director Amy Heckerling's work usually....second Alicia Silverstone used to be a favorite of mine and she seemingly dropped off the planet besides her vegetarian and weird child rearing rants.....third I absolutely ADORE Krysten Ritter. So I went into this movie expecting a smart and funny ""chick flick"" sort of thing. It was NOT. It was boring, it was unintentionally bad in parts meant to be campy and I was just let down. Was expecting lots more. Granted I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but this just wasn't even fun. The cover is misleading, it makes it look like a cute little film. Blah, did not like."
5,Cute,"This is a good cute and relaxing movie. Sure, it's cheesy in some parts and no it doesn't require much thought but that can be a good thing. You can sit back with the family and relax your mind. The ending is very touching as well, I was surprised that it was better than I expected."
2,Disappointing,"We rented this because Krysten Ritter is hilarious and we love Clueless. Alicia Silverstone was disappointing, and the amazing supporting cast was largely wasted. The plot is also too erratic and often seems to want us to care about things it never really got us to. Long story short, not great."
2,Silly,"Found this movie silly, but probably because it is more appropriate for a young audience (in their teens or twenties)."
4,Cute,"Yes, it was a cute movie. The plot was... well ...decent for the genre. It was pretty funny. The ending was..."
3,What a disappointment!!,"When I saw the reviews on this movie I was excited because of the actors that are in it and well, what they showed in the review, it looked good! BUT OH MY WORD!! This was close to horrible up until about the last 30 minutes of the movie. Then it was tolerable with a little laughter. There are some parts that are funny and actually make you laugh out loud but overall, I would NOT recommend anyone wasting their money on it. If you can streamline it for a couple dollars, okay. But even then I would still warn you for disappointment."
3,Entertaining but not earth shattering,I would suggest watching this knowing it is fun but not great movie writing. Loved the actors - all great.
4,Fun and Light Vampire Flick,"I was presently surprised by this movie. It was just simple fun, not hysterically funny, but fun. There wasn't anything really new in this movie, the concepts have all been done in one way or the other before, but it was all put together nicely. For those vampire fans out there this one is in the vein of Innocent Blood, a less cheesy Sundown the Vampire in Retreat, My Best Friend is a Vampire, or Once Bitten."
5,"Stakes the vamp craze with great wit. Not clueless, but very clever.","This film has the satire for this vamp generation of movies that Young Frankenstein had for those certain classics. The actresses are great, and the appearances of stars-you-may-remember all make this a very fun movie. Very refreshing! The more you know about vampire mythology, the more you will enjoy the humor (a great Vlad the Impaler). A film that the ""clueless"" x-generation will enjoy."
2,VERY POOR ATTEMPT,"I expected a ""Clueless"" kinda funny film. What I got was a predictable poor attempt at moviemaking. With that cast this film should have been much better. Don’t waste your time on Vamps"
2,Cute,Simple entertainment and some times funny. I really should have rented this movie though rather than the purchase. But I liked it.
4,Good Movie,A very good movie with a lot of heart. Very funny and memorable. I recommend it for all. Good Movie.
3,"Funny, but a bit cheesy","I enjoyed this for the laugh, but it wasn't a great movie. I love the actresses and they did a really good job."
3,It was ok,It was an ok film....something nice to watch if you have some extra time on your hands and want something to do.
4,Bravo para Mayra Montero,"Si como yo, has leido otros libros de Mayra Montero, definitivamente ""Purpura Profundo"" va a captar tu atencion. Es una historia bastante realista y quizas hasta controversial para muchas personas. Mayra Montero narra con increible realismo y naturalidad la vida de el personaje principal, al punto de sentir que tu tambien lo conoces. Bravo por ella, que es una mujer que escribe lo que muchos no se atreven."
2,Very Small Bag,This bag is very small. The zipper does not have the ability to separate - making the bag much smaller. I returned the bag - very disappointed.
3,Most games geared for preschool to first grade,While the Grade level on the book states Grades K-2 much of thegames and activities in the book are geared more towards alphabet and letter learning.
1,Regretted Buying,I did not find one useful idea in this book. Its game pieces were small and needed a lot of preparing to make. I'm going to give mine away because there wasn't one thing I thought I may ever want to use.
2,not what it appears,"Although this book gives some good ideas for activities, it does only that. You have to come up with most of the patterns on your own. Not what we expected."
1,disappointing,The quality of the paper is not good enough. It's not fun to play with the pieces of unqualified paper.
3,Not what I thought,It's just a simple watch. It doesn't have light so in my spinning classes I can't see the monitor. It doesen't work well enough.
4,Polar heart rate monitor,"I really like the product but wish Amazon would have indicated the size of the transmitter band that goes around your chest. There are different sizes, but this information wasn't available when I ordered the watch. Overall, I've had no problems with the product."
4,good product,"Great monitor....just wish it had a light. Also, the chest strap if moved won't read your heart rate.....which if you are exercising and not paying complete attention to it..... will reset itself. That can be a pain if you are trying to keep accurate counts. I think that is just a downfall of a chest strap... not necessarily the monitor."
1,Polar F4 Women's Heart Rate Monitor - not working!,"Unfortunately I cannot say anything good about this monitor since it worked for me only once. When I tried to use the monitor the second day it would not pick up the signal from the chest belt, no matter how I tried to reposition or tighten it. Also, the initial set-up (of the watch settings) was a bit of a chore - I nearly chucked it out of the window a couple of times. I returned it for a refund . I haven't bought another one thus far - still doing research and looking for input on which one is worth an investment."
2,Disappointed over the durability of this watch,"The watch has worked, if only for a brief time, and is a wonderful tool for monitoring heartrate and calories. However, after less than a year, it only works 50% of the time and both button tops on the sides have come off, thereby making it difficult to use the watch for anything other than time. I'm currently looking for a similar watch, different brand, that has the Polar's same features."
4,polar F4 heart rate monitor,"I've only had this for a month but so far so good. I haven't had a problem at all.I was looking for a basic monitor that counts calories, time,and HR, this one has been great."
3,"Review of the publishing, not of the content","The content of this book seems excellent, but I am quite dissapointed with the actual book. The binding is poor. I was reading the book for less than 15 minutes before one of the pages fell out. Moreover, the printing is poor. The book features lots of images, mostly MRI. The priniting is of such low quality that these can hardly be seen. They are too dark and appear as black blotches."
5,a captions power at sea,if you want to know what its like to be in the navy this is a movie you will want to see. i know i was in the navy! the bedford incident is not only a gripping movie it is a real possibility this actually happened in the early sixties.
1,1st half great,"Great movie!! Horrible quality. first half of the movie was great, then it suddenly became nothing but jerky video and halting audio. Had to stop when it just kept getting worse. Quality was JUNK!!!!!"
2,a Widmark disappointment,"I love Richard Widmark as an actor, but in this film he was just plain awful, particularly in the interview scene with Sidney Poitier. Martin Balsam's character is either irrelevant or woefully underdeveloped; the obvious attempt to parallel his efforts to overcome his past with those of Widmark's Captain Finlander--an attempt, I assume, to highlight Finlander's hypocrisy--are shallow at best. Some films work in unrefined form, but a political thriller, particulalry of Cold War vintage, cannot pull it off, and this one doesn't."
4,A lot of tedium redeemed by an incredible ending,"The Bottom Line:The Bedford Incident seems like a film that is heading towards an obvious conclusion for its first 100 minutes or so, and it's often not very interesting while it takes its time heading there...but then the filmmakers pull out the stops with a conclusion far different than the one I was expecting which completely changes the nature of everything that came before it; it's certainly a flawed film, but in its final 5 minutes or so it becomes a surprisingly compelling one.3/4"
2,"Good movie, bad price","Don't get me wrong by my rating. This is an excellent film. However $24.95 is way too high a price to pay for this, especially considering there are no extras at all. What were they thinking? It should have been $9.95 retail, which I'm sure it eventually will be. So for now, be happy with your video copy. Or if you have a dvd recorder, just wait for it to show up on Turner Classics."
5,A well cast movie,"Very well done. Suspense, suprises, and a really good job of casting. The whole script is well written, but it is the quality acting that makes this movie worth purchasing. Wally Cox is excellent.. A good look at the military perspective."
3,What? A Navy vessel & no poker going on? Impossible.,"Wait. There's more. A good cold war era thriller. I had a hunch that the USS Bedford would come to grief but I really didn't know how much.Sidney Poitier & Martin Balsam are fine but this is Richard Widmark's movie. He plays the slightly mad cold warrior, Capt. Eric Finlander. He is the best CO in the Navy. But politically he's a loose cannon with an in your face attitude. He's been passed over for promotion.The Bedford is tracking a Soviet sub that has strayed into Greenland's territorial waters. Capt. Finlander is itching for a confrontation. The tension grows throughout ala Hitchcock or a good Twilight Zone episode. Then there is a mistake. Soon after that...nothing. Literally. Worth watching."
4,The Bedfor Incident,"Years ago the cold war was hot, not like today, but the war still exists. Many of us remember Cuba, and the Missle crisis. Even now today, some small minded individuals can light a fire, a fire that isn't necessary. This move, even a dated one, simplifies how ease nuclear evens could, and possibly gets out of control quickly. Today people don't want to think about the weapons, or even understand how horrific these devices truely are. It's a good movie to watch, and think. The nuclear weapons age is far from over."
5,Forbidden film,"I was a radio operator in the Navy aboard a minesweeper when this movie came out. There was a fleetwide teletype communication which came down from Navy command advising all Navy personnel to stay away from this movie. Being of a curious type then and now, myself and a few of my buddies had to get to the movie house as soon as possible to see what all the fuss was about. Since this was a ""cold war"" era movie I guess we could see what the Navy brass was so upset about. Richard Widmark, who believed so much in this story, used his own money to make the movie, since the subject matter was so touchy. The result was a well-scripted and acted high-tension thriller. Although in black and white, this is my memory of the Navy in the mid-sixties. Our life on the minesweeper was very similar to the characters in The Bedford Incident, mostly boring with occasional moments of drama. Our Captain, however, seemed pretty normal. Enjoy some great storytelling!"
5,Almost as good as the book,"The Bedford Incident was one of the half dozen or so finest adventure novels of the cold war era. Regrettably, this movie isn't quite as outstanding as the novel but, nevertheless, it is quite good. I can think of no one who could have played Captain Eric Finlander better than Richard Widmark -- one of my favorite actors. The rest of the cast is good and the movie is far better than most of the movies being made these days. Recommended."
1,FRAUD ALERT,"Instead of this as advertised I received a HP wired regular/straight keyboard that is at least 15 years old. The plug isn't even USB. It looks like it came from an electronics recycling place. When I contacted the seller they said sorry, ship it back at my expense without telling me how my cost will be refunded. The seller does not know what a call tag is. I am in process of returning and fear I will not be refunded and will lose even more money to return it."
3,Nice looking but clanky keyboard with a decent wireless mouse,The keyboard isn't that great. The Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 6000 v2 (69A-00001) is much better even though the keyboard looks the same and uses a similar mouse. Has a bunch of multimedia functions which is nice but overall the keyboard is clanky and noisy. It looks good with a nice hand rest and ergonomic layout but tradeoff is the keyboard is very big and thick. It doesn't have the quality feel of the 6000 series keyboard and it feels very plastic with the keys being clunky and clicky.The mouse is functional and works very good. It's pretty sensitive. It has a good shape and design and doesn't drain batteries. The mouse feels a little too plastic and not as sturdy as the 6000 mouse. Maybe a great buy 2-3 yaears ago but i would pass ont his now for some better keyboard and mouse packages. The 6000 series is light years much better
2,outdated and broken,"the product is outdated, there are nicer products for the same money out there. The mouse scroll wheel was hard to move, and I also received it with the keyboard not working and had to return it."
3,Great design; repeat problem,"As another reviewer mentioned, the keys sometimes stop repeating when you're holding them down. This is really annoying when playing a game or navigating with the arrow keys.The mouse is superb, though, and the other aspects of the keyboard are great. I would give it five stars if it weren't for the repeat problem."
2,"Mouse great, keyboard plagued with typing delays","Every couple of days the keyboard experiences problems while typing. I'll be able to type a few characters and then it won't register anymore keys for a few seconds. It's like the software is locked up. Then it goes away after a few minutes and everything is fine. So frustrating I'm going out to buy a new keyboard today. It's not a computer problem because I installed it on brand new dell laptop. There is also something else that is weird. The software says there is a week connection and it's been that way since day 1. New batteries, reciever right next to mouse and keyboard, etc. No luck."
3,"Works fine and all, but TOO DARNED NOISY!!","This works fine, but I have it in my bedroom where I stay up late to work while my wife is asleep. This is where it's a disaster....I don't see why laptop keyboards can be so quiet, yet this thing sounds like a typewriter when I'm typing. Can't use it at night...Sux... It's a shame because all the other functions work well."
4,"Fine for normal uses, would not recommend for power users","I bought my wife this desktop/mouse combo. She loves it, although I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to keep it.Pros:- Keyboard is ergonomic and just the right size, mouse has a nice shape and plenty of buttons- Bluetooth has so far worked flawlessly, even when I pair my phone to a hands-free device in the same roomCons:- Definite lag between what you do on the keyboard and mouse, and when it responds- Mouse pointer ""vibrates"" a tad. Very difficult to do precise movements with the mouse.I would not recommend this mouse for anyone who does lots of precision PowerPoint or Excel, or anything at all related to CAD or gaming that requires fast and accurate reactions. If you're not one of those people, then this is an excellently priced, fully functional combo. If you are, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,DIED AFTER 3.5 MONTHS!,"I bought this microwave because of its many great features, but after 3 1/2 months of gentle use in my kitchen it just died. I had seen another review for the Panasonic NN-T764SF that said their's died after 5 months. Is this the reason that Amazon has been selling these at such a discount and with promotional coupons during the past few months? It seems like Panasonic is simply unloading a whole bunch of poorly engineering microwaves. I had another Panasonic in the early years of microwave ovens (back in the 70's) and it lasted for literally 10 years. I really am disappointed and would like to not have to go through the hassle of shipping it back under warranty, etc. Beware of this problem! I gave it a rating of 2 stars because it was nice when it was working, but I don't really trust the product anymore!"
1,My Panasonic Microwave died after 1 year and 2 weeks,"After 1 year and 2 weeks of service, my Panasonic microwave died. When I try to start the microwave, it would come on and then shut down after 10 seconds. It appears that many of the Panasonic microwaves has this same problem. I had tried unplugging it for a hour to let the electronics reset without success. Since the warranty has run out and the cost of Panasonic repairs are outrageous, my only option is to scrap this microwave and buy another. Until Panasonic can resolve their manufacturing problem, I would not buy another Panasonic."
1,Do not buy!,"Like other reviewers, I would not recommend purchasing this microwave as it lasted for a much shorter period than what I was expecting: I purchased it in March 2005 and it died in September 2006. When it went, it simply stopped working-- the clock still works but the microwave function fails. Sad because I really liked this one's looks!"
1,Garbage!!! And wasn't even the cheapest when we first bought!,"Had to rig it to make it work! Very poor quality engineering!!! Door wasn't shutting all the way. Had to put braces on the inside because the sheet metal that holds the latch assembly got bent. Works fine for now, but wouldn't recommend for anyone to buy one."
2,It just died.,I thought Panasonic quality was better than this. The microwave just died. Clock is still working but nothing else. From the reviews it seems tobea common problem.
4,Shake N Go,My son has many of these Shake N Go vehicles and he spends hours with them. The variety provides continuous entertainment for him. Overall they are very durable and seem to last.
3,Confused as well,This is a confusing video and I'm in my 20's and fit. I really enjoy aerobics but this tape is very difficult to follow. Once I thought I'd have it they'd completely change it up again. Instead of simply building on the steps they keep changing them. It's a great idea but definitely not for me. I do like the bonus pilates part however.
2,Not for Intermed..only for beginners,"I am pretty fit and was looking for a new DVD to help me change up my cardio routine. You have to know a quite a few names of the dance steps, and the minute you get the step down, they move on to a another combination. I had a very hard time following it. And I didn't even feel like I worked out. Not one drop of sweat or moment of needing to catch my breath. Disappointed."
2,I was dissapointed,"I really like the instructor Michelle Dozois. She teaches in the 10-minute solution series. That's mainly why I bought this dvd. I was dissapointed with it. The only routine I like is Dance Party. Other than that I think the routines are so-so. Maybe it's just me. I am more athletic and don't really like dance style to get fit. For fun, I think it's great. I don't really recommend this if you are trying to get a good cardio workout."
3,"Interesting and fun moves, but I couldn't get my heart rate up","It's hard to rate this product, because the workout is fun, with dance moves that are interesting - lots of hip shaking and attitude. However, I just couldn't get my heart rate up enough to where I felt like I was getting a good workout.If you want to get a bikini body, it's going to take more than this video. There are more effective ways to burn calories and tone your body - even if you just jump on a treadmill on an incline.If you just want a VERY LIGHT workout so that you can stay active for 50 minutes, than this video will work."
1,Poor Video,"This video does not match the description given. The workout is broken into 5 segments. Each segment claims to be a different style of workout, set to tribel, jazz and other types of music, but they are all basically the same. There is only one type of music on the video - synthetic aerobic crap. If you are looking to find an exercise video with decent background music...this is not it.In addition,the women who lead the video appear stocky and have screechy voices. The moves are confusing and poorly planned."
4,good workout once you learn the routines,"This DVD offers a solid cardio workout, though I understand the frustration of many other viewers. Michelle Dozois offers user-friendly instruction, where Lisa Wheeler tends to just perform a movement and expect the viewer the catch on. The routines are learnable, so don't give up! The pilates segment afterward is a great idea, but Lisa moves from one position to the next so quickly that I don't expect you get much benefit. I'd award Michelle 5 stars, and and Lisa, 3."
3,You'll need more than this to get into a bikini,"I am an advanced kickboxer who works out at home. I bought this video because (a) I have already bought every kickboxing video on the market and (b) for some variety. This is very earnest and sincere and prettily done and the leaders are well known trainers. If you play it straight through and do all the dance routines, then do the short bonus pilates at the end, you will get a worthwhile one-hour intermediate workout. If you have never done a dance workout before, DONT do this one first. Go to Collage Video.com and get some beginning dance videos. While the choregraphy is simple and easy to pick up, it does use some dance steps (mambos, grapevines, etc.) assuming you know them, and in order to get that heartrate up, they don't spend a lot of time at a slow pace. So it's a good intermediate level workout."
1,Disappointed,"I've been working out at home w/ tapes/DVDs for almost 30 years, so I think by now I can grasp most choreography and routines relatively easily. Not with this one though. Not intuitive, lots of work to remember the steps with minimal rewards calorie-burning wise. Neither instructor was particularly engaging -- kind of frenetic. Weird, huge set that seemed neither a ""living room"" nor an outside environment. Basically, awkward, overly complicated, and left me feeling like I'd wasted an hour of valuable workout time. I really tried to like it ... it's in the Goodwill bag now."
3,Light Cardio,"I think this workout is great for days when I want light cardio (every once in a while). The workouts are cool because you can can pick the order. There is a five minute warm up and cool down and then 5 ten minute workouts to pick from. So you can pick the workouts and the order. The workouts are fun, and I enjoyed doing them. I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser and thought this DVD is light cardio. I wouldn't do this often or depend on it for my workouts because it's too easy. But for those days when I need a light day, this is good."
2,Too Dancy and hard to follow,I love the other Shape DVDs I have purchased but was not impressed with this one. The moves are very 'dancy' and don't provide a really challanging workout. Tracy was really hard to follow and the routines got old very fast. They also have a couple of 'extra' people just following along who look kind of silly.
1,"Unless you are a dancer, forget this video!","I bought this video hoping for a new fun workout, but unless you have a dance background you get lost following the fast paced moves. The back of the box says 'easy to follow dance-based segments', nothing easy about it. The instructors do not take their time to show the moves before jumping right into the combination of moves...a lot of foot action. Don't waste your money on this DVD! I'm going back to 'CRUNCH'."
2,Hard Dance Moves!,"Awful! Like other reviewers, you really need to watch this a few times before attempting to incorporate it into your workout routine. Unfortunately I didn't do that and was really frustrated. I made it through 1 segment before I gave up and tried a different workout video. I hate it when cardio moves are so complex that you can't follow along right away. The whole point is to motivate you to sweat off those calories. I just didn't find it easy to follow or motivating. I love some of the other Shape DVDs and I was really disappointed with this one."
2,An unfortunate dud from a great series,I love the Shape workouts but this one is a dud. Really stupid workouts because they are too intricate to follow on the first time around but they don't get your heartrate up. I was disappointed.
2,Okay video if you know the moves.,"I bought this DVD and was really dissappointed. Unless you have seen the video once or twice through before performing the movements, you're screwed. The instructors leave no time for you to learn and catch up in time. I was extremely frustrated within a short period of time, and their ""get crazy!!"" phrases got very old, very fast. This is my first video purchased with Shape, and it may very well be my last."
2,Cardio....really?,I am a 20-something woman who was looking for an intense cardio workout for someone who is out of shape but I completed all of the workouts on this DVD without breaking a sweat. There is no way I will sashay and kick-ball-change my way to a bikini body. This video is useless unless you are really a beginner at workouts or you are a bit older. I'm giving mine to my 60 year old mother.
3,Jarring and annoying aerobics-based workout,"I bought this to help get me back in shape - So I'm somewhat of a beginner level again, but I've run a marathon in the past and I was a college athlete, so I'm no stranger to working hard. I guess I'm just tired of this chronic dance cardio theory, because these moves are too jarring on my achilles tendonitis without being strenuous enough to make me feel like I'm getting a difficult workout. In other words - I think this aerobic-based dance cardio stuff just doesn't cut it for a good workout to make you sweat. She tries to mix up the moves and it's fast-paced, but her attitude is a little annoying. Amazingly, she doesn't have any dance rhythm even though you can tell she's a seasoned instructor and cues well. I'm disappointed in this tape, I'm not going to use it very much."
3,umm..,"I received this video from a friend who loves it a lot. I flailed around like an idiot and mostly ran in place to keep my heart rate up. And believe it or not, I have a dance backround of 20 years or so of taking classes. There are two different instructors, one is very good and explains things well, the other just kind of does the routine and you have to just mirror her without any guidence. I do like how you can pick your workout order. But this is not my most favorite video ever. It gets used maybe once a month."
3,Minnkota remote.,"The switch failed soon but an inexpensive replacement did the trick. After two summers of use, it's working fine. Don't know why the switch failed but it wasn't a big deal."
4,Beautiful ..,"If you are looking for great story line, forget about it , but if you want Beautiful ,sexy women , nude buy it you won't be disappointed.McAbe"
3,GOOD BUT NOT CIGAR,"As a remarke of SEX AND THE ZEN, the movie benefits with better image and improved special effects; but that is pretty much all.Sex scenes are more like comedy; never really erotic. The original was better in that area.In brief, it is interesting as a curiosity but how this movie outperform AVATAR in China is beyond belief."
1,DVD Purchase,I was not very disappointed with this DVD. I had no notion that this was XXX-rated. I did not finish watching this dvd because I found it offensive. I would not have purchased it if I had known about the contents. I contacted Amazon customer service and seller and the seller was relunctant to exchange to another dvd. I will not purchase from the seller again.
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,This has to be one of the stupidest and idiotic movie ever made. The only reason I gave it one star instead of zero is because of the beautiful naked women in the movie.
2,Stale And Recycled,"I'm not sure who wrote the original review, but I'm sure that they probably didn't have to pay for their copy! This is stale and recycled - if you want a pounding track that sounds like all of the other stock in your DJ bag, great - it's easy to blend..."
3,Overall impact & quality of stories not up to par.,"In Ms. Shayne's ""Twilight Vows,"" Donovan O'Roarke was a simple farmer who didn't know he was dying from the belladona antigen in his blood. Unwilling to see the life fade from this mortal, the vampire Dante transformed him on All Hallow's Eve. Two centuries later, Donovan returns to his native Ireland, to the castle left to him by Dante, and to the hometown that tried to destroy him. For there lives Rachel Sullivan--a woman from whose line holds an irrisistible allure to vampires, and who's lips has always delivered treachery.In Marilyn Tracy's ""Married By Dawn,"" Gavin Deveroux has been sent by The Council to silence Tara Michaels, who has threatened to reveal The Society's existence. Tara believes Gavin killed her beloved sister, and she's willing to do anything to get her revenge."
3,Disappointingly lacklustre.,"The two stories are really not interesting, much to my disappointment. I do not care for any characters in the two stories, and I like Maggie Shayne's story only a little better.Maybe it's the length constraint, which is a pity because there are so few vampire romances out there nowadays."
4,Worked Great,"For the price, this was a great deal. I used this equipment to fry up 3 turkeys on Superbowl Sunday and it came out great. Lots of elbow grease, but I got this pot looking brand new again. It was worth the purchase and will come in handy for future cookouts."
2,"It's pretty low grade, but thats all I need","If you just need something to cook some gruel in, this will do. Its bargain basement quality but I am not cooking something that people are going to eat...just a beer brew pot."
4,Great for Brewing Beer,"This is a great pot for brewing beer. Am able to do a 5 gallon boil with nothing close to a boilover, which was always a problem I had with previous pots. Being Aluminum it cooled down extremely quick when put in a bucket of ice and using my immersion chiller. My only complaint is the thermometer it comes with was not very accurate. I boiled water in it and it said the temperature of the water was only 190'F when it started boiling, but the temperature of boiling should be 212'F. So I would just suggest not to trust the thermometer and use a higher quality thermometer. But this pot was fantastic for my needs and I would highly recommend it to fellow homebrewers looking to get an affordable brew pot."
4,I bought it for brewing beer.,"This is a great stock pot- especially for the price. The pot came with ""Bayou Classics"" engraved on the side, but as far as I am concerned, that is OK!"
3,"It does the job, but get your own thermo....","Received this item and so far have fried three turkeys in it. This item was packaged well, serves it's purpose, yet I calibrated the thermometer after frying one turkey, and it's about 20 degrees off. Not a game-changer for me personally...after all, you get what you pay for and it's Chinese made. For the other two turkeys I purchased a more reliable thermometer. As other reviewers have mentioned, the aluminum staff that holds the bird in the upright position is easily bent and doesn't provide much support. I bought this same item years ago and the aluminum in the rod was much stronger...again, what do you expect these days when quality is no longer a concern?"
3,Suspect material,"I deep fried a turkey in it and the turkey came out great! However, the pan burnt up pretty good about half way up the material. i had the temperature set correctly but the material charred very easily in my opinion. The pot is intact but not as attractive because of the burnt appearance. I'll continue to use it though."
3,Not very heavy duty,Works good for the price but it is lightweight and is actually starting to bend where it sits on the burner. Only used it once so I don't know about durability.
3,Bayou Classic Review,"I am pleased with the timelyness of the delivery on this product. I was unpleased as to the quality. I received my pot with a few dents in it. The thickness of the pot is not very thick but the amount of items that you receive with the set is great. I would recommend this only if you are going to use it a few times a year, but not daily."
2,What is it???,"The description says commerical grade. But the owners manual clearly states on the front page""NOT FOR COMMERICAL USE"". I returned my pot. The aluminum material is very thin."
5,Great transaction,The item showed up as described and when promised. I actually got a chance to use it over the Thanksgiving holiday and loved it.
2,I didn't like it,"The arm band is too long for women, it didn't feet me ok and the orange canal is located in the wrong side"
2,waiting for it to break so I can replace,Very very tight. I am afraid my iPod will fly across the room when inserting it. There is no way to charge the iPod while its in the armband. To insert it I have to put the iPod in sideways and twist it after I squeezed it half way in. Due to this I have a bend mark in the clear plastic in front. It hasn't broken yet and it is very inexpensive and cheaply made. So if you want something to get you by until you find the perfect one go for it... but there are better ones out there.
1,Animal Abuse is NOT cozy,"After introducing and featuring in several paragraphs 'a noble and dignified dog', the author heartlessly included a grisly scene graphically detailing the brutal, senseless slaughter of that beloved family pet. At that point, I burned my copy of this book."
3,Easy and enjoyable read,"If you are looking for something quick and fun to read, this is a great choice. Mystery, romance, and action all in one. Looking forward to reading the next installment."
3,Not a cozy,"Okay, I read this and I didn't think it was either fun or cozy. Perhaps it was because I had a hard time actually _liking_ any of the characters.It was very well-written, but I certainly wouldn't compare it to Donna Andrews' writing. It's much more hardcore than that."
2,"Only Average, and Too Long","This mystery went on way too long, giving you way too much time to easily figure out who the culprit was. Very predictable, no character development, and I won't be revisiting this series."
3,"Not Quite Cozy, but Fun","Harder-edged than one might expect from a cozy mystery about a wedding planner,VEILED THREATS is nonetheless engrossing. Weddings are a stressful time, and Carnegie Kincaid is understandably flustered as a drunken bridesmaid makes a scene at the reception, then roars off in the bride's car, only to be killed in a crash moments later.Why this would be the fault of the wedding planner is hard to fathom, but this incident kicks off a series of disasters that brings her wedding planning business to the brink of extinction.Tenderly wistful one moment, sexually agressive the next, Carnegie Kincaid is hard to pin down and just a little bit careless with her heart. Some of her missteps are so obvious, one wants to shake the girl, but she's engaging enough to make us care, and the easy humor makes it well worth the read."
5,I'm hooked.,"I can't wait for the next book.If you like a strong female sleuth then you'll love Carnegie Kincaid. She brings wit and humor and a keen eye for social detail to the mystery genre. In a wealthy client's driveway, Carnegie observes ""a blood-and-silver Alfa Romeo that looked fast standing still. I had some nail polish that color once, but it kept me awake at night.""This woman is strong and stylish with an enthralling way of viewing the world and a supporting cast of vivid characters."
3,another aggravating heroine,"""Veiled Threats"" was an ok afternoon read, but not much more. Carnegie got on my nerves a bit. She seems full of self doubt and negative attitude most of the time, but her character isn't developed in a way that you empathise or sympathise with her. It didn't come across to me at all as a hilarious mystery a la Donna Andrews. The humor is limited to the fact that Carnegie calls her van ""Vanna"" and always seems to be getting spilled on or dirty somehow, leaving her at a disadvantage. The mystery plot isn't bad (though some motives aren't well explained) but I'd enjoy it more with less of the self doubt and insecurities Carnegie seems to be burdened with."
4,Considering it's a first book--it really should get 5 stars!,"I bought this thinking it would be a 'fun' cozy read. It is that and much more. Don't think that you will be able to put this one down until you've finished--you won't. The characters are well developed--and the plot has few holes. Even though it's pretty easy to spot the good/bad guys lurking under the surface, this is still a most enjoyable first book."
4,good referance,Often americans don't know too much about their history. Don't know much about history provides a good reference for people to learn about some important information about american history in an easty to understand manner. The book is straight forward being split up into different chapters based on theme and time period. There are questions like what is pay of bigs invasion and who is w. e. b. dubois. The answers are straight foreword and get to the point.
4,Excellent for the MSAT,If you are a teacher or student teacher studying for the MSAT. This book is an excellent study guide for some of the information.
2,Don't Waste Your Time on Don't Know Much Audio Version,"I don't know about the written book, but the audio cassette was lacking in details. The audio version probably should not have been abridged. The author glances over some very important topics in history. Trying to go from the 1600's to 1984 in 100 minutes (or so) is just ridiculous. I don't know any more now for listening to this tape or spending the money."
2,Don't Know Much About Accuracy,"I must agree with previous writers who DO know something about history--this book is superficial and often just plain wrong. I have done a good deal of research about John Brown, and was encouraged to find three books by the real expert on this subject--Stephen Oates-- listed in Davis's bibliography. He must not have read the books, however, as he simply repeats the old prejudices that Oates did so much to disprove. And his summary of why the South seceded gives the impression that it was all the North's fault! A little knowledge is a dangerous thing; beware of anyone who promises to simplify the complex."
2,Judgment colors everything,"I got very weary of hearing the author's judgments on virtually EVERYTHING in US history. It's more a review of his opinions about history than it is informative. Some of this is to be expected, but this was ridiculous. Very disappointing."
1,Make sure to consult an encyclopedia as you read this book,"One question:What good results from reading an ""interesting"" history book that confuses facts and opinions?One opinion:If you like historical opinion, buy a book by an author who writes historical fiction or acknowledges he is biased.One solution:The encyclopedia will help you separate established facts from Davis's opinions.Here are a few corrections for those who read this book.1. Washington did not nudge Henry Knox with the tip of his boot as he stepped into his boat to cross the Delaware. Knox did not travel in the same boat as George Washington. Knox was in charge of transporting the horses and artillery on the big ferry boats.2. Most of the men crossed the Delaware standing up. Big river ferries and freight boats (Durham boats) had few seats or none at all. If a man sat on the bottom of one of those boats in the winter he would have been sitting in ice water.I got these facts from ""Washington's Crossing,"" by David Hackett Fischer."
2,"Interesting, Although Clearly Not Objective","The author provides an interesting survey of American History up to and including the mid 1990s. He freely passes into and out of editorial mode, especially when it comes to the recent past. By the time I finished the book, there was very little question as to Mr. Davis' personal political views."
2,insults the intelligence,"this book is misleading in that it tells you every thing you already knew unless you failed eighth grade history. though it tells a more accurate history than most text books it still falls short of being impartial. i do not reccomend this book. the worst part is when discussing the american invasion of the phillipenes it mentions only the american casualties and not the 600,000 people who were killed by americans"
1,Don't know much about bias? Get this book!,"I have only gotten 50 pages into this book and already decided not to read anymore (don't want to waste my time)! I bought it because I wanted a good un-opinionated look at American History. The author would have us believe he giving an unbiased portrayal of history, when in fact, his opinion is the most frequent occurence in the book. He takes great liberty in defining not only the actions but the motives of historical figures(how would he know their motive)? He sets himself up as judge of any ambition as evil and twists facts with overblown adjectives setting a tone that is cynical and mocking toward common portrayals of historical events. I have never read a book where it was more apparent that objective fact was being redefined by the author's slant. Save your money!"
5,Required reading,Too many U.S. citizens are ill informed or not informed of our country's history. Purchase and read this book. Clearly written and extremely informative.
4,GOOD STUFF,"I liked this one but then again I appreciate all of the works by Kenneth C. Davis. This little gem highlights some folks in history that sometimes get overlooked, like Sequoyah, Nat Turner, Chief Joseph, Tecumseh, etc. and historical stuff like hula hoops, frisbees, saddle shoes, poodle skirts, hot rods, etc (we all remember these, right?). Davis takes a fun, interesting look at our history. We're read it together as a family, and enjoy finding out about obscure parts of history, and how the foundation of our country was developed, a la Constitution, the Revolutionary War, the Civil War period, and the huge losses during World War II. A good read for history and new knowledge."
5,It's the book that applies to any ages.,"it's a brief American history and has outlines for events that took place in the United States. Don't wanna read big, old thick referrence books? Try this. A very good referrence book...that means, you don't really have to look through the whole book; to find something particular, just go to the index, find a certain period..boom! there you go."
1,"Not history, but what the author wants you to believe","There ought to be a law against false reporting like this. The claimed premise of this book is that it reports the real truth about history, and the author's agenda is to affect the social attitudes of the reader. At best this is propaganda, seasoned with enough fact to lull the average gullible reader into accepting it. People believe what they want to believe, the facts notwithstanding, and in this case, it only interferes with our ability to control the bad aspects of our nature for our own betterment."
1,Disappointing,"I was hoping to get a nice factual primer on American History when I ordered this book. What I got was a writer projecting his political bias on as many topics as possible. I'm kind of a hybrid Rebuplican/Democrat so I'm far from a right winger. But the left wing slant of this book is obvious and obtrusive from the get go. If this guy wants to impose his political beliefs on others, he should try fiction because history is too important to become an interpretive exercise.I couldn't recommend this author less."
5,"Excellent book for anyone who just watched ""Liberty.""","Have you just watched the PBS' special, ""Liberty?"" Do you have a hakerin' to learn more about the Revolutionary War? Have you ever wished all the pertinent facts of American History could be boiled down to the basics? Ken Davis does an admirable job of using humor and relevant topics to make American history come alive and fascinating to his readers. As with his other books, Davis employs the FAQ (frequently asked questions) format throughout much of the book. A good resource for American History teachers and high schools students bound by law to take an American History course."
2,boring,"Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition. Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling. White men were all bad, indians were good. Women were brave. Conservatives are anti-semites. Republicans are bad and pro business. Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy. This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations."
2,Too Politically Correct,I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book. Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that. I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew. I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History. Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.
5,"Excellent introduction for an ""alien""","I listened to this during my commute and found it to be enthralling. It is a lot more than a dull chronology of significant events and really tries to explain the background and significance of each of the major characters in US history as well as their deeds.I was not brought up in the States, so really appreciated the degree of detail provided. Yes, it includes opinion - but there are always two sides to every story and I found this made the events seem more relevant. It also identifies key books from each era, some of which I will now try to read (or listen to).I would certainly recommend it to anyone ignorant of US history, but interested. It has piqued my interest in history and that alone speaks volumes."
2,It's ok.,"I enjoy a fresh presentation of the facts, when provided, but his left of center dogma gets tiresome. One reviewer stated that he backs up his positions with facts, but really he picks and chooses the ""facts"" presented and excluded. I suppose it's enough for those inclined to agree with him, and works if you don't take a second to think about the aspects of the topic that he chose to ignore or downplay, but for most, I believe it will be an irritant. He expends a good deal of time at the beginning telling us that he has been neutral, but even that ""explanation"" is loaded. If you take it for what it is worth, sifting the wheat from the chaff, it's ok."
2,Not What I was Looking For,This book asks questions and then answers the questions in short form. A good reference perhaps but not a book you can sit down & read cover to cover.
2,Undermined By Political Agenda,"Don't Know Much About History has a great gimmick: history is presented in short question/answer format that's easy to read and understand.It should be noted though that this is history from a far left perspective. The fact that it isn't marketed as such is deceptive. At times, this perspective is just another vantage on history and is worthwhile reading in a popular book. At other times the author's biases get in the way and the history presented is distorted or incorrect. The sections on The Great Depression, McCarthyism, Iran Contra, and the Clinton Scandals are not just colored with a view from the left, they are genuinely misleading.A more truthful general history can be found in: A History of the American People by Paul Johnson."
1,What He Knows About History is Wrong,"It's not what Mr. Davis DOESN'T know about History that makes this such a dangerous book for it's intended audience, it what he DOES know that just aint so. For example, he ""knows"" that Karl Marx was really on to something in making class struggle the driving force behind historical change. But that's just not true.He ""knows"" that the next most important things you can say about any historical figure are how they measure up to 21st century orthodoxies on questions of race and gender. This tells us something about Davis, but not much about the historical situations that he claims to be talking about.A quick way to verify these overall assertions is to pick a subject that he deals with that you already know something about and flip to the end of the section where he gives his ""must reads."" Even when he waffles a bit in the text (or more often hides behind another historian), his bias almost always shows up here."
2,It's a shame...,"I enjoy learning about history, so I was anxious to hunker down with this book hoping to learn a little more about the history of this great country. Like most people, when I read a history book, I expect a fact-based, reasonably unbiased account of the events. Unfortunately, this book is anything but that. The authors view is so obviously skewed to the left that he distorts the facts to ensure his biases are well represented.If you are like me and want an unbiased account of history, this is definitely not the book for you."
2,Decent history - but blatantly biased,"As someone who developed an interest in history in my 30's (and having paid no attention in high school and college history), I found this book to be a great place to gain an overview of American history.If the book had stuck to the facts, I would have given it 4 stars.Unfortunately, the author can't resist showing his strong liberal bias - to the point of making disparaging comments of those who may disagree with his interpretation of the facts. This became more and more evident as he moved into 20th century history.If you are fairly ignorant of American history (like me) and want a quick and interesting starting point to learn more, this is a good book to start with. Just be prepared for a sales pitch on liberalism."
4,Dont know much about History_Everything you needed to know..,"The book was very informative about those dark points in american history that you do not learn in school. However, I was upset by a remark made aboutthe Spanish and their impact on the colonization of America, since they were here before the British. It states that we would be eating tacos at bullfights.....Mr. Davis should have done more research before making that comment , and should have discovered that tacos are a Mexican fare. His ignorance is evident on this comment!"
1,Author Don't Know Much About History,"The most appropriate place for the title of this book should be right after the author's name. Imagine writing, for example, the history of World War II without ever mentioning the Japanese before say 1942 or the Germans before perhaps 1943. This is pretty much the approach of this author with regard to ""Indians"" and ""Whites."" Incredible. Not much redeemingly good about America in this incompetent tome. If you believe, with Actor Matt Damon(""Good Will Hunting"") that author Howard Zinn is indeed ""heavy"" and if you agree on all principles with Noam Chomsky, then this book is just right for you. If not, it is just another brick in the wall."
2,"an ok history book, but VERY biased","Ok, so I do consider myself a liberal person. But I also like to read facts in history books, not biased opinions of them. Unfortunaltely, this book is much more on the opinions side. Even though I agreed with many of the author's biases, it was still very annoying to feel that I am being fed someone's views instead of historical facts. If you don't agree with the author's views, this would be quite unpleasant.In terms of the general coverage of history, the book does an ok job, but has a hard time keeping a thread - there is a lot of jumping around which makes it hard to follow, especially in an audio format. Nontheless, you do get an ok overview of American history (or at least of the author's opinions of the events).In general, I would not recommend it unless you are desperate or just need a fast refresher and are willing to ignore all the opinionated pieces and tease out the facts."
1,Wish I read the reviews first,"Of course the author would emphasize different things than a standard history but his biases are evident. Kennedy assasination conspiracy theories! Come on, these were put to rest years ago. He does allow that there was strong evidence against Alger Hiss- now of course we have definitive proof from Russia. Although there is material of value in the book, I am afraid that if this was your primary exposure to US History you still wouldn't know much"
2,Dumb history,"I could only get through 2 disks of the audio version. Despite an occasional nugget of worthwhile information, this work is an insult to the moderately informed reader/listener."
4,Every Thing Is Biased,"I have not actualy read the whole book, rather my American History teacher uses it occasionally uses it in his lessons. However, reading the comments written about this, I would like to point out that you can't expect this book to be unbiased. You can't expect an encyclopedia, or a biography about George Washington, or even the Bible to be unbiased. If someone wrote it, it's biased. So for anyone claiming that this book is bad because it's biased, so are you."
3,HISTORY AS OP ED,"This book is okay as an ""easy-read"" refresher on dates and events, but Davis can't keep from helping the reader understand personalities and events from HIS lefty perspective. This was apparent as early as colonial times but by the time he gets to Ronald Reagan -- OY! If you can stomach all the interpretive BS, this is a useful and easy book. I'm sure Davis regrets publishing when he did, though -- leaving the reader hanging as to the finale of the ""Bubba"" years. Make sure if you let your young'uns read this you ""supervise"" lest they be fooled."
1,Political Correct History ?,"I read the book before reading the reviews. First mistake. As noted by several other reviewers, the book is laced hard factual errors. The author's liberal bias ... all business activity is bad, all organized labor activates are good. Couple this, with his invention of what motivated the minds of many history characters, make it all ludicrous. It is a sad commentary on our knowledge of history, when so many readers have rated this book highly. There are interesting tidbits throughout the book, but with so many absolute errors, I certainly will not be passing along any of these tidbits as fact."
1,"Not REAL history, but biased history","Just like a newspaper, this author decides to cover certain events in history AND from a certain perspective (far left). Those of us who have learned American history in an AP class, where we read papers on a particular topics from the several authors (several perspectives), have the ability to see the entire ""picture"". This author chooses the perspective and, in most cases, ignores the TRUTH asbout a certain event.This teacher gives Mr. Davis a D for this book."
3,"Good overview, but biased and editorial","Davis writes a good overview of American history, summarizing some of the key and decisive events of the past. While no substitute for a text book, Davis makes interesting subject areas which have put generations of high school history students to sleep. As augmentation to a prescribed course of study, or as a refresher for a HS/college graduate, this book is worth reading.A word of caution. This is not a 'bare facts' history. Davis' writing style is heavily laced with very liberal editorialism. Davis also tends to insert his own opinions as fact. Overall he seems to view American history through liberal hindsight, rarely hesitating to impose his own value judgements on historical events and decisions made by political, military and business leaders."
2,"Author - ""Don't Know Much About"" Being Unbiased or Objective","I was initially drawn-in and impressed with the research, content and style through the first half or so of this book. Then it rapidly fell apart into a vastly left-wing, Clintonesque, anti-Republican, biased and slanted view of US politics.As one example,the author devotes a disproportionate amount of time on the Watergate scandal yet quickly glosses over the events surrounding Clinton's impeachment and their impact . Significant achievemnents of Republican administrations ( e.g. foreign policy advancements, economic gains,tax reform, etc) are glarringly and conveniently omitted."
1,Just the facts please,"I had hoped to learn something and I suppose I did. I now know the author's oppinion on so many things, this is not history but a VERY long oppinion piece."
4,cotton candy is good...at times,"yeah, this is junk food, but let's not pretend it's anything else. you don't pick up a book like this with the real intention of ""getting to the bottom of the facts and the truth,"" and if you do, then you ""don't know much about choosing books."" i feel this author is too conservative for me...as i come at this from a more politically radical perspective, where i find he smoothes over the issues and gives silly little reasons for major happenings.but all that said, he's spun some good cotton candy, and i'm eating it...in moderation (but don't eat too much at once or you'll throw up!)."
4,Very Fun Read for History Buffs,"If your into history and feel you need a little refresher, this is not only the refresher but another course altogether. Really fun to read, the book is written in question and answer format. You'll learn some interesting things in here that may help you on the Trivial Pursuit board."
3,I guess I payed attention in History class.,"A nice overview of American History, but not the interesting tidbits I hoped for."
5,Don't Know Much About history by Davis,"very interesting snipits about history. Delves into areas I thought were a sure thing since the ""history"" books wrote about it. Think again."
2,CD was physically bad.,"The first CD, last two tracks were flawed. Just went to garbage. Too bad. The books seemed to be good. Just the CD was bad."
3,Informative but flawed,"This book is similar to those PEOPLE's ALMANACS (by Wallace and Wallechinsky) that appeared in the 1970-1980's; crisp, readable, and informative. Author Kenneth Davis provides an attractive question-and-answer format to over 100 major events in U.S. history. He starts with Christopher Columbus and the Native Americans, and keeps going thru George Washington, the Civil War, Great Depression, all the way to the disputed 2000 Election and terrorist attacks. Additionally, the book is of almost equal use to history buffs and those with only a modest (or miniscule) knowledge of the subject. But the author is a little too eager to attack the nation's faults, he misstates a couple facts, and he offers some debatable opinions - at times from the left, other times from the right, other times from neither. For these reasons you should read this book with a critical eye. Still, this very informtaive popular history is worth a look."
4,What color is your history?,"History is in the eye of the beholder, and Davis views it through the lens of a liberal. There is nothing wrong with that, except that he espouses to present an objective, unbiased view of our nation's past. Perhaps this is an impossible goal, but he should at least be congniscent of this.It is difficult to cover the entire nation's history in the span of a few hours, but the periods he chose to explore, and the viewpoints he chose to represent, will leave the the unskeptical reader leaning to the left.If you want an entertaining perspective on history, this certainly fits. But please don't use this as a substitute for real history books.I would strongl recommend _Don't Know Much About the Universe_ over this."
2,Don't Know Much About History,"Beware! This is an engaging book. If I didn't know much about American history, I would likely have found it an appealing survey. Unfortunately, Davis doesn't deliver when it comes to objectivity. He too often steps outside interpretation of facts/events to offer HIS opinions. I can't recommend a history book where the author chooses spin over respect for his reader's ability to form an opinion once given the facts and context.Unfortunately, this otherwise worthy book falls prey to its author's slant."
4,Don't know much about History,"I thought this book was excellent at taking a broad brush approach to American History. The details were just deep enough to keep you interested and informed without requiring 2 hours of your time for each topic. It would be an excellent overview for most people. I particularly enjoyed the revisiting of early colonial days and reminders of how the Indians were treated, how slavery evolved, and how the USA went back and forth with England, Spain and France."
5,One of my favorites.,"This book is one of my favorite history books. I reference it all the time, as it is a great way to start a research topic, though on some topics, it is comprehensive enough to be the sole resource. Its light style and Q&A approach to exploring US history is refreshing, and the author often uses contemporary parallels to help explain (or compare) events in US history."
2,The People's History Of The US and Why Do Men Have Nipples,"The ""Peoples History of the United States"" provided ground breaking debunking of ""accepted"" history of accepted historical texts used in schools. Even the establishment of the school system embraced it as a required second book to more ""codified"" American History books.""Don't Know Much About History"" rips off most of the previous book. And must annoyingly uses a format that reads like ""Why Do Men Have Nipples"". Short on substance and new historical research.If you want to know the truth of US history, the ""Peoples History Of The United States"" is a must read.If you are looking for beach reading, like ""Why Do Men Have Nipples"", the book ""Don't Know About History"" is light reading and you can add it to your bag when you do to the beach!"
2,More than Skewed,"I found it amusing that the author starts out by informing us that our historical sense is frequently skewed by misconceptions perpetuated by textbooks, pop culture, and simplistic classroom dogma which leaves out certain `less savory' moments in history. Well, his `text' most certainly doesn't do any better; it doesn't take much reading to conclude that Mr. Davis only included information that was in line with his knowledge of historical fac...whoops, I mean...in line with his biased opinions.That said, the book is well written and fun to read (hence the two stars), BUT, not a very good book if you're looking for a complete and accurate guide to American history."
4,Very entertaining,"Entertaining reading but his liberal bias shows through very clearly. His take on recent America politics, especially Nixon through Clinton, sounds like any NPR listener."
5,"My review is not from the ""biased"" Christian viewpoint!","Unlike the people who have reviewed this & hated it because the book does not promote the careful propaganda campaign that has been shoved down our throat as the ""true history"", especially since McCarthy in the latter part of the past century, this book sticks to the facts as shown by actual historical documents. I'm so sick of the rewritten garbage that has been passed down for the past few generations and found the book terribly refreshing. As a genealogist/historian who is constantly digging through original records and first-hand information of the past, I'm always astonished at how much I previously learned in school had been stinted from the truth. I'm very grateful to find something that's both accurate and entertaining!"
5,Conservatives BACK OFF!!,"I know that to to the conservative set if something is not totally ""super gung ho pro-american propaganda"" then it must be total crap, and that the author HAS TO BE some clown who is just making things up to make the right wing look bad... because he's obviously a criminal who has nothing better to do right?Well this book is very good and sheds a lot of light on otherwise ignored facts. Funny isn't it how the so called ""liberal"" media helps to sugar coat everything, and when someone finally dares scratch beneath the surface, the conservatives come out for their witch hunts."
2,another biased liberal view,"as is the case with many of the newer history books, this author is a bit biased in his politically correct view of history. it is a shame when kids take some of these commentaries as fact."
1,Liberal view of history. NO NEED TO READ.,This is the liberal view of history. (They never see anything good.)This is the whole book.We hurt the Indians.We hurt blacks.We hurt the Viet Cong.Conservatives are bad.
4,Clash by Night,"Odets' NYC-set love-triangle has florid, urban dialogue that doesn't sound quite right coming out of the film's relocated-to-Monterey characters, but uniformly good performances iron out that kink. Lang's direction is much better than Odets' play, from the documentary-like shots of fishing boats that open the flick, to the short, neat tracking shots in the cramped interiors. Also punctuated by powerful extreme close-ups: J. Carrol Naish egging Paul Douglas to violence with spiteful gossip and a tortured Robert Ryan advancing ever closer to the camera until the frameline bisects his face. Stanwyck's bitter monologues about the hopelessness of housewife life are scene-chew-rific, and it's fun seeing an early Monroe role as a spunky tomboy who doesn't yet talk like a breathy baby. 7/10"
4,Stanwyck and Ryan are great together,"""Clash By Night"" is a great fifties movie. Barbara Stanwyck said in an interview once that she felt this movie came closest to exemplifying the European adult approach to movies made by adults, for adults. She was right. While the storyline might not be exactly great, Stanwyck and Robert Ryan are tough as nails and play their roles to perfection. This movie is so representative of the fifties dramas, it's a joy to watch. Great lines, great photography, great sets, and, of course, great acting, especially by Miss Stanwyck. See it, and be impressed."
3,Crash by night !,"This drama started out very well with Barbara Stanwycks character returning home begrudgingly after several failed romances in New York among other cities, but turned into a soap opera with Robert Ryans character and I really lost interest.This movie is not all bad but not something I would be wanting to watch again any time soon !Great cast though with Stanwyck, Ryan, Paul Douglas and Marylin Monroe who has a great role and does a fantastic job. Really enjoyed her.This movie has been listed by some as noir, but I say it more of a simple drama !"
3,A very average soap opera; an unintended historical record.,"This is the story of a woman who marries one man then falls for another. Nothing new here, and there's a lot of shouting in the process.The best part about the movie has nothing to do with its plot, but rather with the setting. It was filmed in Monterey, California, during the heyday of Cannery Row. This makes it an interesting historical recond of a long gone era made famous by John Steinbeck. Opening scenes show the sardine canning process, from unloading the fishing boats to the final product. The whistle calling cannery worker Marilyn Monroe to the job was also depicted accurately. It is probably the best filmed record of this era that is available. Most of the buildings shown in the movie are long gone, but the houses where much of the action takes place are still standing at the south end of Cannery Row."
3,As Monterey Turns,"Despite the gorgeous location cinematography and the top-notch performances by the principle actors it cannot disguise the fact that this film is a potboiler that borders on mawkish soap opera. That would be OK but Warner Brothers included this film in it's second film noir collection and I think it hardly qualifies as noir. That said, see this film for the performances here by Barbara Stanwyck, Paul Douglas, and Robert Ryan who do their darndest to make this film more than it really is. Up and comer Keith Andes(Who?) takes his shirt off. Marilyn Monroe, essentially wasted here, does her requisite bikini scene."
3,Not quite enough....,"This book had some good information, however, it doesn't seem to really cover all scenarios......like the one where the individual is difficult to talk to and is not ready to admit to his addiction. It teaches you how to have a conversation with someone who is willing to have one. If your partner is unwilling to speak to you about it, it leaves you out in the cold as to what you should do next - even if just for yourself. It clearly states you should not leave, but doesn't tell you what you should do. I also was looking for some information that would help me determine if I am enabling the gambling, but that subject did not get covered either. It seems like a book that is better for a therapist or someone who already has some of the basic knowledge associated with this kind of addiction."
3,History uber character,"This novel was first published in 1971, but never reprinted, suggesting it was not an immense commercial success. Yet three decades later, complete with dramatic new cover (and price tag), it's back on the shelves! Are there no better new submissions coming in?Anyway, this is a tale of a Russian convoy and an escort captain with too many personal demons. The author was himself a veteran of the Arctic convoys, and he writes with an authority on the experience it would be very difficult to emulate. The descriptions bring the reader as close to an understanding that someone who wasn't there is likely to get.Inevitably the Human-interest side pales in comparison. It's mostly told in flashback, and the characters could do with a bit more depth. Mr Trew has a habit of letting German characters speak in their own language, and then providing a translation immediately afterwards, which I found a bit irritating after a while. Still, a fair amount of tension is generated."
4,as good as I'd hoped,I found this at a library resale shop and didn't know what to expect. I love Katie Fforde and Marian Keyes. V. Henry had a touch of both I thought. The characters were very likable and well developed. A great weekend read.
3,Very enjoyable,"This is second book I've read by Veronica Henry and it did not disappoint. It was an entertaining, easy-to-read-when-you-want-to-relax-book with likeable and not-so-likeable characters you can root for or against to your heart's content. What makes the book so enjoyable is that plot and characters are credible without being boring. The end of course is also very satisfactory with a little bit of ""surprise"" thrown in."
5,It is Essential,"This book contains everything you need to know for the care and well-being of your horse. Including feed, grooming, saddle, tack and stable. Understanding your horse's health and how to maintain it. A classic!"
3,Needs more instructions,"I purchased this item for my 9 year old daughter who loves creating fashion designs out of paper. This was the third item I have purchased for her and the first one to fail. The mean reason my daughter has spent very little time using it is because there are very few instructions to guide her. The set comes with white plastic plates that we have no idea what to use them for. It includes a tracing pad with nothing to trace. Some sample drawings and designs of a full model would be very useful. Overall, a well package product that has the potential to be a fun set for a creative young girl, but it needs some more thought and work."
1,Fashion Angels Fashion Designer studio set,"I just received this product, it is for my 6-1/2 year old niece for Christmas. Very disappointed, she loves to color and trace, there are not any instructions, there is nothing to trace, the examples of clothing they show to trace would be too small, to fit up to the drawn doll on paper. I spent $23.00 on this item and am too embarrassed to give it to her for Christmas, $23.00 would buy a lot of markers,tracing books, paper, or even paper dolls! One could make their own fashion studio! for a lot less, the only cool thing about this item is the binder it comes in, What a waste of money!!"
5,Great bucket!,"What a fabulous bucket this is! It is really thick and strong and is very well made. I am very impressed having searched this land for a decent bucket for ages! I wish it was bigger though, but I have a feeling that they do them in other sizes so I will keep a look out and let you know. I would definitely buy this again as it is just what I was looking for, well made, strong, comfortable to use and looks great, I couldn't ask for more!"
5,"Gift for friend, he's impressed",Purchased and given as a gift. The cane is much heavier than I anticipated which means it should last longer than I thought. Decent quality for the price.
1,Terrible Book!,"This book is truly awful. It is VERY poorly written. He jumps back and forth in time in a way that makes no sense and contradicts himself over and over. Makes you wonder about some of his ""facts"".Also it is clear that he wrote this book well before Diana died and then tacked on a small chapter at the end and gave it this misleading title just to cash in on the Diana phenomenon. Originally one of Charles' set, the first book N. Davies wrote about Diana was at the urging of ""senior palace officials"". What does this tell us?He is waspishly critical of her yet aims his book at the public who love her. Disgusting."
3,chain,"very nice, chain is a bit long, would like it shorter very preetu, nice accessory for dressing up & going out"
1,Cheap,"The clasp is cheap looking and doesn't work well. It just wouldn't stay on the sweater material, it kept slipping off. This is not worth the money!"
3,Tauiwi,"A very good history of NZ and early maori contact. But do not rely on this tome alone, as it is slightly one sided, on the maori view of issues, but in conjunction with ""Making Peoples"" by James Belich this work becomes a very useful resource."
5,Seems to work,"I add 2 tbsp faithfully every week. It seems to work. The smell isn't that bad when opening the doggie dooley lid...and we have no problems with flies or other insects. I do wish that the large container came with a scoop...it would have saved me the trouble of buying a cheap set of measuring spoons to use. Also, the seller was great. Had no problems whatsoever...and received my order promptly...plus the price was reasonable. I will definitely work with them again when the time comes to replenish my stock."
1,The most unethical suppliers,"I ordered the Power Of Now and paid for it extra to be expidited. What do you think I get' The Amazon people send it out 3 THREE WEEKS LATE naturally special delivery. I would have never of purchased from them if they were HONEST and said up front ""WE DO NOT HAVE IT IN STOCK"""
4,A Must Have For Tolle Fans,"This book is a great follow-up to either The Power Of Now or A New Earth. If you were moved by these books, Practicing the Power of Now will give you more specific suggestions to continue. If you didn't ""get"" one of Tolle's other books, don't waste your time with this one."
1,More of the same.,"The title of this book is misleading. I loved the Power of Now. I read the book and just finished listening to the 5 volume audio version. By its title, I thought ""Practicing the Power of Now"" would supplement the Power of Now, and include exercises and practices that would assist me in moving into the Now, finding the silent watcher, etc . . . In reality, the CD contained verbatim exerpts from the original ""Power of Now,"" and no new material."
5,Excellent daily guide.,"This book puts the information into a more easily understood form. That encouraged me to make use of and practice being in the ""now"" more readily. I have recommended this book to many friends whom were delighted to have a more clear and directly useable format"
3,Good for beginners on their spiritual journey,"I think this book is great if you are starting out on your spiritual journey, but I found that there wasn't a lot of material once we understood what NOW means. Don't get me wrong. It is a very essential aspect that needs to be understood and then tried to be lived. Tolle gives meditations and example of how to go about this and this is all helpful. But what I found most profound was Tolle's explanation of the pain body and particularly womens's historical pain body. So much truth in there, and really helps to understand how women have seen themselves as second class citizens for so long. Just for that part of the book it was worth the read.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
4,A Valuable tool to becoming your Authentic Self,Excellent guide to self discovery and inner peace.A great prerequisite to his other books.
2,Nothing New in This Book,"If you have read The Power of Now, you can skip this book entirely. The overwhelming majority of this book is just recycled content from its predecessor. I'm a big fan of Tolle, but this book is disposable. He briefly covers the most basic principles of vipassana meditation (focusing on your breath). The rest, you've already read/heard. Very disappointed that he would publish something that has almost ZERO new content or instruction. Same phrases, same instructions, sometimes lifted near-verbatim from his previous text(s). Skip it."
3,A disappointed admirer,"Although I have the utmost admiration for Eckhart Tolle and his teachings, I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed in ""Practicing the Power of Now"". Based on the title, I expected more in the way of meditations, techniques and exercises than were found in ""The Power of Now"", his bestseller, and the first of Tolle's works I'd read.Unless I'm mistaken, the few techniiques described in ""Practicing..."" are actually found in ""The Power of Now"", and this new book is little more than a condensed version of the first.My advice to someone wanting to explore the teachings of Mr. Tolle, would be to buy ""The Power of Now""...a more complete and original work."
4,Deep and meaningful,"Eckhard Tolle's companion book is spiritually focused and keeps us in the now. This is important for those who are afraid to be with themselves. Although his teachings are not new, his writing touches the heart and are profound. For those of you who wish to OPTIMIZE the now (rather than improve, manage or be with it), I recommend Dr. Rosalene Glickman's ""Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self."" She shows you how to embrace all reality as an expression of our humanity, and optimize the suboptimal. She has a roadmap for optimizing disturbing emotions which is truly unique and totally fulfilling. Keep both books on hand."
5,Excellent book,I am a big fan of Eckhart Tolle. I love all his books. They have had a deep impact in my life.
5,Extraordinary!,"I am utterly grateful for this book. Eckhart Tolle has given us a simplistic outline to provide the necessary practices, definitions, and fundamental descriptives required to conceptualize the Power of Now. Do not expect a discursive, narrative tome...read instead the original manuscript, The Power of Now, if that is what you want. This is the ""simplified"" version...explicit, available, concise...a wonderful introduction as well as a concise expositon of the basics of NOW...Read it and be transformed."
5,I AM SO HAPPY!!! l LOVE IT!,"The best yet I have gotten from amazon, it was brand new!!! I am very happy with my purchased Thank you very much!!!Thank you amazon!!!"
5,A great condensation of The Power Of Now,"The reader should be clear that this is a condensation of Eckhart's ""The Power Of Now."" I bought it after reading ""The Power Of Now"" and am glad I did. It was exactly what I expected. It takes the ""practice"" parts of his larger book and puts them between the covers so you can quickly find and review the ""how to"" without thumbing through the more expansive ""Power of Now."" I highly recommend this book if you loved Tolle's first one."
4,Practicing the Power of Now,"This is a great kindle companion to The Power of Now, which I have had in hardcover for about 15 years. I only give it 4 stars because there is a lot of intended redundancy with TPoN (so it is not ""needed"" if you have TPoN) but it is great have this on my Kindle to pull out anytime I want to get a few reminders on how to be present. I enjoy having it with me whenever I travel."
4,Awesome little book,This is a nice book to pick up once a day or so and read a page or so. It is like workbook where you get to read it and put it to practice and meditate on the words. You read it once and go back to read it again! I highly recommend this book.
3,Somewhat Helpful,Part 9 was helpful with practical tips for finding and maintaining a quiet space in the midst of life's busy distractions.
2,Havent finished it yet....BUT......,"I bought this book sometime ago and have only just recently started to read it.Today however i decided to see what people on Amazon were saying about it.I put the name in the search box and Hey Presto!..I see companion books,cds,dvd..in fact theres a whole industry going on here.When i see this kind of thing it makes me think is this a load of Bull or what?I'll continue to read on but won't hold my breath.Prepare for my indebt review somewhere down the road but for now already I'm feeling sceptical and i haven't even started."
2,Did nothing for me,"When I read this book, I found it to be very true. But I have never managed to integrate it into my daily life. I have tried just to do nothing, be present, and it tires me. It seems to me that his method of finding peace is to force it. It also seems to me to be a very apathetic way of life.I do not think this book is all crap, but it is way too extreme to be adapted for most humans. Of course it is good to be present, and not to be concerned too much about the past and future, but I rather suggest something in between what ""normal"" people do and Tolle's teachings, than to take things to its extremes.As many already have mentioned, this book is a repetitive zen ripoff. For people who are not familiar with this kind of books, I suggest reading something a little less extreme. This book can be dangerous."
3,HELPFUL EXERCISES TO EXPERIENCE THE NOW.,It is a follow up on the book by Tolle entitlted NOW and it has exercises that one can do to live in the NOW.
2,Same book as The Power of Now,"The Power of Now was such a hugely influential book for me that I ordered Tolle's other books. This one, however, consists of mostly exerpts from The Power of Now. If you haven't read that, then you should read The Power of Now instead of this. If you have read The Power of Now, then instead of purchasing this rerun, I suggest you re-read the Power of Now, as this is the same book, literally, word for word, although arranged differently. The message in The Power of Now is amazing, the most positive, life-changing book I've ever read. This book contains that same message(which is why I give it 2 stars instead of 1), so if you can only access this book and not the Power of the Now, you should read it. If you have read The Power of Now, skip this book, and if you haven't read it, read The Power of Now instead, if possible. That is my opinion."
4,i think hard cover edition is enough...,"I bought the EasyRead Large Edition, but i found it's...too large! the book is really large and the words are really large!i think it's not easy to read on the contrary. i guess the normal edition is good enough."
2,Not necessary to own,"If you own the book The Power of Now then you don't need this. I thought it was an actual workbook with exercises to help me practice Tolle's teaching, but it is actually a ""readers digest"" version of the book. I would have returned it but didn't want to lose the $3 Amazon charges for a return.PS - this was my first almost return to Amazon and I'm very disappointed in their policy. I will hesitate to buy anything from them in the future that I am not 100% positive I want."
5,Practicing the Power of Now,"A must for anyone who has read The Power of Now. It is a handy, bag sized book that you can take anywhere with you and read at any time. It cuts to the chase; all the important, helpful words and advice are with you whenever and wherever you need a reminder of your POWER."
2,Buyer beware,"This audio book is comprised soley of material from Tolle's first work, ""The Power of Now,"" and is merely respliced into a new order. If you have the first book, don't bother getting this one. If you don't, this book is equally accessible (obviously) as the first. The only difference, as far as I can tell, is that the first book is presented in a Q&A format, this is not.I'm a fan of Tolle's work. Sadly, the marketing industry has siezed the ""Now"" to make profits."
1,"Refund, Please !","Nothing new here - Repackaged the original book.The same ideas as Dyer, Hicks, Ruiz, and many other teachers - but oddly presented. Possibly a translation problem ?? Actually found it a rather negative presentation of some very positive ideas...Also, because I got the AudioBook, I wish he had found someone else to narrate - between the accent, and the monotone presentation, I found it difficult to listen to...A very disappointing purchase in every way."
3,Shape DVD,"I love the Shape bikini boot camp serious so I wanted to pick up some others that they have created. This morning, I tried to do the cardio segment and it just wasn't happening for me. There are too many dance inspired moves with their cardio high/low impact segments. They switch up too fast so if you aren't good at them, you don't work up a good sweat. I haven't done the toning yet which I am sure is good - their toning segments tend to be. Just beware if you aren't great with the dance moves. Find something else to do for cardio."
3,Okay workout,"While this was much better than the Shape Cardio workout, I thought it was just an okay toning workout overall. It was very choppy as other reviewers have mentioned, and just didn't flow well for me. Both instructors are great, the set was bright and cheerful, music was good. There was a great deal of variety in the exercises, but I honestly didn't like some of them, they just felt strange. Will be returning this one unfortunately."
1,"Will Not Get Your Body ""Bikini Ready""","I was really excited about this DVD after reading the great reviews, but found it very disappointing. Although there are some good exercises in each section there are NOT enough repetitions of each exercise, and I did the entire workout without breaking a sweat. As a very busy working mom, I feel like this hour long workout (plus the 20 minute bonus) is a waste of time, as there are many more challenging and effective toning workouts out there (try Tamilee Webb or Kathy Smith). I guess this workout is probably targeted to an older, less fit audience (which I consider myself a part of), but I have serious doubts that it could get anyone's body into bikini shape. I didn't even feel sore afterward, and wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone who's serious about getting in shape for summer!!"
1,waste of time and money,THis dvd was terrible...I am an on the intermediate level..and basically this tape is marketed to advertise Shape magazine not to workout.
3,OK. Not for the time-pressed.,"I'm an intermediate-advanced, regular exerciser. I've done the abs and arms segments of this DVD. I haven't done the lower body segment. Based on that, I think this DVD has good, all around, overall toning. But I didn't find it to be as challenging as I expected. I also don't think it's worth it for the time. There are three 15-minute segments, and from the two I did, I think they could have done more multiple muscle movements to give a better workout. I wouldn't suggest this for the time-pressed.I liked the 20 minute cardio add-on. This is not the toughest cardio workout I've done, but it's good for days when you want a quick, light cardio to get the heart moving and work up a little sweat."
3,yeah but...,It was nice at first as I kept popping in the dvd but it seriously gets boring and then the SHAPE Interlock titles between segments...ugh annoyance. No heavy flow to it.Though I say it was good at first. Beginners will love it! :)I still love the Cardio section though :)
1,Best for beginners,I was very excited to give this DVD a try after reading such good reviews. I thought it would be similar to the weight training class I take at my local gym. Unfortunately it did not live up to the reviews or my expectations. This is a great workout for beginners but not for people who have been at this for a while. It seemed like I was resting for at least 5 of the 15 minutes for each segment. I never once felt my muscles getting fatigued from the workout. After only trying it once I will be putting it up for sale and continue on with my pursuit of finding a challenging workout DVD focusing on weight training.
2,Too much Shape interruption,"This probably would be a great workout if I wasn't waiting for each exercise to start after the ""Shape"" logo that pops up after every exercise. I didn't finish the workout because of the lack of flow to it. If you don't mind a set-up period for every exercise than it'd be worth a try."
5,It's awesome!,"I liked what I saw in the pictures when I ordered it. When I received it, it exceeded my expectations. It is awesome!!!"
1,OCEAN PEOPLE!!!,"I was so very disappointed. There was so much film time showing the narrator talking about what they were trying to do with this film...the music to sell it etc. People on the boats, people snorkling with the sharks, there were too many PEOPLE instead of what was actually in the blue realm... I mean it was more skin than fin...showing some of the same scenes over...I will look for products from the BBC from now on. Even the kids lost interest with all the people instead of sea creatures."
3,Not my favorite,Maybe 3 1/2 stars. Had some good photography but..... too many humans not enough fish. Some sections were very enjoyable but it was far from being my favorite underwater video.
4,Same book as ritual magic of the golden dawn by Francis King,"This is a good book with the flying rolls that were sent out in the earlier days of the Golden Dawn with papers by S.L. Mathers, W.W. Wescott and others. The main reason I wanted to write this review is to let others know that this is just an earlier printing of Ritual Magic of the Golden Dawn, Works by MacGregor Mathers and others. I found this out when it came in the mail just as i was finishing the later publication. If you dont have the other its still a great book to add to your Golden Dawn collection."
4,Cumfy and Sturdy,"I was surprised by the stability of this stool. It is sturdy, it adjust well, and sits really nice. I have never owned a Sound Percussion product, but I love this stool!"
1,A mix up ?,"I ordered ""The Middle Ages"" and the packaging and labeling of the DVD were correct. However, the actual contents of the dvd was ""Inventions; The Technology of Warfare""."
1,underwhelmed,Poor video quality- seems like it was reproduced off of an old VHS!I didn't expect the scholarship and presentation to be earthshaking or new but it was so basic and bland as to be nearly as underwhelming as the quality of the video. Wouldn't recommend this DVD at any price.
2,Standard Coverage of the Time Period,"I had hoped that this survey of the Middle Ages would enlighten the novice to the immense and terrifying power exerted by the Church over every aspect of life, but it didn't really give much perspective on this. Consequently it didn't serve my purposes well, and I found the commentators rather too sanguine about the Middle Ages, praising the tactical warfare of mounted knights (like adolescent boys) with virtually nothing critical to say about the superstitious, anti-intellectual, patriarchal, sexist and oppressive aspects of those times. One does better to watch The Name of the Rose."
1,How Times Change,Well five years after publication we find the subject of this book in serious political trouble with members of his own party asking for a date for his resignation. Nobody in the UK believes what he says any longer and his chancellor is waiting in the wings to take over. One star and forget it.
5,Earth Science Power Pack (Regents Power Packs) by Edward J. Denecke Jr,"Delivered in time they said, better price then local book store and I believe hepled my son score a 94 on exam"
4,Good movie!,"I liked this movie. It was no classic, and it's garnering fairly mediocre reviews, or worse, but it was pretty enjoyable, and my wife and I both liked it. You can guess what happens, and Amazon foolishly gave away the ending with its synopsis here. Anyhow, I liked the movie because:1) Paul Abascal is a cool guy.2) Many people dislike the paparazzi, and within this movie we can live out a little fantasy about things turning around on them.3) The ending was great. Predictable, but good.Don't go into this expecting a five star movie, but if you're looking for something entertaining and well done for what it is, this movie fits the bill."
4,Hollywood's Revenge,"This is Hollywood's revenge movie against the Paparazzi, those goon photographers obsessed with getting celebrities' pictures at all costs, totally invading their privacy and often using the pictures in a dishonest way to invent gossipy stories for the tabloids.This was an easy call for Hollywood filmmakers because who was going to side against them in this film? The paparazzi, led by Tom Sizemore's character, is shown to be as sleazy and unethical as could be. So what you wind you up with a basic revenge story, nothing new or earthshaking but almost always entertaining in whatever form.In this film, the photo guys mess up and the victim - an actor (Cole Hauser) - takes revenge by going after them. In the process, we see how he does it and along the way are treated to some amusing cameos by Mel Gibson, Chris Rock and Matthew McConaughey. Yeah, it's kind of a low-brow revenge flick, but it works."
4,An Awesome Film!!!,"This is a really good movie that shows the negatives of being an actor. After 4 paparazzi photographers cause Bo Laramie and his family to be in an awful car crash, Bo hunts them down and gets his revenge. Detective Burton investigates, but I think he wants Bo to have his revenge. I highly recommend PAPARAZZI!!!"
5,hip-hip hooray for paparzzi!,"i love this movie. its scared me much but not too scary for the kids, haha!! bo laramy is a great acter."
3,A good movie ruined by the PG-13 rating.,"The producers could and should have made it R rated. They chose not to. By doing so, they missed what could have been a really great film.This movie goes into the sleazy ways of tabloid journalism and is about time that the theme should receive a good treatment. They had all the elements: a great idea, good actors, an excellent director, and so on. Well, a 7 million budget for a movie is not that much these days. You know how it goes: a million dollars ain't what it used to be.Anyway, that aside, when a cameraman hired to do a specific job misses the shot and the scene is not repeated, then you know things are on the cheap side. It was too bad.All in all, 1 star for the director who did a great job; 1 star for the theme; 1 star for the actors; 1 minus star for the PG-13 rating; 1 minus star for the disapointment. Total: 3 stars."
2,2 & a half,"This is a story about a Hollyweed celebrity who has had enough of a few members of the Paparazzi that have made his life hell. When they go too far by recklessly taking photos of him while driving, he and his family end up in an automobile accident. And all the Paparazzi do is take photos and print lies about it. Enough is enough to him and he goes after them himself with revenge on his mind.I thought the movie was OK, but I wouldn't wanna own it or see it again soon. It didn't interest me enough to want to see the bonus bonus features. I didnt think the main actor played it angry enough. I didn't feel like he was super p.o like he was supposed to be be playing. And I don't understand the cop looking' back all the time.Apart from that, it should have been more gory or more vengeful, there is hardly any real feeling of revenge. Quite frankly when it comes to revenge on the paparazzi i'd rather see scenes like in ""Seed Of Chucky""."
4,Entertaining,"Nice way to spend an afternoon. Action not too bad, and nice to see the slime take the beating they deserve..."
2,Pretty Basic Tutorial,"I learned a few things with this tutorial but most I had already taught myself. If a person were being introduced to his or her first database this course book would be helpful. I, on the other hand, am continuing my search for more definitive information about Paradox 7."
2,Disappointing product,"While this product helps clean the inside of the car's front window, it was not as efficient as we had been led to believe."
3,Interesting but not perfect,"Anyone who likes really clean windows knows that you have to clean the windshield about 3 separate times using many paper towels. The reason for this is that you have to remove all of that greasy film on the windshield. You would need to have about 10 spare bonnets to do the same thing with this tool. Otherwise, it just moves the film around from one place to another.On the plus side, it does get into those hard to reach places, and some that are impossible to reach otherwise. I found that you can fold a paper towel in half and then use this tool to move it around the windshield. So it does have some merit."
4,New cars NEED this,I bought a new car and discovered that those long sloping windshields are impossible to clean without this tool! The distance and angle of the inside of the windshield are impossible to reach unless you have an unusually abnormal ape-like arm. This tool does a fine job but I admit I resent having to buy it in order to have a clean clear view.
5,Makes windshields easy!,"I have a auto detail shop, some of the guys' hands are to big to get in corners of windshield by dash. This took care of that problem, and it does a perfect job. No smears!"
4,GLASS MASTER,"WAS PURCHASED FOR A GIFT, HE LOVED IT. CLEANING YOUR WINDSHIELD HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER. COMFORTABLE IN YOUR HAND AS WELL"
5,Very convenient,"Perfect length handle.The shape gets to edges of windshield with no stretching needed.With the blue cover, it holds a paper towel very well for finishing off the drying.Blue cover was easy to wash.To put the cover on, put the label down by the handle. Overlap the top point just a bit over the point and pull bottom on. Pull on around edges as needed. The cover stayed on just fine and went on easily enough.Has end for screwing on an extender pole, if needed.Comes with extra foam pad.Makes window washing go quite fast."
1,sent wrong product,I was so sad when I received a pair of size 40 pants instead of the tattoo sleeves i ordered. I had to go buy another chrismas present and now I don't even know if there is time to return them.I put them in my mail box before i left to go out of town and now that i'm back they are still here.
3,Hard to read,It is hard to read this on an e-book. I wish I had bought the hard copy. It has loads of interesting and worthwhile information.
1,No thought of thinking,"Do Not waste your money on this book. The tag line on the front of the book ""Sophisticated alternatives to comon words"" does not describe this book.The only sophisticated part of the book is........ well when you look up the word sophisticated in the book. First time I have written a review. I would have given it no stars but alas you must select at 1"""
2,Too Essoteric,"As a writer, most of what's in this volume is usless to me. Just somebody parading a uselessly unusual vocabulary."
2,this book sucks,"I though this book would really help my writting. Wrong, for every word, the book only gives you one other word to replace it with and although it states that these words are used by journalists, I find that incredably hard to believe because I haven't found a single word I had heard before yet. I guess if you are a journalist this would be a good book but for those who would just like to broaden their vocabulary, this book sucks!"
2,Good Idea,"Definitely a worthwhile project but frustratingly incomplete. I had expected it to list many - if not most - of the words found in Roget's but with more interesting synonyms. So far, it has been pretty useless. I hope they, or other parties, publish a more extensive version."
5,The best thesaurus you will ever own.,"A wonderful book for those who love words. Really, how can one go wrong when you see Christopher Hitchens in possession of The Thinker's Thesaurus?"
1,"Useless, Snarky Drivel","I never write reviews, but I am so disappointed with this book. I wanted a real Thesaurus--a tool for actual writing. This is just Peter E. Meltzers homage to himself."
5,The Thinker's Thesaurus,Fun to reference but some of the alternate words are more flamboyant or erudite than useful.
2,"Strip Tease, Werewolf, shmaltzy and so many other useless words","At the time of purchasing this thesaurus there were only two cheerleading type reviews and I bit the hook. What I have now is a book that doesn't have alternatives to words like 'legacy', or 'maintain'. However, there are plenty of alternatives to 'masturbation' and 'paraphernalia'. So what Meltzer is thinking when he chooses which words go in his thesaurus and which do not is the real question. This should be titled supplement to an actual thesaurus because as a stand alone it falls way short, especially with it's choice of second tier pulp-esque vocabulary."
2,disappointing book,"This book has a limited amount of entries and synonyms for each word.Also, many of the words are indeed antiquated. I only ordered it because I saw it on Christopher Hitchen's table during an interview.There are so many better thesauri available."
1,Too Arcane for General Use,"I do a lot of writing, and had hoped that this book would prove helpful when searching for Just The Right Word.Instead, I found it to be too arcane for general use, and I returned it.We used to get a holiday note from a fellow who, I believe, must have used this as his resource. We could scarcely decipher his jibberish."
2,"Use the ""Look Inside!"" feature before you buy....","There is an ultra conservative edge to the examples used in this thesaurus. I suggest that you use Amazon's ""Look Inside!"" capability to see if you can tolerate the condescension before you purchase. You do not need to look far to encounter examples that insult moderate and liberal leaders, thought, and beliefs.I have no interest in giving money to someone who has decided to insult people like me - under the guise of helping me to expand my vocabulary.bleh."
3,"Interesting, but not great","I found a lot of the content so obscure as to be unusable. For me, the standard thesaurus, no matter how banal one might think it, is still more relevant than this new one."
2,Not impressed,"I purchases this book after reading the other rave reviews. It does include some interesting words, and I really appreciate the examples of usage in a sentence. However, for the person who is searching for creative wording, the book does not offer a large selection of choices. This book might be a nice supplement to a substantive thesaurus like Roget's, but don't expect it to be a great reference. Personally, I wish I hadn't spent the money."
5,a relatively underrated album,The Red Hot Chili Peppers is considered to be one of RHCP's more unpopular albums. It contains a juvenile sound that is a perfect debut compared to their subsequent albums that contain a more mature sound. It is obvious that this album is a major influence on all future RHCP albums because of its distinctive funk style.
3,for live fans,"There are two CDs in this pack; one live, one studio. The live CD delivers the foot-stompin' soul energy with quality. It's a shame that the editing has cut some of the songs so short. Also some of the spoken intros go on too long. Otherwise it's a great stomper.The studio CD is a disappointment. After one listen I am not encouraged to listen to it again. It's a mediocre offering of standards other artists have done much better. Thank goodness the live CD is worth the urchase on it's own."
2,"Admirable effort, but the music is out-dated","Bravo to anyone who records and distributes a c.d. in his or her lifetime. Unfortunately, based on the Ashcan School Webpage and self-indulgent description of their music on Amazon.com, this band (or their publicist) needs to step back, join the rest of us in reality, and come to grips with the fact that the music is outdated and the lyrics unoriginal. ""Seattle's Best Band???"" I must have blinked and missed you guys at Bumbershoot this year."
1,"Great, but....","I suppose it was harsh giving this product just one star. See, it's a great product. I absolutely love this hot sauce. Great heat, and even better flavor. The Scotch Bonnet peppers are delightfully crisp and fruity; a wonderful compliment to the heat.I imagine it would be more fair of me to give the product a 5-star rating, and hammer the seller instead, but this was just handier.So why the single star review of a product I love? Because the seller sent me sauce that had expired months before my shipment, that's why! Shame on me for not looking to make sure that I wasn't receiving expired product, but come on....it wasn't even close.Took me a few days of exceptionally uncomfortable gastro situations to tie it back to my new, delightful sauce.To be fair, Amazon refunded the purchase price as soon as I reported that the awful seller sent me poison.I officially and fully endorse this sauce...just get it elsewhere."
3,Could have been better...,"This book is OK, but all the information is described in huge blocks of hard to follow copy with very few diagrams or case studies. You could probably get the same quality of stuff from an open-source search on Google. The methods described are at a basic to intermediate level.I bought 'Advanced Surveillance"" by Peter Jenkins as well and would recommend you buy it instead. You'll get far more value for your money! The techniques in this book (Advanced Surveillance) are at a far higher level and are described in more detail with lots of diagrams, case studies and examples."
5,A highly recommended read,I work plainclothes in law enforcement and found this book to be very practical. I thought it was very well written. I can tell that the author has to have real world experience because only somebody who's worked the streets could lay this out so clearly. I picked up some very useful tips that my team either never knew or just overlooked. I highly reccomend this book to anyone in a related field. I would've liked a little more detail on establishing a goodobservation post. And it is a little heavy on the unlimited resource end like the 4 member teams and the communications vest. Other than that it was definitely worth the read.
5,The best value anywhere on surveillance topics,"ACM IV provides the finest product available at its price. Not only is the value worth the purchase of this book in and of itself, but the material is absolutely top notch.During the course of my 25-year career, I spent my share of time conducting surveillances. I know many of the ins and outs.The entire ACM IV series should be a part of every tradecraft professional's library. And the pages should be dog-eared."
5,The best surveillance guide I have ever read,I think every person interested in having a career in surveillance should get this book. You will never look back! Excellent in showing you how to go about a surveillance operation.
5,A must-read for private investigators!,A very thorough book on all aspects of surveillance. Many tips and useful information for anyone in the P.I. business. A very informative guide.
1,Sent Back Two,"If only this worked!!!! I would have loved to have kept this, but we were unable to connect the two pieces. Upon close inspection, we realized that the threads were bent. Aha! Either this was a factory defect or someone else was having trouble with the connection. So we sent the deck and patio brush back in exchange for another. This time I showed it to my contractor who was also at a loss for how to fit the two parts together. Very disappointing and a waste of time."
1,Awful,There were two previous reviewers: one said it didn't work and the other thought it was wonderful. The negative review is the correct one. This product sounds so wonderful but it is not usable for the reasons stated by the other reviewer. There is simply no way to connect the two parts. The two little buttons on the sides of the sprayer which are supposed to allow the sprayer to be inserted into the broom part simply do not do so. I couldn't do it and neither could the landscaper. Do not buy this product.I tried to find an e-mail address for Carrand Outdoor to see if they would ship me another sprayer hoping it would work properly but could not find one thus leaving me with going through the arduous process of trying to repack the product back into a very large box that probably won't fit in my little car in order to return it to Amazon. This just goes to show why it is probably better to believe the negative reviews rather than those that praise a product.
2,Not 100% compatible with computers listed!,"I got it as a replacement/backup for my Dell XPS M2010 but discovered that while it would 'continue' to power my computer when plugged into an AC outlet, it would not recharge the computer's battery!!! For now, the unit sits gathering dust until something happens to my Dell's original power supply quit on me, then, and only then would I plug my XPS laptop into it just so I could continue working connected to the AC until a Dell replacement power supply arrives; I would only use it for the shortest time possible- and only in an emergency. Buyers Beware!!!"
4,Great layman's review of Medical Ultrasound Physics,I found this book very useful to get a birds-eye understanding of the physics behing medical ultrasound. The author uses metaphorical examples and images very nicely throughout the book to provide a very clear yet concise review of the subject matter. This book is not for you if you are looking for detailed mathematical analysis of ultrasound wave acoustics and beamforming.
5,Glutathione (GSH):Your Body's Most Powerful Healing Agent,"Jimmy Gutman, MD, FACEP and Mr. Stephen Schettini have come through again with an absolutely excellent glutathione reference book, containing three times the amount of information from their previous book, The Ultimate GSH Handbook. This well-written, easy to understand book explains in detail what one little protein that's in everyone of our cells actually has to do with health and disease. There are references at the end of each chapter to keep the MD's and the most detail-minded people informed about the latest in research about glutathione pertaining to different diseases described in each chapter, from Asthma to Cancer, from Heart Disease to Parkinson's, including Exercise and most importantly, regarding HEALTHY PEOPLE! What a wonderful book to learn from about this naturally occurring protein, glutathione."
1,Doesn't Play,It did not play in my DVD player as it was not compatible with Region play rights. it was returned
4,Learn every of Van Halen's moves!,"Learn the two hand tapping, whammy bar, fast hammer-ons, Volume swells, and more! It includes licks from Eruption, Runnin with the devil, you really got me, I'm the one, On fire, Atomic punk, Mean street, and many more! 50 licks in all. Duplicates Van halen's guitar tones. Played at two speeds. It sure improved my playing! END"
1,What a scam.,Trying to learn from this IN THE STYLE OF videos is a joke.I bought VH and KISS (. . .)threw both away
1,"I like this series,BUT NOT THIS ONE.","This is normally a great series,but this one is the worst.This is the first one in the ""In The Style Of"" series.All he does is play excerpts from Van Halen leads and he doesn't slow half of them down.The ones he does are still not slow enough.I can recognize songs by the intro,but it can be hard to do this to just the lead.I have heard that the Van Halen Volume 2 video focuses more on rhythms.If it does,get that one instead."
3,VanHalen technique,"For the price the video it was acceptable. A lot of attention was focused on Eddie VanHalen's equipment and how his particular sound is achieved. As a tutorial for learning VH riffs, it was fair. An experienced guitarist could probably pick out most of the riffs by ear. The novice would probably have a difficult time because in my opinion, Mr. Mitchell plays the riffs too fast. I also feel a better choice of riffs could have been selected. The ones demonstrated were fine for learning VH songs, but for use in building original riffs, I felt a better choice could have been made. Overall, any guitarist can benefit from this video, and for the money, its a good buy."
1,Not very factual,"I was disappointed by this book. Many of the assertions made regarding cats are simply untrue, and the moralistic tone was quite offensive. His denial of the predator-prey relationship will baffle anyone who owns a cat that is not confined to the house.He does not seem to differentiate between surviving and thriving. After much study it is clear that cats cannot do well long term on a vegan diet, he admits to seeing problems in male cats himself. Cats have nutritional requirements that can only be satisfied by meat (like Taurine), but in his disdain for meat processing methods he seems blinded by that.The pet food industry is deplorable, but their is no reason why a raw meat diet cannot be provided that was humanely raised."
4,Very Insightful for you & your furry companions,"Being a vegan myself, I thought that I'd find this book fairly interesting. I do like that it touched on taurine for cats. I always believe that cats couldn't be vegan but after reading the book, I think I may slowly make the switch and see how things go. Having companion animals, I never really made the connection that their food is a slaughterhouse byproduct and I'm contributing to it. Kinda makes you sit back and think for bit. Really, if meat & dairy isn't necessary for humans and causes nothing but health problems, why feed it to our other family members. I do hope that others read this book and educate themselves as I have. 2 Thumbs up, Jed.btw.. veganmercantile.com rocks!"
3,Not as expected,"Not much of a ""mysterium"" to find inside this album, definitely not 'magmum'. It is a good album indeed, but nothing special. If you like a 'metallic touch' onto good guitar rock, you should try it. If you're more into symphonics, melodics : leave it."
3,Warlord--good story but not as much erotica,"Jaid Black writes an interesting story, but this one is not one of her best. Although the plot is good, the story is short and lacks in depth feeling. The speed with which our heroines adapt to being kidnapped and sent 1,000 years back in time is not believable. Her erotica is less intense in this book and just a bit flat. Although it is a good read, I would recommend The Possession if your looking for a hot Jaid Black read."
5,Excellent. Good story telling for erotica.,"This was a fun story, very hot and good characters. Janet and Morag go through a mist which takes them back in time to 1052. They are found by two Scottish men who take them.Data:Story length: 103 pages. Sexual language: erotic. Number of sex scenes: nine. Setting: present day and 1052 Scotland. Copyright: 2001. Genre: erotic time travel romance.This story is also published in the anthology Bedtime, Playtime: Ellora's Cave..Other Books:For a list of my reviews of other Jaid Black books, see my 5 star review of One Dark Night."
5,Great American Indie!,"This great comedy was sadly overlooked when it first hit the Festival scene in 2001. Even with Roger Ebert behind it, it failed to secure a distribution deal, though it had great success on the Festival circuit, winning several awards. Now that it's available on video, don't wait to see this film that's sure to gain a devoted following. The humor is subtle and smart, and the performances are all great. It's impossible to tell why distributors didn't pick this one up. It's one of the better American indie films of the decade, and certainly one of the best indie comedies."
5,Book,"I bought this book for my daughter so she can retrain her 4 year old from such bad behavior, seem to be working"
4,You can't make me,Great book for those that need to be prodded and not thinking that they are.It is an awesome tool since we have two teen daughters.
5,Super book,"I could not put this book down! After struggling with my child and not understanding what was going on with her, I realize I have a strong-willed child! Ms. Tobias goes into detail describing how you can identify a SWC and presents many strategies in dealing with them. I know I have a very special child and Ms. Tobias gives practical advice in helping parents help a SWC to become a successful adult!"
5,Strong Willed Child,Best book for understanding the workings of a strong willed child's mind. It really helped me see why they so often seem to choose to do things the hard way. Highly recommend.
2,Unengaging and unhelpful,"I purchased this book as a suggestion from my childs therapist. It is a very short read and obviously written by a non-professional in the field. While the writer does make several accurate assessments of behaviors, the ways she recommends to handle them are usually impractical and does not consider parents with other children and the impacts of the solutions on them."
2,The Chritian thing,"I didn't really realize that this author was Christian and had to put that in the book. A lot of good suggestions and such but for a secular person, there was a bit too much God language. It probably wouldn't bother most people but I'm a little queasy around ""trust God"" talk."
4,Excellent first album,"A bit like Supergrass (OK, so a lot like Supergrass, circa I Should Coco) but not as much an immitation as an improvement."
4,Only one review?,"I felt compelled to throw another positive word on this great band -- hadn't considered the Supergrass thing, but I guess it's true, only the Sights are much more garage. A fun-as-hell romp with a strong Who influence, always a good thing. ""That Ain't Right Little Girl"" has gone on every mix tape I've made for friends in the past four months."
2,Supergrass revisited,"If you already own a CD by Supergrass, you already own this one. It's OK, pleasant enough, but it's been done before. Still, if you are waiting impatiently for the next Supergrass CD, this will fill the gap nicely."
1,Incorrect Title and Description of DVD,"I am so disappointed to buy this DVD with a false title and false description. I really feel cheated. This DVD is titled, Living with Wolves. It's a laugh to see about 2 minutes of 4 wolves in a fenced area being feed like pets do in what is called Wolf Conservation Center."
5,The Bloody Millstone of War,"Excellent book. Conrad did his homework before putting pen to paper in writing this book. His knowledge of the subject, and his passion for telling the story of the confederate cadets at war, comes through loud and clear."
4,Very insightful....and entertaining,"excellent book! I would have liked to have seen the author delve into several more of the cadets' lives, but what's there is great."
3,A story that needed telling.,This book was a much needed addition to the already large library of works on the Civil War. The only problem that I had with it was that he did not go into enough detail and really only told the story of a few of the cadets.
3,Very Very Very Basic...Good for those truly new to exercise,"I was disappointed with this book...but perhaps it is because I've moved way beyond where this program starts. This is a program truly for beginners to exercise...absolute beginners. I like that Bob does not focus on changing one's diet until you establish exercise as a routine; however, I do not agree with him on holding off strength training until the very end. Muscle burns fat--and can be just as, or even more effective than aerobics alone. Still, if you're new to exercise...this book will walk you through a gentle program which should have you exercising regularly in a few months. Another great book for beginners is Glen Gaesser's ""The Spark."""
3,"A good start...but as a trainer myself, there is more!","As a personal trainer I agree with what Bob shares. If you want change, Bob's book is a good, basic starting point, touching the mental aspect important to fitness success.However, many of my clients need to go further--to FIRST make an internal, spiritual connection that measures their worth outside of what we eat, how we look, who our spouse is, or how much money we make, etc. If you love OPRAH, and you really want a complete, easy to follow spiritual, mental and physical plan to lose weight for life, read DEBORAH LOW's, The QUEST for PEACE, LOVE and a 24-INCH WAIST. Her website (by her name) reminded me of Oprah's message to ""remember your spirit"". My clients are using it with incredible success, which makes my job a lot easier!"

2,Disappointment,"Despite Bob Greene's ambitious endeavor, I found this book to be very disappointing. Perhaps I was expecting a more diverse program. This book really seems to be an ""exercise manual"" with far too many charts and written activities. Although Bob Greene is probably an excellent personal trainer, I do not have the confidence in his emotional counseling as presented in this book. It might be a helpful book for some people, but a bit overwhelming for me."
4,"Nice program, but . . .","obviously more of a ""self-help"" guide for beginners. I find his nutritional guidelines lacking in that there is NO mention of protein or dairy products. That seems a serious omission to me. The weight training guide is bare minimal. But, overall, I think this would be a GREAT starting point for anyone just beginning their fitness quest."
5,Lenox Wedding Promises First Dance Fine China Cake Topper,We ordered this item for our future daughter-in-law and Son. She selected this cake topper from many that Lenox offers. Upon receiving it and having a chance to look at it first hand. She was very pleased with the purchase.
5,At last I've got it!!,"I always listen to the songs, which are on these CDs, when are played in a radio and every time I don't know which are the name of that songs, moreover I don't know the singer's names.Bud now, here it is. I realy love these CDs and I listen to them all the time.So, if you think of buying these CDs, don't wait neither moment.:-)"
5,The anniversary Gift,"This set was purchased for my sister and her husbands 50th wedding anniversary. They were married in 1959. If I had looked for weeks, I could not have found a better selection of songs, mostly romantic, from 40's, 50's, 60's. It is abosuletly wonderul and was enjoyed by many. Quite a few intend to purchase this same set after hearing the songs at the anniversary party."
5,My Granddaughter's Favorite!,My five year old granddaughter can't get enough of this game! It's great and the little ones actually have a chance to win since it's based on chance more than skill. It's great fun.
2,Simplistic game,"Your four year old should be able to ""get it"" in one play. After that, there's not much to learn."
4,Good fit.,"We were looking for a cap to fit my son, whose head is now 18.5"" at 15 months. This fits well and can stretch. The sizing states 0-3 and I doubt he will still be able to wear it after about age 2, but otherwise good value for the money."
2,Barely Useful,"I bought 2 rotation diet cookbooks when I found out my family had severe food allergies. This had recipes and a suggested rotation menu for 4 days, but that was it. It was designed for England, so some of the foods were different. The food families were not numbered, just listed, so you couldn't tell by looking which foods were related to which. It was very limited in terms of recipes and setup. I would not recommend it, and I would not buy it unless I needed more recipes for my rotation diet. Even then it might not work because its plan may be too different compared to yours. I highly recommend ""5 years without food"" by N. Dumke instead."
3,Somewhat dissapointing.,"Coming from Cemetary Dance , I expected these to be truly scary and gory. I was quite dissapointed. Not splatterpunky enough for my taste. But some of the stories are quality, just not enought in sucession to keep my interest."
1,Save your money and effort,"I bought this book because it was on sale at Costco and I had just started using FP 2002 and didn't have any references. The few times I have tried to look up a topic in this either it wasn't in the index (example follows) or the explanation explained nothing. I inadvertently misset my SaveResults option for my feedback page and since I hadn't looked at that page for a long time I couldn't remember exactly how it worked. Although there is a (poor) illustration of a feedback page on page 701, unbelievably ""feedback"" does not occur in the index. It took around 30 minutes of searching to find this. Although this was the most egregious example I've had there have been numerous others that I didn't think to document. This is one of the worst computer books (of 100s) that I have ever owned."
3,Not a learning book.,Don't let the inspiration of seeing it's thickness make you buy this book or you'll end up with dissappointment.Although this book will give you high detail about using frontpage but it will not show you how will make a concrete and real world web pages.All you'll get is pieces of jigsaw and you'll have a hard time figuring it out.It's not a book you learn from scratch!
3,running FP guide.,Another cheap buy. I bought this at the same time when i bought Frontpage 2000 developers guide. It helped me deal with a business company's website system.
3,Mediocre title -- inconsistently organized,"To pick a topic to illustrate: FP has both themes and templates. It would be nice to get a compare/contrast, since templates are used in many products. Why choose one and not the other? No go. A chapter called ""Using web-based front page components"" is the place where templates are ""explained"" in 4 pages. What that chapter should be called is: ""Front page components that don't require FP extensions"".The themes section has a whole chunk of information on color theory. Why? There are good books on basic web design -- and color theory would seem to apply to more than just themes."
2,Not what I had anticipated,"This book didn't meet my expectations. As another reader mentioned, the author spent a great deal of time talking about colors and style-sheets. Although they are important topics, I bought the book to learn about frontpage 2000. I fumbled around in FrontPage for about 2 weeks prior to purchasing this book. This book didn't tell me anything more than what I had already learned from using the program. So my recommendation is if you are new to frontpage and web design, this might be a good book for you. If you want to take frontpage to the next level , buy ""FrontPage 2000 Developer's Guide""."
1,Fulsom Praise for FrontPage,"This book contains pages of useless palaver about the ""Web moving from obscurity to the mainstream"", ""anything involving two or more persons involves politics"", ""good page layout involves balance: use of the left margin as well as the right..."", ""real life offers-as does Web page design- a countless variety of potential contrasts"", and so on, and so on. No topic deserves less than a long paragraph of zero content. The book also is really annoying in the way it pushes the product, talking about ""rich"" features, ""making things easier than ever"",""the force of FrontPage themes"".When push comes to shove, features simply are cataloged. With little attempt to link features to a complete project, or to answer natural questions that pop up as one goes through a project, the book forces one to flip back and forth trying to answer this or that.Bottom line: much blather, little direction"
1,Absolutely unacceptable.,"Well, I even do not know if I received the product that was advertised. The bottles did not have any normal ""for your protection"" seals and ""don't use this product if the seal is broken"" disclaimer. Also and because of the absence of the above mentioned seals the lids did not hold and let the soap out into the box during delivery. It is very much likely that they used bottles from the product they advertise to sell something else. AND it spilled. BOTH these things are unacceptable and possibly, at least one of them, illegal. So, decide for yourself if you want this product especially from this particular seller ToiletPaperWorld."
1,Too many errors...,"I bought this book hoping to add an informative piece to my collection of classic car books. I was horribly disappointed to find NUMEROUS mistakes in both information and illustration. Example: In the description for a 1961 Chrysler Imperial the book has a photo of a 1963 (there is a WORLD of difference between the two). If you wanted to see the best feature of a 1959 Cadillac (the FINS), you're out of luck. They show only the front view. The technical info is a mess (WAY too much to list here). In short: Both the author and editor failed to provide accurate information. They should have done their research before rushing this publication to market. On the bright side... it will make fine bird cage liner."
5,Beautifull and delicates!!!,This Folding Fans are amazing products. I use the fans at my wedding. I submit to ecclesiastical wedding attendants because it was very hot.
2,Ok fan,I ordered these for our wedding in July. I returned them after we opened them due to the quality was not what we were expecting. They are ok but maybe not for a nice wedding.
4,Wedding Fans,"The fans were fantastic and sturdy. They arrived quickly and they kept our guests cool during our outdoor, June wedding."
2,Need to drill holes,"The wood is too soft, and need to drill hole (should be pre-drilled for easy DYI). We spent too much time make measurements and drill holes."
2,Not a bad film... just a bad print,"The movie was pretty good, with lots ofshots of some of Chagall's most lovely pieces. But theDVD was very blurry and the colors were VERY faded throughout, makingus feel like we were watching a VHS tape that had been dubbedfrom another VHS tape which had been dubbed from another... and another.One other complaint was the painfully poor dubbing over Chagall'svoice during the Q&A; session. It was distracting and amateurish.The onlything worse than the dubbing was watching Chagall's wife trying to translate what he was saying into English. She clearly hadno talent for translating, and admitted it. Why didn't the director use subtitles?"
5,Beautifully done and interesting,Our family really liked watching this about the monarch butterflies and their migration across the United States down to Mexico. My husband lived in Mexico when the butterflies passed through several years ago... when the ground looked like it was moving with so many everywhere. We enjoyed watching this amazing journey of one of God's creatures.
5,Nature at it's best,"I saw this on Nova recently and was so fascinated I didn't even blink during the whole thing! I'm giving it to my grand-daughter ( if I can part with it) because it is so well done and the story so Incredible! Makes you think - ""if a butterfly can do this, I can do anything"""
3,Intriguing and educational,"The 1st part of this video is Absolutely Marvellous......but the author added much laboreous content on survival to it_ making it serious for those who simply want to enjoy the butterflies....Survival is important but sometimes we just want to relax.I'm going to try On the Wings of a Monarch....and.....Tropical Gardens and Butterflies.I would really like it if some producer would film some more DVDs on different species of BUTTERFLIES.....and have some especially nice music_ that is quiet, dainty and uplifting at the same time....I can imagine that would be a really niceexperience for people."
2,Beautiful video but unexpected material,The video was beautiful but had unexpected coverage of Hispanic mysticism... day of the dead and worshiping dead relatives... not what I expected in a butterfly movie... I bought the movie for my 5 year old daughter who likes butterflies but I had to turn it off...
1,refused to accept return for exchange,i mistakenly ordered blu-ray dvd and i cannot view this on my dvd player. I asked if I could exchange it for a regular dvd and they refused. Not happy.
2,Not far enough from wall,"This is sturdy, but it mounts too close to the wall. This is a huge problem for me. Saw the post about mouting it to a ceiling joist - I'm going to investigate that."
4,An Operational Necessity: Well written & enlightening.,"Griffin conveys the ""feel"" of the horrors of submarine warfare very well. The book contains much that is gripping. Unfortunately it also includes long passages of character development that are somewhat tedious but quite important for having clear understanding of the last third of the book. In spite of that one weakness, I gave it 4/5 stars. (I'd have given it 3.5/5 were that possible.) I recommend it to those who readily become engrossed in WW II submarine warfare stories and/or those who value stories that offer a clear exploration of the awful stresses of survival at sea in a life raft."
2,The New Terrorism: More of the Same Old Stuff,"For those readers wanting a survey of modern terrorism and its possible courses of development, this book will suffice. The New Terrorism presents a well-researched case that the intent of modern terrorists may increasingly be to simply cause death and damage. The author's inclusion of the criminally insane within his definition of terrorism is simultaneously disputable and thought provoking. However, the book does a poor job in thoroughly exploring the concept of WMD terrorism. This, in conjunction with organizational problems and some of the author's style choices, should place this book somewhere other than the top of potential reader's buy lists. Jessica Stern provides a far better alternative in her ""Ultimate Terrorists."""
1,READ THIS FIRST,"As a practicing Odinist, I find this book to be extremely persecuting. Because of this author, and many like him i might add, many people are misled to think that all Odinists are White Supremacists, which just is not true. I think authors, like this pud, should be more wary in there choice of words and make it known with even the vaguest acknowledgement that a small faction of Odinists is of an Aryan mentality. I had to say my piece in defense of all my indiscriminate Odinist sisters and brothers in the world, so farewell."
4,Great Cranberry Caps,This is a really high concentration of cranberry you don't usually see. Wish it was available in larger quantities. Excellent for the ladies urinary tract.
5,Love these guys together,"These guys are great together. I am also trying to get ""Tribute to Tito Rodriguez,"" which is also made by them, if available."
5,I love micron pigma pens,These pens are excellent for drawing or writing. They don't bleed and are permanent. They last for a long time without drying out and the colors are true.
3,Must-have book for beginner indoor gardeners.,"A great book for beginners, with a section on how to measure the amount of light your plants receive which I found to be very helpful. The last section lists some houseplants commonly found in any supermarket or flosrist shop. Excellent color photos."
2,Endurance in more ways than one!,"Taking up from the cliffhanger of the previous book, sees the increasingly superhuman (and inhuman) Cherijo enslaved, hated by her fellow slaves and back to square one in her relationship with Duncan. Viehl writes as compellingly as ever but the story turns out to follow an increasingly violent and monotonous pattern of plucky defiance followed by punishment and torture interspersed with the good Doc saving all and sundry in the Medlab. Chojero appears increasingly dour and embittered and the lovely humour that leavened Stardoc is largely missing, apart from a brief subplot with 2 alien teenagers. The good Doc has little to do apart from fend off her various suitors or torturers. I do hope the next book has a lighter touch, but at least this one did not end in a cliffhanger!"
4,endurance a stardoc novel,Never have read science fiction before but she really knows how to write an interesting tale!!!!
2,The torture of this reader,"I had high hopes for an enjoyable third installment of Cherijo's adventures as Stardoc. After the third detailed description of her being tortured I had to put the book down. I do not find it entertaining to read about heroines being harmed when it adds nothing to the story. More could have been explored with interspecies dating, friendships and the issue of how dumb is Cherijo when it comes to men. I found the character Cheijo not as entertaining in this book, she is stuck hating her mate, being hurt, hating her man and then at the very end she is happy and well as if this was an insipid romance novel. I recommend the first two books in the series for introducing a likable and strong female character. Skip this one."
5,Endurance Another StarDoc book.,I have just finished Endurance by S.L.Viehl. This book was part of the StarDoc series. I found the book an excellent read. I would reccomend this book and series highly.
3,I keep on wanting to know what happens next,Subject line says it all: I keep on wanting to know what happens next but I'm not sure that I'll continue buying books in this series.
4,Speaking Spanish Like a Native,I have found this book to be helpful in my studies of the language. It definitely is the language of everyday Mexico.
3,Near the end,"This is the last album Magneto recorded of all-new material, as its last album (""Siempre"") mixed greatest hits with new songs. Charlie had exited the group by this point, but the overall harmonies are not affected that much. Unfortunately, the songs aren't as strong as previous Magneto hits, though the dancefloor track ""Siempre Cerca de Mi"" is a great, rousing number."
2,breaks easy,"The pegs on the bottom of the animals break easily, the gears seem a little stronger but I am disappointed."
3,Fun but not durable!,"This is a great toy, fun to play with. My daughter is not yet 2 and we have been helping her play with this toy for a while. The pieces are a bit tricky to set up but once you get them in place you turn the handle and the geras move and turn pretty well. I do have one complaint the animals and trees are inserted into place and are sitting on top of 2 very thin plastic pieces that extend out of each piece. My daughter was trying to place one in and it broke, once that bottom piece brakes, that particular piece is no longer usable. I also don't know why I thought you would turn a switch on to make everything turn, it is a manual toy. Very creative piece, kind of like a fancy leggo!"
3,Dickies Sizing is Very Strange!,"A few weeks ago I ordered some Dickies school pants for my son in a size 8 slim. They ran EXTREMELY small and slim. So, I sent those back and ordered three other pairs--different sizes and styles trying to find something to fit. My son is really a very normal-sized kid and we've never had trouble fitting clothes to him before. First we tried the 'flex waist' size 8 ... WAY too tight in the waist with the adjustment all the way out. The length was good, though. Next we tried the pleated front size 10. WAY too big everywhere--waist, seat, and length. I had also ordered an 8 husky in case the 8 regular was too small. Well, the husky was HUGE! My son thinks they need to make a size 9! I agree.Dickies Boys 8-20 Pleated Front Pant - School UniformDickies Boys 8-20 Flex Waist Flat Front Pant - School UniformAs for the quality ... they seem very well made and durable. I just wish he could wear them!"
3,"Decent pants, but make sure to order a size up","These pants seem like they would hold up for a long time. The material is thick but not very soft. They run at least one size small. My son usually wears a 16 and typically has a little extra room in them. I ordered the 16 in these pants, and they are way too tight in the waist. They fit like they are a 14, maybe even a 14 slim. The length is pretty much right on for a 16."
5,MOST EXCELLENT!!!,"I won't bother repeating what others have already said...BUT this is REALLY a great book. As a result I am sitting here at my computer wirting my thoughts while waiting for the 2 ""AVATAR"" books and ""Rising Son"" to arrive from Amazon.com; This book is that good that I wanted to know what happened before- we get a little info at the beginning with ""Linear Time"", but I wanted MORE! Forget the nay sayers' put downs- Ms Perry has hit DS9 on the nose! Can't wait for more!"
1,Awful,"I love to read, and read anything and everything from Stephen King to John Grisham to Louis L'Amour. A good book is a good book, and I rarely put something down when I start it. However, this book was so awful I couldn't bring myself to read further than the first few chapters. I tried to give it a chance - I really did. Christopher Golden, however, doesn't need to quit his day job. He's created a bunch of 15-year-olds that act and sound more like 20-year-olds, only when I was 15 or 20 years old I can't say I knew anyone who talked or acted like these kids. They're certainly nothing I can identify with and all I can say is, Golden was either living in another world when he was 15 or he wishes he was. The writing is bad, the characters are silly and tedious, and I can't imagine why Peter Straub would ever endorse something like this, unless he's a relative. So many books, so little time... life is too short, so read a GOOD book!"
3,"Truly Lost, Boys!","I was really looking forward to reading this book. The descriptions I had read were leading me to the adventure of a lifetime. That didn't happen. What happened was I read an okay book about some high school friends who suddenly find themselves in a real-life, twisted Neverland. The adolescent angst story was good but when they found themselves in Neverland, it went too crazy too fast. There should have been a bit of reality that follows them into the Neverland. Or perhaps there wasn't enough of a buildup of fantasy to make us truly believe we've plunged into a violent, bloody Oz. If the transition had been smoother, the book would have been more enjoyable. As for Golden, his style is very readable and I plan to give him another chance. I've started the ""Shadows Saga"" and I hope it lives up to it's hype. ""Straight On 'Til Morning"" did not."
5,Splitsville is great,"Highly recommended. Recommend purchase from Notlame.com. Ordered dozens of CDs from them (including this one) and never had a problem.That other anonymous person is a moron, although s/he appears to have good taste in music.an auditeer"
3,Not Sure What To Do With This Information,"I enjoy Larry Crabb's books and think he brings enlightening and extremely thought-provoking Biblical/spiritual insights to psychological problems.The first three-quarters of this book develops - maybe even ""overdevelops"" - a convincing thesis for the need to look deep into our hearts to identify the subtle sinful ways in which our unacknowledged prior hurtful experiences inhibit our ability to experience deep, healthy relationships with other people. However, in the last section, ""Changing From The Inside Out"", Dr. Crabb provides little in terms of specific techniques for using this knowledge to ""improve"" our hearts and, thereby, our relationships. At the end I felt I'd learned something that is, in theory, very powerful, but I'm frustrated because I can't quite tell what I'm supposed to do with this knowledge"
5,"Life changing, gut wrenching, a must have","Larry Crabb's Inside Out is a book worth reading, pouring over and re-reading. Larry doesn't just say how to make changes in your life, but to let you know hope exists. I enjoyed the book because I can really relate to the struggles Larry mentions. This book is not about a 12 step program but a book about reality and how to thrive in it."
4,A Book for The Aching Soul...,"Inside Out is an excellent book on the relational struggles that Christians face on a daily basis. Many Christians around the world believe that the longings of their heart can only be fulfilled when they get to Heaven. But Larry Crabb believes otherwise. He believes that too many Christians just simply say to ""have faith"" when they can actually do something about it. ""We were designed to enjoy a better world than this,"" says Crabb. This book is not about relief, but about change. Crabb is a very straight forward writer and recognizes the needs of this fallen world. He addresses the underlying issues of the heart that affect the lives of so many ""longing"" Christians. Larry Crabb believes that ""real change is possible if you're willing to start from the inside out."""
3,Madison,"Insise out was a very meaningful book, when i first picked up this book i was just looking for an easy read book. Which, yes was true i finished it in a day but the thing about this book is that it is very strong, and meaningful. This book is about Zak trying to get over his illness. It's the voices in his head that are telling him to kill himself. this whole book is a seat jumper. I really enjoyed this book, i thought it was quite depressing but it was so strong that i loved it."
1,Read Dallas Willard Instead,"Okay, I'm a sinner. I knew that already, had a pretty good idea of what that means. But Crabb would have me wallow in it, reflect on my sin, roll around in it and focus on it exclusively. I simply don't believe that's what God intends. Crabb gives little to no Biblical support to back up his delineation of the types of issues in our lives. And his final chapter, where he tosses off a few clichés about joy, is beyond weak. It almost feels as if it pains him to admit there *is* any joy in our life with the Lord.Frankly, this reads as if a professor of Abnormal Psychology tried to write a ""regular"" psychology textbook, but couldn't get his slant for the ""abnormal"" out of the way. It is repetitive, self-absorbed, and misfocused.If you want to read a truly great book on spiritual renewal, go for Dallas Willard's ""The Divine Conspiracy"" or ""Renovation of the Heart."" Now *those* are books that will help you change from the ""inside out."""
3,inside out,I liked this book because it shows problem of a illness that the main charecter zack has and how he tries to kill himselfe because of the voices in his head thats why he has to take medicine.
2,workout is repetitive.,"I personally didn't find it to be interesting. it music isv the same beat over and over and over, it's not a workout video which actually makes you want to workout. after the first 10 minutes all you want to do is turn it off."
5,UNA BELLEZA !,"No he leído nunca un libro que me hiciera tantos beneficios como este..! Es breve, pero con mucho contenido: Tiene un enorme sentido del humor respecto a la vida t nos contagia con el Gozo de Vivir !"
4,Surprisingly interesting and detailed subject,"With the largest wilderness areas in the world, hostile climates and unfriendly local populations, Russian pilots had better know effective survival techniques and have good equipment. And they do! A very refined science, Russian survival tech has saved countless pilots, and cosmonauts too! This is the only text to cover the subject and includes a complete translated copy of their issued manual using the original illustrations. Lots of color photos details all their gear."
2,Yuck,"I thought this would be have a new fresh taste after all those mint flavors on the market, but I was very disappointed. It wasn't even close to lemon-lime."
1,Don't waste your money,"I received this ""player"" as a gift for Christmas in 1998. Within a year, it was completely shot and would not even read or play CD's, even brand new CD's. It wouldn't play in any mode. I had previously owned a JVC single CD player for nine previous years and never had any problems. I don't care how attractive this player is because of the price, it you spend money on it you will be very disappointed when it fails to operate. And I didn't operate the player in adverse conditions. Cheap junk. The salesman tried to tell me that the laser eyes have changed in the newer models but I still say this player is not worth crap."
1,Don't even think about this one,"This is the biggest piece of junk audio equipment I have ever owned, It lasted about one year before it didn't work anymore. Do yourself a favor and spend a couple of extra bucks and buy a quality brand. RCA's audio products are all cheap junk like GPX, but with the RCA name slapped on them."
1,Great reviews on a bad product,"The reviews were great but....The first one I got skipped segments ofdiscs 2 when in shuffle mode. Sent it back to Thomsen Electronics andpromptly received a replacement. This one does nothing but perform 'READ"" function and then says No Disc. Now I'm mad at RCA and Amazon for selling this piece of junk."
1,Disposable CD Player!,"For...I shouldn't expect much. It was fine when it worked, But 1 week after the warrenty expired it started to act up. Now it won't play at all."
1,Worthless,"While the game NFL2K5 is pretty good, the accompanying guide (and the guide for the NCAA game) are remarkable for being so utterly worthless. The author(s) seems to have watched a couple of sports centers and then writes for each team that so and so is good, and so you should use play using these players. The actual plays themselves and the mechanics of the games are hardly dealt with.--Guys, how about, like, telling us what a cover two rotating zone is and why this is useful against certain offenses? Nah, you'd have to do more than skim ESPN sports center.--Buy the game, but under no circumstance waste your money on these ""guides""."
3,Good Introduction,"George Steiner's brief intro is surly competent and his investigation of Heidegger's use of the German language is particularly well informed. Steiner is commenting on Heidegger's corpus more as a cultural commentator rather than a philosopher, but he still gets most of the fundamentals correct. While often labeled as a work of populism, I found this monograph to be a fruitful study-Steiner shines in situating Heidegger in the greater context of German cultural life. It's also interesting to see the ways in which this text is hopelessly dated. Steiner mentions that the Gesamtausgabe will be over 60 volumes, today it's over 100. Nevertheless, this is not a bad introduction to the work of Heidegger, and it also provides some useful commentary on his infamous political behavior."
2,Outdated,"This is a nicely written book, very easy to read, but a bit philosophically facile. More problematically, it was written before the biographical revelations came out in the 1990s and as a result it is dated and factually inaccurate. The Safranski biography is MUCH better."
3,clock radio,Product works good as an alarm clock. The radio reception is fair to poor. The numerals should have been made so that they could be dimmed.
4,The Florida Keys : A History & Guide,"We spend our Christmas at a place we have in one of the lower Keys,love the place and the history, this book covers very well the storys and ""how come"" of the keys, a must have if you have a interest in the way of life down here and why people love to come to this place.DWS"
4,Informative,"Purchased for an upcoming trip to the keys, granted I am halfway thru so keep that in mind... I wanted to embrace the vibe and with this book you feel that the vibe was destroyed by humans within the past 50 years. It is in depth, informative and well written but with an undercurrent of ""you should have seen it when""... I am still looking forward to my visit but with an eye more on what it used to be. Mayhaps that was the intent of the author??"
4,Florida Keys,"This book was a great information source. It is a must read for anyone planning on vacationing in the keys. It has things you need to know about every spot in the keys. It doesn't just mention the good things. The book will tell the good and bad spots of the keys. After reading this book, you would have thaught that you had been to the keys yourself. The author has clearly spent alot of time in the keys. She must have done alot of research for the information in this book. The author must love the keys alot to spend this much time in writing and reading this book. This book is a very easy to read tour guide. It is fun to read and teaches you all of the history of the keys. This book has detailed descriptions of places to stay and places to eat. It will tell you fun things to do and has interesting facts about each place. It also has all of the history you need to know about all of the keys."
2,"A ""guidebook"" that discourages you from visiting","I have a trip scheduled for the Florida Keys this month. I finished reading this book last night and now I have the distinct feeling that for the good of the Florida Keys I should stay away from them. I can't believe all the hype and positive reviews, all the ""best guidebook ever"" stuff. As far as the comments about how well written the book is, I won't argue with that. It is a well written book. But it's also cynical, negative, and disdainful of the tourists and visitors who vacation in the Keys. If you are planning a trip to the Keys and have already purchased this book, I'd recommend that you wait and read it after your trip. Otherwise, you're going to be in the same situation as I am - still looking forward to my vacation but not sure if I can get over the guilty feeling that I'm yet another horrible tourist contributing to the ruin of paradise."
2,Bushwacker 38002 SmoothBack TailGate Cap,"Very poor fit, product is short of tailgate width by 3/4 of an inch which is way more than is required to allow for expansion of material. Also packaging is very poor allowing the product to twist in shipment resulting in a few small kinks in the product's edge."
5,Fruit accents before and after the heat,"When used in moderation (a few drops) it can spice up an entire bucket of chili for those with less than iron stomachs and tongues. When used as a few drops on a single portion of food it can impress even the most insane chili head. The only sauce that I stock in my cabin for the winter, great on game."
2,too fancy,"While I thought I would love this, I have yet to make a single dish from it. It is way to fancy for our taste and just not practical."
3,pretty but not so practical,"I saw this book in Anthropologie and saw one recipe that I wanted to make and it's a pretty illustration. However I don't know if there's alot in there that I will actually cook, but it was half price on Amazon c/t Anthropologie."
5,Good Experience,Cable was factory made and performed as expected. Vendor was excellent. Product was delivered a day earlier than expected.
1,Do NOT read this book if you have filed for divorce,"If you wish to be told how bad divorce is, how dumb you are to choose it, and to feel condemned by the authors for divorcing, then this is the book for you! If, however, you are looking for a metaphysical approach to help you get through your divorce emotionally and spiritually intact, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! It is awful. O.K., to be fair, the metaphysical principles are sound and positive. However, this book is primarily a condemnation of divorce. Most shocking and upsetting was the recommendation that party who had been left say to the children, ""Tell Mom (or Dad) that I still love her (or him)."" It's ironic to me that the book talks about the importance of thinking positive and sending out positive waves, the proceeds to describe divorce in the most negative way I have heard. What a waste of time and money!"
2,Not a Good Book,"This book did not help me at all. Nick Campion uses all kinds of big extravagant words, which just confused me more. I bought this book thinking I would be getting THE ULTIMATE ASTROLOGER, when all it really does is tells you how to do a whole bunch of math (which I came to find I could get my birth chart off of the internet for free within 10 seconds, without having to do any math). I spend 6 hours adding up and calculating my birth chart before discovering it was free on the net. This book is definitely not for someone who does not like math. Another thing about it that I really dislike is the fact that it contains almost nothing about synastry. NOTHING."
2,Not for those with eating disorders,"This book may be appreciated by those who do NOT have eating disorders and eat poorly, don't exercise, and/or are overweight. This book draws strongly on the fields of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, so the reader should be okay with that or not read it. The authors say that looking in a mirror objectively is a good way to tell if you are overweight, that there ARE ""good"" and ""bad"" foods, and even disclose how many calories are burned per hour of certain types of exercise. All of these things are not conducive to recovery from an eating disorder. In the last chapter, they come across as basically blaming the family, whether they intended it to be that way or not.If you have an eating disorder, do not read this book."
4,Overall Good,While I don't aggree with everything in the book. The book provides a good overview of males with eating disorders as well as Dr. Holbrook's personal story. I think some of the low ratings are because certain chapters are hard to understand but it is overall a good book.
1,Don't bother.,"This book is a big disappointment. Offers no valuable insights for men with eating disorders. Andersen is called the leading authority on this subject but I cannot fathom why this is so. Most likely, he and the other editors/authors just wanted to be the first to publish a book like this. Unfortunately, they were not up to the task. Hopefully, someone who understands this topic more will eventually publish a more useful book on the subject."
2,LAG LAG LAG!,"I bought this mouse at my local Staples store. After 2 days of use, I gave it to my sister. The most major issue was the lag. There always seemed to be a slight millisecond lag between when you move the mouse and when the cursor moves on the screen. This wasn't noticeable until you needed precise movement, like in a game or when photo-editing with Photoshop. I found it impossible to do precise movements. Very dissapointing. This seems to be a problem with most cordless mice. The mouse is also heavier then other mice of this size, due to the 2 AA batteries inside. The only good thing I found was that the wireless system had a distance of like 10 feet. If your just gonna surf the net, or do other mundane tasks on the PC, I guess this mouse will be fine. If you need precise and lightning fast movement, you should pass and stick to corded mice. After giving this one to my sister, I ordered myself a Logitech MX510."
4,Great for the Price,"I don't know what the lag complaints are about. I just bought this mouse 3 days ago, but I have experienced no lag at all. In fact it is working better than my microsoft corded optical mouse that it replaced. I am very happy with this mouse and generally prefer Logitech to other brands. You should take a look at the Logitech G7 Laser Mouse for a high end cordless (great for gaming)."
4,Receiver a little too big,"The mouse is very nice. The lagging is not a issue like the first review said. It sometimes happens, but you can play with the settings. The receiver is a little big, but you can hide it behind your monitor. I'am running Windows 2000 and Linux. Both operating systems saw the mouse. Even Windows. It comes with a USB to PS/2 Converter. I'am plugged in via USB. I may change it to PS/2 if it starts acting up. The main reason I bought this mouse was the battery conservation. Which so far has been pretty decent. Other then the receiver being a little big, it is one of the best mice I have used."
1,plastic housing,"The problem with many of these filters, is the housing material. Brittle plastic ones will crack, as was the case with this one. In fact it cracked on the first usage, however the company refunded the full cost, with no hassles. I liked the design because it didn't reduce the shower height.I"
1,Didn't notice any difference,"I live in Tampa, FL, where the water is downright toxic. I tried a Paragon filter on my shower when I got sick of the feeling that my hair had a coating on it even after washing it. I have replaced the cartridge in the filter, thinking that would help, but now I've just given up on this filter. I didn't notice any difference at all, and I am now searching for a better one. I only got this type because it's the only brand Home Depot had. I don't recommend it if you have serious water problems like we do here in Tampa, where something much more powerful and efficient is necessary."
2,Disappointing,"After cruising in the Pacific NW for the past two years using the Douglass and Hemingway guides and the Waggoner Guide, we were admittedly spoiled. If that's the quality you expect, you won't get it here. On the other hand, we couldn't find an alternative, and this is better than nothing. The harbor diagrams were nice, but there aren't enough of them and what there are don't provide enough detail. The landmarks mentioned in the text often don't appear in the diagrams. We also noticed inaccuracies, but this could be due to time. For example, the fuel dock in Morro Bay wasn't where the guide said it was. However, the woman at the Visitor Information Center also thought it was in the direction indicated in the book. (For others looking for it, it's across from marker 12, not beyond 18.)"
5,Exellent Guide to the Channel Islands,"This is a great guide if you plan on visiting the Channel Islands. As a boater, I will use the information on anchorages and landings to plan my next trips."
3,On the verge of Out of Date,"This book was published in 2002 and should be updated. Contact information is out of date. The book seems more suited to powerboaters than sail. Typical routes suggest passages that are only a couple of miles offshore. Not conservative enough when conditions get bad. I wouldn't rely on this book alone for trip planning, but would use it in combination with updated information and local knowledge."
1,mom of preschooler,Do not like these videos. Not entertaining or engaging enough to hold my 3 year olds attnetion. will need to purchase something else.
4,nice video,I am an ESL teacher with a major in Spanish. I graduated 10 years ago from college and don't use the Spanish language and forgot many words...its sad for me because I love the language. I bought this for my 2 year old daughter and she loves it!!! She wanted me to play it for her nonstop. She loves the kids in the video and the songs. Luckily they have a song section so I dont have to fish thorough the tape to replay it 100 times like she requested. I bought the whole series and am hoping to freshen up my spanish as well. My concern is that I don't think it will make her learn spanish enough to make her bilingual....she will learn some but it cannot replace a teacher or parent who is fluent and unfortunately I am not. I bought books too to read to her in spanish. I read well in spanish but my speaking is not so good. Interaction needed for fluency. Time to start saving to go to Spain.
3,Only Mediocre Basic Language DVD,It wasn't as engaging as I thought it would be. It didn't teach enough simple words/phrases that would begin elementary Spanish learning.
4,BILINGUAL LEARNING VIDEO,"GREAT AND ENTERTAINING FOR NEW SPANISH LEARNERS, MY SON PICKED IT UP FAST, HE IS IN A DUAL LANGUAGE CLASS THAT TEACHES ENGLISH SPEAKERS SPANISH, 90% TAUGHT IN SPANISH ONLY HE IS IN (K), THE DOWN SIDE IS, THAT IT IS NOT LONG ENOUGH AND NEEDS MORE OF THE BASIC SIGHT WORDS ALPHABET, AND VOWELS FOR THE SPANISH LANGUAGE; BUT A GOOD INTRO TO SPANISH DVD ONLY!!"
3,Worth the price,My son really enjoyed this video (compared to the other spanish speaking videos). Although it appears to be a little cheesy it is somewhat catchy and the music captures his attention. I like the repatition of it all and the use of real people.
5,I wish they had whistlefritz for all languages - it's amazing,"This series is super. My almost 3 yr old son has loved all three DVDs since he was 2 & 1/2 and wants to watch them all 3 everyday (we watch them about 3 times a week). This one is his favorite. He now speaks sentences from the DVD and does actions (like pointing to things) so I know he knows what the words mean. He also sings the songs in Spanish. It really is an incredible product -- so thorough with the catchy songs, appealing characters, cute kids, cartoons, translation key in the package, and lots of enthusiasm. I so wish there was a similar product for French & Chinese."
1,"too hard, not enough instruction",this was a waste of money. I cannot believe it has good reviews. No instruction is given. Just starts everything in Spanish. It is easier to relate to if you have English instruction along with the Spanish. Graphics are subpar at best.
5,Great Video,"I wasn't sure what to expect when we ordered this video. There were only a comments about it. However, I am very pleased with this product. It's all in Spanish with no English. It was easy to follow and a great way to learn a lot of words and concepts."
1,Do not buy!,"All of these negative reviews should tell you something! I wish I had bought this at Amazon, so I could've seen these reviews first. They are all correct. There is NO 3D effect at all. In fact, wearing the glasses is a viewing obstruction. We could see the pictures better without them. Also, I don't know if it was my imagination or my frustration, but it seemed that wearing the glasses actually gave me a headache! This would be a much better product if they didn't bother to try to make the images 3D. I too have been looking for slides that will fit into this projector. It wouldn't be bad with plain 2D images."
1,3-D Space Projector,"This projector is just what everyone above has been saying...useless...Do not go and buy it!! I give it ""0"" stars. The negatives are very hard to make out. I couldn't tell if I was looking at Earth or Venus."
1,Absolute GARBAGE,I can't believe that they actually put the word 3-D on the box of this thing. How dare they advertise this as a fun and usefull learning experience. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. There is absolutely NO 3D value to this at all. They should have just made it plain 2D and then it would have been cool.
1,Do not buy Space Projector,We received this as a gift. It is WORTHLESS. There is little or no 3-D effect. The slides are of little interest.
4,This is a great educational toy!,"My son got this for his 5th birthday and he loves it! He likes to turn off the lights and give ""shows"" for the family. We have not listened to the Cds yet but I am sure they are a great add-on. My son is fascinated by space adn this porjector was a cool way for him to learn even more. I don't know if they revamped the design or someting but we love it and have no complaints. In fact, we are going to purchase some of the other packs available."
1,"Don't waste your money,huge disappointment!!",The slides are awful and repetitive.My son had to keep asking me what they were pictures of...and I couldn't even answer him.I think the only thing he liked was when I turned the unit on without any slides and the light projected onto the ceiling.He thought that looked more like a moon that the acual slide did.Huge disappointment!!!And the base of the unit is worthless.
2,Not hot,The radio was never good; the phone was often staticky and the clock has officially died after about a year. Not recommended.
4,Reduces nightstand clutter!,"I ordered this telephone in order to reduce the clutter of a telephone and clock radio on my nightstand. I am very happy with the telephone. The nightlight is fairly bright, but not overly so. The sound quality of the radio is very good, and it has better reception than my normal radio! The one negative is the cord that reaches from the phone to the phone jack was much too short (my phone jack is over 12 feet away from my nightstand). I solved the problem by buying an extension If your phone jack is near your nightstand, you shouldn't have any problem."
1,Poor Visibility,Trying to discern the time or phone number at night or day in the prone position is virtually impossible due to the poor quality of the lighting display . Who wants to get up to read the time or phone number ?? Not me.
1,A glitch in time,"Very dificult to read the LCD screen from most angles. Too easy to accidentally change the time when you are changing the alarm. There are too many buttons to push in order to change any of the clock's settings. Overall, a very poor design. I've had this phone only two months, and I have twice changed the time inadvertantly, causing me to be late for work. I'm seeking a replacement."
2,Don't Buy!,"This software installed perfectly one my computer, but does not work at all! If you are a flight simulator fan, and you want a bigger plane to fly longer distances, buy the airbus a340 or a380, just don't buy this. It does not simulate any realism, nor does it work. To fly autopilot you have to buy another disc from retailer, twice the cost. Something with the lights, won't let you turn them one, and you can not operate any controls that are not on your joystick. I do not suggest buying this product."
4,NOT BAD,"IMO this addon aircraft (ver. 2) from ""Abacus"" is not bad, the only complaint that I have is that is frame rate eater, comparing to other payware aircraft."
1,sound error,"this game is cool graphics wise, but I havent been able to fly my aircraft because everytime i try to turn a knob or touch a button in the cockpit i get a missing sound file error and fsx crashes and resets! does anyone know of a way to fix this?"
3,It was so calm.,"Hes others cd:s have been more ""wild"". It was so calm and i dont like that kind of music.It was quite boring..."
3,"not bad, not great","Artistically, this isn't that great when compared to Antichrist Superstar. Manson's lyrics don't seem as thought provoking or sincere as before. Too bad Reznor wasn't involved, because I think it could have better. I think Manson's too caught up in the glam lifestyle that he's lost the ability to make us think in the way he used to. Yes, it is worth buying but it will never the classic that Antichrist Superstar was."
4,Not what I expected,"First off, I actually expected it to be faster not to mention heavier, but this is still a great CD. Second, I am a Christian and don't agree with much of what Mazza stands for, but this about the music. It took me a while to get into it due to the strange and depressive image that Manson puts across (that does him few favours) but this is a great album. If you don't like because of the music then fine, that's your opinion. But listen to the music before slagging it off. Get over the image and look at the music. Apart from anything the image is all front, not what Brian Warner/Mar1lyn Man5on is really like."
4,its good for techno music,"this isnt near as wierd or good as superstar but its good though, it sounds like garbage (the band i mean), its not heavy at all but its pretty cool though, the only reason that superstar was better was cause trent reznor worked on it, and keep in mind, mr. manson isnt the one who comes up with the riffs or the music, no one ever gives the rest of the band any credit, they do most of the work"
3,A Good Modern Take On Glam Rock,"Mechanical Animals is Marilyn Manson's reckless abandonment of industrial grind for stadium-friendly glam. Strangely enough, Marilyn (the person) fits the role of post-Bowie androgyny like a glove and he belts out apocalyptic attacks on human shallowness. The production is muddled and the songwriting is uneven, but it's an interesting piece of melodrama for the new millennium. Best Tracks: ""Coma White,"" ""Rock Is Dead,"" ""The Dope Show"" Rating: 6/10"
4,Marketing Genius!!!!,"Not since Ozzy Osborne has a performer been able to real in the teen suffering suburban apathy@on such a large scale. Manson must be in his late twenties and has probably come to terms with not fitting in which gives him the ability to step back and really play this shtick perfectly. Saw him in Tokyo and in Toronto and, despite the fact that the shows were identical (right down to his encounter with a roadie on stage) his point about how people in positions of power are more of a danger to others than this glam-rock wanna-be will ever be was made quite clear!"
3,Marilyn Manson Is For Adult Entertainment,"For a long time I resisted this performer. In fact the first time I ever saw him was on the cover of his New book. I couldn't look at it, and to this day still can not look at the photo as it appears on the front. It scares me. I promised after thumbing through a few pages of that book, I would never buy any of his music, art or books. But I got sucked in. He is a poser and admits that. He has mimicked David Bowie, and many other original rock musicians. His name isn't even original and either is his music. But I love his passion. I cannot resist his voice and demeanor, his blatant histrionics and the ways he expresses himself. Agian, he is an entertainer for adults, not children. I still cannot look at his face on the cover of that book though.Kindly, Sera"
2,No Bible thumping...,"I don't want to thump any Bibles and I dont want to kill any dogs. manson is OK..but that is it. some of his songs are good and some suck. Manson is, honestly, trying to get a quick buck with this cd. Oh well...I thought that certain songs were good but manson was just...not convinced enough to wright good music. His older stuff was better. Unless you are a real big hardcore Manson fan, don't get this, it just doesn't sound good enough"
4,A Cash In,"This was a cash in on Antichrist Superstar, featuring the once gothic Manson in glam drag and vampire red hair. It went to number one on the charts its first week of its 1998 release and was again racey for its time. A musically under rated album that has a number of classic tracks like White World, Dope Show and Coma White. Manson was no longer as controversial and had lasting impact on the late 90s and early 2000s popular music scene, as they didn't grow up with heavy metal music. The music itself is a mix of glam rock a la Ziggy Stardust and industrial. Tried to go mainstream but at the expense of most of his audience."
5,damn straight!,"I'm giving this album five stars for the simple reason that MM has managed to upset a very large number of people with the cover art. I even knew a guy who said that he thought it was a real photo! Thus, due to the fact that people are idiots by nature, this album gets a five. The content, on the other hand... well, let's just say that if you want music by a man who craves atttention, stick to Elton John. Much more creative."
5,I of all people actually LIKED this CD,"After reading Manson's Bio ""The Long Road Out of Hell"" I just had to get his CD. I kept wonder which CD to get, the respected and ill-favored ANTICHRIST SUPERSTARS or the one with Manson semi-naked with breasts, no questions about it, this cover was appealing. I've never really heard this guy before, but this was really freaky...I liked the songs, but my parents don't know anything about this CD. I'm a 3.8 GPA female who attends a highly respected prep high school, staff of the school paper, and I of all people listen to a guy w/breasts. Oh well, never hurts to try something new and get screamed at from fanatics about it. But anyways, if you're another goody-2 shoes, GET THIS CD, I'LL CHANGE YOUR WORLD"
4,PUT DISK INTO COMPUTER,PUT THE CD INTO THE COMPUTER.YOU WILL SEE ARTWORK AND A CONTINUING LOOP OF SPOKEN WORD AND MUSIC
4,"an awesome album,but different for manson","i just got this and a few other manson cds today (antichrist superstar,and portrait of an american family).I have had lest we forget for months and loved it, so i had to get more.This cd suprises me.the best song is i dont like the drugs!"
5,Definately his masterpiece,"This is Marilyn Mansons sole masterpiece. Their other albums are good, but this one takes the cake. It's sad that this album will never be topped by them.The combination of John 5 and Jeordie White on this is brilliant. I don't even like Manson himself, I've always just loved the band, but I'll give him credit when its due. I highly recommend this album. My personal favorite is Disassociative. But The Speed of Pain is definately one of the most beautiful songs ever written and having gospel singers in it just makes it even better."
2,"Hmmmm some cool songs, but Antichrist Superstar beat it","Mechanical Animals didn't impress me... I was waiting to some Industrial Rock with a little NIN style but it sounds just like Rock'n Roll. For sure, the Dope Show is great, but it remain the best song of the title... and I don't think that it beats Beautilful People or Tourniquet. Marilyn Manson is a * , everybody knows it, but he does great music. But I don't think that he will do a better job than Antichrist Superstar.... sorry to everyone that love him and his new album."
5,One of the best albums of the 90s,"I bought this album because I like The Dope Show video. I listened to the album and I thought most of the songs were just stupid filler. I was listening to the guitar and they sounded like simple catchy pop riffs.Later on I gave this album a second chance, never did I know that it would consume me and even for a period of time become my favorite album above The Smashing Pumpkin's Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (well...Corgan did consult Manson on this album a bit)This album is epic regarding its sonic landscape of out-of-this-world guitar and synth timbres. This album fits no specific genre, and could have started a new trend in rock music. Hopefully its influence reaches future musicians."
4,"Good Manson, but not the best","This is probably one of manson's least good cds (next to ""Smells like children"") but, never the less, it is a very good cd. My favorite tracks are ""The Speed of Pain"", ""Rock is dead"", ""Coma White"", ""The Last Day on Earth"", and ""Posthuman"". there are no tracks that i do not like, but some i don't chose to listen to. This is, however, a very different kind of Marilyn Manson it is more of a glam rock rather than a shock, hard-core heavy metal that it presented in his recent albums, however, he DID NOT SELL OUT IN THIS ALBUM!!! If you like manson, you should like this album. RECCOMENDED!!! (P.S.- Check out his home videos ""dead to the world"" and ""god is in the t.v.""-they are UNBELIEVABLELY COOL!!!)"
4,MARILYN MANSON RULZ!!!,"I think manson is the all time best mind warper in the world. The music makes you think about life and the world around you. He may be different in appearance but on the inside, he's just more willing to let out what he has to say then anyone else in the world."
4,A healthy dose of intelligent lyricism.,"I still don't really consider myself a Manson fan. I bought the album for ""I don't like the drugs.."", but after spinning it a few times and listening to what the man is saying, I realized that he is human just like the rest of us and has the same feelings. I think that bashing a man simply because you don't like his message is insane. Don't just hear his music, LISTEN to it, then decide if you hate him or his music. I personally feel he is an artist who happens to have an outlet for his art that makes people uncomfortable. If you don't like it, don't buy it. Just don't come down on those who do like it............or the man resonsible."
5,Right to the points,"I guess many know how Marilyn felt when writing this album. My taste doesn't even allow my listening to the noises he made on the last few albums, but this one definitely unleashes a more mature and balanced Manson. Call me mainstream if you will and even though I would rate that as an insult, it won't stop me from liking this album, simply because I can relate. Listen to this stuff. Listen to it long enough to see behind the simple yet effective music. Look for the details and you will see what I mean. Definitely worth checking out."
4,Trip into the mainstream for MM-Good,"That pretty much says it all.With this music he will be going into the musical mainstream.That's not necessarily a bad thing.Its better than some freak in a bra and influencing a young person to wear a tshirt that says ""I am the god of f***""The Dope Show is good but you won't be pleased with the rest of the songs."
5,Manson Has Matured,"In the past, Manson has relied on little more than controversy to sell his music. Without the icon he represented, you had little more than rehashed, run-of-the-mill industrial rock. As a matter of fact, Marilyn's depressing lyrics were pretty much all the band had going for them. But now, the music has made a turn into well-thought out melodies that sprinkle goth into '70's glam rock. Yes, it's been done before, and yes it's music that borrows off of a lot of work by other artists, but this time it's done very well"
4,"Not as good as Anti Christ, but still great music",Manson's new sound is hard to adjust to at first. This new album does not match Anti Christ...I believe that nothing he will do will ever match Anti Christ...but his music is still powerful and amazing. His new look is wonderful. I just want to tell all the other Manson fans out there to give this new album a chance. He is still Manson...and he is still a great musician and shock rocker.
5,One of my favorite albums of all time,This album is a masterpiece. It was expertly produced by Reznor and the band is at the top of their game.This album contains some of the best songs Marilyn Manson ever performed. This is concept album-making at its very best. Everything from the album itself to the packaging obviously had a lot of thought and effort put into it. It comes with a nice booklet that is small but densely populated with pictures and other designs.I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I bought this album brand new from Amazon at a great price. I will probably use Amazon to purchase the remaining albums in the trilogy as soon as I get the money.
5,Lost In Coma,"After the long, chaotic night of Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals is the cold, misty dawn following it. Marilyn has not only broken his hard-worn exterior shell, he's been reborn into his own emotions. This album is a very meaningful, and expressive peice of his life where he stepped out into the cold and flushed the world with sadness. ""It looked like space, and the stars just glittered like a morgue, but then again aren't we all, Mechanical Animals?""....."
5,This c.d rocks,The best c.d and the best singer is Marilyn Manson mechanical animals the whole c.d rocks every song on this c.d rocks I been a fan for about 5 years and this is one of his best one yet seems like every c.d he released keeps gettin better and better marilyn manson 4-eva! And also read my other review for the antichrist superstar the title called marilyn manson keeps gettin better
4,so good that it hurts,"I have to admit that I wasn't convinced when I first heard Mechanical Animals. Then I saw Manson at Brixton, London, UK in December 98 and after seeing, hearing and experiencing Mechanical Animals, I knew I had been wrong. I felt like I had just had my brain operated on using only a flick-knife, a biro and some vodka. Mechanical Animals stamps along, squishing everything in its path, screwing the world into a little tiny ball and throwing it away with a screech. All the people who are criticising it would no doubt also kick up a fuss if it had been the same as Antichrist. Fact: Mechanical Animals is beautiful, painful, raw and powerful. It rocks."
3,Rock is Dead. Manson is Posthuman,"After the acclaimed ""Antichrist Superstar"", Marilyn Manson released this effort that shows a new and perhaps more interesting direction. Not as goth/metal oriented as previous records, ""Mechanical Animals"" delivers a meld of glam rock and electronica, presenting a couple of surprinsingly effective ""ballads"" along the way. Besides the convincing hits ""The Dope Show"", ""Rock id Dead"" and ""Coma White"", this album includes strong songs like the opener ""Great Big White World"", the addictive ""User Friendly"" or the superb and haunting ""The Last Day on Earth"". ""Mechanical Animals"" is a worthwile rock record, offering futuristic soundscapes mixed with some retro moments (there are some 80`s influences at parts). It is also one of Marilyn Manson`s more solid achievements, much more interesting than the band`s most recent efforts.A keeper."
3,I don't get it...,"For a man as outspoken as Marilyn Manson, I never understood why he constantly paraded himself on MTV when this was released. ""Mechanical Animals"" is a decent album at best, going more for melodic, industrial, glam rock sounds than the thrash NIN style on his previous ""Antichrist Superstar"". I love Manson's music, but ""Mechanical Animals"" is such a departure musically it leads one to wonder what Mr. Manson is really all about. Thankfully, he went back to his old self with his recent, and best, ""Holy Wood""."
1,Dissapointment of the Decade,"The title of track 4 sums this up.Rock is dead. Manson shifts from the in your face controversial metal that has accomponied the band since the beginning to more mainstreem,alternative, and Ziggy Stardust inspired music.Marilyn no longer screams.He prefers to try and sing which he fails at miserably.If you like bands that poorly imitate the Smashing Pumpkins then pick this up. Locate Anti-Christ Superstar or Portrait of an American family if you REALLY want a taste of Manson."
1,This is the problem,"If this is the direction rock is going, then I'm jumping off this sinking ship!! The music has no soul, no passion, no life. Marilyn Manson looks like a cheap knock off of all the late 80s hair bands, but they had talent."
3,to mellow for manson,"i though his new cd mechanical animals was not as interesting as the rest. it lacks the punk, glam, goth rock. over all the cd was nothing special."
5,HOT DOG.......This is Good,"WOW, this is a lot better than Antichrist Superstar. I have always been a fan of manson's message and I loved his image but I never thought his music was very special. When I heard The Man That You Fear, I loved it.....it was so different than the rest of his stuff. But when I bought ACS, I found out it was easily the best song. I liked the albums energy, but it was a bit tedious. after the tenth song of screaming and shouting, you wanted variety. Variety is exactly what Mechanical Animals has. It has the energy and roughness of Acs, but also has a gentle side. I think fundamentally lothsome would be a great song for a stripper!!! I never thought Manson would write a good stripper song! This album was also put together in a great way....when things get too soft...it blasts you, and when it gets to loud....it wraps you in a blanket and hugs you. If you like marilyn manson at all, you should buy this album."
2,terrible stuff,"Marilyn Manson didn't have any classic albums, and this one is certainly not any good either. His voice isn't that good, his ability to create a vocal melody is unspectacular, and the entire album sounds like a bunch of nonsense noise to me. Oh sure, some of his lyrics are alright, but everything else on the album fails to impress me. I recommend you check out the more talented, creative, and interesting Alice Cooper (specifically the early version of his band) instead. He's someone who knows how to shock AND please the listener at the same time."
1,what a joke,"'rock is dead.' yeah, and guess who is helping to kill it? that's right, marilyn manson and his brand of kindergarten, no-talent garbage that he apparently doesn't even try to pass off as music. how people like this can make money off of the poor, moronic public is beyond me. wow, how controversial, he has t*ts on the cover. he swears!! oh my GOD!! the devil is coming!! oh, wait, it's just this poser trying to act hardcore and sh*t. music isn't how you LOOK, it's how you SOUND. don't buy this talent-free crap, for once in all of your miserable lives lead, don't follow!! progressive 4 ever."
1,Another one bites the dust.,"I was a pre-antichrist Manson fan. Marilyn Manson was not only an inspiration to me, and a representation of what I myself stood for and believed, even as a preadolescent child, but he was a saviour. I looked to him as the answer to life's most fundamental questions. When I saw the video for the dopeshow in 1998 I became nauseous. I suppose one could hurl invectives at me such as that I had or have no ""life"", or that I am a fool for believing so in another human being, but one must remember that we are all looking for answers, and when you think you find one, and then it's comfort is violently ripped away from you, it's bound to make you pretty sad. It makes me sad. I believe in the transforming powers of the arts. Marilyn Manson was a great human triumph up until Mechanical Animals, it was a big disappointment. This album gets one star for crushing my childhood dreams."
1,a non stop rail way frait train of hardcore rebeliousness,"marilyn manson is so tubular i blacked out the first time i herd this cd , manson is very scary becouse of all his creepyness .you all should watch out or he could beat you up beacouse hes really strong. people who give him bad reviews are just babys, babys are stupid. so watch out all you little babys becouse manson will eat your heart out of chest and make you watch if your not carefull. i hope manson never changes his talent is just smelling of harcore goodness. i know every album will just make me explode powerfull happiness"
5,"The Odd Ball in music, funny and great to listen to","Marilyn Manson is a freak of nature, but his music is pure genious to listen to, which can only be respected if you UNDERSTAND hard rock.If you UNDERSTAND and can APPRECIATE great rock bands, get this CD, other than that, you don't deserve to listen to a master of this form of art."
3,its ok,"its ok i like old manson, but this one isnt that bad he used to be a lot more evil however his first one, portrait of an american family, is a LOT better."
5,Great Work,"Manson has been at the center of controversy because of his image and stage shows, but that aside, this album is really really good! Here, he draws his inspiration from 70s glam rock icons like David Bowie and T Rex, and mixes it with a dash of electronica, to create a distinct and unique sounding album. It's like Led Zeppelin or Alice Cooper updated for the post-grunge 90s, and it's AWESOME! Many of the songs are great, especially ""Great Big White World"", ""Mechanical Animals"", ""Last Day on Earth"", ""Dope Show"", ""Rock is Dead"" and ""New Model no. 15"". True, Manson's lyrics are depressive and pessimistic at times, but he does possess a talent for crafting great rock songs, which we cannot deny him. Many kids listen to this music and take it so personally that they let it consume their lives. What we really need to do is to draw a line between entertainment and reality. Manson is like an artist, and this album is a work of art. Appreciate it but don't emulate it."
3,"OVERALL, NOT TOO BAD","This is the first manson cd that has expressed any musical capability. The songs are a lot more spaced out and melodic and for the first time they've given up that whole ""goth"" thing (good move, that image was never gona last). Allthough the lyrics are still more angst ridden than a Alanis Morrisett cd, and the guys voice is like a frog, the album is fairly catchy, with songs like ""The Dope Show"" and ""Rock is Dead"". Also surprisingly manson's managed to come up with some half way decent slow songs as well(coma white & last day on earth). I belive manson's style now tends toward a David Bowie-ish area. If anyones intrested this albums out there, but take my word for it, the ""goths"" will be disapointed."
4,Very Good,"I'll admit it, I was never a Marilyn Manson fan. Antichrist Superstar had about two good songs on it. I then heard some clips of some songs off Mechanical Animals, and immediately bought the CD. It's very different from the last one, and it's very good. Plus, it's packaging is unique, with hidden stuff inside the booklet."
4,Excellent New Era,"This new Era Manson got into was very strange apart from the Antichrist era. This album ""Mechanical Animals"" is an awsome new start. It's not as good as Antichrist , but it has a more electronic sound to it .I was dissapointed that the former guitarist Zim Zum had left . Zim is awsome on this album , John5 only did this album live . Besides John5 is just stupid."
4,GREAT LYRICS,"This is probably my favorite manson cd. fantastic lyrics. Theres some really great songs...a good mix , a few are slower paced, a few fast paced, and then some hard bangin ones. l definitley recommend it."
5,mechanical animals: art's back in rock,"Long live the poseur consummate!...at last an artist comes along who shamelessley promotes his craft with passion and a healthy disregard for the forces of consevatism and boredom. This has got to be one of the most catchy, original and brazen recordings of the 1990's with some beautiful photography of the band in all their neo-glam glory. The song content is strong and well-produced, any track on the album being capable of becoming a single. Manson's voice ranges from the Antichrist-croak to the sensitive croonings of 'The Speed Of Pain'. The keyboard work is clean, futuristic and fluidic while guitar riffs pack each track out as an anthem to all of those people who are unashamed to be beautiful, unconcerned with society's permission, and who love solid rock tunes."
5,Tasty!,"Although I am a fan of a little harder music (AntiChrist Superstar was excellent) This is a great album. Very different from earlier work but still excellent.All the close minded people, try using that brain for yourself, you may find this album enjoyable."
3,Not Penelope's Best,"While a well written book, it doesn't capture your heart the way that her other works do. The descriptions that I have read on this book really don't paint the correct picture of the story. While he was devoted to the steam locomotive, Ms. Williamson doesn't show how devoted he was or how he was torn between the woman and his dream. There's too much else going on for you to really get a handle on this relationship. Also, there was no depth to the female lead character. The story picks up five years later and she still seems to be the same naive and clumsy young girl at 21 that she was at 16. Heart of the West and The Outsider are by far Penelope Williamson's best work."
1,hated the story,"I loved the passions of Emma, so I've tried this book. However, I couldn't even finish it. It was one of the worst stories ever."
5,Wonderful!,"Powerful, heart breaking and passionate are just a few words to describe this wonderful story. This is a must read for any avid romance novel reader."
5,One of the best romance novels that I have read in a long time!,"Every once in a while a book comes along that just grabs you from beginning to end, it entices you and makes you never want to put it down. This is one such book. The moment that I read the summary of the book on the back I was hooked. Immediately I started reading it, and I never wanted it to end. It was just that great. From beginning to end it keeps you on your toes, and characters Jessalyn and McCady will make you both want to scream and cry. It's a romance that seems like it is never gonna come to pass. It keeps you wishing, and it also breaks your heart. I recommend this book very highly."
3,Siding and Eaves Brush,"I recently ordered the Carrand 97210 Siding and Eaves Brush. There are some things that I like about the brush, one being that the water shut off valve really stops the water from going to the brush head. The brush head is soft and works well on log siding as far as cleaning it. The length of the handle is good, although the places where you extend it (pole extension joints) leak somewhat when the water is going to the brush head. I would rate this brush as OK. The brush as with everything I get from Amazon came quickly."
4,The Walls crashed,"This book was very inspirational to me. Before 1966 there was a myth that five African-American couldn't play on the basketball court together without having one white person on the court to keep things in order. This championship game of 1966 with five African-American's starting as well as winning the game busted integration wide open. If minorities as a whole can apply the same techniques to academics that they apply athletics, we as a race will be able to tear down many racial barriers whether we have affirmative action or not. Just look at the blacks that are in big time positions that are not athletes. Kenneth Chenault/CEO American Express, Frankie Raines/CEO of Fannie Mae, etc."
4,"cute, but small","It is very pretty, as described, but a little small, good thing my ringbearer is a just 6 years old."
5,A very fine movie until the last 20 to 30 minutes when it slows down,"Has enough punch packed in the movie that makes it watch worthy more than once. Definitely good performances from ranbir, Katrina and other members of the cast."
3,Interesting theories but...,This book has some interesting theories and stories but it's very technical. That part bored me rather quickly because I'm not a scientist so a lot of it was over my head. The parts that are not so technical...documented stories are VERY interesting and I'm glad I read the book just for those. So if you are not technically minded then I suggest you not give youself a headache by trying to understand stuff in this book but rather be willing to skip to the good parts.
2,For Abolute Beginners,"This book is not a manual. It is consisted of a collection of stories and articles about possible time travel incidents, such as the Philadelphia experiment and other like occurrences: no new information.If you already have some understanding of how the relativity theory of a space-time continuum replaces the Newtonian concept of an absolute time and space, then this book is not for you. It is for people who want to acquire this knowledge. It is for beginners.So, unless you are an absolute beginner to new science, do not waste your time and money on this book.I do laud the editor for his effort nonetheless."
2,Not the best of the bunch,"I have about a dozen books on time travel, so when I saw that this was the actual ""handbook"" I thought I'd check it out. Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems with it. Most of the time it seems like book is simply trying to SOUND intelligent, without actually achieving that. It actually REPEATS entire sections that you've already read underneath pictures describing (poorly) what you've already read. There are certainly interesting sections of this book, but nothing you can't find elsewhere in a more cohesive manner."
2,Too many animals,"Aesop's fables are interesting, but I wouldn't try to read too many of them at once. I am currently reading this edition of Aesop's fables. If I have to read any more animal stories, I may have to pick up a copy of ""Final Exit."" The author's notes, however, make this edition almost worth the time."
3,disappointing presentation,"While this opus may be complete, it disappoints the reader. The joyful flavor of Aesop's work is entirely lost--in favor of erudite footnotes treating inflections of unusual ancient Greek nouns and what-not. David Levine's work, by way of comparison, may only present 120 or so fables, but they are deftly and cheerfully conveyed, and the accompanying cartoons leave you with a palpable sense of satisfaction and of having learned something significant. Penguin leaves us only with a palpable sense of having slogged through 300+ mundane textual exercises."
4,very well written. and very entertaining,this book is much better than dragonspell. u learn a lot more about the main characters. there are a few goods twists that i didnt see coming. i think the story line is a little weak but thats my only complaint and when i say little i mean very little. overall it is worth reading if u emjoyed dragonspell
4,An astronomical improvement over the first book,"DragonQuest is to DragonSpell what ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is to ""The Sorcerer's Stone.""Donita K. Paul's writing has matured tremendously since her first foray into her world of Amara. The characters are amazingly diverse and well written.In Dragonspell, I only found Dar and Kale likeable and sympathetic. In Dragonquest, it would be hard to find someone you can't understand and sympathize with.The addition of Toopka and Lyll are especially good.When all is said and done, the book is a solid one and a good read. The characters make the story better than it would be without them. I look forward to the sequel."
1,Holy Living Jeremy Taylor,This book literally fell apart the first time I read it. I will not be doing business with Amazon in the future. I also bought textbooks from Amazon recently and continue to get hit with charges on my VISA which appear to be random. I am not impressed with Amazon at all. I will actively discourage people from using Amazon to purchase books.Al Geiger
4,A party at an aquarium leads to murder.,"Carnegie Kincaid is planning the wedding of two of her on again off again boyfriend's coworkers. At the moment it is off. At a party at the aquarium, a bridesmaid is murdered and the best man assaulted. Another bridesmaid is allegedly pushed off the pier. The murdered bridesmaid had just hired Carnegie to arrange her wedding to the owner of the newspaper and mayoral candidate, Talbot. Over everyone's protests Carnegie investigates.I enjoyed this novel, but I was a little confused by the relationship between Aaron and Carnegie, and I just didn't feel much sympathy for any of the characters except Tommy. It was a good mystery though, and I read it through in one sitting."
2,Can do better elsewhere.,"As someone who had used a lot of the other exam prep and exam cram materials (mostly exam cram) I was hoping for the same quality materials but the book really comes up short and misses covering material in detail that you'll need to know for the test. If you liked the other books in this series, you'll be very dissappointed. The authors seem to have forgotten who their target audience is and waste a great deal of time explaining basic material covered in prior certification information. The book would be half the size if they would bring the level of discussion up several notches. The SYBEX study guide is much better and the exam cram is probably more worthy of reading than exam prep."
1,Do not buy this book,I am an MCSE and like many people have never bothered to write a review... but this time I felt I had to - this book wasted too much of my time. The material covered is not close to the test - the test and review questions in the book (which you will score high in if you read the book) are in NO WAY related to the Microsoft test of Proxy Server 2 and are repetitive and contradict other chapters in the book. On the other hand the Transender Exam questions are spot on - if not a little expensive... I will never buy another book by Exam Prep/Cram or any of these authors
1,THE WORST BOOK ON THE MARKET!,"First, I would like to say to the author... I Hate You. You are a horror of a man and you should have your hands removed so that you never defile the earth with another abomination such as this. If you read this book you will be terrified of Proxy Server and you will walk away knowing less than you did prior to reading it. It is completely confusing and incoherent. This book only makes since to the author."
5,great toy,"Helps develop spatial perception and fine motorics. It presents right amount of challenge: the child has to put some effort into assembling, but not enough to discourage him/her. The pieces are of the right size too."
4,Kaleido Gears Review,"Originally purchased for our 5 year-old granddaughter, this toy is a little above her developmental stage, and apparently above her grandparents as well! She and we became frustrated in trying to fit the white gear connectors to the gear pieces, and then attaching the coupled piece onto the frame. Our 8 and 11 year-old granddaughters, however, love it and fight over playing with it!"
5,great learning toy,I purchased this toy for my three year old daughter. She loves it. The gears come with a base that connect together like a puzzle and the toy teaches kids about motion. This is a toy that both kids and parents can enjoy!
3,"Bit tough for little hands to put together, but beautiful...","The base pieces of this toy are a bit stiff for my kids' little hands to put together. Also, the pegs that hold the gears onto the base are a bit tricky, but will build good fine motor skills if not discarded in frustration. I was just as entranced by this toy as they were as we played with it together for the first time. The brightly colored decals are trippy and fun. And learning that gears transfer energy they supply to move other gears of various sizes ""on down the line"" is... priceless. *grin*"
1,Item looks nothing like what is pictured.,"Buyer beware - the item pictured is for an older 52 piece version, NOT the 55 piece version which is being sold here through Amazon. Personally, I find the newer version much less attractive and as such I am returning the item."
4,A Nice Addition/Alternative to the Legos,"My Grand-son already has plenty of Legos, and recieved several more sets this Christmas, so I wanted to give him something similar, but perhaps a bit more advanced. I'm still waiting to hear from them about his reaction."
2,not really fun,interesting. looks cool. but not all that exciting. i think i should have gotten the one that you can build into towers. much more interactive.
2,eh,They were really fun for a month and then the pegs on the white pieces that snap the gears into the boards starting breaking off. :(
4,crazy eyes,Georello is good for students. I teach speech/lang and they loved to put together after sounds are worked on. Great for taking turns and working together.
1,"Difficult for parents, impossible for child","I bought this for my 4 yr old grandson and I am very, very disappointed in this item. The parts are very difficult for an adult to assemble and virtually impossible for a child to enjoy alone. The box did not contain any instructions to help in the management of the activity. By the time an adult gets any of the parts together so the child can see the gears interact, any child will have lost interest."
2,too complicated for many kids,This toy looks like fun but is very frustrating for the kids with whom I work. First it requires that you put the base together which is quite difficult for little hands. Then you have to put the gears on the top and that requires advanced planning that is far too advanced for little ones until they are well into elementary school. I presented it to several different kids of different ages and stages and it was not something that any asked to try again.
4,Great toy!,My Grandson enjoys this toy so much. It is one of his favorites. He is so fascinated by the gears and their movement and will play with this for hours.
1,kaleido gears,"Child almost 3, does not hold her interest at all The bottom puzzle like pieces come apart as the gears spin."
5,It's Jeff Buckley reincarnated!,"I was listening to KEXP in Seattle the other day, and the most beautiful song started playing. I thought that Jeff Buckley had risen from his grave. As the song ended, the DJ said it was Nicolai Dunger from Sweden. I was intrigued. The soaring vocals were so beautiful, along with the simple and gorgeous guitar backing. The song I heard was White Wild Horses (the little snippet of music on Amazon doesn't even include the amazing vocals on this song). I bought the album just to hear this song, and the rest of the album is great too!I would highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates powerful vocals and beautiful melodies. I hope he tours soon and comes to Seattle!!"
2,Lacking in depth,"I found this book disappointing. The characters were too simple and the story too fairy-tale. Jake is simply rotten, Nan is simply perfect, Ben is a perfect gentleman... everyone seemed very one-sided. Girl meets boy and they are ""deeply in love"" within a couple of days, she has the money and support to leave her bad marriage and move straight into ""perfect"" love - a little too Harlequin romance-ish."
4,From someone in the know.,"""The Tattooed Wolf"" begins as a 'tail' of divorce and betrayl, and ends as a triumph of the human spirit, no matter what form.Dan Sullivan tells his story to a lawyer he wishes to hire.As the story progresses, we learn that lycanthropy is the least of Dans' problems, as his new wife attempts to kill him on two occasions, in a callous move to receive his monies as his widow.Dan weaves his tale through his childhood experiences as a werewolf, through to his early adulthood as a reclusive manuscript restorer.His marriage proves a catastrophy, and as the blurb on the back of the book so aptly puts, ""even the fairest face can hide a monster.""Werewolfism aside, this book gives you a good look at the 'human' condition, ranging from desire to greed to pure love.I'd happily recommend this book.I'd happily read any other books this first time author puts forth."
2,Fancy way to put words together do not always make a good naval book,"This is the third book in this series that I start and then give up on reading,it's hardly a seafaring book yet again, which I thought it was supposed to be, I've read about 100 more books in the genre,loved most of them, and was expecting a lot of the usual suspense build-up and sea action, but instead I had to read through 200 pages of rambling about completely irrelevant description of events and characters on land, not to mention that nothing really happened either, if there is a story in this book, it must be developing towards the end, but I got no patience to read any further, sorry O'brian, even Dudley Pope hasn't bored me this much....."
4,My Rieiew,I found the book pleasure to my reading senses. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to turn to the next page. This is by far the best of the Aubrey series.I found Doctor Stephen character very entertaining if I was a character in a book I would like to be him he is smart and sophisticated can do complicated math in his head in short time I really enjoyed the way O'Brian portrayed this character.I really loved the way that the vocabulary of the book fits in with each character it is very enjoyable to read. When I read this book and I finish I just want to read it again and again.This book really shows how life would be upon a real Man of War vessel it is amazing and how they were punished and taken care of liked being dragged the length of the ship. I would recommend this book to any one who enjoys a great novel.
2,"Ho-hum, sea-shanty","The continuing story of the exploits of Aubery and Maturin.A mixture of derring-do, and unrequited romance and high seas.I like the story, however I feel that the fact that there is a series of stories perhaps devalues each individual story. I also would like to be sure that the action parts are based on some reality - the enthusiasts for the series say that it is, and the writing has a realistic historical flavour; however the 'top-gallants a lee, bring 'er about, nicely lads' stuff could just as easily be gobbledook for all I know.As a true son of Erin, I am quite happy with the reversal of usual stereotype - to have the English partner (Aubery) as a bluff, rash, unreflective type, and the Irish (or Catalan) type as reserved, intellectual, reflective but deadly.p.s. this one also has requited and unrequited long distance love, perhaps to interest the Signoritas."
2,Not the best of Mitchum,"I watched about 1/2 this movie and then stopped as I had lost interest in it. Bad plot, so,so acting and just not up to the other Bob Mitchum movies over the years. A lot of good westerns were made in this time period ,but this is not one of them. Save your time and money on something else like ""Blood On The Moon""."
5,Ikaruga raped my mind...,"This game is hard. Prepare to have your brain raped and eyeballs spanked. If you love old-school twitch goodness that puts hair on your chest, buy this game, take it home, and be abused by gameplay. This game serves as a lesson to all you casual gamers (who I hate SO MUCH,) as to what a real gamer looks like. 3D graphics and exploration is great, (however, sports games are inexcusable...) but every once in a while, you need to bring it all back home. Take my advice, if you want your kids to grow up knowing what a VIDEO GAME!, (not a video game, but a VIDEO GAME!) looks like, then force them to play this along with all those great SNES games. It's a good thing."
4,Incredibly hard and clever shmup,"This is an absolute must for any shmup fan. The twist here is that there is two colors of enemies; white and black. You can switch the color of your own ship to alternate between these two colors, which lets you absorb the bullets of the color you are in order to build up your special attack. It is an extremely hard game. I've read that there is only 5 levels but so far I could not even make it through the third. There is a lot of challenge and sometimes there is so much bullets in the screen that your eyes hallucinate and your brain almost switch off. Only for the most hardcores."
4,"Sweet game, nice difficulty","Been hooked on this game for years. Needed a new copy because I lost mine a year or so ago. Nice system for a shooter, lots of enemies and big bosses"
4,WOW,simply put... amazingclassical format with graphics ahead of its time and a few new suprises in gameplaya true diamond
1,Stop Murder Music,"Beenie Man's music encourages people to kill gays. More than 30 gays have been killed in Jamaica, where he comes from. His music has lots of influence there. In some cases mobs sang his anti-gay songs while they killed a black man, who might have been gay. The right of ""free speech"" is limited by criminal laws on ""incitement to violence"", but the boundary is fuzzy. When asked to apologize and change his ways, Beenie Man wrote a song about how he would not apologize (""No Apology"", 2005). All that is necessary for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing. I suspect that the world would not ""do nothing"" if white men were getting killed. Please think about who you want to support with your money."
2,Dire Straits' Most Boring Album,"This was Dire Straits' second album and is the weakest of all their albums. This album only has like 2 good songs, Where Do You Think You're Going', and 'Lady Writer'. Rest of it is BORING.Buy it anyway if you want to be a Dire Straits collector."
2,Lady Writer Is The Best By Them,I really dont like this album!! The only good song on thisalbum is Lady Writer. Also another good song is Where DoYou Think You're Going?. Better off with DS Debut album.I'll give this CD 2 stars because I like Lady Writer andit is one of the best by them.
2,WEEK!!!!!,"This album is just the same as Brothers in Arms, very week.But Brothers in Arms is ranked better because it has atleast4 of 5 songs that rock. This album only has 2 good songs,Lady Writer is the best song on this thing."
3,Classic Dire Straits,"Whilst this is not my favourite album of this classic band it is still better than probably ninety percent of the other albums by other groups on the market in my opinion. This remastering of the original album has been done with skill and consideration of the feel of this album. The tracks ""Lady Writer"" and ""Portobello Belle"" are my favourite tracks on this album. Worth a serious listen."
3,Communique- More or Less,I tihnk the old and remasterized records prevent we hear the pure sound. But it's normal for this kind of records.. Unfortunatelly the technollogy avaiable fo this moment was not the best for records. That's is alll.
5,Early Dire Straits Were The Best,"I'm a fan of Dire Straits, and I thought their first two albums were their best, and this is their second album. It sounds completely different then the current work of Mark Knopfler's solo material. Dire Straits isn't really in the same category of a traditional rock band, but it isn't folk music which Mark Knopfler sounds like in his current work. It's hard to categorize Dire Straits, but that's why I like them, and their second album Communique is highly recommended if you like their first."
2,Inessential,"Interesting to see so much love for this; I find it sluggish, derivative of the debut, inessential, a sophomore slump. Still, it sounds pretty good and can be a pleasant listen if one doesn't concentrate too hard. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a promising start, one of the better tracks, with Knopfler's sardonic writing in force, ""Sitting on the fence, that's a dangerous course/ You could even catch a bullet from the peace-keeping force,"" but ""News"" stutters and ""Where Do You Think You're Going"" gets going only in the last minute. From ""Communique"", the album mellows a bit, and with a hint of flamenco and a hint of funk and the title track is a nice tune, though far from truly vital. The single, ""Lady Writer"" is rehashed Sultans of Swing, but a catchy song for all that, and so on...the songs taken on their own are just fine, but the sum is considerably less than its parts."
1,Lady Writer is the only good song.,"Maybe in my opinion this is the lamest Dire Straits album yet by Brothers in Arms. I am a huge Dire Straits / Mark Knopfler fan.But this only has 1 good song, Lady Writer. The rest of the songs are BORING! Not their best."
2,boring,"this album is boring! not many of these songs were that great!!best songs:where do you think your going, lady writer, portobello bellebuy dire straits, making movies, & love over gold insted."
2,Dire Straits' Weakest.,This is Dire Straits' second album and is the weakest of all tHEIR ALBUMS along with Alchemy and BBC. This one only has 1 in Lady Writer which is great. But still worth to buy even though it's the weakest.
4,Some good songs -- but not their best,"Dire Straits in its early years was a rock guitar band highlighting Mark Knopfler's exquisite, rapid-fire guitar licks and off-beat, Dylanesque lyrics. ""Communique"" is similar but not as good as Dire Straits' exceptionally good first album. Two songs rise above the mundane to get to the almost-great category: ""Angel of Mercy"" and ""Portobello Belle,"" a catchy little number with a honky-tonk piano in the foreground and Knopfler's guitar taking a back-bench for a change.""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is also a good tune with a loping Reggae-like beat, but I prefer the live version on ""Alchemy"" to this studio version. As a whole, ""Communique"" is a bit too laid back and unexciting to get a top rating--but I could listen to ""Portobello Belle"" all day long."
5,"Excellent, as always","I can't give an objective review of a Dire Straits recording, I think they're all great. This was the only one I didn't have, and I held back because some cornball in an earlier review said that you couldn't play it on your computer. That's totally wrong. I convert all of my CD's to MP3 format and play them on my computer, and I had no trouble converting this one.As far as the style of the music goes, I would compare it to their first CD, rather than the later ones. It is a conservative effort, but definitely worth listening to."
5,Read the Preface,"This was my introduction to Tao. and Mr.Smullion. I loved the book ,have re-read it untill the pages are mostly loosened from the binding. I truely and deeply appreciated the tongue-in-cheek attitude. Don't you think ""God"" has a sense of humor? I believe he does. W.E.M."
5,A celebration of the irony & paradox of life along the Way.,"As a long time student of the Tao I absolutely loved this book. It truly embodies the spirit of Taoism. It models for the reader a delightful mixing of pleasant and unpleasant realities of life in a fashion that comes to terms in a manner of peaceful coexistence. Removing the unnecessary labels of such things as good and bad leading the ready reader to accept things as they are. I especially enjoyed the invaluable lessons that illustrate the power of perspective.As the Tao itself, Schulman's book offers the novice as well as the master greater levels of insight and inspiration with each read. A true celebration of the irony and paradox of life along the Way. Schulman doesn't fall prey to the folly of teaching; he merely (ironic grin) shares and knows that the student who is ready will learn and understand. Bravo!"
3,The I and the Dao,"Raymond Smullyan's response to Dao is to run it through an interpretative process. Okay: that is of interest. If this can be called writing that is inspired by Dao, so be it. This is what it is for him, Smullyan's being as he is. It seems to me, though, that writing that is even more inspiringly inspired by Dao would be writing that leaves the pages blank. For example:Dreaming Zhuangzi"
3,A great library book.,"I bought this book, read it, enjoyed it and will reread it but I wish I hadn't. Living in Taiwan I end up buying a lot of books that should stay in the library and this is one of them. A funny and thought provoking book that I didn't need to own.Check it out at a library yourself and see how you feel."
1,THIS BOOK MADE ME ILL>,"I made the mistake of reading this book cover to cover. I was hoping for one iota of spiritual insight or possibly a tale of his own personal satori, unfortunately there was neither, I found this book to be extremely ""western"" . It offered none of the insight or wisdom of the Taoist teachings, and was mostly just page after page of an author trying to summarise his personal ""path"" toward oneness. The overall Ideological basis in this book seems to be around zen, which is good in itself but is not the same as taoism. If this were the first book I had read on taoism I would have ceased to study it alltogether. this book was four hours of my life down the tubes. In conclusion, If the book was not intended to represent taoism I would be inclined to give more stars, but as of my current personal oppinion ,..i would give negative stars if at all posible. my appologies to the author."
5,the fifth book....,"How can no one have mentioned that there is a fifth novel to the series, called "" The Other Wind"" . It is amazing book that once again broadens the scope of the series and the understandings of life, death and everything else. I think the original trilogy is pretty good, but with the additions of tehanu, tales from earthsea and the other wind, the series becomes one of my alltime favorites.I don't understand why this was released as a quartet, other than that including the fifth book would have made it too big..."
2,Did not live up,"On a recommendation and upon seeing the other reviews on amazon, I was hoping for the ""classic"" that had been described. However, these four stories continually declined in quality and originality. Although I have grown accustomed to the new fantasy that is being written, what was once deemed a classic simply follows a prodigal wizard who first must face a ""dark"" enemy, then subsequently we see three stories with little enemy development or self development. While the fourth does try to tie up the main characters, it too shows little emotional that can tie us to the characters. Look towards a different series if you are looking for a good fantasy read."
4,It would be nice to see them all in person....,"This is a very interesting and informative collection of historical stories about varying pictures and statues of our Blessed Mother that have exhibited miraculous actions and effects. The history alone is fascinating, and the miracles associated with each icon underscore the beauty and power of our Blessed Mother. Each item is roughly four to five pages in length, which provides plenty of detail without being overly verbose."
5,Lord of the Ring bliack riders booster box,"The Black riders booster box is a pretty nice addition to any LOTR TCG deck, especially my pretty mean Nazgul deck. Not too bad of a price here on amazon."
5,"Of all the sauces I own, this is my favorite HOT HOT sauce","I find the best way to rate hot sauces on heat is to compare them to other sauces. This is just slightly hotter than Dave's Insanity Sauce, but slightly less heat than Mad Dog Inferno. It is way hotter than any tobaso product. If tobaso is the only hot sauce you have eaten, I would suggest eating something more mild than Blair's. Sudden Death will give a good burn to just about anyone but the most serious chili heads.What I like about this sauce the most is the flavor. It is very good. Unlike some of the extract sauces which lack flavor, I found this one to taste very good. And it has the heat kick that many of the better tasting sauces do not have."
2,"It's hot, and it's good with the right meal","The first time I tried this sauce, I thought it was Blair's After Death, but only hotter. For those not familiar with Blair's After Death, it's basically Blair's Original Death with a small amount of extra for extra heat but does not taste like an extract sauce. It still maintains the Original Death flavor.However, after using this sauce on more items, I learned it really wasn't a hotter version of After Death. The ginseng flavor comes through strongly when enough is used. It's still very good on a burger mixed with ketchup, good mixed with BBQ sauce on chicken or anything that uses soy sauce really, and passable on rice, but if you use enough, the chemically Ginseng flavor can wreck some dishes too.I would recommend this for those who would only use a drop or two at a time. In that case, this is still a very good sauce. But for those who use a good amount, I would suggest Blair's After Death or even the hotter Mega Death instead."
2,Dissapointing port,MGS1 which was ported to PC by Microsoft was a classic and I instantly became a fan of Solid Snake. I wish I could say the same for the sequel. The game is actually a direct port of Xbox version and suffers from poor optimization for the PC. The game runs poorly even on my Pentium 3Ghz with 512MB Ram and GeForce FX 5800 rig. The settings need to be turned down to the lowest for the game to run satisfactorily and there are still significant slowdowns. I just hope Konami is working on a patch to optimize it.
4,Classic Gameplay,"I originally played MGS on the PS1 when it first came out and was impressed by the massive cut scenes, great plot and intuitive (to me at least) controls. Feeling a bit nostalgic, I decided to get MGS2 for my PC. I wasn't disappointed. It was great to return to MGS and I found I enjoyed this version of the game as much as the first. While the cut scenes and graphics don't stack up against more modern games, such as Splinter Cell 4, I still found myself thoroughly absorbed in the gameplay.Good effort Konami!"
5,Just what I ordered!,Just what I ordered! I had trouble when I first started the game because the character in the first cut scene was a white silhouette. I adjusted some video settings and everything worked out fine.
2,Metal Gear Solid 2,"I wanted to get this game for my PC. I guess I should have done a bit more research on it. Unfortunately, this game has been ""ported"" to different formats, making it rather incompatible with PC. Originally designed for PS2, it was then ported to XBOX, i think, then to PC. The console interface was still built for PS2, which was useless. So, I got a logitech game controller and tried to configure it. Still useless. I got tired of trying to remap the buttons, so I have given up, for now. The actual game is awesome, though, but in its current PC settup, completely worthless."
4,The good and bad of MGS2 substance,"The game was very cool. Raiden, I thought, was just a pretty boy, but as I played as him, it seemed I pegged him a bit wrong. The problem is that there is too many cut scenes.""Raiden, stop it!""Raiden, stay cool!""Raiden, call back""I'm PREGNANT!!!""IT DRIVES ME NUTS!The game itself is very good, but the controls are horrible unlesss oyu have a controller that's like a PS2 Controller or a PS2 controller with an adaptoid.Pros:Good story line. Extra features will keep you busy for a long time.Cons:Keyboard controls are useless. takes up 7.9 GB (7.9!!! GB!) luckily, it can be installed for just for 3.6 or so GB.Overall, I give it 4 stars."
1,What the???,I have tried installing this game on 3 different machines with 3 different graphical setups. No luck at all because im only C-in black. I played the old ps1 game for day's on end and if it's anything like that it will be awesome....But i guess i will never know...........
5,Sound fixes...,"If you have staticy/glitchy sound in MGS2S for the PC:1. Install the latest patch. (As above!)2. Go to ""Sound"" in Control Panel.3. Click the ""Advanced"" button in the ""Speaker settings"" box.4. Click the ""Performance"" tab.5. Lower your ""Hardware acceleration"" slider by one notch.6. Try the game and it should sound fine now!7. If you still have problems, try lowering it more."
5,passport lynard,This is what I was looking for a place for everything. And everything has a place.I can hold all the things I need when on a cruise.
2,Little more than you can find in their previous and bad typographical expression,"The book is fundamentally equal to the previous book from the same authors titled ""Service Profit Chain"" (often with the same examples!). New stuff about Strategic management is not incisive as the well defined concepts in Service Profit Chain.Contents: 3 starsTypographic expression: 1 star (bad structuring, no cross index to merge different aspects of same topic or different topics related to the same objective)"
3,"Informative, but...","incredibly boring. The book's ideas are great, but the vocabulary and the way they wrote the book puts you to sleep. I bought this book for one of my management classes, and even the teacher agrees that this book in boring. Good ideas, though!"
5,A new and highly recommended interpretative survey.,"This new interpretive history of the American west is recommended reading for college-level students of American history. Drawings, posters, photos and illustrations pepper what remains a panoramic view of history and characters which succeeds in documenting some of the major trends and personalities of the West. Highly recommended."
1,The American West: A New Interpretive History (The Lamar Series in Western History) by John Mack,This book is painfully flawed in it's NEW interpretation. Look elsewhere for history because hollywood has had it's way by the hand of two incompetent authors who know not how to read and tell history.
5,Could not be any better!,This vest jacket is one high quality piece. It is super light and very warm without any bulk between the seams. It feels flat like an ordinary jacket would! The cool green color gets many compliments and this thing is definitely true to size. Highly recommended for those who like a lot more freedom of movement. Buy it!! :)
3,Price?,It is no worth the price. Very thin. Have found much heavier and warmer for far less. It did arrive on schedule. And is a great color.
3,compromise,"warm, and very light. Easily packs to minimal size. However it is not very durable...wear it to the office it won't hold up to the woods."
2,Too small,The arm holes are way too small. It looks and feels cheap. The one good thing is that it is thin enough to wear under a dress coat.
3,A review of the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa and her reign,"Maria Theresa reign was a stabilization and renewal time for the Austrian Hungarian Empire. Upon her beginning of the reign, the Empire was confronted by the War of Austrian Succession. This brave woman guided the Empire through very difficult times, and renewed it by organizing the finances and administration. Her progress made way for her more dynamic son's reforms.The book gives only sketches of this great Empress. Various aticles from family, contemporaries, and historians reflect on her reign. Among the articles are two from future Emperors Joseph and Leopold, King Frederick the Great, and Robert Kann. The book could have provided more information about this great lady."
4,Pauly Shore,"The movie came quickly. With in 4 days of ordering. Case and DVD were in great shape.BUT The movie was aweful. I like Pauly Shore and thought it would be funny, but it is not. It is so stupid."
3,Painful to watch,"If you thought Pauly Shore's life was sad from watching his TBS series ""Who's Minding the Store?"" then you'll be reduced to tears after watching this movie. I'm giving it three stars because he does have that gifted ability to be funny. The beginning with Charlie Sheen is dead on with its ""candid"" humor. After that, it just drags. Only see if you really care about Pauly Shore, or if you are drunk."
1,Not worth you're time,"I did not like anything about this movie. I did not go into it expecting much except that I read the back of the movie and thought it would be good, I even read reviews and thought maybe it has something I like pauly shore and have seen him in numerous movies but because this was different I thought it would be good. I was let down allot it brought nothing what so ever, I don't even think the acting if that is what you call it was good. The reviews that say it was a good movie may deffinatly let you down because that is what it did to me. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! it is not worth your time."
2,"Great idea, terrible production","This would have worked much better if Pauly had someone get reactions from celebrities (even fake ones) from the red carpet. But he didn't.Instead Pauly produces a lame, laughless series of scenes featuring ""himself"" and other semi-celebs being ""Not-Funny"". althought he scene with Carrot Top buying Pauly's house is pretty funny.Overall the film falls flat trying to be both surreal and funny, leaving the viewer saying, ""What?"" a lot."
1,Helpful Advice,"If you are forced to watch this movie, imagine that the Pauly Shore masturbation scenes are meant as a clever comment on the movie itself. There is little other hope for preserving your sanity."
4,Give Pauly Credit,"I think Pauly Shore is much more talented then people give him credit for. It is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films. But the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made. Frankly I dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career, I think he probably knows that he is a living joke, I feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and I'd say hes done that."
3,"Not the author's best, but it was okay.","Quiet, humble math professor meets gorgeous and exciting author Valentina.CAUTION SPOILER:They have a great weekend together but afterwards they each think the other doesn't want to continue the relationship. This is one of my pet peeves: where conflict is created from vague communication and inaccurate assumptions. Other than that it was a nice story with some good sex scenes and a fulfilling ending.DATA:Sexual language: erotic. Number of sex scenes: twelve. Setting: present day Scotland. Copyright: 2001. Genre: erotic contemporary romance.This short story is also published in the anthology The Best of Jaid Black.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Jaid Black books, see my 5 star review of One Dark Night."
2,I COULD HAVE DIED!!!,"I couldn't believe this video wasn't properly summarized on the back for parents of preschoolers!!! When I started to watch this with my girls I almost fainted when the concept of 'Santa's not real' came up- My girls hadn't even considered he wasn't real. It sort of ends up ok- but there is some lying on the parents part that is introduced. I would NEVER buy this for a young child. In fact, I cracked the case and told my girls I accidently stepped on it so they would't watch it again. How sad!!!"
5,A forever Christmas recording,"My favorite cut is ""Gesu Bambino."" It's a very difficult song to sing, and breathtaking on this recording."
4,Easy reading but his stories are not always fulfilling,"You get the impression that you are shortchanged at the end on several of his stories; some endings do not bring a lot of satisfaction. Others float here and there without really getting anywhere and there's rarely any action. But when it does occur it's usually at the end. It's not to say that I really do not like Henry James, quite the contrary. I like him because he shows the values that were important in his time. And there is enough variation in the stories to make it worth purchasing and reading. This is a book to bring on vacation. You can read through one story in about two sitting depending on how fast you read. The type is a bit small for me, it would be nice if it were a bit bigger."
4,"Strong, good looking case that stays in place!","This is a solid, light weight case that stays on but facilitates easy typing, swiping and talking. Fits nicely into a pocket."
4,Pretty good case.,"This case is pretty good and it does fit the Galaxy Note (U.S.A. version) The only issue I have with it is that after a while, it looks like it gets dingy or dirty. I try to clean it though often so it doesn't look that way, but it still kinda looks like it's been threw a lot and I don't keep my phone in dirty places. Either way though, it's still a good case."
5,Perfect fit..!,"Easy to install, and fit exactly in the Galaxy Note...! Buy it you are not going to waste your money..!"
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,It fits perfectly to my beautiful white samsung galaxy note and makes my note more beautiful!!! I LOVE IT!!! :D
2,Overpriced and Underwhelming,"This case does look good and it is comfortable to hold, but for 16.95 it should be better. The cut outs fit well enough, but the buttons are much harder to press when the case is on.I feel that for this price it should be significantly better than my 3 dollar no name TPU case i bought on Amazon. It is not, so why spend more money for nothing special. If you are going to spend this type of money, you better get something for it.Go and check the Ballistic SG caseBallistic SG0867-M385 Soft Gel Case for Samsung Galaxy Note - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black Silicone/Black TPU/White PCfor the Galaxy Note to see what a proper case should be like; or just get that cheapo TPU case.Boxwave is just fleecing customers with this overpriced case."
3,Perfect Case.. AMAZING!,"I still amazed about how good this case is!.. It fits perfect and feels great!. and I love the white color around it. Also gives a nice grip to hold your Note when taking pictures!..For me, Best Case for your Samsung Note!.. :)****UPDATED March 22, 2012After a while of using it Ive been noticing that the case is loosing its white, now its like pinkish in the sides, and also and more important is a problem Ive been noticing with the camera. When you tried to take a photo with flash, it reflects in the case and u can see all the photos with a ""light"" under it always. I remove the case and it doesnt happen, so I'm afraid im going to give it only 3 stars.."
3,Does not mix well with denim,"The only complaint I have about this item is the fact that the white edges lose their pristine whiteness very quickly if you happen to wear denim jeans; even my wife's case has turned grey after sitting in her purse. I would give this 5 stars if they changed the material to fix this problem, as well as sent us replacements.As for protection, I haven't seen anything to top this case."
1,Don't waste your $$$ on this case!,"I have to admit that this cellphone case looks great when I first received it. It also fit my phone well and easy to install.HOWEVER, the white rubber edges got so dirty after I had it on for 3 days and I couldn't get it cleaned at all. I've read the reviews that mentioned this problem before I decided to purchase it, but I still went for it because I thought others buyers had it exposed under dusty environment. The truth is that this case gets dirty and dark naturally. The material is not good at all.Don't waste your money on this case and it's NOT worth 20 bucks at all. I've only used it for less than 2 weeks and then had to take it off because of its bad looking."
5,Awesome Galaxy Note Case Under $20,"The fit of this case is great. It helps me grip my phone better, protects the screen via a slightly raised lip, and still allows the Note to fit in my pocket. This is an awesome product!!"
4,Awesome!,"I looked for a cover for my Note for a couple of weeks before picking this one. I love it! Fits perfectly and looks great. The camera window, speaker, headphone & charging jacks, etc. all line up perfectly. My only complaint is that the buttons are hard to push. They're lined up, just take a bit of tenacity to manipulate. All in all a great case!"
5,great minimalistic TPU case,"I was looking for a minimalistic TPU case for my new white G Note i717 and this is a perfect fit.This case's edges sit just over the phone's edge thus not obstructing any part of the front face.All the cut-out slots align properly, the covered power and the volume buttons work fine.The matte transparent back is perfect as it almost looks like having no case at all.It is very flexible and does not add much weight or make the G Note look bulky.After 2 weeks of daily use I am seeing the corners turning light blue - being kept in the jeans pocket all the time.I've tried to wipe it with mild soap soln. but it is not coming off, it is very light and barely noticeable, would have preferred if this could be cleaned, but I am not going to drop a star for this."
4,Much better than the price would indicate,"the white outer edge did discolor over time, but this has done an excellent job of protecting my phone, and shows no signs of breaking down after about 7-8 hard months of use. It looks better on the white version of the phone which is not used for the photos here. 90% of the time folks don't even know that there is a case on the phone until i tell them- thats how slim it is and how well it complements the phone itself."
3,Nothing special here,"A few interesting songs on an altogether average CD. The best songs are Deception, So You're Famous Now, and Samara Dee. Dori Craze sounds quite good on You'll Never Hurt Me Again, So You're Famous Now, and Footsteps of a Lion. Unfortunately Dallas Talley's voice does not do the songs justice. You might want to give this album a try if you want a wide variety of music on one CD. You might be surprised by the track called Samara Dee."
4,"Good, though-provoking CD","This CD has a wide variety of musical styles, with intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics. There is also variety in the themes, pace of songs and vocal styles. The lyrics are thought-provoking and well-constructed. ""Deception"" is a stand-out for it's lyrical theme, has a bit of a ""Dark Side Of The Moon"" feel to it, but is original enough to be interesting. ""Heather Hello"" is a strong balld.Certainly a lot effort has gone into the CD and it deserves a wide audience."
1,A Dingo ate my movie!!,1915(1982) Directed by Di Drew and Chris Thomson.An appallingly bad Australian miniseries supposedly about WorldWar One but really some type of Aussie Peyton Place with some warfootage tossed in about ep 5 or 6. Boring. Crude. Badly acted anddirected. Worthless.Every Australian film I have ever seen about theFirst World War has stank like dingo poop.Add this one to that list.
4,One Of His Best,"Bob Dylan is a musicain from my past. My days as a ten year old watching him sing on Tv at a peace rally in Washington DC.. THE TIMES THEY ARE A CHANGIN... Yes, the times were a changing for this Album Street Legal. Dylan is no longer a kid with a guitar and a harmonica snarling out peace songs. With this album we see a wonderful mix of great lyrics, good arrangements, and improved mature singing. Dont get me wrong, but some singers accually write better songs than they can sing them. With Street Legal, I have to say I also enjoyed Dylan's singing as well as his craftmanship for wordplay.... I also feel this way about his BLOOD ON THE TRACKS ALBUM.. it is also very good. This CD really is a must for anyone who remotely likes BOB DYLAN... it really shines. You cant go wrong with this purchase."
4,She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,"Help! I can't get the music to Changing of the Guards, out of my head. It is obviously my favorite cut on the CD. If I had to pick, I'm generally into CD's more for the melody than the lyrical content. Senor (Tales of Yankee Power), and True Love Tends to Forget, are very strong musically as well. As another reviewer mentions, this is probably an underrated album. I give it a solid B. I find most of the other songs, good but not great. As always, I find the lyrics challenging but thought provoking and interesting."
3,An Album Not Entirely In Vain,"""Is Your Love In Vain?"" is one of Bob's best tunes, bar none. The rest of the album is mediocre to OK."
5,possibly our first glimpse of the current dylan,"What I find interesting in this very soulful, r&b- inflected collection of songs is the glimpse we get of dylan's latest voice, really pretty much the way he still sounds, that kind of cool deterioration, and grittiness we associate with him now. go check out forgotten jewels like ""true love tends to forget"" which makes me think of the ghosts of roy orbison and elvis, and also ""baby stop crying"". this is raw, brutal stuff. like, the guy who's singin ""new pony"" has to be out of his mind. and much of the muddiness of the original pressing has been lifted, i think. heartfelt stuff."
4,What a difference a mix makes,"Yes Street Legal still has its annoying aspects, such as the robotic female backround vocals on Changing of the Guard, but then again just about every Dylan album has a ""what was he thinking"" moment. This kind of inscrutability is what makes Dyan Dylan. However, the remix has taken what was a muddled mess and allowed many classic Dylan songs to shine through.I was quite frankly astonded by the difference."
3,"I love him, too, but five stars? Come on...","The sound of a legend, still on his feet, singing some new songs he's written and hoping you like them. Robert Johnson imagery aside, these are all second or third rate Dylan songs gussied up with girlie choruses and saxophone. It's shrugworthy. To everyone who gave this record FIVE! stars, i ask---are you out of your minds? If this is a five star record, what do you give HIGHWAY 61 or BLONDE ON BLONDE? A 20?"
1,So Bad It's Not Funny,"Some albums are worth having, and some aren't. I found this for GBP 2 ($3) in a bargain bin and I wasted my money. Don't get me wrong, Bob is the King (sorry, Presley fans), nobody could write what he has written, but sometimes the guy just had a contract to fulfill and turned out whatever junk was in the back pages of his lyric book. I haven't been able to pay enough attention to know what the lyrics are like, I have trouble getting through a listen! Don't buy this. Buy Bringing it all Back Home, or Desire, or Highway 61 or, just buy something else!"
1,Five stars? Get real...!,"First of all I'd like to ask all those who gave this album 5 stars how they'd rate Blood on the Tracks! 20 stars? This album was recommended to me by a friend, but now that I have it I'm sure it was just his idea of a joke..haha. There are only two songs on the entire CD that are worth listening to, Changing of the Guards and Señor (Tales of Yankee Power). The rest of the songs are so weak I can hardly believe it. ""Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?"" Need I say more? Well, yes I do 'cause so far I haven't even mentioned the AWFUL gospel choir that accompanies Dylan throughout the album. It will drive you MAD. So go ahead and buy this album if you want to, but don't ever say nobody warned you against it. Oh, if you do buy it anyway make sure to get the remastered and remixed edition. I didn't...but I'm sure you'll understand if I don't rush out to buy the enhanced new version."
4,The real blood on the tracks,"Dismissed as imitation Springsteen by several critics (presumably due to the prominence of Steve Douglas's saxophone), ""Street Legal"" caught Bob Dylan at mid-point in a creative hot streak that started with ""Planet Waves,"" and ended with ""Infidels."" Far from sounding ""fake"" (Rolling Stone's description of this album), there is an effortless quality to both the songs and the performances as if pure inspiration was at work. ""I wish I was a magician,"" Dylan sings at one point, and on ""Street Legal"" he truly is. From the countrified ""We Better Talk This Over"" to the sorrowful ""Where Are You Tonight?"" this album is as bittersweet as ""Blood on the Tracks"" and, at times, much more powerful. You can really feel the blood on these tracks, and, in retrospect, it shouldn't have been a surprise to see Dylan embrace Christianity a year later. Who but the Lord could relieve such pain?"
4,Fans of TOOM should give this a listen,"World Gone Wrong may've directly preceded TOOM, but the groundwork goes past Oh Mercy back to Street-Legal. Here you find Dylan referring to Robert Johnson on more than one occasion: the raw sound of New Pony, the title Is Your Love In Vain (Johnson's title was Love In Vain), the juice running down my leg line in Where Are You Tonight? No Time To Think adopts in the polka sound attempted in the demo version of Like a Rolling Stone. Senor became an immediate favorite upon first listen-it sounded great live in '78 and it's still a highlight of Dylan's concerts. The last four songs on this release achieve a cumulative power. The album wasn't generally well received during its original release. It's good to know the critical tide has turned somewhat over the past few years."
3,very mixed bag,"This album is NOT a five-star masterpiece, nor is it the certified disaster some proclaim. It rounds out Dylan's brief gypsy period (Tarot cards, facial stubble, bandanas, etc.) and offers some rich musical tapestry on ""Changing of the Guards,"" ""Senor"" and ""Where are You Tonight (Journey Through Dark Heat)"" Great subtitle on that last one cause that's what listening to this album is like - a journey through dark heat. The production is muddy; the lyrics are inpenetrable, even by Dylan standards. And the gospel background singers will probably annoy you as they echo each verse (""the keys as they clink...."") But if you can get past the clunkers that populate the middle of this record there is a nice mood sustained here. Plus ""New Pony"" is pretty cool, no matter what anyone says. Don't be too hard on Dylan for this spotty work - this was not a good time in his life. For some reason, I just like ""Street Legal."""
5,Excellent,"A great Dylan album, but not his best. Street Legal is a very enjoyable album. Changing of the Guards is excellent. One of Dylan's best."
5,The best $100 dollars spent.,"This has helped me immensly with my workouts. After a year of over-exerting myself with nothing to show for it, I bought this and now I work out in my heart rate zone, making the most and the best of my workouts. Its been 3 months and I am seeing the results I had hoped for. I am thrilled!!!"
4,"almost a professional, and very affordable product",The heart rate monitor watch is a nice tool; it has a full set of functionalities and it is perfectly suited for a lot of types of training.The watch is very easy to use and instructions are user friendly.A complete set of programs allow planning of almost professional trainings.Despite all of this price is really affordable.
5,Nice Heart Rate Monitor,"I bought this HR Monitor for my wife, she loves it. It fits her needs, this is great it you want to control your daily workout without having interference from other monitors close to you, this one is coded, you can define your own heart rate ranges and keeps the last 12 workouts in memory. You can also transfer the information from the watch to the Polar fiteness trainer over the micriphone of your computer and to their website, no cables are required. You can also create your own program there, it really works, it's like having a real personal trainer"
1,No difference,This product smelled very sweet and strong when I opened it. The odor didn't come thru at all after I placed in my air purifier. Not at all. Waste of money. Just use your regular air freshner to give a nice scnet to your home. This product gets two thumbs way down.
5,Spooky!!!!!!!!!!,This is one of many great books by Troy Taylor. You will be glad you got this book. He tells a lot of history and then some great ghost storys too! I have all his books.
5,Thich provides easy access to Buddhist Practice for Everyone.,"As a bookseller in a new thought church's bookstore - The Store for the Miracle Minded - I oversaw the expansion of our ""New Age"" Tape and CD section. All of the ""Sounds True Audio"" labels recordings are top notch, and this particular title is one of the very best, and the best for its category (the study of Buddhist practice for westerners). I had the chance to meet and listen to many spiritual and self-development teachers and listening to Thich's voice one hears the peacefulness and intelligence that comes from a life of dedication to contemplative practice. These recordings are among the best for helping to heal the body/mind/spirit connection. I highly recommend them."
5,Andian Codex,"Williams experiences and life while in Peru actually transports you there into the experience. The awesome beauty & magic of this land, the Andian culture and it's beautiful people will touch your heart & soul. I so admire the work, dedication and heart of the Q'ero Shaman-Paqo and their belief in balance & reciporcity. They work outside of time/space in Spirit. We in the Western world with our culture & thinking could learn much from these wonderful people who see through much different eyes. They have a respect for ALL living things like our planet & animals.This is one of the best adventures & initiations among the Peruvian Shaman's I have read."
3,"No magical cure, but informative.","I guess like a lot of snorers I wanted to see if there was anything out there that could cure my problem without having to put forth much effort. Well, while this book does have a lot of info on snoring and how it can be curbed and even cured, there is no panacea hidden in it's pages. You've probably heard most of it all before, anyway. But it gets three stars for having a slightly funny sense of humor and a good amount of first hand experience with all of the ""cures."" By they way, the author seeming did put in the effort required to make these ""cures"" work and tried almost every ""cure,"" including surgeries, and he still snores."
4,laugh out oud,"Rob Simon's book, Snore No more, acutally lifted me out of the sleep deprived fog I constantly live in. With a husband who snores and yet swears not too, I laughed out loud while reading Rob's book. It's a great gift for both the snorer as well as the snoree victim. I have not seen anything like it.--Carrie Brown"
4,Very nice!,"These are quite nice to use on the OUTTER lashes, unless you have naturally LONG lashes (or want a unntaural look) you may want to buy these and the smalls and use the smalls on the middle lashes.(I do not recommend using lash tite!)"
4,Good pictoral,"First off, let me tell you that I loathe Hillary Clinton. I actually bought this book for my Clinton-loving grandmother for Christmas. I hated to put another notch in Hillary's best-seller status but, hey, it was Christmas.I picked up this book then couldn't put it down until I saw every photo and poured over every recipe! If you've never taken the White House tour, just get his book instead. You'll see more in the book than any guide will show you. The behind the scenes photos are quite interesting and the recipes make you feel like you attended the dinner where the dishes were served.This makes a wonderful gift for anyone, not just Clinton fans."
5,Brought tears to my eyes,"I love the Clintons, but the photo that caught my eye was on page 284 of a sorbet. I'm going to scan it & use it as a screen saver.This is a beautiful book that the whole country, and particularly Sen. Clinton, can take a lot of pride in. AND the recipes are really good! It's such a top-quality book that I even sent one as a gift to my Republican friend."
2,Give us a break,"The spin machine to reclaim Camelot for Clintonville is already at work. One suspects we can look forward to many such attempts to put a Kennedyesque sheen on a White House that even supporters agree was a cauldron of greed, power-grabbing and gropping. Like the Kennedy myth, we should resist being seduced and instead appreciate that such books are gratuitous attempts by the powerful to ensure their legacy, make more money and -- in Ms. Clinton's case -- keep her image in the public eye....In short, don't waste your time."
1,Not Worth Buying,"If you want to look at the pictures, get a copy in the library or thumb through it at the book store. Your money can be spent more wisely on other books. The reading gets worse rather then better. Go to Washington and see the Whitehouse for yourself. This book can not replace the experience!"
1,Vanity Publication,"The photographs are excellent, but no better than 100 other similar books that constantly come out, and with no real creative flair. The text is unworthy of mention, void of insights into the really interesting aspects of White House life. Really, this would have been a second-rate magazine article. The reason for this book even to exist is hard to imagine, except Hillary and a publisher trying to capitalize on her political popularity. This is better than Jimmy Stewart's poetry, but not much.I have to admit, the good photographs would have rated an extra star, just as a coffee table book, if this weren't such an artifice. Hillary Clinton is not Jackie Kennedy and she is not Martha Stewart. She should stick to things where her interest and her talent are more credible, such as important social topics."
1,Not for the intelligent reader or political fan.,"After wading through this airy work, I was really disappointed. It is not any of the things I had hoped for, either inciteful for White House ops or some gossip unknown before.This book is really lacking in anything but nice pictures."
3,Twin Sisters,"Stephanie Kramer does a fine job of creating the disturbing relationship of two very different twin sisters, who are (at the same time), very alike. When Carol discovers that her twin sister Lynn has gone missing, she must fly to Montreal. She meets Lynn's friend and finally discovers that her sister had been lying to her all these years; Lynn was a call girl, and didn't work for the stock market. Suspecting that the supposed death of her sister had something to do with her clients, Carol goes undercover as Lynn and teams up with a cop, Sgt. Delveaux, to find out the secret behind the disappearance of her sister. Above-average direct-to-video release with dedicated performances, moderate suspense and a decent music score dredge this up from a one or two-star rating. Pretty good feature."
4,Dessert a la Mr. Food,"I've been a fan of Mr. Food for more than a decade. Don't know how he does it, but his simple and easyrecipes turn out delicious food that looks as though you slaved all day in the kitchen. You cannot go wronginviting Mr. Food Makes Dessert into your kitchen."
2,Sleep Inducing DVD,"I purchased this DVD to use in one of my classes. I fall asleep everytime I watch it...I don't think that is a very good omen.The product arrived in perfect shape....., but the content was less than thrilling."
2,What happened to Immune System Episode!,"I have vcr version of the video. I use the Immune System section showing climbing accident, and the related Immune Response to an injury. The DVD version does not have this episode, although the title, ""Universe Within"" from NOVA is the same. Kind of a ripoff. Thought DVD would be the same as VCR version......darn it."
5,Great Tool,"I use this in a class on Women and Exercise for both high school and in a modified version for non-biology major entering college students. They all find it fascinating and it leads to great discussions about anatomy, physiology and exercise. Kudos to WGBH and PBS."
5,Excellent carry bible,"Having never seen one of the Camberage Pitt Minion Reference Bibles, I didn't quite know what to expect. The quality of this book is one of the best I've seen. It is small, but not too small. The print is small but easy to read. There are no frills to speak of except the column cross reference, which is adeqate, but not as good as a Thompson xref. The lack of markers over words make the xref a little more challenging to use, but adds to the readability of the main text. The goatskin is really soft and supple. Everyone who sees it recognizes it as a quality piece from the start. I can't imagine a better carry bible to own."
5,Very satisfied,"I bought it for my personal use at home and it works fine. Its accuracy? I did not check it precisely but I feel it is good enough for me from rough comparing of its readings with digital multimeter readings. Also the wire splitter, which comes with the meter, has the feature of 10X (maginification of the current) and I found it a very usuaful feature. Overall, I recommend it."
2,Terrible Clamp,"I ordered two pairs (4 pieces), used for about a month, one pair (2 pieces) broke. They don't create any pressure any more, you can just yank them out from the working set after appying as much as pressure as you could. Called Amazon to get a pair of replacement, out of the box one of them has the same symptom. My Irwin ones, after two years of service, still out perform these in any case."
4,Quixtar works when you do,"This book is an easy to understand, consise overview of how different business models work including Quixtar. I found it well worth my time. We have been involved with Quixtar for over a year now and my wife and I both have enjoyed the relationships we have made, the positive training and motivational materials that have been available. (optional) and access to over 500 different stores through the web site that have agreed to pay us back a portion of their profits for refering business to them. These stores and the main site carry products such as tools, household products, vitamins, clothes, etc... at competitive prices. The 6 month guarantee on items purchased off the main site cannot be beat. Without having to inventory product this is a dream business but not a get rich quick business. If you do nothing you get nothing. I would recommend that anyone that is considering joining Quixtar read this book."
2,"Looks great, until the next day","I spent a few hours using these adhesive squares to run a 100'+ cat5 cable and I must admit I was extremely pleased when I was done, It turned out great. Then the next day, 3-4 squares fell off the wall .. no biggie .. I replaced them with new ones. Then the next day, I did the same thing. A week later half my cable is on the wall, the other half has fallen to the floor. 17/48 of my squares have now fallen. Very disappointed, however, it was a low risk investment. I'll try a different vendor and cannot recommend this product if you are sticking it to a wall or the door frame."
4,Could be better.,"The self-stick mounts work O.K., but maybe not so well on some painted surfaces. Clean your mounting surface really good before application."
4,"holds on tight, priced right","This 100 pack is quite the bargain; I used these to neaten up some cords around my home. The adhesive works well on most surfaces but I also figured out that I can apply a flat headed screw right through the center of these for extra hold in that rare spot if/where I need it - works perfectly! The translucent color disappears in most places and matches the 14"" heavy duty zip ties I am using them with. Very pleased with this purchase."
5,Great product,Very happy with these tie mounts. They work great - will stick to anything whether surface is cold or hot. Good value as well as these are hard to find in stores at this price.
4,Good basic info on how to use without a lot of nonsense,"I like using this style of guide for learning, teaching and referencing. It is straight forward, usually correct, easy to find topics, and arranged by a ""most likely"" way to present the information without a lot of excessive explanation. Probably a little shallow for programmers, but for us users it is very good"
4,Good Book,I think this a very interesting book and it is filled with a lot of detail and it will tell you a lot about the software
3,The New YANNI!,I have been a fan of Yanni's for years until I ran across Bradley Joseph's music (Yanni's former keyboardist). If you like Yanni you will LOVE Bradley as he writes beautiful melodies and takes music were Yanni left off. Check him out at http;//www.bradleyjoseph.com
5,Great recipes and an enjoyable read,"My father-in-law received this book as a gift after his wife passed away, and my wife gave it to me after he passed on. This is a fun book with some very good recipes. Our favorite is Chicken Wino (and it goes well with some fish too!). The stories/jokes keep the reading light, and the recipes are written very informally, thus setting the tone of the book; its easy and enjoyable to read. When my wife and I are looking for something different, we'll often refer to ""Our Man In the Kitchen"", as the recipes are consistently very good. I don't know if its in print today, as it was published in 1964, so we're holding tight to our copy!"
2,stick with polish,The product applied easy and made the wood look great but after drying left wax marks on the doors when the light hits and was unable to get off without stripping the door. I would not use or buy this product
1,"Poor remastering, a waste of money...","This review is for the 1997 ""Arrival"" CD that is part of ""THE ABBA REMASTERS"" series. The problem is, there are more re-releases and remasterings of the same CD's, so who knows which one is the best quality. Well not this one. The ""remastering"" has resulted in nothing more than a muddy, poorly EQ'd CD. Granted their earlier CD's tended to be a little too bright in the high end but they still beat this."
4,Not for beginners!,"I've been working my way up to some more challenging yoga, so I decided to give this dvd a try. Well, let me say it's got challenging covered! Alana is very good a bringing you through each pose but you'll see right away that you are going to have to practice often to have good form with some of the more difficult poses. My husband did this with me and was very frustrated at the difficulty of the poses and how easy Alana made it look. I would not recommend this for beginners, but if you've been at it for a while and enjoy a challenge I say go for it!"
4,good workout,"this yoga dvd is a pretty good workout for people who may have done yoga before. I have done some classes prior to this, but this is a little more intense and I can tell I'm getting a good workout."
4,Valuable systems engineering text,"This book addresses systems engineering tools and methods needed for building complex systems. Our systems have gotten much more complex, more inter-coupled than they were decades ago --think of the recent (Summer '03) East Coast power failure. Systems Engineering tools, techniques, and education must progress to address the new complexity. This is why Buede's book is invaluable. He has digested much of the current state of thinking regarding systems engineering practices and concepts, and made them available.This book reflects where systems engineering is going. It is written for practicing systems engineers who deal with complex systems, and for students who have someone leading them through the subject. Persons who engineer complex systems will find this book valuable."
1,Stay away from this so called book,"The worst text book for system engineering you could ever buy.Concepts are vague, the text could have been much simpler, and the concept much clearer. I bet that you can read the book many times over and still not know the basics of system engineering.The only good chapters of this book are chapters 4, 5. You know why? Because they have nothing to do with systems engineering."
3,A bit of a let down: NOT a restoration book.,"Not a bad book. Was truly hoping for tons of detail regarding problems etc. for restoration or future purchases: better to use the Ferrari Guide to models via PDF for $4-9 at half dot com. Basically a cursory look over different year models and what they should look like. Lacks some commentary on describing the differences. If you are looking for a restoration book, this is NOT it. It is an easy read but d-r-y.TOO BAD Keith Bluemel is the Ferrari's top guy for details. He is a regular contributor to Cavallino [Ferrari's Offical Magazine] etc. and his price guides are usually near correct every issue. If anyone should be able to inspire a good book on Ferrari, it would be Keith, but he must have dozed during this one [almost made me feel he was just issuing a book for some quick money....]."
2,When are you going to ship my order? I did order two days ago.,When are you going to ship my order? I did order two days ago. It is very cold outside. I appreciate your quick response for my order!! Thanks.
5,The best buy I ever do,"Is the best jacket I ever had, and for use in climbing in cold weader in Ecuador is fantastic and in some cases to hot, size is perfect, the packing is easy and small."
5,Terrific Spanish music!,"I saw Rosario with her band on Spanish TV during a recent vacation and they were AWESOME! It's hard to believe nobody outside of Spain has ever heard of her. I bought ""Siento"" right there in Barcelona & got her other 3 CD's after I got home (two from amazon.com and one -- the latest -- from crisol.es in Spain). They are all great! Even if you don't know the language. Recommended!"
5,One of my favorite books EVER!,"I bought this book in 1981 at the local Hook's Drug Store, a chain now long gone. I was in high school, and loved both the H/H and the many characters -- especially Mamere. It has been a keeper on my shelf, and replaced several times. I just finished reading again, and love it just as much. The witty dialogue, family love, fantastic descriptions -- truly a fun read. If you are looking for angst and sex, pass this one by. If you are looking for a Regency with a twist of history, choose this."
1,What a waste of paper this book is!,"... The plot is fairly traditional- marriage of convenience, dour man rescued by the love of a good woman, Napoleonic schemes- but the dialogue is absolutely the worst I've ever read in this type of novel. By trying to cram in every single possible example of period speech, the author makes the conversations wooden and often incomprehensible. Serious issues like child abuse are thrown in seemingly to add interest, but are abandoned rather than explored. Each character is more like a cariacature and the end of the book does not provide any satisfactory answers to the questions raised during the course of the book. I was extremely disappointed by this book and was barely able to force myself to finish it."
4,Wonderful,"This was such a great product, not as spicey as I would have liked, but still a great product! I will be ordering more in the future!"
2,A decent read for Summmer,"I pickup up ""Those Baby Blues"" based on what I had read on the back cover. By half way through the book, I have admitt that I was disappointed in the book. The beginning started out well, but ending of the book seemed a bit unrealistic. Neither of the main characters ever showed deep emotions to the situration that brought them together. Also it seem that the writer wanted to end the book without finishing up the storyline. Overall, ""Those Baby Blues"" is a decent book if you are looking light read."
3,Weak and shallow.,"After reading the rest od her books, I have to say this book was not up to the standards of the rest of the books. It was rather shallow and then silly. It started out OK, a pretty wild plot about baby switching, but hey, I can take the odd, far reaching stories, as long as they are good. I have a pretty good imagination and read all kinds of books, paranormal included, so even though this was a really far fetched plot, I figured it would be good. I know how believable a plot is does not make a good book. Its the story. Everything all together. The problem is there is nothing to hold this story together. No bonding, emotion, love nada. The girls are cute. The body guard was a thorn in MY side. He really got to me. There is just no depth to the story what so ever. Its not a light read, its an empty read. I like light reads too, that is what I figured this was. But like I said, it was empty. Glad I have not run into anymore like this one. I hope this is the only bad apple there is."
4,Good read!,"This book was a ""Treet"" from start to finish! I may be a little partial to movie star heroes after writing my own in Lost in Italy (not published), but that doesn't take away from this fun, sexy, heart-warming book. Give it a try."
3,Best and Worst mug,This mug does keep drinks colder than any other freezer mug I have seen but my wife has had to buy me one every year because it develops a crack in the plastic over time. This will be my third one in three years.
2,Cracked the first week ......,Gave it to my grandson. He loved it but after 1 week it cracked wnet he had just taken it out of freezer :(
5,SAINTS Who they are and how they help you,"Very interesting and informative. Every Saint from A to Z you every wanted to know about. Makes a great gift for First Communion, Confirmation or friends and family."
1,Didn't work for me,"I spent a couple hours with this book and can honestly say that I discovered very little new or insightful information. I have modest expectations of books like these, figuring that if I can capture one new useful piece of wisdom, my time and money would be well spent. Unfortunately, I did not find anything useful here.In addition, I found the style of the book made it hard to move through the book quickly while easily capturing the few big ideas. Do authors who write books like these really think that senior executives have the time to read 250 pages of dense text ? Get to the point, and get out. But, then I guess no one would pay ...for a 25-page book !"
1,Laughable in content and presentation,"Fumento's arguments are laughable and unsubstantiated, his presentation boorish. It is now widely accepted that AIDS is largely a disease of the poor and uneducated. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest AIDS rate in the world, transmitted predominately through heterosexual contact. Recent history has turned the ""myth"" to reality."
1,ideological hack science,"Considering that you can round off the HIV+ homosexual population of America when talking about AIDS numbers in Africa, the conclusions of this book are specious to say the least. If you're an ultra conservative who likes blaming the price of gas on gay marriage, no doubt reading this book will make you feel good."
2,wish fulfillment,"Parts of this should be labled as a work of fiction, not fact. The writing is biased--full of loaded language, opinions disguised by 'facts' and other such unreliable content.Nice fantasy you all are living in. I wish that Fumento's theory was true. It would be nice to believe, but I simply cannot.Hysteria is wrong, but so is this blase, 'not me' attitude the author advocates.C'mon, people! Wake up! We need to find a middle ground--PC hysterics is wrong but this isn't the solution to it. Why doesn't Fumento do something worthwhile, like write a book about AIDS that doesn't pander to the vulnerabilities of his readers?"
4,thesis correct; good arguments; pedestrian writing,"If you have adjusted your social life out of a fear of contracting AIDS, you need to read this book. Fumento's thesis is correct. His arguments are fairly compelling (although I read the book long after reaching the same conclusion regarding heterosexual AIDS) and comprehensible by laypersons. The writing is merely average, and Fumento is a little too self-congratulatory and arrogant at times, which is annoying. Still, it takes a lot of intelligence or common sense to recognize that heterosexual AIDS was and is a myth, and I give him credit for that. Given the anxiety (and lost opportunities) that AIDS-phobia has caused young people in the U.S., this book must be considered a public service, and Fumento is to be commended for putting it before the public. Despite the fact that the writing is pedestrian, the mere fact that Fumento's thesis is correct -- though contrary to public belief even now in 1998 -- justifies a rating of 4 out of 5 stars."
3,Old-Time Advice,"While very well-written, this book is in considerable need of updating. The edition I've just recieved was published in 1988.There are many newer books available as well as many online resources with more up-to-date information."
5,Fabulous product.,"I bought this after seeing how much the SeaCure helped my geriatric dogs. I tried this for myself. My digestive system seems to be happier. There has also been an annoying itchy patch on the back of my scalp for over 5 years. I've tried all sorts of vitamins, creams, shampoos with no luck. Since taking SeaVive, it is almost totally cleared up. I also just feel healthier and more energized."
1,I hate this book,I don't think this book even deserves 1 out of ten. I was forced to read it at school and it was awful. Boring with no decent story line and a main charater who was far too goody goody for words . If you ever see a copy of this book BURN IT
1,"I love the book, but I hate this abriged version",The book is great and this abriged version is a money waste. I will suggest people to find free recording on the internet which includes the whole book.
4,One's Own Identity,"Jane Eyre is a romantic novel. It portrays life for the women in the early 1800's. Jane wasn't like the other woman, she wanted to take care of her self. She didn't want the men to take care of her. She even compared herself to a man, and said she was smarter. Jane once said, ""I can't stay here to become nothing to you."" This quote showed that Jane wanted more out of life, than to be just a house wife. When you read this novel you will see that Jane is trying to find herself and on her journey in doing so, she also finds love. If you are into this kind of stuff, then you will like this book."
3,Jane Eyre? Pretty good!,"I just read Jane Eyre for a 9th grade classic book project. Even though I chose the book, as it was recommended, I found it was a bit slow in some parts, Charlotte Bronte gets so into her descriptions that it bores the reader from time to time. It was a good book all the same.The writing technique amazing. I loved the romance and the happy ending. I recomend it to tennagers and young adults,but a word to the wise keep a French dictionary handy!"
5,A Heroic Tale for all Ages,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me, and I'll never regret the day I accepted his suggestion and got this book. A beloved classic, which I have never in my life heard of, has become my favorite book of all time. Better than Danielle Steel. Better than Stephen King. These are the books that will last for ages to come."
4,Beautiful I.D. and Value Guide to Ceramic Coin Banks,"This 200 page softbound book contains over 1,000 full color, large, sharp photos of every type of ceramic coin bank. Each entry includes the description, size, dates and value (1997). Although essentially an I.D. and value guide, there is a considerable amount of information of value and interest to the collector. Included are: Ceramic Manufacturing Processes, Dating, Condition, Rarity Ratings, Geographical Ceramic Manufacturing Centers, and Photo Notes. Chapters range from Human heads, Humans, Cats, Dogs and Elephants, to Squirrel, Fish, Monkeys, Lions, Vegetables, Pots, Books, Vehicles and Ships and Purses. A complete glossary and bibliography are provided. Very useful for collectors of this popular topic."
5,Variety of Smaller Banks,This is a great book for the established or beginning coin bank collector! It really has a great variety for any type of specialized ceramic bank afficianado. As a long time collector & seller I recommend this book to any one!
3,Slightly dated,"Originally aired on The History Channel as a 1 hour program, this DVD felt a bit short at just around 50 minutes of Vegas material.The program starts with a solid presentation of some historical background regarding the rise of early Las Vegas; Hoover Dam, Bugsy Siegal, the Rat Pack, etc.Then the program goes into all the usual Las Vegas things such as Vegas Weddings, neon signs, showgirls, etc. that gives Vegas its identity. There is plenty of commentary from Wayne Newton and some from Debbie Reynolds.Since the program originally aired in the mid-1990's, the material feels a bit dated. The Mirage, Treasure Island, and Luxor are given plenty of attention as the ""modern marvels"" of Las Vegas; Casinos which were all opened in the first half of the ninties.Not withstanding the fact that you won't find anything about the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, or Paris, this DVD does manage to present the historical aspects of Vegas in a solid and entertaining manner."
4,I found what I was looking for.,"I enjoyed this story because I felt like it didn't try hard to be anything more than a fun story. Sure, agreed, alot more meaning could have been cultivated from the characters experience in the Third World, but I feel like that wasn't why the story was written.Everything between the covers serves just the story. It doesn't play up to a higher, deeper meaning, and that's fine. A great story might do that.This was a fun story with high suspense exploding into flowing action sequences. The characters were vibrant. The setting... I find myself remembering it like I were there.I dig. I give 4 because I thought the prose was a little uneven at times. Maybe could have used another revision."
2,Real World Adobe Acrobat Pro 6 a Big Disappointment . . .,"After waiting several months for this book to be released, I found it to be a much too general and high level overview for my needs. The only thing more disappointing was the $12.67 refund I received when I returned it. I went right to a local bookstore and bought the Adobe Acrobat 6 PDF Bible by Ted Padova."
4,good for little hands,This block set is good for little hands.My little master loved building house for me.The size of the blocks is good enough but the block may hurt if it falls on babys foot.My son is 2 years old. Overall its a good toy for little builders
3,More Tease Than Substance,"The idea that there are cycles of civilizations going beyond our known historical period is tantalizing and possible. However, this dvd only offers a few snippets of proof on which to base the theory. Also, the program is shorter than advertised."
3,AND.....,"I was disappointed in this DVD because I expected it to be mostly about the Astrological/Spiritual result of this ""great year"" cycle. Instead it spent all of its time discussing the astronomy and physical artifacts connected to there being a great cycle and very little time dealing with the spiritual meaning of the cycle. The carefully made case presented here is a very interesting addition to the ""clock"" of Astrology, but it is a little like listening to all the reasons that Venus should exist and and then being told that it probably does exist and hoping that you will now hear when you will see it and what that will mean to you...and instead seeing the credits roll."
3,Pricey for only 46 minutes,"This DVD is only 46 minutes. I believe this topic could easily yield over 100 minutes. Although the DVD is a high quality production, it is not worth any amount over $10. Pickup a book instead."
2,Good...If you believe in witchcraft,"Admittedly I am a Yankees fan, but I still thought--at first--this seemed like a cute book. Indeed, I even gave it as a gift to expectant parent friends from New England.But if I'm honest, I have three problems with it.1a: First and foremost, it perpetuates a ""Curse"" which was simply a face-saving method of making excuses. As better writers have said, it rationalized--even justified--ineptitude, making losing a badge of honor for Red Sox fans.1b: The basis for said ""curse"" does indeed appear to be anti-Semitic in nature. (A 'Curse' born of hate, by Glenn Stout/ESPN).2: Finally, and especially on subsequent re-readings, the book seems light. I understand it is a book for young readers, but where is the explanation for how the Sox won in 2004, other than a full moon? If there was such a ""curse,"" how was it finally reversed?"
2,turning anti-semtism into a children's book,"In a recent ESPN article, baseball historian and author Glenn Stout revealed the truth about the so-called ""Curse of the Bambino"": it is rooted in anti-semitic slander that originated 80 years ago with Henry Ford's racist newspaper, the Dearborn Independent. (Evidently, Ford thought Red Sox owner Henry Frazee was Jewish.) Now that the truth has been exposed -- a truth that evidently escaped Mr. Shaughnessy's reporting of the original ""Curse"" -- it is sad and disappointing that Mr. Shaughnessy and his publisher have chosen to push all this on children.Then again, perhaps Mr. Shaughnessy will do the right thing and revise his book to acknowledge the anti-semitic roots of the ""Curse"" he helped popularize. It would be the honorable thing to do, and he should be commended if he chooses that approach."
2,Disappointed,"In general I finished the movie wondering if it really was the end, some good action at times, but overall a slow moving movie. I had expected better based on the premise."
3,The Grey,"This movie was not at all like the previews they ran on TV, the graphic's were terrible. It was almost like a kid make this movie, the wolves in it were so terribly portrayed it was awful..If you want to see it Rent it not worth the money I spent to buy it. Sorry..Thanks Ronda"
1,It did not work in my DVD player,"We bought a different DVD (from America!) I did not realize that this UK one had a different ""region"" so it did not work in my player. I do not know whether or not more advanced DVD players have the ability to change regions.OH WELL. But this would have been nice to know before purchasing.P.S. Love the movie, just not the specific DVD we received. Very upsetting."
2,"""Alive"" meets ""Frozen""","Even though I kind of knew what this movie was about, I was really, really disappointed. It wasn't much more than a rip-off of ""Alive"" and ""Frozen"". Frankly, there was just nothing original about it, nor was it very realistic. Plane crashes in arctic, wolves hunt survivors. My personal favorite has to be the fact that in the movies, people seem to be able to survive being submerged in icy water for extended periods of time, emerge dripping wet in subzero temperatures and yet continue to plod on. Yeah, yeah, I know... it's just a movie!"
2,Come on..........,"What could have been a good movie ended up being a little stupid. It may help a lot if you know nothing of wildlife and firearms when you watch this movie and if you have seen neither ""Survivorman"" nor ""Man Vs Wild"". Liam's character carries a rifle but we are always shown shotshells. Then, he ""Macgyvers"" the shotshells to the ends of sticks and states that they are like ""bangsticks"". I wouldn't try that at home nor in a survival situation. Liam takes control of this group of ""survivors"" but if I were one of them, I would have thought that he was dummer than a bucket of hair. They should have never left the wreckage of the plane in the first place. Lastly, the portrail of wolves as ""land sharks"" is way over the top and only adds to an unjustified bad image for the animal."
3,Disappointing,Very dissapointed in the movie. Very dry. The movie lacked in many ways. Save your money. I guess it's hard to make a good movie now a days!
2,Seen B-Movies with more realistic animals,"Forget that Liam Neeson is and has always been a wooden actor. His movies are usually carried by the plot or his co-stars, yet they always come off fairly decent. However, when you add CGI wolves to the mix that look more fake than a prosthetic leg, how am I suppose to take this seriously? Did The Edge (which is a much better film I might add) animate the Grizzly Bear? Even the wolves in the The Breed & The Canyon looked better than this with probably half the budget. I could really care less for any of the characters in the film because of the crappy acting from Liam and the overall fakeness. I nearly split a gut every time someone would die and Liam stared off into space trying to show some sort of emotion. This guy couldn't portray grief if you killed his whole family. Don't waste your money. Buy a proper wilderness movie like The Edge."
3,Sad ending.,"i wish they made the ending happy-that the main character was saved, at least. The ending made me felt sad and hopeless. lol"
3,"OK, expected better","Expecting another pretty decent action/thriller Liam Neeson film I found The Grey quite entertaining, a little disappointed by some poor story, believability and the constant nagging in my head of the ""seen this done better before"". The ending is OK, like the rest of the film, just make sure you watch to the end! (hint hint).If I was asked whether it is worth watching by a friend, I'd reply ""watch Alive (1993) instead - same thing, true story and a vastly better film""."
3,No hope here.,"While this movie was gripping, it was unrelentlessly bleak. I would not recommend it for kids, the faint of heart, or wolf lovers. Part wilderness survival, part horror, all hopelessness. But, it does make Minnesota winters seem balmy."
1,Disturbing,Thought it might be an exciting survival/ inspirational tale. Turned out to be a horror movie based on the mistaken belief that wolves are man-eaters. Hated it.
3,VOID THE OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE,i liked the leading actor liam neeson he's a very good actor. the only thing i didn't like was the use of so much bad language being used. Sometimes that can destroy a very good movie.
2,Love Liam! But.......,"Liam Neeson is a fantastic actor and I love him dearly. But this movie was not very good. Plot was weak, acting very strong, wolves totally computer generated. Everybody dies one by one. You just wait for the next guy to be killed. Depressing!"
1,Very disappointing,"One word: implausibility. Who doesn't like Liam Neeson, but this film is really awful. It's difficult to know where to start, but the two central concepts that defy belief are these: that a passenger jet could go down on American soil and no one will be interested in getting to the crash site; second, that on a planeload of roughnecks returning from a drillsite near the Arctic Circle, there is ONE firearm, and it becomes inoperable because of the crash. There are many more, but the film depends on your acceptance of these whoppers. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
1,just horrible,I watched the trailer and it looked good but it was a complete let down the movie plot was really sketchy and the ending was the worst EVER!!!!
3,Terrible Ending,"I would like to provide my commentary for the ending, but then that would destroy the events leading up to the ending for someone who has not yet seen the movie. Liam Neeson is a great actor and possibly viewed by many as a magician who can accomplish anything. The producer should have factored that in when creating his ending."
1,a complete waste of time,"I really wanted to enjoy this, and in fact cajoled my wife into sitting with me to watch. She lasted about 10mins and left. I managed about 30. Almost every scene was improbable or downright stupid. From the 1-dimensional characters to the toy wolves I found myself in disbelief that Neeson would participate in such silly nonsense. 'nuff said."
1,Worst movie ever...,What else can I say WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!! Not a fan of Liam Neeson but really wanted this movie to be good. 2 hours of my life I will never get back
2,Sad and depressing,"If you feel like being bored and depressed watch this movie. No action, no real story or plot, no happy ending. Basically just a bunch of guys freezing to death and being terrorized by wolves."
4,"Good process, mediocre movie","Process went ok but the movie was waste of time. Predictable, cheesy plot. The ending made no sense. Characters were shallow."
2,WELL MADE EXISTENTIAL CRAP,"An infuriating movie, full of some fine moments and at times, brilliant filmmaking. BUT it's still a pretentious half assed bore at times as well. For every great scene or moment, there's three more frustrating, unfinished scenes that are mired in self concious twaddle.It's almost as if the very talented Joe Carnahan started with an unfinished story and has blown it out with brooding, contemplative moments that only occasionally work. Ironically, had this been the man battling wolf thriller it was promoted as, it really might have been something.Thank God for Liam Neeson, it's his strong presence and natural gravitas that anchor this otherwise muddled experience, in fact without him it would be almost unwatchable."
2,Dogs rock,"I just endured this ridiculous movie. Who knew Dire Wolves were no longer extinct? Lots of testosterone, not a lot of IQ points. At least the wolves win. Yay!!!"
2,"Love Liam, but this movie was a real downer","I was surprised how lame this movie was. I suppose I should have guessed it would be a dismal movie, with the premise of a plane crash and group of people trying to survive in the wild and fight off wolf packs. I guess I was just expecting some super hero powers in Liam (think: ""Taken"") - but in the end, he's a mere mortal like the rest of us, and the wolves get them all."
1,Waste of time,"This is basically an 80s horror flick with the wolves playing the role as the killer. Amazing how they can run so fast in the deep snow, yet the humans are falling over themselves trying to get away. Don't waste your time on this."
3,not Liam's best move...,"Okay for a rainy afternoon....kind of disjointed, and the thin backgrounds don't make some character sense, But enough to get you running ahead of the pack....:)"
2,The grey aka worst ways to die,"I like Liam but this movie is sort of depressing, showcases a variety of worst ways to die in Alaska or wherever they are haha"
1,Not good...,"I didn't like The Grey at all. It was quite boring and dull, and the wolves looked very fake. The amount of bad language in the movie was ridiculous. I know there are some who don't care about language at all, but there comes a point where it is way too much. Every other word there seemed to be an f-bomb dropped. There wasn't nearly as much action as I thought there would be, either, it seemed to be very slow-moving. Just overall a pretty boring, language-filled, bad movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,poor movie,I did not like the movie if I would have knowing that is was about that kind of thing I would have not gotten itI would like to send it back. I have watched it 1 time and will not watch it again.
3,could have had a better ending.,"the ending could have been better. the're were a few really good thrilling moments; then is just kinda ended, quickly. Left alot of questions open, but not i a squeal type way. worth watching once."
4,"""Good Thriller!""","Liam Neeson stars in this 2011 thriller. After being in a plane crash,A group of men try to survive the wilderness against hungry wolves.Liam is great as usual and this dvd has nice picture and sound, butonly commentary and deleted scenes. I recommend this good thriller."
1,the grey- bleak and not in a good or interesting way,"I love good survival movies. Alive, great movie. Castaway-darn good. I wanted to like this one. I think liam Neeson is such a great actor, but he is saddled by the worst scrip Ive almost ever seen put onto film. Wolves/ villians that makes a man confront his own demons thing felt more like werewolves from twilight gone bad - and about as silly as that sounds- rather then the deeper meaning they wished they were. ugh so dumb."
2,The Grey,"Liam Neesan will hopefully be more choosey with his roles. This movie had all the low budget appeal of a Uwe Boll production. I live where we now have to deal with ""grey wolves"". Maybe I should send the producer a photo of one so he knows what one actually looks like."
3,A Decent Rental...,"This was a pretty good movie, at least for a rental. You'll have a good idea of what the movie is about from the trailer, but what you won't learn is 1.) the appearance of the wolves isn't realistic in a number of scenes 2.) the way the wolves attack isn't realistic at all, and 3.) the survival methods in the climate they're in would have them all suffering from frostbite, if not hypothermia and possibly death, within about 24 hours. On a more positive note, Liam Neeson had a decent performance and this is probably a decent rental if you've enjoyed some of his past performances."
2,Disappointing,"The Grey was unrealistic, underwhelming. I would not recommend this movie to anyone...and I am usually a fan of Liam Neeson movies. This was a miss."
3,A bit mediocre,"I like Liam Neeson in many movies, but I felt like this movie fails to produce a worthy ending. It is entertaining, but I would recommend not spending 5 dollars on it when you can spend 1 at redbox."
2,MAN PAIN,"This movie had a great cast, a great plane crash, and good cinematography. It also had terrible CGI wolves, a terrible recurring poem, and lots and lots of man pain--dead wife, missing the kids, nothing to live for, but stoic, and shared around a campfire after killing a wolf. Think Hemingway meets Jack London, only without London's excellent prose. And spoiler alert: after all the stuff these dudes go through? Every last one of them dies."
2,Nope that two hours is not about to walk through that door... they are gone!,"I'm not gonna say it was bad acting, I'm not gonna say the plot was incoherent and lacked the statisfaction of an ending, I'm not even gonna comment on much of the movie... because that would take more of my time. If you have to go to existentialism and things outside of a movie to justify watching it guess what... you've just had a two hour time suck. goodnight"
3,As it should be,"These men didn't deserve to live, I can't see any other outcome. Frankly, if this movie was accurate. They wouldn't have suffered as much."
3,Really good last scene in the movie,"This movie starts slow, but once it gets going, it is pretty good. The wolf action is the best. I have watched the last scene a few times over and it is a very poignant moment."
1,We threw this movie in the trash,"I am a big Liam Neeson fan and was intrigued about the description of The Grey. I was sorely disappointed. While this movie could have provided insights in how people face death, it fell flat on its face. The wolves were portrayed with an uncanny ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound or a very large canyon while the humans were portrayed as stupid and having absolutely no common sense at all. The scenes showing Neeson's character with his wife were unconvincing in that she was supposedly dying and yet her makeup was perfect and she looked like she could walk the runway at any minute. With movie technology being what it is, the wolves were more cartoonish than scary and we were never really able to see them anyway. I will not spoil for the ending for those who wish to view this movie. But I will say that when the movie ended, I chalked it up to a bad purchase and threw it in the trash."
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen,"It is absolutely incomprehensible how this film made it past the cutting room.Begiining with its ridiculous depiction of North Slope oil workers as a bunch of drunken bums(I have been there and seen these guys, who are usually too tired after their shifts to do anyting but eat and sleep)and continuing with Liam Neeson's shallowly drawn character (Why does he want to kill himself if he casre so much for his family?), and the outrageous depiction of wolves, who will not come within miles of a human if possible, thanks to people like Mr. Neesom's character who shoot them on sight, and ending with the alpha against alpha finale, the words trite, ridiculous and downright stupid are way too kind for a piece of garbage like this. Avoid it if possibile."
1,Did not enjoy,I did not enjoy this movie very much at all. It was very unrealistic and disappointing. I would not recommend it to friends.
1,Movie Has a HORRIBLE ENDING!,"Liam Neeson is easily one of the best actors of the current generation. The grey is a good movie, WITH good acting but the ENDING was horrible. There were so many other possibilities for the end and they had to leave as they did.I am upset that I invested $15 and 2 hours in the movie to see a good story develop and then slip away right before your eyes. This movie is worth seeing when it is on a non-paid cable network in 9 months or so."
1,I'd rather be eaten by wolves than sit through that again.,"I think someone was trying to make a cerebral, modern day version of ""Deliverance"" and somewhere, something went terribly wrong. What an incredibly lame, illogical film. Skip skip skip it!"
1,By far one of the worst movies I have ever viewed,"I expected an action/adventure film with great acting and found myself hoping for it to show up all the way to the end. What a disappointment! The dialogue (90% expletives and profanities) was unbearable, the plot was insufferable, and the purpose was non-existent. The obvious atheist agenda left the viewer with nothing more than an atheist expects to be left with: NOTHING!"
1,I hope the wolves attack everyone associated with this movie.,"If crap could crap and then that crap could crap it would be better then this crap of a movie.So let me get this straight: A plane crashes and a group of men are chased for days by wolves. These men jump off cliffs,survive plunges in freezing water, have no food and still end up in the middle of the wolves den.I hate everyone that had anything to do with this movie...even Kraft's services."
1,Horrible!!!,"I don't know if my expectations were too high since I am not used to being disappointed by Liam Neeson movies or what, but this movie was TERRIBLE. I really do think that the 3-star average that it boasts is too much for this one.Even Neeson's charisma cannot save this plot and dialogue.If I had to describe it in 3 words, it would be: Tedious, Predictable, and Contrived!!!I actually started fast forwarding the last 30 minutes just so I can get to the end and see if there would be a meaningful conclusion to this charade - Nope. Sorry!!! Just as idiotic as the rest of the movie."
2,Interesting plot but less interesting outcome,"I love survival in the wilderness movies and that is what made me check this out. Such movies are rare today and they don't make good ones. I also think Liam Neeson is a good actor and had much more hope for this than what I got.My main problem with this movie is not the story and not the men, but how the wolves are portraited. I know enough about wolves to know they don't behave like these. I didn't read any reviews or synopses before seeing it and after a while I was wondering if it was some kind of werewolf-movie or perhaps a prehistoric beast up there in Alaska! A different apporach regarding wolves and other threats out in the wilderness would have made it a lot better in my opinion."
1,The Grey,This is one of the worst movies I've ever scene. Avoid. Not worth money to rent or time to watch
2,Better Off Skipping This One!,"Normally even 3 star movies are pretty decent.This one on the other hand was fairly boring in my opinion.Slow starting and gets slower.As other say, you should skip this one."
1,boring... how can someone sign to do such a bad movie... what a waste of money,"what a waste of money to produce such a flop. No topic, not creativity, not anything of value... wish i could get my money back... or even further my time wasted on this"
2,"Wanted to love it, but came up empty","This is a strange blend of atmospheric art-house film with flashes of sepia-toned memories of childhood or former lovers, and a grim survival tale in the beautiful Alaskan wilderness. While this could be an interesting mix to create a high-brow narrative of daring and clever escape, it doesn't add up to much. There are no real ideas here, the entire film could have been a brilliant 20 minutes of lovely, grim determination, but instead it keeps repeating the same tale: survive the wolves in the cold. That's it. For an hour and a half. The photography, acting, directing -- all are top notch, but the story is just... uneventful, which is a high-brow way of saying boring."
1,Ridiculuos!,Waste of time! Ending incomplete and unfulfilling! aa bb cc dd ee ff gg rr rr rr rr rr i i i i i i i i
4,Survival of the smartest,We saw this in the theaters and knew we would own it when it came out on Blu Ray. Could it be the alpha male (wolf) was the smartest or was Liam's character. The question you have to answer at the end of this movie is who survived.Action filled drama. d
4,very nice movie,really was a nice movie I bought for my son we watch the movie together . Surprise me that how even the animal protect their territory
4,The Grey,Good movie but really hard to grasp. Its heart wrenching. Wasn't too happy with the ending either. Worth watching at least once.
4,Must See,"This movie just left me in awe. Beautiful and heaartbreaking and powerful. This is something that everyone should see, but it is too upsetting to watch this often so I gave it 4 stars. Really powerful, worth seeing and not at all a waste of time."
3,not so good for Liam,"This could have been a very good movie seeing how it had Liam Neeson and a decent cast. But, alas the ending was a total letdown. Not near the caliber of what I expected from his past movies. Yes, I know he didnt write it but, just putting it out there that there is that disappointment coming at the end."
4,Great Movie,"I love wolves and I find Liam Neeson's character strong and believable. There was a bit of suspense about his relationship with his wife which I liked. As far as the ending, people should use their own imagination based on what happened up to the end. If you listened to what he said about the alpha, you should like the ending."
3,wait till it's on TV,"I kept thinking something was going to happen, and then the movie abruptly ended. I was disappointed in this movie and the ending. Save your money and wait until it comes on TV."
2,"not ""grrrr"". More like ""fehh"".","Although dated, the movie started with a good concept. Ultimately, it fizzled. A scene in the trailer, produced to entice the viewer into believing that there will be an ultimate showdown of man v. beast, never occurs. Major disappointment."
2,"Too Predictable, Too Cliche","A plane crashes and survivors are left to fend for themselves in the Alaskan wilderness. Along the way, the elements and terrain, along with a nasty band of attacking wolves, complicate things in a predictable way. For instance, when one of the men started to cough constantly, all I thought in my head was, he's dead. You'll find yourself saying the same thing throughout. You basically start to watch it just to find out who dies next. The suspense was just lacking and the story didn't really end. I guess we're supposed to fill our minds with how that fight goes?The bottom line is that if you are looking for a brainless motion picture that requires suspension beyond all belief, with highly cliche characters and events, rent this flick. Otherwise, stay away."
2,Poorly done,"Mainly the movie is, see wolf, run like hell. But you can't outrun a wolf. No attempt to make weapons fromthe downed plane wreckage, no attempt at defense. Complaining about food? Then why run and sap yourself evenmore? Food sources were right there all along. The wolves.No character development. No survival tactics at all. You couldn't have a worse bunch of ""survivors"".Do yourself a favor and avoid this travesty."
3,"Oh, C'Mon!","""Why did they make this movie?"" I asked myself at the end of it. Like cowboys and indians it's been made over and over and yes once again, too. ""Why did I watch it?"" was my next question. Well-worn survivalist fare. Watchable owing to the FX; attractive by it's action-genre status. I selected it on the strength of Liam Neeson billing. I watched it on the romance and spectacle of survival against the odds, yadda, yadda, yawwwwn..."
1,hopeless and depressing,"I thought I would like this movie, but the longer I watched it more I realized I was wasting my time. Its starts off with an interesting premise, but degrades into a hopeless and depressing nightmare that doesnt make any sense.Its not based on reality but rather a nightmare. If I want to watch horror I will, but this was just a survival film trying to be something else. All crap if you ask me..."
3,The Dark Grey,"A deep and intense movie. Lots of strong emotion and some pretty good acting.Even though the CGI rendering of the wolves is excellent, I thought they tried to make the main boss-wolf a little too menacing by making it too dark, it looked more black than grey. I also thought that by trying to up the scary aspects of the wolves, the use of 'eyes in the dark' bent the whole thing a little too much toward the 'supernatural'.Great use of digital shooting gear and looks fab on a BIG screen."
2,Sad,"The wolves look like something from Twilight. I hoped to see some cool footage of our long lost boogeymen, good ol' canis lupus, the big bad wolf, but instead I got hokey CGI. Also the, ""accept death when it comes for you"" theme of the movie is so non heroic that I could care less each time a survivor is picked off."
1,"This Movie would have been cool, if it went somewhere","This movie was cool, decent amount of action, not too much character progression, then it just ended out of nowhere, totally annoying, its like ok, thats it, done. were out of money, just end it. did the guy survive? did he find help or get out, did he tell his story, what? just end, ok that's dumb. its like i started watching a movie and left half way in."
1,"Over sentimental, not believable","Not much positive to be said about this movie. Characters are one dimensional, volves are behaving unrealistically, director is fishing for sentimental reactions every third minute of the movie with some flash back of the wife or kid of one of the rough neck . It all seems awfully calculated and down rght stupid. Coming from Finland, it's hard to believe that someone would freeze to death, if rivers are running free and sun is shining. Silly movie for silly people."
1,"Absolute Crap - Not worth renting, Not worth buying","Don't believe me and watch it. If wagging a dead dog's head in the dark and howling from the dark woods gets you off, then dig this one. The constant camera shaking is a cheap trick to hide the lack of investment into good special effects. Not so special in any way. Absolute trash."
1,Terrible.,This movie was seemed contrived from the start. I do not watch many movies and I am sorry I wasted my time on this one.
2,Cuss Fest,"Would have loved to watch this movie but, entirely too much foul langauge !! Had to turn it off !"
1,worst liam neeson movie ever,"im a laim neeson fan, liked him in taken / unknown. SO i was excited to watch the GREY. but was dissappointed and would not recommend this film"
1,The Grey,Let's put it this way.I wrote Amazon an email to ask them to create a zero star button just because of this movie.It was bad.Real Bad.Rent/Buy something else. Your welcome. Just saved you 2 hours of your life.
1,Good till the end. Then it went straight to the garbage can !!!!!!!!!!!!!,Liam was good. It had no ending. Very disappointing !!!!!!!!!! Would never watch it again in my life. Not worth the price.
4,The Grey,"Whatever your view about suspense and possibly the state of wolf populations in our environment, you will find this a spell binding film extremely revealing. It is sensitive, suspenseful, terrifying and engrossing. If you care about wolves, this film will let you understand why they have a place in the human intrusion into their world. What a wonderful view of a controversial subject with beautiful realities."
3,The grey,"Interesting movie, it's about time somebody brought up the other side of wolves, they don't all stand silhouetted in front of the moon looking pretty, they are predators pure and simple. Pretty deep movie, not for those who want a happy ever after ending."
4,better than i thought.,"seeing Liam kick some wolf ass is pretty fun. it was a very entertaining flick. didn't have to many slow parts, that's always a good thing."
2,THE GREY,"THE MOVIE WAS ALRIGHT, SUSPENSEFUL, THOUGH IT LACKED A GOOD ENDING I THOUGHT. I LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER AND HIS ROLE IN THE MOVIE."
2,The Grey,"Not my favorite movie. Slow at times, and not the ending I expected. I guess I was hoping for a little more from the movie and it never came."
2,Stay with the plane!!,Man vs. dogs. Why leave a crash sight that will be looked for. Stay with the plane and eat like kings picking off one wolf at a time.
4,good but predictable,"I love, love, love Liam Nieson (sp?) in anything he does...(oops, I'm drooling on my keypad)! The movie, although it kept my attention, was so predictable...until the ending. I am going to watch it again because of the ending but, for me, that made all the difference between this movie and the one it reminded me of, The Edge. As with these kind of stories, it's a view into the true human instinct to survive at ALL cost...its always interesting to have that human dynamic laid out in raw form in front of you. What is amazing to me about those of us watching this type of human survival unfold we always try to place ourselves above the treachery it might take to accomplish our goal. Anyway, the movie is good with lots of action. The dialogue, however, was rather difficult to hear."
1,Worst movie Liam Neeson has done,Awful movie. Ridiculous plot: their plane crashes and wolves hunt them down...I'm not spoiling the movie for you as this is apparent in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Since when do wolves hunt people?!? Thought it would be at least okay since Liam Neeson was in it--nope.Worst movie I've seen in a long time... Worst ending I've seen in a long time. Don't waste your money.
1,Boring,Well I wanted to see this.. looked like some kinda remake of Alive. Totally worse. If you have any knowledge of wolf behaviour you wont like this. totally unrealistic. Just a buncha dudes being picked off by insain wolves. Would have definatly been better if the writers/produceres actualy educated themselfs on wolf behaviour.
2,At least Liam Neeson apparently lost his stupid faith at the end.,"One person realizes his life of boozing every weekend is empty.Another (Liam Neeson) recognizes that he's not getting any help from god, with or without faith, so he stops wasting time asking for it. Those were the two high points of reason in the film. The rest was formulaic, and the wolves' actions were unrealistic. People could have taken metal from the plane to make sharper, sturdier weapons, but didn't, so they seemed dumb. Why did they jump off that cliff again? To get away from the wolves, according to Liam neeson, but there were more wolves at the bottom of the cliff, big surprise there."
2,Profane and violent,I only rented this video because I am a Liam Neeson fan. But this film would be totally lacking in dialogue if not for the F word.
1,Boring!,"I expected action. Repeated battles against the wolves. Instead, men talking and reminiscing and being tracked by wolves that you hardly ever see.Do your self a favor and skip this movie. I usually like Liam Neeson movies, but he made a mistake appearing in this one."
1,Awfull beyond imagination,"There is no purpose of the movie at all. It's obvious that when a flight crashes in such a place everyone will die. The movie doesn't show how exactly the characters feel in that situation, it's just that the wolves keep coming and kill one by one and the characters keep running away from them.Oh also, they could have just collected the metal derbies of the flight and could have covered up the opening so that the wolves won't have chance to attack them and also they would have been a lot warmer.This movie is for those who wants to die, where this movie explains you shouldn't die by yourself but you're gonna die eventually anyway.And use of the F word is countless.I wonder what the director wanted to say through this movie. It was a total BS where the wolves are the heroes."
1,Don't waste your time and money!!!,"I love movies but this movie was awful. 1) You have to be able to stomach over 150 F-bombs, plus multiple other signs of a limited vocabulary. The trailer was prepared to misdirect the potential audience. I watched the entire movie including the short post-credit scene; still very disappointed. Don't rent it; Don't buy it."
2,Disappointing,"Being fans of Liam Neeson, we ordered this dvd. The film is violent and is probably the worst film we've ever watched. Would not recommend."
1,"DEPRESSING, WITH A CAMPITAL D","I hate war, prison, and people dying movies, seeing the previews it looked like Liam Nesson was going to kick some wolf ass, but no its everybody dying/slaughtered and of course they saved the star to be butchered last, hate, hate this movie, thank God I rented it, and of course Neflix did their usual, with their DVD's you can only watch the movie, not any of the special features, including the commentary, I wouldnt even take this sad depressing movie if it were free, angry I watched it and felt sad, horrified, and extremely depressed, boo"
3,it just slides over you...,"boy this movie was intense, within the first 20 minutes I was a pretty big mess. Grown men crying and the way they were forced to recognize and embrace death...pretty movving. On a side note, I have pretty big fear of crashing in an airplane and the scene where their plane crashes was one of the most terrifying I have had to watch."
2,poor use of Liam,"The Grey is slightly entertaining mostly because the wolves are terrifying. The script is weak in enough to make one feel they are watching a first draft of a bad dream after eating some suspicious Korean food. One where the dogs eat you. The choices the characters have to live with due to the writers lack of thought make the film hard to swallow. Unless the intent was to say if you made enough bad decisions in your life to put you at the arctic circle, you probably will continue to make disastrous choices and you will end up as food for more organized, more strategic packs. Hey, maybe this is about the war between western civilization and ""animal"" jihadists of the middle east. It is all about oil. Now it makes sense....."
3,i kept waiting for something to happen and then the ending sucked!,I watched it pure and simply because Liam Neeson was in it. I don't like flying so that should have been my first warning to not watch a plane crash. I kept waiting and then it was the end. Liam Neeson needs to stick with being a bad ass secret agent!!
2,Wasted 2 hours,Plane crash..bad guys fighting...wolves eat everyone...plot missing..more walking than lord of the rings..still no plot..big show down..fade to black..still no plot...
4,It was good!,"I thought 'The Grey' was well worth the rental price. The plane crash sequence was done wonderfully and I found myself actually 'feeling' it. For what it was, it was acted well, and the meaning behind the movie was great.My only 'glitch' with the movie is that I believe someone should have survived. Didn't have to be Neeson or anyone in particular, just someone. Also, I don't think it would have been too difficult to have constructed some types of better weapons from plane parts, to fend off the wolves. They all had knives. What happened to knives on sticks for spears?"
4,Good Movie,Great acting in this thriller. Man vs Nature. Plot kept my interest for the entire movie. Good special effects as well.
4,Intense,"This drama was good and Liam was intense as usual, but If you are looking for a hollywood ending skip this film."
5,Great Movie,"I would recommend this movie to all of our friends, hang on to your seat it will have you jumping"
3,"The Grey, Almost Real","I found the movie somewhat unrealistic. As a hunter Liam could have made weapons out of the parts of the aircraft, as well as wood. Rules of survival say stay with the aircraft, as most today have an ELT. To travel under those circumstances without every member of the party being armed with something throughout the whole movie with such a threat present may make for a good movie but not reality. Still had good visual effects and not a bad storyline. Liam is a great actor and played a great part."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"The movie wasn't as action packed as I thought it would be, but it was pretty interesting, well shot and over all pretty good."
1,An insult to the viewers intelligence,"If you have a brain and want to be insulted, then watch this movie. There was a ton of stupidity, for example shotgun shells for a rifle, but the last straw for me was getting out of a freezing river and laying down to relax on the riverbank without a shiver. Anyone who did that would be dead in less than 15 minutes. Any sane person would be jumping up and down, ripping their wet clothes off and fighting to start a fire. I could write about the crazy and unrealistic wolf behavior shown in this movie but I won't dignify that with a discussion. It was simply absurd.I enjoy a realistic depiction of nature and survival. If that is what you like, then steer clear of this trash."
3,Only one streaming delay,The movie was okay and the streaming was pretty good. Only one interuption and that could have been my internet connection.
2,Never got better,"I really like Liam Neeson, I just don't like this movie at all. It starts out good setting the plot.. at least I thought so... then it never gets better, it gets worse really. Extremely disappointing, there is a movie with a seemingly similar plot to this movie called The Edge, they are directed VERY differently and unfortunately ""The Grey"" comes out way behind. Would not watch it again, but I am still a fan of Liam a badly directed movie won't change that :)."
3,"OK, if nothing else to do",This one had Liam Neeson running with wolves and being Taken. Slightly more believable than doing the bad guys in Paris and the scenery was not bad.
2,Big disappointment,Wolves out for vengeance because you killed one of their own? Seriously? Give me a break! What a huge disappointment.
3,Plane crash in snowy mountains?,"Everyone from teenagers & Sasquach, to mature adults, in a more realistic setting, have faced a plane crash in snowy mountains. Not only that, but the lack of depth in the story line, and the predictable outcome, hid Mr. Neeson's talent. Too bad, he's a good actor."
3,The Grey w/ Liam Neeson,Not his best work but still entertaining. I would still buy. Giving this one as a gift. Waiting for sequal lol
2,"Good Concept, Bad Movie","Loved the concept, the scene setter, the way it was written. However, I can only take a certain amount of vulgar language that is absolutely unnecessary. It seemed to me that the director was adding F#$% to every line on purpose. That in of itself really brought the movie down."
3,Jason and Tenage Girls all over again,"Great acting, great scenery....False premis(wolves do not act vengful in wild and are not the size of a male tiger - do a google search if you doubt this; Horrible story line...An unrelented string of death and dispare with no redeaming value to it...The wolves are Jason, the oil workers teenage girls...No point to the plot...It will leave you with an empty feeling at the end."
2,Only 2 minutes of legit man/wolf fighting...,"Seriously, from the previews you think Liam is gonna be balls deep in wolves for most of the movie. Nope, it's just a bunch of guys hiking in the woods, and a wolf visits occasionally. Just watch taken."
3,"Suspenseful, but very predictable","I enjoyed the movie, but by the time it was half over, you knew exactly what was going to happen next. And why does it sound like a gunshot goes off every time the wolves attack? Just to make you jump in your seat I think. The plane crash was not quite as realistic as I was told it would be. Having said that, I still enjoyed the movie, it' a decent way to spend a Saturday night while eating a bowl of popcorn."
3,Movie review,I liked the movie right up until the ending which I hated because it was one of those cliff hangers where they don't reveal what actually happens!! I guess I was supposed to guess I don't like when movies end that way.But Liam Neason is a good actor and I usually do like his movies!!
1,"I want my money back, and 45mins of my life.","This film is ridiculous from multiple POV. Dont even bother.I didnt realize it was going to be an outdoor adventure movie, created by a bunch of Californians that probably never stepped foot out of a sound stage. This film is one of the worst I have ever watched."
1,Utter bull,"Worst movie I've seen this year. I hate the jerky, grainy filming. I hated the reflection scenes. I like Liam Neeson, but I hate this movie.Its really badley shot on the cheap, cant belive they had to climb down a cliff and the wolves were already there ...... utter crap avoid!"
5,"5-Stars, Easily!","I'm surprised at the amount of people who gave this movie 2-stars or under. Usually I look for an action or thriller movie, and although The Grey wasn't as much as I expected, I still thought it was a great movie. If you gave it one or two-stars, you didn't understand all it stood for. I have been watching the end over and over again, it's just that good. Don't let all the bad reviews stop you from buying this movie!"
2,poor effort,"Given the production values and a pretty good cast, I had high hopes, but apparently not high enough, as this movie only pissed me off increasingly as it rolled along. Well executed crash, but unfortunately, downhill from there. Evidently the viewer is supposed to believe that it wouldnt occur to a single survivor to search bodies and wreckage for weapons and food, as though anybody would go off to the Artic without both. And what was in all those backpacks? And you could tumblej down icy rapids with no hypothermia, and on and on. My kingdom for a spear?"
2,diggerarmadillo,"Although a lot of action, I really wasn,t interested in this type of action. A lot of same o same o action. Would not recommend to my friends. Sorry"
1,movie,"Did not get to see it. It kept freezing on me and would not load properly. Would love to see it but it was rented, and too expensive."
1,Arguably one of the worst movies I have ever seen!,"Where to begin. I kept fast forwarding in hopes the film would get better. It didn't. Basically, Liam Neeson fights way out of frozen Alaska wilderness with band of misfit dregs of society after a plane crash while fending off one wolf attack after another.Here is a little sample of the dialogue. Maybe you'll get the idea.Dreg of society guy one: F---!!!Dreg of society guy two: We're f----d!!Dreg of society guy three: F--- me!!!Liam Neeson, directing venomous anger towards wolf: Mother------!!!That's pretty much it for the duration of the film. Bad. Really bad."
1,Pointless,"This movie delivers nothing in a grey jacket. Even Liam can't carry this wandering, pointless script. If only there were a way to go back in time and skip this. I only hope that I can save others from this self indulgent, sophomoric lullaby masquerading as a movie."
2,Will everyone hurry up and get eaten so I can stop watching...,"Could hardly make it to the end of this movie. The acting was actually pretty good and the special effects for the plane crash were excellent (thus the 2 stars). Everything else was horrible. The wolves were 'inserted' at the appropriate times to enhance the drama/suspense; however, when they became a distraction for the action - poof - they were gone. The howling was done the same way... dialogue, dialogue, tension between actors (ok, cue the wolves) HOWLING (ok, stop so we can get some more dialog). This was so corny. Also, during the scene in the snow when they leave the airplane wreck the wind is blowing so hard you can't hear anything else, yet when they stop to help somebody they speak with library voices, and it's just fine, the wind is gone. Oh and did I mention I should have walked out when he curses God near the end. Don't waste your time with this. Buy Unknown or Taken instead."
1,How many times can the f bomb be dropped in 2 hours?,"What a waste of money. The story was weak. The plot was weak. The characters were thin, barely developed, and the dialogue poorly written. The effects (wolves) were amateur. And how many f bombs can they drop in one movie? (As many as 150 or more according to ""plugged in on line"". )I won't even give this one star. Please, please don't waste your time or money on this film. Liam Neeson... how could you?"
1,Terrible,DON'T go see this movie. Boring and cliche. zero interesting scenes and depressing as well.A total waste of Hollywood actors time and material.
1,Everyone dies,"Let me save you the trouble of watching this terrible movie. Everyone dies in this movie. Think of the good 80s movie Predator, but a thousand time worse."
1,Poor Movie,Do not waste your time or money. Poorly written and conceived. I had to fast forward 85% of the movie so as not to be bored to death. Enough said.
1,The Dumb.,"This movie was dumb. Seriously. So, so unbelievable. The acting sucked. The dialog was terrible. The wolves were dumb and unbelievable.Useless waste of time, unless you're, say 14 years old, male, and scared of fake-looking wolves.I've never done a review of just about anything before, but damn, the way people are gushing about this moving, I really don't have a choice."
1,ENDING SUCKED...RUINED THE WHOLE MOVIE,I'm sorry but I hate it when they do an artistic 'leave it to the imagination' ending. We watched the whole thing in order to be able to see if this man survived and you just leave us there and take our money. I hate that. Thanks a LOT. GET REAL..make a real kind of ending you can hang on to.
2,buster11,"no worth watching. not the typical Liam ""kicking butt"" movie I expected. very disappointed....this should have been free from prime members. I don't mind paying a few bucks for high rated movies, but this was a one or two star movie."
2,My movie review,"The Amazon quality was excellent, but I did NOT like the movie!! I enjoy the availability of quality new movies provided by Amazon, and thought thi would be a good movie! Not so!!"
2,The Grey,Liam Neeson is awesome but the movie is dark and depressing. Not a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Fairly predictable. won't watch it again or recommend it.
1,Terrible,"This movie was terrible. If you like European films, this is for you. If you like to walk away from a movie not feeling like crap, it's not for you."
1,Absolutely horrid.,"I usually don't buy blu-rays without having seen the movie first but because I'm a fan of Liam Neeson's movies, I took a chance- big mistake. If you have even the slightest knowledge about wolves or winter survival you'll be irritated by how pointlessly inaccurate this movie is. I say pointlessly because there was room for a good movie here if they'd have used some realism."
1,bad,"This was a very dead end movie.. it started out alright, but there was too much swearing for our liking, and it was a gross movie. Didn't even finish it after giving it 2 chances."
3,average interest,"Average interest, some drama, weak story line, good photography, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, etc"
4,Liam takes on The Wolves,"The movie was totally inaccurate. However for the love of Liam I will see anything.. I really liked the wolves but at one point they no longer look like wolves way to big, movement wrong, eyes looked weird. Later I found out they did use in some parts men in wolf suits. That really made me giggle. Its a great action flick if you ignore how these men argue each other to death. The wolves in real life would never challenge them as a group over territory that was just silly. The idea that a wolf den would cause such chaos is also silly. The wolves were great except for the ones in suits. The plane crash is excellent best part of the movie worth the price of the ticket. See it for fun I did and I had a good time! Watch out for the men in Wolf suits. You might spot one!"
2,Pathetic,"Ok. Let's start with the good points. There are some pretty good fighting and killing scenes involving the wolves. That's about it. The film maker obviously detests the oil industry and those who work in the industry. As a result, the oilmen are all a bunch of losers. When the plane crashes, do the survivor's stay with the plane where people will be searching for them? No, of course not. The EVIL oil company won't spend money looking for them, so let's walk across Alaska in mid-winter instead. Yeah, right....... Needless to say, this idea was pretty stupid even without the pack of killer wolves."
2,"Eh, Payday for Liam Neesan","See above. Intriguing idea, lost in the wilderness with a wolf pack stalking you, but just poorly executed. Sorry Amazon, it doesn't take 20 words to say 'this movie is a dog.'"
2,Put me right to sleep.,"This movie is the perfect cure for insomnia. You will get your badly needed slumber during the long and quiet segments with the actors chatting. Suddenly the sound will increase by 100% with dramatic music during the wolf attacks. This will be your alarm clock so you don't oversleep. You will definitely be snoozing for the very disappointing ending. Stay tuned for a brief scene after the credits which may of been included due to audience complaints. It is quite obvious that wolves never act like that, so just think of this as a horror movie or the senior version of ""Teen Wolf"". Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,The Grey is one of Liam's lesser Films,"I gave it a three because there is no 2 1/2!!! I love his movies, but this one just did not deliver. You could just see things before it happened, and the wolf business was a little incorrect, as I raised wolves. They made them supernatural, and it was stupid. If is was not for Liam the movie would have crapped, as it was his boldness and role that made it worth watching. Lets see another ""Taken"" or dark man...."
3,Ambivalent.....,"Was looking forward to renting this as did not catch in theater. Well just finished watching and ambivalent. Was not terrible but not great either. Definitely a film for men and not a date night choice. I like the ""Flight of the Phoenix"" better as a men-against-elements, themselves and ""others"" a better film."
3,The Grey (MOVIE),let me say the movie was good but the ending really suck there could have done better with the end...but am a true liam neeson fan so really dony care what movie he play am going to go see any movie with him cus i know he will be kicking some ass
4,Interesting watchable movie,I enjoyed this movie from the exciting and well done plane crash to the final scene.Locations were great and the story of survival was well carried out.All in all an exciting adventure romp well worth a viewing.
1,simply awful.,"Worst movie I've seen this year. I hate the jerky, grainy filming. I hated the reflection scenes. I like Liam Neeson, but I hate this movie."
1,What a Mess,"This movie tries to immerse you in struggles with nature and and the internal struggles of the characters.It fails. What's left is an action movie with no story, no flow, and no closure."
1,Ugh,"I agree with all the negative reviews. Very depressing, graphic, and it pretty much goes nowhere. When it ended I was like ""what?!?!"". Usually love Liam Neeson movies but this is one is pretty bad."
2,HUH?,"Didn't really get this movie at all. The whole wolf thing confused me. I figured that the wolves would have stopped chasing them once they fed on the other ones. What do I know though, I have never been stranded in the mountains."
3,Terrible Transfer!!!,"> I bought this on Black Friday sale for $7.99 and would have returned it had it not been for the 5.99 Return/Shipping Fee.Despite the cheap price please avoid this version so the studio can pump out a improved scale release.I spent some time tweaking of my Sony XBR909 LCD w/LED Backlighting and I could not get a 'BluRay"" quality picture. The blacks are grainy and lines are blurred.Whites are washed out and facial detail is non existent also there is pixilating sky panning. What I hoped would be beautiful winter scenery contrast against a grim situation storyline became a difficult to appreciate disappointment.3.5 Stars for movie 0 Stars for transfer."
2,Not that good,It was a boring movie I was disappointed I would not tell my friends or family to watch this movie
3,Judge for yourself,"It's interesting to me that a movie can have over 100 5 star reviews, and an equal if not more 1 star review. Personally I enjoyed it. For those of you reviewers who actually took the time and effort to write in ""wolves don't act like that, and etc. etc. etc""', gimme a break. I suppose you're the same people that waste our time arguing that a Great White Shark would NEVER leap out of the water onto a boat or chew on an oxygen tank. 3 words. ""It's a movie!"" Entertainment. It's not a documentary on the habits of wolves in the frozen wastelands of Alaska. Watch a PBS special for that. The acting was awesome and I thought the ending was spectacular. Very bold on the directors part. You either loved it or hated it. All I can say is, most people I've spoken to enjoyed it. While it's definitely not a 5 star flick like the aforementioned Jaws, it at least deserved 3."
2,not my favorite,I like Liam Neeson movies but this one did not live up to my expectaions of his quality of acting
5,Great movie....Mother Nature and man go head-to-head.,Great story.Excellent. Will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson is awesome in this role.Highly recommend.
4,The Grey 'man against nature',Interesting and engossing movie. The characters all change over time and begin to realize what life is and what death is. The cold harsh environment that they are forced into had me hoping the best for them. The fight with the elements and nature brings you to the core of the survival instinct and the desire to fight on no matter the impossible odds. Must See.
4,The Grey- Lots of Action,"The Grey was action-packed but a little slow moving. I like Liam Neeson as an actor- very talented. His part helped maintain my interest which might have waned had any lesser known person had the part. Lots of blood in this movie- a tad gory, but I liked it!!"
2,disappointing,"Overall this was mostly a watchable movie. I dind't really expect it to be good. I watched it merely because Liam Neeson was in it. However, if you prefer movies with resolutions/endings then you should avoid this one."
5,Excellent Movie!,"WOW! So much development to the characters and the enviromental facters, which are constantly a threating presence. Makes you wonders how much you could endure to survive. Unexpected ending. A must for Liam Neeson fans."
2,I did not like it...,I did not like it; the movie was so borring that I failed to stay awaked while watching it last night.
1,"If I could give this dog (pun intended) negative stars, I would","And to think I bought this in HD when I could have watched it for free on Netflix and turned it off after 5 minutes. Wish I could get my money back, Amazon.I Googled "" Alaskan wolf in The Grey"" an found that wolves are scared of their own shadows and would never behave like this.What a massive P.O.S.!EDIT: When I first saw that this pic had come out on Netflix, I skipped it because I'm not terribly impressed with Liam Neeson action pics, But A.O. Scott put it on his top 25 for 2102. Shakes my trust in A.O.'s judgment..."
2,I like Liam Nieeson & survival movies -- but not The Grey.,A waste of acting talent and Alaskan scenery as a pack of wolves with a vendetta of unknown origin make the survivors of a plane crash fight to survive.
2,Scary!,"While the movie was beautifully made and kept my attention, I hated the ending. It did not make me feel good!"
2,yawn,"Aside from a few exciting scenes, this movie was a boring, self-important mess. Most of the screen time is spent showing a bunch men bickering with each other and measuring their dicks as inexplicably homicidal wolves pick them off one by one. Stupid waste of time."
2,The Grey,"To see that none of them survive the plane crash, what was the meaning of this movie? Waste of two hours!"
2,"Watch only the first 1/2, then walk away!","I was horribly disappointed. I love Liam Neeson, and I was so looking forward to this move. But it sucked."
2,Waste of time,The story was convoluted and the movie was too long. Interaction between characters was forced and unbelievable. The effects were okay. I would not waste my time watching it again or encouraging others to spend time and money on this movie.
2,Boring is all I can say.,I thought this movie would be good but instead I found it to be boring... I thought the actinb was good but it was way to dark of a story for me.
2,That all?,"Story was so-so, couldn't believe some of it. I made it to the end, thankfully. I will not be adding this to the BRay collection."
3,The Grey was OK,This movie had a very dark undertone and some of the special effects regarding the wolves seemed unrealistic. I don't think I would spend the time to watch it again.
5,Great Movie,Don't listen to those that gave this a bad review. This movie is suspenseful and will hold your attention to the very end. You will be on the edge of your seat right to the very end. And what movie that has Liam Neeson isn't good. He is a true Movie Star. A great action hero and a mans man. Those that tell you this is not a good movie or just a so-so movie simply didn't like the ending. Because it makes you think. And those who gave this a bad review simply don't like thinking. Trust me. Watch this movie and you will know exactly what I am talking about.
4,Great movie!,"Not running around the house getting snacks, bathroom breaks, folding laundry, diverting myself from a poorly written movie. When i watched this movie it kept me in my seat all the way through.. great ending and kept me guessing throughout, awesome scenery as well. Two thumbs up"
4,The Grey,"Thought it was a good movie, maybe not action packed but a thrill a minute. Not Liam's best but he' s still great in it. Worth watching."
2,Depressing,Watch only if you agree there is no hope and we all all gonna die. Not even God cares according to this. Do not watch if already depressed.
1,GREY is stupid and a waste of time,"This movie never got going and then it died. Stupid premise, unbelievably unbeleivable characters, boring, boring,boring. Liam Neeson must have needed the money. I feel like I wasted mine."
1,The waste of time review,The worst movie I ever rented. The worst movie I ever rented. The worst movie I ever rented.The worst movie I ever rented.
