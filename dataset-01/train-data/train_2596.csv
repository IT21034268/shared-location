1,didn't work,"This simply doesn't work. I used my hands to lift my leg to get into bed - and i thought this would be easier, nope - didn't work at all - plus poorly made and twisted out of shape right away."
2,great idea but...,"i needed help after my stroke, i have tried this product and found it user unfriendly. the foot loop needs to be more formed and larger. i could only get shoe toe in after a lot of difficulty, only to have it slip out when trying to get in the car. suggest testing with different size and aged disabled people. to me i would like a larger preformed foot loop and shorter length handle."
2,Didn't work efficiently,"This device was recommended by a physical therapist that I work with in my schools but my mother in law, who is 87, and living independently with Parkinsons, was unable to successfully position the loop over her foot so I am donating this item to a local rehab facility for their use if needed."
2,"functional, but poorly made","I was looking forward to getting this product because I need it for doing certain stretches & exercises since I have limited mobility. I had used these in physical therapy, but this one was far inferior to the ones I've used in the past. It's flimsy, which makes it uncomfortable to handle. The strap cuts into your hands as you lift. The material is far too thin & of poor quality. Don't waste your money."
1,Leg Lifter,"I purchased this item after having hip replacement surgery. I was unable to lift my leg very high, needed help getting in my van and also my bath tub/shower. It worked fine when I had no shoes on. But, when trying to get into my van (of course, wearing shoes) the loop would not stay open in order to get my foot in while wearing Reeboks (the only type shoe I can wear). It would catch on the rubber soles, and I am unable to use it for the main purpose for which I bought it. I need a product with a rigid, stirrup-type loop for the foot."
5,My cat likes it,My human roommate actually tasted it and he says it tastes terrible and his fish's food tastes a lot better. My cat likes it though and has prefers it over Friskies wet cat food.
1,scrapbook lettering,"The book is somewhat of what it promises but I would not have rated it as 'good' condition - I was dissappointed with this. It was well used and one of the pages slips out. There is also not enough 'prefessional looking' lettering presented and not a lot of variety. Basically, I will be using only 2-3 examples. There is a flowered lettering style in the book which I think is beautiful - maybe that is worth the price I paid.."
4,A lot of useful information in a small package,"This is a very useful book that gives you wonderful guidelines as to when it is time to repot, shape, water, fertilize, etc... It also gives you an idea of what a lot of different species of trees need and prefer. Wonderful book. I am very glad that I bought it."
1,Defiantly not readable,"What a disappointment. The book can with a lot of pages stuck together. As Itried to open them up, they got worse and worse tearing the pages. It's abig loss for me. Defiantly not readable"
3,Out of date,"This book needs a re-write to bring it up to the latest SQL standards. If you are still using Pre-SQL92 systems, this book is a pretty good reference.However, it leaves out important new information such as the new JOIN syntax.I recommend you check other texts to ensure this is the *one* that you want."
4,Not for beginners but great book,Not for beginners but great bookNot for beginners but great bookNot for beginners but great bookNot for b
4,Good Non-product specific intro to SQL,Good book if you are 100% new to SQL and the concept of queries. Not good if you're looking for a more specific language techniques for particular brands of sql. This book serves well as a nice thick primer before moving on to a more product specific topics.
3,conversational vs programming concepts,"The explanations are presented in conversational language. This made it difficult for me to understand some of the concepts. I had to ""translate"" the explanations into more precise and concise language based on concepts familiar to programmers before I could grasp the ideas with confidence (assuming my translations are correct)."
1,Flimsy,We end up having to empty these bags daily because they aren't study enough for kitchen use. This after double-bagging. Would not recommend.
3,"Nice idea, didn't work for us","I really like the idea of these bags, but for us, they didn't work...before these we used regular trash bags, which we always purchased the ones with the cinch ties. With these, we have to leave a lot extra bag out of the trash can so we can have enough to tie shut, which means we go through these twice as fast. The quality seems fine for what they are, but we won't be purchasing them again, as they just cause too much frustration for us."
1,Tall Kitchen bags don't fit anything!,"I got these bags to use in a regular tall kitchen bag and they don't work. They don't fit any trash can that would be considered a ""tall kitchen bag."" They aren't long enough to get to the bottom of the trash can and they aren't big enough around either. Don't buy these if that's what you are going to use them for. I use the 33 gallon bags for a larger trash can I have and they work great, but the tall kitchen size are pretty much worthless."
4,Works,I live in the tropics where biodegrading happens FAST! These bags worked without biodegrading in my trash can. They fit the can perfectly and actually stay in place unlike my old drawstring bags. I have chosen to amend my stuff everything you can fit into the bag philosophy and so far (1 box used) have had no breaks or leaks. I am surrounded by the ocean and I rarely forget that we are literally trashing our oceans daily. It feels good knowing I can do one less harmful thing and is certainly worth the change.
3,Slightly Smaller than Average,"Like somebody else wrote on the review, it's more easier to break than plastic trash bags does. But it's not impossible to use... Just need to be a bit careful. Do not let sharp edges touch directly to the bag.And also somebody else wrote on the review, I think this bag is slightly smaller than the average tall kitchen bag. I snag this bag over my kitchen trash can and it comes off from the edge whenever I throw in something heavy. If manufacturer can make this bag a little bit bigger, at least as big as average tall kitchen bag size, I'll give 4 stars to this product."
2,Green Yes tough No!,These bags make your carbon footprint smaller but if you expect a strong bag forget it!
4,Good product,"If you're using something bigger than the small compost bin and have plenty of compost, this is a great product."
1,Falls apart before use... a waste of money,"Bought a case of these bags. They rip when going into the trash can. Many tore just getting them off the roll. If you create a small amount of trash and the bag is in the can for more than a few days, they deteriorate. Rip when pulling from the trash can. Had to double bag most upon removal or put on a plastic bag. Throughly disappointed in the whole experience. Think they are a waste of money."
2,Quality has declined - they leak now!,"I used to buy these at a local shop and was generally happen with them, even though they ARE very thin and tear if you look at them wrong.I started using Amazon Subscribe & Save and after the first couple shipments the quality of the kitchen bag seems to have declined drastically. I use them for kitchen compost and take them out every couple days. However, if you put anything in that's wet - like coffee grounds - the bag seeps pretty badly and the container gets wet, encouraging all kinds od gross stuff to grow in their. They seem even thinner now, if that's possible.I used to be a big advocate of these, but because of these issues, I just can't recommend these bags."
1,They rip to shreds when you separate them at the perforations,"I wanted to love these bags, but the truth is that I put more of them in the garbage than I used for garbage because simply pulling them apart at the perforations caused tears to start, and once the tears started they just kept getting longer and longer as I every so gently tried to open the bag in a way that would salvage it. I'll look for other compostable garbage bags. These ones need some work!"
1,Bags do not compost even in a year,"I have a very active compost bin, complete with red wriggler worms. I bought a set of these bags, some kitchen size, some leaf size, and dog waste size. All fail miserably to compost. After more than a year, when I was turning the oldest compost into bins of humus, I found loads of unaffected plastic bags, this color.And there's another thing - the kitchen size does not fit the kitchen receptacle. It has to stretch tightly to ""fit"", and they tear in the process, often as not, since they used extremely thin material.Don't buy these. Say what they will, they are impervious to rot after more than a year in a warm, moist, heavily populated compost bin."
2,Not very strong,"I had been using another type of eco friendly garbage bag, but they seem to be unavailable from all sources, so I ordered these instead. They are not very strong. They don't have handles, so they don't stay in place very well. With the other brand of bags we were able to take out three full liners from the kitchen cans at a time. With bio bags we are lucky to make it to the herbie with one...they need to be gently removed and then held on the top and from the bottom and walk fast and hope they don't leak. These are less expensive than the previous brand used, but are definitely an inferior product. I think I'll keep looking for a better eco option."
4,Only Compostable Option,"This seems to be the only option for readily available compostable tall kitchen bags. Other similar bags listed here are biodegradable, but not compostable. So, this appears to be the only legal option for residents of San Francisco, California. The other bags contain plastic, these don't.That said, they are pretty good bags. Sure, they are thin, and can get clammy when wet. But, I've not yet had one break. They only need to make it from the can to the curb, so that's not much to ask. I just noticed that they claim to have been recently redesigned. The size is also a bit different (they are now a bit taller and skinnier). And, they come in a smaller box. I haven't tried these new bags yet.My only complaint was that they were made in Norway, so they have to be shipped quite a distance. How good for the environment can that be? The new bags don't list a production country on the outside of the package. Are they now made in the USA?"
2,Too weak,It was so weak that i had to replace them at least three times with other brand trash bags. The only reason i didn't give it a one star is cause they're trying to produce a biodegradable product.
3,NOT 13 gallon!,"These bags are probably only about 9 or 10 gallon. Doesn't fill my trash can! A they ripped when I tried to stretch them around the edge.---------- Update 12/12/12I've started using 2 of these bags in my large trash can - one for trash and the other for recycling. I have them clipped on the edge with binder clips. It's a makeshift way of doing things but it's worked for the past few months.I increased my review to 3 starts just because I am now using these instead of regular trash bags. In addition, I use them for emptying out my rabbit's litter box. I have the throw the litter away within at least 12 hours or the bags disintegrate and the litter ends up all over the floor. Ew.But all in all, I feel better about not throwing away so many plastic bags when most of my waste is paper based anyway."
1,Much too small,The problem with Bio Bag for standard 13 gallon kitchen use is it is very small and cannot be fitted to a 13 gallon trash container. Save yourself a lot of frustration and skip it. It only fits a 9 gallon container properly.
3,They biodegrade in your trash can,"These were an impulse purchase for me; I normally buy Bag to Nature, but am still open to other brands. This brand was in stock in a store I was in, so I picked it up.I find that not only do these tear easily as you lift them out of your trash can, they also may have dissolved already on the bottom if you've thrown away anything wet or damp and don't tend to produce enough trash to change it more than once a week.Double-bagging works, but it's too expensive. I'd rather buy a biodegradable bag that's a bit more sturdy.However, I did find that being conscientious about how much moisture I was throwing away did help.I live alone, so don't produce a lot of garbage. If you have a family and change your trash more often than I do (and can afford to go through these bags quickly), you probably won't have any problems at all.Plus the size is good - it's a perfect fit for a typical ""tall"" kitchen garbage can."
5,These are very good bags,These bags are very good for it's price and it's helping the environment by investing in composting products. I just use these for food scraps and it's great.
3,"Not very sturdy, but....","I suppose it depends on your needs. There's only my wife and I, and we don't generate that much trash. So we probably expect one of these bags to last about a full week - which is FAR too long. If you're dumping anything moist into them (coffee grounds for instance), forget it. They'll begin to break down almost immediately. Every time we'd change out the bag - it had tears and was already falling apart.If you need to change your garbage bag every 2-3 days, you're probably alright. But beyond that, count on some troubles."
4,Too small for tall kitchen size,"I love these bags, because I can finally compost kitchen scraps without a big mess. But the 13 gallon size is a lot smaller than a polyethelene plastic bag of the same size. It doesnt fit into my 13 gallon trash can, not even close. I'd say the 13 gallon bags are more like 8 gallon bags. Perfect for a 5 gallon bucket."
3,"Not perfect, but good.","I like that they are not harmful for the earth, but they don't stay put in the trash can, which can cause a mess."
1,bags broke.,"These bags broke. Maybe they already started to biodegrade. I am a believer in buying green products. But they have to perform. Also, these bags were a little pricey."
2,Meh,"The bags are not very strong- if you fill the bag more than 3/4 full the bag will tear. It also does nothing to mask odors emitted from your garbage. I will not be buying this product again. There has to be another environmentally friendly bag out there that won't break and tear so easily. I used to have one bag of garbage a week, now i have 3 or 4 a week with these bags because they don't hold anything."
1,Do not buy these bags,"I was very excited to have the option for a biodegradable bag, but they are just not worth it.Don't even try to put anything in them.They are just to flimsy.You can't double bag them if they tear right awayI would give them a negative star if possible"
2,Not Tall Enough for Tall Kitchen Cans,"These bags, in contrast to their description, are NOT tall. In my standard kitchen trash can, they only reach about three quarters the way down. Combined with the thin walls of the bags, this means that if you try to compress the trash even slightly you simply rip the bag. Likewise, if you put anything with any weight in the trash, the bag simply stretches and rips.Biodegradability is a wonderful idea, and if these bags were about one third again as long as their current length, they would be functional. With a little more tensile strength(in addition to the added length), they would be even better (thicker walls or stronger plastic). As it is, at this length they are barely usable."
4,"Good product, some effort required","These are 13-gallon garbage bags made out of corn. They're completely biodegradable and completely compostable. They're not quite as sturdy as plastic trash bags, but they hold up better than other people have said. No big deal. Double-bag them. I'd rather have two bags made of corn in a landfill than one bag made of plastic."
1,only 12 bags,"I use BioBag dog bags and love them, so I tried the kitchen bags also. The dog bags are sturdy and don't tear at all, but the kitchen bags seem to be made from something else. They don't fit in an average kitchen garbage bin and they also tear extremely easily. If you are using them strictly as compost bags and only putting scraps in them I'm sure they'd do fine, but they shouldn't be used for an average kitchen garbage bag.Also, it only contains 12 bags. Add the price of shipping and this becomes very expensive for a bag only to be used in a compost pile."
4,Not a plastic bag!,"I have been using canvas grocery bags for a few years now, and it bothered me to still use standard plastic trash bags. These are great, though they aren't terribly strong. I find that the more recycyling and composting I do, the less trash I have anyway, though. My husband and I end up with about one bag of trash per 2 weeks. By the end of the 2 weeks, these bags are starting to weaken and you want to be careful when taking them out. Otherwise, it's worth it, knowing we're not adding more plastic to the landfills. Every little bit helps."
2,"nice idea, but can't be used like a regular kitchen bag gets used","i love biobags, and use the doggie bags religiously. however, the kitchen bags don't hold up to being stuffed or overstuffed. they stick, rip, leak, and have only worked for me (i use a simplehuman butterfly step can) when i double-bag. like the other reviewed said, they would work great if you are just putting compost in, or in my case i use it to line my bedroom trash and that works great. they can't be filled to the max with heavy trash."
1,There is better quality elsewhere,"I personally love Rimsky-Korsakov but this was an experience in knowing who the conductors and orchestra are and how they are integral in making the music phenomenal. My favorite is the Capriccio Espagnol and I have it on another CD, thankfully. If you do buy this, you might want to set the base very low as it tends to overpower the treble. Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra did an outstanding job with Sheherazade ~ I'd suggest looking to them if you like Rimsky-Korsakov as I do and want to hear his compositions played with expressive, beautiful precision."
3,ringer,"its okay for the price, but just ok. not very shiny. so we actually ended up buying a different ring. we got a tungston one instead, better look and still good price."
2,Not like the picture.,"We liked the picture online, and so we ordered it. It wasn't shiny like the picture made us think.It looks faded or dull. So not my choice for a wedding band, but...ya know."
1,Not so great service.......,Received the ring in great time. It was as advertised. We immediately returned the ring for a different size - mailed as directed. The company say they still haven't received the return-it has been almost a month now. We will not reorder from this company again unless they receive the ring and replace it with another size immediately.
3,dangerous!,"I've just received this (fast shipping results) but I didn't notice the (in shower) portion of the title. I bought this for my dad, who has dry skin. He's OLD! The last thing he needs is to slip in the shower and dislocated his hip. Olay is a wonderful, trustworthy product, but it's very dangerous to apply it in the shower since it leaves the tub floor very very slippery."
2,MD People,"I have dry skin and bought this product to help. Good when put on after a shower. However, wears off within a couple of hours. Makes shower VERY slippery. Smells good. Wont purchase again."
3,My Bras,"Had cotton lined Carnival bras before, style 600, and would prefer the cotton bras to the ones I received. Am not totally satisfied with the bras I received as they are all nylon and very hot in summer and not as comfortable as style 600. If you have style 600, I would love to buy it."
1,Lesson Learned,"Because this order did not come with a packing slip, I'm going to presume that it means that it cannot be returned. This bad purchase taught me that 1) can't buy bras on-line (as you can't see, touch, feel, and fit)! It did not fit and it was donated to charity; 2) A picture cannot provide an accurate description of a product (it looked and felt nothing like what you would expect from looking at the photo)."
2,Jolly Pet 6 inch Tug-n-Toss,"I bought my two Golden Retrievers each a Tug-n-Toss ball. They enjoy playing with them, but usually instead of retrieving them by the handle, they grip the ball in their jaws partially deflating it, which would not be a problem except that the material it is made from is soft and easily punctured by their teeth, enabling the ball to become stuck and they can't let go without help."
3,Destructable,"My German Shepherd had this ball for all of 3 hours before the handle was chewed off and there were holes all over it. It's about a month old now, and don't know how much life it has in it? She could destroy it quickly if she set out to do so. And the 6"" size is really too small for her. She's small at 65 pounds, so I thought 8"" would have been too much...it would have been better."
2,Not as great as I was hoping,"My (now 6mo) pitbull-mutty-mix loves when I bring this ball out, but she does nothing but play ""keep-away"" with it so she can go off somewhere and chew on the handle. She was able to chomp a chunk of the corner off the handle in no time, so this toy's a gonner now...As far as the ""Jolly"" line of toys go, we both really like the Jolly Pet Teaser Ball. My girl goes nuts for it, the plastic is VERY hard so can't destroy it--although, if left to settle down with the ball, she can scrape curls of plastic off of it. That's when the toy gets put away until next time..."
3,"Jolly Pet 4.5"" Tug-n-Toss Review","My three dogs, all of which are under 17 lbs, enjoy playing with this ball. Most of the handle was chewed off in a matter of minutes, but there is still enough remaining that they are able to carry it around. It would probably be best to pick this toy up when you are not actively playing with your dog(s). Otherwise, if your dog is a powerful or persistent chewer, the handle more than likely will get destroyed.Despite the handle issue, the rest of the ball had held up wonderfully."
1,cheaply made -- didn't last 15 minutes,"My pup is a 1 yr. old jack russell/hound mix. While the product arrived pretty much the next day (great customer service), within 15 minutes of giving it to my dog, he chewed off a sizeable chunk of the handle and punctured the main ball. If your dog is any kind of moderate to heavy chewer, don't waste the money on the Jolly Pet Tug-n-Toss. A friend with a 2 yr. old german shepherd has the jolly ball horse toy that has the same design, is cheaper, and much, much, sturdier. I recommend that instead."
5,My tough terrier loves this!,"Finding tough toys for a large terrier isn't easy, but the Jolly Ball works great. My dog will chew on (and chew off) the handle if given the chance, but fortunately this ball is made from tough rubber and stands up to some very rough treatment. I now have two Jolly Balls: one where I've cut the remaining handle off (not easy because of the durable material used) and one with the handle intact. Does Jolly Ball make a version without a handle? For aggressive chewers that might be a better option, but still, this is one great dog toy. My dog prefers it over all his other toys."
4,Interactive fun ... NOT a chew toy!,"This is a wonderful toy, especially for water play. My 50 lb. mixed breed dog loves to chase and carry it in the pool or at the beach. Inflatable balls are out of the question, because he punctures them immediately. The Tug-n-Toss, while not cheap, works out to be a much better value than buying a new ball every other day or so. It floats even when filled with water, but unfortunately it gets pretty heavy to toss. Otherwise, we'd have the horse size instead of the 8"", which is really too small for Bouli because he can shove it against things and bite it. Another issue is that he and I both want the handle. ;-) When we finish playing in the water, I put the ball away, because he'd have the handle off within minutes if I left it for him to chew. As it is, the toy has a lot of bites and punctures but is still good for play after a year."
2,Easily Destroyed by our Golden Retriever,"Based on reviews, I thought this would be a great toy for our ball-loving 1yo Golden retriever. Nope. She loved it all right, but she loved it so much that she gnawed the handle off within a day, and then worked and worked at the holes until it had a hole about 5"" across. At that point it was useless and I was tired of bits of plastic all over the place (and plenty in her poop too). Maybe I should only give it one star, but it is well built and might be less destructible if you don't have a crazy chewer like our dog.At the same time I bought the 6"" jolly ball with the rope through it. She chewed the rope out of it within a few hours but the actual ball is still in one piece. These balls are quite heavy. I worry about her teeth when she carries them around in her mouth."
4,Izzy loves her jolly tug n toss,"Izzy loves her jolly ball. It's a blast to kick it and throw it around in the yard and have her run around with it with the handle in her mouth. The ball is strictly outdoors here and last about one season in our new Orleans heat and rain. I uploaded pictures of her playing with it. It's super fun outdoor toy. The only reason I gave it four stars is the handle gives out because that is where dogs chew and drag it, reinforcing the handle would extend the longevity of the ball."
1,Dog enjoyed it.... for 15 minutes,Our dog liked it but had the handle tore off in 15 minutes. Thought it'd be more durable even for our rambuncious pet.
2,Disappointed.,My Malamute immediately started to chew the handle part and ate some pieces so I cut off the handle but she was eating the ball still so we had to throw it away. So it lasted only 10 minutes. This ball is not good for chewers but very fun toy for many other dogs.
2,Ball didn't hold up,"This small Jolly Ball did not hold up. Our small jack russel and schnauzer chewed the ring right off it, and then had pieces of the handle all over the house. The larger jolly balls are good. Except the pink ones. They seem to fall apart twice as fast as the purple ones"
3,"Great ball, not so great handle.","Ball does not deflate, and is a wonderful ball. Handle is of the same material, just more dense, and a 26 pound cocker spaniel chewed off the handle with his sharp teeth. The handle needs to be made of a tougher stuff, though the ball part is fine. The cocker loved it for the handle, but it didn't last a week. So overall, I liked the flexibility of the ball, but the handle just couldn't take it. I purchased two, the largest and the next to largest. The cocker wanted the largest one, for 26 pounds he is quite the tough little guy, he is vision impaired and loved the bigger ball he could see, and he could carry it, until he ate the handle off."
4,I have a big dog,"Genny is a 115 pound shepherd/mastiff. She loves the big Jolly ball. We have had two so far and we don't play ""tug"" with it. It takes her just about 4 months to sever the handle from the ball just by shaking it around. It would be good if you could strengthen the area where the handle meets the ball."
1,Beware of this product,"The ball is cheap, my dog ate a hole in it within 3 minutes. I had to worry the next 2 days to make sure pass it through his system. I wrote the company, I never heard back. I have been purchasing these balls for the pass 12 years. They use to last 6 to 8 months because the balls were made of good rubber/plastic. Now they just seem cheap"
1,HORRIBLE PET TOY,"I ordered this toy for my 2 year old labrador and she managed to chew off the handle in less than 10 minutes! How is it that a toy made for a ""Large to X-Large Dog"" can be destroyed in such a short amount of time? I contacted the company, but no response. I DO NOT recommend this toy for any dog over 30lbs."
1,Didn't last 30 min.,Bought this for our 11 mo. old German shepard. In less than 30 minutes he chewed off the handle. I had stop him before he go to full. We have had Jolly Balls before which were round and very durable. They lasted a long time but not this throwable one.
4,Good for a Rottweiler Toy,"I bought this for an 20 mo. Rottweiler and he LOVED it. Played with it to exhaution and hasn't lost intersest after a month. But, it is almost totally trashed. It's not easy to find a toy tough enough for a Rottie."
1,Not very durable,My Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy tore a big chunk out of the handle after about hour of us playing with it.
3,not for chewers!,"I have a golden retriever, who loves to chew. He loves his jolly pet, however it is now an outside toy only because after awhile it began to smell, like cat urine. We are on our second one and continue to have the same problem. My parents have my dogs brother (littermate), he is also a chewer and managed to chew thru the handle within a couple of minutes. i would recommend this toy as a toy for play with supervision."
5,One of the best dog toys ever,These things will outlast your dog.My dogs (labs) love them because they float and bounce. The large handle allows them to pick up a ball that's much too large too fit in their mouths. Then a prey drive kicks in and they shake them vigorously.I can see that a lot of thought went into this product.
2,Not for puppies,"8 week old puppy loved to play with this toy, but she destroyed it in less than a week. I caught her chewing on bitten off chunks of plastic. That was a waste of $9.00."
2,My dog won't touch it,"There is something about the smell of this toy that is making my dog refuse to have anything to do with it. He usually isn't picky about toys, but he hates this one. Also, the handle is really small and the one time he did try to play with it, he couldn't figure it out (to be fair, he isn't the brightest bulb)."
2,Not as durable as promised,"I almost didn't buy this ball based on the reviews. BUT, I find most people will generally tell you about a negative experience more often than a positive one. I disregard a lot of the negative reviews because people like to complain. I was wrong and should rethink my theory. hahaMy dog is an 80 lb, 8 month old, Staffy. He's a power chewer. I took his indestructoball away because it's noisy in the house. The tug-n-toss seemed like a durable and quieter alternative. Damn, I was wrong again.Oddly enough, 24 hours after I gave him the tug-n-toss ball, the handle survived. The ball? Well, the ball has a about 3 inch hole with jagged edges. He's a bit upset that I took it away from him so I gave him back the indestructoball (it really is indestructable). I may have to put carpet down to dull the noise but my baby is happy."
1,DON'T BOTHER,Nope... this toy lasted less than 5 minutes with my 10 month old labrador and the handle was gone. UGH!!!
2,Dog loves it,My 100 pound Olde English Bulldogge a huge chewer after 1 day ripped a huge hole in it. I gave it 2 stars because it lasted over 24 hours and he LOVED it.
2,Cannot recommend this dog toy,"I bought this item for my Mastiff/Lab mix to play with outside. Within literally 30 seconds the top was destroyed and it can no longer be picked up, much less tossed around. True my dog can be an aggressive chewer, but he has had some toys for months and although marred up a bit, still in relatively good condition. Cannot recommend as a pet toy, it's too heavy for small dogs and larger dogs will tear it apart."
3,Tough on lawn,My dog likes the tug n toss. It is to heavy for a 20 pound dog. When throwing the ball I have to be very careful that he does not get hit by the ball because of it's weight. When the handle of the tug n toss strikes the ground it leaves behind divots in the lawn.
1,My Dogs thought it sucked....,"My dogs refused to play with a pair purchased (one for each of them) - I think they didn't like it because it wasn't easily picked up with their mouths and kinda unwieldy compared to their usual toys (tennis balls, rope toys, squeaky balls, etc). It has that nub at the end so they can pick it up - but they didn't think it was fun at all... Attempted to make the pair more to their liking by tying rope toys to the nub, but that just turned their beloved rope toys into duds."
1,Handle gone in 5 minutes,"Don't let your dog have access to this unsupervised, or like mine, you will wind up with a ball with holes in it. The handle was gone in about ten minutes. The handle is hollow and easy for a large dog to chew through."
2,Jolly Ball,"unfortunatley the Jolly ball only lasted about 6 days without tearing, and both dods loose intest once this happens, its my 2 ball in a month, I wont be buy this one again."
5,Three years and going strong,"This was one of the first toys we got for our then 6 month old boxer. Its her favorite toy, there years later even, and barely shares it with our other boxer.She chews on it, carries it, we play fetch with it. One of her favorite things to do with it is deflate it with her jaws and watch it re inflate."
1,BAD TASTE,"It was surely a shock that made me anxious to hear it but unfortunately it left me with a bad taste!! That's because I expected much more participation from Scorpions for such an album. Even the most loyal Scorpion's fan should be honest and express his disappointment. Was the band present during the recording??? Maybe K. Meine was, but the others? All in all the Berliner Philarmoniker Orchestra's classical performance was great."
2,Nice try but definitely second bext,"I was very interested to here what this CD was like. Having bought Metallica S&M and listened to that almost incessantly for a month. I wondered whether The Scorpions were attempting to reach the same giddy heights or whether they were just cashing in. I have to say, disappointingly, the latter is the case. There are a couple of stand-out tracks (esp. Send Me An Angel which earns one of the above stars by itself) but the majority sound like they've simply hired rent-an-orchestra and left them to it. This is in stark contrast to the Metallica offering which blends the sweeping strings and leaping horns with the original music in such a way as to make them seemingly inseperable. Maybe this isn't the fault of the Scorps themselves but they should never have allowed this CD to have been released. Lastly, 10 tracks?! Come one - you're just not trying! Sorry lads, thanks but no thanks."
2,CD Purchase,I bought two cd's from two different places and both were listed as being new cd's but one of them was a used one. I did not find this acceptable as they should have been honest. I paid the price of a new one for a used one and I should have paid less because the used ones were a lot cheaper. Lucky for me the cd is good and I really enjoy listening to it as I love the Scorpions music but I am not sure if I can ever trust the company that I ordered it from. The used ones were going for about $2-$3 while the new ones were about $9.
1,dynamite!,"Just when you think the scorpions couldn't do worst...they prove you wrong!Even Metallica's s&m; is better...close but still.I am sure that it was a great experience to live, for the band and the audience, because that type of event is always unique and can bring strong emotions-unless you have a dumb..s sitting next to you, drinkin' beer and screaming every five minutes Dynamiiiiiiite!!-but on cd...for me it doesn't do it,but it probably is a treasure for those who were there.Now, I'm not gonna start the debat with DEEP PURPLE and the LSO(1999) but I was there at the Royal Albert Hall and that's why I can understand the concept and the thrill of holding the recording of such concerts...but still DEEP PURPLE 's symphonic album features something that neither Scorpions or Metallica holds...and this is an ORIGINAL PIECE OF MUSIC CREATED FOR A GROUP AND A ORCHESTRA!"
1,What Happened,"This album has only maybe a few songs that is listenable! This might of been a long time coming for them, but could of waited even longer before releasing it!.BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT! I am a die hard Scorpions fan for the last 20 years but what happened boys are you calling it Quits or what? Who ever that is Klaus has on vocal's needs singing lessons..Klaus Meine doesn't need any help on vocals. With a battle cry voice like he has, the Scorpions will always be on top. Unlees they keep making albums like this! Not a good album for any Scorpions fan new or old.This c.d. should not of been released. Hopefully the next album they do is nothing like this one!I have NEVER taken a Scorpions album back to a music store yet,but this one is going back!"
3,As a Scorpions fan,"I found this CD quite good,but there are a lot of safe songs on here that fit too easily with the orchestra, I would have liked to see more of their rocky songs transformed - much like Metallica did.But for all true Scorpions fans,definitely worth a listen"
5,"Somehow, the Scorpions managed to be even more epic","This album combines the already awesome Scorpions with an epic full orchestra. It's so good, it'll make you want to punch a baby seal, just to feel how awesome that would be. Seriously, if you like the Scorpions, even a little, BUY THIS ALBUM."
5,Fantastic!,"This rendition of Chopin's Etudes is surely one of the best i've ever listened to. Andrei Gravilov has an extraodinary technique and every Etude is perfomed not only perfectly but with so much passion and fire to astonish the listener. At the moment i own nine sets of these beautiful pieces and this one along with Boris Berezovsky and Juana Zayas is the best in my opinion. All the others (Pollini, Peraya, Ashkenazy, Chiu, Cziffra, Cherkassky, Virsaladze, Tomassi)are really notable and very different. I love all of them though Berezosky, Gravilov, Zayas, Lugansky and Neuburger stand a part for the passion overall, the lyricism and beyond-descripion technique displayed.Highly recommended!"
4,Take no prisoners approach to Chopin,"Andrei Gavrilov starts the first etude in C major and right away captivates with his barnstorming technique. I can appreciate a more delicate, poetic style and I have experienced recordings in that department yet at the same time it's a thrill to hear a pianist out to impress.It would be a disservice to write off this recording as just high-energy and nothing more. The less hectic pieces are played beautifully and the full pathos of the slower etudes find Gavrilov completely in tune with the music. This is one approach to Chopin among many and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The sound quality is very good digital."
3,The technique is just a part of the musical lexicon,"Andrei Gavrilov possesses a bravura technique and an absolute domain of the musical form, that feature is a virtue but also may work out as failure at the moment to over emphasize crescendos or prolongated tremolos. Let's state once more: Chopin is not Liszt. The mission of any pianist is not produce applauses from the gallery, but to create atmospheres, to play these Etudes is like to be in front of a huge canvas, where you must employ every Etude with its own tonality, either more or less.Recommended, although my favorite set is by far Samson Francois, still available in Amazon."
2,a dissenting opinion,"Gavrilov has technique to burn and he displays it in all these etudes, but don't be deceived, He utterly fails to deliver and to commumunicate the emotional core of these pieces. Chopin composed them as a means to an end. Gavrilov treats them as ends in themselves. That is his problem."
5,Essential reading for any psychotherapist,"I have been working as a therapist for over 10 years and, to my shame, have only now started to read any of Rogers' work. This selection of his writings strikes me as amazingly modern and relevant to the work of anyone in the 'helping' professions. I have been struck by the almost spiritual quality of his thoughts, and the way in which he cuts through any psychological or psychotherapeutic dogma. I have been truly inspired by this book and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in human relationships; I believe that anyone would come away with new and profound insights that would challenge, stimulate and reassure. An excellent book!"
4,carl rogers,"Though the book is lengthy, I enjoyed his tone more than other physchologists of his time"
4,Great framework for testing any business idea.,"I used this book to road test a business idea I've had in mind for a long time. The book will give you a good notion of the strength and weaknesses of your opportunity and if used pro actively, it will help you clear the most important `unknowns' that you need to know about before spending time and money in a business venture. I would recommend this book to everyone (thinking of) starting a business. It provides a great framework to road test any (crazy) business idea at a very affordable loss."
5,A definite must have for current or future entrepreneur!,"Very interesting and helpful book to make sure all main aspects of new business opportunity are covered. Before jumping into business creation I believe this book definitely provides a very good reality check, for example, if the business idea you plan to pursue is really for you, matches your aims and whether you have thought of all main aspects such as future market and industry prospects, etc. The book is very easy and pleasant to read and provides many inspiring and practical examples. Therefore a definite must have to anyone who thinks of pursuing her/his business opportunity."
5,A Must-Have Before Writing Your Business Plan and Launching,"As an entrepreneur myself and author and instructor of entrepreneurship, I have found great value in The New Business Road Test. Mullins is right that too many people proceed to business planning and even launching without first going through critical preliminary steps that address the key issue of viability. He provides a helpful road map for how to do so. In so doing, he has made a great contribution to the field. Mullins brings his own entrepreneurial experience as well as years of teaching to bear here. The result is a helpful framework, tons of useful information, and a hands-on tool that can add great value almost immediately. Get this book and use it to screen, hone, and improve your ideas. You'll be glad you did."
2,A confusing guide....,"I bought this book after looking through a library copy. It seemed great, with lots of locations, tips, etc. and sites off the beaten track. However, actually using it was another story! A number of the directions to sites were either confusing, vague, or outright incorrect (wrong mile marker #'s for turn-offs, for example). Descriptions of fabulous scenery turned out to be highly exaggerated (in our opinion) and not worth the effort to find them. There was one site we never found (Blue Lagoon), as getting there turned out to require a major several-mile hike over sharp lava rocks after bumping down a very difficult-to-find dirt road (we learned this later, after giving up). The book's directions there were confusing and little help and a local we asked after the fact, told us the site was nice, but not nearly as fantastic as described.The book was useful in listing places to check out, but to get to them it's better to get a good map, ask a local, and cross your fingers."
2,Review of Hawaii - The Big Island Trailblazer,"The content of this book is very good. However, I expected the illustrations/pictures that were in the book to be in color instead of black and white."
2,Really? Only black and white photos of Hawaii?,"I purchased this book and ""No Worries Hawaii"" by the same authors. I cannot imagime why you would even bother to include photographs of a tropical island in a travel book if you are only going to print them in black and white. The photos in ""No Worries Hawaii"" are in color and are lovely. To be honest I haven't even spent much time reading the content of this book because the black and white photos are depressing. I feel like I am reading a book printed back in the 1940's. I have however found ""No Worries Hawaii"" to be very good and probably the only book I needed."
5,They got it right,"Another Trailblazer guide we really enjoyed. Whoever named this place the BIG island sure got it right. And so did the authors of this book. It's clear they know their stuff, there are so many outings described inside.This guide is arranged geographically so that no matter where you are you have the details on what there is to do and pictures showing what it looks like. What surprised us the most is that the book wasn't just about hiking, snorkeling (the best) and biking (wish we had our mountain bikes along), but it is also a great book for driving around and covers the neat little towns.We bought this book at the last minute and are glad we did. If you are spending all the money it takes to get to Hawaii, it is a smart choice to pony up a few more bucks and drop it in your carry-on. We also like the big maps and the way the book is written -- lots of interesting details.We will have to go back to see it all. The volcano area was truly wonderous!!"
1,What a Waste of 7 Bucks,"I can not imagine how this author managed to get published. Every day I read about deserving, talented individuals who wait years before finding someone willing to publish their work.And then there's Ms. Glad. Someone's daughter?I will never purchase another e-book unless I am able to do a chapter preview- I was either led astray by the ""excerpt"" or completely out of my mind."
1,NO PERSONALIZATION!,"There was no way for me to personalize this CD for a child named Cassie! I thought perhaps there was a pause when the childs name was announced - in this case:sarah. Apparently, this is not the case. I will be sending it back for sure. This was purchased by Amazon.com who in the past has been 100% reliable until now."
5,"Nite ""N"" Day",This is the most informative tape out there. It makes you laugh and cry. It makes you want to jump in a car and drive to the south!
1,Don't spend your money.,"We opened the package, and I stuck my finger in so my kids would see how it works. Next my 10-year-old daughter put her finger in, pushed the bar down, and the blade broke. Literally, the second time it was used it broke. Something better purchased in the dollar section of a store (or not at all)."
5,Favorite CD,This is my absolute favorite Christmas CD. I can play it over and over and never get tired of it. I am ordering multiple copies of it this year to give as gifts.
5,"High quality, good looking set","Before this set, I settled for less expensive sets from big box stores. I received these as a gift two years ago and they have held up great! You can feel that these are made from high quality materials that will last. When not in use, I hang the tools on the hooks that are pre-installed on my W grill, so they are protected by the grill cover. During the midwest winter, I store them in my garage. A little care, and these will last. Great set and highly recommend for a wedding party gift!"
5,Cut off switch,Seems very well made. I have had good luck with Flaming River products in the past. Bought the switch to isolate winches from power when they aren't being used on an ATV.
4,"Nice, solid switch","Excellent little switch to use for a battery cut-off in an old car you don't use every day. Solid construction, seems well made - the only drawback was getting that rubber sealer cuff onto the key. But it finally went on and everything works well."
3,Omaggio,"It's a good book but it sort of dismisses anything other than the communicative method as ineffective. it doesn't address how to teach AP classes effectively and it seems to be geared more towards an esl teacher rather than a foreign language teacher. Sometimes the communicative method bypasses the brain and kind of dummies up instruction. There is an important gap in how to teach grammar rules, and AP type test problems also I am unsatisfied with the material on how to teach writing. But this is the only methods text any important university is using nowadays, that will change once the communicative method goes out of fashion in a year or two."
2,Ehhh,"This book is okay and only okay. It's not very practical; it does not really teach you how to teach a foreign language. The book errs regarding its definitions of language acquisition versus language learning. It is apparent to me as a reader and as a teacher that the author has not spent enough time in an actual classroom with actual language learners. The book is also lacking a 'why'. Why learn a new language? Why does this matter to students today? As any parent or teacher will tell you, why is the first, last and most asked question. ""Ways With Words,"" by Shirley Brice Heath, has a lot more helpful information when it comes to language learning than this text."
1,Boring,"This will in no way help you as a teacher of a foriegn language, unless you are sleep deprived that is. Zzzzzzz..."
2,Loss of time,"Too theoretical. Omaggio explains all kinds of ways to teach, but nothing that would really help you to become a good teacher!"
5,Great resource,This text is chock full of relevant information for langauge educators and language educators to be. I especially enjoy the online workbook which is an amazing commplement to an informative text such as this. I appreciate the author's inclusion of numerous schools of thought for those who might be new to this information. Great tertiary level text
2,Septuigent,I was disappointed greatly in the quality of this product. Ink was pale and fading in spots. It is only the Old Testament. Font is very small in English and much bigger in Greek (which I don't read). Sorry I bought it.
2,Disappointment,"I bought this version and really was excited to receive my copy. I was disappointed to discover upon receiving it that it not really the Septuagint! There are books and chapters missing from this Bible version that should be in it if it were truly the Septuagint. There should be to books of Esdras and the first book should contain the first chapter which explains about what happened to the ark and why! So if you are in search of the real Septuagint Bible, do not purchase this version. If you just want a version that calls itself the Septuagint and is not, I will sell you my copy at a reduced price."
3,Review of Brenton's Greek-English Septuagint,"This is a great idea, but the formatting of the dual-language edition made referencing back-and-forth rather difficult. The problem here is an accumulation of little issues: (a) the headings on the pages list the book with Roman numerals, (b) the on page markings have their own separate margin for Greek, and yet are integrated within the text for English, (c) the King James translation is used, (c) no introductions are provided and few footnotes, and (d) the two languages are given different column sizes. Again, this is fundamentally a great idea, but Brenton's edition suffers from awkward or outdated presentation. If one needs a dual-language Septuagint, this is the only place to go, but its a shame this hasn't been updated."
2,Greek Septuagint with Apocrypha,"This rendering of the Septuagint is most enjoyable for study and research. The verses could be numbered better. Having the Apocryphal books listed as canon is quite inappropriate, since the Apocryphal writings have proved against inspiredness. I criticize the fact that the divine name of God is taken out of both the Greek texts and the corresponding English column, and simply replaced with ""the Lord"", or ""God"". Brenton, as a translator, should have acknowledged the seriousness of producing a Bible translation, translating Hebrew into Greek with utmost dignity and respect for the One from whom the original scriptures was inspired: Jehovah (whose name appears in the original Hebrew texts over 7,000 times). Displaying a religiously biased style, it is evident that Brenton had no intention of making the true thoughts and ideas that the scriptures were meant to convey available for the reader. Thank you."
2,"I need ""mingshey's"" e-mail address.","I will not use this page, which is designed for book reviews, to argue, 'mingshey'. Provide me with your e-mail address and we'll talk seriously."
5,For an Eastern Orthodox,"The Septuagint is the official OT version. We belive this version was made under the guidance of the Holy Spirity. Take a look, for example, in the Timothy Ware's The Orthodox Church, new edition in page 200. Despite this version and translation are freely avaliable on internet, having it in print is much better. Brenton his the only one translation of the entire Septuagint in english, (Charles Thompson version does not have the ""Apocrypha""). Don't worry about the YHWH name, it is ok to use Lord instead."
5,It is a valuable resource to scholars.,An excellent reference for biblical and patristical scholars. This work will prove to be a useful source for reveiwing new testament parallels.
4,"Good Book, only one disappointment","Good book, exactly what I was looking for, only it does NOT look like the picture, it's more of a tan and brown binding. Was a little upset about that but otherwise satisfied."
3,good introduction to concepts,"It's an easy to read, well-organized book. The book can provide an introduction to what you need to know about segmentations, but not a lot more than that. Good start but definitely not enough to make you either highly competent at consuming segmentation research, let alone actually performing it."
2,Breadth not Depth,"If you are looking for a high level overview on market segementation, then your quest can stop here. However, if you are interested in obtaining more than a cursory understanding of the topic, this is a book to pass on. Examples are so obvious that they do not offer much insight, and the lack of useful and impactful tools is problematic. Another issue is that this book predates the Internet, so inherently the inforation is not leading edge. Finally, the writing style leaves much to be desired; at times it is too cute and at others, it is totally obtuse."
5,A Gift from a Master Composer,"This book, by the great composer Charles Wuorinen, provides the clearest instruction in the basics of 12 tone compositional practice imaginable. The approach here is clearly and simply on how to create, extend and use 12 tone compositional materials, pitch and rhythmic,to generate surface detail and formal design. Any student of contemporary musical practice, whether composer or simply interested musician, will be delighted by this wonderful text, and also by the composers own examples, which illuminate each lesson, every step of the way.Simple Composition is simply a great book by a master composer!"
4,Pretty Good,This is a good introduction and some in depth compositional instruction into contemporary serial composition techniques and practice. The book is well written and examples clear and provides a reasonable depth of detail.
1,Backward-looking,"I leave it to you to judge how seriously to take this book from a quote within it:""While the tonal system, in an atrophied or vestigial form, is still used today in popular and commercial music, and even occasionally in the works of backward-looking serious composers, it is no longer employed by serious composers of the mainstream. It has been replaced or succeeded by the 12-tone system."""
2,Composition without direction.,"This is one of those books that fools you with the title. A book purporting to teach should start with the students prior knowledge other wise its ineffective or worse, confusing. Perhaps the title should be Composition without direction. Frankly the twelve tone examples hurt the authors intent very much, making this book barely useful for anyone wanting to write anything other than twelve tone music. As with so many other composition books, we're given the authors favorite musical examples, not ones familiar to students (at least not to me). We're given techniqes but not told when and where to use them. Maybe it was more appropriate to an earlier reader but even thats doubtful. Its hardly accessible anymore. I can't recommend this book to anyone except the twelve tonalists."
2,Workmanlike,"The premise of this book had possibilities--young women inherits derelict pub in an Essex village and transforms it into a highly popular gourmet restaurant. Her livelihood and her life are threatened after two patrons are poisoned by lethal mushrooms slipped into their food.As I say, the plot kept me involved as did the tough-minded heroine, but ultimately the book dragged by focussing on a twenty-year old crime. Also, I did not buy the ease with which the heroine fell for and submitted to the two men who showed a romantic interest.If you need something quick and undemanding for a plane ride, this would be an OK choice but I wouldn't really seek it out. (I got my copy on the FREE BOOKS shelf of our local library)."
4,Keeping it REAL,"DJ Irene continues to mix the dope sh@%. Live in IBIZA is a little more mellow than the first Global House Diva. Has some of the same hard beats but for the most part new and there's probably more songs you recognize on this one. Irene has true energy and dedication it definately shows in this album.p.s. Don't forget to check out the CD Rom on this CD, guaranteed to be an unforgetable party favor on your next roll."
5,The ONLY Reel you should buy.,"% stars should only go to a truly perfect product. This is a five star item.Plastic is half of the cost and will break in due time. This reel is a truly superior product. It's strong, works flawlessly.It's been said before and it is very true with this product: Buy Once.This will last you a lifetime. It couldn't have been a better use of my money."
3,"Sturdy, Reliable, Industrial","It is sturdy and reliable. Handles 100 feet of good garden hose with ease. A bit industrial seeming, but a real winner if you don't want a broken plastic real after one season. I'd buy it again. (But haven't had to because it's held up so well.)"
5,Review of the Rapid Reel Parallel Wall Hose Reel,"This product is quality built and the components are top-rate! The reel and the hose connections are all-metal construction that will last for years. Plus, the reel is backed by a 10 year manufacturer's warranty. The unit was especially easy to assemble and install. Dispensing the hose and rewinding it is effortless and smooth and I really like the built-in reel brake that prevents the reel from rolling free and dispensing more hose than needed. The product is value priced and a bargain compared to the cost of plastic hose reel products with which it competes."
5,Quality product,I ordered one and was pleased with quality. I've since ordered two more with plans to order 2 more. I recommend this product to anyone tired of dealing with cheap leaky plastic hose reels.
5,Rapid Reel Rocks!,"Why would anyone have one of those cheap plastic hose reels when they could have this? I put it together myself, in about 15 minutes, with no difficulty. This is quite sturdy, holds the hose neatly and since it is mounted to the wall - no tipping over when I pull some hose off of it! Our small yard looks so tidy now that the hose isn't lying in a jumble on the ground. I definitely recommend this!"
5,"Is this for ""reel?""","I purchased a Rapid Reel one year ago and made a second purchase a week ago. What's there not to like? An American company, sturdy construction, and if you need servicing, just call the toll free number to speak to a live representative located in Nebraska who can be understood! No call being routed to the other side of the world! I called for a replacement part (due to my own negligence) and they promptly fed-ex the part with no additional charge. Is this for `reel?'"
5,My Rapid Reel,"I have no complaints about my purchase. I have a parallel mount on decorative concrete block with 150 ft of hose. My wife can unwind and wind it with little effort. The only trouble I had during the assembly was drilling and mounting the bracket to the concrete blocks. The 4 holes I drilled did not all line up. I tried to drill a bigger hole in the bracket and snapped a corner of it off. I called the company and they sent another bracket over night free of charge. I will never buy a cheap plastic reel again, this one is the way to go."
5,THE ULTIMATE HOSE REEL,"I would never consider ever purchasing another type of hose reel. It is everything that it promises and possibly more. It's construction and ease of use and installation is above reproach. The intial cost may seem more than your average hose reel, but, without a doubt it is worth it. It should last 2to3 times longer than your average reel."
5,Great Hose Reel,We have had several types of hose reels and by far this is the most sturdy of them all. This is our 2nd one and we love it!
4,Worth the money,"I bought the cheaper version and it broke. This works great. It is well made and looks like it will last a very long time. Spend the money on this now and avoid being disappointed by cheeper versions which cost less. I doubt it will really handle 150 ft of 5/8 hose. I have 100 feet and it works fine, but I imagine 150ft would need to be rolled very very carefully to fit."
3,"Proofs: Simple, but not rigorous","Background: Electrical engineering grad student. Lots of math. Prior linear algebra course.Reason to read book: Wanted a text to review proofs of many of the important theorems that are used in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Stuff like why Hermitian matrices provide orthogonal eigenvectors and real eigenvalues. Also, wanted a review of vector spaces, basis sets, etc. That means pretty much most of the book.How much of the book I've studied: Most of the proofs in the entire book. Some of the worked problems. None of the exercises.Analysis: The book provides a comprehensive list of the useful proofs. However, the proofs are simple but not rigorous. They give you good insight on why the theorems are what they are, but they don't remove all doubt as to their validity."
2,Look for another book,"Leon makes a commendable effort to make this book readable with color figures and applied examples of his topics. Unfortunately his familiarity with the topic has caused him to make the common mistake of leaving out mathematical steps and explanations under the assumption that they are trivial and obvious. Additionally he often brings up a topic or theorem and leaves the proof as an exercise for the reader. Exercises for the reader are not supposed to be discussions in the text, they are called Exercises and are listed in the back of the section as homework.In summary it was a good effort, but he falls in the common trap of mathematical books that has the author write at their own level of comprehension."
3,Not bad...,"A pretty good textbook, but by no means outstanding. I learned a lot by working the problems. I did not, however, learn how to do more than simple proofs. Instead of outlining some methods as to how beginning students should go about learning how to prove theorems, the author assumes you already know how to do that. Consequently, I didn't master that skill. It also would have helped if the Solutions Manual that accompanies this text were available to students; maybe by now they've made it available. Leon definitely does not include enough worked examples in the text, and those problems where ""The Proof is left as an exercise for the reader"" are useless and defeating. I wholeheartedly disagree with the review above that ""if you can't handle this text, don't major in math, you don't have what it takes"". Nonsense. Provided you give it your all, you can major in math, and understand Leon's text, even if you aren't blessed with sheer, infallible intellect."
4,Interesting Psychic,"Sherry Healy, is the author of this book, although she uses the name Shealy. Her style of instruction-type chapters help make the psychic adventure an easy one.Those interested in knowing more about the methods of a psychic will find this an interesting read. The perspective of the book is from the point of view of the psychic author. Sherry seems to know much of psychic work. Sharing personal experiences allows the reader to get a closer look at the inner vissions of a psychic. Spirit guides, soul mate and dreams are a main topic followed by a section of simple divination."
4,Dunning scores again!,"I have followed Dunning's writing from nearly the beginning (used to live close to his bookstore). Once again he has told a great story with convincing authority and white-knuckle suspense. One of the things I like best about Dunning is his dialog which reflects reality. I only gave this novel 4 stars because it is less literary than his earlier works and seems to fall into the more popular armchair mystery category. Nonetheless, it is a heckuva good read. --Ron Kienzle, Cincinnati."
3,Bloodstock & Books,"Somehow this Cliff Janeway title does not quite make the scene of either the horse-world or book-world. An accidentally pass-up of a John D. McDonald, which is gone when Cliff returns is the substance of the bibliophile theme readers have loved in Dunning's tales.The plot staggers alone with dominate father, disappointing son's, murder and greed, but never quite comes together. Is Dunning trying to wrap up an intriguing series?Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and TRAVELERS."
2,Disappointing fifth title....,"I WAS so enthralled with Cliff Janeway's character, his love of books and all that good, good knowledge...that this fifth endeavor of Mr. Dunning's just left me dazed with disappointment.It doesn't matter that I never knew anything about horses and the racetrack (I found that a very interesting aspect) but this entire novel left a lot to be desired on so many levels. I, too, was glad not to have spent any money on this having borrowed it from the library.I can only hope that the next Janeway novel is a vast improvement on all levels over this one. PLEASE! Susan"
2,Big disappointment,"Wow -- what a huge disappointment. John Dunning is such a great story teller. I have all his books on my shelf, but this was a huge dud. I was really looking forward to reading it -- but it was so incredibly boring that I had to put it down. I just couldn't trudge through it. It felt REALLY contrived. Very sad. :("
3,Not That Bad,"Reading over the reviews here I see that many people are disappointed in this book. I'm surprised because I liked it better than some of his other books and I'm kind of glad he got rid of that girlfriend. Her character just didn't work for me. I won't be surprised if his next girlfriend is from Idaho.I know nothing about horse racing so reading about some of what goes on in the stable area was new and interesting to me.And I think the person who said that the author didn't play fair in giving clues as to who the killer was soon enough is wrong. I thought there were plenty of good clues. I figured it out long before I usually do.All-in-all I liked it. I liked the characters, the settings, and the ending. No, it doesn't deserve 4 or 5 stars, but it is a nice read."
5,"Bravo, John Dunning!","This Cliff Janeway book mystery will rank as one of the better in the series as Dunning mixes his insider knowledge of horseracing with a mystery that may or may not include a 20-year-old murder but definitely includes a collection of juveniles (children's books) of unimaginable value. Cliff is called in to locate a collection of books that went missing from the collection, and he finds himself backstage at the racetrack. This is a well-crafted novel with a kicker resolution and plenty of motives, as many people are protecting secrets of one kind or another. Altogether a satisfying read, as much for the peek into a book collection that just about any book lover would die for."
3,My least favorite Cliff Janeway book,I have really enjoyed all of the previous Janeway novels but this one just wasn't as good. I'm not much of a horse person either so the setting didn't promote my interest. I also felt like he backed himself in the corner with who the killer was... jeez I guess all of the logical suspects have been eliminated so lets just bring in a new guy.In any case I do think John Dunning writes well - this just isn't his best work.
2,"Too much detail, not enough plot","Dunning should have ended the series at book #4. There is way too much happening in this book and ""having a score card"" is the most apt phrase describing the work. Dunning is a talented writer and I'm sure he has a lot of mysteries still in him waiting to be written. Hope it happens soon."
2,Struggling to Improve,"At this stage Janeway is still on his big he-man trip, though less obnoxious than the last episode. He's still the kind of guy who would -- and does -- call a truck a ""big bastard"" and inform us, whether we're interested or not, that the sight of a rare book makes his least elegant private parts tingle. I never mind R-rated language, so I took a look at why his is so objectionable. I think it's because it's always inappropriate to any situation, and put forth as a form of showing off. And there are other off-puts. When he, a years-long, top homicide cop, jammed his pen down the barrel of a recently fired gun to protect the evidence, all I could do was sigh. I sighed a lot through this one. The best parts are his you-are-there renderings of interesting things like rare book markets and, in this case, horse racing. Worth having bought, but just barely."
4,One Scene Alone Makes It All Worthwhile,"There's a scene in ""The Bookwoman's Last Fling"" that I have never seen done as well anywhere. It's the scene where Cliff Janeway wakes up the trunk, just after having been discovered snooping around a remote house just a little bit too long for his own good. This scene alone makes the book worthwhile. It's a great picture into the world of a smart detective. It's a very vivid and funny picture of a brain coming back to life, of a mind sorting out real from unreal. And it's action packed even though, really, Cliff is not moving. It's a brilliant set piece all by itself. I enjoyed the trip into the horse-racing circuit though some of the conversations lagged (just a touch). This felt like Dick Francis meets John Dunning and the ending, as always, was niftily plotted and revealed. Dunning is a satisfying writer - the scenes carry weight, gravity and emotional heft."
1,worst one yet,"as a book dealer i've enjoyed reading the cliff janeway books, despite the poor writing, because they dealt with my world. in this book there's nothing but the poor writing with a silly plot, cardboard characters,and a tiresome narrator. gk"
2,A Sad Surprise,"I've read several of the cliff Janeway novels and thoroughly enjoyed them. They not only held my interest all the way through...I became involved in the plot and with cliff Janeway on his journey's. The unraveling of his mysteries regarding rare book collections had depth and the information given by this talented author added to the suspense.Unfortunately, all of the marvelous situations I named for Dunning's other works in this series were sadly lacking in this particular entry. It quite simply didn't hold my interest. I was unable to get involved with Janeway as I had in the previous books. It was a sad surprise for me as I was already to get into another great adventure with cliff Janeway.So all I can say to this gifted author is...nice try but no cigar.BTW...I did listen to this book on CD read/narrated by George Guidall. Even G.G.'s excellent performance could not save this book."
5,El mejor volumen de la colección,"Poesía, narrativa y ensayo: este volumen lo tiene todo desde 1952 hasta 1972: ""Otras inquisiciones"", ""El hacedor"", ""El otro, el mismo"", ""Para las seis cuerdas"", ""Elogio de la sombra"", ""El informe Brodie"" y ""El otro de los tigres"". Si sólo pudiera comprar uno de los cuatro tomos; escogería este."
1,Doesn't work like I thought it would.,"I got this to be something I could put under my desk and use while I was working, to burn some extra calories....lo and behold, when I tried to use it in that manner, my knees would hit the desk, rendering the device useless.I would have returned it, if my roommate hadn't already thrown away the box. Now I have minimal use for it, when sitting on the ground and reading, by setting the cycle in front of me and pedaling with my hands."
4,Iceland's Answer To Britney,"Not a bad debut single from Iceland's Svala. Working with several Swedish songwriters, she comes up with an appealing midtempo pop tune. She doesn't possess the most amazing voice on this recording, but she can hold her own. Also on this single is a brief description of her upcoming album, along with snippets of two album tracks, ""Close To You"" and ""Love Me, Love Me Not"", both which show much promise when paired with this above average tune."
3,The Final Verdict,"This is Svala's first single, well what do I think about it? Lets just poot it this way, if I was a little 12 year old girl who adored Britney Spears and such pop queens, then in that case I would appreciate and like the new single from Svala. I personally dont recognize this pop style as being real pop and real music in general, i recongnize it as being pop for little girsl of the maximum age og maybe 14.So if you ar looking for real artisitic pop then in that case this should be your choice because infact what this single is, is nothing more to me then just an average Britney Spears clone. What also bothers me about this sort of Pop is that the messages never seem to change, every single song is always about a girl who whants some dude really badly, and it is very clear that this is xectly what little 13 years old girls think about.So the final verdict is that this album is nothing more thatn a moderately poor Britney Spears imitation. Buy it if you are 10 - 14 years of age."
1,The Cover Art says It All,"Sure, 20 great Aussie songs, but they are not remastered. Grab ""Brilliant From Birth"" which has been remastered and contains copius liner notes. It's a much better bargain and the cover of it, well, at least it's not a toothy cartoon!"
5,Must Have Book,"As a Marine NCO, this book is a must have. Learning the history of the Marine NCO and talking about different styles of leadership are just small portions of this book. For new NCO's this is highly recommended. I buy this book and write a personalized message in the front for every Marine I have joining our sacred NCO ranks!!!"
2,The Marine Corp Staff NCO,Really doesn't say much or give solid direction for a Marine Corp Staff NCO. Explains more the structure of the Marine Corp. Explains very little the requirements and duties of a Staff NCO in the United States Marine Corp.
2,"Shoulder pieces are really wide, bad fit for young kids","I ordered this x-small and it was big for my 50lb, 4' tall 6 year old. I thought it was too big in size so I ordered an XX-Small too and they both just have really wide/long shoulder pieces. The chest fit good in the smaller size but there were boys on the team with small shoulder pieces on their shoulder pads and they had a much better range of movement. Find another brand with smaller shoulder pieces if you have a small pigskin player like my son."
5,Perfect,"Was the perfect Christmas present for my son. He loves them, and it is true to size. Great quality, and great price!"
2,What's Up Here???,"I purchased this album about a year ago, and it is indeed released by ""Master Song"" of Aus., and it is the album pictured here. BUT, it only includes 10 songs....NOT 20!!!!! This CD actually has the first 10 songs listed under the Amazon ad......if it had the full 20 that are listed, then it would be worth the asking price. The recordings are actually quite good, but I suggest you contact the seller before purchasing this album to ensure it has the full 20 songs that are advertised!"
2,Dance targeted for teens,"Not being a part of the apparently targeted fourteen year old girl demographic, we'll just trust ublmusic's claim that these hits ""summarize the top beat-driven anthems in the country."" DJ Geoffe mixes equal parts high-energy pop beats, lots (and lots) of vocoder voices and enough sugary charm to occasionally beguile; French Affair's ""My Heart Goes Boom"" mixes nursery melodies, French, and smiley-bounce thumping to be a top-40 radio night cut.Which essentially is what Dance Essentials Volume 1 plays like; your local teen-radio Saturday Night Mix. There's even some trance-for-beginner cuts here as well (the Thrillseekers ""Synaesthesia"" and Ian Van Dahl's ""Castles in the Sky""). ATB actually closes out the set with the most developed song of the lot, a darker, pulsating number to springboard listeners into what more advanced dance music sounds like.Aimed strictly for the roller-skating party crowd. If that's who you're buying this for, then here's a candy bar."
1,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"Thinking that I was ordering the 1938 film classic, boy was I shocked and disappointed when I found a rip-off cartoon DVD with the same title in my mail. Amazon, shame on you for not giving out this info to the prospective buyer. Please make it known to customers that what you are selling is not the movie we are being led to believe is available. Film collectors Lawrence and Julia McNally, Yuma,Az."
1,MISLEADING TITLE,BUYER BEWARE!!THIS DVD IS NOT THE ORIGINAL 1938 FILM. IT IS A CARTOON RELEASED IN 2005.
5,Great CD,"If you like all types of music, you will love this CD. I enjoy each and every song on this recording. How many other CDs can I say the same about? None."
4,Bringing bluegrass to the masses,"Bluegrass traditionalist turn away (or at least go back to the hollow, repair your still, put your worn sandals on, and pick with your cousins!). This is an attempt to bring bluegrass and a legend to the people of a different era. And it works. Yes, there are some duds, but they are far and few between. Elton John's 'Country Comfort' is a great song in any genre interpretation and it works here with the addition of background pickin, 'Borrowed Love' will be loved by Yoakam fans who already like his voice (I don't, yet it is an ok song),""Ring of Fire' is different, but not bad, 'Fill her up' is a nice song by Sting, 'Foggy Mt. Breakdown' is great pickin, and 'Passin Thru' with Don Henley is good stuff. Dare to explore and you will expand your musical horizons. Good pickin is good pickin whether it is a guitar or a banjo. This is good pickin......"
4,earl scruggs and friends.,"the cd was delivered very quickly and i am very pleased with it, great music!!"
2,Earl Scruggs And Friends,I was disapointed in this CD; I am a bluegrass traditionalist and this does not hit the mark with me!
1,DON'T MIX!,"I love bluegrass music very much, but I'm sorry Elton John and Bluegrass music don't mix. You don't hear Earl Scruggs do any Elton John."
5,Could not ask for a better CD,We are completely happy with our purchase. No skipping; just perfect and timewise was also very good. Thanks
3,ok;,"as to the book itself, it's ok. not nearly as interesting as stephenson's other work. i loved snow crash, diamond age, cryptonomicon, anathem and reamde so i'm patiently slogging along hoping the baroque cycle will get better as i get further along. so far, it's slow going.as to the repackaging controversy, i am one of the indignant group. i wouldn't mind at all if the publisher was clear. but naming both volume one of the 3-part series AND volume one of the 8-part series ""quicksilver"" is very misleading. even to amazon itself. amazon says ""would you like to see this book on kindle? click here to ask the publisher."" well, king of the vagabonds is already on kindle as part of the long quicksilver. i both called and wrote audible.com to try and figure out why my audible versions were ending in the middle of my kindle version, and the reps had absolutely no clue.thanks to all the amazon reviewers for solving the mystery."
1,Don't buy it,"I have to agree that extracting a part of a previous book and marketing it in this confusing way seems to be a rip off. Especially as I bought the initial book here at Amazon. Getting a e-mail about a ""new"" book sucked me right in."
3,Nice watch but too heavy,"The watch was nice but way too heavy for me. It was hard to tell from the picture how wide the band was. Very heavy for a woman. No problem with the seller, but the 10% restocking fee caught me by surprise."
5,Great book and service,This book is a great read for all interested in health and well being........I was quite worried that it would not be sent correctly since I live in Mexico but the book arrived fast and in fine condition......Amazon lhas got me back as a satisfied customer. K. Dörsch
2,Really more about mushrooms,"This book deals more with mushrooms and plants-as-medicine than actual sugar molecules. I find it rather absurd that plant products are discussed as glyconutrients. Any plant-based material has a good chance of being made from carbohydrates. Does that make it a glyconutrient? NO! Just because plant and fungal extracts contain chains of six carbon sugars doesn't make those extracts glyconutrients any more than plywood is a glyconutrient.I'm still looking for a good book about ingesting essential sugars in their most basic form and the results that one might expect.Bottom line: If you want a book that says ""here, eat this mushroom"" then buy it, otherwise pass on it."
3,There is better books on the subject.,Was disappointed in the composition. I fell there is two much better books on glyconutrients.
1,Back to Witch Doctors and Snake Oil Salesman,"In all my born days, I have never witnessed a cure for any of the ailments mentioned in this book. Sugars...? Come on people, wake up. We all have heard it before. One pill, one cure, one witch doctor getting rich. And don't forget his friends who own the manufacturing rights for the sugar pills.I choose not."
2,Generally disappointed,"There is too much anacdotal info. Lots of info that was unrelated to glyconutrients -- just general health hype. Probably 40-50% of the book is useless information that doesn't help the reader understand glyconutrients any better.There was major lack of clear principles on how gloconutrients work and why.Hoped for something of the caliber of ""Fats That Heal, Fats That Kill"" by Udo Erasmus.The desciptions of the 8 essential sugars was extremely terse. This was what I most wanted to know. There was extremely poor information on food sources of these nutrients. I had expected sources for each and the quantities found in each source. The amount needed for basic, optimal, and theraputec doses is lacking.I am quite interested in this topic. I've ordered 2 more book on the subject hoping they are more useful."
2,"Message too ""clinical""","As a layman, seeking information for my personal use, I found the text difficult to understand, due to the technical language. Probably ideal for the professional."
3,Sugars that heal,"Excellent book and very easy to read and understand.especially as I was reasonably new to Glyco nutrients,one of the best features,on Amazon.com You could see the contents before buying.What I liked about the book.It told you where you could get your nutrients in the plant worldalso what to look for when buying some of the sugarswhat each of the sugars do in your body.It was good enough that a visitor browsing through it took it home and I have had to order another book."
3,Where's the full length version...?,"It is really irritating when you see a show on PBS and then order the show from either PBS or Amazon or whomever, and not get the same version. The version of this film shown on PBS before this was released commercially was longer. Other than that particular beef (which is a significant one) the content on Don is informative and well done. What he REALLY needs to release is the elusive and mega-rare film from the 70's called ""Till Tommorow."" Snippets of this show, which was only officially released in the Beta format, are seen in this film, and in Don's ""Starry Starry Night"" DVD in the ""extras"" menu. Now THAT would be a treat to see Don in those heady, early days when he wasn't so much of the crooner he has turned into. In the 70's, his singing was passionate and strident. I miss those days..!! The film is worth buying and certainly gives insight into his storied careed...even if it is a truncated version."
3,Mostly recent interviews and comments.,"If you are a big fan, as I am, well worth viewing. Would have liked more of his music, less commentary."
5,A Fitting Tribute,"I'd been a fan of Don McLean since his career began in the late 60's. However in more recent years I'd lost faith. He seemed to be going through the motions in concerts and seemed somewhat bitter and twisted. This documentary restored my faith in the man and explained the evolution of his career and how he currently feels about life in general and the music business as it now stands. Far from being bitter and twisted, he is, in fact, that rare thing, 'A Happy Man'. He's produced a fine body of work and openly admits to not feeling as driven as he once did. He seems to have become a person who has figured out what's important in life - and it isn't fame and fortune [although those things are nice to have]. Some great early clips and a selection throughout his career are worth the price alone."
3,cd version is decent,cd version is ok.I went to HDTracks.com and downloaded rearview mirror in a Highend version.WOW what a difference from the cd or dvd
5,HOLY COW ... the suspense is OVERWHELMING!,"(Because others before me have summarized it, I will not.) This is another MOFINA thriller that caught me from the very first page! Altho SCARY, SCARY, SCARY in all the right places... it was one that I could not put down! A multiple-layered plot that takes many twists from the first to the last page! This was an addictive page turner for me. I wholeheartedly give this a SIX on the 5-star scale. I've read all of MOFINA's books and altho I always think the next one can not be better than the last...I have to say, this one is my favorite of them all."
4,Lotus Guide Magazine Review,"DNA of Healing: A Five-Step Process for Total Wellness and Abundance(ISBN 1-57174-469-X) Hampton Roads By Margaret RubyAccording to Margaret Ruby's new book, your physical DNA is only half the story. The other half is the emotional DNA handed down through many generations. Your ancestors' emotions, thoughts, and beliefs affect every aspect of your life today--your health, relationships, career, finances, and more. DNA of Healing reveals the breakthrough five-step process that has helped people worldwide neutralize the negative emotional patterns and beliefs they have inherited through their ancestral lineage and reset their genetic codes for total well-being. Visit www.possibilitiesdna.com.Rahasya Poe, Lotus GuideTo Believe Or Not To Believe: The Social and Neurological Consequences of Belief Systems"
2,It's Not About DNA. The Title is Misleading.,"The book is not at all about ""DNA"" or ""Vibrational/Energetic Medicine"". It's just a mundane how-to book without anything new or revolutionary in both insights and technigues. I'm very disappointed with the book because the title is misleading.Over promise, under deliver."
3,Good book but the techniques are complicated.,"I appreciated the authors scientific examples of how DNA is changeable, and for all the science it is also written with plenty of insight and warmth.I think the author presents a tremendous healing protocol as well as excellent techniques for manifesting the life you want to live. I didn't give it a high rating however, because the techniques are pretty time consuming and complicated to learn and implement (you have to inventory your whole life with Jungian psychological techniques for example) and there are much more simple systems for accomplishing the same things. I would recommend the book Path of Empowerment by Barbara Marciniak which is along the same lines but way simplified and also The Law of Attraction by Hicks.If a person had plenty of spare time on their hands to work with the material in the book I would then highly recommend it, but I can't think of a single person I know who would actually have the time and energy to put the info. to use."
5,Amazing!,"This book will transform you life. This book shows you how to create your life to be filled with joy, love and abundance. I love the 5 steps."
4,Talks about free trade agreements,"Many issues in this 1971 book are still with us. It was written in response to what the authors considered as rising protectionism in Europe and the United States. But more broadly, they study how developing countries can grow their per capita income by successful trading.Much space is devoted to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the predecessor to the WTO. The authors show how tariff barriers can be a negative sum game. They strongly advocate free trade agreements. You can find extensive mention of NAFTA. Which seems like an ananchronism. Since NAFTA was only approved in 1994, 23 years after this book. But that deley is eloquent testimony to the persistent power of protectionism."
2,Nice but not lost some luster........,"I must say that I was really anticipating something a little more than what I heard. Being from Chicago and deep into the house scene, some of the beats just didn't do it for me. I'm more a beats guy than lyrics and if the beat is not hitting then nothing else matters. Q-Tip is a hell of a lyricist and yes I've always purchase what he's put out even with A Tribe Called Quest, but I forced myself into trying to listen to the entire album. ""Blue Girl"" and ""Even If It Is So"" has a nice beat that you can throw on a party and just sit back and bounce your head to. The beats are nice and relaxing and something I can just chill with. Yes everyone has there own opinion about what they like but for me it wasn't what I was expecting."
1,What happened?,Q-Tip's albums have been a huge disappointment since he went solo. This is just another one of those albums that is a huge letdown when comparing it to the old Tribe Called Quest albums. Time for Q-Tip to retire and stop putting out wack albums like this and The Renaissance.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"I do like jazz BUT from jazz artist. Q-tip has that unique voice and it has been awhile since Q-tip has put something out there and I was really looking forward to that Q-tip style, don't get me wrong I do like Q-tip because he is a deep lyrist and I wanted the Q-tip vibe!!!!"
2,Not Very Fun,"I bought the game super cheap and I'm glad I didn't spend much. We played the game in a group of 3 couples who have had several cocktails. Now, usually 6 people drinking cocktails just makes every game better but in this case, it was just kinda dumb. I initially liked that we had little headbands to add to the fun but in essence you are just betting on dumb video clips with an asian voiced guy who isn't that funny but tries to be. I would pass on this game."
3,"Silly and OK Fun, But Much Better Group Games Available","I do not really like the betting style, and if we play again-- we will likely change it because if someone is not good with chopsticks they just become frustrated about always losing their sushi. The videos were funny, but we were in 'happy spirits'. I am not sure it would have lasted as long with a sober crowd.We like DVD games, betting games, groups games.. so others that trump this for us is 'Trivial Pursuit Bet You Know It', 'Scene It Squabble', 'Cranium', 'Taboo' (if they made new cards?!#?@!#), and favorite.. 'Apples to Apples'."
1,The irony of it all.,"I would like to buy what appears an excellent product at an excellent price but I cannot because this supplier will ship only to the domestic destinations. This means that people in U.S Territories, (Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several others regions)who are U.S citizens and serviced by the USPS, are precluded from purchasing these harmonicas because Amazon has chosen to consider them (I am a U. S. citizen)""international"" i.e. not elegible to buy items reserved for ""domestic"" because they will not be shipped to these ""foreign"" destinations. This ugly distinction smacks of economic apartheid. It is truly ironic that a supplier from Hong Kong is able to prevent a bona fide purchase from a U.S. Territory with the help of the unjust policies of a U.S. company. Good luck with that one."
5,Great Planning Resource,"I'm a public official with the planning function, looking for a better way to preserve farm land, open space and rural character. This book offers a lot of insight into the history and uses of conservation easements. The book is divided into sections that describe in detail how laws and courts in each section of the country administer conservation easements. I recommend this book - it is an excellent planning resource!"
2,selectic New Testament usage of psalms,"The items covered by the book are covered well. However, the deep questions a non-selective reader of the pslams will uncover curious and difficult theological issues beyond this book. For example, what of the psalms which speak of our Lord as mighty among the gods? How do we deal with psalms that cry out for bashing children's heads against rocks. What about the abundance of curses? A truly theological introduction to the book of Psalms would address the issues the psalms present."
4,This high-quality coffee table book has not just great pics but contains a real slice of Americana,"With over 500 photos, Author Russ Banham andforeward(er) [the late Hungarian-AmericanActor] Pual Newman, take the reader intofour different sections about the life of anAmerican inventor-genius. They don't go intoFord's somewhat kooky views (was he a Masonor just into the Occult?!, but stick strictlyto his wanting to make a car for the Americanfamily and our love affair with it! Why, ohwhy can't we have Corporations like this today?"
3,Amazing photos and some good reading but a lot of fluff too,"The book is worth it just for the photography. Content is sufficient though some of the reading is biased toward Ford (their hand is in the book) and the section covering important models shows cars that Ford had absolutely nothing to do with (Jaguar E Type, early Aston Martin, pre-Ford ownership Mazda three wheeler and Miata among others). These just don't belong there. In the end, a nice book to have but not a complete history of the car company or the man."
4,Excellent up-to-date information. Surprising!,"This book was bought on a whim by a canary keeper of many years. It completely rethinks the canary as a pet, revolutionizes care, e.g. your canary will now be flying around your home and is insightful in all sorts of ways. Alas many of the suggested products are no longer readily available in the US where the canary has been falling out of popularity, first to the budgie and now the larger parrots. A strong and enthusiastic recommendation."
3,"Review from a radio adaptation of ""River of Fire""","Two girls, Melindy and Jasmine, befriend each other after Jasmine rescues Melindy from a riverboat explosion and fire. Jasmine is a runaway slave and Melindy is trying to get back to her family in Mobile. The girls experience all the dangers and thrills of living off the land and avoiding those who would return Jasmine to her owners. As they help each other to survive they learn to trust each other and God and become the best of friends. The reader will gain an appreciation for the quality of life of a young girl in the early 1800's from the viewpoint of being slave and free. I only heard the radio adaptation and would like to get a copy of this out of print classic."
5,"So beautiful, and easy too!",Susan's books are wonderful for the beginner as well as the experienced crocheter. The directions are clear and easy to understand. Her designs are beautiful and include a full color photo for each pattern. These books are a must-have for any crocheter!
1,Crocheted Christmas Ornament Covers,"Please see review on Crocheted Christmas Ornament Covers 2...assuming it is published. I would, however, look into some of the beaded covers."
5,best melvins album since the last best melvins album,"I can only second, third, fourth and fifth what other people have been saying... this is a great album. Extremely distinct from all the Melvins' other albums and yet still quintessentially Melvins. A May Zing.And SO HEAVY."
5,quite good!,"brings me back to the days of ""stoner witch""! some of their most accessable stuff in years!"
2,Such is sludge,"2 1/2While I wouldn't go so far as to say this disc kept me interested, at least it does show the pummeling power chord purveyors still somewhat relevant after twenty years in a genre bled dry."
5,Jeez,"This album will sure as hell take you for a ride. It's loud, kickass, and extremely creative. The drum work is gut-crunchingly heavenlike, the riffs will almost force your head to bob, and the vocals are so god damn heavy it's like satan and his minions scratching upwards from under the floor.If you like those sort of things, this album will not disappoint."
4,great place for Melvins beginners,"I'm a big Melvins fans but they have a lot of stuff I'm not that into. I think they're a great metal band but a pretty bland experimental band. This record has great songs and is very consistent. If you're new to the band this is the place to start, then check out Stoner Witch, Houdini, etc.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City while yer at it."
4,mirror image,"I thought this was a good book as you are not sure which sisters&#65533; side to take when it all turns ugly. Although there are twists and turns in the tail they are quite easy to follow so you&#65533;re not left thinking, what was that all about? My one fault if I had to find one with this book would be that they reveal the bad guy to quickly they could of maybe left you guessing a little longer. But overall I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone not only charmed fans."
2,ugh..,"I thought that this book was okay but it could have been better.. I didnt like how it told the victims point of view and also Darryl's. I love the guy but i didnt really care about how his board meetings were going. The book bored me pretty badly and it made me want to go and do something eles. Usually I can read a Charmed book in about a day or less but it took me about 3 days to read this one. I dont suggest it but if you collect the series, buy it as cheap as you can so you dont waste your money."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this trimmer head to replace the the original that came with my weed eater curved head trimmer, and boy and I glad that I bought this.Once the factory loaded spool ran out on my original trimmer head I kept having problems with the replacement spool that I put in. The old head would not spool the trimmer string out correctly and I had to stop and pull out the thread. No such problems with the Grass Gator.The Grass Gator packaging came with multiple screw-bolt combos and I had to match to my trimmer. Also, because the Grass Gator has a dual cutting threads it improved the efficiency of my trimmer. Reloading new thread into the head was very straight forward. I use a .80 thread.All in all, having used the trimmer head for a few months now I can honestly say that this has made my trimming/edging work so much better."
4,Universal trimmer head,"This trimmer is a good universal trimmer head. FYI, The description only states it will fit straight shaft trimmers. On the package it lists it will also fit the following curved shaft trimmers: Cub Cadet Commercial, Echo, Husqvarna, kawasaki, Makita, Shindaiwa, Stihl. It comes with several feet of .105 trimmer line."
1,Poor quality,"This replacement head is very poor quality--it is made of a soft plastic that grinds away easily when doing the ""bump"" action to advance the trim line. Also, the trim line does not easily advance--many times I have to stop the trimmer, turn it upside down and push the bump button manually and pull on the strings with my hands. Neither the ""bump"" nor the ""feed"" work consistently. It seems to cause more frustration than it solves."
1,JUNK!,"I didnt buy it on amazon because I was in a hurry. Doesn't fit the greatest, had to add it to the existing. Didnt even make it through the first day! Total junk now Im looking on amazon"
1,Not Worth It!,"I first received this product about 2 years ago, and began using it as a ""private"" TV viewing device. My main complaint is that it's not worth the money. If used in a medical setting for occasional use, it might stand up better. After 6 months, one of the earpieces had to be replaced, which the original company did at no cost. After the 6th month warranty, you need to pay ""big bucks"" to have the glasses repaired. After about a year, it began to corrode. The part that fits against your forehead has started to come unglued, leaving a sticky substance on your forehead. Sound in one earpiece is completely gone and just dangles beside your ear. They provide no care instructions or case. The glasses were used by an adult (media specialist) daily to watch TV. For $1,000, I would have expected better quality and longer use. I'm looking for an alternative and I don't plan to pay close to $1,000 for it! When it comes to these iglasses, my advice is just pass!"
1,do not buy this,"I bought this beause at the time it had one 5-star review. I now suspect from the company that makes it. First of all, the quality isn't that high. The resolution is ok, but the color density is not that good. Probably good enough for movies. I bought it to play with my XBox - big mistake. Then, after 30 days it broke. They fixed it, but I believe the cheaper versions would have been just about as good and not this large investment. I really regret having bought these.Truly, avoid this product. Quality and relability are low."
4,Great for snake lovers,"We bought this kit for our son for Christmas because he's a big fan of ""wiggly snakes"". He was at first delighted to see how many came in the package (by the way, when you open the shipping box, the snake kit is only wrapped in a clear platic bag, so you might want to get a nice box to put it in if you're planning to give this as a gift)but after messing with the snakes for a few minutes, he lost interest. The worst part was trying to get him to paint the snakes because he and I both knew there wasn't even close to enough paint to cover them all and make them all look good. So he only painted one of them really well and left the rest of the paint to dry up. All in all, it's probably a good gift for a child that likes to do crafts or is patient enough to sit still and really work on them. Otherwise I'd suggest just buying the ""snake lover"" one that is already painted."
1,INACCURATE INFORMATION,"This book is horrible- In addition to claiming that Tolstoy wrote ""crime and punishment"" instead of dostoyevsky, they also claim that someone named Lee Harper (instead of Harper Lee) wrote ""to Kill a Mockingbird""- They also claim that Harper Lee (or as they like to call it, Lee Harper) was African American. Found many many other errors in this book and in the pretest located at the end, there were many grammatical errors and answers that made no sense (with no explanations for the answers)-- This company seems to have cornered a very new market but rather than giving into their poorly edited piece of misinformation, find a few nicely edited english anthologies and familiarize yourself with genres of literature and you will be able to to well on the exam. I take the test in a week and now I am forced to double check all ""facts"" i have learned from this book with the internet since I am not trusting anything that comes out of this book. DO NOT BUY."
2,An elementary solution to a complex issue...,"OK...maybe I am expecting too much. I am a consultant who has non-profit clients as well as for-profit clients. I was looking for a book I could refer to non-profits to help their accounting personnel through the for-profit to non-profit transition.I found the book extremely elementary. It is more a flowchart of procedures than a book of methodology. For example, there is very little explanation of accounting principles behind the flowchart instructions. I was especially looking for a better explanantion of setting up fund centers by using the class options. It simply is not designed to teach... only to preach.I wish someone had reviewed the item prior to my purchasing it, then maybe I would have made a more informed choice."
1,A useless book,"Fourteen pages (including front and back covers) of totally useless information. I was looking for a book that would help me with non-profit fund accounting using QuickBooks -- and this is not it. When the first page (of the 12 information pages) is taken up with showing the author in the lotus position, you know you have just wasted your money. The book has some colorful, simple minded flow charts -- and that is about it."
4,Amazing background on Red Dwarfs star,"This book is rather amazing. No Irish, No Niggers is theautobiography of comedy performer and star of ""Red Dwarf"",Craig Charles. It goes on to tell about his RSC years, his comedian lifestyle and a bit about ""Red Dwarf"". On another note it goes beyond and leads into the somewhat darker side of Craigs life, including addictions to drugs and other interesting things not many people know of. Craig is also the author of a book of his own poems called No Other Blue, of which is a great addition to his ""Lighter"" side. Compared to some autobiographies this one is somewhat interesting, don't know why but its rather fascinating all the same"
1,Suitable for Halloween,"Decidedly UNsexy. The 99cent Store has better things for sale in October. The feel is cheap, coarse, fuzzy. It will make you feel cheap, coarse, fuzzy. Ugh!"
5,GREAT FIT!!!!,"I was so worried ordering these that my plus size figure would not be able to wear these. Thank goodness, I was proven wrong. I wear a 22/24 pant size and these fit me wonderfully! I mean I was able to pull these on without any pulling ot tearing the hose. Once on they definitely, look just like the picture. Very comfortable to wear under jeans, a long dress or nothing at all..LOL. I'll be ordering a few more pairs soon."
4,hose,"these hose are great, easy access, comfy, feel great and very sexy even on us big girls give them a try ladys"
2,Cartoon contents and Tape ripoff,Here's the cartoon contents1. The Pied Piper of Hamelin (from Cosgrove-Hall)2. Cinderella (aslo from Cosgrove-Hall)3. The Headless Horseman (an Ub Iwerks cartoon)4. The Ugly Duckling (Tales of Magic short)This DVD had been ripoff of a tape because of the tape slides
1,"Ugly basket, difficult to guage watering","The chain is really shiny, the plastic liner shows through and the moss dries out and gets everywhere. Because of the plastic liner, there is no drainage and it's easy to overwater. If you water less, it's easy to underwater. The plants all died. Very disappointed."
2,Saliva's debut: A flawed album release,This is the self titled debut album released in 1997 that showed 'Saliva' to the music world. This is a flawed release for the 13 track CD did not flow harmoniously or correctly from one song to the other but ended up sounding like a garbled mess of sound and thrashing lyrics being sung punk and rap style song by song from the lead vocalist. This is one album release I didn't enjoy and one album that won't be played in my music library for a long time to come. The only two songs worth listening to out of the 13 songs are 'Beg' and 'Suffocate'. This is a very unclear album release by Saliva and I pray they can only get better from this dismal failure. This is another missable album by Saliva.
3,No Lead No Rock but...,"No lead, oh that hurts; but these guys know how to make a song work. So, they get two stars for that. They get another star for originality---but I like the clean version. These tunes have a flow and they know when to pause and the drummer knows when things need to pick up and the vocals are harrowing. A solid effort but no lead, just metal-pedals and feedback-reverb. This is great, superb board music and song #4 Spitshine, will work at any fraternity party; and with strobe lights.No lead no rock but it moves and you can bang against something or someone. Buy this."
2,Stick with the more recent stuff,"I really love Saliva's newer stuff and I haven't regretted buying ""Six Seconds"" or ""Back into your System"" once. Even their one song on the ""Daredevil"" soundtrack is awesome. But if you're used to that level of production/songwriting, this first self-titled CD will be a dissapointment. It only stands to reason that this CD isn't as good as their later stuff. Everyone that works hard gets better with time."
4,"different, but still good.","This saliva independant release sounds alot more rock than their later releases. I like this cd because its not as produced out of its ass like on the other albums, its straight up Saliva. Hip hop is definatly not part of this cd. So if you are wondering what saliva sounded like before they hit it big, check this out, its worth the price. My favorite song would have to be ""Beg"" and ""Sand Castle""."
5,excellent debut,saliva is now the new next big band and this is one hell of a start. josey scott has one beautiful voice. the music is quite mixed. mostly on the heavy side but there is a mix of styles from punk to metal and some rap/hip hop influenced metal but always melodic and always good. i think saliva truly stand on their own as far as style. nobody sounds like them and they sound like no one. there are obvious influences but i think they mix it up well.
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"Forget the negative reviews from the KJVO's (King James Onlyists) who believe that God only speaks to us through the KJV. Dr. Comfort clearly shows that God is alive in today's Bibles.Dr. Comfort gives FACTS and does an amazing thing: He gives PROOF and EVIDENCE of those facts. You won't find that in Riplinger, Ruckman, Jones, and the multitude of KJO's on the net.If you have ever dealt with a overzealous KJV Only supporter you know they will throw out verses ""missing"" in modern versions (as if they had the Originals to compare them to!). Dr. Comfort explains the verses clearly and with FACTS!This is a top notch book! Read it today!"
2,I'm the author,"Just for everyone's information -- and my own ego -- although I am listed as the author of both the first and second editions of this book, and I did write the first edition, the second edition was produced without my participation. I take NO responsibility for the second edition. I am currently updating the book, and a third edition, written in the style of the first edition, will be available soon.Jo Lynn Southard"
3,Slow reading,"This book starts off great, fast reading full of information, but then gets humdrum. Keep a dictionary with you while reading it."
2,Dont waste your money,"DO NOT WASTE your money on these. They are very heavy, and do not stay closed. I have almost lost them each time I have worn them. They are now in the BOTTOM of my jewelry box. I do like the look of them-they just are not wearer-friendly!"
5,A fascinating page turner,"I have to admit that I shied away from this at first. Why?Well, it takes place in Russia - in Siberia, no less - and thoseRussian names - wouldn't they be a problem?Then I began reading. This is a fascinating page turner, withcharacters as real as your friends and neighbors - and their names?No problem. And the setting? Simply adds to the aura of danger,mystery, and the shades and nuances of character and plot.This man can write! And now I want to read the rest of this series."
3,puzzling resolution: semi-spoiler alert,"I enjoy the books in this series for the pictures they paint of life in the USSR (and later Russia), of the landscape and of people's daily lives. However, I am surprised that (I believe) this particular one was nominated for an Edgar.I found the ending of one of the subplots puzzling. Unless I missed something, A initiated an affair with B to be able to convince B to kill C who was going to reveal a secret. But the secret seems to have been that A and B were having an affair, which was begun only to protect ""the secret."" Do we have a chicken and egg problem here?Another problem is the frequency of information presented late in the novel in which the character says ""... But you must have read that in my file."" And, yes, Rostnikov has known this all along but the readers have been led down the garden path into making logical but erroneous assumptions. Is this totally cricket?"
5,Great Peanut Butter,"While not simply made from peanuts and salt, this is great peanut butter. I've bought other brands of natural peanut butter for several years, and while needing to stir them certainly isn't the end of the world, it does get annoying. Besides that, the taste of other brands--while okay--seemed to lack something.Skippy, on the other hand, does taste great... I think it is better than any other brand or type of peanut butter. I am a ""moderate"" health nut and I do not consider the sugar and palm oil to be that bad. 2 grams of sugar won't kill you. Palm oil, while it does contain saturated fat, it is also a natural source of vitamins A and E. As for the saturated fat, unless you are eating a whole container of peanut butter a day or have other major sources of saturated fat, it won't kill you."
1,Disgraceful marketing tactic,I think Skippy labels this product 'natural' to confuse people. There is NOTHING natural about adding sugar and palm oil. They want you to think it's just peanuts and salt. Anyone who does not read the list of ingredients is screwed!
1,Misleading,"This is not a natural peanut butter. The listed ingredients are peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt. Natural peanut butter, such as Smucker's and Whole Foods contain only peanuts and salt. Palm oil is not a healty oil and is not recommended for cholesterol patients."
2,Peanut Butter?,"This peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy Skippy. A lack of flavor and dry texture makes me wonder if by ""palm oil"" they meant to write ""socks"". Thoroughly disappointing, I only finished the one jar I bought because peanut butter is a staple in my diet and I wasn't about to waste it. Buy the real all natural peanut butters or even the cheap store brand which contains Fully Hydrogenated oils which are fine for you unlike Partially Hydrogenated ones."
4,Pleasant yarn set on the James Bay in Northern Ontario,"This review is for A Countess from Canada: A Story of Life in the Backwoods. I found it to be an enjoyable, easy-to-read, morally clean romance that takes place in the 1800's in the Canadian wilds. The main character is Katharine, a young woman with a lot on her shoulders who runs a trading post in a remote area of Canada. (Place names include Akiminski Island, Mattagami River, Abbitibbi River, Hannah Bay, Lake Temiskaming, Fort Garry, Marble Island [800 miles away], Maxokama, Seal Cove, Roaring Water Portage). Detailed characterizations of the local people.Subtract one star if you are not fascinated by realistically portrayed details of the rigors of Canadian pioneer life. Also note that this work reflects the prevailing views about the native people of the time (dirty, thieves). I found the story line to be little unbelievable and predictable at times, hence the four stars."
5,I love V Diaries,I love this show and the fact I got a great deal is even better. it came packaged well and was not damaged. so I'm happy!
5,Love TVD! :),"I have all other seasons, so I had to buy this one! Love it:) I just wished Amazon Instant Video streamed a little better, it takes awhile to connect but it may just be my connection, idk!If you love TVD, this is a must own!"
2,video quality,It takes a long time for the video to load and then once it does the video quality is not good. I would have bought hd but that video never loaded. Netflix and hulu have you download video playing software when you sign up with them to help you watch things. Maybe that is an idea you could think about. My videos on those site load fine typically and have a great picture while watching. I really like being able to have this option to buy them on your site but just wish I was receiving a better product. But overall I love Amazon!
5,Loved this season!,"This season was my favorite. The characters have grown in their rolls and the plots have thickened. It was definately worth the money I spent and I am looking forward to next season. If you like vampires, werewolves and witches then this is the show for you!"
5,Incredible *SPOILER ALERT*,"A great third season to a terrific series. Full of lover's quarrels, dangerous resurrections, and plot twists that will keep even the most devoted fans guessing, I highly recommend this season and series. My favorite part, an ending you can't imagine that has me hovering over my computer, ripping out my hair in frustration that I have to wait for the next season."
1,RESTRICTONS,I recently saw a review from another person complaining about the restrictions on instant video for this season. I love this season but am having the same issues. I would love to be able to watch the episodes but cannot do so because I am stationed overseas. I too feel as if this unfair due to the fact that I am a US citizen and have a US address. This makes no sense to me especially since Itunes allows the episodes to be downloaded. I can understand there would be issues if the product was free such as with Hulu etc but if I am willing to pay for them why not. Also now what am I supposed to do with my instant download credit? I can't do anything with it while overseas. I love this season but instant video on Amazon needs to have some adjustments made.
1,I hate these restrictions!!!,"I'm in the US Military, serving overseas, but since I'm outside of the US, I cannot watch anything from Amazon downloads! I am a US citizen and it's not fair that I have to wait until the whole season becomes available on DVD or Blu-Ray to see these episodes! I'm willing to pay for these episodes just like anyone else, so why can't I purchase these episodes just because I'm stationed overseas! I do have a US credit card and my billing address is a US address, so what's the big deal??? Aside from that, I LOVE THE SERIES!"

2,PRODUCT NOT THE GREATEST. . .,"I LOVE THE VAMPIRE DIARIES. . . Don't get me wrong. The dvds were just badly packaged inside the case. When I received the item discs 4 and 5 were loose. I was hoping it would not be scratched so badly that I couldn't view them, but it was. I was highly disappointed about how these discs fit into the case. The seller did however give me a refund and was very cooperative. I went and bought the season from Wal-mart and it was packaged differently than the one from here and was more sensible in how it was packaged."
3,VampireDiariesReview,Initially I was very pleased with the product. The first four discs were great. Then when I tried to watch the fifth disc there was nothing on it. Disappointed would be the appropriate word.
5,Great,Product arrived brand new and in a short amount of time. Good customer service and easy to work with. Highly recommended
5,Love it!!!,"Vampire Diaries is a show that I can enjoy with my teenage daughter. We both love the twists involved between Elaina, Damon, and Stephen. Such a magnetic show!!!!"
5,Vampire Diaries - 3,"I bought this DVD because I have Seasons 1 and 2. I wanted to complete my collection. I love this show! If Santa doesn't bring me Season 4, I'll buy it for myself."
3,The Vampire Diaries: The Complete Third Season,"The video quality is good but it would be nice to have the option to download to my desktop, so I don't have any broadband internet charges."
5,Great episode,"This episode is really good, in this episode you get to learn about The Originals and how they became vampires, everything about their family. It's really interesting. The story of how they became vampires is very clear,easy to understand and it all makes sense, whoever the writer is, did an excellent job. If vampires were real the story they made up for this episode seems like a great fit. Most vampire movies/shows never explain where vampires came from...but really good episode"
3,Had to see them all,"Story is cheesy, characters shallow - but Damon, you are sooooo hot! Gotta have to see them all once you started, just like a bag of chips. You know it's not good for you, but you eat them anyway."
5,:O The ending of this season is to die for!,"I absolutely love this show. The DVD's came to me in perfect condition, and I've had no issues with them."
5,VAMPIRE BITES!,ENJOY THE VAMPIRE MOVIES.SPECIAL TREAT DURING HALLOWEEN WEEK.MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE A TRUE VAMPY.HOPE THE SAGA CONTINUES ANOTHER SEASON.
5,Vampires,We are the generation that loves vampires. If you do love books about them then you will love this show because it has everything in it. There are unexpected things that happen.
5,COMPLETELY ADDICTED!,"This series pulls you in from the start. While I enjoy The Twilight Saga and that story line, The Vampire Diaries is far more intense with the storyline, the relationships, the action... plus, in addition to vampires and werewolves, you have a 3rd element with witches. I am completely addicted and block off my Thursday evening every week just for this show. It's by far my favorite thing to watch on TV. I hope this series continues for many seasons to come! P.S. I'm in my 30's - so it's not just for teenagers!! :O)"
5,Love it! Cant get enuff!,Wonderful! Can't get enuff! Hurry up 4th season. Keeps you on edge and is romantic in a bloody vampire kind of way.
2,The show started to go stale,"This show was great at pulling in an audience, but it felt so glum by the time it got very far into the third season. I think it kind of peaked too early and then it just felt like it was trying too hard to maintain intensity after that. I will compliment their creativity in the little twists to the story. If this story was not so deeply morbid and depressing, the twists and turns might keep my attention. Plus, it felt like they just kept trying to add more sexual stuff to make it more dramatic or something. It just ended up making the whole thing whorish and lame. Someone bring back ""Pushing Daisies""."
5,"Vampire Diaries, Season 3: delivery great","DVD arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Discs played, inner materials included. Everything as expected. (And I enjoyed the season as well.) Thanks!"
5,Love this show,Great quality video and very easy to use. I really enjoy this show and I like not watching the commercials!
5,great series,The plot gets better every season I wait for the next episode before I finish the one i am watching. I love Damon He is everything a Vampire shoud be.
5,For the Love of 'The Originals'!,"I loved this episode because we got to see The Originals (esp Klaus) before they were vampires, giving us a peek into their world when they were living in Mystic Falls before it even came to be. I love season 3 because the show not only brought in new characters, but took us on a new journey as far as the story line went. I have a feeling this is just a tip of the iceberg as far as what we know about the Originals. They've been alive for so long I'd love to see them with their own spin-off. They have so many more stories to tell."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,The Vampire Diaries is an amazing show. One episode in this season made me sob for like twenty minutes. I don't know many teen dramas that have that kind of emotional impact!
4,Great Buy,"The feature quality and sound are excellent. I did not have any issues watching any episodes that were included in this season. What I like about buying these products is that I don't have to worry about losing or accidentally breaking it, like I would a DVD. This will stay on my account forever and it's comforting to know that :) Thanks Amazon!"
3,Not enough episodes.,"Are the writers getting tired of this script? It definietly shows! This season was cut off too quickly and leaves the viewer with a lot of unfinished, loose ends. Not as eventful as other seasons. Probably because they turned Elena into a vampire and there isn't much of a story line to hang on to humanity."
4,Good over all,There was a tiny flaw to packaging but I'm still a satisfied customer over all. I would buy here again.
5,Love those young Vampires,"Have all of the previous seasons of the Vampire Diaries series so had to have this one also. Will really enjoy watching this over and over again as the entire family, adults that is, love this series and look forward to it coming back. Have already ordered the 5th season, even though it hasn't been released yet."
5,guilty pleasure,"this show is a guilty pleasure for me, so of course I'm going to give it a rave review! Actually, all things considered, this show is very well done. Granted, it can get a bit cliched and frustrating at times, but it keeps my attention and drags me in every week there's a new episode. The cast is fantastic and this is one of the few instances that I can say the ""movie"" (or in this case, show) is better than the book."
5,For my teen,"I purchase a new one every Christmas and will continue to do so until it no longer airs! My daughter loves this show, but doesn't have time to watch it on the scheduled night so very convenient that we get the entire season."
5,Awesome,"Love the show and love the DVD extras! I own every season. The bloopers are my favorite, but I like the unaired scenes as well."
5,Best of the Best Vampire shows,"I have been a fan since S1E1. The characters are so richly developed and interesting. I love the interplay between Elena, Damon and Stephan. So much sexual tension going on. Love it. I can't wait to see where season 4 takes us. Waiting on the release of the third season to tide me over."
5,Amazing!,Vampire Diaries!!! Yes! This is an Awesome series. There are so many plot twists and the characters stories are written very well. Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy? Who cares? I love them all!
5,Great Product,"The item was deliver when expected brand new, excellent product I would recommended to any one. Would buy more of the episodes."
5,"WOW, just WOW!","I must say that this series surprised me. I thought it would be Twilightish but I was wrong. Yes, vampires and werewolves roam free but the writing is amazing and the whole production is simply amazing. I love every moment that I watch and I laugh, cry and morn with each character. Damon is my favorite as he is for many because of his wit and charm but also because he is seriously hot. But I love Damon for every reason and I couldn't imagin the show without him. So thank you to the writers, actors and whoever else supports the show and helps to make it great! Can't wait for more seasons to come!"
5,"Once you""re hooked.......you're hooked",I received the first and second season of Vampire Diaries for Christmas and loved them. So I had to get season three and so far it has not disappointed.
3,Ok show,I stopped watching this show during season 3. It just stopped being interesting for me. There are too many more interesting shows out there.
5,IN LOVE,i love this show. i have been a fan since the books first started filtering out and the show is just amazing. i do find it funny that season 3 isnt even finished yet and they are already advertising for pre-sale lol.
5,Best episode YET!,I LOVE this show but don't always get to catch it when it's on TV. Amazon always has the new episodes faster than Hulu and the CW site. I don't know what I would do without Amazon's instant video. Now I never have to miss Damon and Stephan ;)
5,THE VAMPIRE DIARIES S3 DVD,"Im a 27 yr old male, an after work i love to watch tv when im home just looking for awesome shows to watch and im a huge VAMPIRE/WEREWOLF Fan i go way back to THE LOST BOYS kind of fan..

5,Love this series!,This is a great series and blue ray quality is the best! 4 discs have a great feature that hold wallpaper screen on your tv while you switch to next disc. Only annoyance is that I purchased this a week before the entire 3rd season became available on Netflix streaming. Although I am still happy to own blue rays.
1,I am yet to receive this book,The tentative date of receipt is 27th Jan 2006 but to i haven't received the book as of today.Pls send same asapArul
4,Good Book for the beginners,This book is very useful for the beginners as well those who want to brush up their knowledge on oracle applications release 11i.Mostly it covers all Manufacturing & Distribution modules. Financial modules are not covered in this book. I was planning to buy a book and searching for it and finally ended up in buying a very useful book.Main drawback is not much of screen captures displayed. So if you want to better understand you have to read it by sitting in front of applications screen and switching the forms as you read.Overall the book is worth having it.
3,Echobridge At It Again,"I give it 3 starts since you can finally get part 3 at a decent price, but long behold Part 3 is full screen and has a terrible transfer. Bloodline however is Widescreen, so only pick this is up if you don't have part 3 but even then the transfer and full screen kills it. Disappointing."
2,Mixed Bag,"The only positive thing I can about this version of ""Hellraiser III"" is that it's uncut, even though the case is labeled with an R-rating. Quite unfortunately, the movie is not in widescreen. Worse, it's a dark, muddy-looking transfer. There is no excuse for this. I'm guessing it came from an old VHS master. ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" fares much better with an crisp, anamorphic widescreen presentation and it's the best it's ever looked on home video. Go figure."
2,jesus wept.........cuz this dvd sucks!,"i was at wal mart the other day. and i found this set and the 5 dollar bucket, i was like oh ok ill get this its 5 bucks! when i got home i open the dvd. it was one disc! i put the dvd in my ps3. and when i saw the dvd menu, i was like wtf! it looks like something that was made from windows dvd maker! i really dont bitch about this to much. but this is a poor dvd set!"
1,Good for 12 months than garbage,"We've gone through two of these now. In both cases, they work for about a year, then they start jamming in the back, then a small metal strip on the back door gets bent and then they are toxic waste.We used the scanner almost every work day, but only for small jobs -- well under 50 pages/day.Canon makes some good products, but this isn't one of them."
1,SHAME on CANON!!,"I have purchased 4 of these scanners for my document scanning business and EACH ONE needed to be replaced or repaired about a year or so after the purchase date. They DO work great for a year, but after that they jam or only scan half of a document. I have NEVER EVER written a ""product review"" on ANY website, but hopefully this review will save you from the disappointment & headaches I've experienced with this product (4 times). Canon MUST be aware of all the issues this scanner has and yet they continue to sell it (and for such a high high dollar amount). Shame on Canon!"
1,Not Happy,The feed on the product does not work properly. When a stack of documents is placed on the scanner it will try to pull all or several of the documents. WE have made several adjustments and the problem has not been resolved.
4,beautiful retro style pictures,"Such a lovely book, the illustrations are wonderful. Wish it had a cover that allowed more inserts/pictures to fit inside and still shut flat."
5,Love it-why is it no longer available?!,"I have purchased several of these books to give as gifts, and the new moms are so pleased with them. The pictures are precious and sweet. I am so disappointed that they are not in print any more. Can anyone tell me why this is?"
3,Traveller Moon,"I expected the journal to be larger based on other paperblank journals I have purchased. It would be helpful to have the dimensions listed in the description of the journal. I like the journal, I would just prefer it to be larger."
3,Baroque music,Typical baroque music that does not reach to the qualities of Vivaldi or Bach music. Sometimes sound like imitations of the above
4,I like this phone,I like this phone alot. it allows me phone access in rooms where i dont have phone jacks but have electrical outlets. good quality sound and many features on this phone. It truly is a freedom phone allowing me to work outside and still have the phone near me! I love it!
1,SEVERELY ANNOYING,"Ok FINE, i understand how some people can rate this CD with 5 stars..which is cool, but i took a listen to this album a coupla days before and thought it was the MOST annoying CD ever made. The artist was surely high when this recording was made. Its fun to listen ONLY once but to spend a few bucks on it..would be a sheer waste. Its a kiddie album, extremely shallow and genuinely dumb. Buy it ONLY if you are suffering from chronic personality disorder. Nuff' Said!"
1,Not even funny in the least bit,I like funny rappers who have some talent at least. I do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all. And even the people that I know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they don't like it at all by the third time. Truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke. Avoid this one.
2,JOKE GETS OLD,"Jesse Foreman-a country boy from Mississippi- may be smartto record the dirty but well-written[yes,well-written] anti-drugparody ""Because I Got High"",but this novelty music for thedumps.But anyway isn't that what novelty music is?Afromanwill join Baha Men,Lou Bega,Vengaboyz,and Aqua in ""funny"" noveltymusic hall of fame."
1,If you listen to this filth...,"I guarantee that you will hear your I.Q. dropping as the lyrics are made out. Listen slowly, and your brain will slowly climb to a boil and then finally....BAM! You die!The end. There is no more. You can learn and grow no more.You fade into existence like this oh-so-talented ""rapper"" should. He really needs to grow up and leave the music to the pros!!1 star. I'd give it less if it were possible.Pros *-It's ""funny""-If you're a degenerate then you will enjoy this.-Simple melodies and mindless lyrics.-His voice is OK. It's got something to it. But that's ALL he has going for him.Cons *-If you like music with a point, avoid this like the Black Plague.-Terrible, repetitive beats.-Another talentless rapper ""on the rise"".-He will make all black people in America look bad, as if we all smoke trees and drink all day instead of volunteering our time and having a job worth going to.What a loser!"
5,way better then the only sinle,buy the album its alot better then the only single becouse i got high would lead you to belive
3,Why this album?,"Simple, unless you were lucky enough to discover him about a year before Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, this is the only option you have. Personally, I happen to own ""Sell Your Dope"" and ""Because I Got High"" as I discovered him a long time ago in a record store in Birmingham, AL.While others mocked me, I waited patiently for Afroman to be ""discovered"" and when that finally happened I was the one laughing because everyone else was stuck with this very good but simultaneously watered down version of a great CD.My advice to all of you: Buy this album but search EVERY record store for a few straggler copies of the original two."
5,Afroman...times are good,"If you want to chill out....and listen to some really good rap, this is it. There is no really heavy and violent message to this CD. It's all about chillin and not worrying so much about life. There is a good mix of music and while the lyrics are explicit, it's done in a way that's not too offensive. Sure, Afroman get the point across using rough language, but it's often entertaining and fun. If you want to kick back and enjoy the relaxation of your choice, then Afroman will help take you there."
3,Afroman,"This is a cd with only one instrument on the whole thing. There may be more, but I only hear one in every song and that's drums. It a kinda rap/minor beat thing with lyrics that will either make you bust out laughing or smack you right in the face. It's a pretty kool cd. There's not much you can say about Afroman!"
4,"Jason Moran, pushing the limits of jazz","i was amazed upon hearing Soundtrack to Human Motion, Jason Moran's first recording as a leader. It showed his individualistic style, his great composition skills and his all around wonderful musicianship. and Facing Left is more of the same. although only a trio album, it has power. Moran on piano, Fender Rhodes, and Hammond b3, Tarus Mateen on bass, and Nasheet Waits on drums create amazing textures and colors on these six Moran pieces and seven interpratations. The two Ellington pieces smoke. Moran mixes bits of the avant garde with classic jazz. he realizes that his elders in jazz are very important. but he also realizes that he can not tread in their foot steps. he quickly runs past them. the album is great, buy it and support a true artist pushing the limits of jazz."
2,Great for the first year. Then DANGEROUS.,"We've had our kapoosh for over a year now, and while it was down right awesome at first (we have a Frankenstein knife collection - all from different sets), the knife holder is now too dangerous to be used. Each section (there are two on this model) is made of individual plastic ""hairs"" that are bound together at the bottom. After fairly regular use, these hairs bend and fold until one can no longer insert a knife fully into the block. We now have our knives only half way in (as they will not go down any further), and have had them FALL OUT onto the floor on multiple occasions. With a toddler in the house, it just doesn't really make sense to keep this thing around any longer. Too bad."
3,"It's OK, just be careful washing the removable rods","We own a Kapoosh Stainless Steel Knife Holder and have used it for the last few months. We washed the removable rods once (in the dishwasher) according to the directions. We store five ot six knives in the main holder, and found that after a few months use, the removable rods don't accept knives completely into the holder any more.We contacted the manufacturer's customer service dept [...] and found that returning it to the retailer was the only recourse: ""you can try returning it to the store you purchased it from and see if they will do an exchange for you. I really don't know what the problem would be especially after washing the insert. The rod can become twisted and bent inside the unit if you store too many and too large of knives in it.""We're going back to a wood knife block."
2,Inserts damage over time,Been using this for a little over 1 year and the plastic inserts eventually bend and prevent the larger knives from going all the way in. Loved it in the beginning and now hate it.
2,No more push in kapoosh,"At first the kapoosh was fantastic. There is a large and small section for you to organize your knives and the universal plastic rods let you organize your knives however you want, with whatever sizes. However, after using it for about 3/4 of a year, we found that it was harder and harder to get the knives inserted. After doing some investigating, we realized that the plastic rods are fused together at the base and slide out altogether. Many of the rods were getting bent or broke off.the plastic rods were s if you had long straight hair and hairs were getting matte, tangled and bent in some areas of the scalp. Once this happens this knife block becomes impossible to use. I don't how how you avoid this happening...maybe being really careful when you slide in knives and definitely don't put in things that have more of a thick or blunt edge (like scissors or thicker knives)."
4,Functional but not deep,Useful and served the purpose but some of my knives were too long and didn't fit all the way in. But I still like it and use it.
3,Bigger than expected,"This knife block is pretty large, way bigger than I expected. But the knives don't even go all the way down the height of the unit. It's pretty big on your counter surface & only holds up to 5 larger knives in the top section & a few really small ones in the lower section. It doesn't like cheese knives - due to the holes in the knife that get caught on the rods in the unit. I thought it was some kind of foam in the block, but it's weird plasticky rods compressed together. It's ok but I think it's priced WAY too expensive & worth about half the price."
2,After a couple years it no longer works,"I'm not sure how long you would expect a knife holder to last, but since year 3 this has not been up to snuff. It's now nearly impossible to get a knife more than halfway in the holder, and we did not overstuff it at all. We washed it only a couple times since purchase. I think I'd rather go back to wood."
4,Not your mama's knife holder,The Kapoosh is more than a knife holder it's a piece of art. It's convenient to use and it's beautiful. I bought one for my husband (me) and my two sons for father's day they were pleased. My son who works as a special ed teacher in a special ed school told me about it because it was being used at the school and he loved it.
2,Can't recommend...,"Great idea, executed as well as can be but not all knives are compatible. I am an avid home cook and use my knives a lot, so this unit gets well used. The stainless steel `shell' leaves the tracks of the plastic top & bottom . When you wash it in the dishwasher--it take days to dry...actually I wasn't satisfied that it was dry enough even when running paper towels through the rods. (I live in So. CA so there wasn't much humidity that affected the dry time.) I had to cut numerous rods out that as other reviewers pointed out become bent with normal use so that I could get my knives back in. Yes, it works, but only short term, which is not a `successful' product in my eyes.Bottom line: If you only have a few knives with straight edges and don't cook much, then maybe this is for you. If you want some serious knife storage, look elsewhere."
5,perfect,"This fits our decor and holds a wide variety of knives. I was amazed at how many knives it held, lots of room."
4,Serves It's Purpose,"So far so good with the Kapoosh. I got it as a gift and have put it to use with my new knives as well. I do get the feeling that this may dull knives much faster but time will tell. It also gets more and more tough to get knives in at the beginning but will loosen in time. It has been good so far and plan to continue use. If it does start dulling though, I will be pulling the block that came with the knives out."
1,"Good, bad, and ugly","I like the idea of this product -- easy storage of knives of various shapes and sizes. And the form of the product is fine -- not particularly fancy, but serviceable. However, after owning this ""stainless steel"" box for about 2 months, it started to stain or corrode around the base. Rats."
3,"excellent story, questionable execution.","I heard so much about this novel, that I had to read it for myself...Well, there is no doubt that Gates' plot is a doozy and there are scenes of undeniable power and menace. I was not, however, completely sold here. The problem lies in Gates writing (and believe me, I am not an overly critical reader). I found it to have a streak of immaturity. It was redundant, explained to much and Gates seemed to have an 18 year old's grasp of the real world. An example: the protagonist quits teaching, goes back for his masters on money he saved up (hah) and writes his thesis paper on; get this: ""american poets""....That's like a geologist writing a paper on ""rocks"". I wish I had professors that leinent!...Thats just one example...I would have given this novel 3.5 stars if I could. It does have an undenible power and contains some gruesomely effective scenes, if you can get over some occasionally cloddish writing."
3,UTTERLY DEPRAVED,"I can't remember even having read a novel that takes such hard-edged social taboos and treats them with a light-handed touch of exploitation. Still, even with all it's unpleasentness, it's a very imaginative work of horror fiction that almost defies the readers to have their stomachs re-coated with cast-iron. Gates only real flaw as a writer is an overly wordy pacing that dosn't feel professional or literate. It's a bit over-long, though it's hard to forget this one. I just picked up the sequel, GRIM REAPINGS, some years after reading this one, and it's fresher in my mind than most pop novels. Definatly not for the squemish."
2,Grimm Indeed.,"I stumbled upon this book in my local bookstore and figured I would give a previously unknown author to myself a chance. Truly going into this book with an open mind, I was mostly disappointed with the experience afterwards. The story felt somewhat formulaic and the characters were very one-dimensional. Add to that the amount of gratuitous gore and sexually explicit references and it amounts to nothing more than a B movie. I would probably only recommend this novel if it's already sitting on your shelf and you've read everything else."
1,Too Much Of 1 Thing !YUCK!,"I heard what a great book this was... It's NOT... There's sex, preversion, rape. You name it, it's in this book... And the author isn't even really that GooD at writing.... If you don't mind sex every few pages, then this book is for YOU....I found it just sick....I don't consider this horror, in so much as soft porn.... GIVE IT UP R.PATRICK GATES...... YOU STINK!!!!"
3,Intriguing but over-the-top grotesque,"There's a good deal to enjoy here: competent writing, some excellent tension, a fully-fleshed villain, and a sharply imagined 'adult fairy tale'. But the gore and viciousness to the story, done without the slightest element of tongue-in-cheekness (a la Edward Lee) eventually adds up to nothing more than an excessively cruel novel. The intensely detailed scenes of violence done to children...murder, sexual abuse, cannibalism, goes beyond the proverbial pale, and it'll leave you the same."
3,dissapointing,I was excited after reading some of the reviews. However after turning the last page I was very dissapointed. The overall story and characters weren't capturing or interesting to me. I also read Prison by Gates and wasn't thrilled with that either.
4,Strictly for glyphies,"This is a heavy duty text rather than an introduction. If you are just a dumb tourist like myself visiting Copan (there are hardly any inscriptions in Chichen Itza or Northern Yucatan -usually the places with the good inscriptions are hard or dangerous to get to - even Copan right now)and you want to understand the numbers and dates you might be better off with something simpler. In fact, for numbers and dates, old Sylvanus Griswold Morley is quite good (but don't let hard-core glyphies hear you say that). You can buy lots of gizmos with diagrams of the calendar round. I could not understand the Harris and Stearns chapter on astronomy.This stuff keeps getting updated - the University of Pennsylvania issues supplements."
3,Limited,"Toy is a great item for children interested in space and exploration, however the educational value is limited in that the planets do not rotate individually, and the relative sizes of the objects are not accurate. Ends up being just a big nightlight."
1,did not work -returned,This item did not work. Power wasn't getting to the lights or the motion. We used two different sets of batteries but it still did not work. I have already returned it and gotten my refund.
5,Traditional forms + a twist of humor = a blast,"What a refreshing disk this is! I was beginning to lose some of my enthusiasm for Cuban music because a few recent disks have seemed too blatantly commercial and over-marketed, a little too much geared to ride a wave of popularity. Here's a disk where everyone is just having a blast and enjoying the music. There is a fine combination of traditional sounds and rhythms and yet with a little, good-natured, satirical bent. For example, they nod and pay their respects to Perez Prado in the mambo-cha, but with a grin on their faces. Listen to the pizzicati strings, or to the way the piano suddenly barges in. This song and the superb opening track would make the album getting just by themselves. The rest of the tracks are fine, too. Excellent musicianship and ensemble playing, freshness and verve."
4,"Great book, but not very practical","This book was very informative, but you will have to actively translate most of the material into less psychobabble, more realistic (or practical) terms. I am happy I got this book, but many of the handouts are too complex for clients that do not have a high school or above reading level. Being a therapist in a community mental health setting, I found it much more educational than practical. As an educational book, 5 stars. As a practical guide, 3 stars."
3,did i just watch a musical?,"""Movies aren't what they used to be"" is probably what went through my head as i watched this film and i thought hmmm.... hmmmm. hmmmm... I dont tknow what to think, and a film that can make me not know what to think is rather unique. Usually i have an opinion already drawn, and Jekyll and Hide was no exception. Except, asI watched this film on DVD I almost immediately began to think ""This film is what movies used to be."" Well not exactly, but my point is that Jekyll and Hyde felt like a cult film classic. I congratulate the filmmakers for their take on an alreadynteresting story. In my opinino i would try it on for size."
5,I wish I could give this 10 stars!,"I own a 120 year old farmhouse in the South and I am fascinated w/ the history and culture. This book is a JOY! I LOVE reading about the families in the book, the photos are GORGOUS and I have been unable to put this book down! Of all the 'Home' books I've read this is by far my absolute favorite! ENJOY!!!"
2,A bit below the EDN reputation,"I found this book to be informative, however, after reviewing the book and trying to work through the examples I found a tremendous amount of errors, mis-prints and, lack of continuity.I would not recommend this book for the beginner, but for the experienced tech it does offer some unique thoughts."
2,Not for the novice or hobbyist.,"If you are looking for an intro to SMPS's as a novice or hobbyist, forget it. It's not a practical ""how to build..."" book. For someone with some switch mode experience it's not a bad book to have and there is some very valuable information which will benefit all. I was a little disappointed, especially since the book flags the EDN banner . I really expected some more depth and more of a practical approach."
1,Buy something else,"Is this book reviewed before it's published? It contains too many errors, some of which are fundamental. Is it practical, if the design equations are only presented, not explained? Anyway, you can get some ideas for your switching power designs after reading this book."
3,ok,"Someone recommend my husband try this brand for his atheletes foot. Tinactin seems to work better for him. It works though, it does help he said"
1,"no,no,no!!","Sure, the techniques described in this book works from a strictly medical standpoint....that's about the only good I can say about this book. Please,do yourself a favor, and don't put your trust in these pages....(unless you suffer from hybris and suicidal tendencies). What I could recommend for those of you who want to master these kind of skills, is to train the ""military"" branch of ""Krav maga"" (Israeli cqb system)."
2,A Very Basic Book,"I ordered this book thinking that I was going to learn all kinds of fancy moves and stuff that worked- uh uh. It wasvery basic with defense for about 4 puches and 1 kick. You could figure these out w/o the book. It uses the LINE system and teaches basic bayonet fighting and a little bit with knives. Bottom Line, Don''t order this book expecting a lot."
1,Close Combat?,THE FIRST RULE OF UNARMED COMBAT IS NEVER BE UNARMED. People on battle fields don't fight unarmed.This is a very primitive form of close combat. The tecniques described through out the book are repeative and very basic. Any one whos been in a street fight would know these tecniques. I feel sorry for Marines that bought into this system. If your looking for a form of unarmed combat check out Systema.www.russianmartialart.com
3,A word to those who consider this System.,"I use to give instruction in this System when I was in the Service. As you have read the LINE System was discontinued for use by basic Marine positions and taught to the SpecOps communities to add to their encyclopedia of combat due to its ""swift and violent"" action. It should be kept in mind that this System was created and kept ""basic"" as some might say, to keep it simple but effective. It was designed for soldiers who normally do not have the luxury of time on their side, and therefore must react with a rapid and deadly response. To make it anymore advanced and detailed than it is would create too much wasted time in a soldier's reaction time toward an aggressor. Also keep in mind that this System was created for soldier's who are in full battle rattle (all gear worn) where fancy moves and flying kicks are not practical. I will not say this System is great or cool or any other jazz like that, but I will say it is effective in the right hands."
1,This Book WIll Get You Killed Or In Jail,"I am a former Marine and a black belt in Shotokan karate. I was taught and taught others the LINE system while in service and even then, i knew it was ineffective. The moves, punches, countermoves and holds are impractical and difficult to execute in combat. I, along with several others, while going along with the manual, finally boiled the system down to a dozen techniques and drilled with them. The Marines discontinued this system because of the same reasons that I mentioned.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
5,Great Methods,"This is a very good book to read and practice, but there is one problem. Many of the techniques in this book could cause permanent or fatal damage to an apponent. With many this like smashing the windpipe, and grouging the eyeballs, this book is only for those who want to learn to KILL!"
1,"This Book Will Get Marines Killed, not the Enemy","Dear Sir, I am a member of Veterans of Foreign Wars and Vietnam Veterans of America. I have trained in the martial arts for over 30 years. I read this book and just about vomited. This book is a insult to every soldier who ever put on the uniform of the United States Military. But given the political correctness of today's military it does not surprise me in the least. Any marine or soldier who attempts these techniques in battle will likely end up dead. These are not tried and true combative techniques. It looked like a comic book to me with horrible cartoon like drawings of marines. This just made me vomit even more. It is an insult to our military and to our soldiers of the past who already discovered what works and what does not on the battlefield. Whoever wrote this book has no idea of what real military combatives truly entail. I am very disqusted with this book. Save your money and look elsewhere."
2,Don't Bother,I've been a student of Martial Arts and Hand to Hand Combat for coming on 8 years now.Although I geared my training towards sport and fancy moves in the begining I soon learned that this was pointless and dangerous for the type of encounters I was facing on the streets. As a result I enthusiastically begain studying Military and Street fighting arts.I found with this book that the technigues found were out of date and unrealistic. There is also no mention of the mental aspect and effect of combat. The moves are far too complicated for a street encounter.If however you are interested in studying the history of Military Self Defence this book would give you some useful insight.
5,The Best College Text book for Linear Systems and Signals,"In 1996, I bought this book for a class on Linear Systems.After reading the first three chapters of this book,I quickly became very impressed with Author's Style.Lathi's book is well writen and it is very easy to understand.When I took my communication class, I decided to buy Lathi'sModern Digital Communication book even though we were assigneda different class book. Lathi's books are fun to read and learn.I use this book every day as a Reference for my Digital Signal Processing projects."
5,Math and Signals are truly One after this book,"This book has it all: logic, concepts, math, many examples, practical applications, even little historical notes and matlab sections. It's just a very accurate, neat, and well organized book. The guy actually exlains ""why"". He explains not only how to DO Laplace, Fourier, etc but how to UDERSTAND it. And he is very accurate with what and how he is saying. I bought this book for my undergrad systems & signals class for extra reading and thanks to this book it wasn't one of those 'mechanically' learned classes but math actually acquired meaning."
1,Not good for learning,The book lacks simple explanations and does not introduce concepts in an organised manner. I would not recommend this book unless you are already familiar with the basics. It looks like you need a course that follows with the book to really make any use of this text.
1,Student who is required to use this book,This book though lucid in its conversational language does not explain how the author came to his conclusions. Gives examples that the solutions of which are not traceable to the method described and is dirth of the supposed answers to exercises included. As a required text it is a nightmare to an engineering student required to take this couse as a introduction to the subject.David M. Cook (actual name)
4,Should have read what condition it was in,"The book arrived very quickly, but the book was in poor condition, but I guess I should have looked at the sellers condition report before I bought it."
4,An uplifting study,"This brief book (5 chapters, 64 pages) is a simple but uplifting survey of the book of Jonah. Each chapter takes one part of Jonah's story (the chapters are titled In Flight, In Pursuit, Up From the Abyss, Commission, and Compassion), analyzes it, and applies it to the life of a Christian today. Robertson has successfully distilled this important Old Testament book into a study that is both challenging and encouraging. This book is worth far more than its low price, and any Christian should find it to be profitable devotional material."
2,On/Off Switch Needs Work,"The decoy looks realistic enough to fool a predator, but the thing just would not turn on or off without using a pointed object to forcibly depress the switch. I don't know if it was this particular one or the switch itself is poorly designed, but this flaw made the device aggravating to use. Once it got going it moved and jerked around like an injured animal. I ended up sending it back. I never got a chance to use it in the woods, but the theory is sound."
4,Not bad,"Works pretty good but I have not tried it in action as of yet. I hope it has enough ""Quiver"" for something far away to spot it. I may try to add something to the top of it like a wire with a long piece of white fur on it to give it a bit more action. I got it on sale for $21 @ Bass Pro due to never getting any cheaper on Amazon."
1,Buyer Beware,This is a genuine pile of horse dung. I am shocked somebody can sleep at night selling or even manufacture this thing and sleep at night.. As soon as the wind blows it falls of its' perch. Move on to something else and save the headache
4,Coyotes love it.,"In wind it tends to tip a little and just vibrate, but the yotes still come to it! It amazes me that such an intelligent animal would fool with such a dumb looking fake rabbit! I had a couple of back to back shots with this little guy out in front of me! The coyotes are so focused on it that they do not realize that their buddies are getting shot!"
4,quiver critter,Seems to work well. Hard to turn on and off. The base is weak so don't try to force it into hard ground.
3,It Works.,"I have used this decoy about 6 times so far. It works will keep a coyotes attention. The plastic on the base is a little cheap and can break if your not easy with it ( I cracked mine the first day). And you need a hammer to get the stake far enough into the ground, even when it seems like it is soft ground."
3,ZULU WORDS,"Lacks many basic word meaning.e.g. ""Impela"" Dict. ""Truely""Lit. ""Good"",""correct"",""right"". Could also add phonetics of each word"
5,It 's what I looked for.,"I have long planned to buy my first KitchenAid Stand Mixer. After I read many reviews about each model. I found that many reviewers mentioned about noise and motor problems, which is also my concern. However, I finally decided to buy the Artisan Series, Wasabi Green color. When I recieved it, it is what I looked for. The color is pretty and lovely. So far, I 've been using it for 3 months (about twice a week) and there is no problem at all. It is very helpful for making Sponge-type cakes. I didn't have to hold the hand mixer for 10 minutes anymore. I have my free hand to do other things else. I really loved it!"
4,Exactly as advertised,"The battery pack is exactly as advertised, and is working perfectly so far. Not much more I can say. We'll know more after a year or two."
5,Gets rid of bugs,This is the greatest invention since the bug zapper. Well it is a portable bug zapper and works great. No more flies in my house.
3,Have I been zapped?,"I'm not sure that I have purchased a quality product. I accidentally dropped it this morning and then spent about 10 minutes putting the little wires back in place!! Hopefully, I will have a better experience when I actually get to swat something!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought these bug zappers to give as gifts but wanted to try them out before hand. I was disappointed when trying it out. The wires were so far apart, the small bugs went in between wires, therefore not getting zapped. For as much as these costs, not a good purchase. Returned them for a refund and found one that worked better...and less expensive."
2,Cool Zapper...but handle can break,this product is ok. went through two of them already. Cuz the handle is flimzy...handle can break. You have to sqeeze two buttons fo rit to work but i can understand the safety issue
2,"When it's not broken, it works.","I am always chasing after those pesky flies since I live in horse country and my doors and windows are frequently open. I was a zapper user and advocate for several years, until my newest zapper broke almost immediately in the same way my old one did. One of he buttons on the handle that activates the zap, snapped off inside the handle. This is exactly what happened to my previous one (same button). There is no way to fix this, I've tried. I am hesitant to purchase this brand again."
3,it works if you can actually hit the fly,"The hardest part is hitting the fly. If you can do that, it will kill them. If I wave it through a cloud of no-see-ums, it makes contact with a few and chases the rest away for a few minutes. The double switch is hard to hold down and swing at the same time. I taped over one of the switches so I just have to press one button. It's very sensitive to water - I got drops on one and it shorted the whole thing out."
3,Not very powerful.,"Not as powerful as the old bug zapper I was replacing. Deer flies often stunned but not dead. I think I'll try one of the 2 D-cell battery zapper to see if that gives more of a jolt. Voltage probably won't change, though - but perhaps more amperage will make up for unchanged voltage."
1,Bug Zapper from Charcoal Company,"Received the Charcoal Companion Amazing Bug Zapper, opened it up and placed batteries in it and the switch would work only some of the time. It worked better without the battery cover. VERY Cheap, and I would say it is a total waste of your money. Do not buy this one! You are rolling the dice on it. I have one that is the ""Original Bug Zapper"" and it works fine. thompson."
3,Entertaining bug zapper (when not broken),"I liked it when I first got it but after a few weeks it had already broke twice and I'm kind of bored with it. The metal coils all came out the first time (I'm not sure how though?) and I had to put each one individually into each hole (took a good 20 mins) and then the second time I dropped it on accident and all of the coils popped out again. Currently its sitting in my room on the floor with coils popping out in all directions. It was a fun toy for a little while (if you get big enough bugs and leave the zapper on they will eventually fry and make a loud POP) and it does it job, but if it breaks a couple times I'm sure you will see just how frustrating it really is. All in all though it did what it was suppose to, which is why I gave it 3 stars"
5,Better sleep,"With this I won't have more sleepless nights because a mosquitoe is flying by my ear when I am trying to sleep. Kills on contact (instantly) mosquitoes, flies and other flying bugs, so I think there's no time for the insect to suffer."
2,"Flies, rejoice! It has a flaw","Talk about a fun and entertaining way to swat flies! I had a blast attacking a springtime fly swarm when this package first arrived, and I was impressed with its ease of use and effectiveness.BUT...The trigger button on the handle is flimsy plastic, and I hadn't used this very long before the internal connection snapped, rendering my cool new toy -- I mean, fly killer -- into a fairly useless lightweight paddle. I recommend you look for one with a more durable construction.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor"
1,USELESS for flying insects,"At our Block Party I brought it out to use on the yellow jacket - stinging flies; they look like elongated bees, that were after our food. We trapped one under the ""zapper"", singed it and it flew away. Incredibly poorly designed!doesn't kill and can't 'swat' 'em, it's too awkward.An absolute ripoff!I hate it."
3,Decent bug zapper.,"I purchased this item for $8. It takes a modicum of skill to kill smaller insects. However, despite the wide spacing and single layer of electrified wire - I have killed house flies, wasps, mosquitoes and even fruit flies(!) with this product. The construction is relatively flimsy, but if you want a heavy duty identical product, The Sharper Image sells a triple layered mesh swatter for about $40. All in all, worth the price."
1,WORTHLESS - NOT EFFECTIVE,LEARNED MY LESSON - ANYTHING I PURCHASE IN THE FORM OF A BUG ZAPPER... WILL NOT OCCUR AGAIN. NEITHER THE OTHER PRODUCTS NOR THIS ONE - BEING BATTERY OPERATED WORKED....
4,farmer's fly swatter,"I bought the battery-run bug swatter for my farmer friends. That will allow his grandchildren to swat bugs around the barn for ""entertainment"" and to keep another one handy to swat the very pesky flies in the barn. It works!"
5,Works really well,I was happy to see that it really works. It electrocutes stuff but it doesn't lure mosquitoes. UV lamps and chemical attractants simply do not attract mosquitoes. This zapper is perfect for indoor use. I highly recommend it. This is a must have for those of you who live in the tropics like me. This zapper does an excellent job at getting rid of mosquitoes. In the hands of a determined user it is far better than any of the expensive mosquito traps out there. My experience with one trap which supposed to lure and electrocute mosquitoes was poor.
1,Crap,"This is junk, do yourself a favor and buy the one that costs $18 because it is much higher quality. I've gone through 2 of these things, the first one when I tried to insert the battery the connections where the batteries give the device power came out and were deformed in such a way I couldn't put them back in the battery compartment, so I sent it back and ordered another one. The 2nd one seemed to work for like 1 fly, after that it was simply a plastic fly swatter, even when I pressed the button, heard the little sound it makes and tried to kill a fly, it wouldn't kill the fly, nothing would happen. Multipe times I was able to trap the fly underneath the device and despite pushing the button the fly actually flew THROUGH the wholes not getting zapped once. I am done returning this, not once did I receive one that didn't properly work but twice."
1,charcoal companion bug zapper,"I received this item today and it is a piece of junk!!!!!! After you put the batteries in the door won't stay on, it looks like the tab that inserts ooooooooooooooon the battery cover is misshaped. I would not recommend this made to anyone!"
2,Not what I hoped for,"This works pretty well for wasps but is useless for houseflies - either that or I'm just inept. I couldn't catch the flies to buzz them. I'm pretty sure they were mocking me as I tried. For us, this doesn't not replace the old fashioned fly swatter - which I had to go out to the hardware store and buy. This product does seem useful for larger, stinging sorts of insects and might replace chemical bug spray products."
4,Handheld bug zapper,have not had the chance to use this item yet since I bought this as a back-up for the other one. looks ok at this time and hopefully works when the time comes.
4,Fruit fly killing machine,With some careful hunting this zapper removed a large colony of fruit flies. For very small bugs it may take a pass or two due to the spacing of the grid. Powerful enough to do the trick and a set of batteries lasts a long time.
4,"Cheaply made, but works great.","First the cons: it feels very cheap and the battery cover falls off unless taped on.Now the pros: It works. My girls love chasing flies with it. It was fairly inexpensive compared to nicer ones, so I have to give it four stars. If the battery cover would stay on, it would have five stars even though it feels cheap. After all, it does do exactly what it's suppose to."
1,Wrong item from picture,"Duped again by Amazon...saw the one in the picture, ordered, got another version in the box when it arrived. I don't need the thick triple screen that you have to wail on the flys to get them to zap, I loved by 5yr old zapper like the one that was in the picture that I only had to touch to them briefly and would cleanly take care of them."
5,Yellow Jackets Beware,"My Zapper is over 10 years old. I bought it from a convienence store during a jerky run on a campout. It will rid your tent or travel trailer of no-see-ums in a flash (kind of fun to use at night). Its also great against flys and mosquitoes.At times we're bothered by yellow jackets out on the patio, especially if grilling meat. The Zapper will down one of these pests in a flash. The first flash will stun and drop the beast and either a stomp or second zap will dispatch it. One zap is all thats needed for most other tiny critters. Battery life is at least one summer season and I've run mine for two years with no battery replacement. It's well made for a product of its type and I couldn't ask for better. Keep away from small children tho since it carries a charge for a half minute or so after shut off and that can give a bit of a sting!"
4,zaps fleas i hope.,"I've been using this on my two cats fur. I hear and see a lot of crackles and they tolerate me running the racket both against and with the fur direction but I don't see dead fleas so i don't know if this works properly. It pops in different spots, and even when i barely touch the fur sometimes (i assume the flea jumps into it) I'm really hoping I'm getting the fleas even though no carnage. Am I the only wannabe flea killer?"
2,Disappointment,"When I received the product, I found that inserting the batteries required that the handle be taken apart. My friends, who also purchased a bug zapper from Amazon, said they only needed to lift the cover of a battery compartment to change or insert batteries. My bug zapper is now functional - but the handle has been taped together so that contact is made and when the time comes to change the batteries - I dread the tricky task of keeping the two buttons that activate the electric power - in place while I remove and reinsert the tiny screws into the handle - A very antiquated design that should not have cost so much - Very disappointed with this purchase. If you are contemplating buying a bug zapper - be sure to inspect as much as possible the ease or in this case, difficulty of battery change."
5,Amazing,I am not sure what we did before this zapper it is amazing!!! We are able to quickly dispatch flies and any other flying creature that should not be in our house. Just yesterday we got a bee that kept circling our baby. The quality is not great and I am sure that after a year or so it will need to be replaced but what do you expect for the price. Overall we are very pleased and will always have one in the house.
2,Waste of money,"I bought this to replace one that I had a year ago. This was no where near what I thought it was going to be (Mainly my fault for not reading reviews and looking at pictures). The first thing I did not like with this product is that the net where you try to kill the bugs only goes side to side. I found lots of the bugs I swung at went thru the big gap between the wires. The second thing that I did not like was that in order to kill a bug, you had to press two buttons at the same time. Having to hold both buttons at the same time made it awkward to swing. The last and most important thing about this thing I did not like was it is cheaply made. The yellow plastic is hollow vs. being solid. I had been careful with it for a long time, until I was chasing a bee that flew on the wall. As soon as I hit the wall, the yellow plastic broke releasing the wires, making it useless.If you decide to buy this, be careful not to hit anything, because the cheap yellow plastic will break."
2,Does not attract flies.,"Yes, this can kill a fly, or more often it just injures and stuns them, then I step on the fly as it squirms on the floor.Occasionally it has come in handy and can sizzle a fly good, sparks flying.Once I held it over a big fly 1inch away, and the fly flew around it and escaped! It does NOT attract flies. Maybe Iowa flies are just too smart for this gadget!A toy, not a real good defense against late summer flies."
4,Flies be gone!,"We had such horrible flies this summer my husband decided to try this electronic swatter. It works great but there's still a little skill to getting the fly, well for me at least. I like it but my husband loves it! I think it's a man thing, but as long as the flies are dead I'm happy :)"
4,Works as advertised,"There is not much to say about this item other than it works great. I have only had experience with one other zapper which was purchased at a local Cabela's. This one is more powerful for about the same cost. I know, I touched them both. Yes, I like to test things accurately. This thing HURTS and kills bugs instantly.Understand that these types of zappers are NOT to be used like a typical fly swatter. They are weak plastic which will break if smashed onto a surface. They are designed to kill in mid air, which, if used properly, will work as advertised.My only complaint about this item is the lack of a constant-on switch. I realize why this has the switch designed like it is (safety), but I would prefer one that I could turn on, without regard to the position of my fingers. This is not a major problem, just my personal taste."
1,Terrible product,"this item broke the very next day after receiving it, the plastic is much too flimsy and very cheaply made!It also doesnt kill large flys it only stuns them! on small insects it may work but it broke before i had the opportunity to test that!I would not recommend this product to anyone or purchase it again!Waste of money!"
4,amazing and fun !,"this product works well, even though cheaply built.The insects explode with a pleasant 'bang' and it is so satisfying that one soon goes looking for more to kill..The battery cover is cheap and may get loose. I placed some duct tape over that to hold it in place.In terms of design I would prefer just a single switch (no doubt lawyers made them use two - you know, for safety) but one does get used to holding both to switch it on. One can also easily open the unit up and solder one switch closed.After being given one and find one at a yard sale I bought 6 more!"
4,Decent product,"I got this for my husband as a Father's Day gift, because his dad had one and loved it. It works, no doubt about it, but with this particular racket, bugs of a certain size just slip through. It's not a meshlike, grid-patterned racket, like the one my father-in-law has, and how I assumed this one was. The wires just go in one direction, across the racket, and have NO wires crossing them vertically. This means bugs just slip through the cracks. It works, most definitely, but many a smaller bug has just flown right through it."
1,The Bugs are Laughing at Me,"This bug zapper is awkward to use as the battery compartment cover continuously came off and flew across the room when I would try to swing at a fly. Flies are very speedy and when they know you are after them, they get faster. I thought this would be the perfect little gizmo to wack them as they flew across the room. Wasn't I surprised when I swung the Zapper and looked down to see only the handle left in my hand? It had literally come apart in my hands! I have never purchased anything less useful in my life!"
1,Don't buy this item,"Out of the box the packaging is amusing but that's where the good times end. There are two buttons that you press to activate the zapper, however my unit would only intermittently activate for a second or two at a time. Then it eventually just stopped working all together. New batteries didn't help. I think I got a total of 30 seconds of usage and it never stayed on long enough for me to even think about zapping a bug.Maybe I just got a defective unit, but the cheap plastic construction doesn't instill much confidence in the product as a whole."
1,Handle cracked and broke,"I had this for a little over a month and used it just a handful of times before the handle broke!! My husband was swinging at a fly and the black portion of the handle literally cracked, exposing wires inside and rendering it useless. The plastic is cheap to start with, but I really think this should have held up a little better than that. It's not worth trying to return so I just bought the iTouchless swatter and will see how that one works out - I hope it's better quality than this."
5,"Fantastic, and hilariously fun","I was stunned at the power that a pair of AA batteries provide. At this low price, I'm stocking up on them!"
3,Zapper screen is small in comparison to others on market,"Seems to do the job. One disappointment so far is that the zapper net is actually much smaller than other zapper swatters out there. But this is the only one we could find that doesn't have the protective layering hence it still works better than the others despite its smaller size. When some genius figures out that this design in a larger size is the way to go, it'll be a bestseller. But for now, we have this one."
1,Cheaply made,"I ordered this last Fall and used it just once - it worked. I put it away until this Spring and used it several times the other day. Today, the red light will only come on occasionally (pressing both buttons) and most of the time, nothing happens. I got this one to replace a different zapper I ordered from Amazon which didn't work at all. This thing is cheaply made and would not recommend it. I'm beginning to think they're all the same."
1,Just a WASTE of money and battery,"I'm really surprised by the previous reviews. I bought this one week a go and do NOTHING to bugs, you actualy have to ""kill"" the bug (mosquito, fly, etc) by TORTURING it, you will find yourself pressing the 2 buttons for as much as 10-20 seconds in order to kill the bug, if you just zap it for a few seconds you will only torture the bug, like giving it an electroshock and leaving it with epilepsy.. A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY."
1,Not Made to Last,"I used one of these on a camping trip last week, and it worked great for a few days. Then at one point the button broke, rendering it useless. My campmates and I took it apart, trying to McGuyver a solution, and discovered the thing is VERY CHEAPLY constructed -- i.e., not meant to last. We tried to fix it, to no avail. Total crappy fragile plastic parts. If you're willing to drop 12 bucks for the temporary thrill of electrocuting mosquitoes and then to drop the broken thing into landfill to exist for the next ten million years, be my guest; as for me, I'm spraying on a little DEET and using an old-fashioned fly-swatter."
3,I got zapped,"Although the product works, I was a bit disappointed with it. The intended insect victim must be sufficiently slow and unaware allowing you to position the zapper above it and make contact. I also found the product at the local walgreens for about $4 less than I paid at amazon."
5,AMAZING BUG ZAPPER,Just received my bug zapper yesterday. For someone who is fatally allergic to stings I wish I would of had this baby years ago!!! I will no longer be scared to go outside in fear anymore!!
3,So So Swatter,"Not overly happy with it. We had an attack of small fruit flies and the wires on this zapper are spaced just a little too widely to effectively zap them. About 60% of the time they fly right through it. Our previous zapper had wires running both directions and seemed more effective.Also, it has two buttons to press simultaneously which is a bit of a pain.I rate this one so-so and wish I would have tried a different one."
2,Hype too high,"My friend had a bug zapper and I thought this item would be comparable. Wrong! His item was purchased at a Harbor Freight store. It sells for $2.99 there. This item from Amazon is much inferior to the one from Harbor Freight Unfortunately, I didn't learn about the low cost of Harbor Freight until after I had bought this one. I was hoping that it was a better product, but that is not the case. Harbor Freight's Uses ""D"" batteries and the racket part is made of a mesh so that some small insects can't fly through it. The one from Amazon uses ""AA"" batteries so won't last as long on batteries. I made the mistake of buying the one on Amazon, so I will just mark it up as experience. Will make me check further on merchandise when I buy from Amazon."
2,Its a fun toy,"This is my second ""Raquet"" type fly swatter. This particular model has a serious flaw, in that it is missing the ""cross strings"" or cross wires of the raquet. This means that bugs easily slip between the wires when swatting them. The model I used to have had cross strings (like a real tennis raquet) so bugs can not escape swatting. This is fun to bring out in front of friends, but not so effective."
1,Simply a Waste,"An old badminton racquet is a better bug eliminator. If you enjoy the smell of frying insects that may accidentally fall on this thing, then this is for you. Otherwise save your money!"
1,UNSAFE! If I could give them zero stars I would!,"I don't own these but saw them at a flea market. No question in my mind why they were up for sale (but should have gone in the trash IMO!) My friend discovered -- the hard way! -- that these deliver a VERY unpleasant shock if touched to human skin! Mind you, this friend is a large manly guy, not easily affected, yet he howled and dropped it! So you can imagine the jolt of voltage that must have been involved here! I would not want my children in the same room with these devices, nor my father with his pacemaker, or even my pets to inadvertantly come in contact with the live zapper screen. What were they thinking!?!?!?"
3,Not as great as I had hoped,"The battery compartment lid is so tight that I can't even slide it onto the handle, so it remains off. I haven't liked the button option either. You need to hold the buttons while swinging. I tried just pushing the buttons once to charge it up and as I have swung to hit the bugs they're not being zapped at all because there's no charge. I still use it, I just have to hold the buttons in. That's not what I read about from other reviews. Oh well."
3,Does the job...IF you can hit a fly,"This bug zapper was a bit of a dissapointment. There are only horizontal wires so there is plenty of room for the flys to squeeze through. This proved to be pretty frustrating when some of the smaller ones would survive my mission! However, when you do get one, it definately does the job! I would recommend another model that has horizontal and vertical wires."
2,Save Your Money,This product sounded great but unless you are the Karate Kid it is near impossible to make contact with a buzzing fly. The only way I was able to kill one was by lowering the racket on it slowly and trapping them. Some would fly into the racket trying to get away. Bottom line is if you have a major fly problem this product is not what you need. Buy the disposable fly bags that you put water in. They really work!
3,Cheap,"Sort of fun. Cheap version. Good price. Better than meshy type of rackets where you have to pick dead bug out. These just ""fall off"". Not as easy as you might imagine."
5,Awesome,The bug literally dies upon touch and sticks to the paddle. I like to think it's a very humane way to go. Husband tested it and it definitely shocks.
2,Batteries Not Included,"Heads up - product description says (batteries included) but no such luck. There was one a bit cheaper but I chose this one because I thought it was a better deal with the batteries. Otherwise, sorry cant really rate this since havent used it yet."
2,Poor design and flimsy,"I bought this model and another more expensive model called the Executioner in the same shipment. Don't waste your money on this model -- it is flimsy and you need a screwdriver to open the battery compartment to undo the screws and bolts! The buttons fall out when you open the casing and it is rather cumbersone putting the buttons, screws, bolts back in after you change the batteries. Also, the surface area of this swatter is slightly smaller than the Executioner which costs $6 more--well worth it in my opinion. Both work well but the Executioner is easier to use, just push 1 instead of 2 buttons to use and the battery case pops out without the need for a screwdriver.Save your money -- purchase the executioner. I'm returning the amazing handheld bug zapper as it wasn't that ""amazing""."
3,Not the best,"I was a little disappointed with this bug zapper. The space between the metal wires is too large. Smaller bugs can fly through. I only get the loud zap occasionsly. I've actually had large flies that will fly into the zapper, receive one shock and fly back out. If I can catch them against a window I can trap them. I'm half squishing half zapping. They end up smoking, which smells pretty bad. It works if you can catch the bug against a solid object. I have not found it effective for zapping bugs mid flight."
2,Cheap or bad shipping by amazon?,"A friend has a similar one and it works great for getting those mosquitoes and biting flies and I bought one for around my firepit. It arrived broken: handle broken (easy fix with CA+ glue) and later found out the circuit board was crushed (not an easy fix with CA+ glue). AKA doesnt work/DOA. Its either cheap and it was shipped that way or it was from shipping where it shared a box with a 40lb bench grinder and 5 lb wheel (which were on a different order spaced out by several days but still packaged in the same box) Not sure if I want to deal with the hassel to return it or just buy a new one by itself. They are fun, and they do work when theyre not busted however! Order it by itself is all I can say at this time"
5,Great zapper!,"I took this to cabin for a weekend. It did a great job taking out over 30 flies with very little effort. It rarely kills outright, but it at least stuns very heavily allowing you to step on the fly to finish it off.It was a big hit with the other campers too.This was the second time at the campsite for me and it made this visit even more pleasant."
1,mr.s,this was one of the worst products i've ever bought from you guys. picture is completely distort. looked more like a child's toy and did not do a very good job. Actually it was almost completely ineffective. unfortunately my daughter put it away. out of site is out of mind and when i stumbled across it in the garage the other day i was angry with myself for not sending it back.
2,batteries not included,"having chosen this zapper to a lower-priced rival due to its purported inclusion of the required batteries, i was disappointed to open my package today and find none there. i'm stuck trying to decide which of my son's toys will have to suffer until i can purchase the needed double A's, while trying to convince him this is not a new racket for him to play with. bummed."
1,A simple Fly swatter works just as well and is better for the environment,I was hoping when I ordered the bug zapper I would get to zap more bugs but as it turns out the Zapper works no better than a regular $1 fly swatter. And here is my biggest beef with this product: It comes packaged in coated cardboard and covered in plastic. The Zapper itself is plastic and uses two batteries. So now I am having severe environmental guilt! Save your money and the environment and stick to the $1 fly swatter.
1,Was I an idiot for ordering?,What was I thiking? That a fly would sit still while I eltocuted it? Must have. what a dumb idea. Doesn't work - flies don't sit still! Buy a $1 flyswatrter and be 50 times better off!
3,Cheaply made but works,"This is very flimsy plastic zapper, but it actually works IF you can hit what you're swinging at. It's really short, much shorter than a tennis racket, so when fighting bees and wasps it's a little stressful, but it definitely shocks them. I wish a slightly more 'professional' version of this existed with a longer reach and better controls."
3,Does not come with batteries,"I purchased the item from amazon (not a 3rd party seller). The item description states that batteries are included. They are not. This racket has wire's that go across, but not up and down. I prefer a bug racket that has a grid on the outside - it allows mosquito's to get trapped easier."
4,Great White Bug Hunter,"These bug zappers are great and keep you from cleaning fly mush from the windows and walls! I prefer the ones with just one button to press since I don't have kids in the house, but that's easy enough to change with a little super glue on one of the buttons to hold it down. Don't buy the ""safe"" ones that have the two layer wires to keep you from zapping yourself. They don't zap the bugs very well either."
2,Not powerful enough!,"We owned one of these that worked great that was given to us a few years ago.....it finally broke, so we replaced it with this one. This one doesn't seem to even faze the flies; you swat at them, and the electric shock isn't enough to even stun them. Not worth the money. A disappointment."
1,Bummer!,I had purchased a similar type item on clearance last year and it was terrific (until it was broken by the boys playing with it!); so when bug season came this year I thought I'd get another - This one has its killing 'field' in the middle of an outer layer of wire mesh; so the bug --if you are looking to kill something large like a wasp (my intention) can't get thru the mesh to get zapped....All I managed to do was really tick off a wasp as I had it pinned up against the window! Ut-oh! There's another product out there this is strictly just one layer of electrified mesh- get that one...
2,It's OK but get the upgrade!,"The Executioner PRO Fly Swat is much better. Don't waste your money on this one. get the upgrade, you won't be sorry"
2,Oops,Wasn't what I thought it was going to do. It's nearly impossible to catch the flies. The only way to zap them is when they are in mid air flying and it's just too hard to get them. The rim is to wide to actually zap them when they are still. Wouldn't buy this product again.
4,Better Than Anything Else We've Tried to Combat Flies,It's actually harder than you think to smack a fly with this thing - my recommendation is to place it directly OVER the fly while it has landed - and then push both buttons - the fly will fly UP and into it. My husband makes quite the game out of it.
1,Only kills ONE bug!,"Worked great for ONE fly! Then it died. Tried new batteries, etc., everything. Called company for replacement since I was not happy with that level of quality. They promised a replacement. I called again 3 months later since no replacement had arrived. Another 3 month wait. Called company again. They had never heard of me or any replacement order. Not ordering THEIR products again!"
2,Cheap,"Cheap, cheap and cheap,as soon as you swing a bit harder it cracks, useless after that..They should use a bit more of a quality plastic, this one is to rigid and too breakable.."
3,Good Product ~ Works Well!,"I received one of these as a gift years ago and after nearly a decade of usage, it broke and I had to purchase a new one.I found this one on amazon.com and figured it would serve as a good replacement. The plastic is a bit flimsy in comparison to the one I had, in fact the handle keeps coming loose (could be dangerous if it does, especially around children, since it has a shock current running through the racket) ~ if re-designed with a higher grade of plastic, could be a great item!"
2,bug zapper just ok,"I actually find this product somewhat hard to use, you have to trap the fly and that's hard as they fly off before you can do this. save your money and use the old fashioned fly swatter, it works."
1,Good for the two days it worked.,This product is very cheaply made. I got two full days of use and now the flies are laughing at me. I have changed the batteries several times and it still does not work. Big disappointment.
2,Great but just dont drop it....,Was working real well until it was dropped (not hard) and it no longer works..... seems like it was very cheaply made.
2,very poorly made,"Ok this did work but was very cheaply made. The metal strands were not all bounded with the frame when it came. The metal strands never were put in correctly and some were not even long enough. The second problem was once you put two AA batteries in it the plastic door will not go back on. The battery compartment is to tight of a fit and the batteries have to go in at a slight angle causing the door not to fit (I did try AAA batteries and they were to small). The wire strands are spaced out to far to hit small flies, like fruit flies. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it did work on large flies and boring bees. I have no faith that this product will last more than maybe one season. Buy a different model made by someone else. Good luck!"
1,this a cheap plastic toy.....,I was fooled by the majority of good reviews for this product and ordered it. When it arrived I was quite surprised by it's tiny size. It looks like a toddler's cheap plastic toy. On top of everything it did not do anything when I installed batteries. The light comes on showing that it is powered up but nothing happens when a mosquito lands on the net. Very disappointed - needles to say it goes back to Amazon. It looks like a toy and it acts like one. I am buying a more reputable model.
1,poorest shipping ever,"The frame itself wasn't too bad for under $50. If you look closely at the pictures, the fancy metal looking pieces is all one pressed mold made entirely of gesso with a thin wood base.It came with barely enough bubble wrap to go around the short side once and the box was stuffed with a little bit construction paper. I'm amazed that more wasn't broken, but three of the corners were completely bare of gesso mold; cracks in the corners; and dents all over.I would not recommend simply based on the poor condition it arrived in."
2,Plaster of Paris?!,"Unfortunately, this frame's beauty is ephemeral. The outer frame is molded from a plaster-like material that flakes, leaving behind a huge, white chip. If you're handy with paint and putty, it's not a big deal. However, if you don't want to be Mr./Ms. Fix-it, then steer clear."
3,"Aids in writing a paper, but wake me up when it's over","A very thought provoking book, in which Nagel takes certain sections of the book and shines light on a new way of viewing the characters and plot. I still would rather read the dictionary."
3,The Sune Also Rises,"This book has to be taken in historical context to be understood and appreciated. First the setting took place in a very unique time. It was just after World War I and many young people were disillusioned with the human race. It also was a period of prohibition in much of the world. These situations combined created a magnetism for many creative types looking for an outlet and place to commune. The other significant idea which much be remembered as one reads the book is that this was the book that set a new style in literature. The sharp,quick narrative style was completely different than any American literature preceding it. This is indeed a somewhat rough read but keep in mind many years have passed in which this artistic style has been refined. If for nothing else read it for its historical portraition of post WWI Europe, and it artistic contribution to literature. Along the way you just might find a character or two you relate to, especially if you like wine. Cheers!"
2,"Love the band, not the CD","This was put out to hold the Bamboleo fans over till the next studio release, imo.I'm a huge Bamboleo fan, having seen them 7 times live, but this CD was a disappointment. The remix CD should have been omitted altogether. Extremeny boring.If you want to hear them at their best, get Yo No Hace Falta, their previous release."
3,too rap and disco oriented,"The record is interesting for a real Bamoleo fan like myself, eventhough I hate rap and generally am somewhat averse to disco. I let some of this slide on this one, but I am not sure others feel the same way. A tad on the commercial side."
3,Easy to listen to,"The songs on this CD are pretty hit-or-miss, resulting in a rather patchy release from a talented pop rock band.Chimera's sound is soft rock--melodic and layered--and makes for pleasant background music akin to bands such as The Cranberries and The Cardigans. The singer has a beautiful voice and each song features some great harmony; however, some of the songs just aren't as good as others. I feel that the CD really starts to drag toward the end, which is populated with relatively faceless songs that melt into each other, each about as good as the last (i.e. drab). Nevertheless, there are some fantastic compositions sprinkled throughout the first 3/4 of the CD such as ""Catch Me"" and ""Night Song.""Overall, a pleasant CD if you don't pay too much attention and just let it play."
3,"Short, concise, rather enjoyable","The prospect of encapsulating the first world war in to such a short volume might seem well nigh impossible, but Taylor does a pretty good job. His writing style is sometimes too choppy, but is always clear. He is apparently a towering figure in the field of history in England, though to be honest, it's a little difficult to tell that from this book. The best part of the work has to be the captions to the photos - they are at times outrageously funny."
2,Missing pictures and maps,"This ""illustrated history"" is missing two thirds of the illustrations on Kindle, including all the maps."
1,Mitsubishi Book,It's NOT really a how to book. Just look at these nice cars book. The book lacks techinal detail.I would not recommend this book at all.
5,These boys are driving chariots of power!!,"Baboon provides plenty of hum-along anthems with a tasty variety of crunchy guitars and quick tempo power. They appeared on Walker Texas Ranger! Isn't that enough? Buy this and understand that adrenaline and sausage make a tasty milkshake, direct from Dallas, Tx. Good songwriting, a great follow up and more fun is on the way. Guitarist Mike Rudnicki has been listening to Faust, Roxy Music, and the Beach Boys lately so watch out! Excellent sleeve art by Dallas comix artist T. Ramsell. CONSUME IT!"
3,To lil' stevie barnett,"If you think you've been made fun of and teased because of your political views you're either not very intelligent or just plain dishonest. The reality was you were a j*ck*ss, your reviews- conservative, left wing, whatever- were mean spirited, attacked other reviewers, showed you to be intimidated by anyone with an education (those dreaded pseudo in-TIE-lect-you-alls) and to have a short, rather immature temper.You got what you deserved, which was to have them plastered on discussion boards and ridiculed. It had nothing to do with conservative vs liberal, again, you're either not very bright or being very dishonest.The real test is that you pulled your reviews out of embarrassment. I CHALLENGE you to repost them- WITHOUT EDITING the nutty outbursts contained within. Won't do it will you? Your band sucks by the way..."
1,Whew,"One of the worst books I have ever stolen from a library. And now for some unknown reason, it's on one of my mother-in-law's bookshelves. I actually read this 7 day book, and then failed to return it. I hated it! It is about the evil owner of a baseball team named Gomer O. Dudley and his players and employees who revolt against him. Can you think of anything more ridiculous?"
2,Moderately interesting travel woes plus book-industry rants.,"From the paperback edition's cover you would expect this to be an amusing look at other people's travel horrors. The stories are OK, but I have seen better collections of such. The book is leavened by a rather outdated set of observations on the state of the book industry. I'm surprised that a 1998 book gives almost no attention to internet book retailing."
5,High quality kitchen device,This knife storage block met all of my expectations. It's solid and attractively constructed. Should last for a long time. It freed up a drawer for other utensils as well as providing a much safer place to keep sharp knives.
4,"Nice scissors! Average block, though.","I am satisfied with my purchase of this knife block; however, I am not overly impressed. The scissors are very nice, and the honing tool looks high-quality. The knife block itself is so-so; the workmanship could have been better, and I would prefer a steeper-angle design.Overall, I feel neutral about the block, but am adding one more star for the scissors and honing tool."
3,"Nice, but not quite what I hoped for.",Nicely built. Solid. Does everything it 'should' do.Personal preference is the issue.-I wish I could have found it in a dark stain vs. light.-I wish the steak knives were arranged left/right vs. top/bottom... that way the blades wouldn't cut into the block OR require that you put them in blade up.-I wish that the angle of the block was a little steeper. That way the block and the knife hands would be just a little further out of children's reach AND it would take up slightly less counter space.
5,Hello Wonderful,"Have no idea how I managed to do it, but I wrote the review below and must have clicked that I was under 13 or something, it doesn't show in my personal reviews and it says ""a kid's review"" which is still kind of hilarious to me. Anyhow, it won't let me remove it??? So yeah. Putting this here again, so that I can edit it, if need be:I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about unless this description has been changed.This product arrived to me EXACTLY as described. Suits my needs wonderfully, is attractive and useful and WHAT a value! The shears and honing rod alone are worth what we paid! I am so glad we ordered this. We're slowly building out Wusthof collection and this is so perfect for us!"
5,Great tool!,"A great tool and inexpensive. When I was researching various different power tools, I get an impression that Black & Decker products generally do not receive many good ratings. As an owner of this Jigsaw, however, I can confidently say that this is a great tool and is inexpensive for home diy."
5,Thank You Mr. T!,"Yes, I concur with the music fan from San Diego. Stanley Turrentine was one of the best players to ever pick up the instrument. He should have been heralded more, for he was a saxophone player's saxophonist: One of the few players out there, who you could immediately recognize after hearing just a few bars. There aren't many guys that you can say that about.This recording is just another example of the fine recordings this great artist produced during his illustrious career.For all you kids out there who want to learn how to play the saxophone, you couldn't find a better role model than Stanley, or a nicer man.But hey, the music never dies. The staff upon which we all play out our lives refrains...Thanks, and God bless you Mr. T!"
1,Richard Pombo can write?,"This book deserves only negative 5 stars but the scale does not go that low.If you decide to read this book be prepared to fact check every single sentence, because the publisher did not.Richard Pombo - unbelieveably he is a Congressman from California - is a well known liar. Multiple public articles have proved this beyond a shadow of a doubt - and he has been forced to publically admit to lying about much of what he has written in this book. He has never, ever challenged anyone who called him a liar. In fact Pombo proves that jokes often are based in truth: How do you know if a politican is lying? His lips are moving!So, in short, don't buy this book, instead, find it at a library (it is probably in the Fiction section). Buying it would only encourage this liar."
1,"Unbalanced, extremist ranting","Pombo obviously has no respect for the environment since he wasted numerous trees on this 225 pages of extremist nonsense. He revels in environmental ""scares stories"", some of which have since been proven to be false and most of which are grossly exaggerated. He never considers the alternate view, such as in what state would our environment be in if not for laws that protect it. Still spraying DDT? Even more extinctions? Clearcutting of national forests? Yosemite and Grand Canyon dammed up reservoirs?Only those readers who already agree with him would not see this as the ravings of an unbalanced anti-environmentalist lunatic. This is obviously written for the Rush Limbaugh/Ann Coultier crowd, who are not particularly interested in facts and balanced opinions, but only want confirmation of their extremist views."
4,very good game.,"Good game set in a very interesting setting, thee character art is very good and the music is as well.The game play is that of a RTS type of RPG and will take a while to get used to."
1,Worst RPG ever,"I can't believe I wasted 50 bucks on this piece of crap. The plot, what little there is, is laughable at best. Switching main characters all the time and then having characters you worked on die is just plain annoying. The story is linear, and the knacks and skill plates add nothing special to the game. The voice acting is horrible, and the graphics are average. I have been playing RPGs since my Super NES days and I would rather play Chrono Trigger or Breath of Fire than spend more than 5 minutes playing this game. I expect more from Atlus and the Growlanser franchise than this shoddy game. Even the limited edition extras weren't all that great. Does anyone collect lenticular cards anymore? The keychain I received was scratched. Overall, I would recommend something from the Disgaea series or the Shin Megami Tensei series. I kept playing this game trying to get my 50 dollars worth but gave up shortly after reaching the ""main"" story when I realized that it would never happen."
5,Consistent Output,"These cartridges produces real good and consistent color output. I tried other compatibles with my workflow and the color consistently shifts. But with Rhinotek, I never had any issues with my large print jobs. For the savings and quality, I will stick with Rhinotek instead of the monopolistic OEM brands."
5,This is one of the best books I read on this topic,"The book is very well written, very friendly and practical. Behavioural patterns are well explained one I had no difficulty applying different techniques. I think it is good for professionals as well."
5,Great Depression WorkBooks,This is among one of the best Depression WorkBooks out there. Not CBT but Action and Reaction Therapy
3,Workbook for rapid relief from depression,"A workbook (not especially well written) for and about overcoming depression by way of Behavioral Activation. This concept will annoy many ""professionals"" who believe that to overcome depression should involve taking medication and years of WORK (real therapy). For those who believe in a less complex way, this is it."
5,Great Book!,"I was so fortunate to find ""Apparitions of Modern Saints"" on Amazon. I am happy to have my own copy. This book was written in 2001 and is timeless in blessings."
5,Awakening Loving-kindness,"I love Pema's philosophy. This book just helped me to remember to practice spiritual practices in my daily life. She helps me to remember to soften my heart and not get triggered over situations, people, etc. that I have no control over."
5,An Every-day Awakening,"I always appreciate Pema's practical, honest, humble and humorous approach on anything she discusses. I have a few of her books and this one was just as effective. I am immediately able to implement the ideas she conveys."
2,For followers of politics and history only....,"Sheehy provides an historical and psychological profile of candidates for election, prior to the election (Al Gore, George Bush, Bob Dole, Ronald Reagan, etc.). It was probably more fascinating to read while the election was still in progress - but I'm amazed that an author would spend a year writing a book that would have such a limited shelf life. I read it years after the election took place, so it was a bit like being in the Twilight Zone - I knew how the story would end, but Sheehy didn't. Now that George Bush Jr. is running for election, those who believe ""like father, like son"" may find the chapter on Bush to be revealing. And, of course, Al Gore is still around. Otherwise, don't bother with this book unless you're intensely interested in knowing the psyches of presidents and presidential candidates - and be prepared to have less confidence in their abilities or even their normalcy."
5,Excellent,"Excellent for an inexpensive, little system. Looks good, too.Got this for the bedroom (20' x 22' with hardwood floors), mainly to listen to books on CD. Works well, sounds great. Great buy, thank you, Amazon!"
5,Great unit,"I got this system for my office and I absolutely love it. This is not a ""loud"" or base-heavy stereo, but it is perfect for one room usage. Very sleek and attractive."
2,Useless warranty,"The unit itself looks great, is unobtrusive, and sounded fine. The problem was the ""service"" available when the unit failed within the warranty period. The only available ""local"" option would have required taking time off work in order to make the approximately 45 min drive to the nearest authorized repair shop, in a small satellite town. (no weekend hours) It just wasn't worth it. Before you buy from Panasonic, check the situation for that particular item - it does vary. Panasonic has lost a customer with their support for this item."
5,Very good system from Panasonic,This Micro System from Panasonic is excellent. The sound is beautiful and all the features it has makes it a great CD player and Fm radio. I have it in my computer room and controlling it with the remote control across the room is great. Excellent price too from Amazon. I am very happy with this purchase. I highly recommend it.
5,The refurbs are an incredible bargain,"I paid $58 including shipping for this remarkable unit. Amazon (which really has been reliable) is now in the business of selling refurbs. If they still have them, grab it.For something this expensive and remarkably compact, the sound is great and the unit is beautiful--truly understated elegance. It has a variety of CD replay options and been completely reliable for me.I think this is a very good choice even if it were 20 or 30 dollars more."
3,It's ok for a tribute album,"I never really ever cared for buying tribute albums , but I only really bought this to hear NOFX's cover of ""Forming"" , but the rest of the CD has some pretty descent material , especially White Flag's cover of ""Manimal"" . It is descent , but I wouldn't really recommend unless you really like the Germs , or you like some of the band's on this."
1,F*CK this! I want the real germs!,"If I wanna hear covers, I'll go to see a concertbut doing covers of the greatest band in punk history? you just can't do that."
1,Nosey and slow.,"Was very nosy and slow, would have done best going to my local fry's and receiving more for my money. Which I did, I bought 2 DVD burners for $10 each and they are great. Gave this one away with a new PC build to the homeless shelter."
5,"A piece of Dayton, Ohio history you should own.","exactly what the headline says.You need to add the piece of Dayton, Ohio's rock history to your collection.Brutal and brilliant."
3,Very interesting,"This book was a really interesting depiction of male life in this creole neighborhoods. It was not an ""easy read"" for someone who is not in the field of anthropology, but if you can see through the wordiness of the pages, it is really an interesting story. Knowing that the author predominantly focuses on the role of men in society, he occassionally recognizes how the women and children of this society are effected by rampant alcoholism and unemployment. If you are looking for easy reading, this is NOT it! But if you are mildly interested in the role of males in the family in other countries you might want to check this one out!"
2,Disappointed,Thought this would be perfect but was really disapponted. Once you put the ribs in the racks they all lean into each other and the middle ones don't get done.
2,Whiny child+great music= 2 stars,"I'm sorry. The music's kick-ass, no doubt, but the lead singer sounds like a retarded trust fund brat. Doesn't matter how good the lyrics are when it's coming out of THAT mouth."
5,You don't have to be a pulp fan to enjoy this novel...,"Paul Malmont's novel, The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril, has an inventive, fast paced plot with well developed characters, many of whom are drawn from the ranks of actual pulp writers of the 1930s such as Walter B. Gison (The Shadow), Lester B. Dent (Doc Savage), H. P. Lovercraft and L. Ron Hubbard. If you're a fan of the pulps, as I am, this adds a whole other dimension of fun to the novel, but the story and action stand on their own merits. If you're not familiar with the pulps of the 30s and 40s, then this entertaining novel will give you an painless introduction to an important, but often overlooked, part of our literary history. Highly recommended."
3,chinatown death cloud review,"It was ""ok"" but not so easy to read. Too much skipping around and sometimes I lost interest."
1,Fails My Test,"When I start a book, I give it 100 pages to really capture me. This book failed to interest me and I closed it for good at page 100."
2,"I wanted to love this book, but it is hard to follow.","I really would have liked to love this book, but it has become the greatest sleep aid ever. I am not sure how long it will take me to get through it! The story is all over the place and really doesn't make a lick of sense so far. IT has some interesting info on the real pulp writers like GIbson and the creation of the Shadow, but other than that, this is a book that puts me to sleep before I can even finish one chapter each night. Usually I could read a book of this size in a week- two weeks at most.I am not sure what the point of the story is."
2,"Average writing, average story","I rarely give up on a book, but I had to put this one aside with about 75 pages left. The story and the writing were simply average."
2,Too Jokey,"An art-less Kavalier & Klay-style take on the masters of Pulp. Good detail, but too many wisecracks that fall flat. The best part of the book is the villian's backstory which is played straight. And it's hard to root for the character of Kenneth Robeson as the Doc Savage books I recall reading had dreadful racial problems."
4,Not What I Was Expecting,"I heard about this novel froma friend and found the premise intriguing. It is about two pulp writers (Lester Dent and Walter Gibson, the authors of Doc Savage and The Shadow respectively) who go the the funeral of H P Lovecraft and find mysterious circumstances regarding Lovecrafts' death. It took a little bit to get into the story but once it took off, it became very much like reading a pulp novel. There are a few surprises in it and it could be the start of a new series of novels? I would recommend this to readers who are familiar with the names mentioned."
5,A wonderful story,"Mr. Malmont has written a wonderful, gripping tale that takes a hold of you from the very first page. I couldn't put the book down because i had to know what happened next. A solid plot, great dialogue, and a wonderful sense of being transported back in time, something that a Sherlock Holmes book would provide. I highly recommed this book..."
2,Weak,Malmont tries too hard here and the result is an uneven work that doesn't succeed either as traditional fiction or pulp. The result is an odd book that isn't very memorable.
3,Not bad,"Not bad as a short biography of the Prophet Muhammad if you wish to read from a Muslim point of view (although with little regarding his miracles etc) That is, if you dont want to read say Watts biography and find Lings a little too long to read.One point though, in the authors history he seems to think the civilization of Egypt was created by Arabs migrating there and mixing with the local population (Yeh right) Think he overdosed on the old Arab nationalism there. Hope for his sake that rather embarassing little gem has been removed."
4,Outstanding release,"Outstanding playing and recorded sound throughout! With its budget price, you should purchase immediately..."
2,Comes up short,"This book is a nice photo collection of railyards with lots of statistics and directions on getting to the yards. Unfortunately, there is no theory of operation about how the yards actually operate. Terms like 'pullout', 'drawbacks', 'trim', 'Dowty retarders', 'transfer yard' are introduced but never explained. The maps are nice -- even fascinating -- but cry out for explanation and elaboration."
3,Lack of definitions of terms.,"Many terms used throughout the book were not explained. Some examples; retarder, hump or bump yard, clasification yard, etc. Sure, some assumptions can be made as to the meaning of these terms, but it would have added to my enjoyment if these and some other terms had been defined and explained. Maybe for the experienced reader this wasn't necessary but as a novice I would have greatly appreciated this addition."
4,Excellent Book,This book is excellent if you want information about railyards. I must for any railroad based person.
2,Close but no cigar,"North Am,erican Railyards starts out withg great promise but fails to deliver. If all you want is one, maybe two photos of railyards this is your book. For those interested in railroad history and operation pass this up. The book is typical of what is being published (in China by the way) today. All photos and a lack of copy to support the subject. I wish I had read a review before I made the purchase. It was a waste of money."
5,Rockin the yards!,A well researched and organized volume. Great to see some of the legendary locations of the steel highways.
4,farm yard fun,Oh NO! There is a wild animal loose on the farm! The animals think it might be a coyote but they can't tell because it's covered in leaves! What ever it is they all try and run away from it. In the end the animal catches up with the gang and she's really only a playful rabbit looking for a friend!The books illustrations were neat. I read this to my 1 year old sister and they kept her attention well.I would recommend this book to be read aloud to preschoolers and younger. They will enjoy the surprise ending!
2,A catchy title but not much substance,I was attracted by the title and the cartoons but actually there is almost nothing to help you in there.
3,"Dark Photos, But Not Much Else on This Plane","I agree with the other reviews that the photos are rather dark and it's hard to pick out the details. Other photos, where the contrast is better, are fuzzy so, again, anyone interested in building a model might have to use their imagination. However, it's apparent that the wartime pics of the ""Flying Clog"" are generally a dreary lot, so this is about the best that could be done. I do think that there could have been more artistic renderings given the problems with the photographic coverage. The line drawings in the book are pretty basic and small. It would be nice to see a cutaway schematic. But that said, there are a few rare interior shots and the photos from the dorsal open machine gunner position are useful. I haven't seen the Squadron/Signal booklet but hopefully that will be a good supplement."
1,Chicken Lovers Dream,"This cookbook is only useful if you live on an above average income and love chicken. Eighty percent of the dinner recipes are chicken, most of the rest are salads or some variation of noodles. The portions are all divided into two person sizes, however there is nothing to help you buy only what you need to prepare a meal for two without left over rations. In short, this cookbook is completely useless for anyone closely resembling a newly-wed couple on a tight budget who happen to not love chicken. Now I'm off to find a cookbook I can hopefully actually use. Very disappointing..."
1,Not one of the better Betty Crocker's cookbooks.,"Of the several Betty Crocker's cookbooks that I have tried, this one lacks in presentation (pictures bunched in the middle of the book) and in flavor"
3,Funny Light Hearted Book,"Great funny read. I was expecting more hard useful mountain biking information. Would be a great book for a gift to a mountain biker.The book is a collection of very funny cartoons on biking, most just funny and some with serious advice."
4,A nice idea generator,"Goldman's book contains a lot of interesting trip suggestions. Sure, anyone doing much climbing in the Cascades should own Beckey. I also recommend Jeff Smoot's ""Climbing Washington's Mountains"". And if you can get it, snag a copy of Dallas Kloke's ""One Day Winter Climbs In The Cascades"". But this book also has a place in the library of a scrambler.My main objection is the limitation Goldman seems to place on her trips. The hardest climbs are just a little too easy. She would really open things up to another great 50 climbs if she were willing to go just a little bit farther into the Class 3 climbing arena."
2,Try Fred Beckey instead.,You're much better off buying the Beckey books on which most of these route descriptions seem to be based. Also a lot of the GPS coordinates don't match up against maps.
5,Systematic Genocide Brought To Light,"this amazing book starts off by first defining the rules of genocide as written up as a global pact which took the US 50 years to ratify, at which point, they continued to find various loopholes and excuses to negate the pact, much like they do now with the geneva conventions, and kyoto clean air act. the us was slaughtering native americans even while condemning nazi germany of similar acts abroad. after read numerous essays and books from churchill, the parallel between us and german tactics is very evident. anyone who is a humanitarian will take these passionate accounts by mr churchill to heart to realize that systematic genocide goes well beyond mass murders (they have already done that in years past, the times are calling for a modernistic approach to genocide...i.e. sterilization of females, assimilating of indigenious 'nations')."
4,A classic,"This is a casual, no fuss, no pressure, no artistic pretensions approach to creating a scrapbook. The book was published in 2002, so styles have changed and more tools and embellishments have been introduced. Some might find the book a bit dated and, in a way it is. But in other ways, the simplicity of the design and the elements serves to illustrate the underlying principles behind creating a good scrapbook page. The photographs and the story they tell are the focus and the reason for scrapbooking in the first place and the author demonstrates this in every layout. Some books tend to use the photos to complement the embellishments, not the other way around. Any of these pages can be updated and embellished with more modern looks and products once the basis for the design has been set."
2,Not worth the time to buy,Used this as a second battery when my OEM battery started to have charge retention issues. This battery only lasted maybe 30 charges before it was toast. No life to the item.
4,Not as good as the real thing,Years later I am still using this battery in my Minolta Dimage X (a great little camera). But its charge doesn't last as good as the original Minolta battery.
2,Not so great,"The idea is good, it just needs a little more work. The chimney doesn't have enough air vents to draw oxygen, so loading it to the top just doesn't work. It is also very difficult to keep the fire going. It usually takes several re-lights just to start a few briquettes. It does work decently for about 5 briquettes or so. If you're roasting marshmellows, this is the way to go, but if you actually want someting that works, keep looking."
1,You gotta be kidding me...,"Amazon used to offer the Weber Charcoal Chimney at the same price. The Weber Charcoal Starter is 1000% better than this product. I had one of these and once when dumping the coals the upper rivet (yes rivet) came lose and the hot coals spilled out. Could have been a disaster.Amazon no longer carries the Weber Charcoal Chimney; they list it as discontinued. Weber still makes their chimney and if you saw both of them side by side, there's no comparison. Weber is larger, sturdier, and safer.Lobby Amazon to carry the Weber again, or do yourself a favor and search Google for the Weber. It retails at 19.99 even if you have to pay full price. Well worth it."
1,good idea. bad execution,chimneys starters are a good way to go but like some of the other reviewer's mine popped a rivet and rusted. The Weber isfar superior.
5,Durable and big,"This is durable. Don't just buy one of these in the grocery store. The quality doesn't compare. The heat shield also protects the handle from getting too hot. You can use this item without lighter fluid. Just crinkle a sheet of newspaper in the bottom and voila! I have also seen some place this right on the camp stove to give the coals a quick start. If you do, be careful as they get VERY hot!"
3,"Great Product, Not So Great Price","When I got my Nerf Longshot, I knew I would need more ammo for the wonderful gun, so I stopped by the local Target and got this for $5. These wourk perfectly well but I suggest getting them somewhere else for cheaper!"
3,bullets over Baghdad,The bullets seem to get jammed in the weapon. I wouldn't say this is the ammo or the weapons fault. The problem is improper loading of ammo in cartridge. The second problem is loading the cartridge in the weapon. Place special emphasis on practicing the correct way to load the ammo in cartridge. It should save you many broken bullets. Ammo should be loaded to the rear of the cartridge and never overloaded. Good luck!
4,Nerf Ammo,These darts are great for the Nerf longshot and recon they last for about a month if you treat them well.a good price if you get them from target (4.99) they are not worth anything more then that though.
2,These darts are flimsy,"They are not durable at all. They're pretty cool at first, but after they've been used a few times (for me it was the 1st day), they stop working well in that they don't shoot true and jam your gun quite often. I've used other darts with other guns and they last a lot longer."
4,absolutely terrible price...,when i saw the price on these I assumed it was a third party seller trying to make an extra buck. Why would Amazon charge triple price for something like this? makes no sense...
4,A watch not for seniors,"Prompt shipping during holiday rush. But, the online item image appears to be large and item description is not clear about the size. I was totally surprised by its small size when it arrived and found it hard to read the time."
4,Addendum to my first review,"Forgot to mention one very cool thing about this book: the addition of top 10 fave albums list from many, many famous metal and rock dudes. Gives a cool look into the minds of the guys creating all this din.Also I like how Popoff shows the amount of votes each album got (well, somehow, in some convoluted mathematical way that we'll never understand); there's a lot of ties in there and it's interesting to see by how big of a margin the books beat each other. Man, the nerd-dom never stops.One negative: we gotta stop calling Pearl Jam metal. Really."
1,Top 500? Hardly.,"I bought the book because his metal encyclopedia was so rich and fascinating. But this one is dross. These top 500 were NOT EVEN PICKED BY HIM. The selections are from a poll he conducted. And all it has are the same old tired entries you'd expect. (Just about every Sab album, etc) Waste of money."
5,Arguably the most influential punk album ever.,"In terms of bands who are still inspiring legions of kids to sound just like them a decade later, OpIvy is unparalleled. It's difficult to convey just how influential this album has been. To hear it for the first time is to hear what ""punk rock"" is at it's core: Fast, loud, opinionated and fun. If you don't love this, you have no business calling yourself a punk. 30 years from now, this album will be counted with Sgt. Pepper as a milestone. Unconditionally Recommended."
5,its great,if your just starting to get into punk/ska this is a must have...operation ivy are one of if not the most well known ska bands known to punks...so if you like them or want to try something new get it... jacob
4,"This is good, but not great.","This Album is really cool, it has a lot good songs to sing along to, but alot of the songs are alike, and it gets old fast. Its worth getting."
5,This CD changed my outlook on life,"I am a high-school aged kid, and all my school years I have been concerned only with fitting in and being accepted by others. There is a punk kid in most of my classes, and he introduced me to Rancid. I bought Out Come the Wolves, and decided I liked punkish music. I then linked Rancid to Operation Ivy, and bought this. I then decided I was a punk.While I have never been oppressed by a police officer, or lived in a big city, I feel the same anguish with the government as Operation felt almost ten years ago.The lyrics on this CD are so profound, I have never heard lyrics as relevant and honest as these.To top it off, there are many songs on this CD that are quite catchy, without even the slightest hint of pop music.This CD is nothing short of remarkable."
5,THE BEST,this is the only cd that i own that i can listen to the whole way through. it is definatley worth it.
5,Changed everything,"When people see this album at stores they imagine four, random teenages / early twenties kids picking up instruments and jamming. This is true.However, they don't realize how those four young men also changed the way people would view punk rock and ska for ever. Sure, there was hardcore / ska political music before this. But most if it was so incredibly hard to listen to, that no one would. These guys are talented at everything they do. Decent guitar riffs, GREAT lyrics and melodies. Pick up this CD. Unless your a skinhead like someone else said, you'll really enjoy it and i think it will open you up to some more great albums. ENjoy !"
5,Great Album,"If you like punky-type ska influenced music, get this album. Its gritty enough to satisfy true punk joneses, but also light enough for the dance hall kids....id spend more time on this review, but i have to go listen to my operation ivy cd"
3,"Lyrics good, music quality bad.","This is an amazing record, indeed. I was primarily touched by the lyrics behind the music. They bring about social consciousness and awareness. I like that it makes you think and question what is happening in society. The lyrics still hold true for today. The music is also just plain fun to dance around to! The sound quality is less than to be desired though. But what can I say, it's an old record. Hee-hee! --Kelly Magovern"
5,Incredible Music,"Operation Ivy has to be one of the greatest bands to ever record music. Energy is the perfect word to describe this album. Operation Ivy's songs are aggresive yet peaceful, with an intelligence that seperates them from all other punk rock bands. Not only is this album the birth of skacore, it remains the greatest of the genre. Jesse, Tim (Lint), and Matt have gone on to make other amazing records. Check out Rancid and Common Rider."
4,I changed my mind,"I was originally the only person who gave this album 1 Star, but I gave it a second chance and it started to grow on me. Definately something to be treasured. It's the only ska sounding album I own. They have to be one of the most cultivated bands in the history of music.This was my original post:This album features probably the worst guitar tone I have ever heard. (presented by Tim ""Lint"" Armstrong of Rancid fame.) This album is very politically driven and has some good notions, but for the most part gets tiring. The singer sounds terrible even for a punk band. Well if your into bad musicians and poor audio quality pick this baby up. If not, don't make the same mistake I did."
5,Operation Ivy- Punk icon,"Thia is truy an inspirational album, one of my personal favorites, its what got me started on the punk scene. It's 27 tracks of raw energy, amazing lyrics and it makes you wanna skank for hours after listenin to it. Operation Ivy started influenced many bands today with their unique ska punk sound. This is the type of album you can listen to all the way through, each song is as good as the next. If you're a Rancid fan then definately pick this up. It's Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman like you've never heard them before. Its a definate 5 outta 5, it compares to the ramones, the misfits, the clash, NOFX, any of the greatest punk bands."
5,best punk band ever... y did they break up,first of all ne1 who rated this album poorly has a hearing problem this is 1 of the best punk albums ive ever heard... they have alot of tallent and this album itslef was rated the 48th nest album in Calioperation ivy is a punk legend and always will be rememnered that way at least by me
5,Who doesn't love Operation Ivy?,"Much isn't needed to get to the point of a review on this album. Plain and simple, this cd is one of THE greatest albums of all time. And even though they're not around anymore, RANCID is!! Rancid is another great band with great cd's. If you love punk/ska, you must get this cd. If you don't, you're missing out on an absolutely fabulous cd, and you suck. So unless you suck, buy this cd. For your sake."
4,Leaves me very satisfied,"This cd is a good buy for a punk fan of any kind. It reminds me of Sum41 and Rancid. The songs I like most are Soundsystem, Caution, Bad Town, Jaded, and Bombshell. Operation Ivy has a cool sound that is different then some other punk bands. Its sounds like a fusion of reggae, sca, and old school punk. One song I thought was over the top was Knowledge. It was like throwing out the cool sca, reggaeish, punk sound and bringing in the hardcore death metal sound (I like Green Day's calmer version better)."
5,One of the best ska/punk bands ever,"This is in my book the only punk band that can pull of ska tracks and not make them sound poppy ( ie Less Than Jake , Goldfinger ). The music is extremely intense and angry. The lyrics speak of the disllusionment in the punk rock scenes and the violence that surrounds them at shows or in every day life.I don't even care for alot of ska , but this music is intense and loud without the poppy horns and what not. The opening track ""Knowledge"" has to be the best one on here , also ""Jaded"" , ""The Crowd"" , ""Vulnerbility"" , ""Hoboken"" , and ""Sleep Long"" are all my favorites. It's also great to hear the members of Rancid ( Tim & Matt ) in their early years."
5,This truly is the best album ever. Period.,"You cannot beat this album. IT is to perfect. Knowledge must be the best song to start an album i've ever heard. IT may be the best on the album. Lint is an awsome guitarst, who makes songs like bad town really shine. Matt is one of the best bassists i've ever heard. Jessie has an incredible voice, and the lyrics may be the best i've ever heard. Dave is a awsome drummer, who puts an interesting beat into everything. The best songs are Knowledge, Sound system, Jaded, take warning, unity, bad town, gonna find you, caution, and yellin in my ear. That may sound like alot, and it is, but there are 27 tracks. Yeah 27 tracks of punk nirvana."
5,This CD changed my life.,"Buy this CD. Buy it now, whether or not you're a fan of punk or ska--Operation Ivy simply defies classification. I stumbled onto this group by accident about a year ago and the experience has revolutionized my CD rack. I can only assume that all of the reviews are this glowing, but speaking as someone who NEVER owned a punk album before buying this one, I can legitimately urge you to purchase this one as soon as possible."
4,"Ska? No, punk.","Whew. Op Ivy is something. Look, they may have started the whole ska thing, but I consider them a punk band. And a very good one at that. Explicitly political, which is good, like my fav band Dead Kennedys. The best (and most political) of these songs is Freeze Up. Great guitar and bass. Also good are...well, every song 1-19. Nothing good after that. Have fun!"
2,more ska than punk,"If you like stuff like Green Day, blink 182, Descendents, then you won't like this. This is mostly ska with some weak punk thrown in. I bought it on the basis of the reviews here and the band's semi-legendary status, and was greatly disappointed. Buy it if you like No Doubt or the weaker ska-type bands. Pales in comparison to true punk classics like Black Flag's ""Damaged""."
2,Dont be fooled by title of this album.,"Before I bought this disc I kept reading how great and influential this band was. When I got this disc I was thoroughly disappointed. Op-Ivy play fast, however, there is no heart; no energy. The songs are boring and the music has few hooks. When you've heard one Operation Ivy reggae style song you've heard them all. In addition, this album is way too long therefore it deludes the few good songs. I've tried but this album just can't grow on me. Best songs: ""The Crowd"" ""Unity"" and ""Healthy Body"""
1,Oh Please.,"This music is stupid just like the people who listen to it. Gimme a break and buy some good Christian gossip rock. JUST KIDDING. I like this cd. It's my band and I don't want anyone else to buy it, so go buy something else. I don't want this band to go mainstream! Thank You, thank you very much."
5,I Love This CD,"This is a really good CD, and I listen to it a lot. If you like Rancid, or any punk you should get this. It is not one of the best CDs I own, but it is very good. Definitely worth the money."
5,"A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAN OF MUSIC, PUNK OR NON!!","OPERATION IVY is one of the best punk bands of all time. They're creative songwriting ability (a mix of traditional punk and pop-ska) and beautifully constructed lyrics make this one of the most enjoyable albums of all time. The only reason you haven't heard of them is because they never made it as far as MTV (thank god!!) If they had, you could have seen this on top of almost every ""Top 100 albums/bands/alternative bands"" list available. They are a classic for ANY music fan. Get this one TODAY!"
4,Important though incomplete analysis of the Book of Abraham,"John Gee's short tome on the Book of Abraham is a must in any LDS library, as it gives, albeit, a short description of the issues at hand, such as the Book of Breathings, the facsimiles, and so forth.The only short-coming of the book is that Gee could have gone into much greater detail, such as a more detailed discussion of the issues of the facsimiles such critics as Thompson, the Tanners and Larson have raied in their articles and books.Notwithstanding, this is the place to start to get an idea of the evidences and criticisms of the Book of Abraham."
1,"overpriced, poor quality","Within a few weeks of using this, it broke. The gears are plastic and simply cannot stand up to reeling in a 100 ft hose across a flat yard. When rewinding the hose, the plastic teeth sheered off of the gear wheel.I'm sending mine back, not for a replacement, but for a refund. Considering this product commands a premium price, the quality of the product is significantly poor."
4,A perfect solution for managing your hose!,"I had read about this No Crank Hose system in the Wall Street Journal and it sounded too good to be true. We have a small deck that leads to our garden and when the hose was coiled up, it seemed to take up huge amounts of space. We we tripping over it and it didn't look very attractive, not to mention, it was a pain to coil up everytime we used it. I had seen the No Crank Country 100' system at my local nursery for 270.00!!! and thought that was really unreasonable. Came home did a google search, saw it on Amazon for 169.00, shipping included!!! The only problem I had was leakage from the faucet and the place on the No Crank where my hose connected. I resolved that simply by putting washers in both connections and it works perfectly now! Make sure that the end of the hose doesn't get caught on anything when you are reeling it in--the hydraulic power is very strong and could rip your machine off the hinges!!"
2,Not a good cpu for gamers....or anybody else for that matter.,"If you are a pc gamer then you should not get this cpu.This thing came with my new pc and i have made many upgrades to my computer but the cpu was the latest one.No matter how many ultra powerful parts i put in my new pc i noticed there was still major slowdown in a lot of games,well i found out that this cpu was to blame.You get what you pay for with this processor and thats a single core running at 3.3Ghz,533Mhz front side bus,and a low memory Cache.Also i noticed that this cpu heats up very quickly and thats just in idle mode!If you are not a pc gamer and are looking for a low priced cpu that will let you do word documents with no problem then you should get this,but if you intend to multitask then stay away from this one."
5,GREAT!!! EDUCATIONAL!!! MEZMERIZING!!1,"I bought this for my 2 year old Grandson (whom I babysit) and he watches it everyday. He has favorite parts of each one, the cow poop scene on ""The Farm Tractors"" selection, blowing up the rocks on ""Building a House"", and scraping up the pavement on ""Building a Road"". Each day it's something different, depending on his mood, but we always watch the ""tractor show"". It is educational, I learned alot (and I have a college degree)! I think it would be too boring without the music and he loves the guys and imitates their waves. He knows Rusty's and George's waves and will ask you how they wave....you'd better get them right! I would highly recommend this DVD. Believe it or not, it is very calming, and keeps their attention for a long time. A good thing to put on while you are trying to make supper."
1,DVD purchase,I was charged for this item and it was never sent. I emailed the seller to no avail. I had to file a complaint to get the seller to respond and allow me to recover my money. A full month passed before I could process the complaint as the delivery time was so broad that I had to wait a month. I would have liked an email just indicating that the item was no longer available so I didn't have to wait a month to purchase another one. I was not happy with this transaction.
1,Big disappointment,"This dvd was a big disappointment. I was hoping for a bit more of excitement for my son, but he wouldn't stay in front of the tv.He was completely bored. The key to childrens videos is to keep them entertained and interested. This clearly was not the case for this dvd.Its says the same thing over and over again, and really teaches your child nothing.Don't waste your money, or your kids time."
2,This CD Could Be Better,"The first half of the music from the first album,""This Diamond Ring"",is good sounding music.The Second half of the music,from'A Session With Gary Lewis..."", is in mono and is not good. There is a CD, with the two same albums as this CD, but was released in 1999, has much better sound for the second half as well as the first half of the songs and there is two extra tracks as well, as where this CD does not include the two bonus tracks.That is why I only rate this CD two Stars."
5,Good Tool for Learning Blues Scales and Technique,"I bought this book to learn the technique used in rock. Peter Gelling takes you through the 5 patterns, shows the relationship of each pattern to a chord rather than pattern 1 through 5, and teaches you a song in each pattern. He also presents some mixing of the patterns. The techniques hammers, pull-offs, slides, bends, etc. are all covered. He likes to incorporate blues licks in his songs from the old blues masters. I ran into a few of these licks while learning some of my favorite guitar solos."
4,its rockin,"wow, pow it's a good book. This book will help you with the blues lead guitar method.It goes pop.. it goes pow... it goes wow wow wow."
2,Good idea but no dice...,"These are a very good idea but they are way too thick to get between your teeth - I could only use them as ""toothpicks"". If they slimed them down they would be great as they have textured sides - but again, WAY too thick to be used as intended unless you have wide gaps between your teeth."
4,The best toothpick ever,If you really want to get in between your teeth these are the toothpicks for you and they do not break like wooden toothpicks. Great for your gums as well.
2,Brushpicks,"The brushpicks are a nice concept,but,after using one for 3 or 4 teeth, the pick would bend rendering it useless.Needless to say, I am very disappointed.Lois Fisher"
2,"Good sound, poor reliability","I've owned the AVR-645 for a couple of years now. Like others here, I got mine as a replacement for my dead DPR 2005. The 645 worked quite well for the first year. Then all of a sudden the remote stopped working. Unfortunately, it wasn't the remote. The IR receiver inside the unit was faulty. I found a work around by smashing the top of the receiver with a large hammer. This usually allowed the remote to function for at least a few minutes. Unfortunately this no longer works...Aside from that issue the only other complaint is that the thing locks up / freezes occasionally. I have owned many other brands of receivers - sony, yamaha, pioneer, technics, teac and none have had the quality control issues of the H/K. It does sound good though."
3,Amazon good Sony camcorder fair,I bought the Sony camcorder last month to take on a tour to Japan. The shipping was fast and free. Fortunately I tested it before going on tour. I tried to follow the instructions for loading the software on to my HP computer I bought about 18 months ago. I could not get my computer to burn a DVD of my test recording. I tried 5 times using different methods and gave up. I was able to view my test video on my computer but the video and sound were not in sink. I paid for a new camcorder but the box I received had been opened. That would have been OK if I could have gotten everything to work right. The tech guy at HP said he could get my PC to burn the CD if I paid $100. Since I was not sure I could get eveything to work right I sent the camcorder back to Amazon. They promptly refunded my money. I will continue to buy from them.
2,Don't record in HD,"My husband and I purchased this camcorder back in October, and found it to be a great little camcorder. We recently went on vacation, and got the idea to try recording in HD for the first time. We were able to play back the video ONCE by plugging into an HD TV. After that, we have been unable to retrieve ANY of our HD videos!! We can not even use the playback feature on the camcorder ... hours of video, now useless.I really wish that we had done some more research before purchasing this. After many frustrating hours doing research, and downloading software, we have come to learn that the software for HD pretty much doesn't exist ... thus making the HD feature an expensive, yet useless ""perk"". Stay away from ANY Sony HD camera until more software becomes available."
4,hd sony camera,This particular camera has a great picture and takes great pictures as well. The only thing i didnt like was the ability to record in one format only. The controls are easy to figure out in my opinion.
4,worth the price!,"its a good product with good enough memory and worth every bit what i paid for it, around 700 bucks."
3,Worth $20.00,"I started out excited about this book, then quickly realized much of what the author had to say was outdated at best, not the best advice on numerous occasions, but yet the book contained some valuable information. A bit stoneage as far as business marketing practices. One hundred pages on setting up your own studio/small business with personnel (No, thank you). If working as a freelancer in the graphics or copy arenas is your thing, its worth paying $20.00 to get something out of it."
4,Very surprising,Synth-based futuristic hip-hop from the West Coast. This album has a bit of an Antipop Consortium vibe. Pick it up while the price is right.
4,Worked for my project but...,There are 75 of them but they are tiny. Be nice if the measurements were included so I would have known to buy more.
1,PRODUCT DOES NOT MATCH IMAGE SHOWN,Product ordered does not match the product image shown during the ordering process. Misleading! Now don't have time to return/exchange.
3,half the songs are good,I became familiar with Chris Thomas King through O Brother Where Art Thou. I saw the O Brother tour and thought Chris was very talented so I purchased this CD and although it is not a bad CD I really only like half the songs and would not recomend buying this CD. I will look into purchasing another CD by him because I feel he is very talented as from when I saw him and some of the songs on this cd.
1,cheaters,"the hero cheated on his fiance and had no remorse about it. he got out of the marriage five years ago and did not look for the heroine. he was not pining for her. i liked the heroine. she was strong. she loved the hero but she dated other men. the hero did not love the heroine, he was in lust with her."
2,"Made well, but the headband is for large heads.","These earmuffs are made well, but even when adjusted to the smallest size, the headband is too large. This style is definitely made for large heads. Maybe it's better suited for men than women?"
4,An interesting look at the 1964 season and more,"I thought this book was going to be just a day-by-day recap of the 1964 Phillies famous skid at the end of the season to give the NL pennant to the Cardinals, but it was much more.Kasthaus does a good job of capturing the racial tensions of the time and he does give the Phillies management of the time a chance to respond to allegations of racism within the organization.Ultimately, it is a book more about the relationship of Dick Allen with the city of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia press. Stan Hochman, who receives some severe criticism in the book, is not well-portrayed in this book, nor is Larry Merchant. However, neither man is interviewed for the book as Kasthaus states that no Philadelphia writer of the era returned his phone calls except for Allen Lewis."
4,A quick and dirty read,"I was only 4 years old in 1964, yet many of the players were my heroes as I grew up and my father took me to Connie Mack Stadium. In particular we went to Bat Day every season, and I recall always getting a Richie Allen bat. I truly admired his play and was saddened to see him go and thrilled to see him return in 1975, although he was a shadow of his former self. While I enjoyed the book, the author's conclusion that Allen deserves to be in the Hall of Fame is ludicrous. He compares Allen to Berra, Campanella, Cepeda, Clemente and Killebrew in various categories. Allen comes up short in almost every category and to every player except Campanella (who only played 10 seasons).There is no denying Allen had HoF talent. However, due to circumstances largely under his own control, he failed to live up to it."
3,Middle-aged Phillies fans should read this,"Now that we're all older we can look back on this sad chapter in Philly sports with a bit more perspective. It's hard to stay mad at Richie Allen after you read this, especially if you aren't familiar with the story of his shameful treatment in Little Rock in 1963. If anything, you'll remember why you liked him in the first place. A decent read for a die-hard Phillies fan."
3,Recount monotonously,"Schubert's Winterreise is so deep and somber that few singers can carry it satisfyingly. In this new edition we find that again. Trekel's tone,tempo and Eisenlohr's touch are both ok, But it sounds they are just recounting the whole opus from the first song to the last, without deeply involving in the wintery, chilly, dark and despairing world. Some lieder were sung much mediocrely, like no.20 Der Wegweiser, no.15 Die Kraehe. Some sung tritely, like the famous no.5 Der Lindenbaum (It sounds very, very shallow. The heartbreaking atmosphere of the prelude and the mesmerizing singing melodie are both disappear). Certainly, At times there are a few sparkles shine , as in no.11 Fruehlingstraum. Their performance in this song is very moving."
5,Co-dependence Misunderstood-Mistreated,"This is the most comprehensive book I have read on co-dependence. It includes some clinical ""how you got there"" and some practical, helpful information on solving issues of the disease. I have a much better understanding of why and where I am today and how I may make my life better."
3,It's ok,"It has good information that is not commonly found, as comparison of what different professionals view on co-dependence. On the other hand the author seems to react co-dependent to these folks."
1,Visions of Europe,Really looked forward to this set. Discs came in two formats. My player can only read the two discs on Italy. The rest cannot be viewed. Became a pricey purchase.
1,Lemon,"Beware buying this Blu-ray if you live in Australia. I have never had a problem playing any DVD or Blu-ray that I have purchased from Amazon before, however, I cannot play these discs on my player. So be careful before spending this amount of money on Visions of Europe."
2,Misleading info; not High Def,"The description said ""Shot in high definition from a helicopter-mounted camera"" - so I bought it for that reason, thinking that it would be gorgeously crisp and detailed in High Definition. But it's not. So on my big TV it's not that clean of a view, buildings and sites are fuzzy... Definitely disappointing after eagerly anticipating this set.So, buyer beware - ""shot in high definition"" does NOT mean ""presented in high definition""."
4,West Gate of Europe is missing...,"I own all of this MASTERPICES, SEAPRATLY & recently purchased set of 9( as a birthday gift, I Highly recommend to every one for this reason ! )EVERY aspect of these REAL MASTERPIECES are in HIGHEST LEVEL ! After every survey I fill SO GREAT, as I just arrived from VERY EXPENSIVE-LUXUARY TOURE. I've been in all Western Europe, & just reason rating GENIUS WORK of crew - members 4 stars... is that: they're MISSING VERY IMPORTANT LOCATIONS ( I hope SO FAR...) like SPAIN & PORTUGAL !( I'm NOT Spaniard BTW...)Oh ! & Switzerland with some Scandinavian miracles...( I'm not even European ) If you guys COMPLETE your mission ?! I could NOT FIND THE AMAOUNT OF THE STARS to rate your GREAT..FANTASTIC..CLASSY.. WORK !!! THESE SUPERB DOCUMENTARYES are quite an event of century !!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH !Visions of Europe"
4,Gorgeous.,"It's beautiful stuff, there's no doubt about it. The images are crisp and vibrant. The 'Great Cities of Europe"" is this set's weak link -- hard to do a tour of so many in under an hour and do any one of them real justice. Overall though, this complete set is a gem."
4,Visions,I have only seen one but it is beautiful. I wish they could have walked around the ground taking video as well as by air.
5,Adorable and fun!,The animal is cute and the computer game is a lot of fun for my kids. It is a virtual world where you earn money to take care of your pet. The website is endless!
3,Chocolate Lab,When I received this in the mail I noticed the stitching seemed a little loose. The seller said this is sometimes a common thing with ganz webkins.
3,Not quite the thing,"It's true that this towel is very absorbent, that it dries fast after use, and all that jazz but it's just too small to wrap your hair with. I got it when I had short hair and it just didn't answer the purpose, now that I have long hair it works even less (and no I don't have a huge head or thick heavy hair). On the other hand the Aquis turban works great and I would highly recommend it instead of this towel. I keep it around as a hand towel."
4,Great towel,I have been using this towel for a few weeks now. It is incredibly absorbent and soft. I think my hair feels softer and healthier already. I bought two extra towels to give as Christmas gifts. I am quite happy with my purchase.
3,Nice towel! but high-priced (sometimes),"I was looking for a replacement for my thin ""hair towels"" which are now ragged with age. This works well -- thin and absorbent. As pointed out in the other reviews it's about the size of a larger hand towel, which is fine for me.However, based on the descriptions and the price, I'd hoped to have something super and amazing that would render my hair dryer all but obsolete. If you don't care what you spend, buy this towel -- but otherwise I wish I'd bought something cheaper. (I wanted to give 3.5 stars.)--I noticed just now that today's price is much lower than the over twenty dollars I paid. It won't let me change the stars, but I'd've rated it higher. Watch for sales!"
3,didn't really work for my hair,"I have long, fine, curly hair and this didn't work any different than a towel or a t-shirt. Now I just use it to dry my hands, but it may work for some."
3,Should be rated R,"This tape has quite a bit of violence in it, and can be disturbing. After viewing it, I decided that my younger children should not see it.Having said that, it was kinda fun, in a morbid sort of way. Plenty of car and motorcycle crashes which include gasoline-fueled explosions, basketball fights, football and soccer collisions, an extended hockey fight, baseball pile-ups, and a few very interesting harness racing crackups. I am sure there are several deaths filmed here. If you like this kind of stuff, then get it. If not, then don't.This is NOT a ""Blooper"" film."
3,Void of...something,"I'm a huge fan of De/Vision...but for some reason this album just does not click with me like the others. I'm not sure what it is. It's definitely more ""alternative"" and experimental, which is not always a bad thing...but in this case it's not a good thing. The songs lack the catchiness and seduction of other D/V albums. I don't particularly hate any of the songs - I just don't LOVE any of them. ""Foreigner,"" ""Self-Deception,"" ""Re-Invent Yourself,"" and ""Anywhere"" are probably my favorites, but they are nowhere near as good as classics like ""Drifting Sideways,"" ""Heart-Shaped Tumor,"" ""Dinner Without Grace,"" ""Sweet Life,"" ""We Fly...Tonight,"" ""All I Ever Do,"" ""Miss You More,"" ""Try To Forget,"" or the original version of ""Blue Moon""(just to name a few). If you are new to De/Vision, you might want to start with ""Fairyland,"" ""Monosex,"" ""Two,"" or ""Devolution"" (my favorites by far). But get ""Void"" to complete your collection."
3,Doesn't quite hit the mark.........,"I am a huge fan of De/Vision. I just don't quite understand what they're trying to do with this album. Experimenting? Reinventing? Regardless of that, I find it to be a miss! If you want to listen to their better creations, get ""Zehn"" album, or even the latest one ""Two."" Both albums are far far superbly done !! Peace !!"
5,A disc that lives up to its title ... absolute fun,"Wasted Time's debut, although it may appear to the average listener to be the typcial hackneyed pop-punk that such bands as Green Day and Rancid are notorious for, does not allow itself to be caught up in stereotypes or their own self image. In fact, with songs such as ""Imitation,"" the band adds a kind of self-parody to its repetoire, talking about imitating those who they want to be. The music is overtly fun, something that you can't sit still to, and there is not a bad song on the album (although ""Ignorance"" and ""Potluck"" kind of drag). Oddly enough, sandwiched between teen angst and self-parody is the ever-sweet sounding ""Brown-Eyed Girl,"" a re-tooling of the Van Morrison classic which girls will go nuts for and I found to be a refreshing delight. Buy this CD, listen to ""Heathcliff,"" ""Sick and Tired,"" and ""Tongue Tied"" and have a blast!"
5,changed my life immediately upon reading it!,"This book set me in many different directions all that have had a positive effect upon my life. Since reading it I have experimented with sprouting, solar power, cheese making, both dairy and sprout cheese, wheat and barley grass growing and ingesting, living and growing food in in small area conditions, thermos bottle cooking, algae ,distillation, bread baking, seaweed in the diet etc. I truly wish there was more inspirational and useful books such as this it has really changed my life for the better.I hope you can find a less pricey version , buy, read, and experiment with these subjects !! Have fun!!!"
4,A Haunting Collection of Stories,I just stumbled across the paperback edition of these stories and couldn't be more pleased. The characters are not so unique as their perceptions and responses to the world around them. Harun takes ordinary feelings of pain and loneliness and spins them out in new patterns so that the stories are new and imaginative. Her style is fluid and mesmerizing and each story has-I wouldn't say a surprise ending-but a sort of twist on the character's reality; she doesn't hit you over the head with it but arrives there gracefully. Hard to put down and I definitely look forward to more.
5,The Classic,My teacher always refers to this book first in class. It is pretty comprehensive and easy to see the process. A little of everything.
2,A Londoner,"Every song sounded the same. No change of inflection of voice - or ""orchestra"" for that matter, no change of beat, and no change of singer. I was very disappointed."
5,A Haunting Book!,I had to read it twice to have the story really sink in. This book is very moving and quiet. A really great job from Eve Bunting and a book to be remembered.
4,Great Story,"Very moving, very powerful discussion point with kids grades 1-4. Highly reccommend for story or book discussion groups."
5,More fun than I thought it would be.. and tougher too..,I was expecting somethign smaller.. but this still was able to fly in the large room of my house.. and outside in the yard.. very sensitive to wind.. but fun.
2,Stick with fiction,"I have read some of Mr. Carey's works and have enjoyed his novels. He should stick with writing fiction. Wrong About Japan: A Father's Journey with His Son, is marketed and sold under non-fiction but I have discovered (along with other reviewers here) that he created one of the characters in this book in order to have more...conflict? Takashi was a kid that Carey's son, Charlie, met online and would serve as a guide of sorts in/around Tokyo. But to find out Takashi is completely fabricated makes me sad -- Mr. Carey had to make up someone in order to make his book more..saleable? Readable? What?This book was a disappointment in that one doesn't learn much about Japan, anime or even about Mr. Carey and his son (they both come off as rather annoying travelers). But I must congratulate Mr. Carey for earning a fat paycheck and getting a free trip to Japan to write this book. But I sure got duped."
1,A simpleton's view,"The author is clearly arrogant, demeaning, and uneducated. How did this author win awards? He tells a simpleton's view of Japanese culture while seemingly forgoing fact-checking altogether."
4,"This book is about parenting, not about anime","As many other reviewers have noted, this book will NOT tell you much about anime or manga. However, Peter Carey does provide an ironic glimpse into parenting a teenager, in that the reader ends up more sympathetic for the son than the father. Carey doesn't empathize with his son, he puts his own minor interests ahead of showing respect for his son, he fails to communicate his feelings, the list goes on. So I wonder if this book is really a long apology letter to his son for all that went wrong on the trip to Japan. I doubt whether Carey could have conveyed his ill-preparedness for communicating and showing respect in Japan, or for how deeply embarrassing yhis behavior was for his son, had he not at last realized his mistakes. Parents may well find practical warnings here for how not to relate to their teenager."
5,This is a no-nonsense practical approach to pain relief.,"When you're in pain, nothing seems too extreme in the pursuit of relief. Bonnie Prudden's writing easily demystifies the subject and gives a comprehensive way to reduce and in many cases erase pain totally. It works! It really works! The book is written in a personal and conversational style--clever, witty and wise. It is easy to understand and easy to implement. The exercises which are required in the therapy are unique in that they employ only full range of motion movements: some are not as glamourous as those of the spandex-clad exercise classes, but the biomechanical accuracy of Bonnie's stretches and strengthening regiments are based on decades of research and success. I thank god for having discovered all of Bonnie's writings and hope everyone receives as much benefit as my students and I have in our quest for a quality and pain-free life."
5,Great book,"A nurse friend lent me hers to read. After that I just had to find a copy. As a person who always has tight muscles, it was good to see where all the different muscles are and what you can do to make the aches&pains go. This is a good book to have. The book came fast and was in excellent condition."
3,Pain Erasure,"Pain Erasure by Bonnie Pruden was not created for individual use. It was written forthose who are learning to become physical therapist and want to practice ""Myotherapy""on patients. There is some useful and interesting information in it, but for the mostpart, it takes 2-3 people to perform the treatments outlined in this book. Also, thecopy of Pain Erasure I received has a copyright date of ""1980 - 32 years old!"" Thedescription of it on Amazon is very misleading and should be changed. The seller sentme an email and acted as if they didn't want to refund my money! I told them it's theprinciple of the matter - they need to follow the terms and agreement set forth byAmazon."
2,Incomprehensible,"I tried to find specific conditions in the book - and the procedures to follow for treating them. I couldn't even figure out the procedures to follow when reading them - the writing just isn't very clear.If there is any organization to this book, I couldn't detect it. The author is very enthusiastic about the material and gives lots of her experiences with her patients. That's nice, but judicious editing, better organization and clarity is what this book needs."
3,Avid Reader,A clear and concise book with understandable information that can be put to practical use.
3,A good book,"In my opinion, this book is very good. there is very vivid decription in the story and the story line is great. i read this book when i was 9 and i was enchanted. this book with out a doubt a good book to read. i would recommend it to any child..."
3,I want to be Keisha!,"I don't care what anyone says about Keisha, it would be my greatest thrill to be the Snow Queen. I loved every page of this book except the ending where I simply didn't want it to end."
1,Keisha the Fairy Snow Queen,I don't like the book. Keisha and her friends think of only themselves. They make up lies to keep them out of trouble. They go to sombody's house that's not theirs. I don't recommend the book.
1,Inaccurate And Lacking Detail,"This manual has failed me twice. The first difficulties were encountered when a forward CV joint became noisy. In direct contradiction to the manual the outer front CV joints can be replaced as serviceable parts without the need to replace the drive shafts. Secondly, I'm chasing a fault whereby my Subaru Legacy has difficulty changing down gears even when under load with the throttle pedal nailed to the firewall. The information on the automatic transaxle is very poor, plus there is a lack of depth surrounding how the engine management system interacts to achieve downshifting. The wiring diagrams are too schematic to diagnose which sensor I'm looking at, plus actual wiring colours often contrast those specified."
4,Liked the book,The price was right and the information was clear. Without this book I would have been at risk for a rip off.
4,"Good basic information, pictures & diagrams","The book is in decent condition and information is good, but could use more information in it. It's a typical Haynes/Chilton type manual."
3,It is OK,"The book was good enough to guide me for head gaskets replacement. With the book description, a little imagination, and some web sources (especially for torque specifications) I was able to accomplish the work.The electrical schemes are very general lacking a lot of information (like rear power socket, heated seats, etc.) Some of the diagrams are inaccurate. The one for automatic window switch, for example, on 1997 Outback reverses the contacts for ""up"" and ""down"" position."
3,A Different View,"Bruce Cockburn fans are reminded that this is first and foremost a jazz album, albeit a good one, and far from Bruce's style. I had difficulty identifying some of the songs without help from the label. Every piece seems to be played in a different genre which never let me get comfortable with their style. Some individual performances were very good."
5,"Soothing, smells ok, and is a smooth texture","In the past, family members have used BF&C on sprains and bruises, and they had more rapid healing. This product (Complete Tissue & Bone) seems to work the same as BF&C. When you first rub it into the skin, it has a warm sensation. The texture was smooth, easy to apply, and smelled ok."
5,complete tissue and bone ointment,"This product does what it says, it gives the cells the building blocks to heal really well and fast. It is the no. one thing to use for broken bones, wounds,etc. Ive never bought or used such an outstanding herbal product. I read some pretty amazing testimonials online at Dr. Christophers website and this product lives up to the hype. a rare thing in this world indeed."
5,"I think this is an awesome album, all the songs are great!",This is an album no one should miss. I totally over play it and I can't seem to get sick of them. I continue to blast their songs when they come on the radio and they always put me in a good mood.
5,"If you like BIG sound, you'll love Creed","Singer, drummer, lead/rythum guitarist, bass guitarist - basic stuff. But Creed takes basic Big Sound rock to a much higher level with lyrics that crush typical Christian rock style. I give this band 5 stars for combining big rock sound with bold lyrics."
5,Clean Rock,"Sure Stapp can sing, and I really like the lyrics that he wites, but my favorite part of this cd (and group) is Tremonti's guitar play. He can make that instrument of his sing! The thing with this CD is the ""Classic Rock"" feeling it hints at. Human Clay has a heavier sound to it and Weathered is just an experiment. Even though it has a bit of the classical rock feeling, it still has a nice loud and heavy sound. This is not one of those ""Liquid-Metal"" bands (Such as; Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park and so on...). This IS a rock band!"
5,Powerful Lyrics - A Must Own,"Creeds album My Own Prison has to be one to the best albums of any genre in the 90's. Lead singer Scott Strapp has a powerful soulful voice and the band is musically solid. This album is definitely lyrically driven followed by a solid collection of music.The album hosts a collection of ten songs and not a single one disappoints. The lyrics show off the bands excellent writing talent and poetic style that take on many of today's hot topics. Songs like ""What's this life for,"" ""Torn,"" and ""My Own Prison,"" are great examples of deep lyrics delivering a powerful message. After you get through the heavy stuff the album finishes off with great song with a message for world unity.Overall this album was a great surprise to me and made me an instant creed fan. Well worth the money spent and I would recommend it to anybody who likes hard rock delivered with hard poetry about issues in the world minus any sugar coating."
4,Creed's best album,"I will admit that the first few times i heard ""my own prison"" on the radio i thought it was a new Pearl Jam song. Only a few days later finding out it was a brand new band called ""Creed"". I bought the cd and really enjoyed it. Yeah, their sound is not very unique (think Vedder singing with Metallica) but the message that Stapp sings about is.Songs like My Own Prison, Whats this Life for, and Torn really hit a cord with people looking for someone to express the angst that they felt. At the time, Alice in Chains had already dissolved, Pearl Jam had made a weird sounding middle-eastern record, and Soundgarden had broken up. Creed stepped up to the plate.During Creed's follow up records they got more and more 'commercial' sounding and they now stand as the ""Journey"" for the 2000s but there was a time when Creed was a humble, young rock band trying to be heard.My Own Prison will go down as Creed's masterpiece."
5,Better than the non-import version,This CD is better than the non-import version because of the extra songs. This CD shows the great talent of creed. Deep meaningful lyrics and powerful rock music make a steller combination. Creed's songs express the song which is in almost everybodies soul. Every song is worth listening too on this CD.
1,yeah uh no,ok so i don't own this import cd. but it only has 2 songs on it? why spend 25 dollars on two songs? i don't care if you are in love with creed i can tell you it'll be a waste. too bad i can't give it no stars.
2,This CD is...bad.,"Creed's ""Weathered"" was better than this. ""My Own Prison"", Creed's (i think) debut album, has got songs that are extremely long, and most are boring, except for the first one. Not worth buying."
2,Meant to be played loud,"If you like pounding guitars and lyrics that sound like Pearl Jam, you'll like this album.Having said that, the intense lyrics and consistent rhythm make this by no means one of the worse albums one could buy."
2,go buy a pearl jam or alice in chains record instead,"There is way too much similarity between this band and the grunge sound that has had its day. If you want good grunge music, buy 1) Any Alice in Chains disc or 2) Any Pearl Jam before 1996. But get better grunge while it's available."
3,"What's up with the ""God Rock""???????",I ran right out and bought this albun for it's edgy guitar feel and soulful vocals and was somewhat disappointed at the relentless religiuos undertones....the pushy religios messages are the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 starts...c'mon guys - Rock and Roll is supposed to be FUN!!!!!!!
2,A lot to think about.......,"Pretty good. If you don't mind the same basic song over and over (same voice, same tune, same mello-depressing, over-dramatic lyrics), and the slightly annoying ""change in pace"" throughout the cuts, it's a pretty good CD. Not one I would listen to again and again but certainly a meaningful mention."
5,Blew My Mind...,There is nothing bad at all about this Cd. It is 50 Minutes of music worth the money and time. Go buy it if you like this music genre or any type of rock music. I also Reccomend the following:Nickelback-Silver Side UpCreed-Human ClayStaind-Break The CycleCreed-WeatheredCarnage-Bullet Box(Should Come Out in 2013)
1,It got boring really quickly.,"Pearl Jam? Perhaps the lead vocalist does sound like Vedder at times, but I don't hear the resemblance in the music. The songs on the album got boring in a short amount of time. I thought they sounded like a poor imitation of the mighty Alice In Chains. ""My Own Prison"" was about the only decent song on the album and was what caused me to purchase the album which now belongs to a friend who is not a true hard rock/metal fan...Note of advice: Don't waste your time--everything that was worth listening to by these guys has already been played on the radio."
5,CREED - 1,I think CREED is the BEST BAND . There music is excellent. I seen them in Concert in Tennessee and they were wonderful!!!!!!!
5,Definately a MUST have in your music collection,"This cd not only is musically tight, the lyrics are about God, spirtuality, and the real struggles of being a believer in God. It is intense not grungy."
3,cool,"this cd is pretty good. it has some not real good songs but basically the rest is awesome. and all the people that say that creed is just a copy of pearl jam or soundgarden, jees. yeah they sound somewhat the same but soundgarden sounds like metallica and they sounded like led zepplin. so everyone soiunds like someone else."
3,average cd,"On the whole I give this Cd 67%, only about 4 songs deserve any recognition on this album, and as time passes one finds it hard to differentiate between them. Maybe I'm being a bit 2 critical the 4 songs are mentioned earlier are captivating with powerfull chords and riffs, but why bother when theres so many better cd's out there?"
4,Early Pearl Jam on Steroids,"I'd only had the CD a couple weeks and didn't know what to expect when I went to see these guys play at a tiny bar. But man, when they launched into it, all I could think of was ""Pearl Jam on steroids."" I'm not talking Vitology--early stuff. And I'm not even a PJ fan! Saw 'em again at a much bigger venue 2 months ago and, with the great crowd feeding off the engery, the show was over the top. I echo all the other reviews I've been seeing: intelligent lyrics; hard, tight and melodic sound; and a GREAT live show. My only negative comments: Creed can tend to get preachy, so if you can't handle a little different point of view you may be turned off. When you stand for something, you pick up some detractors. I'm sure the boys know this and will shrug off the nay-sayers."
3,Alice in Chains Remake,"A little harder perhaps, but I still can't help feeling like I'm listening to Alice in Chains, only with less talent. Granted, they have a few good songs, but they are not original in the least; they only seem like it because of the Matchbox 20-Third Eye Blind plague that is currently killing the rock world. Compare them to any decent group from the 70's (Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and so many more) and they look like just more of the same crap. Take my advice and spend your money on something worthwhile and meaningful, like a Led Zeppelin album."
5,My Own Prison Review,I have always loved Creed when I first listened to them when I was 3. I think this is their best album yet. Anyone who rates this under four stars has no life or taste what-so-ever.
4,Very Good CD...,Haven't heard a CD that rocks this good since Alice In Chains - Dirt. I highly recommend it for the alternative fans. Listen Loud!!
5,Creed Rules,I also saw them for the 1st time at Woodstock and was just blown away. I definitely think the lead singer sounds like Jim Morrison and when they brought out Robbie Krieger during their Woodstock gig I was just floored. Bought this cd the day after I saw them and can't get enuff!
4,CrEeD RoCkS,I heard them before and was not to sure of them. But them i saw them Live at woodstock. I think they were one of the best acts there. Lead singer Scott Stapp had the crowd goin every second of their performance. Thats when i decided that they are one of the best groups around.
5,it was wonderfully written and well performed,"there are not many blacks that listen to rock but i had the chance to hear them live 2 years ago and they got me hooked. all of the songs, especially the ones played on the related to a lot of the trials and tribulations i had in my life. you could tell that their music relayed to a lot of their own experiences and that is what touched me the most. i recommend this album to any individual who actually has a taste for good music!"
5,The angst is back,"A powerful, angst-ridden band that delivers. A throwback to the early '90s when good rock music was being produced by Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Nirvana. But to those who fill they may be ""absurd"" or ""hypocritical"" that they may curse or use dark imagery, they are not a Christian rock band; they have only been influenced by the lead singer's religious upbringing. If you want to be moved on every track, then this is the CD for you."
5,"Five big ones, no doubt about it","It's enough to see the reviews on this page to see how much people loves this CD (Except ""the Mother"" who is a obviously too old for this cind of music). It was release here in ICELAND only few days ago and we have been waiting for it for a long time, and the wait was worth it!!!!!!!!!"
5,I LOVE CREED!!,This CD is one I never get tired of listening to. Every song on it rocks! Creed is a great band and I can't wait to hear more songs from them. You won't regret buying this CD!
4,Impressive debut,I won't deny how good this album is.After releasing three studio albums creed can still be remembered for this album which saw them making an impressive debut.My own prison is slightly different from the albums that were released after it but is still a masterpiece.What makes creed and their albums so great is guitarist Mark Temonti.He is without a doubt one of the best guitarists ever.The album itself has amazing music that stems from mark's amazing ability to do magic with a guitar.The songs themselves are heavy but rythmic.Scott Stapp adds to the whole experience with his strong voice and meaningful lyrics.In the end the cd has a mixture of both soft and heavy metal tunes that will keep playing in your head.This stuff is heavily addictive and not surprisingly because it's creed.
5,My Own Reason,"This is an AMAZING album.1. Torn (4.5/5)- an AWESOME song. The progression from an acoustic to an electric is great.2. Ode (4/5)- pretty much an electric the whole song through, pretty cool.3. my Own Prison (5/5)- a song with so much meaning, Creed's best song EVER.4. Pity for a dime (5/5)- second best song on the album. Another progression from acoustic electric.5. In America (5/5)- fantastic song.6. Illusion (2.5/5)- not too fond of this one7. Unforgiven (3/5)- this one's O.K.8. Sister (5/5)- great song9. What's this life for (3.5/5)- okay10. One (5/5)- Beautiful melodic song to end an awesome album"
5,Awesome debut album,This is an amazing album by probably one of the best bands out there....they will certainly make it big if they carry on making such amazong music.
3,This is good.....but,I bought this cd about four days ago and it is pretty good but I still like Creed's cd human Clay a whole lot better! I just think that this cd is a little too hard rock/metal for me. If you like hard rock though this cd is for you. I really like Creed.s style and the way they have an indonesian vibe to the guitar. That's really cool! I reccomend this cd to any rock and roll fan.
4,Creed What happen?,"Now for starters I like all kinds of music. So I am not one those MTV TRL people, I know music! I like everything from Ozzy to Lamb of God to Alice In Chains to Slayer to Tool to NIN to Seether, to Pantera to Type O to etc etc etc. Now when I turned on my radio in my car and the song My Own Prison comes on for the 1st time. So I went out and picked up this cd and I was like wow this whole cd is good. I can pop it in and play it from the 1st track to the last. Now about the time their next cd comes out I picked it and played it and I had to take it out of my cd player and look to see if it's the same band. Sure info it was so I gave it away to my brother. After hearing that cd I have hated them ever sence then. All you need from these guys is this cd don't pick up anything else from these guys or you will having a $15.00 toy for your dog."
3,on their way,"Compared to the music Creed later gave us, this debut album must be qualified as a strong start. Understandably, it falls short of the band's mature sound.Still, there are some rockin' good tracks here. They were signaling the Creed they'd become.Some of the lyrics are a bit self-possessed, but on the way to breakout.Stapp's voice is as good as it gets, but the band had not yet caught up with him.'Not to worry, however: they would do so in good time. And then the music would get to be a very good thing."
1,Christian Music God Doesn't Approve Of,"Thank you Creed for failing to revive grunge. Thanks for also influencing a bunch of s**tty bands on Wind-up records and such. Another thing, thanks for splitting up. If Nathan Gale were to shoot somebody other than the legendary Dimebag Darrell, he should either shoot Scott Stapp, Fred Durst, Chester Bennington OR Eminem."
2,Creed wishes they were as talented as Soungarden,"I swear, I thought I was listening to that POS wanna be grunge band Creed when I heard Jesus Christ Pose and Room A Thousand Years Wide off Soundgarden's 1991 release Badmotorfinger. I can't stand listening to poser bands like Creed. Soundgarden and vocalist Chris Cornell basically created Grunge music wat back in 1983, back when Creed was still in diapers. Too many people say Stapp sounds like an Eddie Vedder ripoff. Listen to Cornell's vocal stylings. Stapp is a Cornell ripoff more than anything."
3,OK Grunge,"Creed is basically a Christian version of Pearl Jam, nothing wrong with them if that's your thing. Creed have managed to go mainstream by de-emphasizing the theology and thus being acceptable to a mainstream audience."
2,My own prison,I believe that the mark of a good album is a continuing desire to listen to it months and years after you have purchased it. This is the case with a number of albums in my collection but not My Own Prison. Creed's first effort contains several decent songs and that's about it.My Advice: Skip the album and buy the single if necessary. Consider purchasing a Pearl Jam or Soundgarden album.
2,"Good music, but excessive religious overtones turn me off.","My Cousin (coincidentally, both he and the band are from Florida) directed me to buy this album, but I'm wishing I hadn't. I had heard two of the songs (My Own Prison and What's This Life For?) on the radio but had not especially payed attention to the lyrics. When I read them in the CD cover I was suprised. Some messages are helpful when sent in the medium of popular music, but religion (""...We the meek are all in one, I hear a thunder in the distance, see a vision of a cross..."" etc) is a somewhat annoying and unsavory message for those who are not believers. Though Creed's music is good and Scott Stapp has an nice and interesting voice, those pros are outweighed, at least in my mind, by the ... Christian overtones of their lyrics. If you're looking for good hard rock, there are many better choices out there."
5,This CD is one of the most amazing albums I have ever heard.,After hearing the title track My Own Prison on the radio for about a month I finally decided to buy the CD. Creeds sound is reminiscent of Metallica and Stone Temple Pilots which turns out being one the best sounding bands probably of this decade.
3,"Solid rock, but not very inventive","This is just good, old-fashioned, guitar-based rock. No tracks really stand out on this album, not even the radio singles, but this is a solidly-produced album. There are those who'd give it a lower rating because it's uninventive, but I care less about inventiveness in rock music than I do about how well it's performed. These guys know their instruments, be it voice or guitar, and do a good job with them. Nice effort."
4,Very Good,"I didn't get this Disc until after 'Human Clay' and while I like it a lot, it is not as good as 'Human Clay'. However, I would recommend it to anyone."
5,so much meaning behind this...,"This is the first band that has come out in the late nineties that has good meaningful lyrics to their songs (Limp Bizkit's and Korn's lyrics are often dense). You can actually feel the pain and emotion in these songs. Scott Stapp's meaningful vocals are truly inspiring. Every song on this album is good, only ""Ode"" and ""Sister"" lack greatness. But the other 8 songs are great songs with great music and great lyrics. I highly recommend this album, it is worth every penny."
5,The best album of the late '90s,"This album is one of the best albums ever. Torn, My Own Prison, Unforgiven, and What's this Life For are my favorites. I would without a doubt recommend this cd to any rock fan."
5,Shows the natural talent of creed,"This CD shows the natural talent of creed. This is their freshman albumn, and shows that they can write songs that compete with the big boys. Every song on here is enjoyable, and like their sophmore CD of Human Clay, this CD shows that Creed are gods of rock, they can write deep lyrics, play a mean guitar, and make it all sound great."
5,"Powerful, meaningful, this CD moved me- you should own it","I really hope they make another album. every track on this CD rocks. Somebody find these guys and get them into a studio before one of them does something stupid. If I could recommend that you buy only one album this year, and you aren't part of the machine and like strong music and words that mean something, buy this one."
4,Creed has a quality sound with unusually positive lyrics.,"I think Creed's debut album is excellent. Creed has a well-rounded quality sound which is enhanced by edifying lyrics (which seem to be very uncommon these days in mainstream groups). Creeds analysis of the problems facing society today is very much correct, however, their solutions for these problems are uncertain. All in all, Creed has proven that successful mainstream music can have good morals as well as good melodies. As a Christan, it is very refreshing to listen to a quality band that seeks to return to the discarded values of the past. Creed's uncompromising message of purity has restored my faith in the music industry. I can't waith for their next full-length release. Buy the CD man!!!"
5,This cd is the best!!!,"The Creed cd ""My Own Prison"" is excellent. The best track is the title track. I just got this cd today and have listened to it many times already. I hope to hear more of them in the future."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this CD after hearing My Own Prison, and What's this life for. WIth the exception these songs and One, I wish I had sampled the other songs via Real Audio."
2,Hard Rock Suckage,"I saw these guys per chance during this tour. They played Horde for some unknown reason. With all the hype that surrounds these schlemiels, i can't get over the played out rock poses of Mr. stapp and the atrocious penchant for writing tunes that are only enjoyed by those who drink PBR in a smokey hick bar. Rev up your truck, grow your mullet and move to the sunny coast. I will give them two stars based on the fact that all of thier songs sound the same, but don't necessarily make my ears bleed."
4,This is the best CD I've bougtht this year.,"""My own Prison"" will play on Classic Rock statins for the next 30 years!"
4,Rock fans should have this album,"This album, while not the best of it and Human Clay, has a lot going for it. The songs are a bit faster for the most part than Human Clay, and consequently, there seems to be more energy in this one. Torn, My Own Prison, Pity for a Dime, and One are masterpieces. Granted, this album isn't perfect (such as on ""Illusion"" and ""Unforgiven""). But this album rocks, and has enough good songs to make this one of your favorite albums."
2,"Depressing and vulgar, yet Christian","Ok, there are about 6 songs on My Own Prison that are pretty good as a single, but it is depressing to listen to the whole disk. It's way too much of the same depressing stuff. Torn, My Own Prison, and One are good radio songs, and there are a few others, but I can't make it through the whole disk. Also there is the ridiculous fact that Creed claims to be Christian, but uses some colorful language in What's this life for. I think that this CD is basically depressing and makes no real sense. There are many better mainstream and Christian bands."
4,some good songs,"i like all of the songs on this cd, but one of them. i think that it is a good quality in a disc/group when all of the songs on their album are ones that you can listen to over and over again without getting tired of them"
2,10 Years too late.,"Though a talented band, Creed simply takes all the elements of the grunge bands of the early 90's and makes them their own. Listen to Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, and Pearl Jam. Creed is NOT an original band. Creed is whats wrong with the music industry today."
2,Maybe this band would be ok if they didnt completely rip off 5 bands,"wow. ""Torn"" sounds like Alice In Chains, every other song sounds like a mix of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, With Arms Wide Open is one of the most lame songs ever, and every song isnt that great anyway. This band gives me goosebumps. So lame.Get some Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead....the list goes on and on."
1,waste of hard earned money!,"With the exception of about two songs,this C.D is a big waste of money.The lyrics are okay but the overall sound of this music is at best,annoying.Big load of rubbish I'm afraid.It's like getting a smacking around the ears.Badly played music too raw around the edges.Creed need to sharpen up their skills to make this even the least bit bareable.Don't bother."
1,no!no! it's very very boring.....,"i dont like this album, frankly speaking, i think this is very very boring...but i like their's new single 'higher'...."
5,Hard to say goodbye!,"When I come back to this album now, 7 years since it was released into the mainstream in 1997 it brings back many memories from that year. I remember the first time I heard the song ""my own prison"" being a christian I was drawn to the images of the song, and could feel the passions of the group. Each of the songs on this album are solid rock songs, with a very hard sound. On whole this is creed's best album, from start to finish, and anyone who buys this album who comes to it with no stigmas against the band will be treated to one heck of a cd!"
2,There is better out there....,"Despite the praises sung by the men who serve in tanks as a story and the ability to suspend your disbelief this shows many first time writer problems. Specifically what destroys the story for me is time scale. Everything that happens, in the sequence that it does, just does not work.In the old days when you used a typewriter to craft a story one would most likely have the time sequence written out to guide as the story was developed. In this day an age maintaing a list on the computer you are writing the story on and having it open at the same time seems very achievable. This story fell apart too many times for me because the time sequence did not make sense. So do I care whether the portrayal of an actual tank experience is accurate any longer. Not at all.Stick to Laryy Bond's version of a North Korean attack on the South. Much better."
2,Not much better than reading a technical manual,"Back in the '80's, we tankers used to laugh at Harold Coyle's books. It was as if the Army wanted their troops to read tactics & manuals, so they put all the information in a novel -it's the closest we ever got to reading our tech books.This book is an updated version of that process - the technical stuff is spot on. Fire commands, boresighting, yada yada yada. As far as plot line, character development or realistic plot? That got left in the motor pool. I'm a die hard tanker. If your mind works in two dimensions, this book is ok. otherwise, I'd prefer a Clancy with inaccuracies than this book with its facts. Predictable plot and ending. Two stars - one because it's about tanks, one because it gives an insider view of tanking."
5,Barbeque From A Distance,This hook is good when you grill. The long hook helps you stay out of the hot areas.
3,Lemmy is god,"Well if Lemmy is god then why did I give it only 3 stars? I thought this book was like a diary that was all over the place. I couldn't keep interested enough with some of it to keep reading. Only for a diehard fan I guess, not someone who was curious about his life."
5,Perfect !!!,Lemmy writes same as he lives or rock - straight forward with no regards for the feelings of others and no modern bullshit like politically correctness - funny to read
3,"Good read, bit light on detail","I liked the book, though not a big Motorhead fan. Read a little more like a diary and while Lemmy touches on characters in his life he never goes deep into relationships, but the read does give a good insight to life touring in the 70s and 80s (I guess). Lemmy also shares his opinions very rarely, which is a pity as when he does he talks a lot of sense."
5,Lemmy the legend!,Really great read and hilarious as well....excellent perspective from one of metal's founding fathers...Lemmy has been around the music scene since the early sixties and has a lot of history to share with his fans....
3,Expected better from Lemmy,"A chronological history of Lemmy and Motorhead. While he had his funny moments, for the most part, it's a dry straight forward book about Lemmy and Motorhead. Nothing too exciting."
3,A light quick read.,"Let me say firstly this book is all over the place and jumps from on subject matter to another in just a sentence. However this give this book its charm, OK its slightly frustrating when Lemmy recounts a part of his life and career and then moves on to his next tangent. The book is a very quick read and is very amusing in parts."
3,"As always, Lemme is interesting.. but this book is ok.","I'd probably want to give this book 3.5 stars. A lot of talk about old 50's rock n roll outfits I'm not interested in. Sometimes Lemme goes into things that just lose my interest. Die-hard fans may enjoy this, especially people who are in their late 40's and up, as some of the references will be more relevant to you. It's worth a look."
3,Good not great,Kind of a tour diary/journal of Lemmy's life. Not much insight as to who he is or what makes him tick.
4,Great Book from a living Legend!! A must read for all Motorhead fans.,"I loved this book. A very fun read about sex, drugs, and rock n roll!! Lemmy is a classic. Buy it."
4,The other way 'round,"Well, for starters I kinda bought this book out of sheer curiosity.I knew some of Motörhead's music and I read and saw some interviews with Lemmy (plus I figured that a guy that survives this long in the rock business OUGHT to be one of a kind...!) but I can't say I'm a Motörhead fan.Or am I not?After I read that funny and witty autobiography I looked at Lemmy with different eyes; he's certainly not the average person and he's got a lot more to tell that what you might think... and he also puts it down in a clever way. Maybe a bit rude, sometimes, but that's one thing I at lest expected, so to speak...Now I thing I'm gonna check out his music with a lot more attention...!...go figure...!"
1,not happy with the product!,"I was eagerly waiting for this watch to arrive but totally disappointed when found out that the watch does not work at all!Returning it right away.Waiting to hear back from the vendor , hope i will not have to pay for the return S&H;."
2,Quality is not there,"We purchased this door several years ago when we used one in Florida. We loved it because it was the perfect solution for the door system at the front of our family room. It operated fairly well for a while, but deteriorated quickly. We have since purchased a better quality retractable screen door and had a wider range of color choices than just white & black. It was roughly twice the price of this one, but well worth it. NOTE TO SMALL PET OWNERS: Please beware that your pet WILL be able to get out if you have a retractable screen. It if it wants to, it will simply lift the screen and sneak out underneath!"
4,Nice screen,"Upon opening the box it was broken. I contacted the manufacture and after they confirmed my order, they immediately sent me a replacement. It works great and was fairly easy for my handy husband to install. Perfect front door screen!We love it!"
3,Honestly,"I am an architecture student and this book was assigned in my studio class. Although the reading can be difficult to follow, it is highly informative about the design process and challenges you to do further research to expand your knowledge. If you are buying this, don't be afraid to take that extra step while reading. Knowledge is power, Are you up to the challenge?"
1,If I wanted Spyro Gyra I would have asked for it!,"I am without any doubt a genuine Acoustic Alchemy fan. I have been since their first recording. Nevertheless, this isn't Acoustic Alchemy as I know it. I am not saying this because of Nick Web's passing. I loved the post Nick Web album ""Beautiful Game"" and said so in a review here. This however, is some of the worst 1980's middle of the road stuff I have ever heard. There is only one bright spot on this CD: the song Passion Play. It is worth the money even if the whole CD is unremarkable and uninteresting.Stewart Coxhead in the liner notes of the CD makes mention that this album is a ""metamorphosis"" of sorts. Well if it is, then Alchemy has gone from beautiful to ugly in one album. In keeping with the spirit of metamorphosis they should change their name as well. This is not Acoustic Alchemy."
3,A big ball of salad seasoned with many spices,"I am new to jazz and certainly new to AART. In fact, this is the first AART albut that I own. I have listened to it in the music store and had to have it straight away. I instantly liked what I heard but suspected that concentrated/focused listening will uncover many new flavours. It is no surprise that I have been drawn into the music just like when you start eating a ball of salad and keep discovering new, unexpected flavours. What do I mean...? Jazzy, groovy, latin, funky overtones with masterful guitar playing, surrounded by horns. Don't be fooled, this is not 'background' music. Just try it with your headphones."
5,The Standard for All Others,"Delicious Music should be the standard by which all others follow. They were timely, competatively priced and described the product exactly - no surprises!"
1,The Stewart Coxhead cover blurb is just self-serving spin .........,"The first 13 tracks are unfocused, uninspired, smooth jazz dreck. And then the album closes with a typical Acoustic Alchemy gem. It looks like Greg Carmichael saying farewell to the old sound, which apparently came more from the heart of Nick Webb.So I won't be listening to this band anymore, but I'll always be thankful for the great music made when Nick was alive. And I'll never forget how blown away I was on first hearing ""Red Dust and Spanish Lace"", an absolute classic and one of the greatest guitar albums ever recorded."
1,Who are these guys?,"I'm so unhappy with this new direction that really began with Beautiful Game, and now is developing further with Aart. I have every single CD that AA has put out, every one of them, and Aart is really bad! Why try to sound like someone else? Get rid of the horns, and get back to what you made you guys great, and get back to that wonderful acoustic guitar sound that we have all loved for so many years. Please!"
5,"Not the same, but still Great","After reading the reviews here, I decided that it is time for me to throw my 2 cents in. I have been an avide listner of Acoustic Alchemy for as long as I can remember, and I liked their sound with the nylon and string guitar. And I'll also admit this is a far stray from previous albums, but it is still an awesome CD that is sure to get you grooving.Other reviewers have put this CD down on the base reason that it is not ""Acoustic Alchemy."" If that is the only reason you have, that does not make it a bad CD. In fact, this CD is great with many hummable tunes that you will have stuck in your head for days.So don't blow this CD off because it isn't that same old AA, but pick it up because it is a great CD."
4,Euro Horror that Inspired H.P. Lovecraft,"This is the first and probably only English language appearance of Maurice Level's novel, THOSE WHO RETURN. It is a gripping psychological study of madness and its relation to the supernatural. Level's stories were translated in English and published in horror anthologies and also in the legendary WEIRD TALES magazine. A copy of this book was in H.P. Lovecraft's library, and he mentions Level in his letters and in his study of horror literature, SUPERNATURAL HORROR IN LITERATURE. Long out of print and hard to find, this book is for those who appreciate twisted literature in the tradition of Maupassant, Nerval and the Grand Guignol."
5,my kids love them!,Great product! My kids love them! They are on the GFCF diet and it's great to find snacks they like to eat!
5,Tastiest snack around,These are by far my favorite snack food. They also happen to be one of the only Lundberg Rice Chips that are completely vegan. They have the perfect blend of spices and a great crunch without being too spicy. The only problem I find is that they are very high in sodium.
2,Warning - MSG,"Yes they taste great. It is no wonder because they contain MSG in the form of yeast extract. Try Rice Works sea salt (also sold here) - they have only salt, taste even better, and are chea[per"
3,seem fattier than corn chips,"I am gluten and dairy allergic so I am always looking for variety. These are okay but they seem fattier than corn chips...maybe it is the lower fiber content. I read here that ""corn goes straight to your hips"". I have never heard that but it seems that a higher fiber content would be valuable. The pico de gallo are much better than these plain ones. I am not going to throw them in the trash but they are not very yummy."
2,Migraine Food!,"Sure they're tasty, but they trigger a migraine in MSG sensitive people.Also, they contain corn, which also contributes to their tastiness I'm sure,but seems silly for a ""Rice"" chip, which is what I thought I was buying to avoid corn."
3,first time,"This is a first for me ,a omar &the howlers that did not grab me straight away .there is a not enough of mr dykes changing the tone of his voice resulting at times a dull monotone,I may be getting old but some of the experiments in style leave dead especially track two the title track ,if I heard a screaming cat like this I would set my dogs on it DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ,GO OUT AND BUY ANY OTHER OMAR&THE HOWLERS C.D NOT THIS ONE!"
1,Its pretty bad.,"The reason I got this is because it was cheap and I'm aiming for a full 32X collection. Don't pay more than 3 dollars for it. The camera is weird and bouncy, and the controls are AWFUL."
1,One of the worst games I have played for 32X,"This game has poor graphics, and really has little entertainment. If you own the system and want a full collection buy this for maybe a dollar. Not worth any more."
3,Nothing special. Good Introduction to Sql Reporting Sevices,Its basically for a non-programmer. and it says basically on the cover thats its for DBAs. so it was my fault. too simple and straightforward. but it was good for an introduction.
4,Solid Starter Book...,"I consider myself to be at a moderate knowledge base with regard to SQL Server, and I have worked with Crystal Reports and Microsoft Access reporting quite a bit. With this being my first interaction with Reporting Services, I felt Brian Larson's book was just the right pace for me. Numerous reporting examples are given, walking you through each step by step, resulting in some great reporting ideas (at least for me!) I found few if any errors in the text, and was able to zip through it cover to cover in a couple of days.I did also purchase the Wrox text, which I will be delving into next."
2,Lite Overview,I found this book too superficial. A lot of the focus was on basic SQL concepts which I'm already very familiar with. The book didn't even touch important features like reporting data from an Analysis Services cube.Maybe it's aimed at novice users; experienced developers should look elsewhere.
2,flawed premise,"The book context has some merit, but the basic premise is not substantiated. I don't find any merit to the claims of this book"
2,Bait,John Bevere wrote many good books. This one though sold well did not appeal to me than his other book.
5,"Oh, how I didn't know.","This book was required reading for our bible study. It didn't really like the title so I was apprehensive about reading it..that is until I got through the second page and knew it was written for me to read! This book is so telling. Oh how quickly we are offended and hurt by those who we care for in our family, church and in daily lives. We have a choice to let God teach us to let it go or let Satan to drop a gut bomb in us and let it eat us up from the inside out. I was being eaten up from the inside out and didn't even realize it!I thank God that I was directed to read this book, it was a life saver and eye opener! I have already shared it with a handful of people!"
5,This book will wreck you! It's so good!,I am not someone who likes to read at all. But a friend read part of this book to me so I had to order it myself and it has changed me so much. The Holy Spirit has revealed to me unforgiveness in my heart from my past that I didn't even realize I had! This book makes you actually dig into your Bible and read stories that you've read before in a different way that will change you. This is a MUST read. It is worth the money buying new so you can use the devotional supplement in it. I would recommend to ANYONE.Maria
4,very good,"I borrowed ""The Bait of Satan"" from a friend and liked it so much I wanted to buy my own so I can mark it up and make notes. It is helpful, but also you may find yourself 'offended' by reading it too. It takes some work and honesty with God to get through it. If you are willing to to that and learn to know how to deal with offenses the way Jesus want us to - then this is a great tool to use to look at yourself, grow and become a better disciple."
1,"took too long to get book.ordered it on jan.3,1013","still don't have the book yet, ordered on jan.3,1013 and here it is jan.22,2013 and still don't have it yet."
3,book,Interesting book that is highly focussed on how we should react to offenses. It is helpful to study this book in a small group rather than just reading it.
1,Bait of money grabbers,"This book is nothing but a huge conglomeration of words put together in order to make a buck. It has very little to do with the title. Just a bunch of Bible verses copied with a few ""insights'.It is typical of such writers to pump these things out to make money off of unsuspecting Christians. When I realized that the author was pushing it on the Pat Robertson show, I should have canceled my order. Nothing but a waste of my money and time. Disgusting!"
5,Spiritual surgery,"Not a book for the faint of heart. It gives ""denying yourself"" and being ""thick-skinned"" a whole new meaning. I definitely recommend it for anyone who truly wants to grow and lead."
5,Liberating information,"Forgiveness is for giving the quicker and deeper we forgive sooner we can breath again. If we hold in forgiveness it is like holding your breath, the bad air just stays inside of you constricting your life un till you die. Forgiveness is liberating and allows you to taste freedom with every breath. This book is the key to how to free your self from an unforgiving spirit."
3,Great principles with a lot of opinions,"The main theme of the book is great. It will be helpful to any Christian in gaining an understanding of the concept of offense. However, Bevere's choices of examples are perplexing to me. He uses Bible verses to justify his spiritual decisions, but some of them really lack biblical support. Some of the scripture he quotes to support his points are out of context, while more approriate scriptures are not utilized. I only recommend this book to mature Christians who have discerning spirit to tell truth from opinions."
5,The Bait of Satan,this book the Bait of Satan is wonderful it bring the truth to light and make you think on the thing at Satan put in you. It brings the truth in a new light
4,This is where the hottub time machine landed,"This movie is a lot of fun on the slopes 80s style, you know the deal, horny high school guys, hot girls, jerky preps, some sweet retro skiing and clothes and dancing some kind of climax, I think this and Hotdog are the 2 best 80's ski comedies."
4,"Cycling in the Hudson Valley, NY",We bought the book and used is exclusively to prepare and conduct bicycle trips in the Hudson valley. The trip length and route layout suites the occasional to average trained cyclist. The routes are using mostly side roads which makes the trips safe and pleasant. The indication of the mileage for each step make sure than no turn or remarkable viewpoint is missed. The abstract that precedes the detailed description of each tour is a good help to pick a route for the day. We highly recommend the book to anyone who has a interest in cycling in the Hudson Valley. Hopefully there will be more cyclists in the future as this area is great to be explored and enjoyed from the bicycle.
3,Cycling the Hudson Valley,"If you want to cycle in the scenic Hudson Valley, you will be more or less limited to this book because there are not a lot of other options. I'm not sorry I bought it... it's a great area to explore. But if you're an experienced cyclist who regularly tours with a cue sheet, you may find it frustrating. It's extremely detailed and wordy with the directions. Involves a lot more reading than I personally feel is safe to do while simultaneously navigating your bike. I wind up writing my own cue sheet w/just the turns and distances I can safely glance at. It would be better if there were a simplified version of this in the book one could just photocopy. I find it odd that this isn't included. Especially since it seems to be aimed at the moderately experienced tour enthusiast. Most rides are a bit more than a novice would attempt; typically 30 miles + over very hilly terrain."
2,an interesting and easy read but lacking in depth,"If you are looking for an interesting and emotional account of what Jesus meant to some of the women who followed him, you will enjoy this. If you are looking for true scholarship, this is not for you. It's a quick, easy read. You can probably finish it in a single sitting if you are an avid reader."
4,Not as nice as I had hoped,"I was thinking that the detail on the cover would have been more expensive looking - possibly fabric covered. This has a strip of ribbon glued on printed cardboard. I did like the information inside, however."
3,"Great book for administrators, but...","This is a great book if you need guidance in installing, configuring and maintaining your Sharepoint Portal Server, however it only touches very briefly on any development techniques involving the Sharepoint APIs and writing any of your own custom code.Compared to the other books on the market that deal with Sharepoint Portal, this is by far the closest one to what a developer would need, but it still leaves a lot to be desired. I am still waiting for that great Sharepoint technical reference manual that's made especially for developers. So far, none found."
4,"Nice Job, but time for update soon","I'll keep this book, but think the author need to update it pretty soon. Very nice detail before and after installation, not like lot of books on the market for Sharepoint. Things are changing, but still worth getting for me at least."
1,Old Version,"I was looking for a book on SharePoint 2003, Office 2003, etc but this book describes the earlier version of the software."
4,Totally Sweetness,"I thought this graphic novel was awesome. I love the R+1 scenes and I like the role Trowa plays. I like reading about Relena and the pilots. They're what the whole series is about. I also enjoyed the remixes because they shed a little light on things that might not be so obvious to everyone else, and they bring out things you may not have even noticed.Totally worth it. Buy it and enjoy."
3,"Blind Target is, well, blind...","Yaoi fans, do not be perturbed by the ""1+R"" in this manga! Blind Target was a radio drama before this artist made a visual story out of it, so that little tidbit never happened, anyway, because technically that was the artist filling in a part of the radio drama with no specified speech or action. Do not give up on this manga! Even though it isn't canon, it is still a wonderful addition to any GW fans' collection. I *loved* Episode Zero and Ground Zero and am awaiting Battlefield of Pacifists in the mail. I originally wasn't planning on ordering this manga because of the ""1+R"", but it's non-canon, and wasn't even said to have occured in the radio drama, so don't give up hope on a good story with everyone's favorite pilots!"
5,Gundum Wing Blind Target,"My Book Review Gundum Wing Blind TargetIt is about five Gundums and five Gundum pilots. Duo, Hero, Quatre, Wufei, Trowa use the Gundums for war. But the White Wang are trying to get them. I like this book. They can blow up things by using the Gundums. The author made forty nine episodes and made a book out of the forty nine episodes. Nobody eats worms in this story. There are some animals in this story. But you can't see their skeletons. NO, there are no bones in this story!"
1,You'll Be Disappointed,"Whose going to sit in front of a TV reading (and hearing it read) page after page on the screen of the entire unabridged text of one of the greatest books ever! I thought the DVD would be some form of dramatization, or ANYTHING, other than what it was. Better to READ the book, see the movie, or anything, but don't waste your money on this so-called ""DVD"". Ok,there ya go."
2,MaGill Punch,This punch was not of the quality of the one I use at work. It does not do through the things I need to punch like the other one I use. It works great for paper but not the tyvek paper I need to punch.
3,one good strut/one bad strut went out 30 days,"quick strut is a great product. quick can be installed around 20 mins..quick strut was sold at a great price for new struts,except when one goes bad after 30 days,[like mine has gone out,loud grinding when braking and turning] for be new you are limited return for replacement. might look locally for replacement.monroe quick strut is quality product."
1,"This isn't Dub, it's Dupe.","Hold on. I know you're excited. You saw ""members of At the Drive-In"" and started salivating like me. Well, I hate to tell you, but this CD is a mistake of the worst kind. There's no rock to be found at all. Hell, this isn't even good dub. If Tortoise were horrible, this is what they would sound like. Save yourself some money and let this one go. Trust me. I would only wish this on my most hated enemies."
4,truth and consequences (charmed),"cole calls phoebe saying he has to cancell there date as hes working late and so she goes to what seems an innocent date with another man, which is then ruined by cole who comes home early from work to suprise phoebe. he can not believe she would ever cheat on him and she can not believe that he would ever believe that she cheated on him. their escalating argument quickly highlights some fundamental trust issues they each harbor, but soon phoebe is trapped in the underworld and cole is forced to save her ... alone but pipers spell to make her connected to cole is endangering her can cole save phoebe without killing himsalf ... or piper ?an season 4 book which i think is worth buying !!!"
2,truth:not that interesting.consequence:wasted money.,"The book has a useless storyline.Although there was a few points of interest,true Charmed fans would NOT want to read this one again.I rarely buy the latest Charmed books because I just don't have the money but I decided to buy this one.Stupid idea."
2,The WORST charmed boook!!!!!!,I have read every charmed book to date and this was by far the worst book of them all. none of them used their magic it was a very basic book. cameron Dokey should be ashamed of this bookVERY DISAPOINTING
3,"Competent, uninspiring","Loomis played Chapel Hill style indie-rock reminiscent of bands like the Archers of Loaf, Superchunk and Small 23. Listeners familiar with 90s American lofi/indie will find no new ground broken here, and newcomers will find much better intros to the genre elsewhere (seek ye out: Pavement, Guided By Voices, Sebadoh, Archers of Loaf, Superchunk, Grifters). The vocals, melodies, and songwriting are not sharp enough to consistently lift Loomis above the level of generic indierock. Nevertheless, fans of this kind of music will likely find pleasant enough diversion here; Tiger|Meow Meow is a competent example of the genre with a handful standout tracks and enough quirks to keep things interesting."
2,Surviving the Survival Guide,"As always,Price and Walvoord were great teachers, however, the rest of the video,dispite the important subject, is difficult to stay with."
2,let down,"So I bought this coin a few weeks ago and still havent recieved it. Already making it over priced, at plus 14 plus 5 for shipping and handling its already over priced. The wait time on this coin is forever, i hope the coin is worth it. Ill let you know if i ever even see it."
2,free is better,"a empty three pound coffee can works just as good, just cut out top and bottomdrill or punch a couple of holes in the top and loop some wire through it for a handleIt will hold up for one season......... a little news paper and a dry pine cone or twoand you ready to grill"
2,Not this one!,"This was my first chimney starter. As others have noted it works fine for the first few uses... then the aluminum pop rivets holding the handle and holding the sides together melted! If this would have happened while pouring coals it could have been a disaster! I made a repair using 10-32 stainless screws, then gave it away and bought the Weber. The Weber is much more robust in construction. The additional bail handle is nice to aid in pouring the hot coals and the silicone handle holds up to weather and heat. Get the WEBER 7416 or the larger 87886!"
4,works well,does what it says works well the only reason that I gave it 4 not 5 is because it looks like it wont last as long as i thought
5,Peach Tree is the best album I've ever heard,"Peach Tree by Pollen is the best album I have ever heard. Peach Tree is a mood making album. It can cheer you up when you need it, pump you up for a big day, or lull you to sleep. It's intense lyrics can be hard to follow unless you listen to the album endlessly, but there is something about it's mysterious words that pull you in and wrap you up in the music. Peach Tree is the only ablum I have ever been able to listen to non-stop. I never tire of it."
4,Claire Weekes teaching is outstanding ... this book is part of that,"Claire Weekes helped me get over panic attaches during a bad time in my like. Hope and help for your nerves is better than this book; however, this book is part of the overall education and learning that is needed to get over this condition."
5,"Practical, readable, and empathetic","It's remarkable how the author describes what a panic disorder sufferer goes though in simple, non-psychobabble language. She explains strange aspects of panic disorder that none of the other literature seems to cover. Learning that these other strange symptoms are just part of the panic disorder package is extremely helpful to getting or progressing on the road to recovery."
4,Another winner from Claire Weekes,"This book along with Hope and Help for your Nerves, are extremely helpful for those of us who suffer from anxiety. This was was geared more for those suffering from Agoraphobia, but I still found many helpful phrases that I use when I am feeling anxious. My favorites are the ""Grandma's muffins"", the ""Long Lost relatives"", and the ""Missing Handbag"" illustrations. These little illustrations help one understand why symptoms linger, or return months or years after recovery and how to deal with them. Although I don't have agoraphobia, I did find it encouraging to read the journals of how some lifetime suffers of this condition were able to recover. I tend to avoid anxiety producing situations, but the way to recovery is by passing through these experiences, not by avoiding them, which only compounds the problem."
5,7 years after taking a history course (and using this book) I still have it on my bookshelf!,"Yes, After seven years of taking a history course (the only one I took in college) I still use and have this on my bookshelf. And yes, I did have Dr. Rampolla as a teacher, and I recommend her -- but I've used this book (and have colleagues use this book) at my workplace since graduating. As another reviewer mentioned, the concept of plagiarism can be a difficult subject to understand -- and I've used this book to help convey what has been wrong with papers in foreign countries, where concepts are different, but they are writing to a 'Western' audience.It's a small and comprehensive book -- there are bigger ones out there (that I also own) but this is the one I go back to each and every time first because it's easier to navigate and has what /most people/ need."
5,^_^,Rampolla is the diffinitive text on historical citation using the Chicago Manual of Style. They should be using this in high school history classes!
5,great guide by a great teacher,"Dr. Rampolla is one of my favorite teachers, but i'm not biased at all when it comes to this book. It is really good! It isn't too complicated but it doesn't leave things out. A good investment for any history class."
4,"Great for serving up bars, especially at this price","I received this spatula as a gift. Even though I have countless other spatulas I use this a lot. Why? It's much smaller than most spatulas making it perfect for serving up small items like bars. It also has a nice sharp edge on it so I can use it to both slice and serve up the bar. Is it absolutely necessary to own one if you have a lot of other spatulas? Probably not, but it is very handy when you need to slice and serve bars."
4,Automotive History,I Felt that this exciting cronicle of history to be well done. There were many interesting photographs that are not normally seen. good read
1,Junk,"I've had this printer for quite a while. The scanner stopped working and makes a horrible grinding noise when it is powered on with a ""scanner error 5"" message. Lots of people have had the same issue. The printer still works even with this error, and it prints sharp and clear. What a waste of my money for the multi-function aspect."
5,Excellent ring!,"My husband lost his heirloom wedding band in a triathlon, and we were looking for a modestly-priced replacement. We're thrilled with this item, ESPECIALLY for the price. It's a handsome ring!"
3,Extremely Enlightening,In this book it seems that sometimes Don Juan is more of a father than a teacher. It is also a great look into the Yaqui way of life and knowledge.
4,Unreality or lies?,"Current scholarly research has put to test the validity of Castaneda's claims that his experiences are true in this very enlightening tale of meso-american shamanism. Please realize that Castaneda's works may better serve as a metaphor for traditional culture versus modernism that actual truth.

1,Dangerous,"This book talks about Castaneda's use of the halucinogenic cacti named Peyote. It is dangerous to take mind altering substances, and something one should take ligtly.There are MUCH better and more importantly ""SAFER"" ways to go into an altered state of consciousness (fasts, thirsts, meditation, listening to a drumming tape, etc).This reviewer thinks Mr. Castaneda used too many mind altering substances because in this book, and in ""The active side of infinity"" Mr. Castaneda tells two different stories of how Juan Matus accepted to take Carlos as a student."
5,This book is absolutely mind blowing,Anybody who is interested in Native American shamanism and sorcery or halucinogenic plants has to read this book. This is Carlos Castaneda's diary of the time he spent with a Yaqui shaman learnig about peyote and the devil's weed. The descriptions of his journeys are vivid and memorable. This is a truly remarkable book.
5,"Your way, my way, the Yaqui way","Length:: 1:53 MinsBy reading this book you will perhaps begin to find YOUR way, for there is no need to believe it is the Yaqui way, as such, to make progress with your subjectivity."
5,what a great deal.,"What an awesome deal. I got my book and was very surprised see that the book was in perfect condition. Still in the plastic. I don't remember, but I believe I only paid like a buck and half. Last time I purchased this book I paid thirty five dollars for a used one. Very rarely do I ever get my money's worth nowadays. This was one of those rare occasions. Thanks amazon.!!"
5,Don Juan,Don Juan is more than a transcultural religous book. And it is more than just a retelling of a Yaqui belief system. Don Juan represents deep insight into the human experience. Don Juan is a profound exposition of generally known truths that has been put into a rich and vivid cultural setting. My family has been touched by his magic.
5,Recommended as teachings,"Castaneda's books were recommended to me by a Native American medicine woman I trust, who knows what he's talking about, who has met some people he learned from. She assures me that he received permission to write about his experiences and pass on Don Juan's teachings, something other European American writers have neglected to do. I am finding these books helpful, just beginning to understand what he's talking about. There's enough here to provide a lifetime of study."
4,One of the greatest books on Mexican Shamanism,"I read this book when I was quite young, and I still cherish it today. Unfortunatly, I recently found out that Castaneda died this year due to liver complications. He never let anyone take his picture or record his voice, making him as enigmatic as his characters. In this book, you will find many things that bring you to ponder over life's mysteries. This opens the box to the rest of Castaneda's books. A must read for dark, contemplative nights."
5,"""Deck the halls...""","Susan Allen did it again! Just when I thought I had found the end of the rainbow with her first book of crocheted Christmas ornament covers, she produced another book filled with new designs to cover Christmas balls. Like her first book, this one features festive photos of the finished ornaments and very easy to follow instructions to reproduce the ornaments for yourself. Her innovative method for covering the ornaments makes it easy to create lots of new Christmas decorations in no time.This book is is a portable size ready to slip into your craft bag to take with you anywhere. You'll be ready to sneak in a few more crochet stitches wherever you go. The compliments I receive on the finished ornaments keeps me crocheting more! You'll find this book to be a wonderful addition to your collection."
1,Crocheted Christmas Ornament Covers 2,"I purchased this book, and it's sister book because I was looking to expand on the ornaments I make each year for Christmas. I was greatly disappointed in both of them. I have made several of the covers before..but Not from these books, NOT by this author!!!!! They were made from a book I purchased in the late 1970's..different author, different publisher! Now, I don't know all that much about copyright law, perhaps it expired after 40+ years and the other author passed on or gave the instructions to her, and to be totally truthful, the patterns are just the a tiny bit different...a different size hook, change up the diameter stitches from 64 to 58, add or subtract a chain here or there, the original used plain old #10 string, Ms. Allen used Twiley's Goldfingering, with an offer and address to purchase. I am sure her publisher went through all the laws, and that this is legal, but I don't think it is ethical."
1,Read details before you buy,"I found this book very disappointing. I failed to read the description before I purchased this book. I didn't realize it was only 18 pages for $7.50. IN my opinion it is not worth that amount of money. Especially when you add 3.99 for S&H.;And to me, the designs were not that great."
4,Looks great,"I haven't tried it yet, but plan on using it for my ornaments next year. I have made ornaments for the family for 20 years and it gets harder every year to find nifty ideas. If the instructions are written correctly. I have found them in this book."
5,a brief description,"as a non-expert on music i can offer no great analysis of this recording nor can i compare it to other interpretations - since this is the only one i've heard. i could try describing it, but describing art is describing the indescribable.oh, what the heck-i'll give it a try:i found the performance and the songs thoughtful, high-minded and deeply beautiful. you may too."
2,Is pleasant singing enough in a masterpiece?,"Nearly every great baritone who specializes in lieder has recorded Schubert's last, sbulime collection of songs, Schwanengesang. With the likes of Terfel, Quasthoff, Fishcer-Dieskau, Olaf Bar, and Hermann Prey in the catalog, it's hard to justify a sturdy, pleasant performer like Michael Volle, who sings sturdily but without the slightest imagination. True, the price is low, but this is very great music, and I can't see that it's much of a bargain to hear it performed at a level devoid of inspiration. I make these comments not to run down Mr. Volle but out of curiosity over why Naxos, a powerhouse in classical recording, has assigned its Schubert cycle to thrid-rate singers when so many better ones would die to get the chance."
3,good first rabbit book,"This was my first rabbit care book. It is typical of the ones you find in pet stores etc. It is relatively thin and has a lot of glossy rabbit pictures in it and good basic care information. Since getting it, I have found it to be a little vague in some areas of rabbit nutrition, mainly the need for timothy pellets, the mainstay of the rabbit diet, and the evils of calcium in a rabbit diet. Other than that, it is a good, inexpensive, colorful rabbit book that I did enjoy reading."
1,This book was..um..different,"This was my first time reading one of Elizabeth Bevarly's books. I hope that all her other books are not like this one. I felt that the book was too wordy. Nothing exciting happened at the begining, the middle OR the ending! If you see this book in the store, don't pick it up; just walk away. I don't think that I am going to read any more of her books."
1,Biased From Start to Finish,This book only quotes leftist Israelis and Arabs. No mainstream Israeli historians are considered. The book takes a side while claiming to be an unbiased historical work.
5,More Than a Glimps of Historical Truths,"This book has helped me discover the source of the tragedy that Israel is living in. I encourage Jews, Christians, Muslims and others interested in peace to learn about the history of this great land from alternative sources as a prequisite to finding a way to live together."
5,nice package,"I have been using this instruction for about a month as a beginner. I really enjoy it. It comes with a nice ringbound book, which has easy to follow instructions for playing each song. It also has the music and tab. There are a few small errors in the book, but easy to spot and remedy.The dvd instruction is excellent.This course gets you right into playing music, which is a great motivation to keep going in the early learning stages when your fingers are not used to fretting chords and the progress seems slow.I am using this as a core to my learning, but also recommend a book or two on learning the guitar; to supplement this nice package. This course is designed to get you right into playing, but other beginner books can add depth to your study of the guitar."
5,Excellent guitar player and good teacher,"I bought this as a gift for my husband who wants to learn to play guitar now that he is retired and has the time. This is a good basic course for a beginner. It gets you playing simple music before you have time to be bored with all the necessary but not-so-exciting details that you have to learn. There's a lot of basic information in this 2-DVD set, enough to keep my husband busy for quite a while. I consider the price of this course to be money well spent."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,THIS VIDEO WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION COMPLETELY OFF BASE. I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.
5,make your own damn art,"this dvd box set is educational, inspirational, and entertaining. there are a bunch of documenteries that were entertaining and there are very informative interviews with veterans of film making. lloyd kaufman doesnt beat around the bush. i feel i got alot of major dos and donts on making a film.i am a musician with a real DIY aproach to releasing c.d.'s and touring, and while this box set is for making your own damn movie it can also be used as inspiration for any art one is involved in. so i would say buy this box set and go out and make your own damn art!!!"
1,Full of Hiss,"Don't buy this. The one I had was full of Hiss. Totally useless. The feel was very plasticy, don't even think about buying one"
2,Think before you buy,"I thought that the item would fit the camcorder automatically but it didn't. The shoe on the camcorder is to small for the size of the shotgun microphone... Bummer!!! Then the device covers important operation buttons like the zoom switch. So, you need extra extentable brackets and shoes for it to work. Mo money mo money... Bummer... My savings are lost and the microphone isn't being used... It's too inconveient to send it back."
3,Doers not work with some camcoders,Just got the smx-10 tonight only to find that the hotshoe bracket it too big for my Sony HDR-HC7. I checked around and no one told me about this BEFORE I bought this item. I ma trying to find a bracket that will work. So beware of this.
2,meh,The product failed to state which cameras it was compatible with. Sure I can plug it in. But when I need to use it I always have to rest it in an odd position. The difference between this mic and the camera one is barely noticeable. For the price I may be a little hard on it.
1,No on/off light. Short battery life.,"The quality of this mike is, as best I can tell, good. But it is very difficult to work with because:1) The battery life is short, maybe an hour or two.2) There is no light that lets you know that it is on. Or that lets you know thatthe battery is low. Or the absence of which would let you know that thebattery is dead and that you are recording nothing.If you are always videoing scenes you can retake, if you are always monitoring your videowith headphones or earphones, if you are happy to change the battery often. Then maybethis is a fine mike.Even with the short battery life, I'd be happy with the mike if it had an on light.Even without the on light I'd probably be happy if the battery life was 10-20 hours.But as it, I keep missing sound on shots."
4,works fine.,"I bought it to work together with my CANON VIXIA HF M30 Full HD Camcorder. I record concerts with it, mainly flute and piano. It gives you a clean sound, straight forward. Just point to the target and the majority of surrounding noise will desapear, keeping only what you want to hear. The only minus is the lack of bass. I would like it better giving more of the bass frequency. You can easily compensate it while editing the sound in any recording program like Sound Forge or Samplitude. I recommend it."
3,Ok for the price,"This mic was purchased to be used in a classroom environment with teenage kids, so I didn't want to spend a lot of money. The mic seems well constructed and sturdy. The sound recorded with it is ok. It is better than the sound off the camera mic, and doesn't pick up near as much motor noise and handling noise as the camera mic did. The one negative to the mic is the lack of a power indicator. I think a simple LED would remind people to turn the mic off after use. Other than that, this is a decent mic, and good bang for the buck."
4,Good addition to My Canon HV20,"This has been a really nice addition to my Canon HV20 camcorder. I like it because it provides far superior sound than the built in mic on the HV20 and it is not too bulky. I can leave it attached to my camcorder and still fit the entire rig in a relatively small camera bag (Tamrac Velocity 7x). I did not rate it a 5 because of the shockmount that it comes with is not the greatest. I substituted the Rode SM3 shockmount, which works much better. I highly recommend this combination. It has added a new dimension to my videos and my rig still remains highly portable."
2,"an improvement, but not for much","if you are planning on buying an external mic, chances are you are not happy with the built in mic that your camcorder has, in my experience buying this mic has an improvement but not for much.sound quality does improve, you dont get as much background noise with it, but you still get enough for it to be annoying. The directionality aspect of it is limited, you will still pick up some sounds coming from the back of the mic, but that is to be expected with directional mics, my problem with it is that it does not do enough to prevent sound from the sides, its just not good enough.for the price at hand, you might use it for some amateur filming, but if youre somewhat serious about sound quality, i suggest investing in a better mic."
3,Does an okay job,"I purchased this mic to use on my Nikon D7000. I have to say that I was expecting a lot more from this mic, that is compared to the on-board mic from the camera. This mic produces sound that is just a little clearer that then on-board mic. What I do like about the mic is that I can move it closer to my subject if needed, which then produces better sound. But I purchased it to use as a shot-gun mic, I don't want to hold it all of the time. I cannot recommend this mic if you are looking for really good sound from your hdslr."
5,Great Microphone,I use it with my laptop mic input.. during the video recording of our karaoke show. Mount it on my 3 unit bar on the tripod next to the cam that doesnt have a mic input. Really great recording sound .. very little back ground noise from behind.. perfect.
5,Big Difference,I used in my HD camcorder and also on skype calls. The sound quality is outstanding compared to other micro[phones I had used.
5,Video Review,This Mic is good if you're looking for a covenant way to getting better clearer audio. At this price point there aren't many that are better than this mic. Here is a video review i made for this product: [...]
2,Not impressed,Agree with others in that you can't tell when it's off or on and it doesnt seem to have a noticeable effect on sound quality when recording.
1,Terrible,I bought this cheap mic thinking it may be better than the onboard mic for a dSLR T2i. It wasn't. Do not buy this product unless you want to waste money. The white noise is ridiculous and loud on both the wide and direct sound settings. May as well use the onboard mic.
2,Worse than built-in mic,"I bought this mic to use with my Rebel t3i and it is worse than the internal mic in the camera when shooting in a quiet room. It picks up more background noise and echo than the internal mic, which is bad especially for an interview or an indoor dialogue scene. I have stopped using the mic and have resorted to shooting with the internal mic and throwing it into adobe soundbooth to get rid of some of the noise."
4,It does the job,"To make it short, I've have attached it to my Canon 5D Mark II and still picks up the inner noise sounds from the moving parts, the mic still works even if I turned it off!!.The build quality is good and it is very light and short in length around 20cm. Sound quality is away better than the built-in mono mic. Its a little bit expensive."
4,Good sound for the money,"If you are looking to upgrade your standard video camcorder microphone with a stereo one, this may be the one for you. I've recorded my band with it and have gotten good results. It isn't the most amazing sounding stereo mic ever made or anything but it gets the job done. Don't mistake this for a shotgun, Azden has another offering for that use (SM1X?). I have only used it indoors and haven't tested the windscreen."
2,i do not recommend,"I bought this for my canon vixia hf 20 for better sound quality and I was excited when it came in email, but when I plugged it in to the camera it had so much static noise that I was shocked. It seriously sounded like construction site, when the place I was in was super quiet. Anyways so after like 10 minutes of struggle, I finally got it to sound normal. But I was disappointed to find out there was no difference between using this and the internal microphone. So, if you have canon vixia hf 20 I say you don't need this product. I wish I invested in something with better quality rather than buying something because it was cheap."
4,It works a little better than camera's onboard mic,This mic can pick up clear audio from far distance than camera's own builtin mic. For the price it is a good product.
4,Mic review,"Worth the money. If you need a mic that gives reasonable performance at a low price, this is it. Consider this mic if you need a backup for the more expensive units as well."
2,WARNING...,"DOes not have a battery / ON indicator light so you will never know if you accidently leave it on or when the battery dies, until you review the footage after the fact. you have to guess as to when to replace the battery."
4,Good Purchase,"This is the first shotgun mic I've purchased, so I can't compare it to others. However, the sound quality in my video is much better than with the onboard mic on my Canon HV-20. It almost eliminate the voices and sounds coming from BEHIND the camera, and the sounds generated when I touch the camera to focus or change the menu are greatly diminished.If you are hoping to pick up or isolate sounds from far away (like in the NFL films where you can hear the quarterback calling plays) then keep looking. But if you want to record your kids at dance recitals, church plays and such, then this is a good addition."
4,Not as bad as I thought it would be,The wide-angle lens on my Canon HF200 is blocking the built-in mic just below the lens causing some sounds not being recorded the way I wanted them to be. So I've been looking for an external mic I could place on and off camera.I've read reviews and watched youtube videos about this mic and I wasn't convinced if this is the mic I want to use for my camera. But the size and price seem to be good enough for me to give it a go so I purchased it.The first time I tested this mic at home recording some TV footage I wasn't impressed with the hisses and lack of low end. I wasn't too sure if it's any better than the built-in mic.Yesterday I had an opportunity to test it out during my band practice. Lo and behold! Suddenly videos of my band practising sound so much better than before. Bass sounded awesome. I know there are better mics out there. I've never tried any other mics before so I can't compare but based on yesterday's results I'm quite pleased.
3,all right,"Product was great for baking the 18-hour Sullivan Street bread but the lid does not have much to grasp on to. It dropped and broke. Other than that, it was all right. It got dirty on the outside and was difficult to clean, but I cleaned it with baking soda and lots of slow scrubbing with a soft non-scratch pot cleaner."
5,japanese pop grunge,"gumdrops is a very good obscure japanese pop grunge band. check out the song ""flow."" the frontwoman sings in english. i can make out only half the words, but its the ""flow"" of the song that makes it catchy and pleasant to the ear. the rest of the cd is very good as well."
2,Useless,The book seems well-organized but the entries are incomplete. It is not difficult to find some well-known angels are not listed in this book.Looking for a dictionary of angels? Look elsewhere.
3,Not Biblically acurate.,"I have just begun reading this book. It is very interesting; however, it is not biblically acurate. On page xiii the author refers to ""the protection and encouragement of human beings."" He uses the scripture of Ps. 91:10-11: ""He will give his angels charge of you, To guard you in all your ways. On their hands they will bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone."" This indeed is a wonderful scipture; but, it is not refering to people. It is refering to Jesus Christ out Lord and savior. Don't take my word for it read Luke:4 9-13. If you are going to qoute scipture try and use it in the context that it was intended and written. Thank you very much."
3,Incomplete,"The angel of air (Chasan or some books spell as ""Chassan"") is not listed in this book. This angel is mentioned in some books on evocation of angels.I do not think that this book is good enough to be called an encyclopedia on angels. Perhaps just the name ""Encyclopedia"" to make it sell better??"
5,Something to restore your faith,"This is the book to read if you want to recapture your faith inthe medical profession. Dr. Bonadio's compassion for his patients isextremely moving; at several points in the narrative, I found myself on the brink of tears (all right, so I sobbed! who could help it?). Of particular interest to me was the chapter on the autopsies and how Dr. Bonadio learned respect for the human body and for the force of death. I also found the story of how he decided to become a doctor--through his father's own feelings of failure at being ""just a janitor""--a very touching tale. It went a long way to explain how this physician has maintained a sense of selflessness. I felt privileged to read about his quest to find meaning in seemingly senseless and traumatic events, such as the death of Julia. Read it (hopefully before your next scary visit to the emergency room) and find inspiration."
1,poor quality,This item came with a crack through the plastic ball drawer. Five of the laminate pieces were badly scratched. This is a piece of junk. I plan to return if it can't be put together adequately.
4,"Low tech, but does the job.","Well, I felt a little silly paying about $20 (with shipping) for 2 pieces of plastic, 2 bra hooks, and some rubber bands. However, the kit does work, and does allow you to pump hands free. One word of caution - if you use Medela's Quick Clean steam bags to clean your pump parts, TAKE THE HANDS FREE PLASTIC SLEEVES OFF before throwing the bag in the microwave! Otherwise, they warp and don't fit right."
1,Ridiculous design,I bought this kit because I thought it would be easier than using the Easy Exressions halter (which works great by the way). The halter pulls over your head and you have to remove your shirt to put it on (I didn't know that they made a zip-up bustier!)Unfortunately fiddling with rubber bands and hooks on the Medela Pumping Free kit takes more time than removing your shirt and pulling the halter over your head. Then when you finally get the things attached they don't sit right and you have to fiddle with them during the whole pumping session anyway. Who has time for that?
4,not your normal CD,"Two things: This is not the CD for you if you want to sing along or memorize all the words or dance a jig. The music and lyrics are, on the other hand, beautiful and creative, with a feeling of bards from long ago. Basically it's great, but definitely should be previewed on youtube or elsewhere before purchased."
4,Y[e]s!,"Flighty, eccentric, theatrical, filmic, ethereal, grandiose and playful, Ys is the best album Fiona Apple never made."
1,disappointing studio version,"I mainly bought this album because of the song ""sawdust and diamonds"" which i had only heard the beautiful ""live version"" on youtube. Turns out the studio version is a lesson on how you should NOT record a song.The equalization of this song is appalling. You can barely hear the intricate harp playing during most of the song because the high-frequency signals are saturated while the low-frequency signals are muffled. All of this making the song a great big blur with shrieks.I'm honestly truly disappointed."
1,NO NO NO!,She sounds exactly like emiliana torini! and the girl form Cocorosie! and Bjork....but far less greater than all of them.....this is a disappointing album...like something special kids in a music therapy class would make....horrible.
1,Oh my God!!!,"After listening to this whatever it is, music it ain't, I was struck by how much Newsom reminds me of Florence Foster Jenkins. Apparently FFJ has been reborn! Oh well, at least Bjork can sing! Now I have some more examples for my school and church choirs as to ""how not to sing""!"
2,There was a band in the 60's called the Shaggs...,"...who put out an album that is perfect. The Shaggs were recorded at that moment in time when their ouevre was perfection. They couldn't play their instruments that well yet and their singing was unprofessional. The songs were scraps of pure teenage whimsy. Joanna Newsom is coming from a totally opposite direction from the Shaggs. She is produced to the nth degree with layers of sound and songs that go on forever. Newsom is perfection in apposition to the Shaggs. In Newsom's case, perfection is discordant but banal. Sterile and rehearsed. Dead air gone bad. Granted, she is a novelty and a striking one. I'll give her that. But I think Van Dyke Parks has better things to do. Like reunite The Shaggs and get Steve Albini to engineer the CD. Now, that would be perfect."
2,Regina Spektor rip-off,"I've read rave reviews of this album in at least 3 different publications.When I finally heard the album my first thought was that she sounds just like Regina Spektor. Not just the vocal ticks, but also the quirky lyrics and melodies. If you like this album, check out Regina Spektor's Soviet Kitsch."
1,My ears are bleeding...,"I heard a piece on NPR highlighting this CD while riding the train home after work. I almost wet myself with laughter - this has got to be a SNL skit gone wrong. To think that this was one of the ""Best CD's of the Year"" by NPR listeners made me embarrased to be one of them. Wake up people - new and intersting does not mean GOOD. YIPESSS!"
2,"Ouch, my ears hurt.","Talented instrumental work and interesting production but vocals and lyric are really quite poor. JN's warble is ""yelpy"" and too piercing. It's painful to listen to this CD. I don't really understand what the big hoopla is about."
5,Simply wonderful!,This is certainly one of the highlights of the year for me. Simply astounding album that I believe many will come back to for years to come!!
5,Amazing!,"I didn't like this album when I first heard it. It may sound odd, but I was actually bothered by how refined her voice had become. Then one day, I finally decided to stop being such an elitist and give it a listen. As it turned out, I had been missing out on five of the best songs ever written. Each song is its own epic tale laid over some truly amazing Kora rhythms, quiet melodies, and beautifully written orchestral accompaniment. I can't wait to see what she'll come up with next."
3,Most entertaining reviews on Amazon!,I loved THE MILK-EYED MENDER but haven't listened to this album enough to give it a fair rating -- I just got it today. Thus the 3 stars.But I just spent half an hour reading these reviews to my partner and laughing out loud at many of them. Great stuff!Now everyone get back to work.
4,epic mushroom music,"SO Newsom has abandon Pop, for this record at least. There are no verse chorus verse songs here. Well to be honest there never were, but the Milk eyed member her previous album, at least ""appeared"" to have a pop sensibility.Having seen Newsom perform the album in its totality before actually hearing it, helped. I knew what to expect. What we get is an epic album. Perhaps best thought of as one piece of music. It really is impossible to think of this a s seperate songs. Like a long story you are arrested by the music and the words.Yes it is self indulgent, and for those who have a short attention span, look elsehwere. This is a ""difficult"" album one many will hate. One many will also adore. This may catapult Ms Newsom to heady places, it may end her career. In the end you have to applaud her for having the courage to actually amke this album. Clearly her debut discs only hninted at this.I urge anyone to see her live, live she is so much better than on CD."
2,Overly ambitious,"Moments on here of a personalized whimsy you won't find elsewhere, although over-arranged, lumbering epics only highlight a contrived nature."
2,maybe if you are in the mood,"Okay, so I could enjoy this cd under certain circumstances....the right mood strikes on a long road tripi'm somewhere out in the woods and feeling cheesy in a renaissance sort of wayi'm drunk and incoherent.otherwise, it's fine for about 5 minutes. this cd made me tense and irritated. i listened to the first two songs and had to go smoke a cigarrette to relax."
1,Freezing clock display,"I have had the same problem. I've had the unit for about 10 months. After about the first 2 months, it started to freeze up. I have to reboot it by removing the batteries and unplugging it."
3,review,We love this product - however the display occasionally goes garbled and frozen for no reason. The only solution is to unplug and remove the battery backup and restart the unit. Not sure what the cause of this is but otherwise it is nice unit with good audio.
2,"Looks cool, but not very functional...","This product is incredibly annoying! The speakers make ugly crackling noises when they're not playing music. They'll be silent for hours, and then, at 3 in the morning: EEE-EEEE-CHHHHHH-ACKKKKK. Very startling, and very very annoying. I generally keep it unplugged so it doesn't make these noises in the middle of the night-- which renders it quite useless for using as an alarm clock.Also, I have an iPod 5G, and can never wake up to the playlist I want to wake up to. I've tried and tried to set it to the song I want it to play, but it ALWAYS moves back to my main song list and plays one randomly. I'm told that 3G iPods work perfectly with this speaker system, but that doesn't exactly help me...The two stars are pretty much just because the thing looks cool on my bedroom table."
3,clunky interface,The interface is far more complex than it should be to se the alarms or turn the ipod on for listening.It does sound good and I especially like that it has a sub-out port I added a cheap sub and it really makes a huge difference in sound quality and volume.
1,"SUBSTANDARD RADIO, SUBSTANDARD CUSTOMER SERVICE","DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!I have tried with 2 different units to get any FM reception whatsoever. All I get is static. When I plug my 19.99 10-year-old Sony Dream Machine into the same plug at the same location, I get static-free reception on at least 10 different FM stations. JBL customer service maintained over and over again that it's not their fault; that their unit works at their headquarters, so it must be the fault of my house or its location; that they do not give refunds (nor even a toll-free number for customer service); that they can't explain why other brands deliver acceptable reception but theirs does not.Do yourself a favor--buy a Klipsch, iHome, anything but JBL."
4,Germanic origins of English warriors.,"Extensive coverage of the Germanic warriors that came first as mercenaries hired by the Romano-Britons to fight the Picts and Celts - the Anglo-Saxons.Covers their military culture, weapons, tactics, attitudes, mores, etc. of these men. In some ways the Anglo-Saxon ""hearthmen"" reminded me of samurai in respect to their willingness to go to their deaths when a lord was killed in battle or by treachery. This work shows how they changed over time in response to internal and external challenges.I thought it was a very good treatise on the subject. My only criticism is that it is sometimes dry and almost fails to hold the reader's interest."
5,An Excellent Read!,"Richard Maurer's new book chronicles Powell's second expedition through the eyes, words, and illustrations of Fred Dellenbaugh - a 17-year-old boy from Buffalo, NY who, along with some rowing experience on the turbulent Niagara River and a facility for drawing, had the gumption to make his dream come true. This story is very well written and quite compelling and will appeal to those who love adventure stories set in the Old West. The photographs and illustrations are remarkable. My hats off to the author!"
3,Spoiler alert,"This is a fun read, even though (or maybe because) the writing is a little crude and lurid. It paints a vivid picture of the early 70s setting, with religious cults, new agey personal transformation movements, hippies, free love, class conflict, and identity issues. And then it adds a revenge of the nerds twist to this heady mixture. I thought it was interesting that the two characters who committed the worst crimes were the ones who found redemption"
4,Very poetic,"This book was absolutely fascinating in its own way. It was told in alternating first person POV from the four main characters, each chapter using a different narrator. This sounds like it would be confusing, but it ultimately was not. In fact, the author successfully alternated each character's ""speaking"" style enough that the reader was able to tell who was the narrator just from that. The writing itself was also very poetic. Some entire passages seemed to be more like poems than prose. My main complaint with this book is that it was intensely homoerotic. Even though only one of the main characters, Ned, was gay, a tremendous amount of conversation was spent talking about homosexual sex. For the reader not expecting it, that could be more than a little offputting. However, this is still a good book. It's gothic at times, dark, humorous, and all around interesting."
1,Disturbing...,"The premise of this book is very interesting. The story itself tends to suck you in so that you feel like you HAVE to finish it. But even so, I found this book disturbing. Be warned, if you read this book you will have some very detailed homosexual images pumped into your brain. I really wasn't all that interested in hearing about Ned's fantasies concerning Oliver's ""bum."" If Silverberg were to have left out all the detailed sex in this book (and especially the homosexual junk), it would have turned out to be a decent book. Of course, that would have cut out about half of the book!"
4,A road trip into Hell,"Other Amazon reviewers have correctly knocked this novel for its utilitarian depictions of women. I would add that Ned, the gay element in the foursome seeking immortality in the Arizona desert, reads like a rancid leftover from the self-hating homosexuals in ""The Boys in the Band."" Even so, ""The Book of Skulls"" is a master class in sustained tension and mystery. The drawback in this particular quest -- of the foursome, two will live forever, but one must commit suicide and another must be murdered by his fellows -- is an irresistible setup, and the payoff is genuinely surprising. One of Robert Silverberg's best novels, in a class with ""Thorns"" and ""Dying Inside."""
4,an American journey,"The Book of Skulls presents a realistic portrayal of the thoughts of four young men trying to figure out themselves and life.The story is skillfully revealed through the alternating views as the four main characters journey in a car to find a ""fountain of youth"".I ended up considering my own journey for identity and purpose, and I have come to make meaning of life.It gradually shifts to challenge our thinking on what we do to stay alive and live well (I laughed to see hints of many fads for healthy living that have popped up in the 90's in this novel from 1972.)This isn't scary, not really what I think of when I think of science fiction, but it becomes surreal.Quite cerebral and very fun!"
5,Life Changing,"After reading this book and following the simple examples outlined in it for the last seven months, GOD has started to move tremdously in my life. HE has brought me closer to HIM and is doing some awesome inner healing in my life. The Holy Spirit has given me more 'gifts'. It just has been incredible all HE has done for me. Now I can really look forward to each new day and all that the LORD has for me."
3,A compilation of 5 popular Wham! songs,"The VHS tape includes 5 popular Wham songs:Freedom I am your man A different corner The edge of heaven Where did your heart goIt starts with a 2 minute description of Wham's thoughts before their concert in China. They really did not know what to expect, etc, etc.I personally thought that the video would contain Wham's ""Final' concert in Wembley Arena in London, in 1996 so I was somewhat disappointed."
4,"Fantastic overview of serious, contemporary art","This is a excellent guide to what is often NOT written about in east coast periodicals. Filled with beautiful reproductions of current work. The writing is a bit uneven, but is generally very readable and not filled with art jargon. A very good overview for anyone who goes to galleries and/or is interested in any form of contemporary art."
2,Nice at begining but later rip,I purchase 2 sets of these about 6 months ago and they are very nice and confortable - but unfortunately after time of usage - this boxer shorts rip. This was importantly to me enough to find my order now and write this review.
5,change of mind!,"my boyfriend hated silk boxers but after i got these for him, he absolutely loved them!"
5,Fantastic Silk Boxers,This is the best deal that I could find for the quality. I plan on getting more soon. Other silk boxers I have purchased in the past are of inferior quality and make. Royal Silk delivers!
1,VERY UNHAPPY!,I ordered these boxers for my husband's birthday (September 11th). They sent size Large in error and they have yet to send me the correct size as they promised when I called. The box is still sitting here in my office waiting for them to send the Size Medium boxers and the return information. I have called and left messages but recived no further response.
3,3 silk boxers,"the colors are nice, the size is correct, the price is averagemy husband was a bit disappointed because the boxes are not soft and pliable. they have a bit of a stiffness to the fabric so they werent as comfortable as he had hoped for"
5,Way to go Pat Flagg!,"Small town coastal Maine: a classic American location. The locals notice that a genteel retired woman, living alone, is becoming a recluse. And as Amy Cave fades out, another woman, younger, stranger, fades in. She's over-endowed and men can't keep their eyes off her. Where did she come from? What's she doing here? By the time Amy finally goes missing, Samantha -- Sam -- has become all too conspicuously present. It doesn't take law enforcement officials long to put two and two together. And that's just the first layer to be peeled off the onion.It's a great story and a true story. And our narrator, a reporter for the local weekly, obviously has a great time telling it. I lapped it all up and wanted more. Encore! Encore!"
4,An amazing true story,Excellently written - definitely tucks you in the small town of Maine. Bizarre things happen no matter where you are. May Amy Cave rest in peace.
1,Severely lacking,"I imagine if you are familiar with the town or the people, this would be a reason to read this book. But, having read numerous true crime novels, I can tell you this one is severely lacking. Not only do we know very little about the background of Amy Cave, but we know next to nothing about the killer. There was nothing in this book that could not have been found in newspaper articles at the time. A real true crime book would delve into the personal histories of each. We hear fleetingly of Amy's loneliness, her change in behavior towards some of her friends, but its never followed up on, explained, or tied to anything in the book.As for Sam, there was nothing on her background as to why she dressed as a female, or even more importantly what drove her to kill Amy. In fact, we know little to nothing about her at all. Unbelievable.Don't waste your time with this book, there are so many gaps its hard to mention all of them."
3,Disappointed,"I guess ""I would have had to have been there"" to appreciate this book. As it is, I never really identified with Amy Cave. Ms. Flagg makes many mentions of photography, cameras, dark rooms, pictures of convicted person, but does not share one photo with her readers. Photographs may have enhanced Amy's story for me."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,"""Blue Country Heart"" is absolutely outstanding! A great collection of musicians producing an awesome piece of work. In my humble opinion, Jorma's music was made for this combination of instruments. For it's great selection of songs and magic blend of strings and vocal harmonies, ""Blue Country Heart"" deserves to win a grammy, no questions asked.Jorma, thank you. ""Blue Country Heart"" is a wonderful gift and this particular fan couldn't be more grateful. Keep it coming!"
5,Go Jorma!,"This is Jorma's best CD since the original acoustic hot Tuna -- seriously -- he picks a small, solid band, and they just cut loose for 13 songs. No posing or strutting, just an hour of listening to one of the greatest guitarists ever play his current favorite songs with a few friends. The playing rivals Doc Watson, but the melancholy tone is all Jorma's. Great stuff."
4,Satisfied,"I've had a set of these for about a year now, and I have had no problems. The valves show no indication of wear or leaking. No problems with the finish. The connections are a bit short, and that made install a challenge -- they were just long enough to get through the 3/4"" countertop, so I had to cut out the underlayment."
5,Kingston Faucet,The products came ahead of schedule delivery date. Was in perfect condition and looked great. Installed easily and looks far more expensive then its price. We are very happy with the purchase.
5,Useful beyond measure,"All of these books titled ""Problems and Solutions on (subject): Major American Universities Ph.D. Qualifying Questions and Solutions"" are invaluable tools for a physics graduate student, in my experience.One criticism: The index for this particular book is nonexistent. I am writing my own in my copy of the book.If you are a student in physics, I suggest that you get your hands on these books."
4,If you're a grad student...,"If you're a grad student, you'll probably use this book twice: Once when studying for your qualifying exams, then again when you're writing problems for your courses to prepare future students for their qualifying exams. There are many exercises, the first part focusing on Thermodynamics, and the second on statistical physics. Beware, however, as not all solutions are correct. As with any book, work out the problem yourself, then compare, and never take the word of a solution manual. On the whole, however, there tend to be many repetitive problems."
5,Making Latex Clothes,"This book has information and some patterns for latex, I have not made any of them yet so i cannot say if the construction details, patterns or products described are good. But it appears to me to be really well done and simply presented for someone who is not familiar working with latex.I have this book as a resource in my costume design library. The latex material works well in applications that need strong compression and a different look."
4,Needs descriptive label on battery,"My battery had only a part number written on it. It did not have a '+' mark to show which end should be connected to positive.I had to put a voltmeter on it in order to determine which end was which.There also was also no voltage or capacity (ma-hr) listed.The installation went fine, it took a charge and seems to be working as expected."
3,"Colors great, but not too sturdy","I love floursack towels and the colors on these are stunning and don't run in the wash. However, one gentle wash cycle and the seams unravelled in several spots.Pretty, but apparently not made to last. I'm no seamstress, but I assume they will continue to fray with washing. Oh, well."
5,simple and well made,Grat design and simple but not too simple. They look great with minis in summer and perfect for work when you can't bothered wearing heels. Love them. I love the wide front so they don't give me blisters in summer.
4,"A must for any fan, new or old of Delerium's works","Volume 1 Archive covers the best 4 albums in my opinion of early Delerium works.'Faces, Forms & Illusions' - 9/10'Morpheus' - 9.5/10'Syrophenikan' - 10/10 The track Embodying is a absolute standout as this song as dark chants with a strong ambient beat. This album has many great songs on it and was Delerium at its best.And look out for the song 'Drama', if not the best song by Delerium is in the top 5."
1,worst delerium stuff,"I fell in love with Delerium's special atmosphere. I loved voices and sensations of Karma, Poem and Chimaera. I tried but I hardly reach the end of this cd without falling asleep. it's not Delerium's music, it's just a collections of ideas of sounds used to perform and create all the rest. I didn't like it."
1,Tired old platitudes,"What qualifies this woman to arbitrate what is and isn't good for kids? She seems to have the same mentality as the movie makers who think kids are special idiots that need pap for entertainment. There is nothing new here, and she has no gift for verbal orchestration. Roger Ebert, a childless man, offers more insight into what would or wouldn't be appropriate for MY kids."
2,It is my least favorite of Molly's CD's.,"It was too much rock. Molly is a wonderful blues singer. She is great when she does a Patsy Cline song. She doesn't need to yell, just sing the way we know she can."
3,An Overview Of Lash's Research,"I always find Lash to be an interesting person. This effort gives a brief overview of his research. I did not find it to the best representation of his work. I am currently reading his book ""Not In His Image"". Well written and very interesting thus far.The issue I have with the production is the frivolous graphics used while Lash is talking. It seemed like a production for children as opposed to adults. The graphics are eye candy without any relevance to what Lash is talking about. I found them distracting.To get a good intro to Lash check out his interviews on Red Ice Radio. They are much more in depth."
3,Great to meet you but . . .,"This video is a great introduction to Lash and the Sophia story, though it leaves much to be understood. Not a place to start if you are delving into the subject matter. You quickly get confused."
3,Phillip dick vs nag hammadi,The author references Phillip Dick more than he does the original gnostic textsHe has quite a radical interpretation of the genesis of the earth which is not consistent with gnostic textsGnostics devalue creation completely: the world is the abode of archons not a piece of Sophia!The author equates Malchesnedik with Gd: he is actually metatron not the Jewish GdAbsent is the Father of the Aeons: Sophia is the only divine force of interestThe Archonic plan is quite logical not totally random as impliedHe alludes to sexual synergy as salvation but does not define what that means
3,Nice and informative,This book gave me some good ideas about how to deal with a low-sodium diet! The recipes are creative and give the reader hope.
2,Melinda,"I bought this book after reading several reviews which made it sound great. However when I got it home and started trying the recipes I found them difficult to follow, some with missing steps, and they all had so many ingredients they were just plain difficult to make. The end results so far have been tasty, just time consuming to prepare. I also bought 'The No-Salt Cookbook: Reduce or Eliminate Salt Without Sacrificing Flavor' by David C. Anderson, Thomas D. Anderson which has been an easier cookbook to use and has a better layout for the recipes."
5,Timely and comprehensive book,"Finally, some realistic advice about low salt cookingfrom someone who has compiled and created tasty andworkable food. Great source suggestions also.This is an often overlooked part of supermakets, in oursalt dependent society."
4,Best Recipe book for my DH,"I ordered this book for my husband who just got high blood pressure. This is exactly the book that he was looking for. The first few chapters are very informative. I can't wait to try some of the recipe like the home made pasta sauces, bread, etc. The author also gives you an idea on where you can buy some of the ingredients that you are not familiar with."
3,No salt lowest sodium cookbook just okay,"I bought this with high expectations but have rarely used it. It has plenty of bread recipes but when it comes to comfort style, downhome food,,,,I just can't find the ones that suit me or my family...we are not into the types of food you get at a heath food store or any of those special grain type things like hummas, tofu,,etc...since he is very concerned about low fat,,,he puts applesauce instead of oil, and it has me trying to figure out how to put oil back in. If you are from the South,,these yankee type foods will not make you happy...compotes, etc. There could be a much better cookbook written for the Southern taste...if you are not from the West or the South,,,you will probably like the food. There are also, a lot of errors in it..which you have to go to his website to make corrections in your book...too much trouble for me...I want a book I can trust..."
2,No salt but no taste either.,"After my recent heart attack, I've been trying to make changes in my diet, so I purchased this one. Eek. Recipe after recipe fell flat on its face-- near inedible stuff. Try the series of cookbooks from the American Heart Association instead."
2,Not for diabetics,"I don't say that you shouldn't buy this book. I did, and I got a few ideas from it. But the vast majority of recipes are unsuitable for diabetics. Sugar, honey, flour, potatoes,pasta, fruit juice, cornmeal and other foods that are dangerous to diabetics abound."
3,No pictures,"This is probably an individual concern, but I prefer a cookbook with pictures. I have noticed that most low sodium cookbooks have few (if any) illustrations. It might be silly, but some people want to see what the finished product should look like. Also, the absence of photographs made this cookbook as bland as a low sodium diet."
5,A valuable resource,"After reading many references and cookbooks on low sodium, this book has become one of my primary references. The informaiton provided covers some areas not addressed in other references and the recipes are both practical and do-able. The results of using most of the recipes have been very satisfactory in both flavor and appeal.I highly recommend the dill pickling recipe for dill pickles and pickling vegetables.As a long time breadmachine baker I found confirmation of my approach to making no-salt-added bread and some useful aditional ideas.Anyone having to learn how to live with and enjoy a low sodium lifestyle will find this book a very useful resource."
3,The No Salt Lowest Sodium Cookbook,"Many, many recipes. Good tips. Just have not found a recipe that tasted good yet..perhaps have not hit on the right one yet. Many more to try!"
4,Life without Salt,"I found this book to be an excellent source for ideas on avoiding sodium. I have long cooked without using additional salt, but was amazed at the sodium content of everyday staples and found this book to be very helpful with recipes and other tips. I will be reading this book a lot in the days to come."
2,Errors make recipes difficult to execute,"The book contains numerous interesting recipes in which sodium and salt are creatively avoided. HOWEVER, a significant percentage of the recipes I have tried have errors or ambiguities that make the recipes difficult to execute. Specifically, the recipe instructions are frequently inconsistent with the ingredients list. It seems clear that not all of these recipes have been verified by independent cooks working from the book. An experienced cook can probably figure out how to make the recipes work, but an inexperienced cook will be frustrated when he/she runs up against one of these problems in the middle of preparation.Another cautionary note is that many of the recipes are rather bland. Again, an experienced cook can figure out how to spice things up, but an inexperienced cook may end up with a meal that falls short of expectations."
4,"Great Nutrition Info, Good Mix of Recipes","I really like the nutrition discussion in the beginning of this book. It has helped me understand the basics for meal planning. The recipes are good, and I've tried a few and found them quite nice. The family-sized servings are great for sharing. Kind of a ""covert"" way to sneak low-salt cooking to friends and family. I'd recommend this book for anyone starting out with a low-salt diet."
3,Informative,I order this book after my husband was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in search of recipes. There are a lot of recipes in the book the only problem is that the ingredients aren't things that were in my pantry. I had to spend about $200 for spices and such in order to cook. I ended up doing a good job on my own. But the book did give me a sense of direction.
3,not really for aussies,"After converting everything from pounds and ounces etc it is a straight forward cook book, some recipes are good and easy, others are bland and its a bit of a cop-out when he says ""get some mama's {name brand )low salt cheese and some low salt corn-chips from big daddys {name brand} you get the picture...other wise its good for beginner chefs like me."
4,Interesting design standard HGUC quality,This is a Titans Test Team variant from the Universal Century timeline. Mecha design is typical UC style. Being a High Grade kit it does not have an inner frame but the external detailing is very good. A coat of paint will help give the kit a realistic feel but just like all HGUC kits major components are cast in correct color. Foil stickers and dry transfer decals come with the kit. Design features that stand out are the large shield and beefed up legs. I think it looks good :)
4,"Beautiful, but power switch problems","Apple's flat panels are truly works of art. The picture and contrast are excellent; however, when I use it in a 90 degree room (most of the summer), the power switch constantly activates itself. This used to put the computer to sleep while I was using it, but now I can disable the sleep feature in the Energy Saver control panel. Note: I bought this almost a year ago, so Apple may have corrected the problem."
2,Uninstalled after Update Went Berserk,"I liked the idea that Counterspy monitored for spyware in the background, as well as providing a spyware check to be run periodically. Counterspy seemed to work fine, although running spyware scans seemed slow (about 20 minutes for 20 MB).Then the software update 1.5 appeared to be downloaded. After I downloaded and installed the update, I got a proliferation of bogus warning messages. I tried to shut the system down and had to delete each of these manually (about 25 jobs).At this point I uninstalled Counterspy and went back to the free Ad-aware program from Lavasoft (www.lavasoft.com), which I had never had any trouble with and is highly rated in the computer magazines. Ad-aware does not monitor spyware in the background, but updates are free (Counterspy charges after a year). It also seemed to be a bit faster than Counterspy and did not display confusing messages."
2,Don't buy - problems,"I bought this after reading the great reviews. It does seem to do the job of removing spyware, although not much better than some freeware. BIG problem is running a scan. If you tell it to run a full scan, it goes on forever and you can't stop it. All you get is a message that Counterspy is running and please wait. In my case, 4 hours later it finally stopped. According to Tech Support, you could cause problems if you try to stop it. Silly. When you schedule a scan and tell it to do a quick scan, it does a full scan - yup, 4 hours and 20 minutes!!! Tech Support says it should take only 30-40 minutes!Also, if you run Active Protection, Counterspy and its friends take up to 50 MB of memory.Subjectively, Counterspy seems to slow down the computer but that may be me.Bottom line - it MAY do the job but it is not worth it. Although I hate to say it, stick with Microsoft Defender - free and works. Counterspy is a waste of $19"
1,Read The Fine Print On This First !,"The product they are selling here is a 30 day trial of this software . The activation code in this box will not work . When you try and register this for one year and get new updates , you are told it will cost you another 19.99 . I thought maybe I had received a defective one , so I got a replacement, and the same deal . I have returned them both ,and I will look elsewhere for spyware software that has no hidden costs !"
3,AV sync only works with PCM output,I have this player and the picture quality is good over the HDMI cable. However my receiver does not have HDMI input so I use the digital coax connection from the dvd player to the receiver for the audio. Unfortunatley there is a terrible delay between the picture and sound so I thought I would try the AV SYNC feature I was told this player has. However it doesn't work at all for the digital dolby/DTS outputs but only works in PCM mode which is basically useless. They should make that fact more clear in their spec lists.
3,Nice player but short life span,"This was a nice DVD player, but it died after 2 1/2 years of use. I have another Sony DVD player that is at least 5 years old so I was disappointed when my newer one died."
3,Sony DVP-NS90V Multi-Function DVD Player,One of the best non-HD DVDs on the block. A shortage of SACD material has kept this unit from performing to full potential. A move to BluRay ended its short but mostly successful career prematurely. It now serves very well as a guest room source for my non-HD set.
5,A top notch mulit-format dvd player with excellent ease-of-use,"The title of this review says it all. If you are looking for a DVD up-converting player that supports a wide variety of formats and HDMI output... look no further.I owned a Toshiba with HDMI earlier, but it responded so terribly slowly to remote control and button clicks on the main unit. It also had problems with finger prints and even dust. I had to carefully clean disks and run a lens cleaner on the unit between every movie; sometimes even in the middle of a movie.The Sony starts up moderately quickly, responds very quickly to remote control commands and delivers an outstanding picture on our Samsung DLP 50"" TV.Get one for yourself and you will be please."
1,Stopped working. What's going on Sony?,"This is the second Sony DVD player in 2 different rooms that has crapped out on us in the past month. Both stopped reading discs, brand new discs even. No more Sony DVD players for us."
1,If you want to be depressed this is the book for you,"How could anyone write a book about respecting the soul and not have anything in related to spirituality or the Soul. Again Mr. Boykin Trashes his own community with his wealth of negativity. Keith go read some Emmett Fox, Iyllna Vanzant, Jonnie Coleman or something dealing with New Thought because you are not respecting anything or anyone with this book."
3,Would not recommend,Not very easy to work the rods to turn the men. We thought this was rather flimsy and would not recommend it.
4,rod hockey,the franklin sports rod hockey makes a great gift for kids. It was easy to order through amazon and we received it in a timely manner. It was a gift for my little boy and he enjoys it very much.
5,Quick Service,"Early Doug Sahm is aways welcome. I finally fiured out why he never became a bigger name, he was all over the place in his music selection, there are times you have to be in a niche. We miss you Doug"
5,takes me back,"Being a southern girl, this track takes me back to the college days with Jimmy Reed playing in the background of studying, partying, and lazing about. Even the more modern pieces just fit the fabulous movie--regardless of the reviews--it was great. On the way home from the movie I stopped and bought the soundtrack. Couldn't wait..."
4,Captures the movie,"If you enjoyed the movie, you're sure to like the CD. Although the songs do not quite represent the novel itself, they do succeed in capturing the spirit of the movie. I Want to Be Your Monther's Son-in-Law and Sitting in the Window of My Room are two of the best songs on the CD."
3,does anyone know what this song is,i was just wondering if anyone knew what song they were singing in the car when sandra bullock was a child. it goes something like...i love the moon and the moon loves me...is that a real song and does anyone know what the title of that song is??? let me know...thanx
2,Music of Divine Sisterhood,Needed songs for a friend. I did not care for full album just some of the songs.
4,pretty good book,i read this in one week.it is very good. has alot of action but you also get to know the storyline and charecters in the book. i liked that to.very well written. details were great.
5,The Best Charmed Book yet,This book i have just bought. When i started reading i couldn stop turning. It was such a great book and i loved it. my friend is reading it too and she loves it too. so go buy it and read it!
3,Not a Bad Watch,"The dial was smaller than I expected, but that was probably my fault. It's a good no-nonsense, dress/casual, lightweight watch. I like that it has the day as well as date display. It keeps time accurately."
5,What time is it?,Now I know with the fine watch from Amazon.com. The price was right and the delivery was quick. Using Amazon was great.
1,Weak and Lame,This cd is horrible.Too Rude is reggae at its weakest.Bass lines are weak and the lyrics are lame.This guy has no talent and cant make a good song.
2,dont buy this,"i have this cd, i listened to it several times through, and came to the conclution that it was a waste of money. It sounds to me that the singer is trying to be someone else. he talks about being arested, smoking weed and things of this fashion so much and so un poeticly that it just sounds like an image push. The music arangements are good, but leave you wanting to tell the band that their not the wailers, and the singer should stop trying to sound like bob marley. Bottom line, take it if someone wants to give it to you,but dont spend money on it. learn from my mistake"
5,Great voice = Great Music,If you like Sublime and Long Beach Shortbus then hit the button and get this cd. He has his own unique style that should not be missed. Check it out and buy this cd along with the new Long Beach Shortbus CD (great new music from Eric Wilson of Sublime).
5,Ragga-muffin stylee from so cal,"This is the Best Reggae album I have heard in a long time. With songs like New Sherrif, Connected, and If You Love It they have produced a vibe that can be fealt from coast to coast. You can find Too Rude's influence on a lot of the Kottonmouth King's albums and throughout the Sub-Noize tribe's family of artists.Peace,~prplkoosh"
5,Great cd,"Too Rude is a great cd. Too Rude is a long time friend of the Kottonmouth Kings and he apears on both of their cds. Too Rude (for my own good) is one of the best songs on here along with New Sheriff, Burn Kali, and Gun Shot. If you like a regea beat then you should like Too Rude."
5,A personal testimony of a woman's survival,"The House Of Many Faces is a personal testimony of a woman's survival and escape from sexism, materialism, and societal traps by seeking vision, empowerment, and personal validation within her own home. Room by room, metaphors offer guidance into the nature of the world itself, from inexorable advance of Daughter Truth and Father Time (who also represents death) to bare feet as a connection to the real world and not an illusory one. The text is presented in two columns per page, offering a distinctive reading experience as one follows the woman's journey from room to room, contemplating each item in the house. A poignant and profound masterpiece of literary allegory."
1,"Do not buy this album for ""Save Yourself""","I honestly tried to give this album a chance, but it is truly uninspired and dull. It is musically amateurish and lyrically awkward. C'mon, get with the program, guys. It's your 4th album already so go for something more grown up! Don't get me wrong, I really like ""Save Yourself"" and think it's a stroke of genius, but it's the only one on the album. Save yourself the trouble and get the Roswell Soundtrack instead. There are a lot of good songs on that album. If you're set on buying this album, I urge you to listen to it first from someone unfortunate enough to have bought it."
4,It's About Time,"Sometimes it takes awhile for bands to get there stuff out there; this is no exception for Sense Field. From there first ""major label"" release, Buildings, to there new full length Tonight and Forever, Sense Field has had there ups and downs. Fans around the world are glad they did not throw in the towel. If so, we would not have been able to collect another superiour album. Tonight and Forever is no different from any other Sense Field album. The same melodic guitar riffs that stick in your head for days, to the beautiful voice of singer John Bunch are all available. There are no lows in this album. In other words, they put in no fillers. Every song is a sucess, it just happens that ""Save Yourself"" is their first radio hit of this album. But do not be afraid, there will be more radio hits; you can count on it."
3,DUDE I'm a real Sense Field fan,"...and this cd is great; Especially the song ""Save Yourself"" it is beautiful and has lots of energy."
5,Found out about them from Christmas CD,"I hadn't heard of Sense Field until I bought a copy of the Christmas CD that they are on and was blown away by their take on ""Happy Christmas."" I went out and bought two of their cds the next week and have been listening to them habitually since."
4,"Yes, the JWs are under mind control.","In 1987, this was the first book that I ever read that was critical of Jehovah's Witnesses. It struck a nerve with me and when I tried to explain it to my JW wife, it didn't go so over so well. She turned me in to the elders at the Kingdom Hall and I suppose I could have lied and said I didn't believe JWs were wrong, but I couldn't. A year later my JW wife divorced me. She had a letter from the Watchtower headquarters telling her it was OK to break up our home in order to get rid of me and my negative Watchtower ideas. I think JWs would still divorce a spouse who openly left the Kingdom Hall and ""talked"" about what they had found out. That's the whole point, it's Orwellian mind control in operation and JWs actually seem to want their minds to be brainwashed."
2,Very basic,"Though the book does give information on CHL choosing, carrying, and very basic shooting technique, it is filled with stories of other peoples situations in which a CHL licenced gun was used. These were not really used as technique stories but as ""evidence"" that carrying a gun is useful. Though it is obviously a PRO gun use book, it also shows that if used, you will still incur lots of court cost, possible initial jail time, and personal/job losses.In short, not the defensive tactical book I was looking for."
2,Poor Quality Book,"The content is okay, but the quality of the book is terrible. The pages are falling out because the glue is not holding them. I take good care of my books, but this one is very poor quality."
4,A good guide for the newcomer in particular,"Found this to have more depth than most of the ""self-defense with handgun"" manuals, many of which are lacking in detail. Fine discussion of types of carry guns and holsters without particular biases. Beginning chapters with actual cases is instructive and interesting."
5,Outstanding Overview and Guide,This is an outstanding overview and guide to anyone who is thinking about or currently does own or carry handguns. It really makes you aware of the entire awsome responsibility and impact of making the decision to protect yourself. The focus is safety and responsibility. Lots of great links and references too for further research and training. I strongly would recommend that anyone with handguns or thinking about purchasing a handgun buy and read this book.
5,Before You Buy a Handgun...,"If you're considering buying a handgun, you should read this book first. You'll learn valuable self-defense techniques and how to avoid using your handgun at all costs."
4,Outstanding single source for self defense shooter,If you were to buy one book for a non-shooter friend who is interested in self-defense. The books only weakness is that it is only one book and you can only cover so much and stay readable. Great introduction to self-defense shooting.
5,Preschooler Issues,"""Pleasant characters and good story lines for all three stories."" ""The narrator's voice is soothing."" Running time of each is the right length for preschoolers. The stories are preschooler issues: nighttime fears, nobody's perfect, and staying up late. ""I like to sing along with boats and ocean creatures."" ""One boat was grumpy, but said she was sorry."" ""A favorite was when the boats turned off their lights and told Hank about the Big Dipper."" ""I want to know how they found things on the ocean floor."" Best for ages 2 to 5."
3,Meh...,"Not as good as I thought it'd be. Listenable, but unless you are an Egypt fan, pass on it. Not that heavy, not that deep."
1,A Waste if you don't have a DTS Decoder,"As the title says, unless you have a dts decoder, you won't be able to play this CD. It might be great that it's digital surround, but there's not point in buying a CD that can only be played using a specific machine.Be sure to purchase something else, and be on the look out for the ""dts Digital Surround"" label at the top. Very misleading, especially when the image isn't large enough to view the fine print."
2,Cassette without text book,I received this Cassette set without any paper. How I can practice to the IELTS examination without answer sheet any text? <There should be a warning> that these cassettes do not have text book and we have to purchase it separately. I think this is too costly only for cassette.
4,very helpful for your ielts preparation,"these cassettes are very helpful for your ielts preparation.the speed and the pronunciation are the same as the actual ielts. the cassettes themselves deserve 5 stars, but the reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that Amazon didn't put the corresponding book together. Amazon sells them seperately.So you should buy both the book and cassettes in order to get the perfect practice."
2,An incomplete study guide,"It gives the Listening Section exactly as it appears in the exam. But there is no way one can Practice for the exam using these CD's as no booklet is provided with it containing the Q & A's. So I think I sort of, wasted the fifty bucks I spent buying it with expedited shipping."
5,I believe you will find it useful in test-preparation,Recording is clear. Speed is just like one in the real exam.
5,Charlie and Choc Factory Great Book!,"This is a timeless book for all ages. I purchased the book used. The retailer said it was in good condition and only had the owners name written inside the binding. This was a perfect and exact description. Further, the book came on time as promised in 7 days. I purchased this book for my son to replace one I had for over 35 years and it is a wonderful story, great black and white drawings (which are not faded), and none of the pages are ripped, marked, or worn as any book would have with time. Great retailer and I would purchase other books from them in the future."
4,Advanced Students,This book is for the advanced Judo/JiuJitsu student written by an advanced player/instructor. Well worth the effort and price of purchase.
5,Foundation of everything,"Sometimes the most obvious truths are the ones we ignore: every grappling-based martial art begins on the feet, and it is impossible to bring your opponent to the mat without grabbing him. Adams provides an excellent overview of grip fighting in judo-- how to use different grips to throw your opponent, how to use grips to thwart a throw, how to break grips, and how to establish a dominant grip. What isn't covered (primarily because judo is thought of as a standing sport) is how to use grips on the mat. Old school practitioners of judo, and those who practice bjj should be able to use Adams' discussion of grips while standing and apply them to mat work. Want to pass someone's guard? You need a grip. Want to keep someone in your guard? Get a good grip. This book has changed the way I think about grappling, and I highly recommend it to anyone who practices a grappling-based martial art."
1,Useless,"Roxio pretends that the created ringtones can be used with an LG VX8100, but Verizon offers no way to use sounds as ringtones, and Roxio's directions to the phone don't correspond to the software options on the phone. After wasting a couple of hours in futility with this software (which often crashes on a Mac), I found myself mumbling ""iPhone... iPhone... iPhone""."
1,does not work as advertised,Xingtone 5 is advertised as being compatible with a Nokia 6030 phone. After buying the product I discovered it is not compatible with the phone. Roxio admits there is a problem but continues to advertise it as compatible. Don't assume that your phone will work with the software even if it is listed on the Xingtone website.Not good
1,Find free software on the Internet,"A complete waist of American dollars. Sooo not worth the money. I've gotten better quality with ""free"" software from the Internet. If I were the merchant selling this junk, I'd be ashamed to take anyones money. And if I were the creator, I'd hide my face in shame.The, ""Tech Nut""."
2,Not as described,"Product description isn't accurate. These boxes aren't metal reinforced. They are rather cheapo, build-yourself boxes. Not as sturdy as expected."
1,Faulty product,Clock survived less than 1 week before it died...had to send it back to the manufacturer.
5,Very fashionable Scarf,I received my scarf today and love it! Material feels good and the style and colors are amazing. Great deal.
3,exactly,This product was exactly what it was suppposed to be. It showed up on time and it seems to be as good as any other.
3,It's Okay,This product can be purchased on the recommendation of a friend. I had no problem with the timely delivery of the product. I'll try to see how it goes
5,In the North of England,"I have owned this book for years. It is a lovely book, with well-written text and beautiful illustrations. I sometimes ""read"" only the illustrations, to bring back to mind sights I enjoyed."
2,Dont buy!,I bought this item and found that the black shaded suede strip was loosing its color. This is just another low qualty item manufactured in China. The company also have a 14 days return policy without any refund for shipping cost (to and from). Basically it cost me almost $ 30.00 to open/check and return the item. Stay away from this!
3,Service Ok,"The product was delivered as stated, but I could not believe how long it took considering that this was a small booklet that could have easily fit in an envelope and mailed first class. It would have taken much less time to receive it."
5,An ECE thumbs up!,"I have had the pleasure and opportunity to have had Ms. Wurm work as my program's consultant this year. Reading ""Working in the Reggio Way A Beginners Guide for Teachers"" really brings all of the theory and practice that Julie Lives, Walks and Breathes! I found this book to be ""People Friendly"" and a hard one to put down! This book really empowers ECE teachers in creating our own ""Reggio Way"" here in the states. It's also a book which reminds us to place children first."
4,Excellent teacher resource - can be applied in almost any classroom environment.,"Reggio, in the broadest sence, can be used in any classroom, simply by allowing children (or adults) to learn by discovery."
3,A Slow Moving & Very Detailed Read!,"I felt this book moves very slow and it makes the St Augustine Florida Police look as stupid as they are chasing a serial killer all around our coastline starting from the early 1980's,until they finally catch him after all the killing he did beforehand!Its filled with way to many details on useless stuff about the state of Florida and the coastline starting with the Indians and how St Augustine started as a ""HISTORIC TOWN""SOME TOWN I tell ya! its so full of crime that you dont dare go there even in a so called decent area.book did not hold my interest at all,(AND I LIVE HERE FOLKS) man is sex killer and killed 4 women.JUST FILLED WITH TO MUCH USELESS INFO FOR MY TASTE .."
5,"Very well written thriller, very good pictures","True story of a serial killer on the loose. He (William Lindsey) admitted to seven killings, but possibly caused many more accross the United States. Very good summer reading."
5,True Crime book that I could not put down,This book is a page turner! Living in Florida and having visited St. Augustine many times makes these crimes shocking and unforgivable. St. Augustine is world renown as the historic vacation destination. I had no clue about West Augustine and the underground seediness of crime it contains.This book is fascinating and I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of true crime!!
1,Can't Review Wrong Product,I thought I was getting replacement heads for my Crest Spinbrush Pro. I'm sure it was my fault for selecting the wrong item but now I've got replacements heads for a brush I don't even have.
4,Profitable Patterns for Stock Trading by Larry Pessavento,"Larry has a good grasp of an excellent concept in patterns that go beyond the old standard wedges, triangles, head and shoulders type formations. The book would be better if the math he used were correct. Many of the examples have math or geometry errors, confusing the reader. Once you are past that and ""do your own homework"" as he challenges the reader to do, you will see stocks in a whole different light. Some of the patterns he refers to have a mirror image which can appear as well, even though he does not allude to it. The book is a tad pricey, too."
2,reminds me of a children's book,"Huge pages, skinny book with lots and lots of pictures (charts). Basically the book identifies Gartley and Butterfly patterns with a touch of basic fibonacci rules. Over 2/3 of the book consists of full page charts of examples. My advice if you're unfamiliar with these patterns is to go to longorshort. c o m and read about it for free. Larry has some examples on his own page. There are numerous typos that will make you scratch your head about the editors. That said, these patterns can be quite reliable if you open your eyes to them and that information alone is worth learning about ..."
1,Like the patterns Larry has illustrated,The pattern recognition methodology illustrated in the text will be of interest to anyone that has ever traded using technical charts. I can say with confidence that there are very few who have researched patterns to the extent Larry has.
5,Blade 400 Servo Upgrade,I installed these servos as a replacement to the Eflite stock servos in my Blade 400 helicopter. They are much better than the stock servos. Controll has improved and they are much stronger.
1,Don't buy Hitec junk,"I bought this for my RC18 and you CANNOT find a horn screw long enough. Even if you buy the Hitec spare screw kit, they give you three 2.2mm screws (the short ones) and three 2.6mm long screws that do not fit! What's the point of giving you 2 different diameter of screws but no assortment of lengths. Hitec is annoying."
3,Best to go for a cheaper hits collection...,"This disc was most likely issued to cash in on her appearance from Hit Me Baby One More Time, the British version. As much as I love this band, we don't need another collection. These great songs can be found cheaper on ""Greatest Hits"" or ""Heart and Soul: Greatest Hits"" ect. Since only 3 albums are on this label the selection on the many compilations in print don't vary much."
2,a big disappointment,"I bought this book based on reviews on this site and others. The descriptions are better than average, but the maps are of poor quality. Sorry, but good maps are ESSENTIAL for hiking in unfamiliar places! I've seen better maps of neighborhood walks in Frommer's and other general-use guides, and the maps of the trails in the SF part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (specifically the Coastal Trail), which were what I bought the book for, were inadequate. From experience, it is not good when you are reduced to hiking with a book in one hand for the description of the trail, because if that's all you have, you'll get turned around at some point. I'm still looking for a better guidebook."
4,Cockatiels(Complete Pet Owner's Manuals),"I'm a new cockatiel owner my husband got it for me for a birthday present actually early birthday present. I have read and re read the book over and over again. I still enjoy it.Also I look for information on cockatiels on the internet so I feel pretty well set on information I need.I got the bird on August 13,2001 from a breeder in town.He's a emerald cockatiel which is a recessive gene mutation. His name is Tristan Jade and I call him ""Jade"" for short.I have really enjoyed him tremendously :)Cockatiels are amazing birds!This book has all the things I needed to know.If you miss something then you can look it up in the index at the back of the book or read the pages over.You will see something you missed."
3,Good basic information,"Though I have owned three Budgies before, I had never previously owned a Cockatiel,(I recently bought two) so I bought this book to learn a little more about them. It was a good, basic book, but I would not recommend this book to a seasoned owner, as they would almost most certainley not learn anything new. I would, however, recommend this book to a first time bird owner, as they would learn a great deal."
5,A very informative reference book,"I've had a pair of cockatiels for the past two years. They are very easy to look after, and like all pets, they crave attention. I bought this book - and others - because I came home one evening to a pair of eggs at the bottom of the cage!!!! I was totally unprepared, and needed some guidance. This book didn't disappoint.The author is matter-of-fact and to the point, and the advice is easy to follow, even for a novice like me. Thanks to this book, I realise that I am on the right track. Now all I need to do is add more veggies to my angel's diet and they'll continue to be their best at all times"
3,"Tough lady, a fighter!","Benazir Bhutto, is not only the first woman to have led a post-colonial Muslim state, she has also achieved that status of ""political royalty"" something like that of the Kennedy family in the US or the Gandhi family of India. Hers is a life that has been full of theatrics... the hanging of her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, education at Harvard and Oxford, becoming Prime Minister, her life in self-imposed exile, her ""deal"" with President Musharraf as well as the recent attempts on her life. This particular autobiography is ""dated"" and needs substantial material to make it relevant to the present day context of Pakistan but is an interesting read nonetheless. Benazir's book shows that she's a tough lady and a fighter!"
1,robot,this book is exemplary of an aristocratic book that has no tangible value for anyone who reads it. As a Financial Analyst I found some of the reading very dull and and unrelated to the topic of financial analysis.
2,Let's be real ...,"The look of these rings are not for everyone. I had never had a titanium ring before, and was surprised by it's light wieght - so much so that I couldn't help shake the feeling it was a plastic ring my kids would wear.An 8mm wide ring is also very big ... take a real close look at this ring before buying. I'm looking for a different one now ...I tried to increase the rating of my review (from 2 stars to 4) but apparently this is not possible.The reason for this is simply because of the great return policy Silver Insanity has - would recommend them for a ring purchase. No hassles ..."
2,Nice ring,"The ring came in a timely manner wrapped in a nice velvet pouch. However, it is a bit rough around the edges and it did not stay the silver color as the picture shows, it is more of a brushed gold color."
3,Beware of Expensive Shipping Rates from this Seller,"The product is great- but the shipping was outrageous... The company changed the amount charged for shipping and when I called to ask why it was an additional $3.00, they stated that the $5.95 was their base price and then they charged per ounce of product -- 18 ounces of lotion cost an additional $3.00; $8.95 for shipping, $9.95 for the lotion- would have been cheaper to purchase at a local store. They didn't seem to really know what was going on and the product came wrapped in old newspapers.. Not very professional. I wouldn't purchase from this seller again, but I would buy the product, Hempz Lotion, from a different seller."
5,you may want to splurge for this one!,"I felt almost sick after spending $15 on LOTION, however, upon receiving the product I was not let down.It feels great on my skin (no greasy feel), it smells awesome, and moisturizes for hours after use. I had first sampled the product a few weeks ago and was in desperate search of lotion that actually does all that it claims. I have really dry skin and this lotion exceeds my expectations. I highly recommend spending more for something that works!"
5,Interesting book of lists which include anything worldwide!,We have all enjoyed reading segments of this book. The lists are surprising and very enlightening. Many vast areas of knowledge compiled in this terrific book. A great gift!
4,Just about everything here,Very entertaining and covered about every subject matter under the sun. This book was well researched and presented in an easy to read manner.
3,Ain't A D**n Thing Changed!!!,"Tight, tight, tight....Lyrically WC must have been very motivated because you can hear it in his lyrics and flow. The production is tight, honestly the beats sound like some Dr Dre throw away tracks. And we all know even Dre's throw away trks are bangin'.If you are looking for some of that ole school west coast str8 g-s**t, then this is the album for you. Cube helped with the album and u can see his influence. But this is still WC's album because he keeps the guest appearance to the low. Glad I bought this album, money well spent. Hotep!!"
4,GANGSTA RAP AT ITS BEST,"BEST ALBUM OF 2007! IF YOU ARE A FAN OF WESTCOAST RAP THEN YOU WOULD LOVE THIS CD. ITS DOESNT HAVE THAT CLUB OR RADIO SOUND THAT HIP HOP DEMANDS FROM YOU NOW, BUT ITS FULL OF GANGSTA SHHH, AND LA CULTURE, THAT STRAIGHT GANGSTA CRIP WALK SPECIAL THAT ONLY DUB C, AND BRING. SO IF YOU LOVE DUB C, CUBE, WESTSIDE CONNECTION, OR WESTCOAST GANGSTA RAP, THIS IS A MUST GET FOR YOU. WEST OR NOTHING"
5,Jump rope,"I bought it for my husband and he uses it a lot!! It has really helped him to get back into shape, thank you!! The item arrived on time without any problems!!"
4,Inclusion is More Than Nondiscrimination,"This is a great text for those interested in the cause of children with disabilities. ""Making a Place"" is easy to read, with detailed descriptions of real children and their families. Throughout its pages, the author challenges us to look again at how to make our communities more accessible.Of particular interest to me was the discussion of ""inclusion as nondiscrimination"" (pp.178-179). Treating children ""the same"" is not the core commitment of inclusion. Rather, it is providing each child with the opportunity to access and participate in the activities of his or her age group. Dale Fink's book provides practical ideas for moving forward in achieving this goal."
1,worst delerium's stuff,"I fell in love with Delerium's special atmosphere. I loved voices and sensations of Karma, Poem and Chimaera. As with Archives vol.1 I tried but I hardly reach the end of this cd without falling asleep. it's not Delerium's music, it's just a collections of ideas of sounds used to perform and create all the rest. Maybe I wasn't able to understand it, but I didn't like it. (also though it was something made just to sell to people that -as me- has bought every Delerium's creation"
5,STRAINER!,"Great strainer, and heavier than it looks on the screen. This could potentially be used as a paper weight its so heavy."
5,Best starter book for those wanting to learn SQL,"If you want to learn more about SQL, this book is the way to go. I used it to pass the first SQL & PL/SQL exam for OCP certification. It is clearly written, with lots of exercises. The exercises relate to real-life situations, so it is easy to transfer the techniques they demonstrate over to your own work.An excellent book!"
5,Excellent investement if you are new to SQL,This is an excellent investment if you do not know SQL and want to learn PL/SQL. I actually took an instructor led course on this to get me ready for the first Oracle test and found this book to be much better at explaining the concepts then my instructor. Blasted! =-> Highly recommend this book.
2,Title Misleading - Very little PL/SQL,"I bought this book to learn more PL/SQL, but 95% of it is about SQL. The title suggests PL/SQL. If you want to know more about PL/SQL, this is not the book to buy."
5,A perfect book for a newcomer to PL/SQL,"I enjoyed reading the PL/SQL 101 thoroughly, I have finished one complete reading of the book and now I am going through it the second time. I decided to buy this book after getting totally frustrated of asking others to help me with Oracle. I asked our dedicated Oracle DBA to show me how to create a simple table, it took me more than three months to chase her and could not get any result and one day I found out she was gone, then I bought the PL/SQL 101 and in chapter one the author explains the most basic way to get going.Remember this is a 101 book, if you already know quite a bit of SQL, then this book might bore you. The title is perfect, and its readers should of that level.I would like to thank the author for getting me hooked to Oracle and PL/SQL the easy way (Ofcourse there is no easy way, you still have to read and reread the book several times, and practice and practice)."
4,Where's the Beef?,"I am an OCP and wanted this book to improve upon my PL/SQL skills. I'd say 2/3 of this book is basic SQL for beginners. I already know most of that part so I was kind of disappointed. I guess when I saw the title of the book ""Oracle PL/SQL 101"" I thought it was for people who wanted to learn the basics of procedures and packages. The last third of the book is devoted to PL/SQL and is a good overview and a good first step, but it is too condensed and only touches on the basics. If you are a beginner studying for your PL/SQL OCP test (which didn't include a lot of PL/SQL at least when I took it) this book may be worth a read. If you are looking to actually do something useful with PL/SQL another book may be for you."
1,"If looking for PL/SQL do not buy, if looking for SQL maybe.",This book is incorrectly titled. It should read Oracle 101 SQL not PL/SQL. Simply put there are only 2 skimpy chapters on PL/SQL. If looking for PL/SQL purchase a different text and save yourself the aggravation and lost cost issues.
5,Easy to read and understand,Great book for reference or for a newbie programmer! This is a great read and it's easy to understand! I recommend it!
5,Great introduction to SQL and PL/SQL,"Wow, this book is so easy. I didn't know I could learn SQL and PL/SQL so fast.If you are already an experienced developer in PL/SQL, get another book - this says ""101"" right in the title! It's for people just learning SQL and PL/SQL! And it's a perfect choice for doing that.A great purchase and a bargain too."
5,It is a great book for beginners,I am learning Oracle now in the biggest computer school in Beijing. All of our classmates think this book is the best one we have read for beginners.
3,GOOD BOOK FOR BEGINNERS!!!,"This book is good for beginneers. Even though it covers sql with very good examples, it doesnt do justice to Pl.Pl is covered only in last two chaptars. i dont think this book is worth for 35.99$.moreover this book doesnt contain any practice excersies or exams!!"
2,Title is misleading - It's an introduction to SQL and .....,"PL/SQL. If you're beginner, you may learn something out of this book, but you should consider other options (there is no practice excersies). If you're experienced SQL programmer you should not even waste time and money in this book.PL/SQL is covered only in the last two chapters and just scratches the surface of PL/SQL. It should've been called introduction to SQL 101."
3,Just for Beginners,"This book is just for beginners and never takes you above that level such that you are doing any programming. You will learn SQL. You will learn a little about how Oracle works. I am sure there are books that cover this material just as well in a few chapters instead of 9 as this book does, plus gets you started using Oracle and programming in Oracle PL/SQL. I don't recommend this book to be used as a text book. The material can easily be covered in 4 weeks. It can't be stretched to a 16 week semester course."
3,Great SQL Book...But IMHO : Wrong Title,"I would aggree with all the positive reviews for this book on most aspects. With re to just ordinary, intro SQL..this book is great ! My feeling is that even the most technically-challenged people will feel comfortable going thru this book and become productive. But IMHO, SQL is definitely NOT PL/SQL. I can't help but think that the title is not right. I mean there are only 2 chapters pertaining to PL/SQL out of 9. So if you want to learn SQL in 7 days: Get and keep this book !(You may need to re-read it) But if you're looking to get to the the next level, this book may not be what you really NEED. It'll definitely whet your ""appetite"" though. To be honest, i found it hard to plunk $40 for 2 chapters worth of material that i'm interested in. So i read them in the bookstore. But i'll definitely save my lunch money for the next real PL/SQL book by Mr Allen !"
3,"OK, overall, But Very Incomplete Index","I was looking for more PL/SQL than this book offers (misleading title, I feel), but it contains good material. My biggest frustration, though (and unfortunately, this is shared by many technical books) is that the index is very incomplete. I would say that 80% of what I want to find in the book turns up empty when I use the index. Eventually I can find it by turning many pages, but I'd prefer not to waste so much time."
1,No answers + no tapes or CDs = Useless,"I ordered this book after reading the 5 star review, and upon receiving it realized that it is a STUDENT edition, with NO ANSWERS and NO tapes or CDs (or even a written script) for the listening sections! Without answers and tapes, it is useless as an AP study guide! The Amazon description of the book should state this, so other people don't waste their time ordering it. I couldn't find the missing items on Amazon, so I searched the web until I found the teacher guide ($16.97) and tapes ($49.97) on the Prentice Hall webpage."
5,Perfect for Shakespeare class!,My daughter was taking a Shakespeare class and found this box was a perfect addition to enhance the class!! !
5,Darling gift for a wonderful Grandparent,"This is a great gift book to give, and even better if you give it with the companion book The Gift of Being Grand. My sister bought this for my mom. I was drawn to it immediately because of the beautiful illustrations, then as you read the words inside The Gift of Being Grand you are touched by it's sweetness. I ordered both books as a gift for my mother-in-law. I now realize that I want to order another set for a mentor/friend who is also a special Grandma. The Grand-o-Grams make it easy for a busy, but loving/caring Grandparent to drop a quick note to their special someone. My kids love to get mail and I know that they will treasure these notes coming from their Grammie and Gramma. Thank you to the author for a delightful combination of sweet art, thoughtfulness and gift that keeps on giving."
