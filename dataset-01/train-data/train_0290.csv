3,decent album,"I was a little disappionted with this album. After hearing Nailbomb and late Sepultura, I thought this would be even better. Its not though. Do yourself a favor and buy an album like Roots or Point Blank. This is a very medicore effort by Calevera."
2,"This has been done once before, on Roots.","Quite honestly, this album has a decent sound to it. The heaviness, the musicianship, the vocals, the parts all come together nicely most of the time. The problem is that this album is a total 'Roots' rip-off. There's no new material on this album. In addition, the sound gets eminently repetitive over time, as did 'Roots' at times... I recommended it to those who absolutely worship Max Cavalera. Otherwise, the album is completely unoriginal, uncreative, and done much better with Sepultura."
2,"2,5 stars",This album is not Sepultura album. if you are waiting for another Chaos ad or Arise or any other good album Sepultura had with Max then forget it. This is a bad album. All the songs are the same. There is no good rhythm and the music sounds monotonic and without inspiration. Only to very huge fans of Sepultura
5,Pure Brazillian Energy,"I was saddened when I heard Max left Sepultura, such a brutal, unforgivining voice was gone from the world of music and a great band lost its edge. Then out of the ashes Soulfly rises and never lets you away from its grip. Along with some great guest apperances from Chino Moreno, Fred Durst (I don't see why he should have been on this masterpiece though), and DJ Lethal. From the beggining chords of Eye for an Eye, Soulfly never lets go an forces you to listen. Every song is good ranging from the brutal Eye for an Eye to the slow Soulfly."
2,No Sepultura,"Soulfly aren't that good, the lyrics are bad, the singing isnt very good and the instrument playing is pathetic. Lets get back to the good ol days of sepultura"
5,one of my favorite Heavy Metal bands,"If you've heard Sepultura and liked it, in case you don't know, this is Max Cavalera's new band, and might I add, is ALOT better than Sepultura! I love the way they added those tribal beats and the Brazilian music style in the middle of one of the best sounding heavy metal music cds I've heard. I'm Brazilian myself and even out of all the other Brazilian heavy metal bands I hear when I'm there (although there aren't that many, but there's also this band called Raimundos which is all sung in portuguese but its still wicked for those who don't understand the language) Soulfly is still the best! Max Cavalera's vocals are insane! Check it out! (if you have enough money or are up to getting the import with extra tracks, get it! the extra songs are wicked! Cangaceiro is the best song! )"
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","How could Max go from ""Beneath the Remains,"" one of the greatest metal records of all time, to this load of garbage? I understand that he wanted to move on from Sepultura, but why this?? The lyrics are uninspired, and he's lacking the spark of co-writing with former bandmate, Andreas Kisser. His vocal style has been going downhill since Chaos AD, but this is the epitome of how low Max can go. His backup musicians [are not very good] too...Don't buy this. Buy ""Beneath The Remains."""
1,More like Sh**fly,"This cd sucks,in my opinion. I mean,i'm sorry but this isn't metal (KoRn,Limp Bizkit,Metallica, Sevendust,Staind,etc.)This is more like stainless steel. The lyrics just plain suck,and no,I dont mind swearing,its just the LYRICS SUCK. I'm not writing this to make any enemies or to lash out,I'm just saying that personally I like the above bands much better and maybe you will too. Thanks."
5,Read this,"This album is sweet. Soulfly has all the elements of an intense band. The harsh vocals, loud guitars and literally thunderous drumming. Sometimes the vocals are in Portugese but they sound cool - not light like Puya, and (not to be taken the wrong way) Ill Nino. ""I Am Loco"" = Nino's best. The only thing I don't really dig would be the instrumental(s), they might be cool on a tripp!"
5,ALL HAIL SOULFLY,"I bought the domestic version of soulfly the second it came out only to find that this box set came out later and let me tell you that the second cd with the live tracks was worth purchasing the album all over again, I heard some of Soulfy's new stuff at OZZFEST 2000 and it sounded awesome....BRING ON THE SECOND COMING OF SOULFLY....QUILOMBO !!!!!!!!!"
4,A worthy opponent.....,"Soulfly really got off on the right foot, and so did Max at that.I am in agreement with zach on the last rating, the so-called ""new and improved"" Sepultura really does lack the edge that Max gave the band. But I still think that old Sepultura (Roots, most preferably) still would surpass this album in most ways.But if you are reading this, you are considering purchasing this album only. I strongly suggest you click the BUY button. because along with countless other metal fans, trust me, Max and his new Soulfly tribe dont dissappoint.Sorry for not writing indecisive comments about Soulfly ppl. I just did it for Sepultura ""Roots"". go look if you want...."
2,Reader From England,"I recently purchased this book for my Meng Project, involvingcontrolling a vision head focus,zoom through a pic serial port connected to a pc with vision modelling.I am surprised, that the code is written in a fashion which istotally unbearable, hard to understand and just reflects the authors perception and imagination rather than discussing theimportant communication building blocks and instructions.Its totally ambigious to distinguish the original c++ routines and the invented commands written in form of classes.I think if i read through all that material in header files i will lag so behind completing my original project.....The paper quality is poor and not very pleasant to read."
1,Racist book,"I hate this book. it is racist. the snooty rich white Texans think their so fricking cool and big that they can boss around all the Mexicans. the book portrais Leslie as the hero, BUT, she is just as racist as any of them. White people just like to think that they are bigger than any other race. History shows that whites have been mean to every other race on EARTh. Im out."
3,Mediocre,"Unlike many adaptations, the movie Giant is far better than the book. I found nothing but flat characters and gross oversimplification of Texas history and culture. It was a quick read, but it certainly wasn't worth the time. I suspect that Ms. Ferber has written some excellent novels, but Giant is not one of them."
1,"VERY DISAPPOINTED, Bill's first album was GREAT","This album is GARBAGE. If you loved Bill Gable's first album, you'd be very disappointed if you bought this one. I suppose this is what happens when an artist takes to long of break between albums.Bill is talented, but this album sounds like he and his freinds got together after a night of drinking, and just started playing instruments and free-styling. Absolutely no direction."
4,Favre's a favorite,"I bought two copies of this book for my sons, who both like to cook. They have both enthusiatically endorsed the recipes and like the heartiness of them. The foods are simple, yet have a real southern taste and don't call for exotic ingredients that are impossible to get."
4,Son of Tarzan,"I thought it was good.It held my interest from page 1 all the way through.If you have read any of the other Tarzan books,then this is a must read.It tells the story of Tarzan's son and his tribulations of how,why and when and what happens on the way to Africa,what happens after he gets there and what happens when he meets up Big Bwana.Marty"
4,Pretty good,"This one has an interestingly diverse plot that introduces to the public the character of Korak the Killer, son of Tarzan. Gotta read it!"
3,Very nice frame,"This is a high quality solid wood frame that has a very formal, expensive appearance. It is all real wood, which is rare to find at this price. The overall attention to detail was not A+ ; my frame had areas where the paint was pooled, and it had one noticeable chip at a corner joint. The gold overlay was very nice and complimented the background color well. It was packaged nicely to prevent damage, so I suspect the chip appeared prior to or during the packing process. Not a bad frame by any means for this reaasonable price if it were not for the minor cosmetic flaws."
1,Never Worked - Had to Return,"This item never worked for me. Hooked it up according to the directions, and spent many hours trying to figure out why it was not sending a bluetooth signal. Returned to Amazon for a speedy refund. Thanks Amazon.com for a respectable return policy."
1,Careful! Bad design.,"The components of this microscope that generate the light from batteries started melting in its first application. The batteries got very hot. Upon inspection, the design is flawed. If used around children, be VERY CAREFUL. Meade is generally a very good company, but this item, manufactured in China, is flawed."
3,Good Microscope,We were just looking for a beginner scope but this looked like so much more for the price. The lighting really works well to view deatils. We have had fun as a family trying some of the slides suggested in the instructions.
1,Terrible Quality,"I ordered two sets of these from Amazon for use leveling a tiny house on a trailer that I am building. At the time I purchased them, the total weight of the trailer was just 3000 lbs. The jacks started breaking at the very first use. The hardware that holds the hex head onto the handle sheared off. This happened eventually on all four handles. The jacks were also extremely difficult to turn. Needless to say, these were returned to Amazon immediately. Do yourself a favor, and buy something that's more expensive and better quality."
3,Trailer Scissor Jack,"Hoping to find an easy way to level the trailer, we installed these scissor jacks and were pleased with their operation while the trailer was parked on cement. Easily lifts and levels. However, when setting the trailer on uneven ground while camping, the jacks didn't operate as easily."
5,Quality Product,"Bought 4 of these to replace an old rusty set that was on my older camper. I like the lug nuts on the end much better than the old style. I was able to swap mine out by just removing the bolts and the old jacks and bolting this in the exact same place, no drilling was needed as the holes lined up perfectly for me."
1,never arrived!,"ironically i had a subsciption when i was a little kid of about 10.it also never came! surprise.back story. my father bought me a subscription when i was very young . i remember 2 things. 1st: it came like once every 2 months and took about 4-5 months for the 1st issue to arrive. 2nd: my grandparents quickly threw away those that i did recieveso, ... forward 23 years. a new subscription. 2 months later, no arrival.but in this day of technology i send them several emails. NOT ONE RESPONSE.so same story. no magazine in hand (to dork out too.)and i dont even care if i do get the magazine at this point . ill just get my money back and buy Rue Morgue instead!hope you have better lick than myself.maybe now they'll respond."
5,an excellent source for contemporary horror info,"there are two outstanding magazines that are easy to aquire pertaining to modern horror . the other you know is RUE MORGUE . when you want to read about horror , you don't turn to such otherwise excellent sources as LEONARD MALTIN'S MOVIE CRAZY or MICHAEL MEDVED'S movie minute or even ROTTENTOMATOES . you come to these folks because they know their own . my only qualm with the mag is that it's covers make it quite embarrassing to get in the mail or purchase at a bookstore . i wish they'd ship in a envelope of some sort . the text is great . the behind the scenes features are very interesting . the interviews lots of fun . i'd like more reviews (buts what's here is most often spot on) . no one is more critical of their own genre than these passionate folks . if you like modern horror and you look to folks other than FANGORIA , it's at your own peril ."
3,Decent Horror Magazine,This isn't the best horror magazine especially in terms of interesting quality reading (Rue Morgue is) but it usually has decent features on new horror movies. Again the pictures could be better quality but they aren't horrible. I buy this magazine every now and then when it features a movie I'm into.
3,"Well Organized, poor cams","The Armoire is great as far as how it is layed out. Able to get all the computer stuff, plus gaming system etc in very nice looking, closeable cabinet. Plus takes up very little floor space.Some assembly required. Plan on spending an hour or more putting it together.Only complaint is that the aluminum cams are too soft, so not able to really tighten up the connections. Either the cams broke or stripped out."
3,Beth Hartly's second venture into sleuthing,"Beth is very busy in her legal research business. Her neighbor Phillip Barry is murdered in his office. His son, Peter, who shovels snow for Beth in the winter, asks Beth to help solve the crime. Of course, Beth can't say no.This is an entertaining mystery. There is nothing special about it, but the characters and the mystery were interesting and it was a quick read."
2,amateurish,About halfway through this book I just skipped to the last couple of pages. I couldn't keep any of the characters straight and didn't really care about any of them. There were needlessly detailed descriptions of things that had nothing at all to do with the plot. I will pass on this author in the future.
1,Disappointing Tedium,"This was a hard book to stay with. The author bogs the slender story down with detailed descriptions of who wore what and who ate what along with her tea. There's a potentially interesting plot hidden there somewhere, but it's so overladen with unessential verbiage that some may give up before finding it. I'll probably pass on searching for others by this author."
5,LOTS OF FUN AND BEAUTIFULLY SUNG,The sublime Anna Moffo in radiant voice at her peak surrounded by a first rate cast in an excellent translation -only wish it was complete instead of just excerpts!
4,Great CD for little ones,My 4 year old son loves this CD and the PBS series. We listen to the CD almost every day and he has learned many of the songs and sings along. The songs are very sweet and teach good lessons. I even find myself singing along to many of them. Recommended if your child loves the Jay Jay series!
2,Misleading,"I looked at name of the group, the cover with the lion standing atop a broken stone tablet, and the song title ""The Return of Aslan"" and assumed that this had something to do with CS Lewis's fantasy chronicles of Narnia. WRONG WRONG WRONG!If you are a fan of CS Lewis, then by all means do NOT get this album. If you are a fan of Christian metal then you may want to check out this album.The music is actually pretty good, but after being tricked into buying this album, i find it hard to sit through the album without feeling ""had"". They were right about one thing - it *was* an ""Awakening"" for me...!"
2,"Great music, horrible lyrics","The music is vintage Yngwie Malmsteen. If you like Yngwie, you will love these guys' music. However, the lyrics are Christian propaganda of the worst kind, i.e. there is no subtlety, they will bash you over the head with a Bible. If you can tolerate these kind of lyrics (or if your stereo has a ""karaoke"" button), this CD is excellent. Otherwise, you may consider it unlistenable (I fall in the latter category)."
2,not so good.....,"first off this is a single with remixes not an album, dont be fooled like i was.....its ok but not worth the price, get full tension beaters instead, its a whole lot better! this one is pretty much glorified dance music...."
5,"FABULOUS PERFORMANCES, FANTASTIC BARGAIN","These symphonies were originally released by Nimbus and in their present incarnation are an absolute steal at the price that Brilliant is charging.For the most part I prefer many of the interpretations of Adam Fischer over those of Antal Dorati. It is not just the modernity of the recordings but I feel that this conductor has gotten the spirit of Haydn into his blood - and that of his most excellent orchestra - better than Dorati and many, many others.Run, don't walk, to purchase this bargain set of some 30 odd discs and you will not be disappointed.Very, very highly recommended to all aficianados of Haydn symphonies - the ingenuity and constant creatity of tunes of Papa Haydn simply astound!Timothy Wingate OTTAWA CANADA"
4,Wowed me!,"I came across tracks to this CD and I enjoyed it so much that I placed my order the next day. This CD rocks. Its got a smooth flow that I could listento forever. My favorite trank has to be ""i kiss your eyes."" If you like Anabolic Frolic, you'll enjoy this!"
3,Not a first class fight film,Big Ving Rhames fan always thought that Stacy Dash was a super fox appreciate Robert Townsend attempting to tell the story of such a fame and troubled sports figure. But the story moved slow didn't like how he filmed his fight scenes could have been more detailed overall a 3 star for not bad but good content.
2,No variety at All!,"I finally had to force myself to listen to other songs on this CD than just ""Sleep Now"" because that song is the only reason why I bought the album. I figured that maybe there would be another song that is even good enough to compare to ""Sleep Now"" but I couldn't find a single one. 50% of the songs are almost exactly the same. And the one song that I do like only lasts 2 minutes so I repeatedly have to listen to that one. Personally, I don't reccommend purchasing this CD."
3,not really the soundtrack,"Four of the songs on this CD, while good songs, weren't in the movie and songs that were playing up on the screen have been omitted. For example the really interesting french dance music during the closing credits isn't there. A soundtrack should be the soundtrack of the movie, not ""songs from and inspired by"". Otherwise OK I guess."
4,One of the best soundtracks I own,"After seeing the movie, I had to have the soundtrack. I loved the movie and the music inhanced the expierence ten fold."
5,A Milestone in Movie Scores!,"Trevor Jones became my favorite composer after I heard this album 4 years ago. His score is outstanding. The amazing thing with Jones is that he is capable to compose both brutal (like the main theme) and romantic (like #11, or the theme from ""Sea of Love"") cues that hook every listener. And I am not talking about just good music. I am talking about excellent melodies of rare beauty. The Dark City soundtrack is magnificent and worths 10 Oscars! Brutal, heavy, dramatic fully thematic and with the (virtual) orchestra at the last track giving a unique performance!! Buy it without hesitations. Jones score THE score of 1998!!"
1,Stay Away,"the product info suggests you get the desk, hutch and pedestal even showing a picture of them all. When the desk showed up without the hutch and pedestal, the rep from Homevisions blamed Amazon for the misrepresented product description and confusion. I ended up taking apart the desk and it wasn't until almost a month later that it was picked up. This company was terrible to deal with and the desk wasn't worth the price. Stay Away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Misleading Product Description,"My little girl loves the desk, but the product description is misleading. The hutch and pedestal are not part of the price . . . A little pricey for particle board furniture."
1,No go on Cheap Chinese knockoff,"This and seemingly all the batteries for sale today outside the real name brands are a scam. Read the few reviews on every battery for any of the laptops available here or anywhere on the internet, besides the OEMs and the folks like Duracell, Eveready, etc, are basically using cells that are rejected from manufacturing, purchased by these folks who make these knockoffs, and sold at a tremendous profit. They cost about $1 to make, are priced at about 50x that amount, last about 3 months if you are lucky, have no warranty.I've experienced several of these from laptops to cordless phones to iPods, and they all fail after a few months. I have had enough and am trying to tell others about this.I will now go and pay the exorbitant amount that Dell wants for a battery, but at least I get a 1 year warranty on it.Scott"
3,Excellent performances,"Anna Moffo had one of the loveliest soprano voices of this century. These arias from her long-overdue ""Beige Album"" are all performed excellently. She was equally adept in coloratura and lyric parts, and her high E's are just as beautiful as the rest of her range, including a warm, rich low register that could compete with many mezzo sopranos.Unfortunately, these songs all sound like they were recorded in a tunnel. RCA's ""Living Stereo"" releases, which include a lot of Moffo's work, as well as Leontyne Price and other well-known singers, seem to all have this problem. But if you can get past the echo, this is a wonderful album."
3,Different opinion,"I disagree that Moffo is the combination of Sutherland and Callas. In fact, she has never been in the same league. I view her as more like Leontyne Price try to be a coloratura soprano. Her coloratura arias are pale in comparision with the same ones by Sutherland in ""The Art of Prima Donna"". The best example is ""Bel raggio lusinghier"". It is obvious in this album that her technique was not secure and this is why she destroyed her voice so early. She was better in the lyric arias from Boheme and Turandot. Serafin's conducting was another problem. His pacing was not right for Rossini's or French operas. The sound was unbalanced recorded. If you are Moffo's fan or want to learn about Moffo's singing, buy it. But you will definitely find the same arias better sung somewhere else."
3,Not that great and very average,"I think the basic premise of this story is solid enough. Where it falls short is in the development of the storyline and its characters. For one thing, I think the main plot would've benefited if the story were a bit longer, allowing time to develop the relationship between Nevada and Eden and also adding more depth to the characters. In its current state, the characters seemed superficial and the story rushed. Most disturbing is Eden's discovery of her feelings for Nevada and after so little foundation on why that occurred. Eden and Nevada spend a lot of time together but the story skips through much of that and focuses on only sex scenes and sexy dialogue. For me, it leaves a lot to be desired.So, read this only if you can't find anything else better to do with your time."
2,I don't think so.,"Nevada meets Eden at a bar where she walks up to him thinking he is the owner of the store she needs supplies from. She is harassed and he defends. She goes to a cabin in the mountains to track wild cats and he follows days later to ensure she is okay. I won't say more as I don't want to give the story away. What I do not like is that she wears her heart on her sleeve and he, not a believer in love, takes what she has to give. He's got too many hangups constantly telling her he doesn't want to hurt her but does it every time and she is his doormat; always available to please him. I agree one hundred percent with review(er) from June 18, 2002. I will get bashed for this but I don't care, how can any woman lower herself to mush for a man who has told her time and again his feelings about love?"
3,Almost...,"I eagerly bought this book based on the reviews on this web site. The main characters have great potentional however the character development isn't there. Eden was raised in Alaska and is familiar with surviving in the wilderness, but other than helping Nevada out of a tight spot early in the book, the book doesn't follow through with this line. Nevada has burn out and takes it out on Eden. Of course if I wanted someone to leave me alone I wouldn't tell them I desire them? And Eden what is she a door mat? She puts up with Nevada's rudeness and keeps coming back for more. Finally the book doesn't go anywhere. The characters are limited to a small area and have few challenges. I didn't finish this book I was so bored. Lowell should take lessons from Linda Howard."
1,Is this a JOKE?,This is the worst piece of TRASH I have ever read in my life. A 100 page section of this two hundred fifty page book is ONE sex scene!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Give me a break! A thirteen year old could have written a better plot. I have read some bad books in my life but this takes the cake. I am astounded there is even one good review here!
5,You know you're hooked when...,"...when you let the kids listen while driving them to school, and then turning it up louder once they've left. ""Pirates"", ""Billie Joe McGuffrey"", and ""The Credits Song"" are great songs. While the movie score is missable, it doesn't detract from the rest of the album. Very catchy, but yet it doesn't get tiresome."
4,LOVE IT,"The first disc is okay, it's got a mad beat, though. The second disc is the BEST. I love every song on it."
2,Regurgitation of old material,"After publishing the best introduction to home brewing Papazian released this unenlightening tome. His snappy style, so essential in his first book, sounds dull and contrived. One third of the book is complete filler as he lists 60 pages of various beer styles along with their specific gravities, etc. This information could have been presented in a two page spread. Additionally, he offers little in the way of advanced brewing technique. The one saving grace of this book is the recipe section, with interesting ideas like a lambic barley wine and a raspberry imperial stout. If you are looking for a book that offers a firm overview of all-grain brewing then I can recommend 'Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide' or Noonan's 'Brewing Lager Beer.' Papazian's book will most likely be a complete disappointment."
3,Great for beginners,"As a new brewer, this book has more advanced information in it than I need at the moment. It will be a good reference as I progress through brewing and gain more experience. If you only have one book on brewing to purchase, get Charles Papazian's first book on home brewing."
3,More info on brewing beer,"This is Charlie Papazian's second book on the subject of homebrewing, following the in the footsteps of Papazian's immensely popular and useful debut, The New Complete Joy of Homebrewing. This book offers a lengthy guide to homemade beer, complete with reference material about the different styles of beer; how they are made, how strong they typically are, and other basics.Part of the reason Papazian's first book was so much fun was due to its writing style and humor. This, the follow- up, is more technical in nature and not quite as entertaining to read. It sticks mostly to the facts and leaves out much of the fun, making it a little more likely to induce sleep than inspiration. Nevertheless, this book is still useful as a reference tool and it does have some good beer recipes. Cheers!"

1,Very Disappointed,"I wanted a thermos type drinking cup that would keep my drink hot or cold. I put a cold drink in and even with ice it was warm in record time. It is now sitting on a kitchen shelf, never to be used again."
4,A small gem of an album,"This is a small gem of an album that deserves a wider listening audience. Chad Bault has constructed a set of fine songs driven by a solid flair for writing some high-quality lyrics. In the inevitable quest to `compare it to something' it reminds me somewhat of the early Joe Henry/Jayhawks collaborations. I would say that fans of strong songwriters like Richard Buckner, M Ward, Ryan Adams and John Darnielle will also find many appealing moments. A quiet, understated talent lurks within these songs."
2,BORING!,"This was by far the most boring book I've ever read. I only read the preface and was totally turned off by it. Seemed that the author just wanted to point out that people are stupid and he is very smart and the meaning and pronunciation of Kokopelli is wrong and all the novelty items are stupid and Kokopelli has been ruined by modern society.Frankly I don't really care, I just wanted to read about some history on the subject. I personally love the figure and felt that he was calling me stupid since I like the current version and what it has come to mean.I only skimmed the rest of the book but most of it was stories from natives and just more garbage about misinformation. I have to say, it seemed like he did a lot of research, but I would say it is mostly worthless when he presents it this way.Overall, save your time and find another book on the subject."
2,not what I thought it was....,"This is not what I was hoping for; this book extremely sexualizes Kokopelli and tho I am not prudish, I was put off by the content. Glad I didn't pay much for it."
4,Gracefully Doing the Job,"Best ballads is excellently made TOTO compilation in 1993 edited in Germany. It is fitting compilation for those who love TOTO ballad hits such as ROSANNA, 99, GEORGY PORGY. TOTO came about in 1978 pursuing progressive hard rock trend just as Boston, Styx, and Kansas did. But what made them big was their fourth album in 1982 featuring classic jazz induced hits such as ROSANNA, AFRICA and I WON'T HOLD YOU BACK. For most of the music fans they are remembered by excellent ballad tracks. This compilation includes almost all such ballad gems such as LEA, MAMA and ONLY YOU. Even less impressive tracks in their original albums had greater space here. Alas, it's a magic.This compilation suits wide range of music fans. Nice choice for a gift.--Track ListingsSecret LoveI'll Be Over YouAfrica99MamaSomewhere TonightTakin' It BackI Won't Hold You BackAnnaGeorgy PorgyLeaIt's A FeelingRosannaAngelaOnly YouOut Of Love2 Hearts"
5,Heartwrenching account of a family surviving abuse,"I am one of the ""children"" this woman raised. She has devoted her life to caring for kids no one else wants. This book painfully and poetically describes the two years after she discovered that the man she fell in love with and married was a pedophile. The trauma caused to the nonoffending parent is an overwhelmingly underdicussed issue. What happens to this family after the secret is out and they try to rebuild their dreams is not only maddening but a beautiful testament to courage, love and determination."
1,Deceptive and Dumb!,"Dre and Ed Lover are all the cover, but they are only in the film for a little bit. The two main characters are not even on the front cover. The scary-looking guy on the cover is a loan shark. That's pretty scary, but it's his cousin who is borrowing funds. Why the family disloyalty here? The film only moves to the Bahamas halfway into things. I really think many of the Island characters are Americans faking West Indian accents. The main characters are a rap duo who say they don't want to be exploited by record execs and then they very willingly get exploited. I love seeing actors of color get opportunities to enhance their resumes, but I have to stop giving PC points there. This is a substandard, dumb, uninteresting, poor-quality flick. It has very few redeeming features. Surely, even the most reclusive, misanthropic film viewer can find something better than this out there. And I was a regular watcher of ""Yo! MTV Raps"" back in the day, but muh boyz don't save this stinker."
3,Very disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed in this CD. Heard this gal for the first time on the radio and loved her. So I ordered this CD really looking forward to rocken out in my car on a road trip. The CD has only (6) songs on it. And the recording sounds like it came from the basement or garage. I mean really 6 songs?????? Still think she has an awsome voice. Being a singer myself I can appreciate her talent.I will order another of her CD's unless they all have only 6 songs on them, if so will stick to the radio."
5,Must have!,"This is an great cd by an awesome band. When I first heard CoB it was on this album and I was amazed. The musicianship is so good. If you're interested in anything by CoB I also suggest you try listening to other great bands like dimmu borgir, inflames and even cradle of filth. This band comprises excellent vocals, complicated guitar work and good use of the double bass pedal. I suggest that you get this album if you're interested in death metal, black metal, speed metal ,thrash metal or are just interested in a good change of music. IT ROCKS!"
3,Children Of Bodom - 'Something Wild' (Nuclear Blast America),"Good '98 debut CD from this Scandinavian metal outfit.Tracks that managed to sort of draw me in were ""Deadnight Warrior"",""Lake Bodom"" and ""Touch Like Angel Of Death"".Only downside here is that 'Something Wild' has a total of seven cuts,with a duration of 32 minutes.Is this like an EP?Either way,it should appeal to some fans of In Flames,Kreator,Opeth,Mercyful Fate and Iced Earth.They're currently on tour here in the states,as I saw them earlier this year.They put on a great live performance.Go see 'em!"
4,so close,"this cd is so close to being fantastic. the sound begins with ripping guitars along with beautifully orchestrated solos that seem to blend in perfectly with the songs. the drums blaze along at 1,000 miles a minute. the scathing vocals make you wonder if the singer is scarring his lungs. it would seem like the perfect cd....but then those keyboards...ugh! a great cd ruined by that irritating euro-techno keyboard sound. other than that...a great cd. if you can stand a little bit of the keyboards...i'd highly recommend this cd...a fantastic black metal release"
3,Pretty good stuff!,"I would call it a Stratovarius with black metal voice. It is good stuff, heavier than Stratovarius. And the voice isn't the classical black crow squealing but more like death metal or so."
2,very dissapointing,"I popped in a new cd called ""something wild"" by Children of Bodom. I heard beginning and thought to myself ""hell yeah!"" and was proud to be a metal fan once again. the power of the steel would triumph once again from the hordes of hell. but yet it was not so. after the wizardry i heard, the vocals began. this was quite the dissapointing experience!!!!! i could not believe my ears! i wondered how they could have such greatness and ruin it with the most terrible vocals I have ever heard. It was the most heartbreaking experience of my life."
4,Very raw album with stylistic polish,"So COB is my favorite band right now bar none. I liked Something Wild a lot, but it's raw, like any band's first CD. Despite this, the members of the band came from previous bands, so they sound like a well oiled machine, even though the writing is a bit scatterbrained at times. At least half the tracks are killer, and you can listen to them over and over and not get tired. Others like No Commands I didn't like because Alexi and what sounds like annother band member are fighting for the role of frontman, and it sounds like a mess. Alexi doesn't have the screaming and rhythm down in Something Wild, but when he gets it right, it's downright viscious. On this CD, the band already has the knack for writing melodies that grab your attention, but it's plagued by bass heavy chugging, and some OK production and EQing."
4,A wonderful picture of southern Africa,"I traveled in southern Africa in 1996 and found Martha's book to be a wonderful travel diary capturing the nuances of that part of the world. Her sensitivity to the unique tapestry of South Africa and Namibia as they struggle to embrace identities as free, democratic countries is very powerful. I didn't want the book to end. Bravo from a fellow WorldTeacher!"
1,Unbearable Harry Pottery Rip-off,"Need I say more? The writing is downright stagnant, the dialogue painful, the characters horrible (when they are characterized at all) and unlikable and the plot nothing that hasn't been done before. Considering reading this book? You may be more entertained by making up your own story while watching your laundry dry. Anything you can imagine regarding The Socks' relationship to Mlle. T-shirt will be more interesting than this amateurish slop-fest. In fact, there are erotic Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings crossover fanfics by twelve-year-olds that are more bearable than this book. If you think I am in any way exaggerating, read the first page."
5,Easy to Install!!,Bracket was easy to install and worked just as I hoped it would! Now my trailer cable is out of the way and won't get messed up being wrapped around the receiver!!
2,Doesn't fit like I expected,"I'll have to cut the plug end off and splice a different shaped plug end onto the existing wiring harness to get this to fit. There are several different shaped plug ends ( even from the same company),that make this product 'not so great'. Better pictures and description would be helpful.I would not recommend this to a person who is not 'handy' AND has a collection of discarded plug ends to work with."
3,Does the job,"This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately."
1,Does not include 4 wire connector or cap!,"I ordered 2 of these, 1 for each of my vehicles expecting to receive a whole wiring set up as seen in the picture but instead all I received was the plastic bracket. Then I looked and realized that the description says ""mounting bracket"" not bracket and harness. And this bracket does not fit every 4 wire flat connector out there so if you still want to order this, make sure you get it first, and then purchase the harness that fits in it."
4,Simple solution,A no holes required solution that can work with a simple mounting approach like heavy duty Velcro. At least until your are ready to drill...
1,doesnt work with my Tow Ready wiring cover,"It has a channel inside if for the cover's plastic connecting arm. It's very narrow and doesn't work with mine. I am not going to use it. I am getting the metal bracket that zip-ties around the Kurt hitch for my Nissan Xterra. And I don't want to drill into the steel bumper, that' asking for rust.Tow Ready 118525 T-Connector AssemblyCurt Manufacturing 13514 Class III Receiver"
4,"Works good, will need to pre-drill before using","Installed to bottom of bumper, pre-drilled holes and then screwed into bumper. Pretty simple, nothing complicated here, just make sure you get the appropriate 4-wire flat as it won't work with the Led 4-wire flat."
3,Good but not all the pieces are there,"Product mounts and works great with rounded edge wiring connector. While I expected that the connector was not included and thus ordered one separartely, I was disappointed to see that the connector cover was not included either, as the item descriptor does not indicate either way. Still worth the money, but come on, throw in the cover or put one in and raise the price .50."
2,"Dull, dull and... more dull","This book is not especially hard to get into, but finishing it really is a challenge. The whole plot centres around a group of alien beings who crashed on Earth in the thirtienth century and now a wealthy Englishman is trying to revive them, even if it means starting a nuclear war. A solid enough plot. However, its just the way it's done that I dont like. The aliens feature in it at only two points both of which are relatively short. If it wasn't for those two brief sections of the story you wouldn't know the plot even involved aliens and at times it seems to run independently of them. It does feel very Bondian at some points, especially in the parts involving the Russians and the Americans. Not a bad novel, just incredibly boring."
3,Doctor Who meets Tom Clancy,"I love Doctor Who novels. I love modern military and espionage novels. But I love the two genres for very different reasons, and they just don't mesh together well. It's an entertaining enough read, I suppose, but the book just doesn't seem to hang together very well and there are WAY too many false climaxes."
3,Solid story proves Doctor Who is still thrilling fiction,"A solid Doctor Who book which mesmerises the reader with an action sequence of James Bond proportions. The mysteries in the story are wonderfully built up and the character of Sam Jones fleshed out in surprisingly strong fashion. Never derivative or boring, Option Lock is a great introduction for new readers to a wonderful science fiction series."
1,DOUG MILLSTIEN IS OUT OF THIS WORLD,"This person cant write if his life depended on it, i read it and now used it for a door stop. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone. I might use it if hes lucky for my son to sit on at the dinner table."
5,my review,"I have read Firebrands and found it extremely useful. As a systems integrator in St. Louis, I have used this book to help my clients understand the importance of a technical infrastructure in building a vibrant brand.... Mind you, this is not a 60 second brand manager book."
2,Must be that sophomore slump,"When I first bought this about two years ago, I knew next to nothing about ""industrial"" music. I got Perversion because I heard the song Falling on the radio and thought that the song sounded a lot like NIN (used to like 'em alot). After listening to the CD it seemed that only Falling and Alive were standout tracks, the rest being filler. Then I put it away for a while. Later, after being introduced to ""industrial"" groups like KMFDM, Skinny Puppy, and Front Line Assembly; I listened to it again, fully expecting to hate it. To my surprise, it wasn't all that bad! Granted, I enjoy CD's by the aforementioned groups quite a bit more, I wouldn't call this a good or bad CD, just a bit mediocre. But if you like groups such as Stabbing Westward, NIN, or Filter then you would probably enjoy this."
4,"Great, not as much as the debut though","Many of these songs ARE great. It's much harder than their debut. The only flaw is what's been said: Making themselves a watered down product by making a sound similar to NIN.-- This one has mainly emotional, loud tunes. Alive's the closest thing to metal GK have done so far. And if you want Stabbing Westward-related tunes. Mainly like Ungod. Also blended in with a somewhat-similar to Orgy's Candyass. Mainly the songs like Fiend (if you own it you will know what I'm talking about).This is still high-quality. But here's my warning: I'm a hardcore fan, so maybe that's why I enjoy it so much. Many of the vocals weren't quite as whiper-tone, but still a bit of it."
3,"Un-original, but otherwise excellent","There is no use denying it: much of Gravity Kills's work sounds an awful like Nine Inch Nails. In fact, most of their songs are created in a format that parallels the song ""Head Like a Hole."" Although they may not be breaking new musical ground, ""Perversion"" is an excellent album to add to any rock collection. There is really nothing wrong with it and that's the bottom line."
5,Gravity Kills Rocks,"What you got here is failure to recognize good music. People try and compare bands these days to just about anything. The truth is this band went from their first album, which popped out three good singles which both hit TV and dance clubs. This band crossed two of musics most popular sounds and created one heavy hitting sound. From Mortal Kombat to TBS promos this band got through on their first and didnt disappoint on their second. Instead of trying to copy something, they built on what they started from. Making some of the guitars heavier and more dominant, while keeping the vocals and mixing where they should be and taking the beats to a newer level. This is a great album and one of the greatest follow-ups in music."
2,Maybe people don't know what 5 stars means. . . . .,"...So, what does GK offer here? Well, they do manage to rock out here and there, though their riffs sound VERY tired when they do. Besides the good lead singer, GK doesn't really have a distinctive sound. Every song, even the supposed ""showstoppers"" on this album, sound like industrial deja-vu. I guarantee it, even if you haven't listened to this album, you've already heard it all.So what do we have here? A wannabe industrial band, much like stabbing westward, riding on the coattails of Industrial's few commercial successes (NIN and Marilyn Manson). Nothing terribly interesting, but if you're not looking for something different, and your standards aren't too high, then maybe you should just go ahead and pick this one up, anyway."
4,First album was better... but..,"Perversion is a very cool cd... ""Falling"" is a great song to play loud! I didn't like the first album too much til i listened to it a bit... after listening to this more it should get better... check it out!! worth buying!! (unlike a lot of things.. ) hopefully they release a remix cd of Perversion like they did with there self-titled album..."
3,"Taking a ""Stab"" at NIN","These guys sound like Stabbing Westward trying to cover NIN songs, and since Stabbing Westward themselves are pretty derivative of NIN, you get a fairly watered down product. There's a part on ""Falling"" that sounds so much like ""Sin"" by Nine Inch Nails, it gave me pause. There's really nothing new here. That said, it's not really a bad album, per se. It's fine for what it is. If you're actually *looking* for a watered down Stabbing Westward doing a watered down NIN, then this will be the perfect album for you. It's radio-friendly and doesn't really push you to think or listen hard, or shock you in any big way, but it does get your feet tapping a bit."
3,hmmmmm.... i guess,"Well, if your like me you probably heard their first radio hit song.... (guilty).... and if like me you probably liked it. since then i havent heard from them nor purchased a cd. So i thought id give them a try.... I have to agree they sound very...i mean very similiar to NIN.... nothing wrong with that. But the music gets repetitive, id have to say the best song on this album is the last one.... Belief(to rust). But only because its very deifferent than the rest. If your in a rock out mood, then this cd is the answer, if your more into creativeness, then perhaps you should listen to something else.... all in all its a cd i can listen to, a few times get tired of it, and never play it again until im angry or drunk."
4,"Great Hip Hop / Rap CD, especially from a Christian artist","I'd have to say that most ""Christian"" hip hop and rap that I've heard is pretty bad. Even the best stuff is mediocre. But Grits really raises the bar with this disc and I was very impressed with it. The beats are fantastics and the lyrics, which can sometimes be silly/stupid on Christian rap CDs are great. There's even a Dirty South song, my favorite of the disc."
3,art of mediocrity,"There is no denying tha Grits has a significant amount of talent and potential as they have shown in the past with Factors of the seven, and Grammatical Rev. But this album finds Grits trying too hard to sound like the familiar southern artists like Outkast, and focusing less on making a good cd, granted there are good tracks but I personally as a hip hop fan was dissapointed with this effort"
5,GREAT CD,"""Art of Translation"" is a great CD. If you like hip hop/rap, you will enjoy this CD. They have some of the best rhymes in Christian rap, or mainstream rap, for that matter. My favorite songs are, ""Make Room"", ""Get It"", ""Believe"", ""Tennessee Bwoys"", ""Runnin'"", ""Ooh Aah"", and ""Here We Go"". Also check out ""Dichotomy a"" and ""Grammatical Revolution""."
3,Cool cd but whats up with the nose ring?,"The Art of Translation is the first Grits cd that I ever bought and I am very disappointed by their apperance. What is up with Bonafide's nose ring and two earrings? As a christian we are not to follow wordly standards and I am very disappointed by what I saw. It has shaken my view of them and I am not as keen on them as I was before.For those who are not phased by this the cd is cool but their past songs, in my opinion, were better. It has some good tracks like ""Ooh Ahh, Sunny Days, Believe and Running"" but the rest are not up to par.Please get rid of the piercings, its not cool! I know that we are all ""works in progress"" and that they should not be written off. God is working on them as with all of us but the piercings are still disturbing."
3,Not biblically sound....but its still a good album,"I listened to whole album. there were a few tracks that were ok...but for some reason this did not strike me as a chrisitan hip hop album . It was more positive hip hop than Christian. They did reference a few scriptures but that was about it. ""Slow down hold up, i want you to be mine, we can hook up and get married"" ummmmm sounds like a pick up line..rather than a good standing christian man approaching a christian woman.If I wasnt firm i nthe wood, then i would not have picked up and understand what they were trying to say versus Crossmovement and Christcentric, you don't have to decode their rhymes in order to find out if they are talking about Christ. It is in your face. That is what saves..not entertains!take care folks"
4,Mirror of Outkast,"These guys are very good, even though they are a christian group. From my experience alot of christian groups just don't cut it when it comes to producing hardline music, but Grits are a different story. If you like Outkast you would definatly like Grits. Check out Cross Movement, KJ-52, and John Reuben as well if you like Grits but these guys are very good."
3,"""Art of Translation"" album by GRITS","Well I got my cd ""Art of Translation"" by GRITS recently. I wanted it because the one song I wanted (Ooh Aah) was on there and it wasn't available as an mp3 on Amazon. The cd as a whole was okay, a few good songs here and there, and I got the song I wanted, but I wouldn't buy the cd if it didn't have that one song on there. Wasn't that impressed, but that's just my opinion I guess. Someone else might oppose my opinion. Probably just not my style of Rap/Hip Hop."
3,"Bach's Mass in b minor, R. Shaw Chorale and Orchestra","Normally, the music of Bach would warrant a rating of no less that five stars. However, Robert Shaw was able to over interpret and change Bach's greatest choral work to the point that it sounds Romantic. The articulations throughout are much too legato, in both the chorus and the orchestra, and the broad ritards at the end of each and every movement get tiresome. In fact, the tempos during the entire Mass are a bit too slow. In addition to this, Shaw takes the liberty of changing several chorale sections to small vocal ensembles sections. He obviuosly does this for dynamic contrast, but it is uncharateristic. The solo work however, is beautiful. Overall, the effect is somewhat enjoyable, but if you are looking for a recording that is performed in a true Baroque style, you will want to look elsewhere."
3,NOT a tint,I liked this chapstick. I liked the smooth feel going on and it stayed on pretty much all day. however..this is NOT A TINT. I was a little surprised to see how much color it actully had. it is more of a lipstick the a tinted chapstick. all in all I would recommed it as long as you understand your getting something heaver then tint
4,"works well, but I don't like the taste","I know it sounds weird, but this Avon Slick Tint really works well I just don't like the taste it leaves on your lips, you can definetly taste it...yucky, but It does gloss over your lips, nice and smmoth, I usually put on lip liner first then the Slick tinit and it gives my lips a nice sheer look and feel."
4,Chapsticky Lipstick,"This is not as sheer as i expected. It has the consistency of a melty chapstick. It smells like cheap lipstick and the rose color i bought was VERY pink. I haven't used it after the fist day. But if you like the color and a cute, moisturized matte look, then this is for you."
3,Great Tint,"I really like the color of this tint, it's a nice splash of color without being too shiny, or too bright that it looks like lipstick. I do not like the smell though, for the price it's kind of a given, a lot of inexpensive makeup items have horrible scents. For a better scent and some tint and shine I like MAC's Slimshine, smells like vanilla almost."
2,granny lip stain,"the only reason i like this is because it reminds me of the smell of my granny's lipsticks. the colour is not rose - more like a nasty pink. still, so cheap, it's worth the nostalgia"
5,funniest DVD i've seen in a while,this guy fd and man are wild. i never seen a dvd like this before. i watched this movie three times so far. im gonna get one more and pass it around the dorms at my college. people always steal my good dvds. this show rocks! if you ever need a cool white guy to act in the movies send me a email guys ahaha! *****
3,"Nice romance, but strange secondary characters.","I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars. The characters in Maddie's family were just goofy. I couldn't decide if it was the author's attempt at injecting humor or they were just strange. They reminded me of the movie ""Junebug"". It was distracting to me. I liked Chase. The mystery was pretty good, but the climax was a little over the top. Maddie's transformation was just too much too fast. Also, the whole plot of Chase being her 'angel' was more like a subplot. On the positive side, I could not put it down. I liked ""Now I See You"" a lot which was my first Tina Wainscott, so I will try another."
3,Her first,"Interesting in light of her later albums, but not truly representative of the unique Ciani sound. A good first effort."
5,Great groove for a french singer,"What a delicious voice ! Be sure, this singer will be the NexT generation and very nice style... Perfect version of ""If 6 Was 9"" from Jimi Hendrix"
2,Missing pieces,This movie is good but leaves much to be desired.The original movie had to be close to 5 hours long this one is only2 hours and 15 minutes. The original was played on TV in the late '80's and was a great 5 Star movie. This one is the cut version and leaves out alot of the story.
4,Christopher Columbus,"I love this movie. The music is great, acting and dialogue excellent. I am disappointed that much of the early part of the original was cut for this version. The original was two parts. This one is only one. Quality of sound a bit distorted also. Otherwise an excellent movie. Much more historical correct that others I have seen."
3,Impressively prescient,"The Cool War compliments another book by Frederik Pohl, The Merchant's War, and both depect versions of the future with weak governments helpless to contain forces of exploitation. This one anticipates how future wars will be undertaken through attacks that cannot be traced back to their source. The lack of accountability prevents retailation on any tit-for-tat basis, but soon enough everyone adopts that method and is undermining the stability and economy of every other power.Although none of the events depicted in The Cool War have happened yet, author Frederik Pohl nicely anticipates our excalation of terrorism, and he gives a wry fantasy about what the Mideast may do with all their money when the oil starts to run out.In the years since The Cool War was written, it has shown prescience, and it is valuable as a cautionary tale."
5,Sweethearts is a sweet album indeed!,"How delicious that the two superb singers on this lovely tribute to Macdonald and Eddy are actually married. Futral is well-known from her opera appearances in the US and abroad (she starred in Andre Previn's Streetcar Named Desire and as Baby Doe at City Opera, I believe), but baritone Steven White is less well-known. This seems odd, as the man has an utterly fluent baritone and he is spot-on in the style of Nelson Eddy: same masculine timbre and boy-scout-like sturdy diction. Reports in Opera News have it that this singer is also an opera conductor and is engaged now by many US companies--if true, and he stops singing, it's our loss, for sure.This is a darling collaboration, and the Newport label is to be congratulated for avoiding the cloying and yet not fearing to offer the listener some of the very best-known duos and solos which the operetta immortals brought us decades ago. Bravo!!"
4,"Dark, Real, and Worth Any Effort to Get","The self-described ""country noir"" of Gauthier (pronounced go-SHAY, by the way) plumbs emotional bareness you'd find at the core of country, from the perspective of society's misfits and outcasts. It's sometimes hard to imagine country's prom queens and hunka-hunks being credible with such emotion, but Gauthier's tangy/earthy voice leaves no doubt she could walk the walk. Gauthier's music is frank and unvarnished, and she has a knack for keeping the listener engrossed in the world of each song, whether charming or bleak. ""I Drink"" has an I-know-what-I-am reality, and the tale of former Texas death row resident ""Karla Faye"" and the marvelous lessons of ""Lifetime"" are must-listen songs. I'm also partial to ""Lucky Stars,"" a song about reaching an impasse that sonically echoes Linda Ronstadt's ""Long Long Time,"" and to the wonderful title track that talks about finding your people when you don't fit in where you are."
2,Misleading picture,I thought I was buying cologne in a glass bottle and it ended up being a plastic tube of cream. The picture was misleading
2,A story without feeling,"This book started out very well and went downhill quickly. Meriel and Nicholas fall in love basically from sight only. This is not love it is lust. Meriel is far from being a heroin. Granted her husband Robert was a villain but she committs adultery with Nicholas thinking Robert is a nice man and doesn't even know he is evil almost till the end of the book. I found the heroine selfish and lacking any trait I find desirable in someone I am supposed to be cheering for. There was almost no dialogue between Meriel and Nicholas which makes it difficult for the reader to root for the two to get together. There is much more I could say I found lacking in this book but in general, the feelings a reader should be able to share with the characters in the book were nonexistant."
4,Fiction embroidered on the tapestry of history,Characters full of human foible living in interesting times: two of the key ingredients in a great story.I enjoyed this novel immensely. The central relationship develops against a background of medieval history which showcases both without overwhelming either. I wanted to know more about the events of 1216 and I became engrossed in the characters whose story I was reading.Ms Chadwick makes medieval history come alive!Highly recommended.
4,Fast-Paced Fun Read,"I have read many works by Ms. Chadwick and have to say I particularly enjoyed this one. No one is talking deathless prose here, but for sheer entertainment this one fills the bill. Well-plotted, fast-paced and pretty much believeable, the book moves along at a bracing clip without faltering. Chadwick's period dialogue rings true and she succeeds better at portraying actual people - as opposed to cartoon sterotypes - in this novel than in some of her earlier attempts. This would be a good choice for airplane or beach reading as it demands little of the reader. As an aside, I never did figure out why the novel has this title. No ""Marsh King"" any where that I found?!!"
4,excellent read for medieval fans!,"I've read a few of Chadwick's books now and have become used to her excellent writing style. She had me hooked early in this book, and while Miriel and Nicholas weren't the most sympathetic of characters, I admired their ability to make it in such a rough world. The story, while well put together, was rather predictable. I figured out Robert early on, and wasn't surprised to find I was right, and I knew what would happen in the end. But that foreknowledge didn't stop me from enjoying the book. Its certainly one that brings this time period to life, and one that makes me once again wonder just what happened to King John's treasure!By the way, some reviewers complain about the lack of romance in this book. No, this isn't a historical romance,its historic fiction, which suits me just fine!"
5,"fantastic, fantastic 5 stars!!",Fantastic story and engaging story-telling. What I generally like about British authors and their style is their realistic approach to the plot and characters - no contrived plots or events happening because the author 'wants' to put her beloved characters in a 'good light'. Despite being a romantic tale it shies away from sentimental nonsense. This story is well told but my only complaint is that I would have liked the main characters to have more time especially at the end. The time they spent earlier in the book seemed furtive and 'snatched' so I would have liked more time for normal interaction. But all in all a strong story.
5,Pat Martino's best album,"In my opinion, this is Pat Martino's masterpiece. This is an album every jazz guitar player should have in his collection, although Martino's phrasing is very hard to imitate. The highlights of the album are ""Close your eyes"" - probably one of the best jazz guitar solos ever - and ""Park Avenue Petite"", a Benny Golson tune, played superbly by Martino."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. Of all the rich Scripture in the Bible that could really speak to children throughout their day, I found the choices these authors made were not what I would have chosen. The verses were a bit too deep for the type of lunch box encouragement I was seeking. Perhaps my children are younger than the intended audience, but I scrapped the book and I opted to make my own."
5,Powerful as a beast,"This is a very powerful book- well-written (as you might expect from a journalist), thorough, and interesting. It reminded me a little of Solomon's ""The Noonday Demon"" in that it was so well-researched and thorough. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is in any way interested in or affected by depression. Highly recommended. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
2,More than just depression/abuse,Felt like while reading this that the character of Thomas -she was completely to the end blind to the fact that he was an extraordinarily abusive man who caused her to have an emotional blindness to what he did to her. I feel he prolonged and intensified her depression and for whatever reason reading this book she fails to acknowledge and made excuses for him thru out. Her problems ran deeper than depression. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety amongst other conditions and am a male and feel she could have made this book a whole lot better if that was something she recognized and dealt with instead of sugar coating an obvious situation. I wish her well.
4,"excellent, easy to relate to book","I think that Tracy does an excellent job portraying her journey through depression, and that it accurately shows how a person viewed as ""normal"" by everyone surrounding them can actually have a multitude of problems. I have also read Prozac Nation, and I feel that although both deal with the issue of depression, Tracy's portrayl seems to be the kind of depression experienced by most people, rather than Elizabeth's all-out non-functioning type of depression. I found it very easy to understand and even to relate to because I, too, suffered from depression and am aware of the fact that you can live your life, and achieve many things of which you are proud of, but you can't appreciate your accomplishments because you are always trying to do better"
5,A gift that keeps giving,"The great thing about this game is that the recipient can use it as a game, for a fun family activity or a quiet stretch. One of my recipients has a 2 young kids, she uses the game to have a stretch, while the kids mimic the poses... the names are also fun for them to try to pronounce! They then love showing off their moves to whomever. I also have one of the more yoga shirts. They are great quality and they are very practical tops ie. they wear well, they go in the dryer and they are cotton."
3,stress,great addition to my library. glad i purchased it. worth the read. looking forward to other additions. love to collect.
4,interesting,"Hans was leagues ahead of time and his colleagues with his research. However, this book is sorely behind the times.For a much more up-to-date book covering the immune system and stress read Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, which is far more fun to read, too."
5,One of the best industrial singles ever released.,"The now-defunct Yelworc (of the German independant label Celtic Circle) only ever got around to releasing one single, the amazing 'Blood in Face.' Celebrated as one of the most uncompromising bands of the genre, it was unfortunate that the group didn't stick around long enough to enjoy the success they deserved. 'Face' is a cult classic and is widely regarded in underground circles as on of the best industrial singles ever released!"
4,Does not include their biggest hit!,"While this concert was very good, it did not include their hit, In the Court of King Crimson, which I suspect may be due to the fact that there are different members in this band. However, the dvd is still worthwhile."
1,cd review,The CD arrived was damaged and unplayable with a lot of finger prints. I was very much disappointed with the dirty cd.
4,A great supplimental teaching tool,This book teaches how to add your personality and other interactive techniques to your teaching. It teaches that it is a good idea to constantly up-date methods of presenting curriculum.
5,"Every Single Song is ""Heavenly""","Every single song in the album ""Heavenly"" is just -- what else can I say -- Heavenly. I listen to this CD every day and just can't get enough of hearing it. Johnny Mathis's voice is so very smooth and glorious.I have many albums of his, but somehow I think this is his very best, at least one of his very best and would recommend it to anyone who really loves beautiful songs with a beautiful voice to sing them.I hope Johnny Mathis never stops singing because he has been blessed with such a voice, as is reflected in ""Heavenly""rockymary"
5,a kindred spirit.,"This album is excellent. As it stands, Nexus Polaris is a shining example of black metal at it's best. The musicianship is excellent, and rather than try to fit in into a specific category of music, i simply let in all has to offer. Excellent guitar work, nice vocals (lyrics are printed in the insert), and female vocals that provide the sweetest backing. Hellhammer's drum work is incredible, and he shines through on every track. The keyboards provide a more involving atmosphere than anything i can remember listening to in a long time. And, to top it all off, it comes in a sweet package, with excellent artwork. This album is a fantastic collaboration effort between some of black metal's finest musicians, and i recommend it whole-heartedly to the music enthusiast. If i were to have anycomplaints at all, it would be that there mere 44 minutes of music it offers left me wanting to hear more. But as it is, its short & sweet. Sweet as hell. Buy it, or miss out on a shining moment."
5,An all time GREAT!!!,"I have been into the metal scene for over 15 years and can honestly tell you: if you have never listened to this please do! It is a work of art and one of the best albums ever! It's a bit different but that's what makes it interesting and truly enjoyable for repeat spins! Yeah, it's kind of old but let's admit some of the best material available is! Trust me: you will be glad you did!!!"
2,not so good...,"This record is full of great musicians.Well I don't say they don't play well, but something on this recording is missing.I can't describe what it is.And if you like this kind of blackmetal you should hear the following records:Bal-Sagoth Starfire burning upon the ice-veiled throne of Ultima Thule, Limbonic Art In abhorrence dementia...and so on...those records have what's misiing from this..."
5,A good album,"I bought this album, cuz it had a really great lineup in this album. Nagash(ex-Dimmu Borgir), Astennu(ex-Dimmu Borgir), Sverd(Arcturus), Hellhammer(Mayhem, Arcturus, and current Dimmu Borgir)and Sarah Jezibel Deva(Cradle of Filth, Angtoria). I love the album from the start. Sadly Nagash fired all the members and changed them for new ones."
3,"excellent album, but there's some WEAKNESSES in this album","i also like this compare, alongside with the greatest ORIGINAL black metal masterpiece, in times before the light.but, there's some weaknesses in this album i believe kinda destroys it:1. the music (keyboards probably) are TOO BOUNCY. i think this is nagash's sign of transition, but i dunno. no black metal band should have bouncy beats.2. nagash needs to write better lyrics.3. that GODDARN lady from COF is in it. i rather skip forward instead of hearing her.again it's a good album, but it'll be even great if the ""above mentioned"" are removed, but unlikely."
2,Redundant and overrated,"Covenant (the Kovenant)'s music always seems to be about 5 years too late. I relize this came out in 1998, but for it to be as great as everybody likes to proclaim, it should have come out in 1993. It's as cheesey as old man's child, with its bouncy beats and monotonous, directionless drumming. Keyboards don't stand out much either, so for anybody to commend it bewilders me. Even The Kovenant's new material is outdated. Nagash (aka Lex Icon) needs to learn how to write for the future, not what's popular right now. because by the time it gets out to the market, everybody's already been there, done that. I give it 2 stars because i do enjoy the album, its just not revolutionary like i've been told."
3,Beautiful red rug,"This rug color looks a bit different from the photo. The photo is brighter than the actual color and the rug is thinner than I thought. But again, can't expect too much for the $ paid. Wish they delivered it without rolling it as when unrolled, it bends in the corners and takes a bit of work to straighten them. Again, that is a minor inconvenience."
2,The actual picture and the online pictures are different. The online picture is very bright and the actual rug is durker than th,The actual picture and the online pictures are different. The online picture is very bright and the actual rug is darker than the online picture. It is also very thin. The customer service was very very good.
5,Fantastic !!!!,"I just got mine for Christmas, I'll say i have never had a shave that close befor. In fact my face was not this smooth as a child. I love this razor. Now at first be prepared to cut your self due to how heavey it is but you will soon get used to that. Then you will love it too. Besides it is built to out last me."
2,Bizarre...,"Ayant lu 'Folle', j'ai voulu lire 'putain' et je dois dire que j'ai été déue. Je n'ai pas compris ce qu'elle essayait de dire à travers son récit. Que devrions nous comprendre ou retenir de cet ouvrage? Je me pose encore la question..."
3,Putain,"Putain de Nelly Arcan est l'histoire d'une femme escorte à Montréal. Cette femme fait la narration de l'histoire du début à la fin. À la parution du livre, plusieurs se demandaient si c'était une sorte d'autobiographie de l'auteure... je crois que ce roman se veut comme une semi-autobiographie de Mme Arcan et aussi un ouverture sur ce que peut vivre une escorte/prostituée à Montréal.Ce roman a un bon début mais ne semble jamais décoller. À la fin de la lecture, ce n'est qu'une longue narration sans vraiment avoir trop de chair à l'os pour nous accrocher."
5,I'm a musical instrument player and listener,"I've had this CD (before I lost it. Now the CD is no longer lost in space, but LOST IN MY ROOM LOL)But I've listened to the music, I'm not really big on the Techno, but the music was a bit interesting. Then there was the musical composition part. Now that really makes your imagination go wild to what imaginative movie you create fits with this kind of music. It's strong and fast paced in a few. My favorite track is the first composition track. It makes it's intro lightly and makes a bold touch as it reaches further into the score. Then there's the others which I'd rather leave to your imagination. If there were 10 stars I would give it 11 cause it happends to be my favorite composition since the Abyss."
1,I Tried to Listen to it...But I gave up,"I used to like this cd. I gave it 3 months and I gave up because this CD focuses on electronic music and I don't get the music in this soundtrack. Instead of putting electronic bands, They should've put bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, Deftones, Soulfly, Coal Chamber and Marilyn Manson in this soundtrack. If you are not a fan of electronic music, don't buy it."
2,"Ok, but only 4 good tracks.","This CD only has 8 real song tracks, and only 4 of them (2, 3, 4, and 7) are especially good. Those 4 are worth having, but then you're paying a lot of money for only 4 songs!! I think the Mortal Kombat, Strange Days, and Mortal Kombat Annhilation compilations are much better."
2,This soundtrack was pretty good but could have been better.,"The reason I give LIS only 2 stars is because of tracks 2-7. I really enjoyed tracks 1,8 and 9-19, but I was disappointed that so much instumental music from the movie was left out. I thought that the techno tracks were too long, repetitive, and frankly irritating. I do like some techno, but this was bad techno. I think that this soundtrack should have been released as two separate CDs. One with the techno, and one with the instrumental music, like the Batman releases."
4,Marvelous solo debut but do beware.,"""Pacific Coast Highway"" was recorded in January of 1991 and was released shortly thereafter. Those who enjoyed his music with Tangerine Dream can forget about getting any of the dynamics. Instead, expect a very beautiful adventure with haunting, almost romantic sounds ranging from the sunny Pacific Mood of ""Wheels on The Beach Park"", ""Big Sur Romance"" and ""Driving Into Blue"". On the other hand, the album takes a much more dramatic direction with ""Lontano Mystery"", ""Black Garden View"" and ""Cinnamon Park"".This album though was re-issued a few years later as ""Enchanting Nature"" with some of the tracks moved there and others altered, and the remaining actually unchanged except in their titles. If you have ""Enchanting Nature"", you decide if it is necessary to purchase ""Pacific Coast Highway"". I happen to have both and have no regrets about it then again it may as well be more of a completist mentality on my part."
1,"DO NOT BUY, DANGEROUS MISSFIRES","I am the Safety Manager for my company, and we bought this nailgun to replace a PorterCable that we had for a few years, 3 or 4,. We recieved this nailgun and their nails. The nailgun sparks every time it fires a nail, sometimes it does not fire a nail, and other times it fires 2 nails. We used this nailgun for 2 days, on the second day, it missfired and shot out two nails. One went into the intended 2 X 4, the other went into the left hand middle finger of the man that was using it. After investigating the incident, he was not miss using the gun, the nailgun just simply shot 2 nails. So, if you buy this gun, PLEASE be extreamly cautious with it."
4,Grizzly Framing Nailer--Good Value,"I recently purchased this Grizzly framing nailer after contacting Grizzly technical help to confirm the size of nails that the tool will handle (the manual says 0.113 in. shank diameter, and I wanted to use larger nails at 0.131 in). The technical help people confirmed that the product would handle the larger diameter, so I bought one for $100. I have only used it to drive a few nails so far, but I am satisfied. It does seem to have some inconsistency in the depth to which it will drive the same size nails in the same wood, but that might be me more than the tool...I am still learning to use it. Bottom line: good tool for the price!"
2,"ONLY takes up to 0.113"" nails","I just received this item, and it DOES NOT take up to 0.131"" nails. It only states up to 0.113"" but Grizzly says it will shoot up to 0.120"". The nails sold by Grizzly in the 20-22o range are 0.113"" nails. I think this is deceiving, and Amazon shouldn't link to nails that don't fit this gun."
5,Poetry for Women,"Although I am not a fan of poetry, I did greatly enjoy this book. The verses do not require the reader to take them apart to try to find the hidden meaning. When you read each verse you feel it directly from your heart."
2,Do not buy this one.....,"I have 3 different CDs of Rach's Piano Concerto no.2, they are Sviatoslav Richter's, Horowitz's, and Rachmaninov's. I've listend to Ashkenazy's,too, and this is the worst version I've known(Thank God my classmate owns the Ashkenazy's, not me).I think Ashkenazy didn't know what Rach tried to say in this famour Piano Concerto, maybe he has a very astonishing skill, but this is just not enough.If you are looking for a Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto no.2, I'd say ""do not buy this one, try the Richter's or Rachmaninov's."" (The Richter's is too deep, I cried when I listened to it in the first time, and Ashkenazy's is too light, not suitable for playing this concerto)"
5,An Emotional Account of Internment,"As much as ""Three Came Home"" is a story of war, it is a story of love. Mrs. Keith's love for her husband and son are paralleled with her hatred of internment. She balances the good in people, even the enemy, with the bad. The clear message is that war is what makes people bad. I enjoyed this book. It is beautifully written, with every sentence eliciting some kind of emotion in the reader. Mrs. Keith is an admirable woman for her literary accomplishments and her ability to share her experiences on a very personal level."
5,An Excellent Handbook,This book is an exceptional follow up to the fluid dynamics publication by the same author. The material in this text is presented in a very straightforward manner which any mechanical engineer should be able to comprehend and apply. This is a must have for the engineer who wishes to design functional fluid thermal systems. This is my second copy.
3,"Review of ""Design of Fluid Thermal Systems",Above Average review of thermal fluid fundamentals. Recommended for the beginning pipeline engineer.
2,Littered with errors,"This book had so many errors (ie. typos and incorrect formulas) that we were told to use the formulas from another book. Some of the examples are useful, and the step-by-step instructions are a great start for certain types of problems."
2,Lacking of explanation through out the book.,"The exercises do not have the answer for students to check their work. In the examples showed in the calculation part, there are no unit show and make the students confusing on how the calculation work. For example, in ideal gas equaltion, the book shows pv = mrt which m stands for mass. It is confusing. The rest of the book is okay but it needs to be edited again."
4,"Fun, foot-stomping festival music from Columbia","A mixture of Cuban, Spanish, and African influences swirl through ""La Candela Viva."" The female vocalist is vibrant and fiery.The track ""El Pescador"" alone is worth the price of the disc."
1,Rubbish,"I figured that I might try this out but as these types of movies are pretty stupid, this one will not disappoint.All I take back from the movie is a nude chick walking around constantly and weird people/images. I guess if you had one too many LSD hits, you might actually know what is going on here, otherwise a normal non-drugged person would just scratch their head and go WTF?Good Luck....Id suggest renting as I did, rather than buying this tripe."
1,Terrible Horror,"This has to qualify as one of the worse films I have ever watched. What was it? It appeared to be a bunch of bad, ugly scenes, pasted together to give the lead a chance to show off her attributes. The sloppy visuals were accompanied by poor sound and poor to non-existing dialog. Time and money were wasted on this one."
2,Picasso Drawings,Illustrations are not high quality but the book is satisfactory overall as the text is fairly good. But it is not a book I would have bought had I looked through it first.
5,My fav...,"If you enjoy the arts, colonial history,Greek mythology, drama...it's in there...Keneally weaved all these teams brilliantly to create a masterpiece in my opinion."
5,Adult Adoptee Endorses This Book,"As an adult adoptee, I can say I needed this book when I was younger. The title is deceiving. It tackles all the issues adoptees and even foster kids can relate to. I wish my parents had done these ceremonies with me. Some of them would have helped a lot. The ones around fear, loss, transitions, and self-esteem would have been especially helpful. Get this for your family today -- don't waste another minute thinking about it."
3,Neglected,"As all fans know, this is a third/last season episode. Trrue Trekkies have little good to say about this episode and I agree it is far from perfect but it has some of the nicest visual effects of the series.The acting is Monday-morning-terrible and the whole production is uneven but this is far from the worst episode. There is an effort and an interesting story, though it seems crammed in a 45 minute network show.This story might have been better utilized and expanded in a feature film but who will ever know.For Trek fans only. It deserves a second viewing."
1,Third Season Slump Continues,"As I mentioned earlier, Season Three entered a slump starting with Wink of An Eye. Unfortunately, That Which Survives is even worse than Wink of An Eye and it continued the Season Three slump.This episode is clearly in the bottom ten. Spock is so mean. I wish Scotty would have jettisoned Spock into space. The acting is just plain awful and unnecessary scenes were added just to fill time! Spock is not the only one being mean. Kirk destroys Sulu every time he opens his mouth. It was only after Sulu almost died that he was nice to him. I want to say this is the worst of the series but there are a couple of episodes that are even worse."
2,"Not as bad as Spock's Brain, but.....","As already noted, this one is a forgettable Trek, to be sure. But somehow, Trek, even when it is bad, is still pretty good.Outside of a few good moments, such as Sulu firing his phaser at Losira's feet (pretty good explosion FX), and the nifty way the holograms disappear, this one blows pretty badly. Still, it's better than the latest reality drama, or any episode of ""Lost in Space.""Watch this one instead of the next ""WWF Smackdown"" -and save your brain."
5,Heavenly Balm!,"This is THE best body cream I have ever used! It leaves your skin so soft and makes you feel so good, and of course the gardenia scent is one of my favorites so that is an extra bonus. When you apply this, your skin soaks it up like a sponge, and used every night it will soften any rough spot - even your heels! Absolutely wonderful!!"
1,Historically inaccurate,"As an avid reader of books about the War of the Roses and the Tudor dynasty, I found this book a trial to finish. It is so filled with historical inaccuracies that I winced a dozen times while reading it. Although not very well researched, it did have many contemporary quotations that I found interesting, but that is the only complimentary thing that can be said about this work."
3,20 piece lotr set NO LEGOLAS!!,"All the figures look great but the description from toys r us is not right. To start, there is no Legolas at all. There is no pony for Merry therefore he is not on pony. Anyway, WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE IS WHAT YOU GET! Everybody looks good but again there is NO LEGOLAS and it would have been nice to atleast get a Gandolf & Smeg."
2,Warning to Serious Collectors!,"Great series of LOTR figures.sadly, they are not in a display box, or packaged for retail! if you are a serious collector, skip this! it comes in a white box, open it and out come the figures. good for kids who want to play with them. bad for investment potential."
2,awfull,THIS IS BAD REALLY BAD IN PLASTIC NO DISPLAY BOX NOTHING FOR THE PRICE I EXPECTED MORE.MY DAUGHTER WILL LOVE IT AS SHE LOVES LORD OF THE RINGS BUT I FEEL THE PRICE SHOULD BE MUCH LESS AND AMAZON NEED TO SORT THIS ONE OUT
4,Works well,The cans don't keep their compression forever. Nonetheless they're a better option than carrying a big ol' can of compressed air everywhere.
3,Use it if you do not care about warrenty of your tire.,"I had flat tire yesterday. I thought towing the vehicle to costco will take more time, brought the the fix a flat from local store. It worked great, we could able to drive to Costco.But things went wrong from there, Costco refused to fix the flat due to use of fix a flat.Warranty on tire is void, I was asked to buy new tire for $107. ???Yep, if you have warranty on your tire, many tire companies denies to fix it after this.However if you have old tires does not worry about any warranties on them.Or your in urgency not able to tow the vehicle, this things works for 4 to 5 miles, may be more time."
4,"Worked for me, but have a rag handy","Got a flat from a slow leak and no spare, so I picked up a can of this stuff. I followed the directions and made sure to drive around immediately for about 3 miles. Then I brought the tire up near pressure and it's holding, so I'm sold.The thing is, when you remove the product hose from the valve stem some of the goop will ooze out, even with all the pressure of the can released. I had a rag handy but still got a bit on my hand. Nasty gasoline odor that evaporates very slowly. So make sure you have a rag for cleanup and wear a disposable rubber glove."
1,Didn't work for me,"I had a tire puncture in the tread from a roofing nail and used fix-a-flat to try to fix the leak. After one can didn't do it, I added a second can, which still didn't fix it.Fix-a-flat guarantees that it will work or your money back, but they make you mail the empty can(s) to them. Okay, so I did that, but Fix-a-Flat never did send me a check. From my experience, their guarantee is worthless."
1,A Warning before you use Fix-A-Flat,"This did fill up my tire. The problem lies when I tried to have it patched afterward. ALL the places that I called refused to repair my tire with the Fix-A-Flat in it. To quote the guy at Firestone, ""Always use the spare. I'm sorry I can't help you."" I now must buy new tires for my car. Thanks Fix-A-Flat!"
5,Dan makes it home,"After giving us two awesome acoustic cds, dan comes back with a DANdy. This studio album is complete and by far the best country music I have heard in the last few years. It is strong from top to bottom. Angels Eyes leads the way with many other great surprises along the way. How about LRB's Reminiscing? Very Nice! Every song is a great listen but Blessed is the best. What range Dan has on this one. You have got to hear it for yourself. He still has that powerful voice from his England Dan days. This is true country music with feeling and heart. Some country is cool."

1,I never really liked this album,"I bought the debut album from German Heavy Metal band Primal Fear when it was first released in I think 1998. Before I heard the album I heard a song from a sampler. The song sounded like songs on Painkiller from Judas Priest. Although not as good as Painkiller, I decided to buy the album. When I listened to the album a couple of times the songs sounded ok. After that I started to dislike the album more and more. There are various reasons why I dislike the album. First of all I totally hate the high vocals from Ralph Scheepers, secondly the song are very simple and become boring very quickly and finally I started to dislike the whole traditional Heavy Metal scene. (The music not the people.) The weakest song on the album is probably ""Formula One."" Mainly because the lyrics are not very strong. I can understand that fans of traditional Metal like this album/band. If you are looking for more complex or original music, then look for something else."
2,Generic power metal,"Mna, thje grade of innovation here is near to ZERO. This is nothing more than another generic German power metal band, filled with double bass drums in all the songs, the obligatory bonus track (this time BREAKER, from Accept - this was a GREAT band!). Also, Scheepers vocals su..k, they are horrible."
4,European Power Metal Bliss,"Strong Judas Priest influence here with a bit of Helloween for good measure. Sure, this album isn't exactly groundbreaking but the songwriting and playing are top notch. If you like 80's style power metal than check this out."
2,not good for older children,"I purchased this product because it seemed like it would be a good option for my toddler (22 months old - and small for his age). However, this is very cumbersome to use with a larger child. I see the benefits of using it with a small child, so I will keep it for the next child."
1,Handbook - Not,"Handbook is a very scholarly peice of work. The intent of the book, its audience, or possible use is not clear. It does not analyze how nations acquire CW weapons, nor details CW proliferation history.The focus is on a series of notable events involving CW weapons by the developing world (not all inclussive). Many times the points being made is the difficulty in assessing what is really happening elsewhere in the world, and the various inaccurate perceptions made at the time of events (hind-sight).So if it is not a handbook, what is it? Perhaps a scrap book of a few CW weapon events in the developing world."
5,I loved The Golden Locket.,The Golden Locket was alot of fun to read. The character development was excellent. The dialog seemed so real. I loved the ending. The author has a wonderful imagination.
1,If this story had a moral,"If this story had a moral it would be ""The end justifies the means."" I found very little in the story that relates to real life and a lot that does not. I would advise any mother of young girls not to buy the book for their daughters."
2,"cool, but holds very little ink","It's a cool concept, but the pen is slippery to hold, and has a very small ink reservoir. Mine ran out of ink in a few weeks of sporadic use."
3,not knowing how many pens I ordered,"I really like the pens but when I ordered them I thought it was going to be four pens but I found out that 2 pack meant 2 in a pack, not 2 packs."
5,I'm happy!,"Wow! Good, Good, Good condition! This is an awesome pen and I am very pleased with it. Thank you so much!"
5,The Power Of Prayer,"This book has been very inspirational to my teen and myself. We read it together and discuss how the power of prayer can influence any situation. Cheri Fuller has done a great job. Each chapter is a testimony of how teens have made a difference through prayer. Also, at the end of each chapter are God Links which give teens strategies and ideas on how to connect with God and pray more effectively. This is a great tool to read with your teen!"
2,Sent the wrong color item,"The bag I ordered from the Amazon page was clearly blue, and though the description mentioned the word ""natural,"" I didn't think anything of it. When the bag arrived, it was a totally different color from the one in the picture. In fact, it wasn't a Bean Product bag at all but a Natural Fitness bag that I could have bought from any store. I was ready to go through the hassle of returning it, but luckily the person I bought it for didn't mind. I was really disappointed. I'm even noticing now on this page that the ""Item being reviewed"" picture is not the original picture I saw OR a picture of the product I received. Next time I'll order from the company directly so I know what I'm getting."
4,"Enjoyable and yes, graceful","Came across this book when a friend recommended it, and like many previous reviewers, I enjoyed it.It is the story of Grace, a 30ish English teacher in a small Texas town during WWII. The writing has a lovely, bittersweet quality as most of the characters find out that what they were looking for was perhaps not really what they wanted from life. And of course, being set in WWII time period, the war is a constant presence in the characters lives, motivating, changing, and devastating some of them. Perhaps that's why the author chose her ending - to leave the story on an upbeat note.Overall, an enjoyable book."
3,Not As Graceful As I'd Hoped,"I did enjoy the book. I read it for a book club, but might have read it on my own. My biggest problem was the way I met Grace. In the first chapter she has already slept with a man who isn't her husband and on the night of his wife's death. It just put a bad taste in my mouth. I never grew to like Grace Gillian, but I did grow to tolerate her, because I enjoyed the story."
5,Dorothea Lange,"Dorothea Lange: Photographs Of A Lifetime (Aperture Monograph)Dorothea Lange provides us with a great insight into the human condition and the state of humanity. Her photographs are timeless works of excellence. Anyone interested in photography, history or humanity will find her work compelling."
4,Condition of book.,"The book was great, the condition that it came in was not. The cover was bent and the binding torn. It was suppose to be a new book!"
2,Looking for a Script,"The welcome presence of Ben Gazzara (in his final starring role) cannot save this meandering, underwritten comedy-drama. ""Looking for Palladin"" (2009) goes nowhere slowly - though the offbeat cast and Guatemalan locations provide some interest. A disappointment from Polish filmmaker Andrzej Krakowski."
2,Not the best movie I've seen,"I am a huge Ben Gazzara fan. Had a crush on him ever since ""Run for Your Life."" After he passed away a little over a year ago, I thought I would see some of his movies that he made when he was older. This one, I did not at all like the character of the other lead actor. The actor did a good job; I just didn't like the character he played. Most annoying. Ben, as always, was fantastic. Liked the plot, and the scenery, however."
5,Italianamerican:The Scorsese Family Cookbook,I have been looking for this cookbook for almost a year! What a pleasure to find it. My husband is of Italian decent and I have started a catering business with emphasis on southern Italian cooking. These recipes will enhance the ones taught to me by my husband's grandmothers and aunts and my own mother-in-law. This has made my day.ChefBove`
4,A Fun Guide To Modern Banks,"This beautiful 160 page softbound book features 100's of full color pictures of every type of modern bank. Topics include, Advertising Character, Historical and Patriotic, Holiday Characters, Movie Characters and Celebrities, Prime Time TV, Comic Book, Disney, Hanna Barbera, Warner Brothers and more. A complete alphabetical index makes item location easy. There is a brief introduction to the collectible. Prices are 1997 values. Useful reference."
5,"Mesmerizing, strong drama","Marlo Thomas is great in this. It's a true story about a father being sued by his kids for child abuse and incest. Very strong material handled well by all the actors. A great, solid drama."
5,Windows Server Hacks,Amazon continues to deliver quality used books at reasonable prices. The book was as advertised and came promptly and on schedule. I have purchased many books this way including out of print books and have never been dissapointed.
3,"Overall a good reference, but needs more examples","I had a need to run a .exe file on a remote machine. So I typed in the ""ExecuteAll.vbs"" script example from page 27. The script runs and prompts me for the information. But the command I feed to the script never executes on the remote server. The command can be run manually on the remote server. So I know the command is good. I even tried the command that's shown as an example and even that didn't work.Overall the book is good. But more examples of different ways to utilize the scripts in the book would be a plus."
4,Good book....but mislabled?,"The definition of ""hack"" is as follows:To write or refine computer programs skillfully.To use one's skill in computer programming to gain illegal or unauthorized access to a file or network.This is a good book.....the name should be changed, however, to ""Windows Server Shortcuts and Tricks""....not ""hacks"".The book has many good tips, tricks and shortcuts to make life easier for the administrator. I'm always buying books to make sure I am as knowledgeable as possible. This book has good information for my daily job tasks and I recommend it. But I was surprised not to find any ""hacks"" per se.....something using NMAP or another program used to attack NetBIOS....this is not THAT kind of book."
2,very dull translation,"I wont say anything about correctness, but in the end Ahmed Ali has been unable to convey the profound tone any of our holy books has, and definitely Kur'an does too. The English is not in the least exciting or moving.. Finally the edition is a poor one, a uselessly big book, hard to handle when its paperback like mine.."
4,Wonderful,"This music is simply wonderful. Charmaine has a beautiful voice, and the style of the music is unlike anything I've ever heard before. The music really brings you into the presence of God. It's great worship music. You must buy this CD! It's great!"
3,"Interesting Read, but Needs More Focus on Implementation","I found this book to be an interesting read but was ultimately left disappointed because the book does not provide much useful information about implementing non-linear pricing models, particularly for use pricing securities, options, or derivatives. The author is absolutely on the mark in his discussions of the flaws underlying the majority of financial economics theory. He also clearly has applied these approaches because the book includes numerous insightful comments and observations. I recognize that nonlinear math can be very difficult and that many valuable insights can be obtained without a detailed understanding of the math. However, the author could (and should) have provided greater coverage of the math. I would have liked to have seen coverage of the math necessary to implement fractal brownian motion into simulations or pricing models."
2,Would not spend the time/money on it again,"I was/am looking for a good book about the topic of nonlinearities and the limitations of standard finance theory. This book isn't it. One reviewer said he's redundant. To be more blunt, he's a windbag (harsh, but true). It's as if every major idea or book in econ/finance/physics/biology that's he ever read/heard of is riffed on in this book. (Doubt that? Click on ""read and excerpt"" and try to make yourself read it all the way through.) Which would have been good, if it were all done in context, but context in this book can be hard to find. Also, his critique of standard finance theory (which deserves a thorough critique) would be more credible if he didn't make some technical mistakes in describing it."
1,"Redundant, superficial, innacurate and expensive!","I was truly disappointed with this book.The book is highly redundant. The author keeps repeating the same things over and over again. At the same time, it is more or less obvious that the author either doesn't fully understand nonlinear dynamics or didn't know how to explain this subject in a more rigorous way. Sometimes, the author seems to be carried away by mysticism as if nonlinear dynamics had anything to do with religion or gods.If you want to read a good introductory book about complexity theory, read John H. Holland's ""Hidden Order"". If you want to read a good book about fractal market dynamics, read Edgar E. Peters' ""Fractal Market Analysis"". Forget about ""Nonlinear Pricing"". It will save you precious time and money!"
1,Completely Useless,"Optimistically I bought this book expecting an insight into non-linear models of price behvaiour, maybe some thoughts I could use to flesh out my own experience - a peek into other approaches to managing price volatility perhaps. What I got was a rehash of technical analysis with a glaze of chaos theory. Don't bother."
5,Increase returns and reduce risk.,"Nonlinear pricing provides a refreshing new look at the ways in which we measure risk and return in finance. The value to the investor is not in how much you can make relative to a benchmark, but in how safely you can make your returns. If you can predict pricing behavior in the markets more accurately, you have a tremendous advantage."
5,Great Product! Fish absolutely love it!,Great Product! Fish absolutely love it!This product is great for use in the Eheim automatic feeder. It keeps me from wondering if I fed my fish.
2,Floats,"These pellets float around on top until they get caught up in enough current from a powerhead to get pushed under. Specifically wanted a sinking pellet, I would not buy again. My fish seem to like it, some just don't get much to eat because they are too skitish or its against thier nature, to eat from the surface."
3,try them out live,these guys will throw one hell of a live show at you. but these studio recordings are No Where as good.
5,germ in sf,"This is an excellent album! Technical, tight, fast and raw. What all new punk rock should aspire to. I can't wait for the next album to come out. They also put out a really cool video for the song ""Wyoming"" using Jim Henson characters. I went to a show, and they said something about Sesame Street trying to take them to court. Buy this album!!! You won't be disappointed if you love punk."
2,Overindulgant,"Somewhat of a new take on a familiar subject, Brown obviously is intimate with southern history and its unique culture, manners,myths, and mores."
5,High Hearts,"I throughly enjoyed this novel! Unlike most books on the Civil War this one is from the women's point of view. How did the war affect everyday life for all the levels of Southern society? Women in the military, not as ""comp followers"", which is the usual point of view but as soldiers fighting on the front lines. Women in the hospitals working under extreme conditions and performing duties thought of,at that time,as very ""unwomanly"" nothing that a well bred female should even be contemplating. Geneva Chatfield Hart, the main charactor, is a strong, intelligent very capable woman. Lutie Chatfield, Geneva's mother, is another strong woman who finds her strength in the trials and hardships of war time. Sin-Sin & Ernie June,slaves on Geneva's VA home planatation, both strong and powerful women. The depictions of both the rural(plantation) and urban( Richmond,VA) lifestyles are rich and full bodied. This book is a good read so sit back and enjoy yourself."
4,Great Follow Up,"I'll attempt to rate without any spoilers. The story is a great follow up to the Brilliant Else Worlds story ""The Nail."" If you have read The Nail, read this follow up."
4,Enjoyable sequel.,"This expands on the events of 'The Nail', and anyone who enjoyed that excellent volume will need this too."
5,Very Good,"We have several aquarium tanks and a small pond populated by cichlids. This food is perfect for them. We do have some live plants that we add to the tanks, but we are persuaded that the food itself would be enough. One very big plus is how little mess this food leaves behind; maybe the fish just like it and eat it, but the tanks are much cleaner. We like it!"
3,Disappointment,"I bought this product & I liked the look of it. I had previously purchased a single aero-bed. The single bed sprung a leak after about 4 months so decided to replace it with the full-sized aero-bed. Unfortunately, after one month, it, too, sprung a leak. It didn't come with any patches so for now, I reinflate it every two hours for my disabled friend. He only uses it on weekends at my office so I can live with it for now."
3,Need raised one?,"It looks very attractive on photo, but, after trying this one and another 6 inches inflated bed (as floor mattress), all users voted for the lower one.The high raised one feels like you are on a water-bed, more or less. The equipment has easily inflating attachment, so no problem if you have an outlet.Would recommend to the fullest blown status for the most comfortable bed.For high-raised or low one, it is also recommended that you use Bed Pad to make it more comfortable than without."
3,Aerobed,"We purchased this aerobed for company. We wanted it raised so that older relatives would find it easy to use. However we used it and gave the relatives our bed. It has floater sides on the bed, I guess to keep it more level.They really didn't do much but take up floor space. However my husband found getting in and out of the bed quite awkward. It was like a waterbed, especially if not inflated quite fully. When one person moves the other person goes for a ride. The second night we inflated it quite alot (we never heard the sound that aero bed says tells you it is inflated). The bed has deep seams on the top so to get comfortable you have to cushion yourself between the seams. Also there is a plastic smell. All in its okay; but I prefer our foam futon that folds up. Also being raised I think is a negative. Also it would probably slide around on wood or tile floors."
4,"Alright Airbed, Great Price","I bought this air bed in a pinch when I needed one. It was not my first choice but I am happy I bought it. It is comfortable for its size, and with two people sleeping on it you tend to slide towards the center.My only complaint and the reason for losing a star, is the bed does not seem to retain air as well as some other air beds I've owned. I would need to add air nightly.UPDATE:After having this bed a few months, this bed will no longer hold air through the night. After a full inflation, the bed will fold on top of you during the night creating a human taco affect."
4,nifty little idea book,"This is a small book, slightly wider than pocket-sized, with a single full-page photo for each kitchen and a writeup by a British magazine editor on the facing page. I found it refreshing as it presents views from across the pond, quite different from the sprawling natural wood kitchens typically shown in American magazines. Most of these kitchens are quite compact and do not have islands, and very few can take advantage of full picture windows or features such as exposed ceiling rafters. So if you're working with a large kitchen space (say from an addition), you might not have much use for this book. What these kitchens offer is creativity in the selection and coordination of color, texture, materials, and pattern, in many different styles (contemporary, Shaker, etc), all narrated expertly by Ms. Savill. It's a neat book for browsing, and you can get a miniature lesson on decoration on most any page."
5,Tae-Bo PT 24 7...amazing workout,I have done many other tae-bo workouts in the past and this is by far the best. I saw a definite difference in my body and the way my clothes fit with the first 7 days!!
4,Great Program,"I had recently cancelled my gym membership and have been trying to find something that I could do at home and stick to. So far, PT24/7 has been very motivating and challenging. The only complaint that I have is that the fit of the glove is not that great and I hope they eventually come out with other sizes to purchase separately."
2,not for beginners,"First was excited seeing this on ""The Doctors"" who made it sound like it was suited for anybody. This is not for beginners, and I'm not talking about strength or cardio fitness. It's very confusing watching, should be a mirror image like aerobic/yoga etc.. The yes sir etc... give me a break! It goes right into a fast routine, form be damned. To the idiot who thinks everyone should know all the punches, you sound just like my boss(everyone dislikes him). Is that you Wahid?"
1,where to get just the band,I love billy blanks workout program. I've been doing his workout for years and stay in the best shapes of my life but since my last resistance band broke and can't find another band like that to replace my old one. I'm not so sure if i am going to buy the PT 24/7 program. His website does not offered to sell just the band so does that mean that i will have to keep buying the whole workout program again each time the band broke?
3,PT 24/7 review,"Ok workout. Not as fun as the original Tae Bo tapes. The bands on the feet sometimes come off when doing some of the moves but all in all, a good work out. And the bands really do make a difference to the workout."
4,Great but beware of gloves,"When I got this item, everything was individually packaged. HOWEVER!! When I took out the gloves, there was a label saying: Due to California State Laws this product may contain chemicals that can cause cancer, infertility and reproductive damage. I immediately through it back in the box, along with the resistance bands (since I have my own that will work just the same way) and threw them away!! Why would they even make a product like that?! I kept the cds of course but a warning should have been included in the review/description of the product. I would have probably just purchased the workout cds instead. Overall, great product to workout too, love how it's 30 minutes for those busy bees, but throw out the gloves!! (most people said they were too huge anyway)."
3,"Oh, those foot straps","I found myself constantly readjusting those darn velcro straps, which kept coming off, rather than doing the workout itself. I originally lost about 50 lbs. with Billy's original VHS workout and I had great hopes for PT 24/7, but I feel he should have thought of a different strategy for these resistance bands and the velcro straps you have to attach to your shoes. Sorry, Billy."
3,Workout was great until the band broke,I love doing Taebo because I find it to be a great workout for my entire body. The PT 24/7 workout really makes you work hard. It upped my fitness and really strengthened my core.Unfortunately one of the bands broke and the workouts just aren't the same without them. You don't work nearly as hard without the bands.I am very disappointed because I can't find a replacement for the broken band.Billy Blanks: PT 24/7
3,Equiptment malfunction,I openened the package and proceed to workout with the dvd.....then bam!!!The silver hook the was held by the gloves detatched causing the resistant band and the hook to hit me in the leg. The workout dvd is good...but I would probably pay more and order it from walmart.com or the manufacturer because the company I ordered from only offered me an apologly. Saying we get it from the manufacturer you may need to call them.At least you could get an exchange or refund at walmart.
5,Billy Blanks PT 24/7,"This product has it all, It so different from all the other fitness dvds you will ever buy, it comes with everything you need for an all over body workout. Billy is so passionate about what he does, he is great to listen to, as he takes you through the workout explaining everything in detail. Great value."
4,Good Morning,"I wonder if the Billy Blanks CD box brings the bands indicating the box besides the pair of gloves. I am very interested in buying the full product, thanks"
2,Pt 24/7 don't waste your time.,"I would NOT recommend Billy Blanks PT 24/7. I did the whole program from start to finish for weeks on end and I did not lose a single pound!!!!! I was not over weight to begin with I only wanted to lose about ten ponds and tone up, it did not do this for me. I am very disappointed in this product. While Billy is very motivational, the product it's self also has many flaws. I am 5 foot even, the bands were too long and I could not put and real strain on the bands. Secondly the gloves that came with it were also entirely too big and slid off of my wrists. There is no way to adjust the bands or the gloves to your body's needs. There are also no instructions on how to properly connect the place the bands and the Velcro foot bands stuck to my carpet when I was trying to work out. The entire work out made me feel like I was a marionette. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Not what it seems to be...,"I am not particularly satisfied with this product for two reasons. First, this is Tae Bo and nothing more. The videos did not give me a great workout. I would do two workouts back to back to get a better work out. I was hoping for something much more strenuous. The videos were professionally done and I am satisfied with that, however I am basing my opinion on the workout itself. Second, the fitness bands provided were not great. The velcro footband does not stay fastened well. There should be a buckle there versus a thin velcro piece. I fixed this by using a fitness band, tying it in a loop to put around my foot and attaching the fitness bands to them.I think if you like Tae Bo you'll like this program. If you are looking for something more like P90X or Insanity don't waste your money. This is just my opinion."
2,BIG Disappointment!,"I was sooo excited to try this program out! I was under the impression that it would be just like any other Tae Bo workout, only with the addition of the bands to give you a resistance workout at the same time. WRONG! Some of the workouts don't include even a single kick! Sometimes the workouts focus only on the bands, performing movements like you would if you were using free weights. The worst part is that in all 7 workouts, I never got that uniquely Tae Bo glute burn (which is what I was most looking forward to). The only upsides are that the workouts are only 30 minutes, and let you know when you are 50%, 75% and 85% done. I wish I could have just bought the bands to do with my original Tea Bo videos and skipped the PT24/7 videos all together! As far as the seller goes, I recieved my product quickly and everything was in perfect condition."
5,Billy knows how to bring it !,"I am a month in on my exercise with this program and its kicking me into shape, I am totally enjoying the workouts, however, I am somewhat disappointed that the gloves are already starting to pull apart or at least the thin covering is already tearing. I am starting to feel tall and thin and everyone is asking what have I been doing lately - of course I am always quick to let them know it's Billy Blanks' PT 24/7 workout dvds. I will definitely be uploading my before and after pictures in a few months from now."
3,Annoyed Right Out of the Gate,"I just got PT 233/7 in the mail today and was very excited to try it.It arrived in a timely fashion and everything in the package was in good working order.I have only had time to do the first video. Unfortunately, the chatter of the blond inthe front row--and possible others, reciting: ""Yes, sir,"" repeatedly throughout the videoto be very annoying and just plain silly. Worse that that, it distracted me from hearing theinstructions. The ""Yes, sirs"" cheapened Blank's good instruction and enthusiasm.On the positive side, I believe I will benefit from the videos and Igot a good price of $49 on the internet. I really hope that the other videos are freefrom the obnoxious, ""Yes, sirs,"" so I can fully enjoy them. I am hoping that I can fall inlove with this program (as I have with Zumba) but the jury is still out on that."
2,Disappointment,"I decided to lose some weight with diet and exercise. I was watching a show called the Doctors and saw Billy Blanks demonstrating PT 24/7. I thought it wound be a good idea to start my excercise program with something fresh and new like PT 24/7. I ordered the product and was very disappointed with what I received. Amazon always does a great job shipping the product. The advertising is misleading. You only get the gloves, bands and DVD's. Not the foot straps that is needed to put the whole thing together. You can not use the bands with without the foot sraps. So basically, you can only watch the DVD's. And all the DVD's have exercises with the bands. What a rip off. Not only can I not use the gloves and bands. I can not order foot straps anywhere to complete the set. I just don't understand why someone would package and sell a product you can not use."
3,Arrived Dented,"I ordered a used wastebasket in ""new"" condition. It had a huge dent in it. If you really want this product, make sure you buy it new. I'm not sure it's worth the price they're asking, but you might as well get one that isn't beaten up. Another item I ordered brand new from this company also arrived damaged. The mesh on it was torn. The company was totally reasonable about replacing it, but of course that takes time. Buy in advance."
4,"Good, goofy fun","With a title like ""Death By Dressage,"" I had to read this book. It's not the best mystery I've ever read but the character is believably insane on the subject of horses and I do like the flippant narration. There's probably more horse lore than story in this one, but the horse lore is pretty much right-on and I really, really enjoyed the description of the clinic. The method of murder is ingenious, although I am a little confused about exactly when the narrator figured it all out -- it's pretty clear what happened quite a while before the narrator cries ""Eureka!""I like the ditzy, screwball heroine. I like her patient husband and her cranky mare, Plum. You can almost smell the horses, and the descriptions of their movement and bearing bring them right into focus.Maybe not the best horse novel ever written, but excellent reading when you're soaking in a bubble bath after a ride on a cold day!"
1,Disappointed,"I am a dressage rider and had heard good things about this book but was very disappointed. The plot was thin, the ending preposterous and the characters unbelievable. If you want a good equine mystery, read Dick Francis, Bill Shoemaker or Jody Jaffe. Or try John Francome or William Murray (not as good as the first three but better than Carolyn Banks)."
1,"I could not even finish this book, I did not even care!",I am an avid reader of Dick Francis and was looking for some new material. I hated this book. It was less than 200 pages and I could not even finish it. Did not care who killed whom half way through.
2,Average... for now...,"Not to discourage this band from doing what they are doing... however as a regular KC fan I must say that from my point of view it's a very average effort re-producing the old stuff and a very average effort creating new compositions. If you take all the new songs in a separate set you'll have no feeling of connection to KC. Anyway, maybe they just need a little more time to settle down (Giles, Giles and Fripp after all didn't start all that great either). Good luck."
3,No Region Free,"Be careful!!! dvd claims it is region free but will not play on brand new sony machine.Message reads:""cannot play because of region limitations"" and a friend of mine had the same problem with two copies of it."
5,Tomorrow's People Are Playing Now!,"The revered soul of the 69-72 Crimson King lives on!I was simply blown away by this concert. To hear and see these ground-breaking musicians play this music live after listening to the studio albums for 35 years brought tears to my eyes. The inclusion of the beautiful numbers from the McDonald & Giles album should delight long time fans.Michael Giles' under-appreciated one-of-a-kind drumming was a key ingredient of the original KC sound, and he shines here. WHAT A GREAT DRUMMER!!I also loved the twin flute and twin sax work of Ian McDonald and Mel Collins. Peter Giles on bass is very fine, and Jakko does a very nice job on vocals and guitar.Lastly, the keyboard work is great, with very convincing Mellotron patches."
3,Smells good but very small,"Beware the images! At $60 this was a lot smaller than I expected. True the volume was stated but the picture of the product had no scale, so I was expecting a bigger bottle!Amazon is still a great way to shop"
5,Buy the album and all her back catalogue NOW!,"This is a great album, albeit less jazzy than her previous 3 offerings in English ('A Night Like This', 'Good Times', 'The Stockholm Kaza Session' with her partner Per 'Texas'Johanson). The songs are strong musically and lyrically with more than a touch of humour. A lovely singer who deserves better recognition as an artiste and as a songwriter. Also look out for her first album in Swedish (Vad jag vill) AND her collaborative efforts in the band 'Gloria' ('Gloria' and 'People Like You and Me'). Check out 'www.gloriasays.com' for more information."
5,Forstner Set,Fair price and fast shipping. It's not the greatest set in the world but it has various sizes and for a basic home user its fine. If you are into a home shop you might want something better. If you are running a business defiantly go with higher quality.
5,Great set for the money,"I bought this set after it was recommended in one of my magazines as a top value tool. Honestly, I have not owned any forstner bits before, so I have nothing to compare them with. I am quite pleased with them so far. I've used several of the bits, including the largest in the set, a couple of the smallest, and a few in the middle. Most of the work I've done with them has been in hard maple or MDF. They all cut a very nice clean hole, don't burn, and push the removed material out of the way well.I did have the same issue that someone else mentioned where the cardboard outer sleeve was stuck to the wooden case.Overall, I recommend these, especially if you're like me and needed a decent set to get started."
4,Grizzly Forstner Bits,Bits are well made and are shipped in a attractive box. The bits perform well in both hard wood and soft wood. Good value for the money.
1,great disapointment,"For those who admire Van Tieghem's work with Laurie Anderson or have viewed his video dancing and playing with kitchenware, this CD is a great disapointment. Van Tiegem music is vulgar and uninteresting, sounding like a GRM jazzfusion production. Percussion is subdued in a pool of sounds, most of them, boring.Goncalo Falcao"
3,Scones are great....seller price is way too high,"Our family loves the Sticky Fingers English scones. I decided to stock up on Amazon. I ordered three differenct flavors which all shipped from different vendors. For approximately $12, I was able to get 3 packs of scone mix. I assumed that, given the price of nearly $12, I was getting a multipack from this vendor as well. When it arrived, it was just a single package which I could have purchased at my local Cost Plus for $5.95. Next time I'll read the quantity line more carefully.The scones themself are so quick to make and yummy. We've tried almost all the flavors and they are all delicious."
4,BAINE ROCKS!!!,"This movie is a roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Very intense and suspenseful. The acting is superb and can only be described as AWESOME! If you like suspense thrillers, this is one to watch."
2,A wonderful book for someone.,"I am sure some folks will find this book a real treasure, but it did not fit my purpose. I was looking for recipes that I could actually cook. I got a lot of history and puff...and some famous regional dishes that are just not practical for my day to day living.If I have not tossed it already, I will ""gift"" to someone as a throw down.Lodge (and I have a lot of the great Lodge Cast Iron cookware) may have supported this effort, but they did not get their money's worth."
5,Biggest Winner!,"This book was very inspiring, and was so easy to read and understand. It was written in nice chapters, with lots of before and after pictures to keep one interested. I love that the book explained things and had shaded boxes with additional information. I have read other fitness/diet books, and this by far was the easiest read of all. The diet is also very easy to follow, with recipes that seem quite simple and good. A very good purchase, and worth reading:)"
3,My Review,This little book is a practical and inspirational guide for those of us who want to lighten up.
4,The Biggest Loser Book,"If you like watching The Biggest Loser, you'll enjoy this book. I bought it primarily for motivation and my interest in the show. This book provides a good overview about getting started, an exercise plan, recipes and strategies from the cast members of the Biggest Losers. I also like the 12-week personalized program designed by the show's trainers."
3,biggest loser dvd,"i love the biggest loser bought the book and dvd last year... but the dvd been american dosent work in english dvd,s which is a real shame. Besides being a waste off money .Also some off the food in the recipies is different to ours which is a bit confusing."
3,I hate to rain on anyone's parade but . . .,". . . statistically speaking, 95 percent of these folks will gain their weight back within a year, and probably put on even more. That's just a fact.I love the show, but what we really need is a book on how to keep the weight off. Taking it off is possible, as so many of us know, but keeping it off is nearly impossible, based on hard data.How do you keep weight off? Taking it off and putting it back on, as these folks surely will, is very hard on the body."
5,HELPFUL,I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT WAS NICE TO READ ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH FOOD AS I DO. IT SHOWED ME THAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER YOU SET YOUR MIND TOO.
2,Don't bother,"I was so excited to get this book only to find that it is nothing but fluff. Bob Harper did not actually write the book, he only wrote the forward.As for the diet plan, there really isn't one. It's really just a series of anecdotes from the contestants. If that's what your interested in then then I suppose it's worth the read, but if you are looking for a book about weight loss don't bother."
4,Simple and Easy to follow plan,Like any weight loss program it takes hard work. This book is simple and easy to follow. Good luck everyone.
3,Disappointing,"I really wanted to love this book... but it seems as if the producers rushed it to print. There are very little before/after photos... and very little in-depth profiles of the contestants. All you get is blurbs from them... and a recipe, which may/may not be their creation. The caloric recommendations... 1050 kcal for people below 150 pounds... are too low...especially for the amount of exercise prescribed. Rarely these days do any experts advise going below 1400 kcal for an active woman, with 1200 be the absolute minimum. Even with such minimal caloric requirements, no mention is made of vitamin supplementation. In the recipe section, they often refer to agave nectar/syrup... yet they do nothing to explain it, its benefits, or where to buy it. (It's a low-GI sweetener from a plant in Mexico.) All-in-all, disappointing."
3,interesting and fun,"I actually read this book and Jillian Michaels book Winning By Losing. I think this book is interesting and fun because it does give you insights into the contestants and their trials and tribulations. I do agree that as far as nutrition plans go The Biggest Loser book is slightly lacking. If you are looking for a weight loss plan, Jillian's book is definately the best choice. Although the Biggest Loser book is not the most informative, as a fan of the show I enjoyed the read."
3,Still Need a Cookbook,While this wasn't a terrible book for the price the recipes and meals aren't very helpful. BBQ Lentils? Fish Tacos? Curry Vegetable Stew? A couple weeks of that and you will look for an excuse to cheat. I would of liked to see food done in a fashion that is easier to relate to.
5,You've gotta have it !!!,"I just love everything about ""The Biggest Loser"". The book is the icing on the cake. No fads, no quick fixes, not skinny minny people telling you that you can do it! Real life people whom you can relate to who took the challenge and changed their lives. Bob and Jillian put the simple tools together. We all know what it takes ... but to see it simply in words and easy rules to follow. The foods listed in the book are real. You get a wide variety and not have to suffer. Lots of great quotes and advice from the contestants too. Must Have!!!!!"
3,not the best weight loss tool,If this is you first weight loss attempt this book may work for you. If you have been down this road as many times as I have this probably isn't the best plan for you. The exercise plan is great but the caloric intake goes under guidelines. You could follow the exercise plan but I would strongly look into weight watchers as your food plan..more food and more flexibility as well as proven results. Good luck on your weight loss journey.......
2,Rip Off,This book isn't what it claims to be. It is a play by play of the show and there is no real weight loss advice except for random tips from the trainers.
4,As good as the TV show,"""The Biggest Loser"" diet suggests limiting your daily calorie intake to seven times your body weight (measured in pounds). For a 200 pound person that means 1400 calories a day. This might be OK for an average weight but I am not sure if the formula is proper for very heavy or very light people. So, from that point of view I find this book not very scientific. On the other hand the exercise plan suggested in the book is pretty reasonable. There are also a lot of other good advice that will help you take a long term control of you weight and will result in a good health: stay away from sugar (except for natural sugars contained in fruits), eat salad before each meal, exercise, and so on. For much more comprehensive advice on adopting healthy lifestyle, resulting in permanent weight loss I rather recommend Can We Live 150? by M. Tombak. A lot of free excerpts from Tombak's book can be found at the author's website."
2,Not what it claims to be!,"I bought this book looking for information on how to lose weight and also because I am a Bob Harper fan. Sadly this book is full of half hearted anecdotes with no real weight loss information at all and sports a meager 2 page forward by Bob. That's the total extent of his involvment in this book! Alas, I will continue to wait for Bob's book to come out, but meantime I recommend Jillian Michaels book Winning By Losing, it is the real deal."
3,It was okay....,"I did not find a whole lot of information I did not already know, but it was fun going back to see some of the first contestants. I missed all but the last few epidsodes of the first season. Plus, I LOVE BOB! so anything from him is enjoyable to read."
3,Too many pages for the quantity of useful information,"Although the actual diet and exercise program part of the book was very useful, I thought that there was not enough useful information in the other parts of the book. Everything could have been summarized in 2 chapters and could have been priced far less expensively."
2,it was okay,"it would of been nice if there where more exercise programs and menu or receipes, then just reading about the people who competed. that was nice but a little bit goes a long way.thanks"
2,Loser of a book.,"I expected the plan as it was given to the contestants on the Biggest Loser. I wanted a menu planner and a workout plan.This book was not much more then a recap of the TV show.I already saw that, I did not need to read about it."
2,A fluff piece,"I got this book hoping it would reveal ""the weight loss program to transform your life etc."" I found the book to be pretty light on the program part. There are a lot of tips from the contestants and from the trainers, but no real solid weight loss program and no logic or reasoning behind the tips that are given. Overall, I would only recommend this book is you are a fan of the show looking for contestant anecdotes. If you are serious about weight loss this book is not for you."
4,Good book,This was a purchase I was very surpised from. It was better then expected from all the ratings. It was excellent.
1,Too small for plate,"These holders are too small for Texas plates. Also, the metal is very thin, it bends very easily."
2,BE AWARE - this item is not really a frame!,"I had read other reviews noting that some plates were too large for this frame or rim. I figured that would not be a problem since I thought I would just trim the license plates to fit, which I did with no problem. The problem is that this item is not a frame at all. To me, a frame would go AROUND the license plate edges, like a picture frame goes around the glass and whatever is being framed. However, this so-called ""frame"" has the inside and outside edges that are the same depth. It is really just a 5/16 inch black bead that sits on the front of the license plate - leaving the edges of the plate exposed. It is well-made and well-finished, and would look very nice if it really was a frame and covered the license plate edges.I ordered two and didn't try to return them since the shipping cost to return would have been almost as much as the cost of the 2 frames."
1,Useless.....,"What good is it when it's smaller than a license plate? This is true for California plates, isn't the size standard. Also Amazon doesn't state for all the license plates whether one or two come in an order. I had assumed two since two are required. I received one, so be advised. I've returned it. Atleast Amazon makes that simple."
3,"Works as intended, but *might* be too small for your plate","Item is of decent construction quality (stamped, pressed steel or tin type sheet metal). I don't feel like the painted surface will chip away (it's on the back of my car so, it won't be receiving any rock/sand damage). The only issue I have is that my plates (AZ) just barely stick out the sides of the frame. It's not noticeable *much* looking at it directly, but from the side, I notice it. The sides of the plate are silver, and the car it is on is red. I could mask and spray the edges of the plate a satin black, but I'm sure it's illegal to do so.So, FYI, it's not bigger than a *supposedly* standard sized plate and does not fully cover mine."
4,Great item for your car,"These licence plate frames are great for any car owner wanting a simple solution for unsightly licence plate edges. The product made my car look a lot better. When I received the frames (I bought four - two for two cars) I was impressed by the quality. The metal they are made of is sturdy and the black coating seems very durable. I recommend this item to anyone into simple, modern and minimalistic style for their automobiles."
2,"Nice-looking frame but too small for Washington State, maybe others...?","These folks make a nice frame, but this did not fit -around- the whole plate, and the holes did not match up. Useless in WA state, not worth the $$ to return. Looks nice, too bad it won't work."
4,Best read in times like these...,"This book is great! Two years ago, I moved back to New York from the South and I was unemployed. I was able to have the best summer because of all the museums, parks and suggestions from this book. Just recently, I spent the day in Central Park riding the carousel and watching sea lions do tricks at the park's zoo. I would never have thought of trying that if it were not for this book. It's a bit dated (1991) with mentions of the former World Trade Center but many of the suggestions are relevant. I wish the author would write another with new things to do in New York. There's no need to cut back on entertainment to save money ...just pick up this book and you can go out for free and cheap fun!"
5,The government exposed,This book shows that nicotine is not addictive in spite of what government agencies and prominent scientists have been telling the public for years. I wonder whether other myths endorsed by the US government are able to withstand the intelligence of Frenk and Dar.Gonen.
5,"If you had any doubts about the brutality of the Taliban, this film you must see!","The Muslim Arabic world, especially the Taliban, were/are some of the most sadistic, disturbed people on this planet. I already knew this, but after seeing this film, I could not believe that humans are capable of this level of evil.Brilliantly done, artistically wonderful, amazingly acted, this film is an absolute must-see!THIS IS *WHY* WE FOUGHT IN AFGHANISTAN!!!"
3,Messy marriage between Documentary and a Movie..,I had lot of expectations before the movie..Honestly the movie is just boring. I think the people who gave the award were carried away by political considerations of the success of War in Afghanistan. A good documentary could have brought most of the highlights of the movie(below) better than a week storyline that is offset by Powerful casts>Islamic way of washing urself after a wet dream>Talibanizing Kids>Brute legal system( profanity..stone the lady to death...)>Buying and selling womenThe directors could have gone to remote villages of Saudi Arabia and able to complete this movie much more elegantly
2,Osama,The video is rather slow and will be difficult to capture the attention of a Grade 12 audience due to the subtitles. A translated version would have been much better I feel but I will try it this semester with my students and see how it goes.
3,Stunning and Depressing,Brilliant movie with a depressing ending. Don't buy it if sad movies make you depressed.
2,This movie really didn't move me...,"To be quite honest I was never drawn into this movie emotionally. The story is poorly put together and the acting isn't very good. The movie shows the Taliban's cruelty, but it is emotioanlly empty. We never got to know her as a girl. We never got to know anyone on a personal level.The equality talk by the grandmother at the beginning of the movie was very forced. The whole reporter execution seemed kind of corny. I still don't understand the what the jump rope had to do with anything. The whole ""Pass under the rainbow, and boys become girls, and girls become boys"" was rather hollow. The story is too rushed together: She disguises herself as a boy, goes to work, goes to school, gets arrested, get enslaved into a marriage, in less than an hour and a half. Give me a break.How the heck did this win a Golden Globe? I have to say that this movie is mediocre at best...A documentary about the Taliban would be much more informative and engaging than Osama..."
5,A Modern Day Horror Show,"As revealed in this movie, life under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan was a horrorifying experience. The people were treated with unbelievable cruelty by the authorities who were more interested in enforcing an ultra-puritanical version of Islamic law than they were in providing basic services or in rebuilding the country from years of war that began with the Soviet invasion in 1979. If you want to see just how rotten government can get, then this is a must see movie."
2,not recommended,I didn't like this movie. Too depressing. The news is full of it why watch another movie to hear bad news?
4,afghan women,"A grandmother, a mother, and a daughter live alone--that is to say, with no man in the house--in Taliban Afghanistan. See this film in conjunction with Khandahar"
4,Regretfully accurate,This film regretfully depicts what I have witnessed in both Afghanistan & Pakistan in the last few years. The film also captures the sense of hopelessness people and especially women have in these countries. Islam in contrast to other religions is not a religion of hope but of doom.
4,Great performance upgrade,"In my opinion, money well spent. Increases air flow for noticeable difference in pickup. Doesn't increase engine noise as might have been expected. You need some type of air filter after all, and I totally recommend this one."
1,More of a dictionary than anything else,"Here's a dictionary, teach yourself the English language. This book was written with that mentality in mind. Possibly a good resource book, but by far a good teaching manual, despite the title."
4,Good but not perfect,"An overall excellent production of Threepenny with the inimitable Max Raabe as Mackie Messer. The other performers also good. Nina Hagen was a bit difficult to take, but I do get her approach and it was brave.Weill and Brecht should be proud that artists still mine this 80 year old work for inspiration; and like all great works, there is no definitive version."
1,Pathetic,"Really disappointed over all in the NationalGeographic toys. This one also failed miserably in performance. This was purchased for a 6 year old for Christmas. As another review stated you can't keep it in alignment or focus even as an adult. The 6 year old was NEVER able to focus in even on a big bright star.He got very frustrated from trying and even started to cry. You can see more with our pair of binoculars. Save your money and go for a higher power and better frame, ect."
1,Disappointment,"We have tried to use this telescope many times. The lack of a view finder makes it really difficult. It also is hard to get the lenses to stay in the right alignment or get the right focal length. It works fine for daytime outdoor viewing of distant trees, but it is really disappointing and frustrating at night."
3,"More, please","This would have been better with the inclusion of some of his other 'soundies'. But some of his best are here, and there was then and never will be anyone like him. One objection: the images are quite murky at times; I'd like to see his work re-mastered from original sources."
3,A Book written By Rachel Carson,I thought this book was very mature and detailed. She is an excellent writer and I am doing a report on her! She was a wonderful person. And I enjoyed this very much.
4,Hitachi 4-inch dry cut,"I bought this specifically to build a concrete paver patio that had a completely curved perimeter. Didn't want to rent a wet-saw since I didn't know how long it would take and didn't want to buy one because I lack storage space. The paver blocks were 2 3/8"" thick and the saw cut depth is only about 25mm (about 0.9 inches). I found the cleanest thing for me was to cut one side, flip the paver, cut the other and use a thin chisel to make the split. I developed a system and it took some time to get good at it. Lots of dust, I highly recommend a respirator and good safety glasses as chips do fly around. I bought a second blade but never needed it. For my homeowner project it sufficed and was a good value. It's a comfortable size and weight and good quality - I already have multiple other small projects lined up for it."
3,Honestly is ok....,"This product is good, good for small materials. Like for regular patio bricks this product only cuts half way into the middle and you would have to hammer it with a plastic hammer. Also becareful cutting a little bend will damage the blade."
3,Hitachi CM4SB2,"Got this as a clearance item for $25 - saw only without the diamond blade, no manual, no box, no tools or anything else. My 4"" right angle grinder diamond blades fit.Built like a tank, powerful little saw but no other adjustments other than depth of cut. I have no problems with the limitations as I have 7"" diamond blade on a worm drive circular saw, 10"" stationary wet saw and a 14"" portable gas saw."
2,Excellent quality but should come with case.,"Just received this saw today. Used it to cut out some 1/4 inch grout lines. Cut with ease. This little saw is heavy and well made. It is easy to use and powerful. I give it 4 stars because there is no case. Otherwise it would be five. stars.Update 2-9-2010: Change from 4 stars to 2 stars.1. No case2. 7/8 arbor. All of my existing blades are 5/8"" arbor.3. No tilt adjustments.4. Ryobi makes a better one for a much lower price.Probably not the best saw for the price. However, this is still a well made saw and very powerful. Hitachi makes excellent tools overall and I will continue to buy Hitachi."
5,Good,"The vinyl does not looks like on the web, it's different, and that's not cool because that version has the remix I looking for, anyway this EP just like item it's in perfect conditions."
4,A Fun Adventure,"This is the story of Max, a boy with a vivid imagination, who is troubled at home due to the lack of proper attention given to him. One night after biting his mom during a tantrum, Max runs away and hides. This is where his imagination takes over and he sets out to sea. His journey takes him to a wooded area where Max stubles across some monsters who are having some internal problems of their own. At first the monsters, led by Carol, threaten to eat Max, but are persuaded not to after Max tells them he has powers that can make their heads explode. The monsters adopt Max as their King and from there the adventure continues on.I would continue to tell the rest, however I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the movie. I can't see how people have found this to be boring though and though it is a bit sad towards the end, it's still entertaining almost throughout. I recommend it for all families. Kids should be at least 7 though."
4,"Good movie, my kids actually loved it, not much of a story line, but it works.","First of all, I must say I love the book, as a boy I read it quite often, but there isn't really much of a story line in the book either. This movie attempts to add one. I don't understand how all these reviewers are saying ""It's not for kids"" I beg to differ, my kids LOVE this movie. It's more about a kid hanging out with monsters who have issues about their place in the world, at least one of them. This is a struggle we all have had to face, and still are. Being adults, we must remember to never forget our children, and to help them along, to find their place in the world. There's a lot of nonsense really, but enjoyable nonsense. It is a fun movie, and it makes me realize that sometimes when we see our kids acting nonsensical, we need to stop taking things so seriously, and join in on the fun, because sometimes we need a little nonsense in our lives."
2,Kids like book - Hate movie,"My 9 year old son said younger children should not watch this as it is too scary and would ""teach them to bite their parents"". He and his 11 year old sister did not make it all the way to the end of the movie as they found it ""weird"" ""depressing"" ""scary"" and ""no fun"". Having heard negative reviews, I still expected them to enjoy it due to their love of the book when they were preschoolers. I now realize that it doesn't necessarily translate to a good movie. I believe it failed because a children's movie ultimately should be fun or funny with a good message thrown in if possible. This had neither. They were dismayed by the relationship between mother and child, feeling the mother was afraid of the child. There was no good reason to have your children watch this."
2,Wild Things DVD,I thought it was rather boring and drawn out. The point being made to children to have self-control would have to be processed by the parents to make it a teachable moment.
1,Worst soundtrack ever.,"Picture every single indie rock cliche that ever existed, and put them in a blender, and voila! Karen O and the kids. VOMIT."
3,Not A Kid's Movie!,"It was an okay movie...but don't buy it if you are looking for a good children's movie, because this is NOT a children's movie."
5,"Rowdy, funny, moving and full of soul","Simply put, I love this movie. I read the book as a child but it wasnt a favorite and I really didnt remember much about it, so I didnt see the movie with any preconceptions. There have already been reams of reviews and opinions about this movie posted online, so I wont go into plotlines or underlying themes. I will just say that I cant think of anything about this film that I dont like, from the scrawled-over opening credits to the amazing dialogue-less closing scene. I will say that nothing about this movie would have clicked if not for Max Records as Max (how cool is that?). He comes off as a real kid, something a lot of young actors simply cant pull off. He is able to tell you everything you need to know about his character without uttering a word and that is something a lot of actors of any age cant pull off. This film is a gem."
2,Disappointed!!!,Thought it would be so dark. Took too long to develop & my 4 yr old lost interest quick. I had to struggle to finish watching it!!
4,Where The Wild Things Are,"Although not a favorite of mine, my daughter, now 39, loved this story and my 6 yr. old grand-daughter loves it now, so I purchased it. The grand-daughter and her friends have watched it more than a few times. It does play into their active imaginations."
5,spike jonze where the wild things are.,"I went to see this movie with my 7 years old son and my husband we all loved it.It touched me very deeply. I found myself crying more then one time , especially during the mom and child scene.Spike Jonze was the perfect director to get a movie out of Sendak's book."
3,Really not as good as I'd expected,"Visionary, this is beautiful. The monsters are real-looking and the scenery is lovely. The story is very similar to the book, which I was never into, but it is an accurate transition from book to film. It follows a rowdy little boy who is wild and bites as he runs away and stumbles onto the Wild Things. He becomes their king and leads them in the ways of the wild. The story is very loose, no real plot, other than the lesson the boy learns that you cannot get by on being wild. My 10 year old enjoyed it but not so much my 4 year old, she thought the Monsters were too scary and won't watch it again. If you liked the book, you'll love the movie. But if you also aren't a fan of the story you will also be disappointed."
1,Waste Of Time,"Simply put, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Max is a bipolar brat of a kid with no redeeming qualities who scares his mother and brings those same qualities to the magical beasts he encounters on his journey. Then he comes home and Mom gives him milk and cookies! Yikes!My 9 year old loved it, my 11 year old said it made no sense and the wife and I want our two hours back. I'm so glad we rented this from the local library for 50 cents and even that was too much. Don't waste your time or $."
1,Disappointing Wild Things,"Purchased this to share with my grandchildren; all but the two eldest, 14 and 18, went to bed. I think they stayed up so Grandma would not be alone.From the very beginning; it was bad. I had looked forward to it as I had read the book over and over to my children (they all went to bed, too) Never should have purchsed it; just held on to the good memories of reading and enjoying. Now, I have to get the bad movie memory out of my head!!!"
1,I want my 2 hours back,"I was very disappointed by the movie. They could have made something great with the subject matter, however what we got was this product. Something that was too adult for kids and too childish for adults. I can not say anything that has not already been said in these reviews ad nauseam, other than the positive reviewers seem to be trying to hard to convince themselves that it was something more than it was."
1,Boring,"All I can say about this movie is that it was BORING...and a little weird. I never read the book so I don't know how close to that it came. But if the book was that boring I don't know how it ever got made into a movie.And if I had little kids I would definitely NOT let them watch this. With hideous creatures, the kid getting swallowed by one, violence like birds getting knocked out of the air with stones and a creature's arm getting pulled off, I would say this would cause a young child to have many nightmares. Do not let young children watch this.Boring and disturbing at the same time. I am not usually harsh in my reviews but there's absolutely nothing positive I can say about this movie."
1,A Great Case Study for a Child Psych Class,"This movie should be required as a case study for abnormal child psychology courses. It offers a great overview of a disturbed and unbalanced child. It was surprisely a terrible movie the worst I've ever seen, even worse than Lilo and Stitch. I'm glad it was a rental."
1,Really Terrible....,"Terrible acting, a bunch of selfish people, unconvincing, often disturbing in parts. The message could have been presented in a far, far, far more artful and tasteful way without being Polyanna-ish. We home school our children and watch few movies anyway - glad we previewed it before we let them watch it. It went right in the garbage!"
1,Could not play this movie.,"I am a Kindergarten teacher and purchased this movie for the kids to view. Afte purchasing the movie , it would not play and my students were disappointed."
2,Where the wild things are,I would not suggest this movie for any age children. It is very violent and teaches children bad lessons about behavior and consequences for actions. The boy in the story is destructive and the wild things at one point tear each others limbs off. Not a good choice and very differernt from the book.
2,Where the Wild Things Are - Scary!,"Our almost three year old was scared in parts of the movie. The book is his favorite, so we thought he would like the movie - as he LOVES videos. However, we stopped the movie just a little while in, and haven't shown it to him since."
3,Wild Things,"Where the wild Things Are is sort of depressing. Most of the film has a gloomy atmosphere. It's not really for kids, thats for sure. I read the book long ago but I recall it being more up-lifting than the movie. It's about Max who runs away from home and goes to an island by boat and becomes the king of the Wild Things. The Wild Things are interesting looking and all seem to have problems, such as anger issues, being ignored, or feeling lonely. I guess they all share some traits of Max. Kind of like the movie ""9"" where the scientist split his soul/emotions/ personality or whatever into the 9 different sack poeple. In the end,this movie doesn't make you feel all happy and warm. I was glad when it was over."
2,Where The Bad Movies Are (One & a half stars),Length:: 7:01 MinsMy review of Where The Wild Things Are on Blu-Ray
1,Somethings should be left as a book,"We rented it first and I'm so glad we did. It was horrible! The movie takes a 20 minute story and stretches it for 90 or so minutes. In the end, you walk away wishing you could get a refund. My advice, rent before you purchase if you just must see."
1,This was a kids movie?,"Lets set aside that this was a bad movie to begin with as well as a horribly written script adaptation from a cool book. This was not made for kids. Any kid who was not asking a dozen questions afterwords needs some psychiatric help. I sat in the theater and wondered how I was going to explain this when it was over. It's easier with other movies where I can just make it clear that the things aren't real and that there aren't going to be any monsters coming out of the woods to eat you like in Spiderwick. I had to explain emotions and sensitivity with this one. I'm kind of big on not making movies out of books, and this is an awesome reason why."
4,Not a Kid's Movie ... and a great movie!!!,"What a dark movie!!! I remember the kids book and once I understood how dark the movie is, I use it with clients when discussing and working with the darker side of your humanity.It is a GREAT story ... a young man explores his anger in a far away land where the situations unfold in looking at how interaction occurs between ""people"" ... looking at dreams, 'reality' and life in between ...Still enjoy this movie!!!"
1,GET ME THE H-E Double hockey sticks OUT OF HERE!,"I would rather sit through a painful root canal than to sit through the agonizing boredom I experienced watching this film. Even the children next to me at the theater were bored to tears, and one was even playing on his Nintendo (I don't blame him in the least). I really tried to give this film a chance (and the snooty discerning indie side of me wanted to love it), but after 30 minutes, I wanted to shove my head in my tub of popcorn and suffocate my self to death."
1,Horrible movie,"I do not watch movies that often, and this one reminded me why. This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. That kid is a huge unsympathetic brat that just needed some good strong discipline and maybe some Ritalin. I watched it with two other adults and two 10-year olds, and not one us understood it, or enjoyed it any way. I laughed once the entire movie, the rest of the time spent wondering what was going on, and what kind of mommy and daddy issues the director and producer had. This is nothing like the book with the exception that the monsters (physically) appear to be faithfully rendered."
1,creepy ass movie,My husband rented this movie for our children to watch tonight. I am SO glad we didn't take them to the movie theatre to see it. It is the creepiest thing I have ever seen. I think the director of the movie was having some kind of bad acid trip when he filmed it.....where the hell do people get their creative license these days.
1,?????,This movie was a big disappointment. I think it is just to far out there.It lost my familys intrest in just a few minutes and I was left dozing in and out to the end.
1,Horrible,"It is plain horrible. No plot, bad casting, spoiled brat as main character. I felt like watching a bunch of depressed drug adgicts fooling around in monster costums."
2,Snorefest,"This was not a book I grew up with, or even knew about until the film was released (was not popular where i lived), and it sounded very intriguing. So got the book, and was very surprised at how short it was ! Now the film sounded even more worth watching.Good credit for the young actors to pull off a believeable performance using this very long, drawn-out script. The imagination spark in the story was lost to an overly bloated wild thing community who were given no character.This film is extremely boring and tedious. Unless you're a film critic student, give this a miss.Avoided 1* as the animation and acting was good."
1,Worst movie ever,"Worst movie ever... dark, creepy, disturbing... such a strange film that I had to write a review to let everyone know how bad this film is!"
5,Beautiful and Misunderstood,"This film touched my heart and instantly became a favorite. I don't understand how so many people disliked it. I think it goes much deeper than most want to look. I see this boy struggling with his monsters, finding their place within himself and emerging better for his journey. With so many children these days confused by the world, struggling, being ignored, medicated, placated, how are they to deal with the Wild Things that rage and rumpus within them and within us all? Look deeper, pay attention. This film is brilliant in my eyes."
2,Pass.,The words of this book would barely fit on a few pages. As a result the movie just didn't work too well. I get the anger issues between the boy and his favorite monster but other than that this really wasn't terribly interesting. MY GRADE: C minus to C.
1,The worst movie of all time.,"I hated this movie. 1st off you cant expect to take a short children's story and make it into a full feature film and still have the same charm and magical effect as the book. They took A LOT of artistic liberties and ended up making a children's book in to a hipster art school college type of movie. I felt the movie was a way too dark for it to be considered a children's movie. The ""wild things"" were constantly threatening (in a sinister way) to eat the little boy ""Max"" and then a character's arms are torn off. You would think because they had all this extra time to fill stuff in the movie they would have done a better job writing a story that went some where. No problems where resolved! The kid was a cry baby brat in the beginning and a brat in the end as well. I probably hated the sound track most of all. That ""All is Love"" song makes my ears bleed its so awful. To summarize the worst movie EVER it ruined the book for me."
1,Can I give it Minus Stars,Thought the movie would be a fun one to watch with kids. It could have been and still made the points I'm guessing they wanted to make. One of the worst movies I have ever watched and I made myself watch all of it just to see if it would get better. NEVER did! It will find the trash can!
3,"Love the Book, Love Spike, but the movie was just OK","Growing up, this was my favorite book. Spike Jones has made two of my favorite movies of all time, but I'm afraid to say this missed more than it hit. I only give it three stars because it had a few magical moments. I was very disappointed."
5,Where The Ugly Kid Lives,"I really liked this movie, it made me feel like a kid again, but come on, the boy who plays Max is so ugly. When his Sisters friends smashed his igloo and he cried, he looked like a 90 year old giving birth. When I saw him cry and manage to look like Meg Ryan, I almost gave up. He looked like an extra from The Real Housewives series. I would have slapped him and said "" Snap out of it"". Other than hating the casting of Max, I loved this movie and had an absolute blast! Other than watching the kid now known as Cha Cha lips."
2,Not an interesting twist,"Clearly, Spike Jones had to add a lot to the tale to make this simple book into a movie, but the story felt bloated and uninteresting."
1,Arrgh... my kids hated it.,"I was hoping for a half hour or so to get stuff done, but the kids didn't last 10 minutes with this DVD. My 7 year old reviewed it, ""It is stupid."" Not good. Drat."
1,Dissapointing,"I purchased this movie thinking it would be a wonderful watching experience. I was very very disappointed. The movie was jerky, and the story was more than confusing, and the ending rediculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
1,surprised,I've read this book to my daughter and my grandchildren and we loved it. I was so surprised how bad the movie is. The violence and anger they portrayed for the boy was too much. I'm sorry I ever bought this movie and I certainly will not share it with the children.
3,Pretty Good!!!,"This movie wasn't really what I was expecting. Some parts were sort of boring, and I felt like the plot wasn't going anywhere. The special effects were cool, and Max Records did an awesome job. It has been years since I've read the book, but I felt that I didn't need to. Some things were different than in the book. Max is a young kid with a lot of energy and enjoys fantasy. When his mom or sister won't play with him, he throws a fit and runs away. He comes to an island run by the 'wild things' Max tries to act like them and they make him their king. They build a huge fort, but when K.W. brings her friends to the fort, Carol doesn't like them, so he becomes mad at Max and tries to eat him. Will Max ever get back home? I'd probably recommend WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE!!!"
2,Is this really a children's film?,"The puppetry is stunning, the effects are amazing, the child actor is really great... but the movie is depressing! I watched the movie just to be sure it is appropriate for my neice and found the story uncaptivating, boring and sad. I made the mistake of purchasing the dvd and will sell it ASAP. Spike Jonze is a very talanted director, but this isn't one of his best."
1,Not a movie for kids...,"I was so disappointed in this movie. It is totally inappropriate for any child under the age of 13, which is certainly ridiculous considering the book content appealing to all ages. The animated costumes were incredibly realistic, but that is not why I bought the movie. I wanted a story with a good message, but you won't find it in this movie. It was so painful to watch that I only made it half way through."
2,Depressing,"While I can appreciate the artistic value of a film like this (some of the shots were quite imaginitive and beautiful), I still left the cinema quite disappointed with the overall quality of the writing and feeling somewhat depressed over the content. I saw the film not too long after the Black Saturday bush fire tragedy in Victoria, Australia (where I live and where this movie was filmed) and I was quite alarmed to discover that the film maker had made the most of the tragedy and used some of the burnt out bush as a set for a scene or two. Ordinarily this wouldn't have bothered me as bush fires here are an annual event, but Black Saturday was much more than a normal bush fire and I found the inclusion of it's aftermath in the film incredibly insensitive and difficult to watch. To say it touched a raw nerve would be an understatement."
1,Don't waste your money,"Without a doubt, the most boring movie ever made. We bought this for our grandchildren to watch - - within 40 minutes, the DVD and packaging material was in our recycle bin. The visual effects are incredible, but not enough to sustain this story - the ""monsters"" are for the most part sympathetic characters, but after a fairly interesting start showing an emotionally troubled young boy in serious conflict with his mother and sister, he finds -imagines-daydreams- himself on an island populated with monsters who are a pretty tame bunch. At that point, the movie shifts into low gear and drags on from there. I wouldn't waste the money to even rent this disappointing movie."
1,Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen.,"I can not believe that the first two reviews on Amazon came up as 5 star for the movie. Check the numbers and you will see that far more people rate it a 1 star than a 5. So much has been covered in the other 1 star reviews that I won't repeat it. I'll just summarize and say that turning a short childrens classic in to a long drudgery that explores dysfunctional families and personality disorders should have been stopped somewhere along the line. If you want to be bored and depressed, rent the Piano - at least is it was honest."
1,Big Disappointment,"My seven year-old son and I checked this movie out at the library. We were very excited to watch it together. Half-way through the film my son announces, ""Mommy this is the worse movie ever...I'd rather watch the Ram's play football (his least favorite team in the NFL) than to continue watching this."" Then the most amazing thing happened...something I'd never experienced before...something that prompted me to immediately write this review...my son, wide-awake, stood up...and volunteered to go to bed!Look this movie is 1 star at best. Nevertheless don't count it out so quickly. Sleep aid or discipline...kids bouncing off the walls, pop in this movie...kids getting a little out of hand, pop in this movie! Bad movie...great aid!"
1,TERRIBLE,"I honestly don't know what people see in this film that makes them like it. I mean, I get that everyone has different tastes yada yada yada, but this movie was so BORING. It had a terribly slow pace. I also have never disliked a lead actor as much as I did with this movie. He was unbearable. I cared nothing for his character and thus found myself completely not caring about the outcome of the movie. And honestly, what is the message of the movie? That an inconsiderate, undisciplined child can torture his mother to the point of ruining her life, go to a magical land, learn nothing, then come back and everything is okay?? Seriously??Two thumbs down."
1,"Boring, implausible, and pointless","I guess that the filmmakers want us to think that this is a deep exploration of a young kid who's misunderstood and dealing with some sort of emotional issues, but the reality is that it's a story of a spoiled kid who dreams about some of the most boring creatures imaginable. There's nothing to latch onto here--no sympathy for any of the characters (except the poor mom, but we don't see enough of her), no plot that we can watch develop, no character development that we can relate to. And how could they possibly think that an ending with no words between the kid and his mom is going to be effective? This kid hasn't learned a thing. It's simply a boring, plotless two hours of drivel--easily one of the worst films that I've ever seen. Save yourself the time and energy, and read the book--it'll take five minutes and will be much more satisfying."
2,Disturbing and Humorless,"Normally I really like this kind of thing but I just found I had no empathy for anybody (or thing) in this film which made it hard to enjoy. The humor (what of it there was) I found either disturbing or just not funny, it may have worked if this had been made an animated feature, but in live action it's just not working for me, especially (spoiler alert!) where the one thing got it's arm torn off. Yikes! That was followed shortly by pretty much the only good line in the movie though...In short, I can't recommend this to anyone. Go read the kids book again. :)"
2,not what I expected,"I remember the book from when my son was a child. I ""thought"" I liked it. But, this film....well, I did NOT enjoy it. I suggest you rent or borrow from a friend if you want to see this, I would not buy this. Waste of money."
2,Sad movie,"I don't mind sad children's movies. I do, however, want some glimmer of hope or redemption at the end, which this movie did not offer. Max is an obviously troubled child who should be getting lots of attention and guidance at home, which he is not. One night after acting out and getting in trouble, he runs away to a desolate island of his mind and encounters several monsters, each representing various aspects of his own emotions. These monsters are constantly in conflict, just as the feelings within Max. He tries to be their king to bring some order to these unhappy monsters but without success. He finally abandons the miserable creatures to return home, which seems to indicate that he is unable to cope with his own inner turmoil and has given up. The sight of these pathetic monsters crying and watching Max leave left me feeling very sad and troubled."
3,Read the book,Should have stayed close to the book. Sometimes short and simple is better. Just okay.
1,One of the most BORING movies of all time,"OMG, sooooooo boring. And the main bear is bipolar. Not worth any of your time, buy something that is actually worth watching."
1,Terrible! Worst movie of the YEAR!,"This movie is one of the most boring movies I have ever had to sit through. I guess you should not expect too much given it was made from a book with <100 words, but I was bored stiff through the entire film. My kids like the book, but the movie kept them interested for <5 minutes. Don't bother."
1,the worse story ever written,"this film has to be the dumbest story ever written in history of films. I kid must of wrote this film. the photography, acting, and art is good and the film was well made, but the story is so bad that Im still amazed they made a movie off that story. its a film that will leave u saying 'what the hell was that all about'. this film was a waste of money to make. and I give it zero stars"
1,Turned Off After Ten Minutes,"Never liked the book; didn't like the movie. I knew I wouldn't like it when the first preview is an ad for the video game that will result - hmmm - for the same reason I didn't like the 3rd Pirates of the Caribbean movie.When we all sit down, as a family, to watch a movie, it should be fun and entertaining. We turned this one off after 10 minutes of watching this way-too-common scenario. The kid doesn't have a Dad around - we get it! What child wouldn't act like a monster? Proof that it is way too hard to make a ""good"" feature-length film from a 5 minute book."
5,A Mature Movie for those on the Journey of Life,"Yes indeed, this movie is a far cry from the book, but it is really the book for all those that have grown up in an imperfect world.I have not seen in any of the reviews yet the connection to the absolute therapy this movie can bring to so many that have tragic pains in their past. As mentioned in the review title ""This is a movie for those on the journey of life"" The movie is about making progress and not staying where you are in the situation of your pain. The movie is very similar to Robert Bly's ""Iron John"" Those familiar with the book and have loved it, will know what I mean. This movie is pure symbolism and metaphor for the journey of every wounded soul. I will forever love this movie..thank you Mr. Sendak, and thank you Spike Jonze."
3,Where The Wild Thing Are,I just couldn't get into this movie. It was a little over the top for me. To silly even for kids
2,Should've Been Better,"Nice art direction and costumes. Picture quality is good. But the movie is tepid, uninspired, and downright boring. Some childhood stories are better left in book form."
2,disapointment,bought this a couple weeks ago becasue I remembered the book as a kid. My wife did not like it either. atleast we only paid 4 dollars and shipped free with prime. I would be sad if I had paid full price.
2,Didn't live up to the hype.,"I was a little disappointed. The part where Max is with the ""Wild Things"" is kind of drawn out and pointless. Not to mention awkward. The beginning and the end are better but not by much. I don't think a child could gain anything from watching this movie in terms of an overall message, and it was too slowly paced to really entertain.Overall, I think adults who enjoyed the book as a child would enjoy this movie the most, and that isn't much."
1,Nietzschian Emptiness... I just flushed 101min of my life...,"My family and I loved the childrens book (we have many Maurice Sendak books in our library) and were so excited to see this movie. We had so much hope for it!We watched it with our kids and several nieces and nephews and it didn't take long before ALL of the young kids asked to leave and even the preteens said ""this is super boring and depressing"".I soldiered on hoping that there was treasure to be unearthed or revealed - something to reward those who slogged on through the muck to finish the film. Nope.At the end, I felt like Wesley in the Princess Bride after the 6 fingered man says ""I just sucked 5 years of your life away. How does it make you feel?""Everything about the film leaves one feeling empty. All of the characters are ultimately empty and life in that universe has no real meaning. Did Nietzsche or Spike Jonez direct this?"
2,How Much Bickering Can One Kid Stand?,"Where the Wild Things AreThe Wild Things are not so much wild as bickering stand-ins for selfish and unpredictable adults.Amazing facial expressions on the beasts' ""faces,"" but this is not really for younger children."
3,Not the same,"If you are a huge fan of the book(Like me) you will be disappointed in the movie. Even though it managed to involve all the monsters(except one) and managed to make them look like the book. It had the look of the book but was way off in story. This was not a kids movie. Very sad and dramatic. Deep characterization of the monsters and their relationships with each other. It was nothing like I expected. Finding it in the ""Drama"" section of my local video store kinda confused me until I watched it. It is a good movie for what it is,(which is why I gave it 3 stars) but it isn't what a fan of the book would expect at all! If you go into it expecting it to be it's own thing, you may enjoy it. If you are looking for a great re-creation of the book...... you'll be let down. Over all: Good movie - Bad rendition of the book. Don't be fooled, it is NOT a good movie for young children..... as it should be. (It is a book for little ones)"
5,We Loved It,"I brought a 15 year old boy, 10 year old boy, and seven year old girl to this movie. All four of us loved it. We laughed and cried. Some of the criticisms of the movie are the same type the book received when it was first published. If you are expecting ""Toy Story"" do not go see it. When I read these reviews I'm irritated by the comments about Max's behavior. In the book he was chasing his dog around with a fork and told his mother he would eat her...did you expect an angel? It would be impossible to make a full-length movie exactly like the book. I was not disappointed in any way. I think the movie was extremely creative. It was magical for me to see the old ""Wild Thing"" friends of my childhood come to life on the screen. They looked exactly as they should. It was a fantasy lived out. If you know anything about Maurice Sendak, he is no jolly Burl Ives type. This movie is, to me, a Sendak-style movie. It isn't perfect, but I would still recommend it with 5 stars. I will buy it on DVD."
2,"sad movie, not good for young kids","My 7 year old and I both found this movie made us quite sad, my 3 year old sat through it but did not like it. Teens might like it. Its not that its inappropriate for young kids, but just not very enjoyable for them at all."
5,Age factor.,"I am 71 years old and thoroughly enjoyed visiting with Maurice Sendac's loving creatures again, even without a child on my knee or by my side. I am not ashamed to admit I may be older, but I am not too grown up for these creatures."
3,Two Crying little wild things....................,"Watched this with my 4 1/2 year old boy and 6 year old girl. My kids love the book. Very deeply emotional. I had to console both of my kids and it took an hour for them to calm down. They were crying like the world had ended. Because of the deep nature of emotions of the film, I would not suggest it for anyone under 10 years old. Monsters were creative and fun, but there is an underlying sadness to the entire film that even a young child can feel. Certainly not a feel good film. Don't watch it before going to bed unless you are prepared to answer some unexpected questions."
2,It was bad,"Ok, I get the moral of the story. Horrible little boy learns about just how horrible he has been and goes home to eat cake. I just wish the main character, the boy, was at all likable. I hated him. He wasn't cute. He wasn't funny. He was obnoxious. From start to finish. You really have to turn your brain off while watching this movie. Or be under the influence of something. Some may think this is a deep, emotional, thought provoking movie but they're wrong. If you know someone with a horribly obnoxious child, ask yourself, would you want to watch a movie about them?I give it 2 stars because of the good special effects and decent but dull acting of the monsters. Also, when the mom threw her son on the floor after he bit her. I liked that part. I liked seeing him cry."
2,Too Gloomy,"The lack of happiness throughout got me down. Some parts were a little more joyful, but by the end I was left feeling sad. A sad movie wasn't really what I was looking for when I decided to watch Where the Wild Things Are, and so I was left a little disappointed."
1,Worst movie,"I bought this movie, great blu ray quality. Movie is horrible. Not for kids at all. Story of a psycho kid, runs away... meets some psycho creatures. The whole time u r praying that it ends with a moral. Stupid predictable ending... kid runs back home, and smiles at mom. yeah yeah, i know. BUT still, hated the movie. I sold it to some co-worker for 10 bucks. I know there is a following to the book and people love this movie. Movie still stinks. DONT BUY IT. trust me."
1,Horrible!!,"This movie is horrible! It is obnoxious, creepy, and nothing makes sense. Spike, the script, the actors -all very bad. Why do we make movies like this for kids? Just crap!"
1,Not a PG movie,"This was billed as a great movie for the kids but it is definitely not a PG movie -- PG-13 at best, perhaps R.I started playing it for my 3, 5 and 7 years olds. When the boy jumped up on the kitchen counter in his animal pajamas and started screaming ""feed me, feed me"" at the top of his lungs to his hysterical mother, I shut off the movie and threw the DVD away."
1,my dog hated this movie,Are the reviews that gave this dark movie fives for real? Are they studio plants? I hope so. Only a Glenn Beck audience could enjoy something this depressing. My dog had to go into thearpy after seeing this movie and he was asleep. Rather than watch this movie go outside and play in the street!
3,Nice,"Nice family movie different from the book but I was expecting more to the ended, I love the lesson it was teach the children."
1,Very Disappointing -- do not waste your money!,"I loved the book as a kid, and was excited to see the movie; my wife purchased it for me for my 48 birthday. I sat down to watch it with my wife and two boys, and both parents and children were disappointed. I couldn't wait for Max to sail back in his boat. Bottom line, if you have an advanced degree in psychology -- as it appears most of the person's who gave this movie a good review do -- and want to explore the deeper themes of the movie afterwards, then by all means, purchase this movie. On the other hand, if you want a to watch a movie that is easily understood and entertaining, then this movie is not for you.In any event, buyer beware, kids will NOT like this movie, and some of the scenarios in the movie are both violent and disturbing for children."
1,BORING BORING AND MORE BORING,"I always wanted to watch this movie when it first came out but I decided to watch on DVD instead. Well I did and what a waste of time it was. I had no idea of what the movie was about. There no plot and the dialogs are boring and slow. Too bad I can't get 1.5 hrs back. Please don't buy this movie, find something else to buy instead. Spend your money wisely."
2,Disappointing,It was not very exciting and it just seemed a little too weird for me. Great movie for the kids though I suppose!
1,Not at all like the book,I was very disappointed in the movie. It was a great book and so I was expecting it to be at least a decent movie. It was not at all. It was a waste of time. the plot was lame and the monsters were idiotic. What a slap in the face for the book and all of those who were touched by it as a child.
2,Run Away!,"Here's an idea....Let's take a beloved classic book, engaging to all who read it -- A story about the power of imagination and the omnipotence of youth. Indeed an unforgettable journey.Now let's take this story and pillage all the color from the imagery and most of all, let's turn it into a Dr Phil psychosis episode about the difficulties of being a spoiled brat in a divorced upper middle class home.WTF?Yeah, Spike Jones pretty much took E.T. And turned Elliot into a post modern basket case brat in need of Ritalin. It's the same idea as if Larry Clark started out with a Sesame Street episode and that is how we got the movie ""Kids."". Elmo became Telly. Put a different name on it and you have a better movie, but this ain't WTWTA.Avoid at all costs. It's that bad."
2,Wild things,I bought this thinking it was a cartoon Something the kids would like to watch with us!You do not want your kids watching this film!
1,Boring,Watched this movie today with my kids. Even the kids thought it was boring. Not worth purchasing.
1,One of the worst.,"A friend brought this film over my house, and talked me into playing it. YUK! Boy am I sorry! I never remember reading the book or buying it for my kids when they were young. Anyway...A weird film about a spoiled kid who sails away to a far away land where a bunch of yukky looking dressed up animals/monsters/weirdos, (who knows?) whatever. They all talk and talk and talk and make no sense at all. The boy joins the escapade and they crown him a king. No idea why. Anyway, I never saw it to the end because it was so boring I fell asleep and I wasn't alone. My husband fell asleep too. Possibly another guest. Unless you like weird movies with no plot and no particular story, don't bother buying this film. It's awful."
5,"A little modification needed for 23AWG STP cable, but that is expected...","Used these on a Cat-6 23AWG STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) cable which is thicker than your normal 24-26AWG UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable so I did have to make the hole bigger by using a drill bit, twisting it in & out by hand a few times to shave some rubber off. This was easy to do (about 5 seconds for each boot) and they slid on the cable fine after that. My crimp ends now look professional. Nice product, great price."
3,Different color than advertised,I placed my order in December and received it a few days ago. Which shipping from Hong Kong was pretty fast. The problem I have is that the description said I was buying black strain relief boots and what I received were white!
5,Never crimp a CAT5 cable without them.,Good products at a very fair price. Necessary if you don't want to be continually replacing ends. They give the cable the needed support at the jack. I will order again. Thanks.
4,Work but ridged.,I used these with the R.J. Enterprises 50-Pack of RJ-45 connectors sold here and they are the perfect fit for them. Use a little moisture on your cable and they will slide right on and again to slide them into place over the connector. My only complaint is the part that covers the clip is very stiff and requires a lot of pressure to make the connector release from the receptacle.I'm still pleased enough with them that I will be buying them again.
5,Very Nice!,"These Relief Boots work great. They do what they are suppose to and are easy to use. If you are making a lot of patch cables, this is a good investment."
5,Scandishake is the BEST!,"I cannot rate this product highly enough. I am no fan of powdered supplement mixes. Never have been. They all taste chalky to me. I tried this product by accident after a relative's husband had passed away from cancer. He had been drinking them when nothing else was going down. I was astounded at how delicious the shake turned out to be! The powder dissolves completely, leaving no chalky residue at the bottom of the glass. With milk, it's absolutely wonderful, but add ice cream and it's like a premium shake! If you have a need for a supplement, this is the highest-cal you can get, AND - it's gluten-free!! I tried the chocolate and the vanilla and both were yummy!!"
5,Happy at last !!,"ScandiShake is all it claims to be. It tastes like a milk shake....I also add ice cream to it....Delish...... Pleased with service, and will order again. Thank you, Gloria Schwartz."
3,Very fun French Rap!,"I really like Diam's. I heard her when in Paris and liked the style. The CD is OK, as typical, only a few songs are really good."
1,This fan was crap,"Ordered this fan and installed it. Made things worse. And distracted me from diagnosing the problem. Which was the condenser fan after all. After several weeks and numerous additional troubleshooting steps, I discovered that this fan was running backwards. It was pushing hot engine compartment air through an even hotter radiator and then through the AC condenser. The AC did not work unless the car was moving. Big surprise. This unit either has the wrong motor or wrong blade. No deal here."
4,Fantastic but very complicated.,"As far as cook books go this is a fantastic book to opt for. It ranges from delicate sauces to the most complex of deserts. This book has only two flaws which in a sense are not real flaws. The first is that this book is definately designed for the experienced cook. Though it offers an explantion of many of the complicated tasks in its recipes, there is a lot of knowledge it takes for granted. So while this book is definately not for the rank amateur, with a combination of other books this could be a fantastic referece book to own. As for the second flaw, the ingredients required are not always the easiest to find. Some of the things neccessary for the recipes can not be found in your everyday super-market. But if you have access to some specialized markets you will be cooking like a professional in no time at all."
2,I never thought I'd say this but...,"Too much sex, too little emotional development between the characters. I bought all of McCarthy's work in one go and this was the first one I read. I think she's a refreshing author with her own voice so for that alone she gets my respect.Halfway through the book I had to put it down for a bit and I didn't really understand why - I was enjoying the read but then I realised I was on a sex train that only occasionally took character development pit stops. My brain was tired of the sex and as a result, I lost my connection with the characters or rather, my connection forged at the beginning of the novel wasn't allowed to grow.I mark this a 2/5 but I really mean 2.5 - and this is only because this author writes so much better (the proof is in her other titles) that in comparison to the others, it can't get higher than that."
2,I Say Pass!,"I agree with Bee Smith's review that the protagonists of MOUTH TO MOUTH are a couple of shallow, sex-starved people. In this novel, Erin McCarthy failed with her character development. I wasn't emotionally involved in this story and could care less when Russ and Laurel screwed each other senseless while trying to catch a con man out on the loose. The sex scenes were overrated--explicit but NOT erotic. Although the mistaken choking scene with Russ and his younger brother was quite amusing, everything else was bland. I skimmed thru much of this novel and bottom line: Non-compelling characters + insipid romance + lackluster plot = one heck of a boring romance novel!Save your cash. There are far better romance novels out there."
4,Worth Reading!,This was a pretty good book. I enjoyed the story and characters. There was humor in the book making it even more appealing. Lots of steamy sex scenes.I recommend this book.
5,great book!,Mouth to Mouth was a great book. I loved when authors have characters that aren't typical and I loved that fact that the heroine was deaf. It was a fast read and I didn't want to put it down.
5,"""Good Cop*Great Love Story!""","Only the first Erin McCarthy Book I've read..............(I will confess...the man on the cover did it for me!)This is a story that will have you at 'Hello'.....From the minute he walks into the coffee shop (wanting only plain black coffee...haha) and Laurel greets him like she knows him..............you will be hooked.She is a rich girl living with her mother (oh, you'll love her!)Russ is a detective(wow, how sexy is that)and every sensual, explicit loving romance or sex scene was ""to die for!"" ahhhhhhThe entire experience of reading this book will leave you feeling completely satisfied ***well except I could have read more about these two (at leas 1000 more pages).............Every character is fabulous and utterly jump off the pages to life! I have just gone back to order all (yes all) of her books..............Thank you Thank you ...........enough written word for at least 3 weeks!!! yippeeIt is a complete truth when I say It was a pleasure to read every word"
4,Anna Sui Dolly Girl,This scent is very reminiscent ofDolce and Gabana's Light Blue it's a little sweeter just as fresh but has a lingering bitter dry down... The bottle is very cute I gave it too my sister I don't think it agrees with my chemistry
4,"Its like being a kid again, only with better skills.","Fun model for you car heads out there, almost to easy to put together except for the working scissor doors but I have large hands and they had wee lil screws that I couldn't hold on to. It came on Friday, it was painted, dried and fully assembled by Sunday afternoon. This was the first model car I have made since I was probably 8 years old. Most of this things parts are all put together outta the box which kinda killed the fun of it."
1,Returned the item,"Wow, the top screw is not attached to the unit, it just sits on it , also is steel over aluminium so you cant bind them together, it is wobbely, the trailer is all over the place when standing on it, It was cheap , it was an Open box, it was returned already by somebody else, and now i had to return it.i have tryed to think how to make it better, maybe attach the screw to the base, but i gave up, it is not possible,Sorry that i have to say but ...Dont buy it.was easy to return the item, amazon was great , i'll give them that"
4,Great Stand's,These are good light duty stands. The only problem is when you get a load on it and try to raise by hand the circular piece on top does not want to turn and will bend/shape to what ever you are resting on it. If it is holding an axle it will form to a cancave shape. Still a usable stand.
4,Good jack stand but small.,I use them for my tent trailer. They are a bit smaller than I had hoped but worked after placing some wood under them.
5,Very sturdy,"I am very happy with these stacking shelves. They do not slide around and are very sturdy, I use them to store canned goods so there is plenty of weight to hold them in place but even with lighter goods they I don't think there would be a problem. If you're looking for an inexpensive way to expand your storage options this is a good choice."
5,Very useful,"I first bought two of the larger shelves to send to college for dorm storage. I wanted something that took up little space and was easy to transport. They are perfect. My son used them on a closet shelf to expand his storage space for canned and packaged items. At the end of the semester, we just folded the legs and they stored flat again.I recently purchased this size, actually as a mistake. I had wanted the larger ones that I purchased last time. Pay attention when ordering! Anyway, this size is great too. He will not only be able to use them on the closet shelf but can use the smaller one on the bathroom sink/vanity area or on his dresser.They are a bit expensive but they are well made and can have many uses.Even my college aged son thinks that this was a really good and useful purchase."
1,Stacks and stacks does not deliver and has poor customer service,"I ordered 2 of these shelves (they were the perfect size for my needs), and after 2 weeks had not heard anything from the company (Stacks and Stacks) about whether or not it had shipped. I sent them an email asking where the items were, and they responded that the item is discontinued and they then canceled my order. So, the item was NEVER in stock (despite the fact that it STILL says it is in stock on this page!), and not only that, they never bothered to tell me so until I asked them. I realize this is not a ""big"" item, but it still warrants proper customer service.Don't buy this item! You'll never get it."
3,questions are indicative of what will be on exam,"use the book as a reference tool to gauge which areas you need to study more, then use the recommended reading list provide by the state department to find the appropriate texts to aid you. the english expression section format is changing in '99, but the goals are still the same- identifying grammatically correct, concise sentences (buy the study guide from ACT to see the new format). also refer to the information in the ACT study guide regarding the essay and oral examinations."
2,Book is very out-dated,"Having taken and passed the test, I can attest to the accuracy of some of the book, but the help it gives for the oral section is basically useless. Too bad there aren't any other choices. Oh well..."
1,The material related to the oral assessment is dated.,"The foreign service oral assessment changed significantly at about the time this book was published. Candidates for the foreign service should trust the description of the oral assessment contained in the registration materials, not the description in this book."
2,Disappointed,"I tried a few recipes but they didn't come out so well. I'm not a very good cook but I can follow a recipe. What I made didn't poison anyone but it wasn't what I expected, having heard so much about this book."
5,Criolla cooking a t it's finest,"I remember seeing this book in my aunts and mothers homes for years.I wanted a cookbook that continued traditional Puerto Rican cookery, and it was just the ticket."
4,Excelente Reeferencia,He tratando varias recetas y estoy muy satisfecho con los resultados. Ha sido una muy buena compra. El libro es vieja escuela y es parte de su encanto.
5,Very complete cook book,"The book is very helpful, informative, great recipes, and includes a variety of natives puertorrican recipes. Only for Spanish speakers, the author also had an English version."
5,amazing...,"This is the best book I've ever read. Period. The poetry is simultaneously sarcastic and emotional, humble and commanding, wandering and powerful. Highly recommended to anyone who loves written words of any sort."
1,Horrible!,"This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read.The words used in this book are rude. The habitsin this book are horrible. Children should not eventhink about being so disrespectful to their teachers,parents, and other adults. This book was a bad write.Spend your time and money reading other books ofbetter quality."
2,This One Is Over The Top,"I have just recently read through this book and as an early childhood educator I find this book inappropriate to say the least. I know the importance of having books that children can relate to and to have books that teach them how to handle things correctly but, showing a little girl passing gas and monsters shaped like buttocks...I think not. I would love to know if this author has ever sat down in an early childhood classroom and tried reading this book to young children??? Children emulate what they see and hear. Can't we give them something a little more concrete to go on then a father who make his little girl smell her own gas???"
5,Good Overview,"This book has a good overview of many subjects, but tends to try to answer so many questions too quickly. The early section on making wine is good, but I felt like I was taking a 3-hour tour of San Francisco. Granted that the subtitle is ""an introductory guide to the grape"", it could have been less rushed and used the same amount of space. The sections on the different AVAs are excellent -- some of the best informative condensed coverage that I have read. The list of preferred producers of each type is very good, without tying down to specific prices or vintages. The brief list of 10-bottle and 20-bottle starter collections at the back is very helpful (and very similar to what I started with!). Good book. The informative casual cartoons convinced me to change it from four stars to five stars."
4,Excellent comi book,"I really enjoyed this work of art. It captures the book's essential drama, and adds to it a visual perspective that is beautiful and matches my imagination.Wish it were cheaper.Leon"
4,Hilarious! Stellar Cast & One of Candy's Best!,"Although somewhat dated, this is a hilarious film and one of John Candy's best. It is nonstop, madcap humor and slapstick with some funny sexual situations thrown in for good measure. Who can forget the twisted ""Father Knows Best"" sequences shown to brainwash John Candy's character against his father-in-law Ed Reese? Another memorable and hilarious character is Mohammed Jerome Willy, outlaw, who meets a rather unusual but stimulating demise.Featuring a stellar cast, this is one movie you'll enjoy watching over and over again.If you are lucky enough, also record it on TV--there was a different version made for television (cleaned up, of course), but the TV version features different scenes from the theatrical release."
2,"The good, the bad, and the stupid","The subtitle THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE STUPID appears on what seems to be the poster or C.D. box cover of the 1983 comedy GOING BERSERK. It's an apt summary of the film, which not often enough is good (as in funny) and too often bad or stupid. Fans of either the late, great John Candy or television's SECOND CITY TELEVISION will find GOING BERSERK worth a look for the antics of Candy and his S.C.T.V. cohorts Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy. One segment, a send-up of 1950s family T.V. shows, could be right out of S.C.T.V.. But GOING BERSERK never gels, leaving mostly Candy to keep it amusing and he hits and misses."
1,Horrible,"This film was hard to watch. There is no plot to speak of, only random jokes that don't connect with each other with disjointed story telling. It's like they just put several movies in a blender and hit ""play."" The jokes themselves are not funny. There is a scene with Ernie Hudson that made me chuckle, but that was the exception. Had the jokes at least been entertaining, the movie would have gone down easy despite the lack of a plot. As it stands, this is an example of how not to make a movie, especially when you have talent like John Candy on hand."
1,Huh??,"I don't know what movie every other reviewer here saw, but the one I saw was titled ""Going Berserk"" starring John Candy. Now, I'm all in favor of film preservation, but this is one movie that deserves to be burned and forgotten forever, as a service to everyone involved with it.The film plays like each scene was written by different people, none of whom ever saw or communicated with any of the others. It's simply a series of disconnected sketches, none of which relate to each other. I notice a few reviewers say, never mind the plot--that's because there isn't one to mind. Nothing makes the slightest bit of sense, even within the context of the movie. And nothing is funny. I may have chuckled once during the whole interminable 84 minutes I subjected myself to this thing.No one seems to be aware that this movie _is_ available on DVD. Good. Maybe the rest of the world will be spared the torture."
4,new favorite driving CD,"I played this three times in a row, back-to-back, on a road trip this weekend. I bought the CD after hearing just one song on a local college radio station, and now I can't get them out of my head. I love the sultry beat, the groove. Reminds me of a hot summer night in the city."
1,taking the turn,this movie made me sick to my stomach!!!! the worst acting I have ever seen .who told these guys they were actors . this is very sad . doug eldridge should be shot.
3,Needs Improvement,I agree with an earlier reviewer that the book is a good reference and the overwhelming details contained in it make it difficult to get the basic fundamentals. The authors need to trim it down and focus more on fundamental principles. I feel at times the book is somewhat convoluted and hard to follow. This is sometimes the case with books that have multiple authors.Another reviewer pointed out the over abundance of yeast molecular biology contained in he book. I again agree with this person. I realize yeast is where we learned a lot about eukaryotic molecular biology. But I wish the book focused less on yeast and more mammalian cell biology. People using this book are likely to be looking at careers in biomedical research or medicine. I think more mammalian biology would be more beneficial.Why do all these textbooks have to have a CD to run the price of the book up ?
3,Not as good as I had hoped,Some of the chapters are confusing (even my Professor agreed). The diagrams occassionally are inaccurate and misleading. And it could be more readable.
4,"Molecular Cell Biology, fifth edition",In my opinion the product is at excellent condition as it was described. There are just minor defect on the bottom two corners of the cover but nothing noticeable. The slightest problem was the fact that the delivery was delayed for two weeks. But apart from this I am satisfied with the product.
3,Overwhelming Details,"As a reference book, this book is handy to have. As a primary textbook for the classroom, this book is impossible. Each subsection of each chapter is overwhelmed with details of a process as it pertains to a variety of model systems. With the increasing amount of information on molecular biology available to us, it becomes vital that authors are able to extract key concepts, present them clearly, and then support them with detailed examples. The authors of this book instead have presented page after page of details, leaving the reader to wonder exactly what it was they were supposed to glean from the forgoing monolith. I found Albert's text to be far superior in readability and organization."
2,Too many authors undermine coherence,"This text is excellent in the coverage of its subject matter, but, like typical texts and journal articles written by a myriad of authors, it lacks coherence. Thus, separating the wheat from the chaff is tedious. The book, if well written, could be much shorter and more readable than it currently is."
3,"Content good, organization bad","I like this book. There's a good amount of content, accompanied with excellent illustrations. However, the organization is pretty bad -- instead of describing processes such as transcription in a natural sequence, the authors jump around from one thing to another, making it hard to find things. The index isn't comprehensive enough, either.one more caveat: my Cell Phys professor, who's a botanist, complained about the lack of coverage of plant cells, and he's right."
2,Scatterbrained,"This book is so scattered and disjointed. Topics don't flow, random jumps are made, and the text is written poorly to top it off. If you're going to get a cell biology book, get Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fourth Edition by Bruce Alberts. Might be a bit thicker but for the same price you get much better information."
2,Poorly Organized,"Prof. Lodish obviously knows his Biology, but his textbook is very poorly organized. The amount of information thrown in each section is random and excessive at times, convoluting the fundamental concepts being introduced. The illustrations were very good in portraying the basic concepts, but the text was very poorly organized. Not recommended as a good intro text for Cell Biology, even at the late undergrad level."
2,Ok,"The beads are ok, i expected it to be a little 'fuller'. I would not recommend buying this because it leaves your hands BLACK from dust or residue as soon as you touch the beads!"
1,Dont believe the picture,"The picture used should really be some kind of false advertisement... Why even call it a ""curtain""? More like widely spread out, cheaply made strands of bamboo, that dangle there. If you are looking for a ""beaded Curtain"" dont look here."
2,is this the best?,"I've really enjoyed the other Nuclear Blast compilation series but this was a letdown. Perhaps one shouldn't expect the best songs in compilations but if you want to highlight your bands and get people interested in buying the band's CDs, then this compilation is not going to help encourage this. Overall I felt it was weak."
5,Best Black Metal Compilation Ever,"This VA Compilation is my favorite along with Nordic Metal-A tribute to Euronymous. Although, it has only mainstream tracks (unlike Nordic Metal) every single track is f***ing great and uplifting."
2,Mata adds a little spark to Ormandy's tired Copland,"Eugene Ormandy obviously knew he was stepping on Bernstein's toes by recording Copland's most famous score. Nobody involved could have thought that Ormandy's polite, rhythmically mild Appalachina Spring came close, and his Billy the Kid never hurt anyone in his life. But back then Ormandy was nearly as big a name with the record-buying public as Bernstein, and his fans wouldn't care. As a result, we get gorgeous playing frorm the orchestra and impactful sound--though not the best that Living Stereo has to offer--all in service of very dull performances.For me, the main attraction was hearing Edurdo Mata's contribution. This talented Mexican maestro died young, and I missed him the first time around. He conducts a lively four scenes from Copland's Rodeo ballet , by far the best thing here, but his El Salon Mexico (ironically for a native-born musician) sounds anemic next to Bernstein's."
2,QUITE DISAPOINTED,WHEN MY DVD'S ARRIVED I COULD HARDLY WAIT TO WATCH THEM. MUCH TO MY SURPRISE THERE WERE ONLY 2 MOVIES I LIKED. AND BOTH WERE IN COLOR. ALL THE OTHERS WERE OLD MOVIES IN BLACK AND WHITE. I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED.
4,Very nice package of movies.,I purchased this basically for two movies but it was a great deal for all. The only con is that these packaged movies don't look that great on a bigger screened HDTV. Looks blown up too much. Still a good deal especially if you have a standard definition TV.
5,Gift,Great buy! I purchased this for a gift for my sister because she loves Christmas movies. She loves it and she is still watching these movies.
5,An excellent history,"A very detailed book, sometimes more than one wants to know, but the insight into both governments as well as the ships themselves made for fine reading. A lot of effort went into this book."
5,A Premier Reading Experience,"I wish I could take all the five-star reviews I have written and change them to four star reviews, so that I could adequately express how great a book this is. There is not a bad chapter in the book, and I read it more avidly than any book I can remember. The accounts of the sea battles--Coronel, Falkland Islands, Helgoland Bight, Dogger Bank, Jutland,--are very well-done and make those events clearer to us than to the people who fought them. This is a sheerly stupendous work and anyone who has any interesst in World War One will be thankful he or she has lived to be able to read it. The only mistake I noted is that he refers to ""Senator Williams of Tennessee"" when he means ""Senator Williams of Mississippi."" Other than that one mistake this is a perfect book and is I am sure the winner of my ""Best Book Read Award"" for this year."
5,For the Audio Book on CD - not the printed book,"The contents are excellent, well researched, balanced, and well presented.I will let others comment on the content, I want to comment on the audio book (on 33 CDs)I VERY much enjoyed the reader, probably the best I've come across in audio books.I listened to it while running (35 hours spread across a couple of months), and it was a pleasure. I'm sad to have finished it. Too bad DREADNOUGHT isn't available on CD so I could listen to it while running :)"
3,"two titles - ""Dreadnought"" & ""Castles of Steel""","Both interesting, well-written but too longwinded. Too much time spent on details which, tho' interesting in themselves, are unnecessary to the thrust of the main story. Half the size would have been perfectly adequate.Douglas Dicconson"
1,Absolutely the worse,"These holders do not protect from heat. As someone else noted, after 2 to 3 seconds, you DO feel the heat. They also singe easily, even when you're simply holding a very hot item (like off of the grill). They look cute (which gets 1 star), but they're going in the trash if I can't return them."
3,Suitably Soothing,"I have a number of recordings by Llewelyn and some I like more than others. He has a particular style and sometimes he hits the feeling I want better than at other times. I hear things in this CD which are reminiscent of earlier recordings and that isn't bad; but, since it is all intended to be soothing, a feeling of redundancy can creep in. Not unhappy with my choice and I'll probably bet something else by him; maybe in collaboration with another artist."
5,A Real Catch!,"Petite enough to fit in purse or pocket, it gives more than 3,000 American-English idioms with their meanings. ""Cold as Ice"" and many other American idioms are composed of simple words. A cool reference guide for ESL students, foreign travelers in the US, and anybody else. They are listed alphabetically, ID'd according to their part of speech, and categorized as formal, informal, slang, or literary. Every expression is defined and supplemented with an illustrative sentence."
4,very comprehensive,this book is a little too extensive. For someone looking to learn idioms and prominent phrasal verbs this book is too overwhelming. Wading through thousands of entries without knowing which are relatively more prevalent than others is a less than optimal allocation of one's time and resources. Perhaps a way of rating and sorting entries by their importance and prevalence would have helped a lot!
2,know what you are buying...before you buy it.,"If you are getting this to learn anything new, don't waste you're time. Everything in this book a small child probably already knows. The most basic of language is in this book. This book should be labeled very differently, I gave it the low score because its basically of no use to the majority of people that will buy it to use for writing. Its a good book if you don't know a lot of English, like someone who speaks Spanish and is trying to learn English. Remember, buyer beware."
1,Missing 20 pages,"I don't know if this is the case for anyone else, but there are literally 20 or so pages absent from my copy of this book. (Pages 533-552) That in itself is disappointing, but on top of that, many of the other criticisms are spot on -- the book has 24,000 entries, but you have to page through hundreds of variations of the same phrase to find anything meaningful. If you are getting this reference tool for writing, search elsewhere."
2,To Please a Lady,"I have always enjoyed susan johnson's books, she has written some very good books in the past, but i was deeply disappointed with this one. There seemed to be very little in a storyline to the book. The characters were somewhat flat and at the end of the book, I was just a little baffled as to why it took that many pages for the story. but i did keep reading in vain that the story would pick up. Hopefully this is the only book i'll be disappointed with in her catalog."
1,Disappointing !!!,I've read almost all of Susan Johnson's book and To Please a Lady a very disappointing read. So's A Touch of Sin. The writer didn't seem to put a lot of thought in these 2 books. All i can say is don't waste your money. Ms Johnson didn't seem to care when she was writing these books. It is so unfair to the readers.
2,Not impressed,This is the first book by Susan Johnson that I have read and I must say I was not impressed. The history lesson was good but I struggled to finish the story. The main characters were likeable but I was never convinced that them ending up together would be a good thing. I had a very hard time buying into the whole storyline.
1,Don't waste your time or money on this subpar effort,"I used to buy Susan Johnson's books the moment they were published but not anymore. I wish I'd read some of the reviews before I shelled out my money.Here's my advice: Don't bother with this book if you're looking for an interesting hero, worthy of a strong heroine's love - the hero is an 18 year old Scottish Donald Trump (the Donald's money AND attitude toward women!). Don't bother with this book if you like to read stories where the main characters actually spend time together - they spend as much time apart as together with just a few love scenes. And please don't bother with this book if you enjoyed Ms. Johnson's sexy love scenes from Sinful, Wicked, or Blaze - you won't find enough here to make it worth reading. I suggest you re-read Sinful for the best of Ms. Johnson."
1,A tree died...,"Terrible. What has happened to Susan Johnson? This book and Touch of Sin have been simply awful. I am saddened that a tree had to die to print this book. The plot completely unbelievable, and the characters whiney. Don't waste your money and buy these two books."
4,Another Good Susan Johnson Book!,"I am a avid reader of all historical romances. I must say that I have found no other author who can touch a heart and soul like Susan Johnson. This book is one of my favorites...a sequal... Once again, showing why Susan Johnson is the best historical-romance author!"
2,"It was not one of her best, I was very disappointed!!","Susan Johnston is known for juicy and erotic love scences and all of that was missing in this book,after this I don't think I will be buying anymore of her books.First the hero is an eighteen year old who has basically lived a full life,he is in my opinion infactuated with a twice widowed mother of 5 and soon to be twins with the hero.the lovemaking in the book is very tame compare to her other novels,she has another one due out next year if I do get it I would rather saved myself the money by getting the book from the library."
2,This lady was NOT pleased,"This one is for all your prudes who complain about excessive sex in Susan Johnson novels. This one, I will personally vouchsafe, is impeccably clean. I did not quite get what the danger in the book was all about , because Roxanne had to be shut up in some house in the beginning for a very long time. Robbie is more of a whining teenage boy, if that's the type of lover you prefer. Also, Roxanne has kids, which kind of diminished the exciting factor of romance novels. The lead antagonist is Argyll who lusts for Roxanne, but he gets vanished after a few chapters, though it would have been nice if he reappeared to show some consistency. Too clean and too boring"
1,Not the best but certainly the least!,"This is the worst of SJ book I have ever read. First of all Robbie Carr is too young, at 18 and spoil, selfish and acts like a child all the time, doesn't constitue what a man should be like. Sorry readers but I enjoy romance and love hot steamy sex but this book lacks everything. The only reason I finish this book was because I spend money on it and also I wanted to know more about Elizabeth and Johnnie(Outlaw). If I had to suggest a book it would be Outlaw and that readers you will get your money worth"
2,Probably the weakest of Susan Johnson's novels,"After reading Susan Johnson's novel, A Touch of Sin, I rushed to find and read her other books. I've read her entire library and enjoyed every title. I was really looking forward to her new novel, To Please A Lady. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this book! It seems that Ms. Johnson has not put the effort into this novel that she has put into the others - as I was reading I wondered if the book was written to fufill a contract. Ms. Johnson's other novels were full of historical detail, great characters, and incredibly erotic love scenes. This books seems to be missing all of those! I never really liked the hero, and the heroine was the sterotypical romantic leading lady and not the strong woman that Ms. Johnson usually writes. The best part of the book was the prequel to Ms. Johnson's next, unnamed novel. Come back Susan, we miss you!"
2,Not as good as usual,"The two main characters in this book already knew each other when it wtarted. There were references made to their past together and how he had seduced her before (it was in her previous books). So, basically, they were already in love when the book started. We don't even get to enjoy their falling in love. I normally love her books, but this one fell short of what I have come to expect from Ms. Johnson."
1,YUCK!!!,"I honestly dont know where to start with this book. I guess for starters, I dont see the huge age gap between Roxie and Robbie sexy in the least. The whole book, I was trying to imagine Robbie as being older and Roxie as being younger. But the biggest thing for me was the yo-yo romance. Up one minute down the next. Very tiring! The only reason I finished was because I cant stand not finishing a book I start. I DO NOT reccomend this book to anyone."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Clearly Susan Johnson has lost some of her earlier creativity. This book doesn't measure up to her others at all. I was amazed to see so many negative reviews, but since I love her writing, decided to disregard the reviews and buy it anyway. Big Mistake! I didn't even finish it. Next time, I'll read these reviews first."
3,music4us,The CD arrived fast and that was appreciated. However it tends to freeze up and I can't keep the case together. For the price I am satisfied with the product.Thanks
2,Not what I thought it would be.,"I thought this would be a tape of music for children. I looked up children's music and this CD came up. I thought it would be a tape of songs for nap time. Well, it isn't! It talks about getting tested at the doctor's, all sorts of weird and depressing songs, being drunk, drugs. Not at all what I hoped for. I hope I can give it away!"
5,Beatiful vocals...,"...This album will Soothe your soul in a way U will find yourself Smiling all the way to the end of it......I Personally will recommend it to any one who Love's Real Classic Soul...U will never go wrong with this one, but it with Confidence when U find it... Dj Kudzin..."
2,an overly-opinionated read,"This book is very biased. It was hard to read even as a homosexual with intent to marry. I was looking for more factual information to support my argument for a research paper but read a whole lot more overly-opinionated monologue than fact. It felt like I was observing a one-sided argument at the bar.A fun read if you relish in your anger towards the hindering of gay rights, but it won't do much for you if you are trying to make a healthy argument."
5,The Best,"No secrets revealed, but the best in magic shows!! I remeber watching these with the family when I was growing up."
3,You must be-liee-hee-heve me!,"2 Albums for the price of one, you can find 10 songs on here you like. The sound of The Hollies is amazing, I fell in love with them all over again, even on the dingiest of tracks their vocals soar. Play with the balance control is you don't believe me, isolate the vocals on I Can't Let Go and you'll see what I mean. They are the Everly Bros. with 3-part harmony on speed. I try not to let my taste get in the way of my reviews, because otherwise this would have got 4 stars. Great if you're tired of the hits and want to hear some earlier stuff from them."
4,Good read,First Krueger book I have read. The plot moved along well and I look forward to reading more of his books.
1,bad,"All the songs seem really slow and tired and melancholy. With appearances by the likes of Chris Martin, it should sound that way, but this just goes too far and the songs seem too repetitive (I really do like Chris in Coldplay).There is one track with exception to the typical sound - the song where cannibal ox throws down a rap rhyme just to keep the kids in touch with their funky side. Yo. I didn't like that sound either.I think the photos in the CD booklet are indicitive of the music on the CD. Lets see, there is a photo of a wrench, an electrical outlet adapter, a remote control, a camera, and a water bottle. Yay."
3,TRACK LISTING & Item description:,This is a japanese import EP featuring remixes by Satoshi Tomiie for Tony Toni Tone's first single from House of Music and also a remix for their follow-up of Thinking of You. This release has additonal remixes by Satoshi Tomiie that are not available on the US CD Single.TRACKS:1. Let's Get Down (Club Mix)2. Let's Get Down (Oil Shock Mix)3. Let's Get Down (Dramatized Club Mix)4. Let's Get Down (Fitzcarraldo Dub)5. Thinking of You (Radio Remix)6. Thinking of You (LP No Intro)
2,Not bad but audit dubbing is.,"Like the Victory at Sea 50th anniversary edition, this series suffers from very poor audio dubbing. The commentary is muted to the left channel and loud sound effects and music drowns out the commentary. Not all the time, but enough that you have to keep adjusting the volume. It's too bad, the stories told by the pilots are riveting, but you have to at times strain to hear them or quickly adjust the volume after the sound effects our music dies down. I would recommend another set over this. The Readers Digest WWII series is very good and does not suffer from poor audio dubbing as these."
3,Somewhat disappointed at the quality of the book.,"I am a person who really loves books. I can probably find one for you from 5 years ago that looks new because I treat them with care. This book was soiled and I just hate holding it. Maybe I am strange but somehow I didn't even realize that I was ordering a used book. My fault, I know, but I was so disappointed."
5,I didn't want this book to END!!!,"I have a large collection of Chicken Soup books. Ordered this one AND the African American Woman's Soul at the same time. This book was the BEST! In fact, of the top THREE Chicken Soup favorites, this is my second choice.First choice is the first book.Chicken Soup for the SoulThird Choice is Chicken Soup for the Soul: Inspiration for the Young at Heart.Now if you want truly good reading-- take those three books and you have the Academy Awards of Chicken Soup books!I'm hoping they publish another African American Soul book! I'll be first in line to buy it."
4,"Great cookbook, with just a couple of minor flaws","What a great book! I'm a big fan of Devin Alexander's recipes so I picked up this book and I'm totally loving it. Mostly healthy and fast (and yummy) recipes in this cookbook.I have a couple of quibbles that forced me to give the book 4 stars instead of 5. As another reviewer said, a grocery list would have been nice. But my biggest issue is that the recipes are not broken down into the Biggest Loser 4-3-2-1 pyramid that is mentioned in the front part of the book. I have to break the recipes down myself, which is a real pain!Also, a little too much info about the Biggest Loser contestants in the cookbook....I've never even seen the US version of the show, so it was neither helpful nor inspiring to me to read that a specific recipe was a contestant's favorite. However, I understand that this is in fact a ""Biggest Loser"" cookbook, so I can't complain about it all that much!But still, great recipes and I look forward to more of Devin's books!"
5,The Biggest Loser cookbook,I absolutely loved this book. There are plenty of recipes that I will be cooking. The hints about cutting back and substituting certain items because of sodium or caleries was very helpful.The day I finished reading it my aunt looked through it and found many recipes that she liked. I gave her my book and ordered another one.
2,Too Much Sodium!,"I've watched a few episodes of the Biggest Loser and was curious about what the show offered as sample recipes. However, I would not recommend any from this book as they are very high in sodium. I was surprised to see this as I thought they would be healthier. I suggest that you buy a lot of vegetables and broil your meats if you are interested in losing weight. Keep it simple. Make salads and measure all of the ingredients you use, especially salad dressing (lots of calories and sodium in most of those). Even better, make your own dressing or just use olive oil and vinegar. I recommend the Harvard School of Public Health Healthy Eating Pyramid:[...]It's easier to understand and more accurate than the USDA food pyramid, which makes no sense at all since they changed it.I ended up checking out this book from the library and I suggest you should too, if you can stomach the salt. Otherwise, save your money for food."
2,Disappointment,"This particular Big Loser Cookbook was a Big disappointment. If you are a big fan of the tv show, you might find it entertaining but as far as daily menu planning and how the contestants really did it day to day, it was a disappointment.The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show"
4,Packing,"Product was great, packing was horrible. When this product was received, it came in a box 10 times the size of the product with only 2 air packing bags enclosed which did nothing to stop the product from moving around the box."
5,Great vendor,The Biggest Loser cookbook was a very reasonable price. It arrived quickly and was in great shape. I highly recommend this vendor.
5,Not Just For Dieters,"Love it. According to my husband I have a slight addiction to cookbooks but this cookbook I would not have looked at since I'm not looking to be the Biggest Loser. My coworker (who is a fitness attict) brought it in to work and I started to look at it. I was hooked and had to purchase it myself. I have made 3 meals so far and they are healthy, SIMPLE, and small portion sizes so you don't always have to cook a meal for 8. This cookbook is for anyone who wants to cook a nutritious meal that they do not have to feel guilty about in the morning. Then I also have the Paula Deen collection for the other days!!"
3,Little Disappointed,"The recipes seem to repeat themselves and don't have a great variety among them. When eating healthy, I try to find a variety of tastes in recipes and this book didn't seem to have them. Great on desert ideas though. And the recipes are simple enough. I do prefer the Light and Tasty recipes or Quick and Easy recipes better."
2,Biggest Loser,"This book is sorely lacking in good ""normal"" recipes. It seems to reinvent wraps and omelets in a ton of different ways, but nothing really interesting or the recipes contain ingredients that I wouldn't have on hand. Chucked it away in the cupboard...what a waste"
5,Great cookbook for non-cooks,"I have made most of the recipes in this cookbook without any trouble. I am not an experienced cook, but I have successfully created these dishes with ingredients that are easy to find at almost any grocery store. For low-calorie food, it is really tasty. The sweet potato fries are now a family staple. We also love the muscle meatballs. I have never owned a more useful cookbook."
2,Not good so far,"I had very high hopes for this, and so far it's not living up to the hope. The two recipes I tried, which I followed exactly, were very bland."
3,Okay,"This book had okay recipes, but none that really were exciting. Low fat options were available, but not that tasty."
3,Pretty good!,"I've been watching the TV show for the past three seasons. My only wish is that this book were not so ""old"" as it contains information from previous contestants with whom I am unfamiliar. I've tried out a few of the recipes and have started to incorporate some of the principles in my grocery shopping. So far, pretty good!"
3,Didn't have very many appealing recipes.,"I flipped through this about 5 times, and only about 2 or 3 recipes looked good to me, and I'm not a picky eater--believe me! Stick with Weight Watchers cookbooks, they're way better!"
3,Decent recipes,"I purchased this as I am trying to increase my cooking skills and improve my health through eating right. I really enjoy the show, and there are several really good recipes, but that are many that were a disappointment. You also need to be careful with calories and fat content on several of the recipes. My recommendation is to purchase Chris Carmichael's book ""5 Essentials for a Winning Life"". It has some challenging recipes, but they are very good and you can feel the difference when you eat correctly.I guess the main thing to remember is that everyone is different, so what works for me may not work for you. Good luck with your goals!"
3,Still using it today!,"I bought this book as an additional tool to the Biggest Loser Weight Loss book and found I still use it today after reaching my goal weight. The recipes are simple to prepare and easy on the budget. I lost 40+ pounds using this book and the weight loss book. The food is delicious compared to other diets I've tried and don't take hours or weird ingredients to prepare. I was a college student when I first began using this book and found it could fit any lifestyle which is definitely necessary when attempting long-term, sustainable weight loss.I did the weight loss program with my mother who is about 30 years older than I am and she achieved average sucess (she does have metabolism issues) so if you're a special case in terms of weight loss, you may want to look for something more tailored to your specific needs. For the average joe trying to shed some pounds though, this is the book for you. It's a great and easy way to jumpstart any weight loss program."
4,good book,This book is nice in that it has colored pictures and fairly simple recipes. I would recommend it.
4,Biggest Loser cookbook,This cook book has alot to offer and very easy to plan a healthy meal for my family. Fast and tastey food.
5,GREAT Cookbook!,"We use this more than any of our many cookbooks. Tasty, quick, easy, healthy. Best money we've spent on a cookbook, and we have lots!"
4,Love it!!,I love this cookbook! I've cooked several dishes from it and so far they have all be GREAT!!
3,Great chef - NOT.,"The recipes used in this book are above and beyond how I usually cook. I'm definitely a down-home type cook and these are definitely fancier than my husband and I every eat. We're willing to try some of these recipes, but I was hoping for some recipes that aren't as ""high-class"" as what the majority of these recipes are. If you enjoy experimenting and trying a lot of new, more exotic recipes, these would be great!! Unfortunately, I'm not that experimental and I will probably just use the Biggesst Loser calorie counter book and keep track of my calories that way."
4,"Great, I love it!","This is a great Cookbook! I use it all the time. The only problem is the servings. Most recipes are portioned for only one or two servings. I cook for a family of 5. It has great lunch and snack ideas, I love all the input and recipes from the show contestants."
4,Very Good,"This has great recipes! I love the fact that a lot of them are for smaller numbers of people, great for when cooking for 1 or 2. Also, includes fiber count which is helpful if you are following certain weight loss plans"
2,good intentions but...,"The cookbook had too many recipes with sugar subsitutes, sugar free and other foods you might not eat. How about using less sugar perhaps. i will continue to use paula deen."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a book that was filled with recipes that the show and/or trainers had the contestants eating to help them lose the weight. Instead it was full of recipes the contestants themselves came up with after the fact. Just okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Creative recipe names."
2,Okay but not what I was looking for...,I mistakenly thought that the cookbook would be written by professional chefs with assist nutritionally by a dietitician. It is mostly recipes and tips that the contestants themselves like and use - some are okay but most of them are ones you can make up on your own. I wanted good flavor food with a healthy nutritional content. Would not recommend it to others.
3,biggest loser,Some of the recipes are rather hard you really have to concentrate on the items you need to get at the store. Not an easy cookbook but if applied would help out. You won;t have much f the ingred. on hand. But it is a nice cookbook if you are serious about losing weight.
4,Great Book,"This was a very good purchase. Lots of really healthy recipes. I haven't actually cooked any yet, but I'd say this was a good purchase."
2,Loser,Did not find the recipes useful for our everyday lives.We are not interested in the visual bodies of the players. We already saw them on television.We are on a diet and don't eat any of these products. I felt it was a waste of money
2,the biggest loser cookbook Sample,I just wanted to see the table of contents or a sample recipe . But noooooo. Just blah blah. How can I buy a cookbook without good info?
2,Cookbook,Wonderful cookbook. Hated the shipping. Took too long. Ordered it on the 21st of Feb and didn't get it until March 4th.
3,cookbook,"This purchase was a bit disappointing, as I did not find the recipes very useful or realistic."
4,Biggest Loser Cookbook,"This is the 1st Biggest Loser Cookbook. There are some good recipes in this edition in addition to some helpful hints to achieve a healthy lifestyle. However, we do prefer the 2nd Biggest Loser Family Cookbook. Some of the recipes are the same in each Cookbook, but have different names. The 1st Cookbook is a great start, but I suggest either getting both of them or just the Biggest Loser ""Family"" Cookbook because its more family oriented as far as portions and the recipes are definitely more wallet ($$) friendly."
5,Some really outstanding healthy recipes in here!,"I really enjoy this cookbook. I'm not much for cooking, but there are recipes for every type of cook in here. I found some really easy ones that I love to make that even my husband enjoys! it's also very motivating to hear from others who have had struggles similar to my own. I'd definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to live a healthy lifestyle!"
2,Not For Me,"I was disappointed with recipes that only serve one and have ingredients (brand name specific, herbs/seasonings, etc.) that are generally not in my frig or pantry. I cook for more than one and having to have a calculator and shopping list for each meal is not my cup of tea. I'll stick to my all-time favorite collection of cookbooks by Joanna Lund. They're teriffic."
4,Excellent Recipes,I originally previewed this book from the library and thought the recipes looked good. I decided that I had to have the book. I have tried some of the recipes from this cookbook and they are actually very good. I plan on preparing more of the recipes too. Of course the portions are very small but isn't that what dieting is all about - portion control. I think anybody who buys this book will agree that the recipes are very flavorable. Enjoy!!
4,Great to memorize and sing along while camping.,My youngest daughter has loved this kind of music since she was tiny because her grandpa used to sing many of these songs to her. I bought her this CD as well as the original CD. She loves them and we sometimes play the music on long drives.
3,Not bad for the price . . .,"considering how much costumes are at your local stores. Plus, we got it in time for Halloween! Bonus!!"
3,"Pleasant taste, questionable results",This tea has a delightful flavor. Lightly sweet and just lemony enough to be refreshing. I added a little bit of honey and it was like candy. Despite being scrumptious I feel no effect on the soreness of my throat. I spent time with my boyfriend over the weekend and apparently caught whatever bug he was carrying. He's been home sick with a fever and sore throat for two days and my symptoms have just started. I was hoping to head off this cold at the pass by loading up on some herbal teas (which usually does the trick) but I'm half way through my second consecutive cup with no change what-so-ever. I may just have a super bug that requires something stronger than tea but I was hoping for at least SOME improvement. Back to Halls it is!
5,Better than cough drops,"GREAT. Best thing you can drink if you have a sore throat or a cold! Even if you don't like tea, I would still recommend it."
5,Delicious throat-soother will be treasured the next time you have a sore throat!,"My whole family loves the flavor and the soothing effects of this tea when we have colds or sore throats for any reason. It's naturally a little sweet, but honey may be added for additional effectiveness, especially in a dry climate like we have in Arizona--keep plenty on hand!"
5,This stuff is MAGIC,"I have tried both this and the ""regular"" Throat Coat and although they taste differently, they are both pretty yummy. This one is, as the name suggests, a little bit lemony while the Throat Coat has more of a sweet/cinnamon flavor, but it also tastes good.I teach large college classes, which requires speaking very loudly (shouting, really) for 50-75 minutes at a time. A cup of this before class makes a HUGE difference in how my throat feels and how my voice sounds afterward. It really is amazing.I have found, however, that steeping it for 10 minutes (as the instructions say) actually ruins the flavor. I steep it for about 2-3 minutes and it works just as well or better but tastes much better!"
1,Slow and Uninspired,"This set of tapes was very disappointing. The makers of these films need to sit down with a typical middle schooler or have some experienced teachers provide them some guidance. The producers clearly do not have a grasp of what engages a teenager (adults would be bored too). In the tapes, talking heads do a lot of talking. Many sections look like a slide show with text superimposed. The background music is positively awful and the narration is monotonous. Suggestions: Use clips from CSPAN with Congressmen going after it. Use more Senators, justices and Administrative workers and let them explain what they do. Find some entertaining personality to guide the viewer through the show and interview people instead of using a narrator's voice-over. Use anecdotes. Loosen up. Have some fun. Inject some humor. I would agree that the tapes are fairly informative but if you are a teacher be forewarned: your students will lose interest very quickly."
2,Bohemian Artist,"Unlike the true frontiersmen (ie; Dick Proenneke, One Man's WIlderness or James Huntington, On The Edge of Nowhere), this man is a typical anti-establishment artist who escaped to the outdoors in search of himself. His work reveals his own state of depression. It would be interesting to know what became of his son."
3,Great suspense and police action,Suspense and police action are supreme in this New York City murder of a priest
1,boner,"The Publisher's Weekly comment that the twist at the end of this novel is not credible is understated. (Poorly written sentence, I know; but I received no huge advance for this one.) This rather mundane work is flawed. Simply put, the reader should get his/her money back on this one.I give it one star because i had to.i felt cheated."
3,B minus for that one!,"I read a few of Daley's novel and all were better than this one. The only thing I will remember from this sorry tale is of a political nature. How come that in the United State of America there is not a credible system of care for all citizens paid out of the common taxes. Father Redmond, the ultimate good guy, has to steal and create debts that he can't ever expect to reimburse all that to make sure that the love of his life can received proper treatment and care. And this is 2005 when all the civilised nations of the world have such a system. That Frank plounges to his death from some rooftop because of that may be quite over the top since it prooves a deficit in his character, and for letting the man down that way after having build him up over all those pages, we can't but be a little resentful of the author."
2,meandering red herrings,"Great premise, a roaring start with vibrant people and believable conflict. Within fifty pages the story starts wandering and lumbering about like a three legged rhino in the dark. By the middle of the book several story lines are introduced and abandoned. By the end of the book the characters are abandoned as well.How could a great storyteller like Daley write such a mess?Where was any editor?Why did Penzler (a master of impeccable judgement) publish this??"
1,Metaphysical - Is this something you look for?,"I am teaching Typology, such as Enneagram, Myers Briggs & DiSC. I am expecting to get inspiration with some interesting graphics or pictures for my teaching. So I ordered this book from Amazon. Upon receiving this book, I flip through it eagerly, only to find that it fills up with metaphysical stuff, like water, air, fire & earth etc. I cannot find a single page of practicality. It is even remotely linked to MBTI. I give 1 star on the practical side of it. ..."
3,Good for the Mills Bros. Fan,"These recordings are good for the Mills Bros. Fans. However if you're new to the Mills, then this is probably not the best album to start with. The quality of the recordings is a bit questionable, probably early, and remastering hasn't pefected them. But each song is a classic and representative of the Bros. Definitely worth a listen, but there are better places to start. Try 22 Greatest Hits, or Command Performance for some great recording."
2,Average,"Although thoroughly lacking credibility, these four wannabe crust punx play a satisfying blend of grind, hardcore, crust, straight up So Cal punk with a tinge of streetpunk/oi. The two token female members add diversity yet lack talent. Although from a different background, I would be most inclined to describe their sound as Disrupt meets Aus Rotten with some Total Chaos thrown in for good measure. A solid first album which the band will hopefully build upon. (Pity about their website)."
2,Hmmmmmmmmm,"I bought this cd on the basis of their song on the ""give 'em the boot 2"" sampler. The 20 tracks are misleading because the cd's total length is only about 15 mins. The best songs on the album are the ones with vocals by jen. All the rest are pretty bland."
5,Good Information for Beginners,"If (like me) you were raised in a white-collar neighborhood, by a dad who didn't know his way around a home shop, this DVD will be very helpful. It will give you a basic idea of what each machine does, and it's not boring."
1,DID NOT WORK,"WE ORDERED THIS DVD AND IT DID NOT WORK WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS RECORDED ON 2 TRACKS. THEN WE WERE TOLD THAT WE COULD PURCHASE CORDS ETC FROM RADIO SHACK TO MAKE IT WORK WHEN I COMPLAINED, WAS TOLD TO RETURN IT FOR REFUND.... THIS INFO SHOULD BE ON THE ITEM BEFORE PURCHASE. ENDS UP WE STILL HAVE THE THING, A REAL DEAL"
2,"Interesting characters, but dull writing","I hate to give this book only 2 stars, because I thought the characters were so interesting. In particular, the little girl who is the main character was very intruiging. I really wanted to find out what was going to happen to her next as the book unfolded. Unfortunately, I had to slog through some pretty dull stuff! I appreciated the author's attempt to describe a very important time in Irish history, but the chapters on the historical stuff were not intertwined well with the rest of the plot. It was as if you got a taste of a good story, then all the sudden you had to tramp through a chapter of ""Irish History 101."" Very clunky.Can't recommend buying this book. If you are still curious to read it, I suggest checking it out at the library. (If this were a movie, I'd say ""wait for the video."")"
1,HORRIBLE.,The charger I received doesn't even work no matter how I set the cord for it. I am very unhappy about it but it was only $3.00 I lost so it's not that big of a deal for me to go through sending it back or getting a refund. HORRIBLE.
5,Perfect purchase,The charger arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Works perfectly and the price was only 10% of what I would have spent at a Verizon store!
3,The wire is way too short.,"the wire is probably only 18"". it feels like you have a leash on if you want to talk on the phone as it charges; can't get far from the wall at all. other than that it works great."
1,cell phone charger,"The only reason you see a rating of one star is because the program will not accept a review with zero stars, or even negative stars. The first charger that I received was DOA. Did not work at all. They sent me a second charger that worked once, overnight, and it, too, failed. I paid $6.00 inluding shipping, but I was credited with only $4.82 Bad experience. I'm told that these chargers may not have the necessary interface that's needed to be functional."
3,Somewhat working,"I ordered 3 chargers from this place, and one of them was shot....and didn't work. either it was for a completely different model or just busted...2 of them work fine tho..."
1,Don't buy IO Magic drives,The lightscribe portion of the product DOES NOT WORK. I waisted a week back and forth with customer service. I bought an HP lightscribe drive and it worked perfectly the first time.
4,Smells better than the real thing!,"I originally bought this video for my home theater and it looked really cool on the 84"" screen! Then we got a new boat with a built in flat screen DVD so the DVD actually makes people do a double take. Definately a fun video to play during a cocktail party on the boat!! My neighbor coveted it so much I am buying her one too!"
4,lay-z-boy tranquillity,"On sundays my husband goes into his room to watch football, I cannot change the station. So I view this video. I relax and my husband lives!"
1,Only good for underwater,"The waterproof aspect was very appealing when I purchased this camera. I was thinking that if I could get a good point and shoot that also took underwater shots that would kill two birds with one stone. Of the approximately 100 pictures I've taken, only about 95 of them have been poor picture quality with horrible color. Pentax's customer support was no help either, I'm sending the camera back to the store. I can see a very distinct difference in picture quality and clarity between this 7 megapixel Pentax and my 4 year old 5 megapixel Sony P10. Even with the naked eye (zooming in seals the deal), the Pentax loses every time.The underwater feature is pretty cool and its underwater pictures turn out okay, but I can't justify keeping this camera where I'll only use it underwater very irregularly."
2,Don't Bother,I bought this camera because the earlier W10 model that 2 of my family members own shoots fantastic quality picures. This one on the other hand has terrible quality pictures that are tinted with a green hue. I have attempted to try reset the settings but to no avail. This camera sucks and I am stuck with it because amazon has a terrible return policy. I will never buy electronics here again!
4,Pretty good,I got into the whole fantasy world with Lord of the Rings and since then I have been looking for books with and alternate world theme. I bought the whole set at one go and must say I have enjoyed it so far. It is well written and I really like the story line.
1,Drab and confusing.,"I saw a bit of the tv series and bought the trilogy as the book is almost always better and more detailed. The book dribbled along with not making much sense, dark and dreary throughout, with no feeling of triumph in the resolution. If I want to be depressed, I can watch the evening news."
5,Pretty and fuctional,"I love this sushi set. I bought it for my husband last year, and it is every thing I hoped. We use it very often and have had no problems. The only thing we don't use are the placemats."
4,Good reference for advanced studies,Excellent review of fundamental laminar and turbulent mass transfer. Parts of the book are not suited for undergraduate study.
1,"Had he gone so far, as to actually not act so mean.",This book is stuck in an archaic age. Get something more relevant
1,Sounds like the author reviewed this himself,"I am pretty sure that the author sent the only positive review. That is pretty pathetic. This book was written with no rhyme or reason. There is no good progression of information or understandable sense to it all. One star is stretch. Plus, i am asian, and it was still hard for me-that is when you know it is bad."
2,a feeble attempt to cash in on another fad,"I couldn't get very excited about this book. The whole genre of ""pricing guides"" is tacky and depressing (it takes all the fun out of junking - both from a buying and selling standpoint) but this one didn't even try to be informative. It wasn't well researched, nor was it very comprehensive.I would suggest ignoring these guides and just going with your instinct. If you like it, buy it. Don't let these silly guides decide your taste for you. If you're a dealer, get to know your stuff and your customers and price accordingly."
1,zero value,This manual is best suited for recycling container. it is completely useless in today's environment. I lost money but you don't have to.
4,Unusual and Unusually Good,"Researching the overall 1890's culture has been a pretty lackluster endeavor -- books have been mostly political (The Reckless Decade) or Astor-Society centric (a Season of Splendor), but this book is not. Indeed it is hard to find the center of this book, as it were. It's style is certainly impressionistic, it is certainly detailed, it is certainly literary, it is certainly written by a writer not interested in being popular, and it must be said that sometimes it is certainly easy to occasionally lose Beer's direction or understand exactly what/who he is writing about. Still, it is wonderfully well-written, and actually fun to read, if you go with the flow -- which is sometimes, it seems, at cross currents. I really liked this book, almost loved it, but I can't guarantee you will."
1,huh? witty anecdotes?,"Is it possible that this paperback published in 1997 is a completely different book than the one I just took out of my local library? *That* book was also called ""The Mauve Decade"" and was also by Thomas Beer, but it was originally published in 1926 and might as well be written in a foreign tongue, for all its incomprehensibility to my modern mind. It's not that the language didn't make sense: yep, subjects, predicates, familiar words in English... But overall, the book was written in some abstract style that I just didn't ""get"" at all. I am terribly interested in this historical period, and I was looking forward to reading this book full of witty anecdotes. Sigh. Good thing I took it out of the library, because had I purchased it, I would have felt ripped off."
1,Hood Rats,Zero Stars!!! The Director & Studio Exec who made this movie should be shot. This movie is the absolute worst movie I ever saw. This movie is a disgrace to the Hispanic Race. Even Gang Bangers should be ashamed!!!!!!
1,waste waste waste,"I just watched this movie with my 14 year old son thinking it would be about young gangster life and it was the most boring dumbest movie we ever seen. Shot on a $1.52 budget It was shot on about 6 takes meaning each scene was a continuous shot, camera moving back and forth and around players in the movie(these r not actors) Each scene could have been tied up in about 45 seconds but instead dragged out for about 20 minutes of circular B.S.ing. My son and I would look at each other and laugh at just how lame and this was. The highlight to us was in the scene where the 2 main players are parting with the girls, they are jacked by two other guys looking for this ""package"" One of them has a gun and knife in each hand. He fumbels and juggles the knife and finally puts it down, since it was about 15 minuets into a continuous shot, he almost blew it.All in all there is no story, no action, just a waste of $5.00THIS MOVIE WOULD BE PERFECT FOR SOMEONE WITH INSOMNIA"
1,horrible movie!!!!!,"I like to first start off that I'm Latino and love Latino cinema and movies about Latino urban life such as Blood in, Blood out. I enjoy many movies and a very easy critic. This movie is horrible. Very low budget. I think the film crew had about 2 cameras. I took two years of film making in high school and if I had there equipment, with thier so-so actors, I can make a better movie than this. There's one scene were the two guys and two girls are talking and all the camera man does is rotate around them!!! No close ups, MDs, no mixing anything up. This combined with lame dialog, and sterotypical Californian Mexican acting. The director and producer have Latino last names and they potrayed our people really bad. And what's up with the title??? Just by reading the title ""Hood Rats"" and looking at the cover I thought it was about Latina gang-bangers or bust downs in the hood. None what so ever!!! LAME!"
1,"Sorry Edgar, bad move","Si alguna vez lees esto Edgar, tu amigo Marco A. del colegio en Ecuador te pide que hagas algo mas fidedigno, no he visto la pelicula pero las criticas lo dicen mucho.Maybe next time you'll have your own revenge with yourself buddy, poor try, but I repeat again, next time bro just for this cause."
1,BE CAREFUL! THIS IS NOT TAYLOR HICKS' CD,"If you are expecting the soulful man you saw through the American Idol season five then DON'T BUY THIS CD. Unfortunately has the same name that Taylor's 2005 CD ""under the radar"" but THIS CD ISN'T HIS. His 2005 release ""under the radar"" is very soulful, sexy and he performances with his band and all the songs are written by him, but unfortunately had a limited print and you can only get it through ebay or local shops in Birmingham, AL.DON'T BE FOOL BY THE NAME OF THIS CD. THIS IS NOT TAYLOR HICKS' CD"
5,exactly,"I must agree completely with the previous statements. This CD is absolutely amazing. It has found a perminent home in my car's cd changer. This recording has everything I've ever looked for (well, with the exception of some female vocals... maybe next time around? get some female back-ups maybe? )."
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars,I too felt that amazon misrepresented this CD. I did a search for Taylor Hicks and this is what came up. I didn't feel that I had to search anymore it was the only thing that came up. I do not like this music at all! Not to mention I waited over a month for the CD and was seriously disappointment! I warn other buyers out there to look for Taylor Hicks CD's elsewhere.
1,NOT TAYLOR HICKS,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR TAYLOR'S CD YOU NEED TO GO TO THEWEBSITE FOR LASER'S EDGE TO PURCHASE.*****THIS IS NOT HIS CD, NOT EVEN CLOSE ***"
2,disappointed!,I bought this DVD and a few more of the Animal Atlas- I was extremely disappointed the there is so much evolution teaching! These are videos for little kids to learn about animals not evolution!!!!!!! I agree with the other parent- it was disappointing all these videos are filmed at a zoo or animal park. Also the same video of the lion of Animal Passport is the same footage from the other Animal Atlas videos!
3,Nice item but wrong fit,Item was purchased for a 2003 Subaru Baja but did not work for it as packaged. Cut off end & rewired to make it work
5,"Over the Rhine: Cincinnati's ""best kept secret""","I am a big fan of many artists on this disc. Great tracks are included here by McLachlan, Gabriel, McKennitt, UB40, and several others. But my favorite artist without a doubt is Over the Rhine. I have been listening to this group for 6-7 years now, and they are finally getting exposure through projects like this. If you enjoy female-fronted acts like Innocence Mission, Cowboy Junkies, 10,000 Maniacs (or solo artists like Sarah McLachlan, even), then this band would meet your fancy. Check out some of their projects to see just how many people are in love with this band."
3,Journeys,I think this is a very relaxing Cd. There is nothing that is too heavy or loud. I would definately reccomend it to anyone. It is a great CD to unwind to.
5,Glad I gave it a shot.,I didn't know what to think when I first bought this book but something in the description really intrigued me......and I'm really glad I did. It was a good read. I'll read more from this author in the future.
3,My Review of Mystery Walk,"Robert R. McCammon does a fine job at making the reader feel for the characters, Romona and Billy Creekmore. The realization of prejudice in the 1960's and today is brought out in Mystery Walk. The suspense and in depth storyline make the reader to want to keep reading and to not want to put the book down. McCammon gives a unique personality to each of his characters. There are characters that you will follow, and those that you will hate. The descriptions are so thorough that the reader will feel as if they know the characters. This book will be good for readers who like horror and mystery stories. It twists horror and mystery together to create a story of suspense and a tale of hardship of a woman and her son through life. Mystery Walk deals with the battles between life and death, God and evil, and the people that life has chosen to be the go-betweens."
2,Mystery walk,"I'm reading this book on my iPad and it seems pretty good so far. However, has this publisher never heard of spellcheck?!! Seriously, someone has run a spell check and replace the word ""die ""with the word ""the."" The typos are a amazing."
5,Mystery Walk,"I love everything by Robert McCammon, and this book is no different. I recently downloaded all 10 of the newly posted McCammon books on Amazon for the Kindle. Two down and 8 to go."
1,Not as described,Book arrived today but was a hardback not the mass market paperback as described. I have arthritis in my hands and it is difficult to hold hardbacks so I was disappointed that they sent the wrong thing.
2,wish it was better,Dream Academy was a masterpiece...don't know why things digressed...I'll still give this writer another chance though--as his original stuff was amazing.
3,Not nearly as good as the book,"I admit that I'm a Nanowrimo, National Novel Writing Month, convert. I love the idea of writing a novel in thirty days, and I've made some great writer friends through my involvement with Nano. I read Chris Baty's book, No Plot, No Problem, which is where this kit originates, so I thought I'd give the kit a try. This kit is only useful to people who are new to the Nanowrimo process, and I honestly believe that the book does a better job of promoting Nano as well as encouraging each of us in finding that writer within."
1,Someone should've said NO to drugs!,I'm not sure who was more out of their mind-the author or the publisher on this! The sad thing is that I bought this and therefore I am the only one to blame for the time I wasted reading it. Time is as valuable as money-don't waste it reading this book. Money comes & goes but time you can't get back. I did manage to find one good use for it-it will serve as an excellent source of heat this next winter in our fireplace.
2,No Book? Big problem.,"This is more ""gimmick"" than substance. Ironically, it's supposedly about generating substance, but it's basically a pep-talk and/or motivational kit replete with cute little ""flare"" and ""swag"" like badges that read ""ask me about my novel."" This could very well be useful and inspiring or even guiding to some people. To me, it's a bit like a motivational introduction to a multi-level marketing business...the business being your novel. And hey, if that fires you up, great! I expected a book of some substance with some real direction. If this were a kit on sky-diving, I suspect it would be called ""No Chute, No Problem"" and the kit's instructions would boil down to a flyer that reads ""JUMP!"" (granted...getting started on anything is 90% the battle...but a plan will be needed at some point...and that time is preferably before you leave the plane!)"
3,not my style,I realize that I do not need these various motivational cards etc. I was thinking that it would give me greater information as tohow to use the related website.
4,"Enlightening, but not too exciting","The book is often repetitive, but it gives a great overview of the history of Puerto Rico written circa 1900, shortly after it was ceded to the United States by Spain. The history is colored with what might be considered racism, but they really were just the prevailing attitudes of society as a whole when this book was written. I found it a little quaint and not offensive at all, but your mileage may vary.I learned a great deal from this book, and it provided a great short read prior to my first trip to Puerto Rico. I was able to appreciate the culture and the history of the island much more after reading this account."
2,Shorter than the description claims,"I carefully measured my tripod and ball head before ordering this bag. They measured 31 long, so the bag was supposed to be 31 1/2 inches. Well the bag is a little short! Yeah I can get it in there but not like the fit should be. A real strain on the zipper and you cannot stand the bag up like you should be able to."
2,Product Description is NOT accurate!,"I 'm very disappointed on the description of the product.The product was described 31.5"" or 80cm in length, but when I measured it, it shows 70cm in length. What a misleading product description!!Won't buy the bag from this brand ever again!!"
4,bangin rare wu cd a must 4 any hardcore headz,"very rare, very excentric, a must for anyone who calls themself a wu fan completes my collection of everything wu"
3,Hardcore fans gotta get it!,"The album was good, the songs I found on repeat were Pt2 of U don't know and Brooklyn Zoo Remix. I didn't give it 5 stars because none of the beats really grabbed my attention. I was expecting a really grimy, hardcore, raw,stripped to the bone beat, that had an old distorted sampling feel to it with that undergoung Ny feel."
5,"Paris may be sleeping, but this album will wake you!","The Deal: 13 house tracks put together under the guise of the weekly Parisian club night of the same name. It happens ""tous les mercredis"" (every wednesday) since 1996 at the self proclaimed most prestigious club in Paris, Queen. Tracks you'll recognize by beat, if not by name include HEAR THE MUSIC, by Paul Johnson. Classic! If you've ever been to the club Body & Soul in NYC, a song that DJ and remixer Francois K played for a while is a tune he remixed, TOUT ES BLEU by Ame Strong. Beautiful house music! Another house gem that's guaranteed to move any big room is the instrumental hit, FAITHFUL by Fantom. Respect end this compilation with a classic house anthem, Adeva's RESPECT.

4,Break Dancer Stuff,"HI Im a Break DAncer and ive listened to this CD. Its really funky. Fantom with FAithful is a really cool song. I love to break dance to it and the rest is really great. Im an Xtreme Techno/House fan and I love this CD. Even if you dont break dance its cool any way and its impossible not to dance to at least one song on here. Well Buckwheat440, me gives it a 4 star review. Its a little repetitive, but its great."
5,Amazing work,"What talent James Robinson displays in all of his work. From art to music, poetry to anthropology, his capability is profound. I miss you Dad."
5,the settlers,I live close to where they settled. Loved the book and the history of them because I am also a decendant of the swedish emmigrants.
5,The New Yorker of the Fantasy/SciFi Genre,"What sets F&SF Mag apart from the other digest-sized magazines that deliver speculative fiction is that F&SF chooses, almost every month, to transcend the genres it represents instead of remaining within the definitions and boxes that limit the other magazines. There don't seem to be any hard and fast rules concerning the stories that appear in this magazine except that they be really well written, and compellingly readable. The stories run all over the fertile woodland of Fantasy and Science Fiction and every month hold many surprises. There really hasn't been a magazine this satisfying since the old Twilight Zone magazine. In the end, it isn't about hard science or speculation about what might happen (in a scientific way). This is a magazine about stories for people who love to read them."
4,The Best Digest for Fantasy,"With its cheap pricetag and thick size, Fantasy & Science Fiction is definately one of the best. It splits it pages into fantasy & science fiction stories and novellas with a few common columns between (book reviews and strange facts). If you write fantasy or science fiction, pick magazine up."
2,"Great plots, bad terminology","In five sleepless nights I read this book, but not because it was gripping. Actually, on Page 43, when Kernan says, ""Some writers, concerned about shooting their wad too early..."" I woke up. My God, had I received an X-rated book by mistake? No, I realized, a few chapters later, just another of Kernan's incredibly misplaced and misstated metaphors. If a guy can't get his language straight, how much of his plot-building advice should I take? Not much, I decided."
1,Poor imitation,"This cologne is not the real thing; but seems to be a poor imitation. I bought it again from Neiman Marcus, and the difference is amazing. I would not recommend it to a friend."
3,Just OK,It's a very old book with a lot of very good recipient that have to be modified to our evolving healthy lifestyles. Baking instead of frying or using extra virgin olive oil over lard are some examples.
1,The truth is horrific enough without adding FICTION....,"Most of the facts presented are false...too many to mention...another one star reviewer did a pretty good job of listing.A most heartbreaking situation made moreso by myths.If you want to see the 'monster' so-called Priest being interviewed as well as the victims mostly edited, that would be about the only reason to purchase.All other aspects of the documentary have no factual basis and actually come down to B.S.Presenting the Truth would have sufficed as tragedy enough.Lord have Mercy on us."
1,"Creepy, way too harsh: not for the softer at heart.","I believe this documentary was a well made one. I think the story boarding, taking both sides of the story into account and truley trying to expose this grim situation was done as best as possible.Just the content. Wow. I guess there are some things you dont want to delve to deep into (considering im not even catholic or a christian for that matter) this issue thats been going on for hundreds of years.I just had to turn it off towards the end, i found the more I watched it and saw how this abuse tore these people apart the less I wanted to keep watching it.Powerful. Torture to watch (for me.) not for the light hearted."
5,Compulsive viewing,"This video can receive no better validation than the fact the deviants of the Catholic Church have done everything in their power to try and suppress it. Anyone, whether catholic or not, whose children might have even a remote possibility of contact with a catholic priest should see this. The events described are only the tip of the iceberg but demonstrate the underhanded and insidious way the Vatican operates to cover up child rape and torture. The Catholic Church is a truly sick and repressive organisation which should be banned on child protection grounds."
4,Delivered,Evil is a perception but the perceptions shown in this documentary should concern every person that cares about the vulnerable. The arrogance and ignorance of the organized religious are well documented here. Anyone who doesn't yet understand the trappings of an 'organized' religion should WAKE UP to it. Thie film does a good job of it.
4,Priests Should Marry,"This movie banned in Singapore and DVD not allowed because of its truthful exposure of pedaphelia by Catholic priests. My mother was catholic but I never received parochrial training and stopped going to church at age 10, and so escaped what might have happed to me.Oliver O'Grady is a monster should should be in Jail for life. Cardinal Mahoney should be in Jail too.If you are Catholic and have children, watch this DVD or keep your kids away from priests unless you are present at all times.I am glad this fildm was shown in Australia where I watched it.Bill"
4,Gaaahh!!!!!,"I watched this documentary years ago and rewatched it for the second time today. I am horrified....just horrified at how this priest, Father O'Grady was able to molest young children. Sick and evil!!"
4,Appreciation...,"Just a note to the previous reviewer... *all* appreciation is in the mind, not 'in the sound'. The sound is heard in the mind. That said, some will appreciate this stuff and some will not. In my opinion, the music isn't even important... the Moog (and the artists who created and played these sounds) are the stars of the show. Listening to this music is like watching a (pretty bad) movie starring a great actor... In my opinion, the unique and magical sound of the Moog (when played by people who know what they're doing) can redeem the worst, cheesiest song and make it into a masterpiece.If you like that unique analog Moog sound, you'll probably like this -- it's that simple. But please, don't buy it mainly for the music -- likely you'll be disappointed. If you buy it because you love the sound of the Moog, you're sure to be rewarded."
3,This is Some Funky Moog,"Disinformation is so strikingly different and somewhat psychedelic, it's hard to do anything but laugh when you first listen. Takes awhile to get used to, but then the electronic sounds carry you away..."
4,Entertaining,"Mr. Mitchum's book is entertaining, hence the title. It's hard to get into the plot but it is a book yuo read if not just to find out the ending. I would suggest this to older readers. Not because of words or suggestion but because they probably are more able to understand."
4,HOT FIREPLACE,"Mesmerizing! When I first put the video on and the flames roared big and bright, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. It felt like the real thing. And it was beautiful. Rich flame colors and the beautiful brick background. It turned my TV into a fireplace and my friends and I enjoyed it very much. We got a laugh when a hand with a poker came in to adjust the logs. We would have given it five stars if it was longer. That was our only complaint. It burns for only an hour. But that hour is great. We've seen other fireplaces on video and think this is the best looking."
4,Use this for my fireplace,A tv with a built in vcr that loops. Problem is that the old tape (1986?) wears with time and EM field dissipates. And often needing to clean vcr write heads. But great for the fake fireplace.
4,Video Fireplace,"The tape arrived at the house very quickly after ordering and was in great condition. It is a very nice way to have a crackling fireplace without really having one - good for the environment. However, it is only 60 minutes in length - too short and have to rewind it."
3,Hear Me from a-far (pun intended),"...An excellent way to not warm your hands. This one has someone tending to the fire, so omit use of fireplace tools; if you do use them, be care you don't crack the screen....Some folks may want to build up a fake fireplace around this, which will require putting it around your TV set or Laptop computer. Of course, you could put it inside your real fireplace, also....I don't know where one can purchase fake smoke or ashes....No narration on this video; but then, what would you say about a fire for 1 1/2 - 3 hours?...Some of these videos have music; others get rather boring, because they show a pair of glasses or a book for several minutes."
2,Poorly edited,"Whoever edited this book should be fired. It seems like every other page the text accidentally a word, or contains a subject-verb disagreement, or simply includes a sentence so badly written that it takes 3 tries to comprehend. Hell, you can see it on page 2 in Amazon's ""Look Inside"" preview! ""Drug delivery, e.g., putting drug inside carbon nanotubes...""It is a mystery and a marvel that this book made it to publication in its current state."
2,Stopped working after 10 minutes,"My daughter received the Tracing Table as a gift for her birthday. We inserted 4 new AA batteries and she began to trace. After 10 minutes the small light that enables the tracing went out. Just to make sure, we put in 4 new batteries, but the table would still not light up. Now the toy is totally useless until I make a special trip to hunt down the small bulb required for the toy. Another odd note: this table has the name ""Fashion Tracing Table"", not ""Funky Fashion Tracing Desk"". But I can tell from the photo that it is the same product."
1,Bulb Doesn't Work,"ALTHOUGH THIS TOY IS FUN AND HAS EDUCATIONAL VALUE, IT DOESN'T WORK CORRECTLY. LIGHT BULB DOES NOT STAY LIT. THE LIGHT BURNED OUT AFTER PLAYING WITH IT FOR A FEW MINUTES."
4,Love this toy,"My daughter received this for her birthday. She got it out and sat for along time drawing and coloring. Loves this toy. We did find that the light started to go out so we replaced the batteries it is not the batteries. The connection points that touch the batteries were the problem. One of the connection points was not even touching the battery I took a screw driver and bent it slightly so it would touch the battery, now it works great. As for the paper you can cut your own paper, just use printer paper and size it by using one of the papers that the toy originally came with. We made lots of extra paper to use. We also added some extra color pencils so she would have more of a variety. Good toy with a little adjusting."
3,Not terrible but not great either,"Trouble first emerged in the mid 80's on the heavy metal scene and turned into a great metal band. Psalm 9 and The Skull are great metal albums, among others but this one lacks the constant punch of some of Trouble's better albums. There's only three or four tracks that i really like on Plastic green Head. The title track is excellent along with Below me and Long Shadows Fall and possibly one other track are the only ones that I like. Still it's worth getting for only those tracks as they carry the album. Trouble's been a great Metal band since they first began but this album is only average with some good material and some forgettable material."
5,Buttock-kicker!!!,"I'm not sure why this cd is not as popular as Psalm 9. I love this album. It has the right ingredients of melodic catchiness (Opium-eater, Hear the Earth) to ""black sabbath"" style doom and gloom (Plastic Green Head) to keep any die-hard metal fan satiated. Very underrated are this band and this album for that matter. I've had it for a couple of weeks and probably have listened to it about 50 times!!! Buy this cd if you like Black Sabbath. You won't regret it. P.S. I'm excited about Kory Clarke singing for the ""new"" trouble. I will however miss the musical stylings of Eric Wagner. Long live Trouble!"
4,Boys Baseball Mitt,Quality product and great value for the price. Third Mizuno glove my son has owned and he loves them all.
3,Becoming Human,"Worth reading, short novel. The author is a man to be admired, and I consider this book to be an eye opener. We all need to rethink our own growth in spiritual life as well as human life, this book helps with the process. Take an afternoon and read this fine book, you will have something to think about."
2,Franklin's Valentines,"This DVD is something of a disapointment because it only has 3 Franklin stories on it and one of them is Franklin and the Tooth Fairy, which we already have on 3 other DVDs! The other Franklin bonus story is Franklin Takes a Trip, which is an OK story. The 4th ""bonus story"" is really a Rolie Polie Olie story. Who wants that when they've ordered a DVD of Franklin?"
5,Good Story,"During my 8th grade year, my english class read The Outsiders well after that I saw the movie it's good. A year later 2001 I decided to get the audiobook That Was Then, This Is Now it was a good book I couldn't stop listening to it, this was a interesting so if you liked, The Outsiders read this."
5,My opinion,"I think this book was a fantastic book. It shows the chanllenges you have to fear while you are growing up! IT shows how you should and should not deal with issues that you have to face in everyday life.This book is about two best-frinds that are basically brothers. They live together and do everything together. When one of the boys is ready to grow up the other still wants to be a kid. They begin to grow apart when Bryon gets a girlfriend and he starts spending most of his time with her. Mark wants to know what has happened and why they fo not do the same stuff anymore and the only response he gets is ""That was then this is now"". As they grow apart they have to face many challenges on their own. WHich they have to do by themselves instead of their best-freind to be ther to help them."
4,"Excellent, but Very Sad","This book is very, very well writen. It really gets you interested in what happens in each characters life. The book however really made me sad. It's very depressing. I recomend it to anyone who can handle sad books."
4,I thought that it was ok!,"I thought it was ok, I would read it again because I liked it and it was interesting. I thing that it was a little unspecific in some parts, but I liked it alright. I would advise people to read it because it was good. Thank-u!!!"
4,It was sad and emotional.,"This story was sad and very wordy. It put effects on you and made you think a little harder than usall. whaile seeing Bryon face horrible momments and loving ones like Cathy, was spirituall to me. esspetioally when he threw mark in jail. I don't think he should of done that. but now I am just saying What if. that is what the story is saying to me. Don't say what if."
5,a beutiful story about the growing apart of of best friends,"at first i thought this book was too sad ,but i now realize that the truth must be sad . i really liked seeing world through bryons eyes espeically how he viewed mark."
3,Not a bad read but this is where Hinton Jumped the Shark,"You have a lot of the recurring themes in her other stuff in this, young people faced with hardships, at a crossroads in their life and how they deal with change and loss of innocence. I am a fan of S.E Hintons books but this would have to be the one where she jumped the shark. There was a lot I liked about this book but this was the first one where I actually felt like I was reading a ""teen"" book. I really could have done without all the corny straight out of an old episode of Dragnet portrayals of hippies and drug use. Overall not a bad read but just not on the level of The Outsiders or Rumble Fish."
4,Life is Filled With Tough Decisions,"Have you ever known someone was doing something wrong but you loved them too much to do anything about it? That is the idea behind That Was Then, This is Now by S.E. Hinton. Mark has lived with Bryon and his mother for five years. They have been best friends for as long as either one can remember. They are having a hard time making money and Mark and Bryon both have to get jobs. When someone needs money there's no telling how far they will go to get it.I would give this book four stars because I really liked it. I liked it because it really touches on some of the tougher decisions in life. This book is realistic fiction. The characters are very well developed and so is the plot. The author is very descriptive and interesting. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for more. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good intense but dramatic book. S.E. Hinton doesn't fail to amaze me with another great book.-S.S."
3,Good Job,"S.E. Hinton wrote this book at the age of sixteen I believe and she did a very well job. Though some words were used often. This book never bored me. Mark was my favorite charcter because of his wildness, but as well Bryon was a quite, tough guy who has to much things on his mind. The book is never confusing. This book is in Bryon's point of view, but I think it would be better in Mark's. I don't know about reading the others, but this book is my favorite one of S.E Hinton's collection."
3,The book was good,"I like the book ""That Was Then, This Is Now"" because it was a good book.Some of the things that I like about it was the fighting, like when the Shepard gang kept beating up M+M. One of the things that I disliked about the book is when Charlie got shot in the eye. I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,Why do educators make their students read THIS?,"This book is more of a middle aged teacher's way of having their students/kids realize what they supposedly went through decades ago. Character's were way too vulgar, and the monolouge was full of slang so outdated that it was difficult to grasp what they were speaking of or describing.Teachers may enjoy this reminiscent into their past, but I as a kid growing up in this different society didn't quite understand why those were called the ""good old days""."
2,This book is interesting but is inverted at the end.,"This book is very interesting , it kept me turning the pages. Yet at the end the whole idea the author had painted for us about Bryon is totally inverted. This makes me think that the author became tired of writing this story and decided to give it a quick-fix ending. I beleive that he took much more time and care in writng The Outsiders."
1,Very oldfashioned,"Personaly I don't usualy read these kinds of books, I'm more into modern storys, and very sad ones, I know this one is pretty sad, but still! This book is well written though. I am reading it because we are doing it as a book report."
1,Grade-school Level Literature,"Oh man...is there something wrong with me if I find this book too simple for a 6th grader like I? My teachers are nuts or what? First and foremost I would like to say this book has to be one of the most unrealistic and childish book I have ever come across. Needless to say, it's a simple book for simple minds. Delenquints or future delenquints will find this book cute."
1,drivel,"This embodies all that is wrong in literature these days.Trite and boring, and in no way resembles childhood.Make this book go away.Have children expand their minds reading quality, instead of the ""latest"" acclaimed author."
1,still didnt get my item,"so i ordered this book exactly one month ago today. i still havent receieved it! i had the standard ground shipping, but i mean come on? 1 MONTH!! give me a break. $3.99 for shipping and it wasnt even shipped a month later!! ummm hello? i ordered the book because i want to read it! not wait a year for it to get here!"
3,Erica's Review,"I enjoyed this book because of how everything about the character changes and because of these changes his life and relationships change.Byron and Mark have been as close as brothers ever since Byron's mother took Mark in. As kids Mark and Byron always did things that were way beyond what any normal kid was doing, like smoking at the age of 12! As Byron grew older though his perception changed, which probably had something to do with Cathy. Unfortunately, Mark hasn't changed a bit and still has a crazy soul. As he's grown older his decisions have grown worse. As a result, the two of them are growing apart.This book is great for any teen because of how it has so many of the issues that they go through everyday, even though some of the issues have been extremely dramatized."
3,"That was Then, This is Now","I think the book made a good point of what teenagers went through in the 1960s. Back then, lots of teens my age were getting into fighting, using drugs and trying alcohol. Some spent time in jail. My favorite part of the book was learning about The Ribbon, because there were lots of fastfood places with different kinds of foods.My two favorite characters were Bryon and Mark. I liked it when Bryon went on a date with Cathy. He showed he could love someone other than himself. Mark treated Bryon like a brother; he was loyal and wanted to protect Bryon.This book has an important message for teens. It reminds us that if you choose to get in trouble, you will pay the consequences, like getting addicted to drugs, getting beaten up or even winding up in jail."
5,"This book,","I remember the feeling I had when reading this book. It was brimming with this isolation, the kind of isolation one can still feel when surrounded by people close to your heart. We all have friends that pull apart from us after a time. This book is unique in that the main character gives up on his friend, and in turn makes his friend hate him. Most of us who have drifted away from friends cannot say the same thing to such an extreme degree, but it still doesn't account for why we don't call them, why we don't try and get a hold of them, or see them, or ask how they are. All in all a very sound read. I love all of S.E. Hinton's books, but I believe this is my second favorite right behind Rumble Fish. This is definately the saddest of her books though, that I have read as of yet."
1,Incredible Read,"This book is exciting and really attracts the adudience of teenage boys. I liked how even though this book was written and takes place in a different time period it can still fit into society today. The issues that these boys go through happen very often and the dilemas that occur can be related to, to those who grow up in families who have an uncertain financial situation.Personally i cannot relate to these characters as much because I am not growing up in the same situation. However, I can also relate to this characters because these boys are very much like me and my friends based on their thoughts and similarity in actions.One of my favorite things is how this book can fit into many different time periods. The chracters deal with drug abuse and family seperation. These awful things occur today and many people reading this book will feel sympathy for the characters. It will also give you a deeper meaning to when your parents tell you, ""Be thankful for what you have."""
2,Steer Clear,"This book was in the least bit good. It was long and uneventful. Its was too easy to read. If you ever read The Outsiders which is the book that comes before That Was Then, This Is Now you might notice the plot is bad or it does not become clear until well beyond the half way point. The whole book is about gang fighting, nosense talking and smoking. You wiil find your self being bored through out the whole book. And when you do get to the plot, its still dumb."
1,About the book,I thought the book was horibble because They are doing everything in it that teachers and parents are telling us not to do. I am 13 and I had to read that book for school.and I don't think it was to approatie
5,That was then this is now is spectacular!!!!!,This book is great. It is not afraid to take a stab at the real life of 16 year old's back then. the emotinal roller coaster then sends you spinning in your seat. A great book that kids around 10-16 should read. Just outstanding.
4,What a great book!!!,"I think thisbook was a grest book. Especially because the author put alot of stuff that would happen in modern life, such as pulling pranks like when they cut angelas hair off. I lked the idea of them using drugs because most kids would like to try something they think is cool just to look cool. I also like the parts were you just dont know what is going to happen next."
4,good book,"We were asked to pick a book and read it for english, so i chose this book. i have never read any other s.e. hinton books, but after this one i probally will move back and read the outsiders. the book was easy to read and is something all young adults can read and appreciate.the book deals with issues all kids can understand, and i think everyone knows someone like the characters in this book. once you pick it up it is fairly hard to put down.n overall ill have to give the book two thumbs up and it is definitely the best book ive read for school in a long time. thanks for reading, and enjoy."
4,This book is real good.,"What I liked about the book is that it was very well expressed like when Bryon found out that Mark was selling these drug pills. He was really shocked and mad when he found out. He felt like he lost his best friend, his only brother. But what I didn't like about the book was that they put you in a real tough position. You seem like you got to choose between your best friend or your girlfriend, but at the end it will turn out bad anyways. I thought that this book was really good. This book(to me) seemed to be better than the Outsiders. They seem to have dramatic and action scenes up in it. They had a lot of choices they make. They also get into a lot of fights, not a lot but enough. The Outsiders seem to have a lot of action scenes only, but they do have some dramatic scenes. Yes, I would recommend this book to somebody else because I think other people might enjoy it as much as i did. This book will probably encourage other people to read more or read more S.E. Hinton books."
3,sorta good,"i thought it was an okay book. the kind you enjoy and learn lots from but i wouldn't go so far as to read it repeatedly. all in all, a very realistic book about very real problems. i think it's a good book to read as a study for high skool students."
2,"that was then, this is now",I like the story because I found how is Mark doing after his parenst and he only stel and fight holl the time and how is they have a hard time with out eny job and how they trying to find and mark only changed when Bryon tell him to go away and take his stuff with him.
2,That Was Then This is Now,"This book S.E.Hinton wrote called That Was Then This Is Now is not a very good book to read. One reason is because the characters switch around too much. The second reason is because the characters talk like the person who is reading the book is about seven or eight years of age. The third reason is because the description of the characters is poor. If I was to do a book report I wouldn't personally choose this book because of the poor description.ATTENTION!!! All exciting book readers the book That Was Then This is Now, Isn't all that exciting."
3,I think this book was interesting and enjoyable.,"What I like about the book is that my favorite character Ponyboy was in it.This book also gave me a challenge in reading on the comprehension level.I dislike the book because of the conflict between Mike and Connie.I didn't think that was right for Connie to do that to someone who tried to help her.Yes i would recommend the ""Outsiders"" and ""That was then this is now"" to anyone because these two books were very challenging and enjoyable."
4,Excellant moral book!,"Although I enjoyed The Outsiders better, I still thought this book was good. I felt it had a good overal moral: friendships change. As strange as it is, I liked how the ending wasn't happy and very conclusive. I felt that the ending couldn't have been better. After reading this book, I just really felt like I had to think about it, and I like books that do that."
5,This book is so real!!!,"I almost cried when I read this book. Bryon and Mark have been best friends ever since they can remember. But then Bryon has to make the hardest descision of his life and turn Mark into the police (knowing full well that Mark will get 5 years or more in jail). I am 13 years old and I could definitely relate to all the characters. This book will definitely turn any kid away from drug experimenting. Or at least, it will make them more aware of the potential dangers. S.E. Hinton has once again successfully portrayed teenage life on the streets. This book shows you how a close-knit relationship can be affected from the outside world. It does not come up with answers to problems, but instead helps the reader understand how and why these problems arise. This is definitely a great book and I highly reccomend you to read it"
3,An all-right book,"I didn't like this book especially. I didn't really like any of the characters (well, except for Ponyboy, but only because I liked him so much in THE OUTSIDERS). The plot is good though, one I'm sure comes up more than you'd think. The main idea of this book is there are two teenage boys, Bryon and Mark, living their lives. Bryon is trying to move on from the way he used to be, and is starting to get more serious about some things, like his girlfriend Cathy. Mark, however, still lives for the thrill of things, and seems to be trying not to grow up. The boys can both feel that something is changing between them, but they aren't sure what. Then one night, Bryon comes to a horrible realization about Mark and has to face a decision that could change their friendship forever.This is a good book. It was a page-turner, and it was very real, like S.E. Hinton always writes. The ending almost ruined it for me, though! But it was still good. 3 stars."
3,That Was Then This Is Now,"A friend of yours is killed because of your life style. Do you continue to live like that or change?Mark and Bryon are like brothers. They grow up together hustling pool and street fighting. A friend Charlie dies during a street fight, Bryon then turns his life around. Mark sells drugs and is turned in by Bryon. Mark then goes to prison. Mark and Bryon who onced loved each other hate each other in the end. The book That Was Then This Is Now is a realistic fiction story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read The Outsiders. It's a spin off of this wonderful novel. This book however, is slow moving. It has excitement, but it is slow to reaching its climax. It is a story based off of choices. It relates to everyone; we all have a choice how we choose to live our lives. I enjoyed the book, but not as well as The Outsiders."
4,"That Was Then, This is Now","This is a story about two best friends. They were Bryon and Mark. They now are sixteen and are starting to not like each other. Bryon now hates the fights that they used to have when they were little. He also hates the violence that he sees Mark doing.Bryon falls in love with a girl. The girl's name was Cathy. Cathy had a brother. Cathy's brother was known as MandM because whenever or whereever you see him he is always eating MandM's. Her brother was young and healthy.Bryon then found out that Mark was using drugs. After Bryon started having a girlfriend, Mark thought that he was losing his best friend. He then started making kids start doing drugs. He didn't like Cathy because he thought that she was the reason that Bryon was changing. He made MandM start doing drugs. You will find out what happens to MandM and the rest of them when you read the book."
2,blood meridian audio cd's,I didn't really care for this product because it skips over a lot of sentences and unless you start from the beginning you wont be able to find the place that you need to start at because it doesn't say what chapter its on. I would only recommend this to the people that have the time to sit down and listen to the whole story.
2,"Campy, repetative and grim","Not a literature classic and not even a genre classic, Blood Meridian starts out on an interesting note discussing the Kid and his origins. Unfortunately it quickly slides into repetitious descriptions of barren landscapes, burnt out villages and murdered villagers, and gory confrontations with indians.The writing isn't bad, if not a bit campy, but it just never changes. No characters develop, save The Judge - by far the best part of this book - the plot doesn't stray far from a bleak sense of nihilism. Just not an interesting book in the end. Might have made a good, atmospheric video game or painting maybe. As a book however it just doesn't really work.I'd recommend against this one unless you are a diehard western fan."
3,"Apocalypse Now, redux","The theme of this book is the necessity of violence as a purgative force, an escape valve into which humanity falls when its rationality becomes paradoxical. While the book communicates in lush and sensual prose this concept, beyond that it has no direction or content, creating a literary world that is slightly more involved than particularly vivid wallpaper. The narrative is well paced and the character symbolic, but beyond that, nothing attracts within this book. It communicates its theme, and then repeats it. While this joins other literary works, from _The Sun Also Rises_ onward, in celebrating the slow death of Western society, it's unclear that there is any triumph here or anything more than a foreboding discharge of violence."
2,poor rating,I would have rated this poor at best. Looks like someone had left it in a puddle for a while. I am ususally ok giving used books as presents but this book looked like i had found it out tin the rain somewhere.
3,"Great descriptions, but...","Actually, I'd give it 2.5 stars. I REALLY liked a lot of his descriptions of the landscape. Very good. But the violence becomes too much at times (and in some cases seems awkward and unrealistic) The characters (aside from The Judge) didn't seem to 'stand out' for me."
5,"An allegorical tale comparable to ""Moby Dick""...","A thought provoking yet entertaining read; definitely one of the best books I've ever read. McCarrthy's imagery is always vivid and often disturbing, and he has produced an epic, oddly twisted and almost mystical journey of death, redemption, and discovery for his character and the reader. I can't recommend this book enough."
4,Worth the Effort,"Great book overall. The middle 90% was pretty dense, but like the border trilogy, the last few chapters were ample reward for slogging through. My main reason for this review, though, is to warn potential readers to NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION. It's inexcusable that the second paragraph of the intro blows one of the most important developments of the book. Whoever signed off on this at Random House should consider a different vocation."
3,"Grim, bleak, depressing","While it's incredibly well written, this is an incredibly grim and bleak novel that isn't for the faint of heart. Cormac McCarthy isn't known for pulling punches. In this novel, people are about as amoral and unsympathetic as it comes. Rape, murder, scalping and more - all in the same paragraph, thank you very much. I read this for a book club book, and liked it better after talking about it with friends, but it was incredibly painful during the grueling slog through the book. I can't actually recommend this book, no matter how well written it may be."
5,Blood Meridian,"If your goal in life is to be the best writer that ever was then don't read this book. It is apt to instill a sense that no matter what you might put to paper it will never match writing like this one novel. It takes you on an imaginary road trip before there were roads, or law or much in the way of civilized behavior. If it is feel good drama you were seeking, forget it! This book kicks you in the gut and challenges you intellectually to keep up with the poetry of the wordscapes. If he would only make nice, Cormac McCarthy would sell a trillion books. But life isn't always nice and you'll thank yourself for the treat of reading this tome."
4,Frustrating but good,"When I first started this I thought I'd never be able to finish. The whole book, but especially the first few chapters, are full of sentence fragments intermingled with nearly endless run on sentences with weird punctuation, obscure words and no quotations marks. It got easier to follow as the book went on, but still the plot was occasionally confusing. Everything has been said by the other reviewers. In the end I love the old west subject matter and ""no holds barred"" depictions so much that I enjoyed it. This book is very similar in subject matter to ""In the Rogue Blood"" and that book is much easier to follow and has more character development. They are both very violent and gritty and well written. I suggest Rogue if you only want one, unless you just want to know what all the fuss is about with Blood Meridian..."
1,Worst of Cormac McCarthy,"I have read the border trilogy and The Road by Cormac McCarthy and they were excellent. I agree with another reviewer on this book, that it seemed like Cormac McCarthy wrote this with a dictionary in his lap trying to find words that he had never used before. I think he wrote this with as a vain attempt to impress people with his vocabulary. I am amazed it got past an editor in this state. Do not judge him by this book. If this was the first of his I read I would never have read his others."
1,The emperor has no clothes.,"We get it -- CM likes to pretend that he can write in 19th century old-west dialog. That's a neat trick for a couple pages, and then it becomes unbearably boring. Now wrap it in a bunch of silly metaphor (how many penis references can you fit into a chapter when describing a sunrise?), pour in unending descriptions of mundane settings and let's all agree that CM has created an all-time literary masterpiece.No. This book is garbage. There may be a story underneath the 75% of the book that's useless, boring and showy description of nothing anybody cares about, but it's not worth the effort to uncover. This book is an uninteresting chore of a read. Pretending you like it does not make you a genius literary critic."
2,Engaging language; violence is too much,"After reading the trillogy, Blood Meridian was disappointing. This book should not be recommended to all - there is no point to that much violence in one novel. McCarthy's use of imagery and the way he crafts his sentences to give the reader as sense of place, history and conflict can be compared to Joyce and Melville. However, after so much violence, it becomes pointless - violence merely for violence's sake."
3,Whats all the hype?,"After laboring through this novel I must ask whats all the hype? I think it should be placed in a horror book catagory instead of a western. It's full of creepy people and surrealisim. If I want surrelisim I'll listen to Dylan's songs from the 60's/70's. If I want horror I'll read Stephen King.As a western it is uninteresting. Full of flashy violence. As a modern literature masterpiece? No thanks, I'll take John Stienbeck, or Hemmingway.Yeah, it's well written, but not worth the hyperbole."
5,Outstanding,I shall never forget the scene of the first Apache attack on the protagonist band of mercenaries. Nor shall I forget the Judge. Chilling lyrical bloodsoaked. One of the best works of fiction I have read.
3,And then they rode on,"Made The Road seem quite cheerful. The most common words in the book were ""and then they rode on."" Interesting but brutal."
5,now what?,The problem with Blood Meridien is that after you have read it;then what do you read next? Great great book but not for non-readers.
5,Bloody Meridian is not for the squeamish,"I can not name a novel which affected me more. Narrative about mercenaries and outcasts patrolling the SW US/ Mexico borders collecting renegade Comanche scalps for money. or at least that is where it starts. The US merc's are not the only evil presence. Characters are larger than life and some seemingly supernatural. Insanely violent without redemption, interleaved with the most poetic description of landscape and then the same poetic narration of unspeakable depravity. Some familiarity of Spanish is helpful. And as always McCarthy lack of punctuation takes some getting used to. I re read passages trying to fully understand the full intention. I am totally puzzled by the epilogue and it meaning. I am beginning my third re read with anticipation and dread. Would somebody please buy McCarthy a puppy. Not for the squeamish."
4,Cormac McCarthy as Joseph Conrad,"A dusty, hard-riding, cowboy version of The Heart of Darkness. Complete with a Kurtz!"
2,Blood Meridian,The author seems to be in love with his ability to write prose. He uses a $20 dollar words where a few $5 dollar words would do. I have been picking it up and laying back down for almost a month. Hard to read. His word pictures aredistorted. Almost surreal. His voice is the voice of a man wanting to be the smartest guy in the room.
1,BBQ'd Babies?! Wha???,"If you're a fan of babies, quotation marks, and native americans, then avoid this book like the plague. On the other hand, the writing is some of the most beautiful, original and haunting I have ever discovered. This guy is not my usual genre and I wanted to toss the damn book across the room about a dozen times but the writing style was so compelling that I stayed with it. Damn McCarthy. Regarding the violence, don't be scared, I've seen way worse and this is actual art, you know what I mean? It's not gratuitous, it's not the Marquis de Sade. It is what it is."
2,What's the 'bloody' point?,"The prose is excellent, the characters very convincing, and the descriptive narrative is truly atmospheric. You really feel as though you have entered a living, breathing world in this novel. So why the hideous, quite pointles violence for scene after scene after scene? Is it just some immature impulse on the author's part to see how disgusting he can be? Is it an attempt to out-do the Bret Easton Ellises of this world? It's a shame that such an obviously talented author stoops to such repulsive imagery - the novel would have worked perfectly well without it. The concept of decency seems to have disappeared from modern American writing - apparently not even the finest luminaries are immune. I can hardly bear to say it, but if you think a work which features graphic descriptions of infants' heads being smashed open across rocks is still literature, then read it. Otherwise, there's really something lacking in someone who can publish this stuff without embarrassment."
3,book overview,This book was very discriptive of violence in the west at a time prior to the civil war inwitch there was very little law&order.Survival of man was through strength of ones self and violence.I read very little humanity of human nature in the book.could have had a better closing.I believe the book could have added a little more human kindness and a better ending.
3,Be prepared,"I bought this book because it was a part of my creative writing workshop. Other people in the class actually recommended it. I guess this is one of those books you either love (because the writing is very good), or you find very upsetting and can't finish (it is super gory, people are evil apparently just for the sake of it--there is no internal monlogue, so none of the violence is explained, justified, rationalized...)I couldn't finish reading this book even though it was a part of my class, and I never plan on opening it again, but lots of people really love McCarthy's writing style and think he presents an accurate view of the violence or grittiness of life (or something).You are warned."
3,disturbing,"There is no doubt that McCarthy is one of our best authors. His writing style is unique and memorable. Admittedly, I didn't much care for it at first, being a stickler for proper punctuation! But the short descriptive phrases definitely suit the story (and are honed to perfection in McCarthy's later book ""The Road""). His prose is nothing short of brilliant. Blood Meridian was described by critics as one of McCarthy's best works, and it is, but is too disturbing to be actually liked by the reader. It is a dark, soulless story and leaves the reader hoping that all the characters will be killed off in spectacular fashion in the end. Thus, I was disappointed."
3,Blood Meridian,"I have just finished the book that began with so much promise but left me feeling cheated. The grandeur of the described natural settings and of the prose and the 'importance' of the themes were the Faberge shell for a dessicated egg. The characters: An unbelievable sophomoric Nietzschean anti-hero main character - 'the judge'- and his protagonist,the kid, a bewildered and bewildering abortive being. The novel aspires to Faulkner and Melville but delivers a self-important catalogue of brutality, albeit in poetic prose. The brutality was lurid and pornographic - not in itself a terrible thing perhaps, but I learned nothing from the book."
2,I could not finish it. Too much horrible imagery,"I started reading Blood Meridian a few days ago. I got about 80 pages into it and stopped. I took it back to the library earlier this evening and feel relieved and happy that I did not continue reading it.There is too much horrible imagery in Blood Meridian. I don't want those images in my mind. It was very well written and the story carried me along and I was conflicted about stopping but I am glad I stopped. Too many graphic images of torture, murder, mutilation, dead babies, excrement, flies, bloody body parts, agony and so on. I don't want those images, written by a genius in creating powerfuldescriptive visual images. I don't want those images in my mind.I don't recommend the book."
2,Difficult read,This was the recommendation of another author who writes serial killer novels. I expected this to be along those lines. The author's writing was difficult to interpret and at times I had to readt the paragraph a few times to get the gist of the meaning behind it. The store is about a gang of marauders who go down to Mexico killing Indians as well as Americans and goes into detail on all the gory details of the murders including scalping. I wouldn't recommend this book. It may be an author's author but not the comman man.
1,Difficult to read,I had to read this book for my book club. It was violent and disconnected. I never finished it. He was a very descriptive writer but I had nightmares about some scenes.
3,impressive style but tedious and rambling,I wish I had read between the lines of all the rhapsodic reviews of the descriptiveness and prose style. Look elsewhere if you want such things as character or plot. I plodded through about a third of the book then couldn't face it any more.
2,Pretentious & boring!,"The author of this book uses absurd flowery & verbose language to describe a series of violent, homicidal incidents perpetrated by a very forgetable group of murderous ruffians. It's an example of men without morals bludgeoning & beating their way through life & is presented in a totally confusing manner. Who they were, where they came from & what made them tick? Beats me, & frankly, I didn't give a damn! If you do want to read about man's terrible inhumanity to man, written by someone who really understands the English language, try All Souls Rising, by Maddison Bell, not this pretentious clap-trap!"
2,"Okay, we get it.","So there's this aimless drifter who hooks up with a group of bounty hunters whose escapades become increasingly violent until, with the exception of Demonic Will-to-Power Man, they are all dead.P.S. War Is A Force That Gives Us Meaning.I mean, that's it, right? Did I leave anything out? I don't think so. The horrific violence is arresting at first, but it reaches its crescendo, oh, maybe a third of the way through, and after that, McCarthy is just banging on the same key over and over again, to numbing effect. Yes, undoubtedly, he is an impressive stylist, even if the style in question is more or less a Faulkner/Hemingway pastiche, but that's really not enough. Blood Meridian might have made a decent short story, but as a novel, it just becomes unbearably tedious. Are we really this facile?"
3,Novice thoughts from a non-writer,"It seemed some of his prose was contrived, words that did not fit and were non-sequiteurs. It did not always flow smoothly. There were bumps. It was not as difficult to read as Henry James ""Portrait of a Lady"", but like James, he built his paragraphs architectually, and with massive flying buttresses."
2,fiction,"Amazingly beautiful, and beautiful and intense writing. Brutal and gripping, but I was hugely disappointed with the supernatural hocus pocus aspects of the judge and the frayed disjointed ending."
3,McCarthy - Sensless In A Forest Of Misunderstanding Or At The Edge Of Knowledge?,"On it's face, this book makes as much sense as the title to my review. Just like my title, the book makes more sense if you give it some time to thinking it through. After the end of devoting time in such a manor, you will be better able to hazard a guess into the book's implications. In the meantime, however, you will be introduced into a glittering recounting of the violence that is some easy for humans to engage in when dealing with one another. You will also glimpse the bleakness and lack of compass guiding many of those individuals settling the west. It is a moving book, but one that should leave you questioning why it has moved you."
4,Amazing--but painful.,"This book contains some of the best writing I've ever seen. For example, McCarthy wrote an unforgettable description of an attack by a band of wild Comanches (at least I think that's what they were--could have been another tribe). Very difficult read, however, due to violence."
3,Hard work,"Having read most of Cormac McCarthy's work, I was suprised to see I had overlooked his so called masterpiece ""Blood Meridian"". It was only when I read a review of it on its 25th anniversary that I was aware of it.It is an obvious must read for fans of Cormac. I have to say I was slightly disappointed. Perhaps when if I had read it when it first came out, I may have been more impressed. I found the langauge a little too flowery for my liking. The descriptions of the landscape, while often brillant, sometimes are overdone.I think I got the point of the book, but it was a battle to finish it."
5,Definite read for the McCarthy fan,"Picked this up to get into McCarthy afterseeing Np Country and was quite amazed by this gritty and gore unpolished novel.While this might not be the best book to start reading Cormac McCarthy's vast repertoire, it is definitely one that you should read before it becomes another film.The true nature of man is shown in this account of the westward american expansion; quite a violent and horrific time requires a suitable writer to say the least.For the true Cormac fan, this book is a must read. As a fair warning I must warn you that this novel has many graphic passages.blood"
4,hideous but complete,"This book is insane. Wtf is up with the ending?Its a heavy read. Not too much dialogue, which makes itcrawl at times. The descriptions of the landscapeseem inspired by an almost spiritual malevolence.On the whole the feel of the novel is of horror,and hopelessness. Empathy is at last destroyed,by the final horrific act, which goes unspoken."
4,A Literary Endurance Test With Great Rewards,"I just finished Blood Meridian last week. The first fifty pages or so were a bit of a struggle. The more I read, however, the more I came to accept (or even look forward to) Mccarthy's monolithic sentences and paragraph style. While the cold violence is quite intense, I would bet that it was probably fairly accurate for the novel's times and places. History has a tendency to get more glossy and sterile as time moves on. Mccarthy describes an era that most people would have little or no concept of. That is what truly makes this a classic. I hope Ridley Scott doesn't allow the violence to overshadow the real, bleak ideas when the movie comes out in 2009. One thing is certain....it may be the most graphic western ever filmed."
3,Didn't enjoy this as much as I was hoping...,"Perhaps it was the relentless violence. Could have been the alienating vocabulary that poked out of the pages used to describe the terrain and other simple items. Perhaps its because I never saw into the character of ""The Kid"" who I guess was the hero. All that being said there was some staggering writing that I marveled at and the overall sweep of the story was impressive.From a masterwork I would have liked to have seen a little more depth of character shown. I'm sure that was not McCarthy's point of interest here, but a little more balance between it and the scenes of brutality would have made this a more rewarding read for me."
4,Another Very Good Read from McCarthy,"Well, here we go again: Another group of 1-star, pseudo-intellectual reviewers complaining about the themes of evil and brutality, the lack of a happy ending, and a general lack of sunshine and flowers. Clearly, McCarthy is not bothered about the perceived covenants of what does or doesn't make a novel worth reading. Buy the book (or borrow it from your library or a friend), read it, and come to your own conclusions. 1-star reviewers: Back to mass market trash, pop-up books and Disney movie tie-ins is your best option."
1,A lot of reading for little pleasure,"This book felt too much like required reading in high school - so boring in fact I couldn't even finish it. I made it about halfway through and felt like I was reading and reading and not getting anywhere....I kept waiting for somehting to happen....for it to get ""good"" but it just didn't. It was painstakingly boring and bland."
2,An Editor's Nightmare!!!,"I simply don't understand how a writer, no matter how accomplished, can get away with using run-on sentences, huge point-of-view (POV) changes, poor selections of words, and NOT using proper punctuation. There wasn't a single quotation mark throughout the entire story.It was so difficult to read this book because of the above named literary problems that I had to drink coffee to stay awake while I read. I had to repeat many sentences to determine if a character was talking or if I was reading narrative gab. Come to think of it, after all that, the story wasn't even that interesting. Even if Corm had edited his work properly, it still would have resulted in a yawn-fest.I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't like it. Two stars! **"
2,ooops. Amazon didn't send it to me!,"I ordered this book after being ""assured"" it would arrive between Feb 8-12. When I placed the order, it was to arrive on Feb 15. I was on vacation--and leaving the 15th. But we waited....and waited...and waited. No book delivery. We left for home! When I wrote to Amazon after I got home, they said ""give it another week!"" I was 1200 miles away by then--first time I've ordered a book from Amazon and probably the last! Thank goodness for my local library! Got the book before the book club actually met!"
2,The first two pages are great. Then......,"Was McCarthy paid by the number of times he used the word ""and?"""
1,Yecch!,"This has to be one of those books that intellectuals stand up for, just to pose intellectually. This was a very poorly written saga with a plotline that was awkward and impossible to reasonably follow. The characters were imposiible to follow as the author likes to use pronouns without establishing a subject. ""He"" could refer to at least 3 characters at the same time. If you state you like this book with a plethora of adjectives of literary admiration, I have a set of the Emporer's new clothes for you!"
2,Blood Meridian,Very dark and savage view of mankind and the early wars/slaughter of the American Indian.
3,If You Want Blood... You've Got It,"I'm a fan of Cormac McCarthy having read The Road, No Country, The Border Trilogy, etc. I think this novel proves his raw talent as a writer but also that his books became better as he went on.Anything with ""Blood"" in the title, well, you can bet it's going to be pretty violent. This is probably the most violent book I have ever read, but it loses its shock value quickly because it's all at the same level, and it just goes on and on. A friend of mine stopped reading the book halfway through because he just couldn't see what the theme or point of the book was.You can't really choose sides between the main characters in the book, and those they murder along the way. They're all bad actors. Yet it's so well written that you want to keep reading. It does get monotonous at times though and the characters aren't really developed further as you keep reading."
5,Fantastic Contemporary Novel,I had been recommended this book by some friends and had previously read The Road. Simply put an intense and riveting read. Would strongly recommend.
2,Typical Mccarthy,"This was a typical Cormac McCarthy doomsday in the west book. I couldnt finish it as it was repetitous,depressing and not very interesting."
2,A Cure for Bloodlust,"This was a beautifully written novel. The words on the page completely and accurately painted an image of the old west. How accurate can be debated, but i would assume that this novel is closer than Gunsmoke or Bonanza. It is the content of the novel that caused the low rating. Before reading this i would have considered myself a ""fan of violence"". Well, this book was the cure for that. The prose was so vividly, sickeningly accurate and lifelike that i felt i was there, watching the most brutal, senseless atrocities imaginable.Imagine if Michelangelo had used his immense skills of creation to make a very vivid, accurate, precise painting of a rape scene. That is what this novel is. If you can get past the hideous violence, this is a good book, however that was something I was not able to do.*I wrote this review a while ago, after just having finished the novel, with time it has grown on me, it was fantastically written, just too violent. But I can see what others see in it."
4,Cynical & Thought Provoking,"Never one to look at the world through rose-colored glasses, McCarthy really outdoes himself here. Written in his usual quirky syntax, McCarthy will show you a side of the wild West to which you might have preferred to remain oblivious. He will also encourage you to consider the men, great and evil, who built this country and made it what it is today. Finally, for me at least, it set off a new evaluation of the quality and value of life."
5,A drop of blood reflects the stars,"Between the event and the expression, an energy exists too powerful to be harnessed entirely, leaving expression emaciated. But this gap serves as the very setting of this novel of Blakean intensity. McCarthy reveals the true proportions of this ostensibly minute gap-- the proportions of epic.Roaming this infinite (and thereby surreal) terrain, is one of the most memorable characters in the history of literature -- the Judge. To pass over this book is to pass over one of the few truy mythic figures of our time. This book must be read."
4,I like to read,"This book arrived on time and in excellent condition. The plot was just not my style. Every scene depicted was morose, nasty, bloody, crude, ugly. I became so depressed from reading it I did not finish it."
5,Blood Meridian,"A friend of mine who was working on his Masters in English was studying this book as part of his course work and recommended it to me. Some readers have found this book too violent, but I loved it. I read it twice and will read it again. It is realistic, dramatic, and historicly accurate."
2,Harold Bloom compared this book to MOBY DICK?,I scratched and clawed my way to the end of this book. If you are looking at this as the 20th/21st answer to Moby Dick you are bound to be very disappointed. In comparison I found it to be a remarkably monotone and unimaginative book.
2,Not an enjoyable read,"I completely agree with the review by S. Hill ""Sean."" I like the Road, i thought No Country for Old Men was decent, but i did not enjoy Blood Meridian. I feel the author wrote this with a thesaurus in his other hand. No character development and no story. Just a series of very descriptive gorey scenes, which dont get me wrong i would enjoy, but it made for a very boring read. Halfway through it became a task to hurry up and finish."
5,unforgettable,"Haunting and spectacularly efficient prose, structure, and plot.Among the most compelling books I've ever read. In the company of ""Crime and Punishment.""It is dense, it is hard, it is horrifying, and there is nothing redeeming about most of the characters. I suppose that is the point. We are a difficult species.I call this book ""gore porn"" as the violence is beyond nauseating, but again - I believe that's the point.You don't forget reading this book; nor should you."
2,Painful,"I've read tens of thousands of books over the course of my life, both fiction and non fiction and I found this particular tale a dispiriting allegory of men. It wasn't even the violence that disturbed me, it was the poetic application of adjectives ad nauseam that made the entire reading experience tedious and self serving to the point of boredom for me. Often I felt my eyes skimming over the endless journey of these highly unlikeable and disgusting, unredeemable characters...sorry I didn't ""get it"" nor did I find exalted purpose in it like so many other reviewers seem to have found. A total waste of ten bucks and five hours."
2,Violence & Gore and Very Little Else,"Where to start with this book? This is my 5th novel by CM. I am familiar with his style, his keen eye for detail, his characters, his way with dialogue, and the violence. This, however, just seemed like a complete ""gore fest"" to me. Barbaric characters, wayward souls, wasted, wasted lives. It is a difficult and tedious read, humorless, rudderless, and unrelenting violence. Not McComac's best or even better novels, I think."
3,"Group Speak is McCarthy is Good, But............","I have read four of McCarthy's books, the latest being ""Blood Meridian."" This author tells a good story, and his prose is among some of the best of our modern writers. Unfortunately his rambling, cracked philosophical gibberish often detracts the reader from what otherwise would have been an excellent novel. This is an author who is in love with his command of baroque and arcane words, and far too often allows himself (at the expense of the reader) greatluxuries in convoluted, confusing passages more akin to riddles than novels.McCarthy is a precise historian and a good story teller, but too self-absorbed for his own good. ""Blood Meridian"" is a good novel; it could have been a great one."
5,"Not for everyone, hard to stomach, but unforgettable","Easily one of the most well written books I have ever read. Every sentence, all the diction, the pacing, the themes, all balanced themselves into a perfect narrative of despairing Western lore and humanity's archaic purposes. The images McCarthy creates are so vivid and heart searing that after having read the books several years ago, the scenes linger in my imagination and I find myself thinking about them occasionally out of the blue. I wonder about the judge and the little boy he takes in for a day - and what that boy must have thought the next morning when the judge placed his hands over the boy's ears, I think of the desert landscapes and how the light might have cursed it and the darkness damned it. I think, for whatever reason, about that dancing bear and what his eyes must have tried to tell that little blonde girl when the moment happened and nothing could be taken back.Wow - what a great book !"
5,Intensely Powerful,"I was enticed to read McCarthy's ""Blood Meridian"" after listening to Professor Harold Bloom expound on the merits of the book on a recent edition of C-Span's ""Booknotes"". Bloom's praise of McCarthy and the novel were both effusive and well deserved. After finishing the tale,it seemed to me that the author's work should be viewed on two separate levels.First,the grotesque violence and the ceaseless,utter depravity will likely forever change your outlook of that time and place in history and perhaps of human nature as well. But on a larger scale,there is a deeper message.We see in Judge Holden,a creature of pure malevolence,the embodiment of evil incarnate.But,particularly in the final chapter, McCarthy opens our eyes to the fact that this evil,metaphorically expressed in the character of the Judge,vanquishes everything in its path and is in the end,all powerful,omnipotent,and eternal."
2,What's the big deal?,"This year I read Cormac McCarthy for the first time -- Blood Meridian and No Country for Old Men. I FAR preferred No Country. I'm sure diehards would dismiss it as Blood Meridian Lite. But consider reading that instead.This book seems to be one of those novels that has been labeled ""masterpiece"" or ""genius"" so many times that readers give it more slack than it deserves. Certainly, McCarthy has tremendous gifts as a writer.But the relentlessness of the violence does not make it more powerful -- it makes it monotonous. It's like listening to a Eddie Van Halen guitar solo for 7 hours. At times, McCarthy just seems to be trying to outdo whatever grotesque murder / dismemberment scene he came up with 10 pages before. I respect the technical virtuosity, but the book is inherently tedious.Clearly, this book has many passionate adherents. You may become one of them. For everyone else, this book is totally skippable."
4,"if this book is so good, why .........","I have read the reviews. Everyone claims this is the greatest book written in the last 50 years. Maybe so. But there is something I don't understand. If this is such a great book, why hasn't anyone made a movie out of it? I think I know the answer, but I would like to hear what others think."
1,blood meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West,"I am a devout fan of Cormac McCarthy. I have to believe that he must be embarrassed to have this book back on the market. I hated this book and could not bring myself to finish it. It was tedious, pointless, and in the end just boring. This book was written long before McCarthy had mastered the style that has brought him so much fame and credit. In this book, one sees him trying hard to hone his now-extraordinary powers of observation and description, and failing badly. That the publisher decided to release this book again long after it had been retired from view is a violation of public trust. Deserves no gold star as it has no redeeming qualities."
1,too violent,all about violence and no plot what so ever. guess people think he is cool because he writes so violent. I find him boring.
1,Too self-aware of a writer,"Was there a quota on similes? He seems to write one in almost every paragraph; it gets to be quite distracting and almost comical. ""Like......like......like...."" He starts to sound like a valley-girl. I guess I prefer the less ""flowery"" and more straight-forward westerns like the LONESOME DOVE books. This just got more and more annoying as I read. It is only the second book I have read by this author, the first being THE ROAD. That one was simpler and more intriguing, but still not the best thing I have read. I can understand why the academic elites celebrate this author; he writes with that ""I am a great writer"" self consciousness that those people love. I find it boring and condescending. This will probably be the last book I read by McCarthy. He is simply not my cup of tea."
4,Just like a hotel,I did my research and this came as advertisted. Mounting was easy. My wife loves not having to put away the old one.
4,NICE HAIRDRYER,"NICE HAIRDRYER.........WORKS WELL AND MEETS MY NEEDS. THE ONY THING IS THE NIGHTLIGHT IT HAS DOESN;T REALLY ILLUMINATE ANYTHING, SO IT DOESN;T REALLY SERVE IT'S PURPOSE.......OTHER THAN THAT...NO COMPLAINTS¡"
4,Very Good Dryer,This is a very good wall mount dryer that takes up very little space and works well on all hair styles.
5,Conair wall mount hair dryer,"Super product. Used one in a Holiday Inn Epress motel recently and tried to buy one at the motel but they were out. I got on the internet when returning from our vacation and found the same one that we liked at the motel. We tried to find it in various stores while on vacation to no avail. In fact, not many stores even offer wall mount hair dryers. This one also has a night light that comes on automatically when the lights are out. The 1600 watts drys the hair real fast."
5,great hair dryer,This is a great hair dryer and it is nice and compact. Easy to install. If you like the ones at the finer motels you will love this one. Also has a night light.
2,Good for awhile,"I've purchased 3 over 5 years. They work great for about a year and a half, then they start slowing down until they eventually stop working. I would try other brands except not many other models available at this price."
5,Thoughtful and penetrating,"Doris Meredith's understanding of human nature, and her grasp of the difficulties of detection and prosecution of crime, add up to a splendid mystery which absorbed me and kept me guessing. She has assembled some marvelous characters, all bookish by nature, who end up doing some amateur sleuthing that shames the cops. This is a tender story, filled with empathy toward people in trouble. I cherish these books, and believe mystery readers will love them too."
3,Make it 3 1/2 stars. It is really pretty good,"I liked the book. The plot was the kind I like, with a niceAgatha Christie type venue & almost no violence. But my oneongoing annoyance with the book (I haven't read any others inthis series) was the boyfriend. Somehow he didn't fit in,& I would have much preferred to have more of the women in thebook club (who seem to almost disappear) and less of the boyfriend who was as unappealing as he believed himself to be."
3,Too much Lolita and Bogart,"I agreee with a prior reviewer - enough already of Ryan! He's the middle-aged ""hero"" who lusts after Megan, the main character in the book. The creepy factor? Ryan is the father of Megan's best friend - and Megan ""grew up in his house along with his daughter."" Ick.The story itself is very interesting with appealing minor characters. The frequent references to other mystery writers and old Bogart films gets really annoying. Yes, we've all read those books. No, this is not a Bogart/Bacall romance. Bogart met Bacall when she was a woman, albeit a very young woman, he was not a father figure to her while she was growing up. Again, ick."
1,Boring,"It's hard to find a mystery I don't like, but Ms. Meredith's new series is so boring I can't get past the third chapter. I LOVED the John Branson series and find it hard to believe the same woman wrote these books. I hope she goes back to the character she did best and leaves this series in the back, dusty stacks where it belongs."
4,Singular view of the march through medical school and beyond,"This is an interesting book and it certainly held my attention. But it was not especially enjoyable to read; at the time it came into my hands, a friend who was seriously ill was being treated at a teaching hospital. Those who prefer not to know too much about the white coats and their training (which is certainly being conducted on patients at teaching hospitals) may want to avoid this book.That said, some of the stories about patients are pretty eye opening, as well. The human personality is remarkably fixed; a dirty old man who has probably made women miserable all his life will persist, even at death's portal. Some of these stories demonstrate the sad human drama caused by bone-deep denial; others show the amazing aspect of the creative, healing interaction between patient and physician."
2,Not as good as it could be,"I read this book thinking that stories written by a doctor would be fascinating. I honestly got tired of hearing the author talk about crying every 10 minutes and all of her self esteem issues. I wanted to hear more stories and less personal musings. The stories were interesting in their own right, but went on WAY too long. I would have rather had a more brief description of events and more of them. (more about the patients much less whining and agonizing by the author)."
3,personal anecdotes,"Dr Ofri has written a moving account of a resident doctor's personal experiences. Residency program is indeed a trial (and training) by fire which can either melt or strengthen the heart of a novice doctor. Being a doctor myself, I have been to ""hell and back"" with many of my patients. There are quite a few Dr Sitkins in the world of medicine : humane and highly sensitive doctors hiding behind a facade who snap when the reality of the harsh world and its inequalities,espeically, in life and death situations become unbearable."
3,Singular Intimacies: A little overdramatic,"Not that medicine isn't intense, but it seems as though Ofri is writing more to appeal to expectations of medical training that one gets while watching hospital dramas on television. While I can appreciate her approach and intent -- to show human relationships in the objective world of medicine -- I think that her overt attempts make the book fall short of what it could be. Her anecdotes are sometimes entrancing, sometimes engulfing, but in many cases are not entirely believable. She overstates the ineptitude of those in training while playing to expectations of doctors' callousness and scientific mindsets. Having read this book soon after another in the same genre that was, quite honestly, much better (Atul Gawande's Complications) I was slightly disappointed with this book."
5,One of my Top 5 dance trax ever,"I have only ever heard the Armin Van Buuren remix (track 3) and I love it. I first heard it on DJ Tiesto's - Magik 6 Live in Amsterdam - where it fits perfectly with the trance style. If you like this track, have a listen to Magik 6."
4,Kraut-rock and VU filtered through the Fall,"One of the band's most important releases, this has a more experimental aspect than the previous SLATES ep. Songs like the 2-part ""Winter,"" ""Hip Priest,"" and ""Iceland/Island"" are rhythmic and long in a kind of Can way (Mark was a big fan) while ""Deer Park"" has keyboards via the Velvet Underground's ""Sister Ray."" This is not to say the songs are inferior. On the contrary, the songs are excellent because they still sound original and like The Fall . The two-drummer lineup works very well on the opener ""The Classical,"" and there is some really catchy material in ""Just Step Sideways"" and ""Who Makes the Nazis?"" Problems? Yeah, a 10+ minute problem in the final song, the atrocious ""And This Day."" Everything else is great, and it beats the hell out of most of this ""indie-rock"" the kids like these days."
3,Qty is actually just one though it says 24 in description,"The description states ""Available in 24 pack only"". It is actually just one poncho, I can buy these locally for .99 cents, so 3+ dollars for one is a little silly. The item was however exactly what is says and pictures, this is identical to the ones I buy locally and it is a thin plastic poncho, it's perfect to keep in the car or backpack for unexpected rain. I also keep one in my motorcycle, I don't intentionally ride in the rain this is perfect to keep my leather jacket from damaged in unexpected storm.This is a great option for a back-up, but I wouldn't pay 3.50 for it. Look at your local general store, I even saw these at REI once (for .99 cents also)..."
5,one of there best cd's.,"""dead"" is one of Obituary's best cd's. it's recorded live. it's got all of there best song's from ""i'm in pain"" to ""Chopped in Half"". i suggest you get this cd if you get any."
2,Feeling ripped off,"The original film was in Italian, widescreen, and ran 85 minutes. This VHS tape, however, is dubbed into English, cropped, and runs just 60 minutes (even though the box says it's an 85-minute film). Buyers beware.The film is essentially about a sexual fastasy within a sexual fantasy. Effective moments of eeriness and eroticism help somewhat elevate the material."
5,Necessary cd to add to your Curtis collection!,"This is a great CD! This CD is different from Superfly, which all his other works are compared to, but is a definite must have for fans who already own the "" People Get Ready"" box set and are looking to explore specific 70's albums. Pick this up!"
1,An astounding work of fiction!,"What a fantastic fantasy novel! I was riveted to my sofa as I scanned the lines, immersing myself in the world the author has created.Wait...it IS fiction...right?"
3,ping ping the amazing flute,"Lucifer my twin i invoke thee. satan my friend i call you from the depths, join me in my depravity.Jack,I thought about your pants today, the way the swing to and fro across your jimsong. I long for your tushy.oh lord please make them stop they are tearing me apart.this book is awesomeish."
2,conversion story,"Billed as a conversion story to Christianity, I found that the last three chapters dealt with that subject. The other 18 were about the ever-inticing walk into the ""dark side"". The book has very detailed information about the ""dark side"", the accuracy of which can only be known by the initiates. In faith discussions it is useful to know something of the other belief systems, but it is equally or perhaps more important to know and understand the position you claim to represent. I would have appreciated more details on how his conversion to Christianity has changed his life.Another negative in my opinion is a bit of Catholic bashing, which is common to other Chick Publications I have seen (such as Death Cookie). Though the author reveals that along his life he has been one of the hypocrites (for example simultaneously moving through the Wicca ranks and the Old Catholic Church) that turn others away from Christ, which means that it isn't the insitution's fault but the sinners within."
5,Please Read!!,"Brother William Schnoebelen has a great testimony for anyone that's been involved in Freemasonry, Wicca, Traditional Satanism and other occult organizations because he's been in a lot of them. Praise God he's been set free through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ out of he bondage of Satan!! Reading this book will open up your eyes to what Satan's false religions and spirits of error can do to a person -- leading them to depravity and eventually, eternal damnation in the fires of hell. This book is a definite must read for anyone wanting to know more about what is going on in the world of the occult and how to combat these doctrines of devils through the power of God and His word."
1,Boring and Silly,"this book comes across as the stories and everything else in this book is untrue. i just feel that the auther is making up some of these stories, or he has a medical (mental) condition or something. i couldnt bear to finish this book i read about 2 chapters of it. but if ur someonje who believes in weird things or is superstitios u may like this book. and fyi im a practicing Christian with a college education and much knowledge about Christain, Jewish, and Islamic theology."
3,Pretty decent offering. Very atmospheric,"This is a pretty good offering, and if you like Gregorian Chant style music, or like the songs offered, you will like this compilation of interesting tunes.The quality once again is top notch, as are the choices. There is something about hearing these Gregorian chanters singing popular music - it's not as good as the original - it's just different - in a good way. Buy this cd and hear for yourself. It's a good investment."
1,Poorly formatted,Poorly formatted. Lacks active table of contents. I ended up deleting it and going back to the copy printed in the collected works.
5,A Knockout First Novel,"Sid Gustafson's ""Prisoners of Flight"" weaves a tale of harmonious polarity between today's youth and Vietnam's generation. The disparate and troubled characters meet in a perilous Montana wilderness, thrown together by shared acts of incaution. The four protagonists (soon five, soon tragically four again) antagonize, then resolve their personal demons while struggling to survive the oncoming winter. Written in an exquisitely uncommon style, ""Prisoners"" provides an enlightening and delightful read remindful of Toni Morrison's ""The Bluest Eye."" Thank you Dr. Gustafson!"
4,"Book, Prisoners Of Flight","A good book, liked his Horses They Rode better,though.Recieved quickly and in good condition"
4,Outstanding!,"Ali Farka Toure's ""Niafunke"" is one great album, showcasing the West African approach to the guitar, and proving that Toure is getting better with each passing year. It was genius to avoid the homogenization of ""world"" music by recording this CD in Mali, near home, with local musicians. The music can be described as a sort of ""Sahara blues"", a mix of North and West African traditional music and American blues, but there's much more to it than that. Play this CD, be taken away by it, listen to the voices and instruments (African drums and strings), and you'll agree with Toure, who says that ""Timbuktu [is] right at the heart of the world."""
4,Great album--a different take,"I agree that the vocals are underproduced (which is why this terrific set doesn't get 5 stars from me). The playing is truly inspired, and there's enough of a contemporary feel to keep it from sounding like a field recording by an academic. Ironically, a single-mike and no remixing might have been a better option, ala Robert Johnson in a hotel.BTW, the JLH comparison is apt, but an even better one would be Robert Pete Williams, who had an even greater tendency to discard standard musical forms."
5,Perfect as a comeback album,He indeed returned to the source. The music is beautiful. Congratulation Farka.
4,Blues roots,Very rythmic. Makes the roots a little easier to understand to the modern electronic ear.
4,Classic indie rock in all it's implications,"This album is a very good indie rock album so if you like that kind of music you will not be disappointed. But if you're looking for a unique sound you won't find it here. That's not a criticism, really - just a reflection of how familiar this genre is nowadays."
1,Poor showing from an often brilliant band,"Rarely am I motivated to go out of my way to express a negative opinion of an album but really, 2 cents is about all this record is worth. Song after song begins promisingly and then just devolves into boring awfulness. Versus's earlier albums, ""The Stars are Insane"" and ""Secret Swingers"", are each so much more impressive and enjoyable -- both of them, in fact, are compulsive favorites of mine -- and the one that followed this, ""Hurrah"", seems a step back in the right direction. But here, dull songwriting, overly slick production, mannered vocals... it just makes me sad."
4,A way to stretch your skills,"I agree with the previous reviews, even the negative one. You should be aware that these projects are not for the novice woodworker---they are an excellent way, however, to stretch your woodworking skills for those who want to go beyond the basics. Two things to be aware of: virtually all the projects require the use of a lathe, and the projects are bigger than they appear. If you're thinking that these are a couple of inches high, wrong. Most are a foot or more high or wide. You will also need to blow up the patterns on a copier, they are not full sized. All of that said, the book is worthwhile, though expensive. Check ABEbooks for price comparisons. The MORE book is cheaper on Amazon, this book cheaper on ABE."
3,Looks good,"Basically, the contents weren't what I expected. The title led me to expect mechanisms for making wooden automata. This book doesn't give general ideas but the design of 15 particular mechanisms such as a wooden pump, or clock. I'll probably use it one day but only as a breather from wooden automata."
1,RIP OFF! COMPLETE RIP OFF!,"Purchased book for $77 new with high expectations. However, the list price on back cover is $21! The information within the book is worth only $21.One can do alot better with ""507 Mechanical Movements: Mechanisms and Devices (Dover Science Books)"" for $8 and figure out their own woodworking design from that book."
3,It is what it is!,"This is a handy light vacuum cleaner; not a lot of suction power and the ""handy"" duster attachment is constantly popping out and in the way; contrary to one buyer's review, there is a recessed carrying handle. It's a $50.00 item."
4,Great Vacuum for the price,"I originally bought the Eureka 6820AD Contour Cannister Vacuumbecause it was on sale and I had a coupon for Amazon, however, now that I have been using the vacuum - its pretty nice. It has some nice features like an auto-rewind powercord and places to hook the extensions on to the cannister for easy storage. It does what a vacuum should do and that is suck things up off the kitchen floor. All in all I am satisfied with this purchase."
1,This is so lame!,"This vacuum is so lame. I shouldn't have bought it!Lame suction - So weak!!Difficult to find bags - only a few are available online but kind of expensive for this vacuumNo handle to carry (There is a hole to carry?? on the BOTTOM!! It's so inconvenient!!)Power switch is on the canister itself, Not handle power switch.I wish I could return this lame vacuum... Highly regret"
3,Nice enough ... bags a little scarce.,"It does a good enough job, and I like the hidy-hole implements, and the retractable cord. The secution is adequate for my scored/stained concrete and rugs, and it is generally sufficient and convenient. I DO have a little trouble finding bags, so I've finally found them for a good price on the web. I don't go thru them all that fast, so I guess that's not such a big deal, though finding bags in my local Wally Werld would be nice ..."
5,the very very goth rock of the year!,"this is one of my favourest, what did i say, it IS my favourest album i bought this year!!every track on this cd leads us back to the early goth sound at the end of the 80ties. sacrifice appears on one of the older material of them, but that doesn't make it boring: it's a new version that is more powerful.my favourite song: into the iceleads you into the cold and deep soul of mary shelley's frankenstein."
2,Disappointed,Only the last track I liked. I bought this because Empire of the Vampire is such a good cd. This one on the other hand lacks much of what Vampire offers. Almost seems like two different bands.
4,For the 80's goths,"This is a great album for anyone who's into the 80's sounding electronic/goth rock in the vein of the Mission, Love Like Blood, Children on Stun, etc. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing astounding or groundbreaking about the Paralysed Age, you've all heard something similar to this, probably back in the 80's, but the music is very quality nevertheless. I have two of Paralysed Age's albums, the other being Empire of the Vampire, and this is the one I would definately recommend, I think the song quality, structure and composition far exceed Empire. If you're looking for a good retro 80's goth rock band, check out the Paralysed Age."
2,"Lots of talk, well, not so much help","This book mainly tells you how to write quickly, cursively and legibly, if your former handwriting is slow, separate and illegible. Some common senses such as that you must write in relaxed mood and hand position, may be of help. However, if you are already a neat writer and aim at adding some artistic touch to your handwriting, no useful advice can be found in this book. Therefore, I think, that is the reason why this book is entitled ""better"" handwriting instead of ""nice"" handwriting.And, one thing I do not like in this book is, the authors' instructions are just too wordy."
2,needs more basic letter formation examples.,i was looking for a book with letter formations and completion of words with illustrations but this book has none to help a person in that area.
2,My warning,"i wanted it in spanish, the orginal language... the only thing i can enjoy are the singing parts where they didnt dubb it... if you are looking for the movie in its original Spanish format, dont buy this"
3,Strange Santa Swats Satan in Spanish!,"This is not a good film...but it is strangely amusing. Admittedly, I can only assume I find this film interesting and joyfully nostalgic because I saw it during the Christmas season as a child in the late 60's/early 70's (it came around to local theatres annually, along with THE CHRISTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T-another gem!) You have to understand the appeal of these K.Gordon Murray-things, or else it's probably best to stay away. I ""get it"", so I'm one of the lucky ones! Ho Ho Ho"
5,santa claws vs. the devil (pitch),"I saw this santa claws movie twice at the theater with my mom in the 70's.I still like it. If you like santa movies you are in for a surprise. ""That old pitch {Demon}is gonna make that poor little mexican girl want to steal again."""
1,Really Bad Santa,"Dreadful Mexican production from 1959 accomplishes the impossible - it's worse than ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" (1964). The folks at ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" had a ball with this holiday turkey. Directed by the one and only René Cardona. A pity that Santo never made a Christmas movie."
5,FYI: A Christmas Fantasy For Both Young & Old Alike :),"I own this edition & ""HIGHLY"" recomend it for all ages. There is nothing too deep here, but there is a lot of fun to be enjoyed, and as is the devil's due...he looses. VCI, a DVD publisher, has just announced ( at the Home Theater Forum web site)today their Christmas releases, which includes this motion picture. While the release date & SRP haven't been announced (yet), the film has been restored from a 35mm negative, which means it should be head & shoulders above the current released edition. This 1959 motion picture will be released on November 11th 2011, and has a SRP of $14.99 from it's publisher's web site (VCI). As soon as Amazon has a pre-order place holder up & running I will be ordering my copy ""ASAP""...HO...HO...HO...have fun :)"
3,Buy Smart Choices instead,"This book is okay, but it's poorly structured and repetitive. It doesn't offer a clear, systematic process for making decisions. I think Smart Choices is a far, far better book. Simpler, better structured, easier to work with."
1,Repetitive,"The amazing thing about this book is that it takes the authors nearly 250 pages to deliver a convoluted, befuddled message. Repetitive and dull."
5,Love it!,"My 2 year old son LOVES this movie, and so I got the book because sometimes I go crazy listening to the music! great book with lots of fun little extras!"
5,A Perfect Companion,"The just released movie on DVD ""Hairspray"" is a phenomenon and a force to be reckoned with. Possibly one of the best movies of the year, Hairspray is about acceptance in a time when it wasn't expected. The Adam Shankman movie is fun, energetic, and full of life. And so is this marvelous companion book.Filled with pictures, behind the scenes stories, and narratives by all of the principal movers and shakers in the movie, ""Hairspray: The Movie Musical"" serves as a wonderful guide. The information contained in the book offers a peek inside the creative process. It's amazing the amount of talent and work that goes into an hour and a half movie.Just as fun as the movie is, this book covers it all, and doesn't leave you hanging. If you have a Hairspray Fan in your family, this is the PERFECT Christmas present: affordable and really, really fun!"
5,"MSG, Michael live!","If you are a michael schenker freak, then this is the album for you! Michael covers his entire career here from Scorpions; Another piece of meat, to current MSG favorites. The UFO songs sound great with Michael, but UFO is UFO. Still, they burn. Michaels' playing is hot, sweaty, and at it's best here. I've been a Michael fan since I saw him for the first time in '77, and being a guitar player, I can appreciate the beauty of what he does and is. I don't care if Michael reaches 75 years old and grows a beer gut or whatever; Live-Unforgiven is MSG at their best!"
1,i bought this with a gift certificate....,"i was skeptical about buying this because it's like the fifth or sixth live album put out by michael schenker not including the ufo live recordings. since it included many songs i never heard live before i figured what the heck.the musicianship was very good but the lead singer on most of the songs is so generic that he made most of these classics sound absolutely bland! the guest singer who sang""assault attack"",""on and on"", and""another piece of meat"" saved the album. otherwise this is a waste of time.i think ""assault attack"" was the last classic album that schenker put out on his own and his only hope now is to rejoin ufo.if you're into generic fast guitar playing (vai,satriani, etc.) i would suggest you buy this album, but if you like hard driving songs with balls check out ""one night at budokan"" by msg or ""strangers in the night"" by ufo."
3,Short Book on Cults and Errors,"This book was written for the average reader who might not know much about cults and other false doctrines in the evangelical church. The book deals with a limited number of cults including the Mormons, Jesus Only (Oneness Pentecostals) and oddly the Seventh-day Adventist.My reason for only giving it a three star is not because of the author. Dr. Palma is one of the best Assemblies of God theologians. I gave it the rating simply because it is not very deep and is quite short. At best it is an overview of cults and false teachings. The ""truth"" aspect is also very limited. Other books on cults should be read unless your time is limited."
3,Allons-y,"Unfortunately I bought this thinking it would meet the requirements of the French class. However, it was not as complete as the teacher expected. So I had to buy another book at the bookstore. I returned this book for credit which I believe I have not used as yet."
3,Item condition not as described,"Positive: fast shipping, price was cheap.Negative: the item condition was worse than described, it looked liked it had been dipped in water. Fortunately there was no missing or torn page."
4,"Not bad, could be better","I find the organization is a little ""off"" with learning the tenses and grammar, and there are some small grammatical mistakes. The CD included is good to listen to to hear native accents."
1,An Organizational Mess,"Both in this text and in the exercise book, there is a constant use of words that the student has yet to learn and are often not in the glossary. There are also many mistakes in grammar throughout. The decision to try to introduce slang was poorly made, as the slang that is used is incredibly outdated and, even if it were not now, it would be so in a year."
5,Too bad Luke isn't writing anymore,"I discovered this book serendipitously about five years ago. It's fantastic. Funny, wise and poignant in ways that most modern novels of the past two decades have completely missed. I kept waiting for another book...but I guess this one wasn't such a hit. Too bad. Luke Whisnant seemed to have real insight to the outsiders among us and a compassion that is all too rare in young novelists."
4,Required Reading,"I was fortunate enough to take classes at East Carolina University with Luke serving as my Associate Professor. The man flat-out knows how to write concise, tight and poignant prose. Just for better understanding of his style, I bought this book and read it prior to taking my second class of his - it's very good. His short stories are exemplary as well, and could be found with some good searching skills."
1,BAD!,one pad Stoped working 3 days after. with regular easy use.no response from support. none whatsoever!
2,Frustrating....,"The unit sounds great. Has great drum sounds and the layouts for the various kits are logical and good choices. The physical profile is great -- Very slim, very sexy looking. The pads have a very nice solid rubber feel to them.But.... The functional area on the pads is very very small. The pads are are a very comfortable 4""x4"", but, the area that will actually trigger the unit is about 1"" by 1.5"". It is remarkably difficult to play reliably which makes this otherwise phenomenal little unit trash-fill material.I have had some success by placing a little sticker on the ""sweet spot"" of each pad, but, this is very unrewarding. Additionally, there seems to be a problem with the controller of the unit -- intermittantly, if you hit 2 pads at the same time, only one will sound; this is similar to problems other people are having with the iED01, so, I think the units share some internals that suffer from design flaws."
3,thought it was the coolest but then...,"When i First got my drum pad it was really cool but 2 days later one of the pads stopped working, but besides that it was every ting i expected."
4,Parrot CK3400 LS is almost everything.,"The CK3400 LS GPS model works very good. It is easy to connect to, has a good microphone, voice recognition, and various options. It did everything as the Parrot web site said it would except for one thing. We tesed it with several phones and they all worked great. But then we tested it with a Palm 750 which is running Windows Mobile 5.0, just like soem of the other phones we tested. But this phone did not sync any contacts at all and made it very hard to use. It would still allow you to talk and answer phone calls but you could not dial from your contacts. There is a manual sync option to do one contact at a time but that is just ridiculous for how much you pay for this Parrot and the Palm itself."
2,Not very rugged,We have had lots of trouble with the bluetooth ever since installing it ( which was very complicated). Dialing a number using the dial is not convenient at all.
1,poorly sized,Unfortunately these are sized as 8-13. They will not fit size 12 shoes. The arch is too far back. MAYBE they will fit size 10 okay. I would recommend arch supports that have a more precise sizing.
2,not for every foot...,"while not terrible uncomfortable, i find the arch support in the wrong place for my feet; the support feels too low and too much in the center to properly support my arch. thankfully they have a money-back guarantee, so if you buy them, make sure you keep your receipt, just in case they don't fit your specific foot."
4,Excellent But Not Quite Transcendent,"We are the world, etc. Nothing new as far as that goes, of course, but it's great to see such fantastic artists as U Srinivas and Sheila Chandra pushed out a little farther into mainstream awareness. The album's mix is unparallelled and the track selection superb, but unfortunately the collection never rises above the sum of its parts.It's certainly useful for relaxation and meditation, though I generally prefer the consistent tone provided by a single artist or group. It's also an outstanding introduction to the Real World label and the quiet side (don't say New Age, please) of world music in general. You can't go wrong with Bliss, but make sure to graduate to the full-length albums of the singers and players herein."
2,Land Rover III Performance Portfolio,The good thing is that I ordered a couple other publications on the Land Rover. This one was simply a collection of magazine articles on the Land Rover III at the time it was in the showrooms for purchase. While perhaps of some interest they didn't give me any useful information regarding restoration or mechanical work on them.
2,"Fun, but not too instructional","I cannot recommend this software for people, like myself, who want to become better gamblers. I was hoping for some automatic tutorial that would caution me when I was making a foolish play. Instead what I had to do was constantly open a pop up window, press ""By The Books"" for their advice, close the window, and continue my play. Needless to say, that gets a little monotonous. So, while good play advice is there, it's just not automatically given as I hoped."
1,The best worst movie!,"HomewreckerThis is one of the worst movies I have had the sad priviledge to (unfortunately) buy! The plot is pure kindergarten material. The actors (sorry for those who really are), are not even of the High School level as I have seen better in one of those high schools! Really! I am not mentioning anything about the quality of the pictures and decor. I was not only bored, but my sense of being taken for a ride was at it's peak, and constantly ringing the bell! What a real waste of money and time! Want something reeeeeeally good? Try ""La cage aux folles"" or ""Brokeback mountain""! That is real movie, and there are many more to choose from! Save your money!!"
2,Overhyped PhotoJ Churn Out Mediocre Ego Inflated Retrospec.,"Come on. These guys are OK, but do they really deserve their own book? Yeah, they've got the twin factor going for them, but as photographers I wouldn't spend 60 bucks on this book unless my coffee table was lacking a good paperweight. You're better off spending the money on some Tri-X film and shooting yourself. Trust me, you'd learn a lot more then flipping through ""In Times of War and Peace""."
5,LOVE Bing & Bong,"My kids (2 & 5) both love it! I only wish there was more Bing and Bong out there for the purchase because its hard to find this show on TV. And as a graduate of CLUB KID UNIVERSITY myself, I love the funky tribal back beats. Just bought one for my friend who's having a baby!"
1,registered locally,My comment has nothing to do with tiny planets. I ordered this DVD not knowing that is registered for an area in America. So i think it's better that it is not sold outside the USA. The only problem is that i haven't found a sight in Europe which also sells this DVD.So now only watching the box itself is the only solution.Leonie van der Graft
3,"warm, bulky, huge!","I got this with the intent of having a sleeping bag that would allow me to tolerate low temps, and that I could tote around without fuss. It is, as you might imagine, VERY warm. However, it is very large and heavy, and barely fits into a large hiking backpack. Definitely would not purchase again because of 1. size 2. weight. If these are not major concerns that it will serve you well."
2,OLDER EDITION!,"Thw printing date on this publication was 1991. It has NO computer words included i.e. byte, website, email, etc.I didn't return it beacuse it was a gift for a 96 year old Aunt who enjoys crosswords. And she didn't want to wait."
3,Surprised me twice,"When I first bought this many years ago, I was quite surprised at how cheesy it sounded. I almost threw it away. At the time I was into hot big band and faster, higher, louder! What one expected from Sandoval. The other day this came on shuffle and I couldn't get over to change it right away. I honestly couldn't even remember what CD it was. About the third song in, I was mesmorized at the beautiful playing I was hearing. I really like this album now - for what it is - beautiful melodies and excellent solo trumpet/flugel. Sometimes the backup is annoying, but usually it is quite pretty and nice. I'm glad I didn't throw it away after all."
2,Not Arturo-Not Jazz,"A big disapointment. I got the cd at an Arturo concert. A great, burnin' highnote concert. On the way home I tried listening to it but couldn't stand it. The only plus that I give the cd is that he plays the fluff-filled remakes very nicely. If you are looking for popular music remakes, this is the cd for you. If you are looking for standard Arturo, look elsewhere. I will never listen to this cd again."
3,Clever,The way in which this episode shows the ridiculousness of bigotry and prejudice is quite clever.
2,An obvious racism sermon,"""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"", is obviously..... too obvious. Well, it's trying to make viewers turn from thoughts of racism by flashing pictures of worlds burning and being destroyed and a long lecture in the briefing room. The self-destruct scene is chilling, but we could really do without all the preaching."
2,Disappointing,"Though we need a book like to inspire young women to go into politics, ""A Room at a Time"" disappointed me. I was expecting something more energetic, since this is such an important cause. But the book made the story of women in politics seem strangely boring. The observations in it weren't very original or imaginative."
1,Just Pitiful!,"This is a insult to the original Smokey and the Bandit movie the first one was such a classic, then the second one came along it was bad then the 3rd one came and it has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie is not funny at all I don't know where some people come from who find this rediculous movie funny. Every actor in it looks really washed up and the radio that Sheriff Justice has in his car is just unreal and rediculous. If you have never seen this movie and maybe if you just saw the first one and you are on some kind of Smokey and the Bandit high dont watch it you'll feel very pitiful about just how bad some movies can get."
4,A Solid and worth while book,"This book is not one of my favorites but is a great resource. This book has a lot of great ideas but in my opinion does have some flaws. There is a section on cardio and eating which is good, the workout programs in the book are good but not my favorite. Over all I would say this bood is a worth while book on strength training and most people would learn at least something from the book to make it worth your money."
1,Not too good,"I am a personal trainer I wanted to give this book to my client co he can do some exercises at home but a lot of stuff is OK for gym not home, you will still have to get a lot of workout stuff ... this is 3 book from Men's Health and the other are much better"
3,just out dated. I should have asked what year,just out dated. I should have asked what year the magazine was written. live and learn. I am not upset
3,beginners beware,"This book is well written and well organized with lots of great info and exercises! But, if you are a beginner, you might find yourself overwhelmed, undermotivated and uncertain how to begin. At least that was my experience."
5,A lot of info in there.,I love the magazine and the book is no different. Packed full of usefull information. I've been into fitness and bodybuilding for years so I was familiar with a lot of this stuff from the get go but still it is quite the handy little guide. Anyone looking to better their body will appreciate this book. I am a RN and found the anatomy lessons in this book were right on and should be easy for anyone to understand. Truly a great tool to add to anyones workout.
3,"Horror with a twist. Illusion with a camera, Torment with a F-","Horror, with a twist. Illusion with a camera, Torment with a F-Mr. Saur, Greg's ""sour-ball "" teacher didn't believe Greg's report about the evil camera he found last summer Greg decides to prove it. He brings back the evil camera. That changes reality in the future. In order for Greg to get an ""A"", he needs to prove his story is true. And now the camera's back, the nightmare continues by making Greg obese .The Goosebumps series is a great way to get children interested in reading.{Don't you worry parent the stories are not really that scary ,but do read with a child if you are concern }"
3,Not as good as the original,"Hmm. This one was okay. It had its moments of humor and fun, but overall I have to say I like the first one better. You just can't improve upon perfection. Still, it was fun and I would think a good addition to any child's collection."
3,Revenge of the camera,"When Greg writes about the evil camera (which he found in the prequel ""Say cheese and die""), his English teacher doesn't believe him and gives him an F. Greg decides to dig up the old camera and prove his teacher wrong.This wasn't nearly as good as the first book. The events the camera showed/made happen to Greg and Shari were a bit too weird for my taste."
4,Goosebumps #44,"This is THE best Goosebumps work ever! Greg becomes hugely fat, and it is descibed in an outrageously funny fashion. VERY VIVIDLY described, too. I now think Goosebumps are too immature, but I would buy this if I saw it agoin, and IF I could somehow get it."
5,A real classic,"One of the most wonderful children's books there is. A reader's delight. I miss the larger format of the copy I had while growing up, but the book is well made and the illustrations are crisp and exciting. A must have."
5,Erotic Romance Novel,"I recommend LEGENDARY LOVER to those who are willing to stretch their boundaries, put aside preconceived ideas of what a romance novel should be. This story is a wonderfully intellectual erotic read, a true EROTIC ROMANCE. She simply achieves a very appealing balance of love, history, and lots of hot sex! In the erotica department, Susan's imagination knows no limits. This story is about Venus Duras the daughter of Pasha and Trixie Duras (A Touch of Sin). Jack and Venus are two headstrong people who make a darling couple. Neither of them want to make comments or become married. Nevertheless, they cannot pass up the sexual awarness that is between them even a hand shake causes an inexplicalbe thrill to run threw them both. During a few months of passionate, love the find that they cannot deal with being apart from each other. I do not recommend this book to those who are easily offended by erotic sex."
1,At a loss for words....,"I'm a little ashamed to even have this on my ""read"" shelf. I noticed it had a lot of 4 and 5 Star ratings and I literally had to double check the book I was reading... (or was trying to read), I guess that's what makes this forum so great, everyone has and is able to share there own opinions, and in my opinion it was really, really bad!"
2,Not Johnson's Best,"I buy all of Susan Johnson's novels. Unfortunately, the last one that I actually felt had a good story and interesting characters was Brazen (which I'm re-reading now). Legendary Lover is not that great, but I got through reading this one as opposed to her last two novels in the Duras family saga. I would say, that if you're a fan of Ms. Johnson's previous novels you'll enjoy Legendary Lover, but it doesn't live up to her previous novels."
1,Terrible,This was one of the worse books i have ever read and I usually like this author very much. There is no plot at all. The entire book is one sex scene after another.
1,Porn not Romance,Reading the back cover of this book did not lead me to believe that it was pornographic in nature; reading the second chapter did. The book was too offensive to finish.
1,Absolute junk,"I've been reading romance novels for 20 years. I always enjoy sexy, romantic stories. But, this is the first novel I've absolutely, positively hated! I've never read a book by this author, and won't buy another one either. There is no ""romance"" and very little plot to keep a reader's interest. I was also surprised by the use of a lot of modern profanity. Recommendation: save your money!"
4,One of her best yet.,I've read most of her books and they usually start out strong but left me disappointed. This time I was left satisfied all the way. You must buy it to believe it but its definately one of her best yet.
4,SJ is the queen of dialogue,"Of all the authors I have read, Susan Johnson's dialogues are exceptional. This book is a light, easy, entertaining read. Not her best, but certainly worth the price. The name ""Venus"" was a little grating on such an independent woman, but this book will certainly stay on my shelf with all the others."
2,I should have read the reviews before I read it!,"I only got half way through with the book when I put it down. It was obvious to me there was going to be more of the same in the last half of the book and frankly I didn't want to waste my time. It was then that I checked the reviews from other readers that confirmed my suspicions. I didn't like it that Venus gave in so quickly. I thought the book was going to be about a rake pursuing a woman who didn't want him when all the others did. I was so wrong. If you like sex scenes galore, this book is for you... if you like interesting plots and maybe some (the key word here is some) sex to spice it up, then look elsewhere."
4,"One long, hot, steamy orgy","I agree with other reviewers that this book is lacking in plot, and historical data. However, the numerous sex scenes are great. Undoubtedly, Jack Fitz-James is a ""legendary lover."" Another deviations is that the female lead character is neither a virgin nor a widow, while the hero, typically, is a rake and a rogue. While many writers devote their entire plots to efforts by the hero to bed the girl, this book begins with the couple having sex the second time they meet. Jack arrives at midnight, and after a 10-minute waltz with Venus, he drags her to their hosts' library where they spend hours locked in a fantastic sexual encounter (after she makes him find and borrow some condoms). The use of condoms is something you don't usually find in historical romances either. In spite of the weak plot, this is one you can't put down."
2,Terrible,"This is the worst of Susan Johnson book's. It is also the first of her books a read, I almost didn't read any others. The dialogue is forced and contrived. The love scenes are almost indifferant. I wanted to take the characters and slap them both. They are shallow and self center and hard to care about. Luckily I decided to give Ms. Johnson another chance and I have been very pleased with the other books I've read."
1,the most unromantic romance novel I've ever read!,".... This book had NO plot to speak of and all the characters did was have sex. A porno flick has nothing on this book. There was no intimacy between the couple, only vulgar words and HARD CORE sex. She's [quite free with sexuality] and he has little esteem for women. ...dont buy it expecting a heart wrenching story of two people meant to be together."
1,BOR-ing and stupid,"They meet in the first chapter; he's interested but she resists. Next segment they're off ""doing it"" in a room during a party at his godmother's. No plot. No development of character before they start copulating. No interest for this reader - I'm going to throw it in the trash (and it has to be reeeally bad for me to throw away a book). Spend your money on something else."
3,Legendary Lover,"At first I didn't think I'd liked the book. The sex scenes seemed too impossible and the language much too modern. However, I found myself thinking about the book and the characters quite a bit and even went back to re-read it!"
1,This book was not for me...,"This book is not for me. The premise of the book is to reduce cravings by eating a particular flavor in all of your meals throughout the day. For example, the flavor of the day may be pineapples. With your breakfast, you will have pineapple juice. Your midmorning snack will be pineapple yogurt. Lunch includes pineapple chicken salad. Dinner includes pineapple shrimp and dessert also has fresh pineapple or pineapple rings. Each day has a theme such as raisins, lemon, peach, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, etc. This type of strict regiment is not something that I can maintain long term and the recipes are not convenient for most people with somewhat of a busy lifestyle. I would not recommend this book."
2,A disappointment,"The author develops his ideal diet based on the scientific evidence that we have the ability to sense various tastes, such as sweet, sour, bitter, etc. So far, so good. He then suggests that our brain has set points for these and if we eat one of the tastes, such as sweet, we have to keep eating this until the set point is satisfied. Maybe. Where this falls apart in my mind is his dietary suggestions, supposedly evolved from the above observations. That is, such things as the peach diet, where the only consistency throughout is the ""peach"" with plenty of other opportunities for sour, bitter, savory set points being initiated. I consider this book largely just another reworking of other dietary books already available, with the slight twist of discussing taste as an issue, but not really following through with that so well."
1,Didn't work,"I tried this diet and it didn't work for me. Also, the daily meal preparation was a challenge at best, and many questions were not addressed or anticpated in the book. Even though I enjoyed the recipees, I was exhausted after a week of meal planning.I respect Dr katz very much normally, but this was, in the end, a recipee book."
5,Fascinating and readable,"Some readers might find some parts slow going, but this classic work remains an excellent introduction into how and why our understanding of the heavens (and ourselves) changed so radically following the work of Copernicus. Those interested in reading Kuhn's seminal and more famous ""The Stucture of Scientific Revolutions"" will enjoy reading ""Copernicus"" to see how his thinking grew from this earlier work."
4,gift,The Wellington boots were a present for my son. He was very delighted with them. They came in a very timely manner which delighted me as they were a Christmas present.
1,"DO NOT BUY, SAVE YOUR MONEY....Hunters are not what they were","These boots use to be manufactured in Scotland and were fantastice quality but are now made in China and Brazil.They are now terrible quality and will not last long. But don't just take my word for it, just put into Google ""Hunters poor quality""Also look at these sites to see what many others are saying.....Horse and Hound[...]Secret Scotland[...]My fiance bought me a pair of Hunters just 2 years ago and said that they would last for years. Both boots have developed cracks along the soles and are letting in water. It should also be noted that I do not wear them much. If they are used every day they may only last 6 months which is better as they have a 12 month guarantee!"
1,Beware if you are size 5,"I am the girl who has small feet. I wear size 4 woman. Since size 4 is very hard to find, I typically buy size 5 woman. And because of my small feet, I know very well about children sizes, because I can fit bid kids size 3.5. I ordered a woman size 5, but received a big kid size 4 boots with someone else's return label on it. Apparently, this seller is not honest with their products and wants to sell big kid shoes as woman shoes (the circumference of the boots are different). The big kid Hunters only sell for $75 at department stores."
1,Struggle,"I can't get these boots off. I always have to have someone around me to help to pull them off. For the price, I thought they were going to be fantastic. Live and learn."
1,Supposed to be rainboots ? Water still leak through!,"I bought my hunter boot at the mall not on amazon.I was very excited when I purchased the boot! It is very comfortable and look great!Today was heavy rain and felt a leak in the rainboots.I had only wore less than a month, for the first time I notice a leak in the rainboots, my socks were wet.I will return the boot tomorrow! I am very dissaapointed! Supposed to be rainboots and water proof!I do not recommend wearing them in a heavy rain!"
4,Classic Neal!,"I don't know why I waited so long to get this CD. I am a huge Neal fan, and have almost everything he's ever done. I could be wrong, but I believe this was his first solo album, and for some reason wasn't expecting much from it. I was pleasantly surprised as I found this a very enjoyable album and it is now one of my favorites. There are a few songs which are more simple and somewhat pop-style, but I even enjoyed those. The last song is the more complex, progressive style and true to Neal's nature, there's a lot going on there! For two weeks I couldn't get enough of this CD and played it over and over in my car. I highly recommend it!"
4,Prog pop,"Interesting pop with little mini-prog nuggets. Clever, ironic lyrics that made me laugh out loud at least three times on the first listen. Includes a 20+ minute prog piece at the end.The only significant problem is that Morse has bouncy, upbeat songs with depressing lyrics that don't match the music (Lost Cause). This is similar to Prince of the Power of the Air on Testimony."
4,Great Music,"Whoever said that Neal Morse was at his creative peak when he wrote this album was way off. V hadn't been released by the time this album came out. If you're what I so affectionately refer to as a ""prog snob"" then you may not like this album. As many have already said, it's more pop oriented. That having been said, it's really not AOR or radio friendly pop; but it is very well executed in true Neal Morse style.I think anyone who enjoyed Kindness of Strangers or (to a lesser extent) Day for Night would like this album.Neal Morse is the only man alive that I know of that writes ""Pop"" epics."
3,Flashes of Brilliance.,"This is the sort of disc reviewers love because the lyrics are clever and the musical influences are obvious and done with affection. Track #1 is obviously ""the single"" and its a gorgeous Todd Rundgren thing with a dash of Bruce Hornsby. That's the good news. After the first track, its a different album. The lyrics are very cool--mostly the ""I'm a loser with irony"" variety but the tunes are nothin' special. If you want to see what this guy can do may I recommend the astounding Spock's Beard album, ""V"""
5,"The Essence of Zen, in Five Acts","This is one of the most beautiful, profoundly moving films I've ever seen. An exquisite work of art, it makes maximum use of the delicate nuances of nature and the changing seasons, blending these nuances with the workings of the human heart to tell a simple story that sums up the essence of Zen. It presents the great tragedy of human existence, but so simply and beautifully that I found the story uplifting and optimistic, rather than depressing. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's a movie I'll watch again and again."
5,Master Piece,This movie captures all that is Zen. With very few words the movie takes over and the story unfolds for every viewer no matter their native language. A master piece of work!
5,Amazing,"As 17 year old youth who is fond of independant and foreign cinema, i have been dying to see ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring"" since i first heard about it a year ago. Lucky for me, they played this wonderous film on my satellite. Although i may not understand the meanings behind all of the religious allegories and symbolism, this film was nontheless amazing. I cannot explain to you everything, partially because i have no definitions of the religion that permiates the film, but what i do know is that we are all able to find the story of our own lives within this lush and beautiful fable."
5,"SIMPLE, BEAUTIFUL AND MEANINGFUL",This film is a wonderful art work. The film is situated at an idyllic place at an unreal time frame where everything is connected with a zen philosophical meaning. An excellent film to watch many times.
2,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winer...and Spring","If I knew the movie was going to be so boring, I would not have purchased it. I wasted $12 on it."
3,Not much here,"First the good. The film is beautifully shot. The scenic beauty is wonderful, and the cinematographer was very good at capturing moments that convey what was being said without dialogue most of the time. Hats off to him. Now for the bad. I don't know a lot about Buddhism, but I do know after reading a few of the reviews that it doesn't really follow Buddhism too closely. I also don't like the way the director is hitting us over the head with the symbolism. The most aggravating example of this was the final ""Spring"" segment when he kept showing the monk dragging a stone and cutting away to the animals dragging rocks. Pointless and unnecessary. We get it. You don't have to be so heavy handed. At least I was hoping for a good story, but even that was not realized. The story is simplistic and boring. I gave it three stars for the cinematography, otherwise it would have been 1 star."
3,A face changing film ...,"Although it is not clear and no one seems mention it, I think this is a story about grand pa, dad and son (Otherwise its hard to understand why the old monk burned himself, and the women covered her face).And this is not a Chinese film (as I thought before viewing), it's a Korean film.One thing I don't like is that 4 actors play a role representing different stages in life. It's a bit annoying; with each totally different face came into play, it made me wonder if this is a new person or the same person growing older?"
5,Most Thought Provoking Film,"When I first saw SSFW&S; in February 2009 (from the library), I was a little confused with the meaning of the ending. But the more I thought about it and slept on it, the more I understood, why. Had to buy the DVD. Absolutely wonderful sincere entertainment. This movie changes life's.In my top three films, along with: Life is Beautiful and, A Face in the Crowd."
3,Korean Culture film,"The cinematic view of the film was both beautiful and artfully done. If you are not familiar with Korean culture, you might find the movie strange. In the context of the culture, it is an entertaining film."
4,Valspar Tractor paint,"After Tractor Supply Company (TSC) chose to drop the Valspar paint line for Majestic Paint,(A bad choice as far as I'm concerned) I was in a jam as I was right in the middle of a refurbishing of a antique tractor. I needed Valspar Transport Yellow to match what I started with. Lucky to find the aresol spray cans on Amazon to touch up areas that I needed to finish and match the paint I started with. Valspar has been around for a long time with a great product. A name to trust."
5,Good Paint!,Good transaction! Needed paint to finish a project and I was emailed when product was available. Thank you very much!
1,Defective Spray Nozzle,"Needed this for equipment touch ups. Used 1/4 of can, spray nozzle stopped spraying , tried everything to unplug and gave up threw can away."
1,The LAST RAKOSH a giant ripoff,"I have read every F.Paul Wilson 'repairman Jack' novel. I usually find his books nice light reading. His last effort 'The LAST RAKOSH' is not a new book. All the author did was take his novel 'ALL THE RAGE', remove two thirds of the story and reprint the rest of it under a new title. Read the last page of both stories, they are identical. I paid $4.99 for the special edition of all the rage, nice price and a nice book. I then paid $14.95 to buy The LAST RAKOSH. What a giant ripoff. I really feel that Mr. Wilson and his publishers should be ashamed. So save your money and but All The Rage. Why waste your money on one third of the story. I think Mr. Wilson owes my $14.95 plus shipping!Mr. Wilson is lucky I don't know how to find Repairman Jack."
2,Be carefull what you buy!,"Take heed boys and girls this is not a new Work, or a long read. This book is only 94 pages of 20-font reading. I complained to F Paul Wilson and he replied that this was not a rip off and that collectors love this sort of stuff. Yah, but I am not a collector and I do not appreciate spending $20.00 for a 15 min read. I do not blame Mr. Wilson but I do blame Publishing houses that try to sell short stories at full novel prices. The price of books is already too high as it is.Nuff Said"
1,Save Your Money,"What a rip-off! This book was advertised as an all new novel from F. Paul Wilson but all you get is 94 pages of previously published material. This story was either an earlier short story of taken from ""All The Rage"" and doesn't come close to being worth the $20.00 asking price. I am a big F. Paul Wilson fan but he should be ashamed for taking advantage of his readers. I thought when I bought this book that it was a continuation of this story and not just a reprint of previous material. Shame on F. Paul and Amazon!"
1,This is only one Chapter out of 'All The Rage' dont buy it! Not worth $14.95,"'The LAST RAKOSH' is a chapter from 'ALL THE RAGE' . All the author did was take his novel 'ALL THE RAGE', reprint one chapter of it under a new title 'The LAST RAKOSH' . they are identical. I paid $4.99 for the special edition of all the rage and paid $14.95 to buy this book and I feel that I was ripped off. Buy 'ALL THE RAGE' instead of 'The LAST RAKOSH' and you will be be a lot better off. Don't buy this book"
4,"It is a reprint, but a fine one at that","I just read The Last Rakosh by F. Paul Wilson. It is a Repairman Jack short story and one of the finest as it features the Bengali Demons that were featured so prominently in Jack's Freshman outing ""The Tomb"".Monster's don't get more horrifying than this and Wilson's writing is slick and fast paced.Yes, the price was a bit steep for a large print novella and others complained that the story was a rehash of key scenes from Wilson's 4th Jack novel ""All the Rage"".The truth of the matter is that this is the short story that was written before ""All the Rage"" and was for the longest time unavailable as a stand alone piece. Wilson incorporated this yarn into ""Rage"" so that his fans could finally read the story.I for one am pleased to get my hands on anything written by F. Paul Wilson,including this little story. If you are looking for a new story this one is not for you, but for die-hard fans of the masters works this is one not to be missed."
1,Wilson should be ashamed!,"I am a big Repairman Jack fan. I'm always on the lookout for his next novel and was excited to order this one.I was surprised at how thin the book was. I was evem more surprised when I found I apparently ordered the large print edition with the special, giant margin art.The biggest shock of all came when I realized I've read this story before!Sure, the publisher thought this was a great idea, but Mr. Wilson had to approve it and rewrite the story. I'm really disappointed, enough said."
4,research,"For all those spitting curses at FPW be aware that if you go to his website, he expressly says ""if you already read All the Rage then you have read the Last Rakosh and there is no need to buy this version. I was astonished to have received an email response from FPW himself when I was just getting into these novels and he is very honest and forthcoming with his novels. So do some research before you spend money and stop cursing those who have not truly done you any injustice."
1,Was I Ripped Off?,"When I ordered this book I was very excited about reading a new Repairman Jack novel. I PAID for a novel but I got a very short story, almost in children's form. It took about an hour to read it. The cost was over 20 dollars, which I don't mind paying for a real book,which this was not.Next time I will pay more attention to the number of pages."
1,The Last Rakosh,"The book was presented beautifully, nice cover, nice pages, however, I have read all of the Repairman Jack novels and was extremely disappointed when I found The Last Rakosh was nothing more than a few chapters taken out of the book Conspiracies. I expected so much more than that. I feel I paid $30 for nothing."
2,I Wish I Had Read the Reviews Before Buying!,"I am a great F. Paul fan, particularly the Repairman Jack series. I was so pleased to see a new novel that I let my finger do the buying...in haste. I was pretty surprised when that thin volume arrived, let me tell you! Yes, the printing is attractive, but come now, a $30 retail price for an 80 some page book? And then, worse than that, it was not a new story, just a fleshed out one from another novel. I will be more careful in the future.... I don't blame the author, just the publisher."
1,The Last Rakosh,"This is a rip off. This is word for word taken from the middle of another book he wrote previously. This is the last F Paul Wilson Book I will ever purchase. There ought to be laws against plagarizing your own self. This $15 book is an excerpt from his previous novels. It is 93 pages of large type that would be 40 pages of normal text and it adds nothing to the story line. It is just repeating what was already written in his previous work. This is scum - if there was a rank for zero stars, I would have used it."
1,shame on you fpw,"They say there's a sucker born every minute and I guess I just joined that club. The Last Rakosh is a complete waste of money no matter how much you pay for it. Expecting a new and exciting Repairman Jack tale, what I got was a retelling, almost an exact excerpt from a previous RJ novel! Nothing new, nothing exciting, just a waste of money. Spare yourself the dissappointment and read the original novel that this is culled from. Even the cover art sucks, the rakosh not looking nearly as deadly or ferocious as I imagined, more like a koala bear with teeth."
4,Does what it says for cheap,"I play a lot of tennis and tend to snap strings like crazy. Since I don't mind stringing, I use this stuff. It's easier on my elbow than Kevlar and has a decent feel to it. The really nice thing about it is that it's dirt cheap."
1,"season 4, every disc freezes up.","Great show, but every single disc for season four freezes up. It also appears to have been copied from the television broadcast. There's a brief spot after some episodes where the next show is announced. Lots of money to spend on crappy quality. And I got it as a gift for my spouse."
4,of the celluloid persuasion,"Peter Thomas' brilliant soundtrack creation is highlighted in this swell edition of his life's work. These songs taken out of the context of the film in which they appeared makes for the most swinging bizarre listening experience imaginable. Say, you like Portishead, Medeski, Martin and Wood, and Stereolab, you must purchase this CD. This is what the _Vampires_Lesbos_ soundtrack wanted to be.I'll leave you with a quote from track 11, ""Monsters, Monsters, Monsters! """
4,Good music,"Good music for someone who has watched the film for which the music was composed. In particular, ""Erinnerungen an die Zukunft"" or ""Strange gods from strange planets"" from the famous 70's documentary ""Chariots of the gods"". Peter Thomas is a great composer."
3,As was expected,"As was expected from description and pictures. Arrived quickly and in time for christmas. Have not installed it yet, but the plans seem simple enough."
1,Not like the photo.,I ordered the item in the photo. It looks like an outdoor canopy with canvas or plastic top and four legs. I got a mosquito net you hang over a bed. Item is misrepresented in the photo.
2,"Wpnderful design, terrible execution","The design of this is outstanding, unfortunately execution is terrible. The unit I purchased came in with the top shelf broken at the miter joints due to poor cut 45 degree angles and the use of a sub par quality of glue (typical in Chinese assembled furniture) with too short stables to hold the corner. The unit was assemble in such a way that the plant light could not be connected at the fixture which required the relocation of the fixture.The design is such that I felt is was worth my time to properly assemble, particularly after receiving no reply to my communication to the manufacturing company. I could have of course returned to Amazon, but thought the unit was salvageable. Hopefully some one will correct the contract manufacturer.Do not buy unless you have significant woodworking skills to correct errors. Some errors such as bad joint angle cutting can not be corrected."
5,It's a big medal ball,"Well, there isn't much i can say because well it's a big medal ball, and that's about it, it does exactly what it was made to do. Oh ya, it also came in the color blue which was an unexpected surprise."
1,Carafe Handle Broke After A Few Months of Use!,"I love the smallness of this unit, particularly as I am the only coffee-drinking person in the household! It is simple to use and easy to clean. Great for a quick morning coffee!However I was very disappointed after purchasing this some months ago when the handle of the carafe became 'unattached', making it but unusable. I unsuccessfully tried many times to reattach it, which didn't work.I have since purchased another brand - A beautiful Cooks brand from JC Penney on sale. Hopefully more luck with this one!"
2,"Why Mr. Coffee, why?","How to ruin a perfectly fine four cup coffee maker:1) Change the carafe, make it so you cannot clean it by making the mouth small, make it fragile with thin glass, make the handle pop off2) Make it so you cannot see where four cups are on the carafe.This WAS a decent, cheap coffeemaker, not anymore. They changed the design, who knows why, now its junk."
4,Great but missing filter...,"I just got this coffee maker. Haven't used it yet but I assume it will work perfectly fine. I will say that from the reviews it sounded like there was a permanent filter that came with it so I didn't order one but when I got the maker, there was no filter.I was looking forward to making my first cup of coffee this weekend but now I have to put it off a week since I ordered a permanent filter online. FYI, I went to 4 different stores looking for a 4 cup permanent coffee filter and I could find one, so save yourself the trouble and order one online with this coffee maker."
3,Mines odd,"My mr.coffee seems to take 4 cups of water, but only brews about 2 cups, the rest gets steamed away. and takes a long time, around 15 - 20 minutes just for that.Think mine is malfunctioning.Little better coffee then my last maker,"
3,Mixed up order,"I ordered a White Mr Coffee. I received a Black Mr Coffee. Supposed to have a permanent filter. There was none. I was unable to return it to the PO because of a disability so I used it with my old filter. It works fine as all Mr Coffees usually do. But I can't help thinking it was a return. I would have liked to have a white one because the coffee stains show up on white and they are not easy to see on black.If you ask me if I like the Mr Coffee, I do, but never again through the mail."
2,Good size but not well designed,"I wanted a small coffee pot and this one fills the bill. However, it has design issues. It is very difficult to put the top back on the carafe after it has been washed, I always spill coffee when removing the carafe from the unit, and it often drips when I pour. I would not recommend this product."
2,DOA,"When I got this, it arrived DOA. Since the final destination was the Bahamas, it would cost me 3 time the replacement to send it back. Taking the bottom off, it was discovered that one of the power leads was not well connected to the slider terminal on the on/off buttom. That is lousy QC on Mr. Coffee's part. I can fix it. Maybe it is time for American firms to enhance there QC at thier offshore plants or bring back to the States to Manufactor"
5,Pleased With Purchase,"Product works great, it takes up less counter space and works just as great as the larger size coffee makers. I should have bought one sooner."
4,It is ok,It works. But not very convinent as my old Mr. coffee 4-cup. It is really hot when working. It will make a lot of vapor when finished. But the size is perfect.
5,Little Coffee Pot,"This little 4-cup coffee cup far surpasses others I have had in the past by other manufacturers. It is very good looking and is SO easy to use, from filling the water to placing the coffee in its compartment. There is nothing awkward about doing either, as I found in the past with other coffee makers. And the coffee does not burn when some is left in the carafe; it is piping hot - perfect."
2,"Not so great, but...","Two twelve ounce cups of coffee require 25 or 26oz of water, but the vent hole in the rear of the TF5 water tank reservoir limits you to 22oz maximum. Plugged the hole with a tire patch. Go figure..."
5,Great investment for a 2 cup of coffee,"I am so happy that I purchased this coffee maker. I am the only one that drinks coffee in the house and this is a quick coffee maker and easy to use. It is a cute little coffee maker that serves a excellent purpose and it does not take up alot of space on my kitchen counter. I recommend this to people that just want to make a quick cup or two of coffee and that makes not mess, it also pours out easily with no spills.....Great coffee maker...."
1,Good coffee - poorly made decanter,The decanter handle would not clip to the decanter rim after ~6 months of use (hand washed). After searching the web and local stores I discovered that the best price for the decanter is $15.99. On-line prices are better but S/H is way too high. At $15.99 this is ~70% of the cost of the whole unit. Don't purchase this unit!
3,Does it's job!!,"I bought this small coffee maker for my office. Perfect size for me. The only complain I have is the coffee does not taste as good and tastes little burnt. I have a 12-cup coffee maker and by comparison, I feel this coffee maker does not do it's job as well as the other one."
2,4 cup description is misleading,Not sure what 4 cup measure they were using but must have been a demi-tasse. Way too small. I returned it.
5,Cutest coffee maker,"For those who live alone or with +1, I would really recommend it! It is small, doesn't take much space in the kitchen, cute and makes the coffee you need! Did I say cute, yes, very cute."
2,Tasted strange,"The only difference between this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker and the one I bought and returned was mine said 5 cups. It worked perfectly, didn't drip or spill or spit, made 3 1/2 cups of coffee with 5 tbl spoons of coffee to 4 cups water. But it tasted like plastic. I tried 5 times to make coffee that tasted like coffee and never did. Other people had problems with the machine itself, I just couldn't drink the weird tasting stuff that came out of it."
5,Mr. Coffe 4-cup is great,I made my first cup of coffee today. It came out perfectly. No plastic taste like others have said. Easy to rinse out. 3 cups on their scale wound up being 1-1/3 cups to drink. So I would make 4 cups to get a good 2 cups. But that's all I need and I'm happy with it.
4,Great Coffee Maker,"This coffee maker is great for me. I have limited counter space and my husband and I only drink one mug of coffee in the morning. I only knocked off a star because it states that it comes with a reusabler filter and it doesn't. TheMr. Coffee TF5GTF 4-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, Black with Gold Tone Filtercomes with the filter."
2,Not good,"It smells strange when it works...Maybe that's because of the plastic, anyway,I can't use it to make coffee... the coffee tastes strange.."
3,"When you have no coffee, it will make it for you","Simple, small, easy, coffee. Spring loaded basket so you can have your coffee mid-stream, even FASTER! No clock, no timer, no fancy stuff like that, but by God, it....makes.....coffee.Coffee not included, this review is void if next week it breaks, but until then coffee..."
1,Bad Design,"This is the poorest design of a coffeepot I have ever seen in my over 50 years of drinking coffee.The lid opens up to vertical which interferes with the pot when filling the unit. And if that is not enough, if you overfill the unit, there is a hole in the back of the unit where the water runs out onto your counter."
5,Not much of a travel toilet...but it makes a great pot of coffee!,I bought this as a travel toilet for those times when traffic gets backed up on I5 and I really have to pee. My husband kept laughing at me and telling me there's another use for it. Lo and behold! This thing makes coffee! Who would've guessed it? It makes the most fabulous coffee and right quick too. Don't know much about them here thingamijiggs cause I aint had no schoolhousin' but WOWIE would I ever recommend these to all of y'all! Go and get yerself one right quick!
3,keep it simple,"Disaster struck this morning when my 20+ year-old 4-cup Mr. Coffee died. Other cleaning and replacing a (cheap) carafe, it has produced thousands of delicious cups of coffee over the years. Did I really want to throw it out and order a new unknown model coffee maker.I charged over to Ace Hardware, who had a switch that was an identical replacement for less than [...] bucks and I'm back in business.I hope to get another 20 years out of it."
3,Picture size is misleading,"I was shocked when I received this to see how tiny this carafe is. It's as small as any regular cup of coffee. The picture of the carafe next to a cup of coffee is very misleading--that would have to be a tiny espresso cup in the picture rather than a regular coffee cup. I must not have read carefully enough and let the picture mislead me on the size. Nevertheless, I'm not unhappy with the purchase because I prefer to make less coffee. This small machine might help me cut down on wasted coffee as larger machines seem to inspire brewing more than I can drink and throwing away half a pot each day."
3,"Small, but cute","I bought this a a Christmas gift, and though it is small, it does make coffee. Trying to figure out the right measurement to make it not bitter though!"
1,Money Saver,A $19 coffee maker is a $19 coffee maker. It is much flimsier than I expected. Easily qualifies as a $9 coffee maker!Save you money! Purchase a $20 coffee maker. LOL
4,Good coffee maker,"My only complaint is that it is a bit noisy for a little guy, other than that it makes a good hot cup of coffee and I recommend you purchase a permanent coffee filter, since it does not come with one."
4,My Mr Coffee Maker,Being the only coffee drinker in the house. This little coffee pot is just perfect for me. It brews great tasting coffee and takes very little space on the countertop. It is also quite attractive sitting on the counter.
3,broke after 7 months...,"I got this from my mom for my birthday and it lasted me 7 months, which is a good thing and all, but I was hoping for it to last me, at least, 2 years. I'm not sure why it decided to up and break on me, but it no longer pumps water to the coffee grounds. I went to clean it thinking something was up in the hose and it wouldn't pump still, I think the suction died or something. Not really fond of the idea of sticking my hand in there while it's turned on. I'm not sure about other people but I can't afford to go around buying coffee makers every few months. I very much loved this little thing while it lasted so I'm not about to give it a 1 or 2 star rating, but it ran kind of slow and made a gurgling noise while it worked, which I understand coffee pots gurgle, but this was just LOUD, and it didn't last me very long at all. So there's my 3 star rating."
5,Good sturdy simple coffee maker,This is the second one I bought. The first one lasted more than 5 years of every day use. I expect this to last long also. No frills but that makes it sturdy and reliable.
4,Great Coffee Maker,Makes two to three cups of coffee and works fast and efficiently. The only gripe I have is that the basket is smaller than conventional 8-cup coffee makers and I have problems finding the paper filters for the smaller 4-cup basket.
1,The heat plate grows rusty within few month,"Two years ago, I brought it and like it. I drink coffee in the morning, so only used it only once a day. Six month after I brought it, its heat plate started growing rusty. I continuely used it for additional six month when the 50% heat plate was rusted. I thought it was an incidence, so I threw it away and brought the same model again. Nine month late, 20% heat plate is rusted.... This time I don't think it is a incidence again."
5,Luv This Little Coffee Pot,Perfect little coffee pot for 1-2 people. On the 4 cup setting it makes the perfect amount for 1 live cup and fills my thermos for the day. Works simply and quickly. Doesn't take up much counter space either. I especially like the black color.
4,simple coffee maker,I have used this coffee maker twice now - seems to work fine although the top does not close all the way. But for $12 it is perfect!
5,This one's just right.,"I got this as a gift from my mother after she heard me complain about the coffee maker I had (another brand). This Mr. Coffee model is half the price of my old one, and I like it much, much better. It's small, easy to use, easy to clean, and makes good coffee. Perfect for one or two people."
4,Nice coffee pot,"This is a nice coffee maker at a great price. Brews good coffee. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is pot itself. Even thought the plastic lid comes off for cleaning, the opening is so small that it is really hard to get in there to clean it. It's like trying to clean the inside of a coke bottle. The older style 4 cup Mr. Coffee's had a huge opening that made cleaning a breeze. Why they changed it is beyond me. I guess the newer design looks better but it doesn't function better. Overall though, I give it a positive score."
2,Quick Disappointment,"After a few years of very satisfied daily usage, I had to replace my previous Mr. Coffee 4-cup maker due to leakage. I replaced it with this new version, which has easy pouring both in the maker and out the pot. But the pot hole at the top is much smaller than the previous one, making it hard to wash the inside by hand. I then tried using a brush and the glass pot easily broke off at the top. Now I have a brand new coffee maker without a pot. I'm back to shopping for a new coffee maker after only two uses from this one."
4,Great little pot,"I purchased this coffee maker to keep at my desk at work. It makes 2 mugs of coffee in under 10 minutes. The coffee tastes good and it's very convenient. I gave it 4 stars because all the parts are made of plastic, excpet the carafe and I've become very conscious when buying items that come in contact with my food. I wish maufacturers would use less plastics."
1,My 4 cup coffee maker stopped making good coffee after 3 months of use.,"This coffee maker started out working fine, but after three months there is something wrong with the way it is brewing... it is sending water through the thing too quickly or something, and half of the grounds inside the filter remain dry. Water just goes right through it for a weak brew no matter how much coffee you use. I'm tired of this capitalist system that supports crappy products that break."
3,Note: that's 4-5oz cups of coffee,"I realize this may be standard practice for coffee pot marketing but i bought this expecting 4-8 oz cups (i.e. 32 oz) of capacity. No where in the product description does it say that in this particular context, a cup is 5 liquid oz. Pretty much the entire developed world (i.e. the US, Liberia, and Burma) understands a liquid cup to be 8 oz., and to just redefine that unit of measurement willy-nilly is inexcusable. And besides, what sense does a 5 oz cup even make in the context of coffee? 5 oz is a serving for a dog or a small child of some sort. An adult has no possible use for 5 oz of coffee, except possibly as a 'top off'. So please, Amazon, just call it what it is. A Mr. Coffee 4-Top Offs Switch Coffemaker.Also note, if the pot is to be stored in plain view it will need to be turned around backwards since it resembles a demented cycloptic cyborg when viewed from certain angles."
4,Works Well,"I bought this little coffee maker to save money on going out and buying drip coffee. I figured that it'll save me about $30/mo. The coffee maker is little, but perfect for one person. There's a trick to get the brew like the drip coffee at shops. Buy premium coffee, and let the water heat up for a few minutes before it touches the coffee. I kept the lid open for about 3-4mins and let the water heat up real good before i put down the lid and that seemed to make the coffee more rich."
2,Looks good until it drips and splatters during pause and pour,"Great size, nice design, aesthetically. But it drips onto the warming plate every time that you make it pause to pour during brewing, which gradually erodes the surface of that plate and makes the carafe stick to it. It often splatters when you pour from the carafe even after brewing stops. So you end up with coffee splatters all over the coffeemaker and counter. Best alternative: Look for one of the discontinued Krups models on eBay. Brand new ones show up occasionally, even. You'll pay the original, new cost ($40), but they're the only 4-cup models that ever worked fully, without drips and spatters, of the 3 or 5 brands that I've tried."
1,"Worked once, Never again","Not sure why. Mr Coffee is a reputable brand but this one just doesn't work. I'm in the process of returning it. Brewed one pot but the next day didn't brew anything! Cleaned it, read directions, etc... nothing"
3,good but Not so durable-,"I've had MR. Coffee- 4cup little over a year now. My boy friend and I have put it to good use during the year, making coffee about 4-5 times a week. However, about 4 months ago the plastic handle piece seperated from the glass cup. We were still able to make coffee but it was a big inconvenience. Then about 3 weeks ago, the machine had trouble pumping water from the tank to the filter. I guess we made good use of the machine for a year but still a bit disappointed the we had to buy a new one only a year after we bought Mr. Coffee 4-cup."
4,Steady and true.,"We have had this coffee maker for years. It's still running strong. We have gone through several coffee makers all costing over $70, this was the most inexpensive one and has lasted the longest. The draw backs are brewing time (which isn't horrible) and it drips from the pot while you pour the first cup. All in all great for the price. I have had other makers that are faster and make a better cup of coffee but not by that much."
3,Quality not as good as older Mr. Coffee models,"This coffee maker is ok for $15, but the older models were made better. For instance, the plastic seems cheaper and not as durable. The design of the opening of the pot makes it harder to clean. The opening isn't as wide as the older model. I have small hands and I can barely get my hand in it to clean it. The part where you pour the water is narrower, so you have to be more careful when filling it. Bottom line, it still makes a good cup of coffee but it isn't as user friendly as the old one and the quality leaves a lot to be desired."
1,Poorly Designed,"The carafe is poorly designed and it's nearly impossible to pour a cup of coffee without spilling. The same holds true if you use the carafe to fill the water reservoir. When removing the carafe to pour a cup of coffee during brewing, the maker drips onto the hot-plate causing burning on the plate - contrary to what the manufacturer declares. The cover needs to be closed to keep the coffee basket from pushing up when you place the carafe under the drip maker. We purchased this for our camper. When we realized how much of a mess it created to make a couple cups of coffee, we put our house coffee maker in the camper. It's messy and not worth the time for a couple cups of coffee. I recommend looking for something other than this model."
5,Great product !,"It is easy and convenient to lift the lid and place the filter. Of course, putting coffee into the filter is easy, too! Cleaning the unit is simple."
4,Just Right,"Pros: This is a simple, fast brewing little coffee maker, just right for a couple of mugs of coffee. Its compact on your counter, easy to fill the water reservoir, load the filter and coffee, and it has a bright green light up front to remind you its on.A few cons: No auto shut off, some spillage pouring coffee but not if you're adaptable and don't rush, mine did not come with a reusable filter (the other reviews confused me because some mentioned it did).This no frills machine makes a good cup of coffee, and its a nice replacement after my fancy Cuisinart that got such good reviews then died like everyone else's after less than a year."
2,Leaks,The lid on this product leaks when you pour your coffee. Would not recommend. It will annoy you. Better to pay more and get the other product.
3,A bit small...,The coffee cup on the picture should not be used as a size comparison. This is a very small coffee maker.
5,Perfect for one person.,"I'm a single gal, and I need a simple coffee maker for when I want 1-2 cups. Not good for dinner parties or more than 2 persons, this is the size of a mini coffee maker that you'd find in hotels. Otherwise it's great.Note, it does not have automatic shutoff, it does not have a clock/timer, or other features. But its a straightforward coffee maker and thats what I needed."
1,POS = DOA,"Ordered as a gift. Dead out of the box. Recipient called Mr. Coffee direct and they told him they would send a replacement out within a week, but I'm not happy about the product being dead out of the box. Hope to have better luck with the replacement."
1,did not heat up coffee,This was a poor product as the heating element did not heat the water enough as it poured over the grinds. Nor did the plate keep the coffee hot. It was a waste of money and we left it on the cruise ship for the staff. (We brought it to make coffee in our cabin since ship coffee sucks)
3,"Some good ideas--but could use a ""grammar/functions index""","There are some good, easy to use ideas in this book, but you have to go through it one page at a time to find out what function or grammar is to be practiced in each game. On a positive note, the activities are divided into language level. The games I have used in the classroom, have been a success with the students."
1,I ordered Loafer and received Sandals,"I ordered the loafer and got the sandals. I will keep the sandals, they are not bad, but I won't order from Propet again."
2,"I ordered loafers, received sandals","The sandals are okay, not terrific, too much of a hassle to return. Probably won't order again."
2,Also ordered Loafer and received Sandals,Propet Women's Comfy Walker LoaferI also purchased the loafers for $34.90 but received sandals instead. Must be a mixup with the photo/item number. Easy return process by printing pre-paid return label. Original shipping charges also to be refunded.
1,Do NOT Read This Book,"A few years ago, we read this book in class. We had literary circles that we read it in. Our group was assigned this book, The Cabin Faced West, and we despised it with a passion. This book lacks a plot, and is one of the most boring books that I have ever read. I am an avid reader, and this is perhaps one of the few books that I have ever disliked. Not only am I surprized at the number of people who have posted good reviews on this book, I am also surprized at the number of people who actually take their time to read this trash. Whatever you do, DO NOT read this book. It is a waste of your time."
1,The Cabin Faced West,"The Cabin Faced West is about a girl who moved to the frontier in the 1700's. When Ann ( the main character) moves to the west she doesn't like it one bit. She says there is no one but boys to play with, and you ""can't"" play with boys. But she meets a kid named Andy who she educates. Later she meets a young man named Arthur Scott, who talks about General George Washington that ends up actually coming. Meanwhile ""THE STORM"" happens. this was a favored part by me. Something for you to look forward to would be the pictures; they have lots of detail. It is based on a true story, but there isn't much excitement, and I don't like it being based mostly on a female character. There are lot's of dramatic scenes, which I consider rather boring. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction."
1,Am I the only one who hated A Cabin Faced West?,"I read this book in 3rd grade and still remember how long, slow and boring it really is."
1,The Book Review of the Cabin Faced West,The Cabin Faced West is about a girl named Anne Hamilton. who just moved west from Gettysburg. She misses her friends and her old life. A man named Arthur Scott comes. She has a tea party. Her brothers make up THE RULE. There is a big storm. General Washington comes.I liked some things in this book. I liked the big storm. I did because some bad things happened. I didn't like the book because there wasn't enough action. I would recommend this book to people who like history books.
1,The Cabin Faced West,"TheCabin Faced West is a story with the main character being a girl on the frontier. The girls name is Ann Hamilton. Ann had to leave Gettysburg and her cousin behind. Soon she is offered too leave but says no. In different part there is a large storm, and Ann takes all her peas in the cabin so they could live . I liked the storm because there is some excitement. But, I did not like that everyone was perfect. Arthur Scott should be a horse theif or someone should die. I would recommend this book to an older person who likes the western frontier and some history. I also recommend this book too someone who liked the Little House on the Prarie."
3,The Cabin Faced West,"The Cabin Faced WestThe Cabin Faced West was about a young girl named Ann Hamilton that moved west from Gettysburg during the western expension. Ann teaches a boy named Andy McPhale who has no education at all. In the beginning Ann's brothers David and Daniel make up a RULE but you don't know who will break it until the end.Ann misses her cousin from Gettysburg very much. She also misses her school, her friends, and Gettysburg.I liked the part when Ann meet someone very important from the Revolutionary War. I also liked when Ann found she could go somewhere but after a storm hits she decides finally.Last, I liked when Ann fell in LOVE at the very end.I did not like when all the excitement came at the end. The very important person comes from the war, when someone special comes,and when Ann fell in LOVE. I would recommend this book to someone that loves to read things about history or someones life."
3,pionner days,hi i like this book alot in the story ann and her family moved from gettysburg to hamilton hill in the story ann lives with her mom and dad and her 3 brothers i hope u like what u read in this book there are lots of surpries in this book i hope u like it
2,FACED WEST,"THE BOOK THE CABIN FACED WEST IS ABOUT A GIRL NAMED ANN WHO MOVES FROM GETTYSBURG TO WESTERN MARYLAND. THERE ANN EXPERIENCES GOOD AND BAD THINGS. SOME EXPERIENCES ARE WHEN ANN MEETS GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON AND WHEN ANN LOSES HER MOST PRIZED POSSESSION,HER DIARY. PROBABLY HER MOST EXCITING EXPERIENCE ANN HAS HAD IS MEETING ARTHUR SCOTT. ARTHUR SCOTT IS A VERY KIND MAN. I RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO: PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE OLDEN DAYS OR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE A LOT OF ACTION IN BOOKS OR MAYBE PEOPLE WHO CAN UNDERSTAND THINGS WHEN THEY AREN'T VERY WELL EXPLAINED. THAT IS ABOUT THE BOOK THE CABIN FACED WEST."
5,I think this would be the best book to read.,I think this would be a good book for 4thgraders to read because it teaches a lotabout the west.My favorite part was when Ann married ArthurScott because it sounded interesting.
1,Stinker,"Found this book trite and the authors self-absorbed. The case examples, especially Miranda, were obnoxious to read about. Pop-self-help books like this are embarrassing. On page 14:""... young women turn to marriage as source of safety, a harbor from a chaotic upbringing or a confusing adult world..."" This certainly does not say much for the women in question.I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Traditional Dispensationalism Clearly Presented,"Chafer presents a traditional dispensational interpretation of the kingdom. He argues that Jesus came at his first advent to offer Israel the kingdom promised in the OT, that the offer was rejected by the nation of Israel and therefore postponed to the second advent of Christ. The teaching of Jesus previous to the cross (e.g. the Sermon on the Mount) was the presentation of a kingdom ethic that is not relevant in today's age of grace.I don't agree with Chafer, but the book is well-written, clear and concise, and helpful to anyone seeking to understand the early 20th century dispensational understanding of the ""Kingdom of Heaven."""
1,Chisel Set,"The chisels were hardly sharp at all, despite advertising that they were already sharpened."
4,"And the winner, for worst SPIDER title - the envelope please","With a title this bad, you know the story has to be good. THE SPIDER is out-of-town fighting bad guys again, with the usual twists and turns to the plot, and two bonus short stories from the 1930's to boot."
2,Not so Light,"I purchased this book because the Broadway production of the title story had proved so enchanting. Don't be mistaken, though. The play bears little resemblance to the story. The story tries so hard to be symbolic and airy that the characters become cardboard symbols and I did not find myself caring much for any of them. The story may have proved more engaging had I not been expecting beauty and life to match what I had seen onstage, but as it was, I couldn't bring myself to read the rest of the stories."
4,Solid Graves era album,"Good album from the Micheal Graves era.In my opinion, Danzig is still the ultimate frontman for the misfits,However, Graves does a great job with the vocals and this album has a nice lyrical range."
4,"Somewhat dissapointing followup, but good nonetheless","Okay, before you dismiss this 4 star review of this album as something written by a clueless kid who probably doesn't even know who Glenn Danzig is, lets get something straight: I lov old Misfits, they are my favorite band. And yes, I did avoid this at first, but I was willing to open my mind., and I found out that Misfits, old or new, totally ROCK!However, I was somewhat dissapointed with my purchase. The songs just aren't as catchy as they were on ""American Psyco"". Which isn't to say that this album is without it's moments. The unbelievably catchy ""Forbidden Zone"" and ""Die Monster Die"", the wonderfully emotional ""Saturday Night"", and of course, the classics: ""Scream"" And ""Helena"" are some of the best nu-Misfits songs ever recorded.If you are just getting into the nu-Misfits, pick up ""American Psyco"", and if you like that, get this and ""Project 1950"". If you don't, just go back to kissing Danzigs ass."
5,Classic!,"The Misfit's Famous Monsters is not the type of album that you can be pretentious about. It's not some sort of 'spiritual' experience that will change your life. Some want albums that represent ""good taste"" and are musical escargo. I want something that really tastes good. I want good music that's as enjoyable as good sex. Sure sex isn't high brow, but it is fun. So is this CD! It makes me scream at the top of my lungs and have the time of my life. Joy thy name is Misfits."
4,its still the misfits,"all of you people saying that the misfits are nothing without danzig are right danzig was the father of the misfits. while he was there i admit they were better than now like on Earth AD mommy, can i go out and kill tonight, green hell all that stuff. when i listened to american psycho it only had like 3 good songs. then famous monsters came out and its alot better they had improved from american psycho.who cares if danzig left u can still listen to him in his band or buy an old misfits cd.feind 4 life."
3,review,"i'm one of those people that are so obcessed with the misfits, that it's basiclly all i listen to. I bought this cd not knowing any damn thing about it. It has it's share of bad and good songs...such as crawling eye, and scarecrow man, both annoying as hell i always have to skip those, but then it has it's decent ones like helena, and hunting humans. Just like any album it has it's flaws, i say you'd have to hear it for yourself"
2,Massive Disappointment,"I actually really dug ""American Psycho"", but this album just falls flat. There's probably three good songs, and most of the other ones are fairly mediocre. There are a few that are just terrible. Take ""Pumpkin Head"", for instance-[bad] lyrics (for a [bad] movie, I may add), the vocals sound weak (except for on the refrain), and the guitar sounds like a thrown-out Venom riff. I suggest checking out the Brickbats instead!"
5,Graves blows danzig away,"this newest album completely blows the last one away and proves what i knew then, michale graves is a much better singer than glenn ever was with the misfits. every song is a good and at its best it stands up to any classic, like ""skull"" go buy this!!!"
4,New Misfits rock,"This album was my first introduction to the misfits. At first listen i was dissapointed, but after hearing it a few times i have grown to love it. This group is not Danzig and does not want to be. It appeals to non punk music fans and thats a plus. I am now going to buy American Psyco and have an awesome collection of horror tunes. I never cared for mr danzigs voice so this new version of the misfits is just what i needed to turn me on to the misfits sound. Die hard fans will complain, but new fans will rejoice that the misfits live."
1,This is a joke right?,C'mon. Glen Danzig is the Misfits. Danzig wrote every Misfits song. But who the hell is this band? It says the Misfits but it is not. Its imposters. Anyone buying this album is a poser. This is the worst thing i have ever heard.
5,The best Misfits ablum to date!!,"I heard alot of mixed feelings about their new CD ""Famous Monsters"". I personally thinks that it's the best album that they have available.I loved ""American Physco"" also,so I couldn't wait to buy their new album.I took it home and listen to it track by track.It definatly gave me this very creepy feeling that I get everytime I had listened to ""American Physco"". But this album gets put in my tape player in my car,and it stays there until i've listened to every second.I can't get enough.I thinks it's without a doubt better than ""American Physco"",although that album is still great."
3,Misfits Unleashed,"Some might say the Misfits haven't been the same since Danzig left, well that's very true. On the new album ,the Misfits seem to have beefed up the ""Metal"" aspect and left behind alot of the ""punk for punk sake"" sound. This album isn't going to change the face of music, but it's a ton of fun. I've loved these guys since I was 14, and I still keep loving them. All good Fiends will love this. Enjoy."
4,Jerry Only still kix and pretty good for micheal graves,I'm really diggin it...My hero Jerry Only pulls it off again with pulse pounding bass riffs that make you want to get up and hurt somebody. It still sounds like the good old misfits we've all come to love 'cept michael graves is growin on me. I'm still not sure about his voice but his lyrics are still danzig-esque. Its a great twist on the old style misfits.
2,Graves SUCKS,"If your a new listener to The Misfits then buy there older music it's a hole hell lot better then this album and American Psycho. It's not that The Misfits suck, it's Graves on vocals that suck's. Only, Doyle, and Chud kick ass at what they do. But The Misfits were killer with Glenn Danzig then Graves. A few good song's on this album and that's it A FEW.20 YEARS OF TERRORFIENDS FOREVER"
3,Misfits - Back and... Scary!,"Pros:Easy to listen too, fun, catchyCons:repetitive, unoriginal.The Misfits are back, sort of. After resurrecting their careers with a comeback a few years back (without Glen Danzig of course) the Misfits have released another album, called ""Famous Monsters"". Along the lines of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween Hootenany"", the Misfits' new album is all about scary monsters and stuff. The music, well, is a bit repetitive unfortunately . The sound is a mix between heavy metal, hard rock and punk, and actually the group does a good job of not fitting into one stereotype, but they do it track after track, and simply put, some are better than others. Mellow Metal fans and slower punk fans will love this album, and I particularly liked the track ""Die Monster Die"". In general, ""Famous Monsters"" is very easy to listen to, but rarely stands out amongst metal artists today.(NOTE: This review was originally written Oct 12 '99)"
2,the times they are a changin',"Let me say I have been listing to this band for over a decade. When I heard they were getting back together I was thrilled. I even drove 5 hours to see them live. It was by far the best show I have ever seen. But since the time they reformed with Michael Graves I've watched this band go steadily down hill. Like a lot of fans after I heard American Psycho, I was saying ""Glen Who?"". Since then though the band seems to be moving into a different direction. If you started listening to the Misfits with the release of American Psycho, you probably will like the disc. However if you were listing to Misfits before American Psycho was released, you probably won't like this albumn."
1,They can't be serioius with this one...,"Skip Famous Monsters and get a real Misfits CD like Static Age or Walk Among Us, because this ain't the real Misfits. Jerry Only(who never wrote any of the old Misfits songs) is the only original Misfit on this album and as a result this CD doesn't even sound like the Misfits. It sounds more like a bunch of washed up eighties heavy metal guys trying cash in on the Misfits name."
5,Greatest Album,How dare anybody to say bad things about this album it rocks thats allyou need to know. Have you got that you american pig!
2,what happened to the misfits?,"American Psycho was an energetic album from start to finish never letting up, delivering classic songs. Graves did a tremendous job exorcising Danzig's ghost. But,on monsters the fits' sound like they're drunk . Graves pushes aside his uptempo scream of a delivery,which was one of the things which made psycho great, for an attempt at a Danzig style croon, and comes off flat! notice the overkill of guitar distortion on the album to make up for the vocals lack of balls! The shame of it all is that the songs are good on the album, just not performed to their full potential. We see a glimpse of the psycho era Graves on "" Them "", and ""Helena"", but for the rest of the time he's too restrained. The Misfits need to figure out whether or not they want a Danzig imposter fronting the band, because Graves has the potential to be his own man,except not on this album."
5,fun fun CD,Just picked this up and American Psycho. I really liked both CDs.Plenty of great tunes on both CDs. Descending Angel is a great f*ckin' tune!!
5,The most fun CD I own! Give Graves a shot!,"This is by far some really fun music. Michale Graves rocks with the second album in the ""new"" Misfits line up. Too bad Graves is no longer with the Misfits.Get this album, turn it up loud and have some fun!"
4,"well, this is a good cd","Well, I will write this is swedish, because I am so bad in eglish. SORRY!Detta är en väldans bra skiva, med ett par undantag.Jag tycker att alla som klagar p nya Misfits kan hlla käften, rent ut sagt. Visst, Glenn Danzig är inte med. Men Graves är s j*vla bra, s jag saknar ej Glenn. Jag tycker att Glenn Danzig är bäst i just bandet Danzig och Michael Graves har den rösten som passar bäst till Misfits.Jag har ju d den europeiska versionen, med tre bonusltar, och jag mste säga att lt nummer 20 är nästan den bästa p skivan.Cd'n är väldigt bra, men man mste lyssna igen den ngra gnger.och kom ihg att Misfits ska man ej ta p allvar.Bye bye"
2,Weak......................,"This album is similar to American Psycho, just not nearly as good. The lyrical content sticks to the horror film theme. But the music is bland. I gave it several listens, but not one song stood out. American Psycho is a much better album. This album sounds like the leftovers from the American Psycho sessions. If you want to here the real Misfits, buy Walk Among Us or Static Age. Graves can never be as good as Danzig. American Psycho was a decent stab at it, but Famous Monsters doesn't even draw blood."
1,Where is the Misfits!,This cd is pure guitar noise! No vocals. It is a disgrace to the original misfits. Graves blows on most of the songs. Where is his energy. Glenn needs to get back and make things like the once were.
1,Buy the box set!,"This album is completely stupid...This is not the Misfits and if the last atrocity unleashed by these washed up, wanna-be, posers wasn't enough to convince you, then this album surely will. All the songs (and I mean all of them) are silly, pseudo-post-punk efforts that fall flat within the first 10 seconds, they are pure listening dissatisfaction. Danzig wrote all the old Misfits songs and when he left, the Misfits died. Why Jerry feels the need to ruin the legacy of what was once one of the greatest punk outfits and influential bands of their day is simply a mystery to me? Just listen to Saturday Night. Could you imagine Glenn singing ""I was crying on Saturday night""? This is not punk, it is not the misfits and it is definitely not good. Please do yourself a favor and buy the Box Set, or check out the new Samhain Box set...but leave this piece of trash well alone."
1,This is junk,"Okay....to clear the air...Glenn Daznig (the original singer for the Misfits in the 80's who doesn't appear on this record) wrote all of the Misfits songs. Not just the lyrics either: Glenn plays guitar and bass and wrote probably a good 80% of the music. Therefore, GLENN DANZIG WAS THE MISFITS. Without Glenn, Jerry Only and Doyle decided to steal the name and produce this embarassment. This album is a total joke, and if you for some twisted reason actually enjoy it, please buy the old Misfits albums from the 80's with Danzig and realize that THIS IS NOT THE SAME BAND...AT ALL."
1,The New Misfits suk,"This is horrible.The Misfits should've called it quit with A.P .The inlay art of the lyric sheet is gay.We know that the Misfits died when Glenn left.They tried to do an old tune like ""Last Caress"".....NOOOOOOOOO.It did'nt even sound like ""Last Caress"".THIS SUX!"
5,David Harness,"David is my one DJ in the US. He never dissappoints, and when Im in SF I always make it a point to hear him live. This man has his finger on the pulse on house music 24/7/365....Go David, and continue going what you do my friend!!"
5,Hard to find,"I remember these items from childhood, but could not locate anything like this locally. Great little tool!"
1,An okay book once upon a time,"In 1990 when this book was translated into English, it may have been a leading book on reptile diseases. Now in 2001, it is severely outdated. Quite a bit of information given is incorrect (ex: vitamins only needed once every 3 months, the only solution for dystocia is surgery, etc). Also, very little information is even given as to individual diseases. In summary, don't waste your time or your money on this book. Look for a more modern book with more information."
4,For better understanding,"In 1985 as i write this book ""Reptile Diseases"", it was a first in this kind, right. It was written for hobby herpetologist people. To start within for better understanding and resque for this kind of animals. A helpness as they are in private terrariums. So know after I,m back from over 10 years expeditions in the whole world, I have to explain and to write down a lot of new experiance incase by Reptiles and Amphipiens.I start this work as herpetologist in 1967 and know i now, i have a wide experience taken, to write all news down again. All my thanks to the customers,the delivers and publishers. Best regards Rolf Hackbarth called Rocco"
3,"Not so great, additional references needed for passing","This package with the simulator seems to be sufficient for learning the stuff on the exam, however there were some questions on the exam which are from material not covered in this book. So I would recommend that before taking the exam refer other books on the same subject, and also take a look at cram sheets available on the Internet. However the topics on VLAN and IP addressing were excellently covered by this book. Other than that if you have read books like Data Communications by William Stallings and Computer Networks by Tanenbaum , this book gives a sense of deja vu."
5,CCNA Cert Kit,Outer container got squished in transit but materials in great shape and cd new and sealed in sleaves.
1,"hmmmmmm, interesting comments",So this kit says it was published in 2007 and all the comments are from 2002 ???? These people can make better money elsewhere !!!
4,CCNA,"I am enjoying the way the books are written. I am confused so far on the labs, but they will come in handy later. Mr. Lammle has a great writing style, and I feel I will be properly prepared for the exam."
2,"If this is the best, someone needs to write a good one!!","I'm amazed at the number of reviewers who gave this 5 stars. I passed my CCNA despite this book, as much as because of it. There is really no excuse for so many typos and poor explanations. And the E-trainer is truly a joke. If you're going for the CCNA, be sure to check into the alternatives."
1,Very displease with AMAZON and the package,"Displeased with this entire transaction. First, the package was received with box seal labels already broken but NO SOFTWARE was opened. Second, package contains two study guides however, both books read exacly the same, almost word for word. Third I returned the package to AMAZON with a thorough explaination of the above and they would only refund $72 on a $144 purchase, 50%, even though no software had been opened. Upon finding this out, I promptly e-mailed them back with instruction to halt the refund and return my package, they ignored my request and did not respond back to my e-mail, they went ahead and processed the rediculous refund. I'll think twice before doing any more business with AMAZON."
2,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled. Despite what other people may say here this is not an easy book to get through unless you have extensive computer experience. And I'm no dummy. I went to a top 20 undergrad. You really need on-the-job experience with computer networks in order to understand and benefit from this book.Also, don't even bother purchasing it unless you are already working in the computer industry. In case you didn't notice there are no jobs in computers now. Even computer science grads are having problems finding work. So don't buy this book thinking you will be able to find work if you pass the exam."
5,Got me my CCNA!!,"This is one of the best Certification books i've seen. very helpful end of the chapter questions, end of the book questions, and before you get started questions... The book does have some errors, but the good far out weighs the bad, I did not use the e-trainer to study, just the book and i passed my first time taking the test, unlike with other certification guides. This book will get you your CCNA, but don't think your gonna be a Cisco guru ... the book does what it promises, gets you that certification... but you need years of experience to be a guru..."
3,way over done!,"Yup, this will get you through the test but when you walk out of the testing center you will think like I did: I paid way too much to prepare for this test. All I really needed was just one book and no fancy fluff. Hey, you do not need router experience to pass this test, just know your material. Keep it simple and dont waste your money on fluff. Cheers"
4,Excellent book...,"I passed the exam after reading the book and that was it. I didn't even use any of the included e-trainer virtual lab CD. I should have just bought the book without the kit. Although book contains some errors and typo I find the format very clearly written and easy to understand. However, don't expect to see those practise exam questions apear on your real exam word for word. It's not a MCSE exam... Not a perfect book but good enough to get you passed. I would buy it again."
3,"Enough to pass the test , but not to excel","I had some experience with Cisco stuff. I finally commit to get CCNA. I start looking for a good CCNA guide, which can fill the gaps and help me recall. I bought this book with e-trainer. I never opened e-trainer or touch a router during the training. The information in the book was enough to pass the test from first time. I was quite frustrated with Frame Relay section of the book. My knowledge of Frame Relay was very vague and the book didn't provide enough information for me to feel prepared for exam. I had to find additional info about it. The book will definitely help you to pass exam, but doubt it that you can 1000 with it."
5,automotive cheap tricks & special f/x,"This is a great book, lots of color photos and great how ideas, loved it"
3,A Good Source Of Info,"I haven't finished this book as I just got it. But, I will say it's a good book and will answer your many questions. It's got some nice exercises that can help you get in touch with yourself and your life. As a matter of fact, the second exercise in the book helped me to make connections to see how certain experiences in this life, which I could not understand could come from past life experiences. If it's your first time getting in touch with past lives, I'd say this would be a really good beginner's book."
