4,CHANTE'S GOT A BEAUTIL VOICE AND BEAUTIFUL SONGS TO SING!!!,I am so glad I bought this album. YOu can listen to this on a cool calm day to go with your mood or you can listen on a hectic day and it will make you relax. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis did a good job collaborating and Rodney Jenkins did a great job bringing out the funky side of Chante which we don't hear often. You should snatch this album when you get the chance.
2,A Bit Disappointing / Not As Awesome As I Thought,"I had high expectations for this CD. Unfortunately, Chante didn't reach them. She still has a beautiful voice but most of the songs put me to sleep. I love ""If I Gave You Love, Chante's Got A Man, Easy and I Cry To Myself."" Everything else can be erased.By the way, I just heard Jennifer Lopez and her song sounds just like ""If I Gave You Love."" Chante does a much better job. Jennifer should stick to acting. All of the slick video production/fine body having in the world will not give her a better singing voice.Sorry Chante. Better luck next time on the CD. Four out of Fourteen is not a very good thing. Maybe Kadeem is making you a little bit too happy and your listening and discerning skills have been lowered. Rethink your choice of producers and beg George Duke to work with you again.Believe me, I am not playa hating...I just expected better from you...:("
2,Disappointing compared to her first two albums,Not much quality here from a previously very gifted artist. She should avoid the populous themes and stick to mature subject matter as she did on her first two outstanding efforts.Purchase the other 2 (definitely) first and then this one but only if you must.
3,Chanté Goes Mainstream,"Chanté definitely decided to go more mainstream with this album. Her first two albums targeted a more mature contemporary R&B audience. Even though the production on most of the album is very current and trendy, it seems that Chanté struggled on which direction she wanted to take the album this time around. While ""If I Gave Love"", ""Heartbeat"" and ""I Got The Love"" are cool uptempo songs produced by the likes of Rodney Jerkins and Jermaine Dupri, they seem out of place against songs like the ballads ""Easy"" and ""I See You In A Different Light"". Not to say that you can't mix up your album with different styles and tempos, but it just doesn't seem to gel on this album. One shining moment on the CD is the soaring title track where Chanté sings with more passion than on previous efforts. Chanté definitely has a great voice, but she needs to decide which direction she wants to take her singing career."
5,CHANTE DROPPED THE BOMB!!!,"Chante really did it this time. With the great hit ""Chante's got a man"" she blew the c.d. up. Her songs are true stories of real experiences and she lays it out on the real. She did a great job and her great vocal skills only help out her lyrics all the more. Chante, you go girl!"
5,The Moment is definitely hers!,"This album wasn't good as ""A Love Supreme"", but some of the songs on this album are superb, especially cuts like ""Blooming Flower"", ""Easy"", and, ""If I Gave Love"". Her voice is like a fine wine--it only gets better with age. At least she's not trying to sound like Brandy, Monica, or the other divas that are on the scenes. Instead of performing vocal gymnastics, she goes for subtley, and that's beautiful. This is one album I can listen to over and over and over again! If you don't have it, GET IT NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN!"
1,what waste,Chante Moore can sing.but her talent is wasted on this by the numbers sounding R-N-B of today.trying to cross-over and working with the hot producers of today do nothing for her at all except put her in the used bin pile.that's sad cuz she has real talent.
4,it has to grow on you,"I really liked ""Chante's Got A Man"", ""I See You In A Different Light"", and ""In My Life"". One of the songs sounded like Jennifer Lopez's. You also had to be at that level of intamcy to appreciate this album. However on average her vocals were great. The fast songs have to grow on you."
3,DiSsApOiNtInG,"I was very disappointed in this CD... I probably wouldn't have been that disappointed, except I expected so much more from Chante... After I heard ""Chante's Got A Man"", I expected for the CD to be really amazing, but the rest of the songs didn't compare. And the track that Rodney Jerkins produced ""If I Gave Love""... sounds just like Jennifer Lopez's ""If You Had My Love"", which was also produced by Jerkins... I think Chante got cheated. Then she did a duet with JoJo Hailey, who is not EVEN close to being her equal when it comes to music. I expected better."
2,Rather a chore to read,"I would only recommend this book to students of the 14th or 15th century. The plot is ponderous and the characters un-engaging. The atmosphere of the Middle Ages seems well drawn and is the best part of the book. After reading of certain ""medical"" remedies it is a wonder the human race even survived."
2,Is this the most annoying book I've ever read?,I know this isn't the worst book I've ever read but it may be the most annoying. I can't imagine why Ackroyd wrote this book.I don't care to find an answer to the mystery at the heart of the book because I don't care about any of the characters in the book.The book is a silly waste of the reader's time and the author's effort.Ackroyd should have written an historical essay on London in the Middle Ages and not foist his copious knowledge onto such a silly and witless plot.I give it two stars only because of the local colour and fabulous vocabulary of old English words and terms.
4,Enjoyable read,What wasn't there to enjoy in this book? Very entertaining and kept you in the holiday spirit. I will definitely look for more Teresa Hill Books to enjoy.
5,Real relationships,"I was expecting a typical Christmas themed feel good book but instead I was introduced to one of the few real couples I've ever met in between the covers of a book. First, Sam and Rachel are already married. So often romance books are about the discovery of love but Twelve Days is about the resurrection and salvation of a love shattered by the worst tragedy any parent can imagine--the loss of a child. The struggles they have are honest and I'm hopeful to find Book 2 soon!"
3,"Good book, but a little angsty for me","I read the book through even though quite a bit of it was very depressing and sad. I kind of like my reads to balance out in the emotional spectrum, and I have to say that this one was heavily weighted toward angst. The storyline was good and by the end you finally have a happy ending… Sort of… But I don't think that I will be reading the other books in the series simply because I like more happy in my books."
2,Finished it just for principle's sake,Well - this book was okay. I really started to get bored with the characters after a little bit and started to wonder when the book was going to end. I finished it just so I could say that I finished it. Deleted it from Kindle - would not read it again.
5,Emotional and Magical,"Teresa Hill's TWELVE DAYS is a wonderful read, for the holiday season or any time. I loved the very real depiction of a marriage, of the magic of children, and of Christmas in a very special place. Sam and Rachel are the kind of characters who speak straight to the heart, and I confess I cried, but there were tears of both sadness =and= joy. This is definitely a feel-good story that will capture you and your imagination."
3,Twelve days,"Very cute story and heart warming, but I skipped a lot of pages as they were predictable. It is a nice read!"
3,Twelve days is a great read.,Well written. Exciting. Sweet. Can't wait to read the next book in the series. Highly recommend this book. Wonderful read.
5,Very good story!,All the characters are well developed and thought out. Liked the story very much and was glad to read Book two. BTW this is Linda Wiley and not Carlisle who read the books and is writing the review.
3,Touching,I enjoyed reading this book. It was a very heart warming story that truly touched me. I have no desire to read the other books in the series.
5,I'm hooked,"I downloaded this book because it was free, now I absolutely can't wait to read the whole series and see how the kids turn out!"
4,Was the sex necessary?,"I really loved this book and couldn't put it down. The story and writing are wonderful and I would have stocked up several copies for gift giving for many of our YA readers in the family & circle of friend were it not for the sex. There wasn't much, but enough to ruin the book for gift giving to anyone not an adult. I did but the next books as soon as finished this one. Spoiler alert- the others have a lot more sex and are also not suitable for YA readers. Bummer because this is such a wonderful story and to have the author continue the story into the adult lives of the kids to see how they turned out would have been great reads for many YA readers and families."
2,Tedious read,"I just couldn't get into this book. It just seemed to take forever. I didn't feel very drawn to the characters overall and I found myself skimming a lot of the book just because as I read the descriptions and narrative didn't catch my attention. I was pretty sure I knew what would happen in the end...maybe didn't foresee all of the twist along the way. Felt like the back & forth in the relationship between Sam & Rachel didn't feel completely believable. Even though I can understand they were both hurt in life, the continual suggestion that they wouldn't stay together just didn't ring true for me."
3,Overall A Good Read,"Overall I enjoyed this book, and will go on to buy the next in the series. The only complaint I would have is that the conversations between Sam and Rachel regarding their relationship, over and over again did get a bit tedious, and I found myself skim reading some of them to get to the next part."
2,Twelve Days,"I like this book because I am sentimental at heart. have an idea what will happen but still kept on reading, got to be a little too long, but love the ending."
4,Nice,"Pretty good, even if imperfect compilatiom from the only french rocker that matters. OK you have Gaby Oh gaby and some others but some of his more inventive stuff that was for example on Passé le Rio Grande are not there. Also you feel him softening towards the later parts of his career which is not that good. You could do without some of the live versions as well...Anyway it is well worth having."
5,One of the best!,This is one of the best experimental electronic albums out there! And i don't say that very often!If you're into that kind of music then you MUST check this out! Take my word for it.It's half sung/spoken in french but that doesn't distract you AT ALL from the brilliance of the music. There are some really good and interesting ideas behind the beats in this one.Plus Alan Wilder (Ex-depeche mode/Recoil) helps out on track #5!
2,"Cute Shoe, but Not for Wide Feet","I got these shoes in the taupe suede and thought they were adorable until I tried to get them on my feet. I wear a 10W and have no trouble with other Naturalizer shoes, but this is a Mary Jane, and although the shoe would be wide enough for my foot, the strap is not! The button doesn't unbutton, and even with the elastic band stretched as far as it will go, I still couldn't get the shoe on. My foot is wide but not especially fat or tall, but even so the strap is about 1-1/2 inches too short. I am tremendously disappointed, because there is no way to extend the strap (or remove it) without ruining the look of the shoe. Maybe a narrow foot will have no issue with the strap, but if you wear a wide size, forget it."
4,Decent shoe for the very picky,This shoe fits well. It is a narrow but is still just a bit wider than I would like. For the money it is a good shoe.
2,High Arches cause Failure,"These shoes may work for people with lower arches. The strap is nonmobile,and with absolutely no flexibility caused problems. I got these shoes for a wedding but when I slipped my feet into them the right shoe tore. The only reason I am giving this two stars is this. Naturalizer tends to be a good shoe, and the quality of the left shoe was decent.I have very high arches, hence my disclaimer, this shoe is for the low of arch. For any foot I recommend an insert as with all dress shoes the interior is slick. I have serious foot issues having had gangrene in one of my feet (and yes I still have my toes, the shape of the top is very comfortable if you can get past the strap."
2,The original was better,"Save your money. If you can find it, pay an extra $... and buy an original copy. The printing and everything else about the original blows away this reprint.The information is priceless, but you can probably research what you need from a library.For the serious New York buff only."
1,WARNING!,"My copy of this book has a serious problem in pagination. The publisher messed up the order of pages 17 to 32, making this section impossible to read. Fortunately, I have the original text from which this was taken and can help you identify if you have a problem copy (I don't know if all copies were published with this problem) and tell you the proper order of the pages.The first sixteen pages are alright and page 17 is a full color plate. Turn to page 18. If it starts with the words:""She walked on following the street.""your copy is defective.To read the text of a copy with this defect in its original order, read it as follows:pp. 1-16, 30, 26, 20-25, 19, 29, 18, 32-62.The pages between 16 and 32 not listed are full page illustrations.NOTE that this is a review of the defective copies and only deals with the defect, not the content of the work. Now that I can read it in its proper order, I will also write a review of the content that will be submitted to Amazon later."
4,"Description of a good book, that's well worth reading.","This book deals with the first trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were accused of murdering their rich parents. It examines very well the background of both the father and mother, and describes very detailed what happened when the brothers shotgunned their parents. One thing the book fails to do, is give an answer as to why it happened. This would also be nearly impossible to do, but it does provide several key facts that might help one to reach a conclusion."
4,menendez,"Good, more information then 'Bad Blood: The true story behind the Menendez killings'. Informative if looking for more of an inside view of the first trial and Jose Menendezes' rise to the top. But, like another reviewer stated, its just a drawn out version of the trial transcript. Leaves you with enough facts to decide for yourself if you believe these boys defense. When you read it, it sounds like a script version of the movie, 'Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills'. If you saw Court TV's live coverage of the trial, and the movie's they made you'll basically have read the book."
2,Stupid!,"I love Eddie Murphy, but this movie just wasn't funny. Doesn't even compare to Trading Places or Beverly Hills Cop."
3,A con-man hits Washington,"In California in the late 70's a fellow named Bob Wilson was electedon name recognition in California ( a democrat). He just wasn'tthe Republican Bob Wilson who had been congressman from California for many years.This movie turns that idea into farce where con-man brings his gangto Washington and starts reaping the benefits.What changes things is his new girl friend, his conscience and a little girl with cancer.What results is an exposure of a corrupt chairman of an importantcommittee. I kind of liked the movie and how it points out the flawsin the current system."
3,disappointing but has some moments.,"I am a political junky AND an Eddie Murphy fan and I had great expectations for this movie. And for the most part the first half has pretty interesting and entertaining. But the script bogged down and just flattened out towards the end. EM still makes it fun to watch. This is a rental, not a purchase.Boy, politicians should have been great fodder for a comedy but this movie missed its potential"
5,"Hilarious, Great directing.","Eddie Murphy is a street hustler who hustles a seat in the House of Representatives. the first two thirds of the movie, with an accent on comedy, are the best"
2,one of eddies worst movies,"i watched this movie a couple of times and its horrible. not nearly as good as beverly hills cop, trading places, or coming to america. this is one of, if not his worst movie."
4,Underrated,"I believe The Distinguished Gentleman to be underrated beyond belief. Eddie Murphy delivers his lines brilliantly in what is really a witty script. While the story is a reach, it's also a hilarious mockery of America's political system and the type of things that really go on in Washington.The movie is a bit outdated, it has an 80's type of style (although I believe this movie was released in the early 90's), but honestly that's not a bad thing either. It takes an edge off things, and for the most part Eddie Murphy's crudeness is kept to a minimum.If you like any of Murphy's work, at least give this one a shot...it's personally my favorite of the movies he's made."
4,About Time,"Well if theres one thing I cant stand its a load of ponsed up toss, which thank God you dont get with this CD.Long story short a friend of a friend of a distant aquaintance mentioned the band and purely by the fact I remembered the name I took a chance and gave it a whirl. Right from the off you get in your face production, a tight groove and slap it if you like it lyrics. The genre twists and turns and you certainly take a journey or two throughout the record,(some good some bad) from funkadelic grooves to folky acoustic ballads, bar room blues to classic rock but in the final track (excluding the somewhat out of place Bonus track)Another Day you get your admission fee back with interest.If you like it gift wrapped and disposable go elsewhereif you like it real...."
5,Great rod!,"For the price, this rod works terrific. I normally use a 5' 6'' spinning rod, but can assure anyone that if you haven't used a bait casting rod before, especially one this length, 4' 6'', you will have no trouble adapting to using this one. There are no ceramic inserts in the eyes, so that may be a deal breaker for some, but I don't notice any difference. I have hooked a couple 3 pound bass, many crappie, a catfish and a foot plus gar with this rod and it has worked great."
3,"Good stuffitallin to a brick book, hard as a reference","There are reasons for getting hardback copies of these books - you don't break the spine at your first perusal for a start. And they don't push the page margins and typeface to the point that you need those special glasses and thin thumbs just to read it. These comments apply to this paperback only.As to the content, you will find many of your favourites here, truncated sometimes for no reasons apparent, and mixed with quotidia of interest only to Johnsonian scholars. The Index is a mess, and the Contents Table will have you breaking the spine even more.I would condemn it to Kindle/IPad, except that neither could produce a search engine sophisticated enough to understand the nuance and intelligence behind his simple prattle."
5,A Wonderful Collection of Stories,"Paul Lachlan Peck's ""Classic Children's Literature"" is a delightful collection of priceless works which are familiar, at least in title, to all of us. Stories from our own childhood and schooling are uniquely reviewed by a vast cross section of authors from all around the Country and from all different walks of life. This book is a ""must"" for your personal library and is also a great gift idea for family and close friends."
5,Letters and Journals,"Since paper was expensive in the 1700s, we have very few writings from the Burgoyne campaign in Vermont, and even fewer from women. This book of excerpts from the diary of Baroness Riedesel is a wonderful insight from a woman's viewpoint of this campaign. While it necessarily is primarily from the English/Hessian side of the campaign, Baroness Riedesel also comments on the colonials she sees.The translation is smooth, readable and reflects an interesting personality.I highly recommend this book."
1,shit,"I'm sorry, but this music quite honestly scares the fuc**n sh*t out of me. it's absolute noise and nothing deeper than that."
1,Questionable....,"If you are really a hardcore fan of the band, you may want to buy this cd. But, if you are sensitive to foul language, and sucky rhymes, don't even think about it! I can make better music than this on the crapper, after I eat mexican food. Take it from me. If you really want to own this cd, have somebody make you a copy. It's not even worth buying a real copy."
1,Just more banal Rap junk.,"This group relies on the strength on their profusely vulgar, hedonistic and completely mindless lyrical bank to garner sales from a bunch of dorky white teenage boys having an identity crisis because they've OD'd on too much Rap. And there's nothing new this time around; just more bad poetry juxtaposed to a drum-machine. Period."
1,Please shoot me,"Okay, I can understand the fact that ICP is original and different. I know they have a huge underground following, especially among white trash retards. I've tried to feel this, but It's just about impossible. It's hard to imagine anyone other than a 15 year old kid with a mild case of mental dysfunction could enjoy this crap. Unfortunately, there is a large number of adults who listen to it. God help our future!"
1,Insanely Bad Joke...,"I used to be a juggalo. This record marked the beginning of ICP's downfall, either that or I just started realizing how un funny they are. It takes no talent to do what ICP do. ICP make Vanilla Ice seem like a God. This music is horribly bad. It's aimless misogyny and violence, the problem with all this is ICP are a couple of big wusses.Come on juggalos, don't be stupid. This cd is such dirt. They had to bring in a bunch of guests including The Jerky Boys and ODB to make any song on this cd worthwhile. It takes no talent to do what ICP do, the only worse rap is Puff Daddy. I suggest you go get an Outkast cd or something and don't waste your cash on this poor excuse for rap."
3,the older the better,i have about every insane clown posse cd there is and i find this 1 about the worst if ur gonna buy icp cds the go with the great milinko or riddlebox the old stuff is alot better so listen 2 what i say because i know what im talkin bout
1,seriously flawed stab at an inherently black medium,"There are far too many young people listening to this music who have not already heard the prerequisite James Brown's Funky People vol 1, 2. Public Enemy. Souls of Mischief. Pharcyde. DeLaSoul. Tribe Called Quest. Eric B and Rakim. DJ Red Alert. Wu-Tang Clan. Search Amazon for one of these other artists and buy a record from black rap artists and not white boys (apologies to Beastie Boys and 3rd Bass). Then there are Funk essentials also: Isaac Hayes. Curtis Mayfield. Barry White. mid 70s Marvin Gaye Temptations. Bootsy Collins. George Clinton. Funkadelic. Ohio Players. and more. Please do not buy any ICP records until you know the roots of the medium that they are trying to ""Pat Boone."""
3,Its ok,"I bought this CD because I like the song titled Another Love Song. But the CD has a lot of swearing and vulgar content. Dont get me wrong im a vulgar dude myself. But I have a full gym in my garage and I like to blast my music while I work out. My neighbors and their eight year old daughter probably dont wanna hear that. If you like a lot of cussing, this is the band for you!!!!!!!!!"
2,What happened to the wicked clowns?,"This is one of those moments where long time fans will be dissapointed but newcomers will love. While the cd isnt a complete failure it definately isnt as good as their previous efforts. They stayed away from the carnival theme on this album and came with more ""reality"" rap, which I am not to pleased about. I have EVERY album they have put out and this is definately their worst."
3,The 5th was a ICP album...and its there album,"ICP made it for THERE fans...not you tards who go out and listin to mainstream Jay-Z and DMX ........you have to have a different mind frame to listin to ICP...you have to look past alot of things....you bastards who just sit there who love all the mindless MTV crap go and listin to ICP of corse your going to think they suck.....even though Old School ICP was way better (Ringmaster,CoC) If its not on MTV top 10 you usually think it sucks....but yet there number 4 on top 200 with no radio or MTV play.....so all you ""Crtics"" can stick it up your ass.....damn homos get out of OUR world"
2,Not too hot!,I have all of the ICP cdz and this is the absolute worst. I was so bummed because Riddle Box and The Great Milenko are awsome and this cd sucked. This album was all about swearing and not about the dark carnival which was promised. I hope the final album is all about phat rhymes. :P
5,Even a non-rap fan can be a juggalo ninja!,"I'm a Howard Stern supporter, so I bought this album to support the show. Now, I LOVE this ""card"" (CD, whatever). I've eaten up ICP's website, and am into them big time! It's disappointing to see that I'm so into ""Mad Prof."" while everyone else seems to hate it. Anyway, ""Terrible"" is FANTASTIC and intelligently written, and ""Everybody Rize"" is just plain fun to listen to!"
3,this cd wasnt that good,this was defently not the best jokers card. ill rank it right above carnival of carnage at #4. i thoght it wasc bad compared to milenko and if your just getting into icp buy milenko cuz this cd was no where near as good
4,this cd kicks ass,"I thought this cd was bad ass it is probably my #2 of I.C.P. cds, my favorite is Riddle Box by far, but i would reccomend this one if you never heard I.C.P. and are curious. It really kicks ass my fav. songs are Play With Me, Bitches, and I like The Shaggy Show. All and all this cd is great but not my favorite so i give it 4 stars get Riddle Box."
1,retarded music for retarded people,"people, instead of wasting time with this crap, do yourself a favour and listen to Aretha Franklin's Lady Soul, Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, or The Beatles Abbey Road. you'll thank me when you grow up."
1,"boring , disgusting , total waste of money","whoever listens to this cd and actually likes it , sorry but you're a very dumb guy , these guys have no talent , they just attract people because of their makeup , but what about the music? it's just plain awful , the worst album ever"
1,Laughably bad.,"It's pretty difficult for me to believe that something as unspeakably unintelligent and doggerel as this could sustain even a small fan-base. Especially in the face of the perennial monotonous ""phat beat"" rap banality. Which is sadly and uniformly exhibited here by these vacuous sub-primates. The ""dope rhymes"" here are repugnant, and the only conceivable reason I can think of that would provoke some really sick people to buy this un-avant-garde dreck. To make a long story short: ICP predictably reiterate the old (really, really old) palpatating ""thud,"" and amalgamate it with accelerated profanity. Total dreck."
4,Downhill from here....,"This is the last good album that ICP has put out so far, which is sad because this was released in 1999. This album is ICP's first rock/rap album, but suprisingly to me it works, I think because Mike E. Clark produced it. To me there are many highlights to this album. ""Terrible"" is a hard hitting, politically charged song that critizices everything that is wrong with the world. ""Assasins"" is a great cover song of the classic by The Ghetto Boys. Snoop Dogg makes a great appearance on ""The Shaggy Show"" as does Ol' Dirty Bastard on ""Bitches."" ""Echoside"" features Twiztid and is actually the first Dark Lotus song ever recorded. To me, this cd is the last, maybe forever, that we've seen of the good ICP, which makes it special to any old school ICP fan. The clowns just aren't the same anymore, but if you want to relive the golden age, pick this and anything before it up."
5,A sweet juggling act!,"This is a great CD,I'm just gonna give a short rundown of each song*= worst *****= bestIntro-N/AJake Jeckle-*** Its alright, a little too shortBring it on-**** Pretty goodI want my sh*t-***** SWEET!B*tches-*** its alright...Terrible-**** pretty goodI stab people-**** funnyAnother love song-***** HILARIOUS!!!Everybody rize-***** another good song!Play with me-*** twistedJack Jeckle-*** same as Jake Jeckle...again too shortF*ck the world-*** good, a little bit redudant but its still goodThe Shaggy show-**** another funny one, a parody of modern talkshowsMad Professor-***** funny and a good song!Assassins-**** good, i like the blend of guitar!Echo side-** The only bad song on this CDNothings left-*** A good ending to a good CDIn conclusion, Jeckle Bros. is a sweet CD and the CD jacket is pretty sweet too, i wont ruin the suprise...."
1,I didn't know there were this many ignorant f***'s in this world,"surprising to see people like this album.This group's made up some retards who where make up to attract the 14 yr old boys who go to their shows. Mother f'ing ridiculous. It wouldn't be a surprise if the majority of their fans were molested by their fathers, they just give off that kind of vibe you know. I can't help but feel sorry to people that listen to them, but than I remember I just have to think about my own life. And if u ever seen these guys talk, it's pittiful one of them seems like a 15 yr. old A.D.D. child while another's motorskills are that of a 10 yr old. Lay off the crack guys. Well too much time spent on these guys, time to erase them from my memory. These (...) are trying to claim Detroit, f'ing idiots"
1,Terrible,"Their song title ""Terrible"" explains what this record is all about. Absolutely terrible! I've been a Clown fan since before many people heard of them and I love their old stuff. This was too un-ICP like. I love rock n roll...but ICP shouldn't be doing it. The only rap I'll listen to is ICP...and Amazing Jeckel Brothers was a true let down. I was glad to hear that their next album due in October will be going back to rap. So, to all you little kiddies out there that jumped on the band wagon for this album, get ready to jump off...cause if you loved AJB...you'll hate the new record."
1,This Band Sucks,I listened to a couple of ICP's songs and they are the worst band or group or what ever you want to call them i have ever heard in my life. Any one who would listen to ICP is a freek and stupid. I mean who in gods name would like a band that has there own wrestling league and wears make up is cool. I for sure think that is childish and is a sack of crap.DON&quot;T BUY ICP THEY SUCK!!!!!
1,THIS IS THE WORST GARBAGE YOU CAN BUY,I have heard some of the Insane Clown posses music so I thought this would be a good album. I turned out that it really sucked I could barely listen to the entire thing. They just swear and swear. I have nothing against swearing but it was boring how they kept using the F word to a bad beet. The only reason to buy this album is to throw away money.
3,A CLOWN?,what circuse did these clowns come from and icp r a bunch of liars thers no damn carnival if theres a carival its a carnival of shit
1,Crap,"I can see why these dudes have stayed underground for so long, cuz they're wack as hell. I see a lot of people saying that they stay underground cuz they like it, NO they don't they stay underground cuz they are wack, and only people that have no lives listen to their music. Don't buy the cd it is wack, wack beats, and rhymes. My 2 year old sister could rhymes better then that, and I don't even have one!"
1,I could make a better cd with $2.45 and 5 minutes,"Gimmicky. The only reason this band is famous is cuz they swear a lot (whooptee doo kiddies, that requires lots of talent) and cuz they constantly insult people. Wow, now THAT'S talent. The whole Joker Card or whatever thing gets old too. You want some GOOD rap metal? Buy Snot, (hed) p.e., Incubus or the first Powerman 5000 cd. This is just 60 minutes of none stop bullsh-t."
3,AweSome,What up Ninja's D3dBdyM4n back to give you the dealio up on this fresh cd. Buy this cd asap it's the shiznitz cuz well it's ICP Much clown love out there ninja's MUCH CLOWN LOVE to all the freaks in #icp on undernet they give this a 5 star as well.
1,Just plain lame,"They've been on a downward slide ever since Riddlebox, and it seems they've hit the bottom on TAJB. The music is the worst since CoC, which is inexcusable since they now have the cash to do more, and their lyrics, which are usually pretty clever, are focused almost entirely on saying ""f---"" and some variation of ""i love you but now i have to kill you"". Their new, guitar driven direction is horrid, since their guitarist knows all of about 4 chords, and the presence of actual rappers on the album only shows how lame icp is. Even the group seems to realize how flawed the album is, as they avoid playing many of the tracks off it in concert. Just tape Assassins and Play With Me off of someone who was duped into buying the album, the rest simply isn't worth your time or money."
1,Meaningless,"I own all 5 Joker cards but this one sucks. The lyrics on this are meaningless and have nothing to do with the dark carnival. I now claim I'm a former fan after ICP sold out at Woodstock for $100,000 when they said they wouldn't play for anyone who wasn't a juggalo. All their music now are sell outs trying to be funny and getting away from why they started. I'm disapointed"
1,Not too great,"I like ICP, but this album was horrible. Riddlebox and Milenko kicked a**, so I was disappointed by the lack of the carnival theme. This album was just an excuse to swear, unlike their older stuff which actually had entertaining content."
3,what happened?!?!?,"I'm a huge ICP fan...i've been waiting forever for their new CD to come out. I was so excited when i heard they had a new single out, and i rushed to get it. LOVED it. Loving the single, i expected the CD to be great. So great, that i ordered the CD in advance, and even payed extra for that day shipping. Hmm...now i wonder if it was worth it. From reading other ppl's reviews, i see many ppl are thinking exactly what i am. This is NOT their best stuff. I just got the CD, and it is already out of my CD player! The songs are OKAY, not great...a few good ones. The prank phone calls are funny (i'm cracking up as i go down the road), but that is about it. I was very disappointed."
4,This CD Rocks!!,"This is the first ICP CD that I have had the opportunity to listen to. It is definitely a keeper. The best tracks are Another Love Song, F*ck the World, Play With Me, Assassins, and pretty much every other song on this CD. Plain and simple. If you like ICP and you do not yet own this CD, BUY IT NOW. If you are like I was and you were not sure if you really wanted an ICP CD, BUY IT ANYWAY!"
4,Another Good One,First of all I just realized something. Wouldn't their technically be 7 faces in the dark carnival? 1.Carnival of Carnage 2.Ringmaster 3.Riddlebox 4.Great Milenko 5.Jake Jeckel 6.Jack Jeckel 7.? see. Anyway this is a good CD but not as good as Milenko.
5,Jeckel Brothers is the best,This was the best album by ICP so far. It's a little out there sometimes. But it has the freshness that they had in Carnival of Carnage. Mike Clark has outdone himself this time. This is their best work and I would not miss it by a longshot.
4,Come and witness the light of the Amazing Jeckel Brothers,"The Amazing Jeckel Brothers by the Insane Clown Posse is a suprisingly good cd.Most of the songs are good and have some sort of meaning to them and ICP express their meaning real good.This isn't total rap.Theres some rock roots mixed it with it.Shaggy 2 Dope has a cool voice on this cd.I also like the cover of it and this cd comes in a red jewl case.This isn't ICP's best work though,but its some of their best.The Amazing Jeckel Brothers is worth buying.So yeah...Come and withness the light my friend...Of...THE AMAZING JECKEL BROTHERS!!!!"
5,one more then the carnival will be upon us,"I bought the Amazing Jeckel Brothers album in the UK but it said nothin about limited editon, the track listing is the same and theres nothin about extra disks or anything, is the only difference the cover?Anyway, the album is amazing, with some of the posse's best work on it, stand out tracks like ""play with me"", ""nothings left"" and ""terrible"" make it a fine addition to the carnival.if youve heard any of the posse's previous work, or just want somethin different then get this cd, you shudn't be dissappointed."
1,ICP's worst and buddy that is bad!,"This has got to be ICP's worst album. It sounds like all of their other releases only the rapping is ten times worse! Violent j even attempts to sing. Most of it sounds like they made it up as they went along. They rip off of Esham again by stealing the track Fxxk the World which Natas did in 1995. They try to remake a Geto Boys song but it sounds more like a Pantera remake with the heavy metal guitars. They can't even stay on beat! Words can't describe just how bad this album really is! It almost makes Backstreet Boys and Jennifer Lopez sound good. All I can do is warn you proceed at your own risk. You might as well buy an Esham, Natas, Brotha Lynch Hung, Ganksta Nip, or Insane Poetry album. All groups that ICP stole from."
3,"Oh where, oh where has ICP gone","This CD is ok, but it isn't typical ICP. After Riddlebox, which was great, and Great Milenko which was the Schiznit, this CD seemed empty. When I listened to Milenko the first time I was immediately hooked, finding no bad songs. The Neden Game, House of Horrors, How Many Times?, Great Milenko, Down, Under the Moon, Halls of Illusion, Piggy Pie, Pass Me By, were all awesome. Not even one song on this CD can touch any of these songs. Even What is a Juggalo? which wasn't a big hit with me, looks like a smash compared to these. I have and always will be down with the clown, but i hope they have something better in store for the sixth and final jokers card. Bring back the old ICP."
3,ITS GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST,If you are a true ICP fan and you have been listening to them since they where the Inner City Posse then you would agree with me when i say that this is by far NOT the best album they have released ... To tell you the truth i think it has been all down hill since they made riddlebox. riddlebox was there greatest and i dont think they will ever top that effort
3,Dissapointing yet still awesome.,"Since 1990 Ive been an ICP fan. They're brilliant artists.They've paved the way for many artists like Limp Bizkit,and Korn.So when I heard that a new album was coming out featuring ODB and Snoop Dogg I was excited.When the day came I picked it up and man was i dissapointed. It is nothing compared to ""The Great Milenko"" and my favorite ""Riddlebox"".Still they do bring funny lyrics,and cool beats to ""The Shaggy Show"", and ""Mad Proffessor"".But there are way too many spoken word songs on here.But ICP is still one of my favorite bands,and Iam down with the clown."
1,THEY SUCK,"The Insane Clown Posse are sick, but their name fits them. They ARE insane. If you actually LISTEN to the lyrics in ""Another Love Song"", you want to throw up. Who acts like that? If you ask me, the Posse is a lame attempt at being Marilyn Manson wannabes. Don't get me wrong, I CAN'T STAND M.M., but even HE is better than these sickos."
3,not what you expect,"i was all ready to listen to this CD and love a few songs-what a disapointment!Riddlebox,Milenko, and i think even forgoten freshness is better than this. What happened to the fun songs? i like a few serious lyrics with a hip hop beat but almost all of this album is violent lyrics with a guitar background-not the same sound you used to. Nuthin wrong with violence in songs but thats pretty much all they rap bout and the guitar backgrounds not so good. All these crazy fanatics givin this 5 stars will buy anything ICP puts out and sayits great-i buy anything they put out too but i can admit when it sucks. U proabably will buy the CD anyways no matter what i say, but when u hear it, youll agree. The songs with Ol Dirty Bastard and Snoop are the best (and im not even big fans of the 2)-BRING BACK THE OLD,FUN ICP- the new crazy violent image and guitar sounds aint workin for them"
1,"Oh great, another Rap album (groan).","What's the big fuss over these guys? I mean, all that's given here is the same old hackneyed drum machines and obtuse, profane and totally mindless lyrics. It's amazing that Rap has been able to sustain it's popularity over the years, in the face on having no talent."
3,decent at best,"This cd is decent....i love Great Milenko, Riddlebox rules too. This one, though, seems to show that the ICP is starting to slow down. However, the song with Snoop Dogg rules. That one goes up with the best that ICP has done. Hope the 6th Joker's Card isn't as weak as this one."
4,One of the best CDs of the year!!!!,Noting can describe this CD!!!! All I can say is buying this was one of the best things I ever did!!!!
5,ICP Does It Again - A Great CD,"When I first got this cd I didn't think that it was a good as 'The Great Malenko'. However, after listening to more often I find that it actually their best cd so far. I have all of ICP's cd's and this is the best. What makes this album stick out is the great lyrics (which is what ICP is known for).Some of the best songs are: I Want My S**t, Nothing's Left, Play With Me, F**k The World, and Terrible."
3,Good ball to have for show and spare.,"Looks - 8/10Reaction - 5/10Power - 6/10I purchased the skull ball to have something cool and flashy to show off. But the ball is a plastic ball so does not have the spin that you crave in the lanes. It is a great looking ball and will quickly turn heads in the lanes after the first throw. But personally, also what I recommend, I use it as a ball to pick up on spares. It does not have a strong hit and it is great for straight throws. Splits I rather have a hit or miss but 4 out of 8 times I get them. Over all worth the price and if you like being a little flashy I say get one..."
2,Opening Night at Rodney's Place (1989),If I could have returned the CD I would have... I like Rodney Dangerfield all this was of comidians perfrming at his club and a few inserts of Rodney... One was a clip from his movie Back to School of him diving...
2,"Hey, where's Rodney?","I love Rodney, always will, so you can understand why when I viewed this release I was dissapointed. It had about a total of 12 minutes of the main man in his best form, yet the rest of the presentation was a collection of other comedians that are OK but not the stuff I was after. I can only take so much Tim Allen. There is only one Rodney and the others pale next to him but I would have liked a little more camera time with the king. Live and learn."
5,OFF THE HOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Drama Queen is off the hook.Those who haven't read it...Go get it!You will not be disappointed.Judging the book by its cover I knew it was gonna be good,not saying that all books are good when judging the cover but there was something about the cover of this book that got my attention.(the 2 men and 1 female)You know when looking at it,it's gotta be filled with drama.This book grabbed my attention from beginning to end.I like how Kayla had her family and friends there for her.It was sad how her sister treated her though.Craig was so full of himself.I thought Terrell and Kayla was gonna hook up but they were better off as friends and he did look out for her.This book is a quick read and if you haven't read it go get it!Ms.Hunt if you are reading this I like your writing style and I hope there is a sequel to Drama Queen.Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,WHERE'S THE DRAMA?????,"I FELT THAT THE BOOK WAS NOT FITTING FOR ITS TITLE. MOST OF THE MATERIAL WRITTEN JUST DIDN'T EXCITE ME. I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING REALLY JUICY, BUT INSTEAD I GOT SOMETHING REALLY BORING. IT WAS A NICE EFFORT THOUGH. MAYBE THE NEXT BOOK WILL BE A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING."
3,Author needs to take Drama Classes for Noire!,This book is OK but it is not what people are blowing it up to be! It was alot going on in this book but no way no how does this book deserve 5 stars if you want drama check out G-Spot by Noire! I read that book before Drama Queen & G-Spot book is filled with drama!
1,Can You Say....Not A Good Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was very disappointed with the profanity in the beginning of the book. I felt in my opinion that this was not necsessary to write a good book. I thought that the title IS fitting for this book... if you are indeed a drama queen. A word of advice for Ms. Hunt, get some writing lessons from Mr. Weber. He's the bomb!!!!!!!!!P.S. You need to get your review websites under control, its awful."
3,Maybe............,"I thought this book was okay and it was an easy read but it was not that great. I have to admit before reading this book I just finished reading an Eric jerome Dickey book so it may have tainted by view about this book. Some authors can have so much drama in there books that calling it drama queen would not be enough, unfortunatly for me this was not the case. I personally would have like to know more about the secondary characters then the main character in this book. I've read worst so I don't feel completly like I got played, for me it was just an alright book. One pet peeve: who names there daughter one name and in the next breathe says but her nickname is going to be DAY? I just found that weird, most people get nicknames because there a shorter version of there own name or because they look like a pookie or a junebug but to have a child and immediatly say her name is such and such but you all call her Day bothered me. I know it shouldn't but it did......"
5,D-R-A-M-A!,"La Jill Hunt really worked DRAMA QUEEN. This book is captivating from the prologue to the epilogue. It includes lessons on friendship and sisterhood, while keeping you engrossed with laughter and trepidation. There was enough drama, twists and turns, romance and surprises to keep this sister glued to the chair until finished. The surprise ending has me anxiously awaiting the sequel. This is a great read.Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbonof The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website..."
2,Ghetto Queen's would have been a better title,"The story line had potential had it been told by a more seasoned writer. The use of the N-word was outragous, The author used an adult theme told in a immature voice. I just felt the story was not well thought out."
5,One of the best books out!!,"IT was a really good book and I finished it in one day.If you truly love drama, then this is the book for you."
4,Too much appearance,It was a great novel. Lots of drama and lots of action but daggone Geno showed up too much. it was too predictable
4,Full of Good Drama,"The drama starts at the beginning, continues in the middle, and explodes in the end. I loved this story. Some parts were so real it was scary. Buy this book!"
4,Good Read!!,I slept on this book for a long time. I enjoyed the reading but almost found it to be more of a good read for a teenager. I was surprised at the ending. To sum it all up was it worth yes read. Yes. I will read part 2 since I purchased them both at the same time.
4,Well she doesn't look for drama...,(review of the hard cover edition copywright 2005)...It just seems to follow her everywhere she goes. Kayla tries to live a upholding life but gets screwed along the way. First her fiance and her sister. Then her baby's daddy and of course there is some drama from individuals who just have to be contact with these people. They all have it in for Kayla. Poor Kayla can't even walk in her own house without experiencing drama. Just a drama queen in her own right. Can't wait to read no more drama.
3,Nice Book,I jumped to get the sequel aready. pretty good story line. a lot of drama unfolded. this was my first hunt novel. i will continue to read her books.
2,No solutions offered...,"It's not that what some of Dr. Tannen says isn't true, but she ruins it by pointing out OVER AND OVER how it's basically society's (i.e.: men's) fault for every problem/shortcoming women have ever experienced. She doesn't hold women responsible for any of their own problems (which, in itself, is sexist towards women), and then, offers no solutions AT ALL on how to correct these problems. Basically, she runs through all the problems women have...and then the book ends"
2,Some Good Points but Frustrating to Read,"Certain parts of this book are though provoking, but for the most part the author offers few solutions...A better book to purchase would be any of the John Gray books, MEN ARE FROM MARS AND WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS would be a good start. While it takes a traditional approach (i.e. don't forget he was writing it for his age group) towards relationships, it offers many more workable solutions than this book.Overall, I think women will find this book easier to work w/ for obvious reasons. However, any women who truly want a workable relationship and who aren't trying to be bitchy will probably seek their information elsewhere....sorry, Tamnen."
2,"If you are a man, do not buy this audiobook !","After listening to this audiobook I was left feeling that I just wasted my time. Men are portrayed as insincere and mean. This book does not offer any methods for improving relationships, it is just a guy bashing session. The author (a woman) tries to use BIG words to sound more intelligent, she said ""fleeting"" every other paragraph. Deborah Tannen also has a very poor speaking voice that is very unassertive and weak. She has a dry mouth throughout the entire program (take a drink of water, please). She also explained that men stereotype women, there are also many sterotypes for men, lets be fair. Hey I will be the first one to admit that men are not perfect, but this book is categorizing men and women and definitely one ups women. If you are a women you may like this tape, but it was not for me."
1,Whining misrepresentation.,"Tannen represents herself as an objective linguist butdoes little more than rail against men and make a biased,self-serving case for women. Thankfully, most women withwhom I've discussed her work see through it and its reductiveclaims about report talk (men) vs. rapport talk (women).Not only is she an obvious, cliched, reductive thinker butan impoverished stylist as well. If the reader had a dollarfor each time she uses the word ""hierarchical"" (to men'sdiscredit, of course), he'd probably fare as well as Tannendid on the royalties for this nonsense. Women will only losein the competitive real world by following Tannen's advice."
4,I use this textbook...,This textbook is used in many of my communications classes at the University level. I recommend all books by Deborah Tannen.
4,Interesting and usefule...,"Clearly men and women have difficulties communicating at times and it can be extremely frustrating inside of relationship. Learning the dynamics of successful communication takes patience and a willingness to understand that men and women ARE different. Tannen's book demonstrates this fact in an easy to read and useful style. I also highly recommendBreaking the Argument Cycle: How to Stop Fighting Without Therapyby Sharon Rivkin. Rivkin shows that we often fall into a particular pattern of arguing that can live on for the life of a relationship and create painful and ongoing conflict. Her highly effective techniques show how to resolve conflicts in a simple, three-step process and turn even the most argumentative relationships into loving and intimate bonds that can last a lifetime."
4,Quite good,"I read this book when it first came out in paperback, and I've gone back to it more than once since then. I thought that the majority of Tannen's arguments made sense. She did a good job of backing up her thesis. She writes with a clear, concise style. I have used the book to help in communicating with some of the men in my life. I appreciate that Tannen acknowledges these gender differences as being rooted in culture rather than biology.My only criticisms of the book is that the author does tend to generalize. There are problems with some of the studies she cites, as well. However, these issues don't take away from the fact that the book is an interesting and easy read."
1,Psychogibberish,"Having studied linguistics in depth over the years, especially Tannen's mentor, Robin Lakoff, I feel this book does a disservice to its topic. I think that, as old as they are, the best books on the subject of man-talk versus woman-talk are by Dr. Joyce Brothers.Men come off rather badly overall in this book, which I think reinforces the stereotypes of men being rotten communicators who never listen.The book gets one star because it has an excellent reference list and great notes."
5,A lot of what we know is wrapped up in words...,"For an interesting foray into conversational differences between the sexes, consider reading Deborah Tannen's ""You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation."" You've probably noticed that a lot of my book recommendations have to do with books about language. Our memory is supported by the structural skeleton of language--a lot of what we know is wrapped up in words. The biggest failures of communication between product designers and their audience come from language failures.For more book reviews, please visit: [...]"
1,No You Really DON'T Understand,"Tannen's pop-gender theory just isn't cutting it. In academic circles, Tannen's ideas are as outdated as the hoop skirt. Elsewhere, they fall flat, poised on experiments without controls, haphazard 'examples' drawn from mysterious (and never defined or outlined) encounters with random people.Gone is social context, and other differences (cultural, age, and class) are never even considered in Tannen's book. Instead, she expects her readers to attribute all her described linguistic methods to mere gender difference. As a result, this book reads more like a dime-store novel than an intelligent critique of modern communication.A perfect example of what NOT to read if you are interested in gender theory or writings on gendered language."
1,Stereotypes men and women...,Stereotypes of men and women are latent throughout her book and her research is becoming outdated as more women are seeking some of the same things men are. How two people communicate is not based solely on gender but also individual personality and basic compatability which is underscored in her text. Decide for yourself whether her limited research will apply to real life (your life) before jumping on the relationship bandwagon.
3,Credit for being first,"The author reserves all the credit for being the one with the idea first before the tale of women and men being from different planets. This one, being older is not as polished and still has the point of view of a female human. Nevertheless, it does pinpoint some important issues in the communications between the sexes but it too often assumes women being submissive and innocent, and men being sullen and controlling, maybe it was then, it is not now."
5,You Just Don't Understand,The product sent is in very good condition. The product was sent properly and I got the book on time.
5,I teach nursing and I use this with male students,"not much to say that hasn't already been said.I teach nursing ( I am a guy) and I often see male students who aren't succeeding, for various reasons. Maybe they don't seem to interact with the women students in their class; maybe they hav e never had a woman as a supervisor, such as a couple of military veterans I have taught. In some cases, they don't know how to accept supervision from a female faculty member. Whatever the reason, lack of effectibve communication is the key. That's where this book comes in. I make sure they get it and study it, so as to understand the often-unwritten dos and don'ts of the workplace. this book provides a number of ""aha"" moments - times when the light bulb is turned on in their head for the very first time. it's the kind of book you can read a few aparagraphs at a time and still learn from. a classic."
1,Feel empty,Guess I just want to say that I feel bad for the craft of educational writing. I was excited to read this book but sorry to say that it seemed to simply reference a lot of cliché interactions in human communication where one side is blatantly childish. The childish person (always the male) is theorized to be motivated by nothing more than opportunity to enforce a shred of primitive dominance. While females cannot even grasp the abstract principal of something so simple as sportsman competition.
4,A Must Read!,"The book gets a bit boring and repetitive at times, but I highly recommend it to everyone pursing a heterosexual relationship! It has some very vital tips!"
4,Things are not always how you perceive,Did not have any expectations before reading. Satisfied by the way this book looks at different situations. It dissects your way of communicating with others. Did make me think a lot about things I am not good at doing. Really blew my mind
4,"Worth the read, but use caution","Tannen's book is well done and worth the read. However... it is also imbued with a subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, bias toward a perspective which presumes female modes of communication and other activities to be inherently superior to those of males. Of course, this is a patently false presumption. The examples of female communications/activities are almost uniformly praised and those of males are much more likely to be disparaged, either subtly or explicitly.If you read the book, and I recommend you do, you should keep an eye out for this stuff. You should not have to look far; if you do, that should give you pause. Actually, it is an excellent exercise in learning to spot this form of sexism.Overall, still, highly recommended."
3,I don't don't understand,I found it difficult to read and enjoy. There were a bunch of examples that I failed to connect to.
3,Massive problems preview alone Admittedly,"Just from the way the author already affirms the *cultural* conflation of difference with hierarchy and separateness, I can tell this thing is only going to reinforce the root of the problem: lack of acceptance and validation of persons as they are. That's the real problem in the communication. If people need to be the same and feel the same and agree and assume that that is intimacy, no wonder no one communicates well. And if anyone thinks that the only way to avoid hierarchical reinforcement is to agree, no wonder they fight poorly and think that fights are detrimental. The author gives relationships no fewer reasons to avoid conflict and rush toward communicating; just reasons and different ways to think about it. Not a problem solver at all."
4,Fast Talkers vs Slow Talkers,"I'll just mention one interesting point that I haven't really seen mentioned in the other reviews I perused: The issue of differences in style between people who talk fast and frequently interrupt and those who want to wait for a pause in the conversation before offering their comments.All my life I have been in the second group and as a result I've had a hard time getting in an word edgewise especially when in a large group. But after reading this book I realized that many people are just expecting me to jump in without waiting for a ""gap"" in the conversation to give my two cents - and if I wait for them to pause it might take the proverbial hell freezing over before I get a chance to say anything. It sounds ridiculously simple but it was really a revelation for me.Of course there is much much more to this book (which I highly recommend) but that is one simple idea that has already made a difference in my social interactions."
3,"Great Ideas, Great Concept... Extremely Drawn Out.","Although filled with a wonderful examination of human/gender behavior and communication, the preface and first chapter could easily supplement the remaining portion of the book. Tannen is extremely repetitive in her ideas and her research, often veering into tangents obviously relatable to the main thesis of the book. A fascinating overview of relationships-- although only really evident in the first few dozen pages."
3,Succubus on the Loose,"I've seen horror movies that were better, but I've also seen plenty that were worse. The succubus theme is an interesting element, and the women are appropriately beautiful and underdressed. ""The Devil's Nightmare"" is a pleasant 90-minute diversion, one of the better releases in Redemption's American line so far."
3,seven sinners and a succubi,"Seven tourists (representing the seven deadly sins) end up having to spend the night together. Along comes a yummy succubi to throw in some evening entertainment. It's a low budget 70's flick, but is still pretty good.If they updated the script and the special effects, this movie could have a brilliant remake someday."
4,Erika Blanc Can Chase Me Anytime!,"DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE is about seven tourists who get stuck at a spooky castle for the night. Their host is a baron / alchemist with a disturbing history and legacy. His family is cursed, and each room in the castle has seen a gruesome murder or two through the centuries. Enter Erika Blanc as a mysterious visitor. She instantly steals the whole show as she slinks and slithers her way about the castle, seducing the guests with their favorite vices. Each has a particular appetite that leads to their grisly downfall. Blanc is a succubus, a demon in the form of a drop-dead-gorgeous woman, who has come to the castle to feed her own burning hunger and please her true master ( hope you guessed his name). The only hope seems to be a priest who is able to resist her wiles, even when she's naked! This movie is my favorite Erika Blanc classic. She is great in her role, while the rest are passable. Add it to your collection, NOW!..."
2,Not Good,"Erika Blanc would have been wise to pass on this piece of work as im sure it helped kill an already mediocre career. Nothing happens in this film for the first 60 min. then everyone gets killed in the next 10 min. Sensual? yes, Entertaining? not even close. Euro trash is an apt description."
2,Waay overpriced!,I love Libby's pumpkin and use it for many recipes. Glad the shortage seems to be over. I just bought 6 cans of this (15 oz) at local supermarket for $1.79 each. Quite a difference!
3,Quality has gone downhill over the years,"I have been making pumpkin pies and other treats for years. And I have noticed how over the years that Libbys Pumpkin has become less and less dense, no doubt to keep the pricing and profit margins at a certain point. The problem is that I have to adjust my recipes so that the mix isn't so liquid. I have also complained to Libbys to no avail -- they simply issue the typical corporate lie as if they're responding to a first time user."
1,Sandy pumpkin,Just threw away 3 loaves of pumpkin bread that were gritty with sand. I checked on the internet and found others with the same complaint. What a waste!
2,"It's in the supermarket, even out of season","Don't order this just because you need canned pumpkin sometime other than Autumn. I bought this exact product in March at a regular grocery store. I have seen it at multiple stores since, including Walmart. It's only a dollar or two."
5,Pink Panther,I love this movie and I now have it on DVD. I love watching all of the Christmas moves during the Holidays and I'm a granmother.
4,Pink Panther Christmas,My Children absolutely love Pink Panther and this Christmas story will make you laugh and teach a wonderful meaning about what the Christmas season is to your children. We love it and it will be a constant classic to be played at our house every year.
5,I LOVE the Pink Panther!!,"I bought this DVD for only $0.92 from a merchant on here, and I have never seen this DVD before, but it was very entertaining!!! I'm so glad I bought it! I love the Pink Panther!!"
2,wouldn't buy,kids love pink panther but this isn't one I'd expense for. if you really want to watch pink panther invest in netflix so you can return it when done
2,I've seen better Pink Panther cartoons,"The Pink Panther cartoons were among my favorite growing up. This particular DVD is okay, but I would recommend just getting some of the classics instead. The cartoons on this felt a little contrived and I actually found myself getting bored watching them."
1,Not the video I thought I bought.,I thought this was the olympics video that I saw on television back in the 80s before the olympic winter games. It was not the same video.
4,Clever Pink Panther Special,"This video is wonderful! Although not top-notch Pink Panther humor, it still is a holiday delight. Cleverly animated, it's a lot of fun to watch and is a wonderful Christmas video."
4,A GREAT PINK CHRISTMAS,I bought this DVD because I am A big Pink Panther fan. I have slowly made my kids to like him and other of the classic cartoons. This dvd is not as good as the collection of all the shorts but it is a great add on if you want the whole collection of cartoons since these cartoons are not included with the box set. It Is great that it includeds the Valentine special and the special Olym-Pinks I believe all of the classics are now avaliabe on DVD.The Pink Panther - A Pink Christmas
5,Great for Christmas!,"Although I was a kid in the 60s, all the young children coming over to our house LOVE these Pink Panther DVDs as much as we did when they were on television. When I saw this one online, I HAD to have it and grabbed it quickly, since our local Giant Eagle store sold out of it during October, of all things, and never could get them back in stock before Christmas. Yes Virginia, the Panther is that popular! I was pretty surprised how popular he still is today and this Christmas one is hysterical. We love all the extra shows they've included as well, particularly Olym-Pinks and the Valentine's special. Just something nice to watch for a change that is funny, not overdone, and no violence (well, unless you count falling downstairs violence! :) Very funny, great for the upcoming Christmas season. Highly, highly recommend!"
4,"More mayhem, confusion, and clues to the Tall Man","Yesterday I picked up PHANTASM: OBLIVION. Any fan of the series should not miss this film. It is a faithful sequel, and it finally starts to explain just what in the heck has been going on for the past 3 movies, just don't expect much of an explanation. This is a definite ""Must See"" film for any phan out there. END"
1,Very dissapointed,"Big fan of the series. I thought part 4 was painful to watch. I could not wait until it was over, so I could go to bed. Wished I had not wasted my money or time."
1,Some things don't get better with time,"Well, it is a cold, wintry weekend in Montana and I was in a mood to see some horror flicks. So I rented both the original Phantasm in addition to this horrible film. Phantasm 4 is everything the first is not. There is no fear, no atmosphere, no action, no sense. The origin of the Tall Man is (sorta) revealed, but the revelation brings no resolution. Reggie continues to think with his little head instead of his big one, which explains why his lines are soooo bad. And Mike's role in the movie is incredibly vague; is he hero, victim, or the Tall Man's reluctant apprentice? I loved the first movie. Sure, it was no Academy Award winner, but it had some cool suspense and action. Unfortunately, each sequel gets progressively worse. Stick with the original and save your bucks; it was the only one in the series really worth seeing."
1,A Scrap book of meandering,"First off, if you have not seen the other films, don't even begin to waste you time with this one. It completely relies on the other 3 movies to tie the micro-thread of a story together. This movie is a mess. I've seen all 4 and by far this does nothing to the series except give very little history to the tall man. The pacing is horrible, the editing was done by who knows who. This movie is not a movie. It's just clips edited together. Such a waste."
2,what cares about plot,"I don't remember much about Part 4 other than the fact that there's not much action like in Part 2 & 3. It was really boring. And there wasn't hardly any special effects. I tend to purchase even bad horror sequel dvd's from the 70's, 80's, and 90's but this Part 4 Oblivion was so so bad that i never bought this in DVD."
4,Phantasm 4 hopefully not the final chapter,I just got finished watching the movie and I just want to say that I don't think that it lived up to the original but it was pretty good anyway. The only thing I didn't like about the movie is when they added in scenes to this movie using outtakes from the original Phantasm they just didn't seem to tie in to this movie. Also I would've liked for them to have explored the character of Jebidiah Morningside a little bit more. And for once I wished they could've at least finished the film on a happy note but once again the Tall Man! triumps over all.
4,Part IV was very good,This movie had clips from previous movies as well as unseen clips in previous movies that helped the story line. This movie had some short time travel scenes that helped tie up the history of the Tall man. Overall a good movie with good special effects.Brian
3,Phantasm 4:Oblivion,"I am not sure what others are looking for in the franchise, But I expected to be scared, The movie is not as scary as Part 1(the best of the series) , While I do think it's great all the players are in the movie as in the last one It doesn't make any sense,it seems they made ""The Tall Man"" soft."
4,The second best in the Phantasm series.,"For almost twenty years now, The Tall Man has destory many small town across america. The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) is ready to take over the world with his undead legions. The two determined heroes Micheal (A. Micheal Baldwin) & Reggie (Reggie Bannister) are trying hard to destory The Tall Man, once and for all before he takes over the world.Written and Directed by Don Coscarelli (Phantasm Series, Kenny & Company) made an terrific sequel that is better than the last two films of the Phantasm Series. DVD`s has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer & Pan and Scan is included. Strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The most interesting thing about Phantasm 4, is they used Deleted Footage from the first film to add plot to Phantasm 4. The best Phantasm film since the first. Grade:A-."
4,WIERD AND TWISTED!,"THIS MOVIE IS COOL.I LOVE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS.MICHEAL BALDWIN,REGGIE BANNISTER,BILL THORNBURY,HEDI MAURNHOUT,AND ANGUS SCRIMM MAKE THIS MOVIE WORK! MUST SEE PHANTASM 1,2,3!"
3,Kind of a waste.,"Seem to be working a very little bit, used for 7 months then it starter burning and head was itchy so I stopped using it."
3,An average treatment - many misprints and unstated assumptions.,"Unfortunately, Barber's Elasticity is marred by a good deal of errata and does not make clear important assumptions in several derivations, most notably in dealing with curved beams. There are better texts available on this subject."
5,Only Buy This Version!,"Thank goodness the Concord Music Group has the rights to Ray Charles' ABC Paramount catalogue ( which they are re-issueing with meticulous care and attention + bonus trax ). I've been waiting for the CD version of this album, having had my vinyl copy stolen, and purchased a copy from Amazon in France. I received the HALLMARK/Pickwick 2011 CD #710362. It turned out to be a bad transfer from a vinyl LP complete with clicks, pops and surface noise! Obviously they felt that was acceptable - since it was more than 50 years old and out of copyright. BE WARNED - do NOT buy this version, the CONCORD version is from the original tapes and has been re-mastered beautifully AND had seven bonus trax!! Boo Hiss to Hallmark/Pickwick who've had the nerve to put ""ORIGINAL RECORDING"" on the cover on their rip-off."
2,It sucks the soul right out of him,"The orchestrations and chorus present on all of the regular tracks intended to make him more palatable to a wider audience suck the soil right out of Ray Charles' performances. This is particularly evident when you hear the bonus tracks. The bonus tracks are fabulous, but I'm sure you can find them on another Ray Charles album."
1,Palomino book,I was really disappointed in this book. I would never order from this company again. It was so nasty that I could not stand to even read it. It was supposed to be in good shape. Linda Patton
4,One of the Better Steel Books,"Aside from the vulgar language (which I always hate), this book is extremely satisfying on most counts. The characters are likable, the story ends in a fashion which does not cheat the reader and moves along at a brisk pace. This is one of the better Steel books out there. I recommend this one if you are new to Danielle Steel."
5,Absolutaly Fantastic!,"It was a wonderful book! I just could't put it down untilI was finished with it! I re-read it about every month,and I still love it!"
3,I'm Glad I Didn't Pay For This...,"This was fun for my 4 year old for about 15 minutes.Yes, it does fold up, but not in a way that makes it very portable. It is also very hard to get the cars to launch. The launching ramp does not stand up on its own - you have to prop it up against something in a way that does not impede the child from being able to actually place the car in/on the ramp. Not as easy as you think.I'm glad that this was a gift and that I did not pay for it."
4,Easy Assembly,The children and I love this flip n go track! It is so easy to set up and take along wherever you want to go.
3,Good toy if you find it on sale,"My son got this for Christmas last year, it was the only thing he asked Santa for. It is ok, but if you don't find a great sale, I would pass on it."
3,Fun...but.....,"My 4 year old son received this as a gift...although he plays with it often, the batteries ran dead after a few days...unfortunately the batteries are watch size batteries that cost anywhere from $6.00 to $10.00 each (there are 3 of them)...so the batteries end up costing more than the entire toy! The larger hot wheel cars get stuck easy and it does not fold up conveniently as advertised. It will be in a garage sale in a few months..."
1,Move along - nothing to see here,"I was very dissapointed with this playset. the ramp never seems to work right, the toy is unstable, and realy is not much fun even when it works.This one made a quick trip to the scap heap."
2,PCMCIA 56K Modem,The modem itself was quite good. Unfortunately my dog chewed the cord and because the interface was not compatible with anything else I had to order a new modem.
3,Volleyball antennaes,The antennaes we received were somewhat as advertised. I had called customer service prior to ordering and asked if the velcro straps ran ALL the way from top to bottom of the antennae securing it to the net and was assured that it did. However the velcro are only small strips about 6 inches at the top and 6 inches at the bottom. This makes it difficult to attach to the net unless you use a stepladder or chair to secure the top velcro.
1,Not educational at all,First of all it's a waist of time and the quality of this dvd should have been remastered and the audio is terrible.
4,Rembrandt? Right On!,"One of the better editions of Rembrandt's etchings. If you are unfamiliar with his etchwork, this is a great place to start. Of course, ideally it is better to see them up close and in person, but that is not always possible. This book is definitely worth buying, and even serves as a coffee table book for friends to peruse when they visit."
4,good for older book print,"if you are looking for prints as crisp as the originals, you will be disappointed. There is a good selection of work and you can get a good idea of his line styles, use of space, etc,"
5,An incredible value,"Incredible simple, refined down to the content you want, great reproductions and a great price. If only there were more art books like this. (check out dover's complete durer as well - similar in quality)"
2,various artists,pure 70's is great. various artists are at the top of theirgame. DON'T BUY PURE 80's! unless you like new wave tone poems.
3,"More like ""Some 70's"".","If there's one thing harder to do than narrow down the 80's to one disc, it's doing that to the 70's. The truth is this collection could have had 400 different songs on it. Why these made the cut, who knows. I'll agree that most of these would be considered classic, but I think the average person is gonna already own a third of this disc, not care about a third, and be sick of the other third. I guess if you kept your CD collection under 20 discs, then this might do the trick. Good for a party, sure. Overall though, I'd probably just get an album from Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, or The Eagles. Where are they?"
5,WE REALLY LIKE IT,"WE REALLY LIKE THE VARIETY OF THE SONGS AND ARTISTS ON THIS CD. WE BOUGHT IT TOGETHER WITH ""THE BEST OF THE 70'S SUPERGROUPS"". THERE WERE ONLY A FEW SONGS DUPLICATED ON THESE TWO CD'S, BUT OVERALL WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE SONGS ON BOTH OF THESE CD'S."
5,He's got an ear for nice beats.,"For this producer to be a local, underground, artist, I think that this CD sounds great. The beats are off the hook! I love the way that he used a lot of different styles. There was only one song on there that I didn't care for. But, overall, I hope that Huggable makes it big. I think he's kinda cute too."
4,"Larnelle, The Father Hath Provided",Larnelle sets a high standard in gospel music and this collection is a fine example. Songs include:1. The Father Hath Provided Again2. Come Thou Almighty King3. Great Is Thy Faithfulness4. Greater Still5. I Give All My Life To You6. All In Favor7. Honor Him8. His Faithfulness9. Seekers Of Your Heart
4,Classic!,"Music isn't made like this today. Beautiful singing coupled with beautiful and heartfelt lyrics make this album a must by. Last track, ""Seekers of Your Heart"" is by far my favorite."
5,Learning with the Master,"The absolute genious of L. Bernstein drives us constantly to tears of emotional joy. Paraphrasing Dame Kiri te Kanawa ""...it's like having Mozart in front of you...""I've always been learning music with Bernstein especially when, as young piano student back in the 70', I watched astonished and marvelled at the ""Concerts for Young people"". I'll never forget his performance, as conductor and pianist, of Rhapsody in Blue (live in Paris) and his sublime interpretation (also as soloist and conductor) of Beethoven's 1st Piano concerto in Vienna."
4,Excellent but...,"This is an excellent DVD. I however was expecting what I had seen a few years back on PBS. In that version there was far more tension between Carreras and Bernstein. Carreras, whom I believe had just found out he had leukaemia, walked out in the middle of rehearsal after Bernstein picked him apart. Although there is not all that tension present in this DVD, it is still a good look inside the making of this recording. Watching the performance of the singers, musicians, and Bernstein is a far better treat then just listening to them on a CD. I do believe it has been whitewashed by removing a lot of the tense moments which is why I didn't give it 5 stars."
5,"Great music, great human interest","Aside from the wonderful performances, watching Bernstein in action is fascinating. He's the archetype of heroic conductor/leader."
3,West Side Story,When I first played this DVD it instantly became my favorite. The music is superb and it shows a lot of what it took to make music recordings before the digital age. My DVD was damaged and I am now orderring a replacement.
4,Intriguing Thriller,"Archer Mayor's The Sniper's Wife is a gripping thriller and an enjoyable, compelling read. I have never read any of Mayor's novels before, so I cannot compare them to the rest of the Joe Gunther series, but as a newcomer, I thought this novel was excellent. Willy Kunkle is a man haunted by a number of ghosts, and at the outset of the novel, he gets a new ghost--his ex-wife, who is found dead of an apparent heroin overdose in New York City. Kunkle immediately heads to New York from Vermont to identify the body, but is immediately pulled into finding out the true cause of her death. Things don't add up for Kunkle and he embarks on a one man mission to discover what really happened. The novel reads like one of the better Law and Order episodes--you won't be able to put it down. Enjoy."
4,Can't loan this book!,"The story would get five stars but this book can't be loaned. What's up with that, Archer? The more expensive the book, the less likely it is to be loanable!"
5,A gift to my 16 yr old,"I bought this book back in 2003 for my daughter, who at the time was around 7 and was familiar with the lyrics to the song. Well after her father and I split up, the book, which was a paperback copy was lost while moving. I saw it on Amazon and discovered the hardback was available. I ordered it, received it and wrapped it up for her as a Christmas present, hoping she would remember the book. On Midnight, Christmas morning, she opened it....not only did she remember it, she cherishes it and was a little emotional about receiving the gift. Thanks for making this possible !!!"
2,not her best,"I've read other Georgia Beers books that I really enjoyed but this just wasn't one of them. The premise behind the story line wasn't bad, and the throwback references to lesbian culture of a decade or so ago were actually something I enjoyed, but the editing and the way this book was put together just about ruined it for me. I thought at first maybe I was just being picky, but it just got worse for me as the book went on. This may sound silly, but practically the ONLY descriptor of the characters is ""the older woman"" or ""the younger woman"". After awhile, I was laughing every time I read those phrases. An editor should have caught this. I also really disliked the subplot of the father and daughter both falling for the same woman. Kind of creepy. Read Georgia Beers. She's a good author, but skip this title. It misses the mark. A new edition with some additional editing could improve it significantly."
3,Not Nearly As Good As Her Other Books,"I like this author and have read her other books. I loved ""Thy Neighbor's Wife,"" ""Starting from Scratch,"" and ""Too Close to Touch."" She missed the mark with this book, however. First, I didn't find the main character, Melanie, to be very well developed. Second, the writing seemed amateurish (particularly as compared to her other work) and the story quite predictable. Finally, unlike her other books, I felt the author was less invested in these characters and thus I was as well. I'm glad this was not the first book I read by the author; otherwise, I would have stayed away from her other work, which would have been a pity."
3,Been There,"I found this book rather ho-hum,like so many others, lack of imagination, lack of knowledge, etc...So many people assume they know someone, without first looking at ALL the facts. Judging,thinking they are so intelligent, they know all the answers.... my, my, how wrong they are. If they only knew...the joke is on them!! ha!ha!. Like, how do they know for SURE that the other person wasn't playing a game? Told them anything they wanted to hear? Maybe they were bored?, it was just something to do?? Amazing how some people get it ALL wrong. Oh well....I have been in that situation before."
4,Covers technique & basic gear for beginner/intermediate.,"This was the first book I bought after purchasing my kayak. It covers the gear you will need for paddling, safety and clothing. As well as discussing basic paddling and bracing strokes, a number of rescue techniques are covered, including the roll. Armed only with what I learned from the 8 pages on the eskimo roll, I went out and had myself rolling in two days. The book also include a chapter on family and handicapped paddling.There is little coverage of extended or overnight trips."
4,"Cheap, but a good deal at the price","My son kicks soccer balls at it, and it seems to resist them pretty well. He's been using it for some months and it's held up. He's 10 and kicks quite hard (e.g., can loft a corner kick to the far post). It's cheap in both senses; I thought about using it for golf practice as the ad suggests, but I'm not convinced it would stand up. But it works great for soccer."
2,Not Expensive - but Worth Even Less --- WHY?,"At $39 buck, this is neither the cheapest or most expensive. But the quality is typical . Made in China stuff. Nice box, but the stuff inside is Junk Quality, parts are loose and flimsy. Worth only $19.99 in my mind, so this only a 2 Star rating.Setting up the Net, was easy but the stretch line holding everything together BROKE. I should have taken the Product back for exchange, but I repaired it. I give this product a few months of use, before it falls apart. Also, sticking it in the ground was difficult. It should have a GRAB handle or foot support to assist applying pressure to stick it deep in the ground. HOLDING the shaft with you hands and pushing is not easy ... dumb design. Too Basic for a $40 buck.** Star"
4,Does the job,"The practice net replaced a similar product. I have been very happy with it. First, it was very easy to put up out of the box. Secondly, a good drive would sometimes go thru the netting of the old net. Not with this one. I would recommend purchasing some PVC pip; cut two lengths of about 12""; drive them into the turf. Insert each end into the PVC pipe.It works well."
1,Piece of Crap,This is a total hunk of junk. Does not stay in the upright position and is poorly made. DO NOT BUY
4,Better than Bauer,"I used to buy my polos from EB, but since they started manufacturing all of theri products overseas the quality sank to the depths. This is a great replacement in both fit and quality."
5,Great shirt,"Great shirt, had it for a week and it fits well, is comfortable, and looks just like it seems in the picture.It is exactly what I was looking for."
1,Not a good study tool!,"Ok, I got this book to study for an grad school entrance exam. It was not worth the money. There are NO answers provided for the question. Although, each part of organic chemistry is divided into sections of questions, there are still NO answers for the questions. The book gives 'hints' which are absolutly unhelpful to the reader. Look for another study guide, and don't get this one, you will be disappointed."
2,A bit irritating,"We are fans of Kutless, however, the experience of this event is rather annoying and irritating. We like the studio versions of Sea of Faces, Better is One Day among others better than these live versions. Also, as someone else mentioned, the screaming is irritating and the lead singer exhorting the crowd to ""go crazy"", ""jump up and down"" and other silly suggestions is completely unnecessary and juvenile."
3,"LIve, but Staged","I enjoyed the music on this album when the lead singer was not directing the crowd to ""go crazy"", ""on your feet"", ""put your fist up"". Seems the band was so concerned about having a good reaction for the DVD video, that the music suffered. The lead singer uses tonight way too much during discussion times.The music is good, but I would rather that it speak for itself- just play hard and let folk enjoy."
3,Nice shoe,"Ordered this shoe for my friend. The package arrived quick, however, when we opened the shoe box, the shoe looked a lot pinker than the picture."
5,DIRTY HARRY WITH A TWIST!,"Great story line. (No romance.) Harriet is a kick-butt former ""Boca Babe"" turned P.I. who takes on her first murder case. She ""took care"" of her abusive, rich husband, sells off all her ""bling"", moves to the Everglades and rides her Harley everywhere. Harriet starts acting like ""Dirty Harry"" and takes charge of her life. She uncovers a fertility clinic's ""wombs-for-arms"" deal between migrant working women and the rich women of Boca Raton, Florida. I loved her way of thinking and I wanted to BE her! She told things like they were: (Here's how you tell the Boca Babe aspirants from the arrivals: It's not a matter of artificial versus authentic, it's the quality of the artifice. The wannbe's bleached blond hair has dark roots and split ends, their artificial nails are press-on rather than silk wrap and their makeup is sparkly rather than subtle. But the fake boobs are the same.) Also the TWTW Club: Trolls With Trophy Wives! I laughed out loud at some of her observations!"
5,Leary at his best,"I've been a fan of Denis' for some time (since his standup in the late 80's/early 90's) and this is by far my favorite performance.""The Ref"" does a great job - through witty dialog, a fast pace, and some excellent performances - of exposing the ordeal modern holidays have become. It's a fun yarn in which the aggressive con-man and thief vents his frustrations onto a dysfunctional family, who actually use the brutal honesty coerced out of them to learn to live better together. It's an overused premise, but I can't recall having more fun in watching a straightlaced, pompous, pretentious family being taught morals by a foulmouthed felon.Watch this movie once and it will become a tradition every year."
4,Leary is at his best,"good Denis Leary movie with him taking a family(Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey) hostage so the police wont find him. a good comedy, mostly on Leary's part, he's oh so likable in hatable parts and Davis and Spacey are wacky hostages who drive Leary to the extreme. funny and crazy at the same time. for diehard Leary fanatics"
4,Foul Mouth,I didn't care much for this movie . It did have a few funny spots but way too many F bombs for kids . Not a good Holiday movie for the younger ones. Dennis Leary plays a crook & a jerk . Best part is the Holiday dinner scene. Adults would like this..
3,liked it with reservations,"It was a funny movie, but using the F word was a little too much. It didn't need it , in fact it took away from the overall story. It definitely would be very funny without it."
4,hapless burgler takes fueding couple hostage and pays for it,"Some critics called it hysterically funny. Not quite. But it is witty, entertaining and with some surprises. The characters are unpleasant but not irredeemable. When everyone gets theirs just deserts, it is the end.Merry Christmas."
3,An amusing diversion,"Dennis Leary was quite good in this, as were Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis. There were some great ""gags"" -- particularly the scene at the dinner table when they are all forced to wear the candle crowns-- and the premise was unique. But some of it was predictable and the characters of the extended family members were a bit too broad and stereotypical. Still, fun to watch."
2,No likey...,This movie had high hopes because I like Dennis O'Leary and Kevin Spacey. I has a headache within 20 minutes of listening to the couple argue. O/Leary had some funny lines but far and few between.
5,Love it!,"Not quite the Christmas classic as ""A Wonderful Life"", but the holida season just wouldn't be the same without this in my collection!"
2,Full frame DVD - not widescreen,"This is a fairly old and cheaply made DVD with a poor transfer. It's grainy and washed out, but the worst is that it's not an anamorphic transfer, so you get no 16x9 option. Watching this DVD on a modern widescreen TV is painful, because you just get a small image floating in the middle of your television. I wish I had looked into the transfer issues - this is a great Christmas movie, with an awesome cast.I would not recommend this for owners of large widescreen TVs. Even on an old 4x3 CRT, the transfer is fairly poor. The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is adequate."
5,EXCELLENT,This video is a classic for Denis Leary fans. His self comes thru amazing well. A must see for Denis Leary fans.
1,Sucks,This was not DVD or Bluray compatable came from England and completly worthless and I bought two copies. Lesson learned!
4,Funny with good acting and laugh out loud moments,A really surprising funny film from start to finish. I really liked all the charactors in the film. I felt really sorry forn Dennsi Leary's characots and Judy Dvis and Keven Spacey are great. The supporting cast are scean stellers. The film has many laugh out loud moments and the film is great.
1,No Sound,I tried to run this movie several times and each time there was no sound. It was a shame because I really liked the movie and was looking forward to seeing it again.
2,Saw this movie prior to my order and liked it,"Saw this movie on TV prior to my ordering it from Amazon and really liked the movie. Unfortunately, when I ordered itso that I could have a copy for myself, It came damaged and I had to return it. But I highly recommend this movie to anyoneinterested in a nice, lite holiday comedy."
1,You'll love this movie if...,"If your idea of a good time is revisiting the most bitter and petty fights you've ever had with your husband or wife over and over again with the extra-added-bonus of a third person (""the ref"") repeatedly interupting with helpful advice like ""shut up you morons"" - you will just love this movie."
5,Great movie,"Is the Ref a christmas movie? Yes. Is the first Die HArd a christmas movie, no. The ref incorporated Christmas throughout the entire movie and even demonstrated the Christmas spirit at the end of the movie."
4,One of my favorite Christmas movies.,"With Denis Leary, you know it won't be all sweetness and light and Silent Night. Far from it! But Leary's character is a criminal who is more bluff than bite. But his bluff is just what this dysfunctional family needs."
5,"Oooh, cool...","I've never seen a bad review of this movie. I've loved it since the first time I saw it.Indeed, all of the characters are ideally cast and the writing is sharp enough to make you bleed. My favorite line is when Lloyd tells his mother he'll buy her a cross so she can nail herself to it. (I can't remember it verbatim, but you know what I'm talking about.)I'm just glad they've finally begun to produce it on this format so I can add it to my collection!"
4,Watch...and repeat,"This is one of my favorite movies. Even thouth I own the original, I still find myself tuning it in when it comes on TV. One of those movies you enjoy more each time you watch it. Everyone plays their part perfectly. I never thought too much about Dennis Leary until seeing him in this wonderful movie. I hope he can find more movies roles that match his talents as well as this one does."
4,FAMILY FAVORITE,"Some movies don't get old. During the holidays, this is one our family love to watch. It's funny every time!"
3,Holiday Hell in Connecticut,"This film, while not the greatest of holiday fare, is an above average film. The plot of a modern-day suburban Bickerson couple being held hostage in their own home has hilarious moments, with Denis Leary showing a brilliant sense of timing. Judy Davis is sharp and caustic, but still tosses some real zingers. Kevin Spacey, not nearly well known enough for his comedy, is simply terrific. While the end becomes kind of a Hollywood formula, the evolution of the relationship between Davis & Spacey is very nice and they play off each other well. This is definitely not ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but its probably more representative of the disfunctional family in all of us...."
3,Fun Concept Never Quite Pans Out,"Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey match wits in this ever-so-gently whitewashed holiday staple. Spacey, whose flammable relationship with wife Judy Davis takes center stage in nearly every scene, is at his deadpan sarcastic best from start to finish, while Leary's brand of comedy is somewhat neutered by the family-friendly nature of the picture. At its root, though, this is a startlingly simple premise that never really evolves into something grand enough to carry a feature-length picture. It's got some good one-liners, a few solid recurring gags, a volatile core concept, but can't manage to make the shift into high gear that would've put it over the top."
2,"More Love, A Lot Less ""ghost writer.""","great story of Love, but Ron Hoerburger, the ghost writer tries way too hard. No life is as polished, no set of anecdotes as yucked up or tidy as he presents them. More of Love and a lot less of Hoerburger would have made a far better book. You're not supposed to see the ghostwriter's presence as you constantly do in this boook, that's why they're call ""ghost"" writers- they're suposed to fade into the background, not try to upstage the star like Hoerburger does here."
5,Great battery at a great price,I purchased this battery to replace the battery in a Belkin UPS. The battery was delivered on time. The cost was a lot less than I had expected. So far the battery works great. I consider this battery a very good value.
1,"The book, like its victim, is dismembered.","Unlike some others, I will never put Brown in the same league as Agatha Christie. Brown is so sophomoric in comparison. If you want to read a really good mystery, read Christie. If you want to be merely entertained by a mystery, read Lilian Jackson Braun's ""The Cat Who..."" series. Braun is a better writer than Brown. She even has a better imagination. If you want purely escapist fare in your mysteries then Brown is precisely the ticket you want. In this particular novel, Brown took a perfectly good idea or two and proceeded to be perfectly mediocre in her treatment of it."
2,wasn't exactly thrilled...,"Being a fan of the Lilian Jackon Braun mysteries, and the Mitford Series, I thought I'd give these books a try for some ""light reading"" after seeing them displayed in Wal-Mart. I'm attracted to books about small-town living, animals, mysteries, you get the idea.I only read 3 chapters and decided not to finish. There was an large use of profanity, both from the human and animal characters. Not just common swear words, but ones that would get Ralphie's mouth washed out with soap (referring to the movie, ""The Christmas Story""). If the use of these words had been less frequent, I could've overlooked them and continued reading, but they appeared too frequently for my taste. The level of frequency was something I'd expect from ...well I don't know - I don't read books with lots of swear words.Sorry, but I won't be recommending these mysteries to anyone I know."
3,"Review of ""Rest in Pieces""","Although I love the Sneaky Pie Brown series, this was was pretty grim. The murders were done in a horrific way and while I always enjoy Mrs. Murphy, the tiger cat, Pewter, the overweight gray cat and T. Tucker, the Corgi, I passed this on to a box ""Books for Charity"" because I knew I would not be re-reading it. The test of a book for me is at some point in the future, will I re-read it and I knew I would not want to on this one."
2,"Dull, dull, dull!!","While I admire the historical background of this novel, I couldn't believe how unbearable dull it was! I couldn't believe this was written by the same man who wrote LIBERTY TAVERN, THE OFFICERS' WIVES and THE SPOILS OF WAR. What a disappointment!"
3,Jackson to Lincoln,"A nation struggles to reconcile its desires to be both good and powerful. A woman drifts between two men, one basically good, one basically after power. I preferred Flemming's account, of a few fictional characters roles World War I in his novel ""Over There"", to this book. I know others have found his work to be somewhat less complelling than what they are accustomed to, but I enjoy the story he weaves around historical events and characers. Based on the two books I have read, having an interest in history seems to be a prerequisite to enjoy Flemming's work. If you struggle to identify the key issues of the presidency of Van Buren, Tyler or Polk, this book will be informative. The characters are a bit insular, and their development takes a back seat to history at times. However, I appreciate Flemming's work and find it to be a good blend of the issues of the past and the character flaws in people."
4,Stephen King sure is original,"Some horror movies are just meant to be a fun movie to watch, and this one definitely fits into that catagory. It was a very original take on the whole dracula story."
3,Night Flier,This is truely a vampire lovers movie . A vampire travels by private plane to airports to kill and leave his mark . Great ending . New look for a vampire
3,Worth Checking Out!,"Saw movie on tv one night. At first I thought, 'well, this is another vampire movie, with a twist, and a lame movie at that', but it was creepy enough to keep me watching, and then it really took off! I'm a horror film fan, but not a gore fan. In this case, it's worth sitting through for the bloody bite! King's story line is good, the movie is mostly schlock horror, but trust me, if you love horror, you must see this."
2,Not scary .,"I was sure by watching this movie and after reading the story, that I won't certainly get scarred but who knows with Stephen King. The theme of a vampire in a plane sounds quite dumb. I will say it is finally a OK movie even if it is not scarry at all. Wait until it's on TV to watch it !"
1,Delusion,"Plenty of expectations, party because of the rating, partly because of King's involvement, then it totally let me down..."
1,"Oh, Stephen, Stephen, Stephen......","I believe it was Captain Kirk who said that genius cannot operate on an assembly line. The good captain was correct, and, unfortunately, Mr. King's recent projects are excellent evidence of this. All of the fundamentals of good fiction are violated in this movie. The ""heroes"" are so totally flawed that it is impossible to develop any real sympathy for them, so you end up not caring when the crap goes down at the end. The plot is poorly paced and boringly repetitive. The final result seems to be a commentary on how bad paparazzi-type jounalists are, instead of what it could have been: a rousing story of a pair of journalists on a merry hunt to find a vampire. Also, wayyy too much blood and gore. Whoever produced this disappointing film should watch the original ""Haunting"" to see how a good horror movie is done. My advice? Let ""The Night Flier"" crash into the sea of obscurity, there to be lost forever."
5,NIGHT FLIER,"NOT BAD MOVIE. THE ACTING WAS GOOD LOCATIONS PRETTY GOOD. WHAT A SCARY CREATURE, GREAT MAKE UP JOB. THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE IN YOUR COLLECTION. I RATE IT A 8. YOU WILL FEEL SORRY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIED. BAD WAY TO GO."
1,One of the bad adaptation of Stephen King novels,"This movie contains no suspense and horror at all. The special effect or make-up is nothing. The vampire looks 100 percent fake. He looks exactly like a man with a mask on his face!There are much better horror movies which made me shudder. They are: Slither, Cabin Fever, 28 days later, Pet Semetery, The Mist (2008) and the Grudge."
5,This movie will scare you to death!!,"This is one of the best horror films I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of scary stuff. I have been a long time Stephen King fan. I have never seen so much blood in one movie. The suspense just leads you on. If you are scared of flying, don't watch this. I would reccomed this movie to anyone who wants to get really scared"
3,Not the greatest book,I love the video and the exercises that go along with the video are wonderful. But the book on the other hand is poorly written. Several signs are wrong or outdated. Many signs are drawn in such a way that it could be confused with other signs. Since there are no labels marking what word the model is signing there is no way to figure out the authors intent.
2,Good book if you have a teacher,If you have a teacher this book is fine but isn't good for self learning. Would of liked captions under each sign so it could be a better reference while on your own.
3,Not a bad book.,Nothing wrong with the book I'm just not very good in signing. Problem is i don't know any one who uses sign language. I find that many deaf people stay within their community and keep to themselves. I can write a dissertation on why this is but it would only be guess work on my part. Book was good and in good condition.
3,Waiting for the good part....,"I'm a little over halfway through this book ( a used copy I bought for 25 cents) and I don't understand the 5-star ratings given by others.The plot is OK and the ending might turn out as a surprise, but golly, the writing is really horrid. Character descriptions are overblown and minor characters are needlessly described in excruciating detail. In a nutshell, the writing quality is sophomoric. I've considered just tossing my 25-cent investment in the trash, but maybe I'll suffer through the rest and see how this ends."
3,lost and found,darcy is the main character in the story and she has one friend in the beginning of the story and the end she ends up with alot of more friends because she doesn't act stuck up and doesn't judge people anymore. there father left his wife and two kids and ran off to new york with a younger lady because he said no man in his family lived to see fifty. darcys and jamee grandmother is very ill after her stroke. jamee starts to date bobby an older guy who talks about her to his friends. darcy tries tries to tell her. when darcy was left at the tidal pool she saw a silver toyota following her she she calls the police and the man was her dad. this hurts jamee very much so she runs away to one of her favorite memorys. darcy and her dad finds jamee and imediately rushes her to the hospital. where their dad and mom talk about what happend and about them.
4,A Character You Can Care About,"In Lost and Found Darcy deals with problems that many teenagers face - friends, school, younger sisters, single working mom. But she also has the added burden of living with and caring for a grandmother she loves who is suffering from dementia. She must handle her anger and hurt regarding a father that left the family five years before. Then, there's the stalker who shows up in unusual places. Is he the one who left the threatening note?I jumped right into this story and worried about how Darcy would survive all of these problems. The obstacles were realistic, as were the solutions, which didn't come quickly or easily.I think this book is a wonderful read for its intended audience - teens who want a quick read that they can get lost in.I received this book in a giveaway from the Goodread's First Reads program."
4,ok,these work ok but since the pic showed 2 products i thought id get both i didnt read the fine print..
4,Debut album shows its respectability,"As a debut album, this band surely exceeds that of the typical expectations. Dark lyrics and enchanting musical talent provide for a amazing album. This album is a great display of beautiful music, mixed with stunning vocals. Each track has its own unforgettable story. Though this band has been compared to others such as; Evanescence, Lacuna Coil and The Gathering, they surly do not fit the form, they exceeds it. Unfinished Thought is original and shows that music can still be beautiful."
4,Power Lite,"The Ugly Stik Lite has the features you love in the Ugly Stik but is thinner and lighter with lots of line guides and a cork grip. Still very strong, but not a sensitive as some IM6 rods. I use my 4'-6"", 5' and 5'-6"" rods to fish for trout in small rivers. A great rod for the price."
5,"Great product, great service.","The belts were brand new, just as described and were delivered very promptly to Australia."
1,The Maze,This book was not very interesting. It was really confusing. It was about a boy named Rick who to a detention center for throwing rocks at a stop sign. If you want to get bored then read the Maze. ( It might be interesting to you it is an adventure book!!!!!!!!)
4,Boxes,"Ii liked this book beacuse it was a action packed thriller.Ii liked the part when the little creatures jumed out of the box and hide in the dark ,that part scared me alot. I also liked the part when when the girl opened the box even though it was seeled shut by metal.This book was so scary and good i never put it down. I hope they make a sequal."
3,Iced3g's Review,The Maze WAs a very action packed book. It was about a boy that ran away from a detention center which I thought was very cool. The reason why I gave this book a 3 star rating is because the plot of the book was not that good. I would recomend this book to someone that likes action and adventure books.
4,the maze,This book is a good book to learn from for foster kids and not foster about how you can still follow your dreams no matter what the problem
4,Really Good Western,"Really appreciate a good western and this one qualifies. Originally viewed on Netflix 10/2011,liked it so much I decided to add it to my film library. The story is about an american legend who seeks revenge against men who stole his poker winnings. This may sound a bit boring but the story-line had much more to offer. Doc developed good relationships with the townspeople including the sheriff played by Paul Sorvino just by doing ""the right thing"". He befriended and defended a very young man who was being abused for starters. Of course the movie is not without action.Terrence Hill plays the lead role. Was not familiar with him but loved his accent, not bad to look at either. He did a great job."
3,It's a western.,"I like westerns and I got my money's worth. This isn't ""Shane"" or ""High Noon"" but it's a western so ti was okay."
1,low down dirty disappointment,I ordered the movie and something felt different to me. I put the dvd in and of course it's the WRONG format. Wasted my money.
5,I ve always like this movie but it was in very very good condition think nabout how old it is but good,that a good movie funny and action that was one of the good ones this is one of jada good and funny you should get this one
5,One of my favorites,"This movie is hilarious. I can watch over an over again. Jada Pinkett, at the time, was adorable and super sassy! Some of my favorite movie lines ever and a great sound track. Combining comedy and violence??? this one hangs with the best - Beverly Hills Cop, Rush Hour etc..."
3,Average but mildly amusing time killer.,"Amusing comedy homage to blacksploitation films, should collapse under its own premise but doesn't. Due largely to the chemistry between the cast, and the comic skills of the elder Wayans the film actually allows you to sit through it. Throw in a sassy Jada Pinkett and whoever that Pochohontas chick is and it's at least watchable. Convoluted plot has Wayans as an ex-cop who has a chance for redemption by taking down a drug lord and a bad cop, the guy from Roc. 20 million dollars of the drug lords money being stolen by Keenan's ex, blah blah blah. Not a lot of laugh out loud type moments, but a few smirkers despite Jada's constant head and finger wagging."
1,Irredeemably awful.,"If someone stopped me in the street and asked me to name a bad film,I would'nt have much trouble saying this one.How did it ever happen?The mind boggles. The story is pathetic,the action scenes are despairable and the comicness is atrocious. Not even recommended for the easiest of viewers to satisfy."
5,A really fun movie. I've watched it over a dozen times,"A Low Down Dirty Shame is a great movie that pays homage to the blaxploitation films of the 70's. Keenan Ivory Wayans does a great job of mixing action and humor in this cool detective story about a PI looking for $20 million in stolen drug money. The supporting cast is very good here; Jada Pinkett and Salli Richardson aren't just eye candy, they give good performances too. However the only fault is with the film is Charles S. Dutton who overacts as usual. ALDDS is a great popcorn movie that will leave you smiling. Definitely buy it."
4,fine short novel,"Written in 1870, when Trollope was at the height of his powers, Sir Harry Hotspur is a moving story of greed, courtship, and conflicting emotions. The story is simple. Harry Hotspur is immensely wealthy. He has lost his son, leaving him with just a daughter for as heir to his fortune. His daughter loves a low life cousin who wants her money. The financial troubles of the cousin, and the emotional conflict between father and daughter create the drama of this fine short novel."
4,Comforting,"The Pazzazz label usually offers good quality recordings for relatively little expense. The production quality, however, is bare bones. On this set, there is no documentation of the sources of the recordings, or any listing of Armstrong's backup musicians. Most of the vocal duets are credited, although there is the notable omission of two duets with Billie Holiday. In general, these are serviceable monaural recordings, with a few substandard exceptions, that appear to be taken from broadcast performances. Armstrong is on good form throughout, and his duets with Holiday, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, and Jack Teagarden are quite delectable. There is a lot of fine trumpet playing, although just about every track features an Armstrong vocal. In sum, if the price is right (I got my copy for $4.) and the limitations of the documentation don't bother you, this is a very easy way to obtain some top flight entertainment from Satchmo."
3,i guess spending a week in college is a big deal for the hip hop crowd,"What separates West is that he sings about things more interesting than hookers and guns. His story about how 'he came up' is, well boring and mundane. He got lucky plus was talented. So what. His take on the whole diamond mining complex is right on point. But does he live it?Rapper need a hook, bandage under the eye, etc. West's hook is the whole student/backpack thing. It is pathetic that being a college dropout is a remarkable thing for the hip hop fanbase. As if this is a remarkable or interesting characteristic. I guess more kids need to put their iPods down and hit the books, or this would not seem so interesting like 'WOW, he went to college!'."
2,Kanye cannot Flow!!!,"Kanye should stick to just making compilation albums with other rappers rhyming over his beats. I give 2 stars because Kanye has some hot beats, but his Flow is wack! Ive always noticed he uses that ur and dur type words for rhyming. Kanye please stick to producing, thats were you shine best. Start signing some cats to your record label and get that doe! peace!"
2,The case came broken,"The case came broken from the inside. Fortunately, the CD was in great condition.I did not call back for a new case because I was going to download it into my laptop."
5,amazing,"kanye west is one, if not the, best producer out right now and adding jon brion to this album adds another element to the production. kanye is also one of the best lyrical rappers out there and if u dont think so listen to diamonds, touch the sky, or roses. if u dont think this album is at least 4 stars u dont know wat good music is."
1,Sucks horribly,"Go away Kanye and 50, we need those spaces for the next flavor of the month rappers.I can't stand Kanye. Seems he didn't study hard enough in college because he sounds like an ignorant idiotTo reviewers like O. Rose(who pretends that he/she is black and is from NOLA), shut up you morons. What kind of dumbass types in ebonics?"
1,Shoulda been later!,was expecting more from kanye's sophmore album but didnt live up to its hype theres like only 3 cool songs on the cd 2 beings his singles.
1,Don't like him,"Kanye West is very arrogant and needs to come off his high horse! He acts as if somebody owes him something. I don't like him as a person, so naturally i don't like his music. Never have and never will. The way he starts behaving around Grammy time makes me sick. What is his favorite saying"" If I dont win it's going to be problems""! Dude your music aint all that and on top of that he samples alot! Come up with your own stuff instead of using everybody's stuff from the old school. Late registration was listened to while i was riding with my boyfriend in his car and I only liked one song:1. Drive slow ( i love paul wall)Kanye needs to realize that there a alot of talented artists that don't always win the Grammy's even though they deserved it, For example India Arie she deserved all 9 of them grammys she was nominated for, but she didn't even win not a one, but you didn't see her acting stupid!"
3,Too Bad Rappers Get Rich! When they do they STINK...theyallcalljj@aol.com,Kanyes first release was a masterpiece. This album was not Kanyes best Effort. Too Bad Rappers Get Rich.Once the rapper gets rich they rap about crap.well thats just my opinion.Moses
1,one word.....garbage,"Ever had blood profusely Oozing from your ears???? Well if you haven't and want to experience it, buy the Late Registration cd. I would rather pay $15 to watch 4 monkeys hump a football than EVER listen to another track from this CD again. You know those times where you just need a hug from mom, well after I listened to this CD it was one of those times. So in all, grabbing some 100 grit sandpaper and rubbing one out till bleeding or chaffing occurs would be more pleasurable than listening to this CD. To bad this cocky racist did not get washed away by hurricane Katrina!!!"
2,"Dope Production, but come on","First off, yea hes a fantastic producer, and he should have stuck to doing that, because when he opens his mouth nothing but ego comes out in the form of lacking ryhmes... hey at least this album he stopped doing that hurr, thurrr, sturr thing that was on his first cd. But people praise his production like it was a gift of god, but if you mention rj2d, j dilla, madlib, or blockhead they look at you like you whack.The dude belows got it right, though im not sayng I dont own a few mainstream joints, people gotta stop liftin people like this up.last comment is i find it funny that a dude who grew up middle class thinks he has a right to rap about poverty and violence because hes black, if you poor you poor, those people are the only ones who should be rapping that."
3,Kanye...eh...,"Alright, well, I took the time out to seriously listen to this CD...and what I found was horrendous.Before you fully read what I have to say, i will state that I don't tend to like Kanye West as a rapper, but He's a great producer, I'll admit that. I don't tend to like the majority of the material Kanye tries to rap about, nor do I like Kanye as a person.That being said, I found a lot of ""ringtone"" beats on here...I really hated the beats that Kanye chose for this album, and it obstructed my view of the album. As much as I wanted to, i couldn't look at the lyricism by itself, the beats just totally took it awayHowever, when I finally did manage to hear his lyrics, I found an array of nice tracks, and extremely wack songs.If you're serious into hip hop, i will not reccomend this. If you're all about commercial and mainstream RAP...go for it."
5,KANYE HIT IT,"I can't even describe this album. I was always a huge fan of Kanye because I felt that not only did he have good beats, but his words are amazing. There's no other way to describe it..you just have to take a chance and get it."
4,Great album with a few flaws,"This album is one of the best I've heard in a while. I beleive its better then ""College Dropout"" but thats just me. Thought I only gave this album 4 stars just because:1. Kanye West is a dick.2. ""Gold Digger"" is over-played on the radio and MTV.Other than that...Its tight."
4,Jon Brion adds a lot,"I'm not a big fan of most hip hop out there, but this is an awesome album. Jon Brion added a lot with the music behind the raps, and the rhymes themselves are awesome. A few of the songs in the middle seem to drag on a little aimlessly, but none aren't worth listening to. If there were half stars on here, I'd give this 4.5 stars."
3,Great album,"Kanye West put himself in a very difficult situation of trying to top his solo smash CD ""The College Dropout"". Although ""Late Registration"" is a great CD in itself, and definitely worth picking up, its not on par with his previous effort. ""The College Dropout"" is one of the rare CDs that can be put on let play through the end. A timeless classic indeed. I do however still recommend ""Late Registration"", as West continues to try to follow his formula of clever lyrics and ketchy beats. The standout songs on the album are ""Heard Em Say"", ""Diamonds"", ""Gold Digger"" and my personal favorite off the album, ""Crack Music"". If you enjoyed ""Dropout"", go pick this up."
2,Well ...,"Kanye done lost his humility.For how hypocritical he is on this whole album, at least he didn't drop another 'Christian' track. This album won't get confused again with a ""best gospel album"" like Dropout was at the Stellars."
5,Kanye is THE TRUTH,"Kanye is a revolution. This CD is about music as much as it is about the message. Please listen to the lyrics. He is a young black person living in America AND he writes about what he sees, views, hears and experiences. He's REAL. If you dont like Kanye - YOU CAN NOT HANDLE TO TRUTH."
3,"Good, but the first one is better...","Ok, I'm not a huge Kanye fan, so here is your UNBIASED review folks... this is a pretty good CD, don't get me wrong. Why people are giving it 5 stars and calling it the best CD of the year is beyond me, though... sorry, it's just not. Kanye has some thoughtful lyrics, a unique style, and is a really good producer. But as far as rapping, he's only slightly above average. If you wanna hear someone spit pure fire pick up the new Twista instead. College dropout was much better than this one, this is his ""sophomore effort"" in every sense. Don't get me wrong, it's a good CD. Just not GREAT like everyone is making it out to be. Personally I'd rather download it than pay for it, sorry."
1,Totally overrated krap,"What's the deal with West? A case of the emperor's new clothes? The guy is a decent producer, but as an ""artist,"" he sucks big time. I mean, really. He can't sing, can't rap, can't put a basic melody together. If you ever see him perform on TV, it's just awful, really embarrassing, you want to look away, but you can't, like a car accident. There are so many other worthy, talented performers out there just waiting to be supported on radio, in record stores, and online. Don't give another dime to Kanye's alread-bloated wallet. He doesn't deserve it. My CD will now function as a drink coaster. This is tuneless, flat, tired garbage sold as ghetto-fab lifestyle on MTV as per usual. Ka-ching."
1,Dont believe the hype-,"Whoa Whoa Whoa!!! When did everyone jump on the Kanye West bandwagon?? Dont get me wrong, I think his first album is tremendous and still listen to it constantly. But I honestly wasnt impressed with first single ""Diamonds (From Sierra Leone)"" and apparently neither were many fans. The song did not do well and I thought oh well. Then when the album was released and critics hailed it as possibly the best album of the year, followed by the release of ""Gold Digger""; I changed my mind immediately and bought the album. Expecting songs that jump out like ""Digger"" and even stuff similiar to 'College Dropout' I was highly disappointed from the first spin. With exceptions like ""Touch the Sky""(ft Lupe Fiasco) and ""Digger"", I found myself hitting the skip button more than the play button on my stereo; not even Jay-Z's appearance on the album could help this one out. So go ahead, throw a hissy fit like Kanye at the Grammy's, but I'm telling you this: Don't believe the hype!"
3,"Late Registration, Good, not a Classic!","Kanye West drops another good album, that's for sure.But it's way overrated.Don't get me wrong, the album is a lot of fun but there are a lot of other albums that also dropped this year and are way better than ""Late Registration"".With his first album Kanye West already proved that he's creative when it comes to making beats and delivering fresh lyrics.and so does he shine on ""late registration"". especially ""crack music"", ""drive slow"" and ""gold digger"" are really dope tracks.these are the highlights of ""late registration"".so would i recommend this album? yes! but dont expect too much.its a enjoyable record not more not less.and to everybody that is interested in the samples used by kanye west i recommend.[...]"
2,Kanye let us down,i think that kanye's first album was way better (besides the two workout plans). the only good thing about this album was the sample and the callaborations. i really didn't enjoy it
2,"King of the ""Samples""","I wonder how far Kanye West would be if sampling music was a crime. This album has a few nice cuts but the album as a whole is pretty dull. The first album had some imagination behind it, this one does not. I'm sorry but I can't take listening to Kanye rapping on every single cut--with his first CD he had enough sense to let guest vocalist have some time to do what he really can't do, and that is actually sing. The lyrics are already getting old ( how many times do we have to hear about ""Jacobs"" jewelers ) and how many times is he rapping about himself (let some air out of that big head of yours).Overall a real disappointment."
5,A fantastic music CD,Kanye at his best with out a doubt. It is a great CD with collaborations from Jaime Foxx and Nas among others. Worth every penny.
5,Great album,I bought this CD yesterday and I absolutly LOVE it. I thought his first CD was great but this one might be even better.
1,Embarrasing,"This guy has to be one of the worst acts in music history. And his pathetic attitude does not help either, not to mention his inferiority complex. I can't believe this guy is winning Grammies for the crap he produces. I thought P Diddy was the end of music, I was wrong, this is even worse."
1,Worst CD since Bizzare's new album and Eamon's Album Last Spring,"Listen people.What are you thinking. This is the biggest flopp to date. Kanye made a bad mistake by his comments infront of the press. Now his CD is just as bad as his comments! His beats are weak at best, his lyrics have nothing to say, he is saying the same stuff that was said in his last album, GET OFF THE COLLEGE SUBJECT, ITS TIME TO GROW UP AND MOVE FORWARD, his hooks are sorry and non-existant. Kanye West is just another rapper. He does not have the ability to make everyone stop and think about what he is saying like groups/artists dating all the way back to the bettles, Elvis, Bob Marley, 2Pac, The Notorious BIG, Eminem and Kayne's mentor Jay-Z. If you love rap and music in general and are looking for a GREAT artist, then Kanye West is not for you. His Sophomore album is a flopp from his Freshmen album and I think he should not even have showed up for late registration and in fact stayed back a year as a freshmen."
4,Im feelin it,"Wit the exception of songs like gold digger , drive slow , and diamonds which were the singles of this album ? The rest is the album is tight. Good production and k. west's lirycs are truly sharp as an mc i must add. Idk why west chose to work with Paul wall ? he's super wack.Anyways i highly recommended its original as hell. Late registration is worth a purchase ."
4,Wild Card,"Kanye West proves one thing if nothing else: Not all rap is created equal. Like many other achievements in popular music, West takes elements from soul, jazz, and pop, to mix with his bright, witty lyrics. Fun but also formidable, Kanye takes on the trappings of American material culture and understandably finds much to mock. With different meters and measures, Kanye West makes all other efforts seem stale. Giving snatches of wit, his rapping inspires some real laughs. While inserting the soundtrack of a seductive siren voice singing ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" he tears off about the divide between American dreams and their (too often) unattainment. On 'Late Registration' the joker's wild--and often wise."
4,Fake reviews,"I like this CD, but isn't it interesting how many of these five-star reviews are written by people with only one review to their credit? Why does the record label force these peons to write fake reviews? ""Late Regisration"" is good enough to stand on its own. But don't take a fake reviewer's word for it."
2,Kayne west - late registration,"when kanye first hit the mainstream with ""thru the wire"", I knew he was going to be a success. hip-hop was in a state it had never been in before, when everything was so commercial it would make n*sync green with envy. needless to say, ""thru the wire"" and it's follow-up single, ""jesus walks"", were a huge step away from the normal hip-hop club bangers. However, ""the college dropout"" was you typical bait and switch hip-hop record, with two or three deep thinkers, and 14 ""club bangers"". Now, in 2005, kayne has followed up his successful debut with more of the same. Although some of the songs on this record are ""deep thinkers"", most go the way of commercial emcee, with tired lines about money, cars, women and ""ice"". I know kanye could write an album on a par with someone like nas, pac or Krs, but he won't, because money always comes first. Mainstream hip-hop is dead, and so goes with it all the talents that used to run the game. enjoy your nelly, people."
5,One word: WOW,"I just bought the cd and now i cant stop listening!All of the songs are just so well done...Diamonds From Sierra Leone (remix) is so amazing...i also really like ""Heard 'Em Say"", ""Touch The Sky"", ""Gold Digger"", in the end all of the songs...and the in between tracks are funny."
4,kanye late,"extremely exquisite work. shining gems-""Heard em say"", ""addiction"", ""We Major"", ""make it better"", and ""crack music. Jay-z remix of ""diamonds...."" is truly superior to original with improved verse by Kanye. Gil-scot Heron samples also a highlight. kanye's social commentary always appreciated. lupe fiasco, paul wall, and nas delight as guests on solid album."
4,pretty good,"the whole reason i bought this cd was because college dropout was so crazy. to me, unlike what everybody else says, this cd seems completely opposite his first and i dont think i was as good but it was still good. my fav songs was ones that were most close to songs on college dropout like bring me down and touch the sky"
3,Kayne West - late registration,"I enjoy the cd, but I got a burned version of the cd, not the original... Besides that everything went well"
5,The Greatest yet,This is the best CD I've heard since commons BE. This is one of those long anticipated albums that is sure not to let you down. Kanye west has a talent to sample the right songs to make a perfect song. Some of the skits are funny at times and all his songs have a true meaning. But seriously this is a review board not a political show. People are too focused on what he said on live tv. And too many people are trying to judge his action. It is also very hurtful to see that many people on this review column have the audacity to try to bring down black people. We are not the only ones in the Katrina affected area that have done wrong. But do not call us typical or racist. we just want justice and equality. Kanye West is a true Icon who deservers not to be pointed out for this. So leave him and us alone and stop hating. This is to all those who are not black with something smart to say about our people. PEACE!!!
1,Kanye hater here,"I ain't gonna lie and say I've heard the album and it sucks, but the first 2 single I have heard and they both suck. Therefore the album must suck. There are a lot of gullable white kids that will buy this album cause he dresses and acts like them. No real G will buy this album, guest appearances on most every song. Most every song has sampled someone else's music for the chorus. I can't stand Kanye's production or his lame raps. When does a producer think he can rap? Now. I know this will sell 2-3 mill but that just means there are 2-3 mill stupid people out there. The man called for an end to gay bashing by his fellow artists, who does he think he is telling them what to say or not say. Kanye is garbage and always will be. GGGGGGGGGGG-UNIT!!!!!"
1,garbage.,pure and simple. ohh and i love the way the lovers give bad reviews for other albums. heres one for you [...].
3,decent,"Kanye is good, I wont deny that...but he is good at producing NOT rapping. Drive Slow is a good track but people gotta realize that the beat of it is from ""Shorty wanna be a Thug"" by 2pac, 2pac would have never supported a track by Kanye or Paul Wall because they are fake. ""My Way Home"" is only good because of Common and ""Roses"" is the only track that is good without a featuring artist. ""Diamonds"" is only good when it has Jay-z's verse on it because Kanye is so lyrically unskilled on his own. People who listen to rap nowadays dont even remember 2pac or biggie... Rappers have to pay Homage to them (especially if you sample their track like Kanye). He is too cocky too early in his career. Listen to some real rap music. Tony Yayo sucks by the way."
5,LATE REGISTRATION,"this is a really good album. still a little torn between whether or not it is better than the fist. what im not indecisive about is whether or not it deserves 5 stars, which i definitely believe it does."
4,nice album but..,"has anybody noticed that he only raps for about a minute in most songs, and that the hook [singer] just vocals and the beat runs for like 40 seconds. i wish he put more lyrics, but still great album for what there is"
2,lyrics of pure disgust,"I have to say as a producer kanye has some nice skills...lyrics pure joke...his lyrics are some of the most simpilistica i have heard a mixture of will smith and nelly...and thats a bad combanation....i am one that listens to music for its content and the true art form not...FOR BAND WAGONS...and this is the case with this over rated,,,big headed kanye....OK I HAD TO REVIEW ...IF YOU LIKE HIS SINGLE I GUESS YOU WILL LIKE THIS ....TRUE HIP HOP HAS LOST ITS TRU FORM"
3,have to give it to him for trying,"kanye is one of the better rappers today in a music world that has gone downhill, especially in rap and hip hop and is a superb producer for other artists. I love how he used a lot of pianos on the music of this record and gave it a musical sound, but I'm not really feeling it. Aside from Diamonds and a couple other songs, there are no standout tracks like all falls down or jesus walks though it flows alright as an album. Still I think he's one of the better hip hop producers right now and I gotta give it to him for doin his thang"
3,its aiight,"i am in no way a hater but this album is just AIIGHT alot of the songs sound the same and his flow is still kind of suspect. That maroon 5 song he did is just LAME and the only tight song i'm really feelin is that Common joint but he always comes correct on his peers albums (ie. Black Star-Respiration, Pharoahe Monch-The Truth, etc.) And why cant he cant he create an original beat and if he is going to sample songs why not use the original the sample. If you want to hear an album that really knows how to use samples go get that pretty toney lp. Imagine what kanye would be w/o all those samples and all those guest artist......... WACK"
2,I don't get it. But then again I'm over 25.,"I find it very difficult to really get into Kanye's rapping style. I try, and try, and try. I fail to understand what the appeal is. I agree with many reviewers that the beats are great. However lyrically, Dr. Suess writes better rhymes. Incidentally, they both sell entertainment to the same demographic.Mr. West may not be much of a rapper, however, he appears to be a great businessman. It used to mean something when you protested a president or a war. Now the face of the anti-war counterculture drives Bentlys and drinks Moet. One thing is certain: He does a great job of selling albums. If you like music supplied to you by Clear Channel Communications Inc (tm) then this may be for you.Pass."
2,please...enough,"I just read this quote from this genius:""Now that I have a Grammy under my belt and [West's second album] Late Registration is finished, I am ready to launch my clothing line next spring.""-Kanye WestMeh, enough.I'll give him two stars for effort, other than that, just...""Meh.""Want a different sound in hip hop? I still recommend Jurassic 5 or Andre 3000's ""The Love Below"" or Outkast ""Stankonia"" over this anyday...and those are just current artists."
4,"Nothing real special about the lyrics, but the beats...","Kanye West is an impressive all-around artist, I'll say that. He's got the right balance of streetwise, backpack and pop-sap to win over enough of all those individual scenes and make an industry-wide impact.Is he a little preachy? Sure, sometimes. Can he get a little to emotionally sappy for me? Yup. But one thing you can't dispute is the serious musicality with which this album was constructed.From the Curtis-Mayfield-sampled 'Touch the Sky' to classy, stuttering clap of 'We Major,' each song has its own meticulously-crafted beat, with non-traditional hip-hop instrumentation all over the place. My personal favorite is 'My Way Home,' with its Gil-Scott Heron (I believe) sample and simple soul loop, with a nice guest verse from Common.West is so savvy he even sends a nod to the Dirty South with a syruped-out coda to 'Drive Slow.'Is it the Second Coming of Christ? No. But it's a damned good hip-hop album."
4,Niceee,Kanye dropped another hot one..this album was great and i dont know how you dont like this one..Diamonds was an instant classic and Golddigger helped compliment it along with a bunch of other great songs on this album...This was kanye's sophomore album and i think it was better than his first one.I definetly thing every should go get this one its on FIREE
3,"ITS OK,BUT I CANT REALLY GET INTO HIS STYLE OF MUSIC.","ITS NOT WACK IF YOUR A FAN OF KANYE,ALL I CAN SAY IS KEEP WORKING FAM."
4,Kanye..Mr. West to be exact...,"Great CD....could it be better??? Sure, but this man is hella' talented although he's attitude at times appears to be (((out-there....most talent folks were always appeared to be ((((out-there, at times. Well, he's made me a believer... so talented he is. My fav's..are many on here...it starts off sweet...mellow..a whatever at times but overall an uptempo, slick rhymes, catchy lyrics and a bunch in your step just makes me feel good in buying this record. Alright now Mr. West. ;)"
5,Kanye In His Prime,"It's been years since I purchased this album...and I still listen to it on the regular. Kanye ups his game for his sophomore album, and although not every track hits the mark, it is a very solid showing."
5,Amazing like always,I honestly love everything from Kanye because he always delivers. I haven't been disappointed from anyone of his CD's. It's more down to earth and less artsy then his newer stuff but I have to be honest that I like his older juvenile stuff better then the artsy stuff. The lyrics are better in the older stuff.
5,Kanye sounds best on Vinyl,I was surprised to find vinyl Kanye West Lps still for sale at a reasonable price on Amazon.com! Very good album for collectors
4,Kanye's Back,"Kanye West has gotten a lot of fame and hype this last year but with all that, I honestly thought his sophmore album would be a dud. I was wrong Kanye came back with better beats and lyrical content. This album is overall a great with many diffrent styles all mixed into one kind of like his fashion. Song's like ""Heard Em Say"" bring out his more pop culture side, while Songs like ""Drive Slow"" show his down South flavor as well. I feel Kanye has really made a transition on his sophmore album he's a more complete artist and his Cd shows this. My personal favorite song is ""Touch The Sky"" this song makes you feel good and also shows his Kanye's lyrical content to the fullest with punch lines so sick like ""I must of died in that accident because this must be Heaven"" He really took it up a notch on this album and he deserves the credit."
2,The Truth must be told.,"When this album first came out, I almost felt obligated to rant and rave about how good it was because of all the hype. There was, and still is, so much hype about it and to be completely honest, it's not what they say it to be.His debut album, College Dropout was excellent, and he deserved all of the acclaim for it, but this here is something different. This is so lackluster and boring. Seems like he gave his best beats away, because Late Registration's production is very lazy. Jon Brion might have done miracles for Fiona Apple, but Kanye, no.To all reading this, I'm not even trying to hate. I was a big Kanye fan, but this album is definitely his worst material and a sophmore slump. So as you see it on the ""Top Albums of 2005"" and the fact that it's two times platinum, just know that this, in my opinion, is not worth any of the hype. Get a better album, of his first one, as an alternative gift to Late Registration this season.-Nathaniel"
3,Not as solid as college dropout...,"Kanye is a mastermind, no doubt about it. I loved ""The College Dropout"" and he really did change the way the world looks at ""hip/hop or rap"". He is truly a different kind of artist. But this album is scattered...the song with Brandy is absolutely horrible....I liked the first album because it was FUN...the only songs fun to me on here are ""Gold Digga, Gone, Diamonds""...I LOVE those songs, the others I could take or leave. Regardless, Kanye is such an inspiration, I'm glad I bought it."
5,AWESOME,"not better than college droput, but still an awesome CD. track 19 with camron is like the best track and also the one called ""we major."" one of the best CDs otut there, i knew it would be thats why i BOUGHT IT...lol"
1,I THINK KANYE IS JUST A PHASE AND WILL PHASE OUT SOON,KANYE WEST MAKES SO MUCH MONEY WITH HIS ALBUMS WHY DOESNT HE DONATE HIS OWN MONEY FOR HURRICANE RELIEF AND STARVATION INSTEAD HE SPENDS IT ON JEWELRY WHEN THERES KIDS STARVING AROUND THE WORLD. ROC A FELLA SUCKS AND NAS SHOULDVE NEVER GAVE HIM THE PLEASURE OF BEING IN HIS ALBUM. KANYE IS A NAS WANNA BE.
1,Boring Dull Lifeless Music,"all rap and hiphop and r&b is so boring. how could anyone listen to this crap. go head. add this piece of what you call music to your collection. WASTE YOUR MONEY! or maybe not....maybe spending your money wisley on music that is actually MUSIC! like say ummmmm.....metallica, godsmack, pantera, evanescence, hatebreed, nirvana, linkin park,..........catch my drift. RAP, R&B, HIP HOP SUCKS!!!!!!!!! ROCK/METAL RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Get Yer Not Helpful Button Finger Ready,"The much aclaimed Jon Brion production just makes everything sound kinda like movie music. He shoulda got the dude from the High Llamas to do the strings. If he had I coulda bronzed the rest of my CD collection and hung it on the mantle, because this is all I would have wanted to listen to. As is, its the most boring ""all time classic"" since U2."
1,Wish he would dropout of existence,"Man, the only good thing this guy ever did was the beat for Talib Kweli's Just To Get By.I am so sick of what hip hop has become. I'm so sick of rich rappers constantly talking about ""street cred"" and ""representin' ma peoples"" when they are in fact wealthy business entrepeneurs who own clothing lines and massive mansions. I'm tired of the culture and the media that glorifies them. I'm tired of useless worthless rappers who come out and own the world's attention for 15 minutes before fading from view altogether only to be replaced by the next flavor of the month. Hip hop, like punk rock, used to be an urban art form, a music that was the voice of disaffected street youth. Since then, it has become anything but.""President Bush doesn't care about black people!"". I have a newsflash for you Kanye: BUSH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE!I'm sure you and Spike Lee could probably care less about the white people who were affected by the Katrina tragedy anyways."
1,Awful quality,"After purchasing this product, I was excited to listen to it on my record player (Pro-Ject Debut III). After dropping the needle, I was utterly disappointed in the sound quality. The record, to my ears, was un-listenable. I tried the B side of the record to see if maybe something had happened during the pressing of the A side, but the sound was just as bad. I returned the album (first return ever), utterly disappointed.TL;DR: Don't get this album. Get My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy instead, the music and packaging are a thousand times better."
1,I Knew it,This is a truly weak and dissapointing effort. I beleive Kanye is very overrated..I mean the guy can NOT FLOW!!...He simply can not rap. Why people seem to think this is briiliant is a mystery.
5,Kanye West = Genious,"In a year that was dominated by crunk, 50 Cent and other not so notable types of music and artists, I feel this is really the greatest release of the year. Actually the greatest release of the year and years to come. I really haven't heard an album as of late that has blown my mind until now. Great flows, lyrics, music and big ups to producer Jon Brion for creating new ground for rap music and breaking the boundaries and stereotypes. From start to finish, this album is very strong so I highly suggest and recommend picking up this cd. If you are disappointed it's probably because you are deaf."
5,Brilliant Sophmore Album for Kanye!,This album is absolutely brilliant work by the great Kanye West.Crack Music is an amazing sequel to Jesus Walks. Roses is a brilliant song about America's health care and Addiction is a masterpiece about the things that tempt all of us. This is one of my favorite albums of all time without a doubt.Tracks:Heard Em Say- 9/10Touch the Sky- 9/10Gold Digger- 10/10Crack Music- 10/10Roses- 10/10Bring Me Down- 10/10Addiction- 10/10Hey Mama- 10/10Celebration- 7/10We Major- 8/10Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)- 10/10My Way Home- 9/10Diamonds from Sierra Leone- 9/10Absolutely amazing!Make sure you listen to Addiction and Crack Music as soon as you buy it!
2,Don't waste your breath,"One thing's for sure: Kanye West has a big ego. Isn't anybody else bothered by this? Case in point is the song ""Diamonds from Sierra Leone."" Sure the beat is terrific and I love that sample that serves as the song's refrain, but the lyrics really get to me. A song titled ""Diamonds from Sierra Leone"" seems like the perfect way to make some good social commentary on the human injustices that are the result of the diamond trade in the African country of Sierre Leone, but West seems too concerned with rapping about how rich he is, how big his hits are, how wrong critics were about his music, to bother with all that stuff. The only thing I learned from this song is that he's got a Porshe, was nominated for some Grammies, is better than everyone else, etc. Bravo, Kanye, in one song you've managed to demonstrate just how far hip-hop has strayed from its roots of social commentary to end up at its current state of complete narcissism and irrelevence."
5,"support this dude, he's the real thing","The music is the best I've heard in years from a hip hop artist, kanye is the man! KANYE FOR PRESIDENT!!!"
4,"Solid. Very solid. However, could've done well without the skits 2-4.","I love this album. It's real. Real Kanye.Some of the material is a tad darker than what was touched on in The College Dropout (2004)The College Dropout:Bring Me Down (Haters) Roses (Grandma with AIDS) and Heard 'Em Say (Racism).A lot of these tracks are very, VERY fun and catchy also:Heard 'Em Say, Gold Digger, Drive Slow, Celebration and We Major.Kanye's songwriting skills improved a bit too. I think this is the pinnacle of his oh-so-short career (thus far, anyway). I guess the beats on his new album, Graduation (2007)Graduationare better overall, but it's not as solid, and lacks the depth that is showed here.Love the Hell out cha, Kanye ""Omari"" West! :P And so what his head is a bit bigger than others; Surely, it'd happen to half of us if we were in the shady business that he's in.A decent ""Pop"" Rap album. 4 stars.end note: (9/15/08) Favorite tracks are Bring Me Down, Roses, Drive Slow, Heard Em Say and We Major."
1,Worst album ever,"I think Kanye West is the most overated MC...his production skills are str8 garbage and he's the worst lyricist ever. Even the Bravehearts album is better. Save your money and don't buy this weak a** album. This LP is a waste of time to listen end a waste of money. I threw it through my window after a couple of minutes. Kanye do not deserves to be on the cover of Time...it's a shame. No style, no skills...this is totally wack !!! Buy Boyz N da hood instead, this is a true classic."
2,Horrible,"He's suppose to be the savior of hip hop??? This album was HORRIBLE! This album was not up 2 par at all. Yo if you wanna hear a good album, go pick up that Young Jezzy- Lets Get It: Thug Motivation 101!"
1,worst production i eva heard,kanye west is the absolute worst rapper and producer ever........man chingy skeets on this guy 5-times and still has enough juice to skeet on Tupac.....the worst ever
4,"crazy guy, but really cool too",gotta love kanye. I'm into r&b and not hip hop but this CD is a jewel in the crown. Don't let the cheesy videos with weird production prevent you from checking out this CD.
3,like a collection of singles,"I dig Kanye, but Late Registration seemed a little off to me. There were just too many guest appearances to maintain a flow in my opinion. Jigga here, Brandi there, Paul Wall, Cam'ron (ugh). It seemed more like a collection of singles to me. The production, of course, was tight, and Kanye's thoughtfullness is apparent throughout. It seems like this is what you get from a big label, big budget release nowadays. Remember when Eric B and Rakim and other groups held down entire albums by themselves?"
1,I'm not saying alot,"This album sucks first of all golddigger got played out,i neverliked it.Then Kanye says Bush don't like Black People,what about whites,He don't like them ether.Then the beats are wack,Kayneneeds to keeps some of theese beats for himself.P.S. The Kid's review who said Kayne's better than 2pac nas ,man Kayne has no chance with pac or nas,especially nas he already took down one roc artist.do the knowledge idiot."
2,should have downloaded it.,"Although Kanye's sound is unique, it fell well below expectations. I feel the best tracks are represented by radio airplay, and the rest are just, ok. Die hard fans will probably really enjoy this work, but as neither a lover nor hater of Kanye, i can say without bias that its not all that its hyped out to be. Beware, listen before you buy it."
1,This is music?,"What is with all the hype regarding Kanye West? Is it because he behaves outrageously to get attention for his CD? This CD stinks. In my personal humble opinion, when an artist has to have guest artists on almost all of his songs, it just shows his insecurity in his own talent to carry the song by himself. This is an overhyped, rediculous CD and I hated it!!! And by the way Kanye, by changing one word for your ""Mama"" song doesn't make it orignal. And you portrayel of Christ on Rolling Stone is the most outrageous and offensive act you have committed to date and for this may God forgive you poor soul."
4,WAC REGISTRATION,THIS ALBUM IS BAR NONE THE WORST EVERNO GOD DAMN CATFCHY SONG AT ALL2 WWORDS ~~~~~~~~~ DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,kanye does not wite his own rhymes!........look in the panflet,kanye west did not write his own lyrics. He didnt even write hey mama! look in the panflet if u dont believe me! it says written by at the end of each song. kanye only wrote 2 songs which sere celabration and driive slow.
1,OVERRATED,"Does anyone else see that Kanye West is very overrated?I gave this cd a chance. My co-workers listened to it about twelve times today, and think that it is the best cd they have ever heard before. He is really not THAT sweet. Gold Digger is a decent song, but will be played out soon. The rest of the album is bland, while being somewhat creative but uneven... it left me very unfulfilled.There are many better rap cds, mostly released in 1996-2001, but this cd is strictly average. I am sick of seeing Kanye on tv, magazine covers, etc. because he is OVERRATED. It's not like he sucks, but he is no Pac, BIG, Jay-Z, Eminem, etc."
1,Sux!,"1. Racist, sexist lyrics2. No artistic merit3. Commercial garbage4. Waste of moneyHow can you be ghetto and rap about how hard life is when you're raking in millions. Fake ass muthaf'er.Kanye West is one of the 5% wealthiest people in America and he's gonna tell me about how the man is keepin him down?He is ""The Man"" using his accountants to use tax loopholes so that working people pay most of the taxes.Even though this is his 2nd album, he's a 1 hit wonder and will be forgotten after Golddigger has been played out.See ya!"
1,"Better then the first, but, not too much","I have yet to figure out why people think Kanye is so inventive & original, when he sounds like everything that's been on so called ""hip hop"" radio for the past 6 or so years. Fortunatly, there are a few cuts on here that are tight, & I emphasize ""few"". Deffinitly listen to it before you buy, it's one of those BEYOND overated albums. If you want some real hip hop, & not just this commercial garbage, go check out someone from Project Blowed or even Fort Minor, which really surprised me. It's real hip hop, coming from a guy, who some would diss for being in a rock/rap hybrid group. Keep in mind, I'm not here to back Kanye, I'm just pointing out what I hear. I listen to ALOT of hip hop, & I also flip by the radio from time to time, & this album, for the most part, just sounds like your average commercial rap album, maybe with less bling."
2,Still Puffy/Diddy Lite,"Kanye West aka Kon Man Least doesn't do much for me musically. dude can't Rap,same ole Sped up trick with Sampling,Looping&speeding up vocals that was cool back in 1985. I give Him Hustle Points,but as a Artist He is Vastly Overrated&I gotta believe He spent some of His Album Budget at buying off Magazines,Radio,etc... because the Cuts on here are just basically Poor Rehases of His Debut Album. I can tolerate His contradictions as a Writer,but certain things are repeated to the point that it just gets so boring. if His Music was matched His Ego then I could see Him getting some of the Hype He gets.but getting the cover of ""Time"" Magazine behind another Average album is a Bit much.He basically reminds me of a Poor Man's Puffy/Diddy with a bit more Musicality."
1,NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY,"Kanye West should be compared to the hair/metal bands of the 80's, all flare and no delivery, a badly dressed corporate tool and people like him because the music scene isn't producing anything better right now. This guy is a joke in every aspect of the word and his fans will be to embarrassed to admit ever listening to him a few years from now."
2,Is this really considered hip hop?,"To start off I am not a fan of Kanye: he is not a good enough lyricist, dont like his voice, his delivery style gets old and annoying. He is a pretty cocky and confident person, but his music doesnt show it; he sounds like a pansy to me. But if you like the softer sounding rappers, then Kanye is for you. He does have a couple of songs that actually made my head bob and got me singing along, but they are only the songs that are already out for singles.The songs sound awesome, different moods; but they arent hip hop moods. It is more like pop than anything else.Not a BAD album, very different. but not worth the $$"
3,kanye west another 3 out of 5.,"You may remeber last year I gave kanye west 3 out of 5 with first album.hits like gold digger, Diamonds from sierra leone, and drive slow.his album gets another 3 out of 5."
1,We hate this bigot,Blue Racer: This guy claims to love everyone yet he hates white people. Japanese Beetle: Kanye was not nice to degrade white race so I will attack him as I am black belt in karate. Blue Racer: What do people don't get that Diamonds from Sierra Leone is an attack on white people. Japanese Beetle: Golddigger was terrible with that awful Ray Charles imitation and I deserve to give him a karate chop. Avoid! Sayonara!
3,late registration,"Another Kanye West album,another failed attempt to sound like RZA!While kanye's talent as a producer is unquestionable his originality most certainly is.This is a pretty good record.Most of the tracks are fire.Definately worth buying.Kanye's lyrics much like on his last album are somewhat weak though clever at times.Kanye must realize that he is not and will never be part of WU-TANG!!!! I know kanye was heavily influenced by rza's music but with a more creative approach to his beats he could be near or on rza's level.So stop biting rza,and get your own style!!!"
2,Give me a break!,"I loved College Dropout so much. I wore that CD out like nobody's business. Even though my interest in Kanye waned as his tremendous ego took over his personality, I was still eagerly anticipating the release of Late Registration. Knowing the extent of Kanye's potential, I figured he would get me to like him again. I was wrong.This insipid garbage is barely listenable. The tracks are super overproduced, this from someone who claimed to mix down Diamonds from Sierra Leone 17 times. The production overpowers the basic, boring, bland lyrics, which might just be a good thing. His arrogance is clear as he extrapolates the beat forever after the verses are complete. The only standout song on there is ""Hey Mama,"" which is certainly not appropriate for everyday listen.I gave the ambitious man two stars for the production and lyrics that were actually passable, but I could never think of giving him more. He certainly didn't give me more."
3,What went wrong?,"I bought this CD thinking it provide the same enjoyable and innovative music ""The College Dropout"" did. While I wasn't entirely disappointed, I don't agree with the critic's opinions that this CD is better than his first. This one feels as if Kanye was trying too hard to get his message across. Many of his songs sound heavy and preachy, not like the uplifting and fun songs of his first album.I loved ""Slow Jamz"" and ""The New Workout Plan"", two of the singles from his first album. ""Gold Digger"" is the album's first single, but I can already tell it's a song that gets more annoying as you listen to it. Listening to some of the CD's other tracks, I can't figure out which one will be another sucessful single. Some of the songs I haven't been able to listen to all the way. The only songs on the album I'm willing to listen to more than once are ""Hears 'Em Say,"" ""Touch the Sky,"" ""Late,"" and ""Diamonds From Sierra Leone."""
1,Dissapointing Sophomore Effort,I knew Kanye west would flop. The fact that he didnt made the top 200 album charts only speaks to the album overall quality. A truly WEAK and Dissapointing effort.
4,A new fan,"I use to hate Kanye West. I couldn't stand the guy. Whenever a Kanye song would come on the radio...I'd just turn the station. But after going on a 2 hour road trip with a friend of mine, who happens to be a HUGE Kanye fan, I was forced to listen to the entire album..from start to finish. After actually giving it a chance, I'm really impressed. Each track has its own individual sound. His music is unlike anything I've ever heard. The upbeat songs will have you on your feet and the slower ones are good to just chill and relax to after a hard day. The lyrical content is amazing. Kanye has a lot to say...and he has no problem expressing himself. Even the little skits are pretty hilarious !! Don't knock this album until you listen to it from beginning to end. It's worth every penny."
3,Maybe the Only Voice,"That begs to differ. A classic this is not! College Dropout was much better. There are some standouts and Kanye should be commended for having vision in a genre(RAP, not hip-hop) that has been dying a slow miserable death commercially since the 90's. However, this is not great work and I do believe that Kanye probably feels the same but being the self-coined ""arrogant a-hole"" that he is, will allow his ego to boost this lack luster project. Disappointed to say the least. Overall not worth the money I paid for it!"
4,Not quite as good as College Dropout,"To OzzyApu just because Kanye has knowledge of self by saying that AIDS was created by Caucasians to kill Blacks and Latins doesn't make him a racist. My people still face racism today and that will never change. You must be Caucasian and if so you don't and you wouldn't understand Kanye's as well as other minorities beliefs about what we deal with in Amerikkka. Caucasians lie to us daily. For example, the picture of the so-called Jesus Christ that appears to be a Caucasian man but not of African descent? Enough of the His-story lesson, Kanye's latest album was descent. He took some chances with this one but a couple songs like ""Ride Slow"" and ""Celebration"" could of been left of the album. I still would recommend this cd to anyone who loves music."
3,"Amazing album, terrible vinyl",I'm sure we all know how good this album is. It's therefore a shame that the vinyl release of this album is terrible. Everything is all distorted.Stop putting digital music on vinyl. Christ.
2,The truth must be told.,"When this album first came out, I almost felt obligated to rant and rave about how good it was because of all the hype. There was, and still is, so much hype about it and to be completely honest, it's not what they say it to be.His debut album, College Dropout was excellent, and he deserved all of the acclaim for it, but this here is something different. This is so lackluster and boring. Seems like he gave his best beats away, because Late Registration's production is very lazy. Jon Brion might have done miracles for Fiona Apple, but Kanye, no.To all reading this, I'm not even trying to hate. I was a big Kanye fan, but this album is definitely his worst material and a sophmore slump. So as you see it on the ""Top Albums of 2005"" and the fact that it's two times platinum, just know that this, in my opinion, is not worth any of the hype. Get a better album, of his first one, as an alternative gift to Late Registration this season.-Nathaniel"
4,Late Registration,"I really like this CD...usually i only like one or two more well known songs on a rap CD, although I found that i liked just about all of the songs on Kanyes CD"
3,NOT GREAT JUST GOOD,"Kanye's last cd really was very good, this new cd is very good too but not award winning i'm sure, i only liked 4 songs of the whole cd.. Dimonds are forever is a great song, so is gold digger and others but they have played them in the radio so much that i'm so tired of listening to them. But it's a good cd. i love kanye great producer and singer"
1,not what i thought it was,i thought it would show youin demonstration how to do the moves but now its flat you see from one view thats far away cant see where he puts his hands on the pressure points
3,Beware the Kindle addition,It was hard to rate this book because there really are two reviews here.The book itself is good. I would definitely recommend it especially for a beginning brewer.The Kindle addition is TERRIBLE! It seemed as if it was scanned and not edited as there are many misspelled and wrong words. That is mildly annoying. The biggest problem is that this book uses many tables that are unreadable on the Kindle. These tables are important lists and references.The bottom line is buy this in book form but stay clear of the Kindle format. Can I get my money back so I can buy the actual book?
5,Easy to read and to understand,"I'm new in brew beer, and this book help a lot to understand each part of the process. It give you all the details,"
5,Best book to start with and grow with!,"The reason why I bought this book is because it answered all my questions when I first started brewing. Now that I am becoming more experienced it still has a lot to offer. Honestly best book on home brewing I have read. It is easy to understand, have pictures, and has information for both beginner and experienced."
5,Great book for beginner and intermediate,"I bought this book after I brewed my first batch from a kit. I read the pamphlet that came along with the kit and went into basics of brewing and did some reading on the internet. First batch turned out, but after this I realize just how many little things I could have done better. This book is a good introduction for the beginning brewer or would be a good review for intermediates as well. It is a quick read, took me about a week of reading an hour or two at night.It starts out with how to brew your first batch correctly, then builds in layers of complexity until by the end, you understand the basics of how to brew a batch with grain and why we do the things we do. Overall excellent book and I would recommend to anyone getting into brewing."
5,How to Brew,"If you're interested in home brewing, buy this book! John Palmer does an excellent job explaining how to brew all kinds of beers from extracts to all grain beers with everything you need to know. He also has many recipes in the book for beers. There is only one book you need for brewing and this is it."
4,Good book for starters,"Good book for starters, great but sometimes long on details. I would recommend getting this book before brewing your first batch."
5,Well Written,"I have made two batches since I bought this book, and they have both come out excellent. I have the ""homebrew bible"" and while it is a good book, How to Brew just explained things in a way that made me relax about the beer I was brewing. It explains in a more consice way when TO worry about sanitation, and when NOT TO. Overall this is an excellent purchase!"
5,"The best, most comprehensive, thorough book on brewing you can find...","I originally read the first edition of this book on his website for free. If you can't lay hands on this book, it's well worth it to get what information you can from this book at www.howtobrew.com.However, if you're a budding zymurgist, or even if you've been brewing for a couple years, this book is well worth the piddly amount they're charging for it. It's saved my butt a couple of times when I've discovered I was low on a certain type of grain or on priming sugar.Papazian is good, and there are several other books that are good to augment your library, but if you're going to get one book, I highly recommend this one.Easy to read, informative....it'll help you brew some seriously tasty brews."
4,What you nned to know,"The book is straight forward and interesting. It makes the process easy to follow. It has been sometime since my last batch of beer. I could not find my other book, so I bought this one. Very happy with the purchase."
4,Delivered in timely manner.,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. Look like it was very informative and a very good book for someone who wants to learn the process of brewing beer.
5,Everything you wanted to know about brewing,"Author is very detailed and thorough in explaining ALL of the aspects of home brewing. I brewed my first batch using the recipe he gave in the first chapter and it turned out excellent!Favorite features:- Down and dirty crash course in first chapter for those that want to dive right in.- Lists EVERYTHING you will possibly need to get and need to know to get started...and then some.- Gets deep into the science of brewing so the reader understands how this all works- Witty, makes it an easy readOne minor complaint. I thought that the chapters were a little out of order. I found myself wishing that chapters 7,9, and 11 followed chapter 1 as they are important chapters for the ""how to"" part."
5,Great book,I love this book! Very helpful and easy to understand. I bought this book a few years ago and loan des to a friend. I bought it again for him on Christmas so that I could get mine back with my notes in it. Now that I have been brewing for a few years I use it as more of a reference.
5,Great book if you want to brew great beer,"When I started brewing, this was the book that gave me the knowledge to not fail. As I've developed as a brewer, the book has stayed with me, informing me at each step. I know I would be a much less skilled and more disappointed brewer without it."
5,"Wow, just wow.","I've read the excerpts from the how to brew website inside and out. I decided to finally buy this third edition book.Points to the publisher for putting so many pages on the ""look inside"" preview.This is a book you can grow with. You can start with the base guidelines for a beginner brewer, and grow into all-grain and as complex as you care. It's more than a step by step, it's loaded with tons of information about every step in the process.Definitely a must have for the home brewer library."
5,Essential Reading for Aspiring Homebrewers,Essential reading if you're looking to get into homebrewing. Everything you need to know and a lot of cools stuff you don't 'need' to know but will find incredibly cool and interesting.
3,The Kindle Edition,"My review is more for the kindle edition as I have only read about 30% of the book so far and I find the information good and laid out nicely.Palmer writes it in good order.It is helping me a lot to understand different things about brewing beer.I do not like this on the Kindle and wish I would have bought the paperback instead.When Palmer say's for more info go to such and such a place it would of been easier with a real book.I imagine that their might be a way to do it on the kindle and go back to where you left off but,I do not want to do all the investigating on how to do it with the kindle.I would rather spend that time reading the book.If I find this book marked down somewhere I will snap it up.If not I might just buy the hard copy anyway."
4,Home brewing,This book goes very in depth on several methods/formulas etc on home brewing. There are several recipes styles included. This book is recommended by home brewing suppliers. The Amazon price is about half of the printed price on the back cover.
5,Intoxicating,"Great book, good price, fast professional service. Getting ready to make some brew. How dry I am."
4,Great Reference for Home Brewers but needs to be updated,"This is my go-to book for home brewing. However, the pictures and some of the content needs to be updated as the pictures are pretty old looking and the overall feel of the book just feels dated. An updated edition would make this book 5 stars all the way."
4,Excellent book about brewing.,This book is a good introduction to home brewing and I look forward to try some of the beer recipes in it.
5,Great Book,"I started to brew with this book and the experience has been awesome, everything is very well explained and the book gives a lot of tips to et the best possible beer. I think is the best book to start brewing."
5,Great for beginning brewers,"I read this book before I started brewing my own beer and this book helped guide me through the labyrinth of chemistry and equipment needed. This book does contain its own quirkiness of procedures to follow(very ""diligent""), which I have adapted into my own process. This book has all the info you need to start brewing plus some."
1,Worthless,"Knife bent back completely at pivot point. Edge was so dull that it couldn't cut through an apple w/o stabbing the tip in first. Light flickers when on, has poor battery connection. Sometimes turns off without warning."
2,Not much meat. Buy the book.,"This info could have been condensed into two cassettes, but it would be difficult to charge $... for only two tapes. Save your money and buy Korsgaden's, ""Power Position Your Agency"". Same info with more detail and a lot less expensive."
5,The Best Communication Audio,"I love learning interpersonal skills. Lund does a masterful job of relating important communication skills for our daily lives. I highly recommend it to everyone. It help you identify yourself, and teaches important principles of communication in a humorous way. It is as good as listening to Brian Regan!"
4,Very readable by your own self.,"Maybe this is one of the most famous books in classical econometrics now at graduate level. Different from other overwhelming econometrics text books (e.g., Greene), this textbook is very readable and still practical. I liked it."
1,Another badly written statistics book,"For professors who have seen this material over and over again, it might be reliable.But for students wishing to learn the material this book is garbage. The author doesn't bother to explain anything, and the examples given are few in number and extremely narrow in focus. Exercise problems have little or no relevance to the chapters they belong to, and often other books or sources are required just to decipher the meaning of the questions or to borrow intuition from to solve them. Prose is extremely terse, ineffective, and incomplete. It seems as though the author just didn't care enough to make the book readable or usable. Goldberg makes the reader have to work excessively hard to gain any kind of interesting or important information. This book appears to just be another example of a badly written book in an entire field of badly written material."
4,"Pick this up, WotC has never had a better series","This book was flat out excellent. It lost a star for having some pointlessness toward the middle, but the ending and characters can make up for everything. The actual storyline uses the campaign steeting that far exceeded the actual game's quality for a base. The Dark Matter setting is one of strict paranoia and rampant paranormal activity, and this lives up to the standard. Plus, this is the precursor to one of the most entertaining books I've ever read, If Whispers Call. Think a less overly mysterious X-files mixed with NYPD Blue. Quality."
3,"Not a 2"" punch","The actual size of the punched piece of paper is is 1 3/4"", not 2"". Might be a small deal, but when you need to write on piece of paper, the extra 1/4"" is pretty important."
3,Smaller than what I was expecting,This hole punch works great - I just was expecting something larger so people could write a message on the leaf.
1,Chronicle,Chronicle is right. Even for a historical it was overly analytical. Dated and full of useless information about a very important time in french/world history.
2,Unless you're a Harvard History graduate don't bother.,"This highly regarded book has to be the biggest let down I've read in 10 years. The prose is mind numbingly dull and over intricate and you're left with the feeling that Schama wrote it to impress his Columbia University collegues with his oh-so brilliant depth of knowledge. The books biggest fault is Schama's unwillingness to dare to condescend and explain anything, he just takes for granted that you understand the doctrines of Voltaire and Rousseau and other notable people and institutions, and has the annoying habbit of breaking into French phrase without giving any translation. This book with its intricacies could be quite usefull to someone with an already deep knowledge of the subject, albeit being a revisionist piece, but to the person with a casual interest its just a big fat, expensive waste of paper.JD"
2,Slip sliding away,"The book got less readable as it went along, hence the ""slip sliding away"" title. I guess if you like detailed accounts of the goings-on at conventions, and assemblies this is the book for you. I found it tedious and boring once the revolution got started. The author loves French phrases with no definition given. I thought his style was pretentious and fussy. So, not a very good book."
5,a masterpiece of research,"Even though I am well versed in both American and European history, my knowledge of the French Revolution was rather limited. Mr. Schama filled in all those gaps and then some. It is facinating to read how the revolution got more and more radical as time went on, until it got to the point where each group systematically destroyed each successive group and its individuals. What started as a noble goal degenegated into class hatred and retribution. Political correctness truly was the order of the day, and it took only one wrong word to literally lose your head! The contrast among the English, American and French revolutions is also interesting. The stability of the former two compared to the chaos of the latter. I was disappointed the book didn't continue until the Napoleonic coup of 1799. A glossary of the French terms would have helped."
4,Be Open-minded (And Bring Your Thesaurus),"First off, Simon Schama has a much broader vocabulary than most of us, so bring your thesaurus or dictionary when sitting down.My goal when picking up ""Citizens"" was to learn more about the French Revolution, something I had never studied in any depth. This book does have depth and beyond just reciting facts and figures, analyzes the men and women of the Revolution, and provides a view point on the events, often contradicting or expanding previous research and publications. I got a hell of a lot more out of ""Citizens"" than I ever expected. I now have a context of French Revolution not only within French History but how it compares to the American Revolution, English revolutionary struggles, and its influence on Bonaparte, the Soviets, and Europe as a whole.Sit down, bring your dictionary (and plenty of time - it took me over 10 years to pick it up and another year to read it!) and enjoy ""Citizens""."
4,Very good history book,"Very detailed history of the French Revolution, with a detailed examination of the myriad factors that caused it. Engaging and well written.My only criticisms would be that the huge number of names thrown at you can be a bit overwhelming - you're never sure whether a new name that is being introduced is one that you should take note of as it might pop up repeatedly, or whether it will just disappear as fast as it was mentioned."
4,A revisionist history of the French Revolution,"For many years the Jacobin-Marxist school of interpretation has held sway in looking at the French Revolution. Historians such as Albert Soboul have dominated thinking about the events of 1787 to 1795. Schama takes careful aim at these historians with a massive work, that looks at the chaotic underpinnings of the French Revolution.Schama is a great writer and recreates the swirl of detail of the period. Nonethless, historians such as Soboul need to be read as well. Schama can get a little lost in the detail and the great contribution of Soboul has been to look at the underlying social changes that affected French Society during that period.It would be a grave mistake to believe that Schama was in any sense definitive, but he has shattered the Jacobin-Marxist school's ownership of the French Revolution. Each reader will have to decide which about truth of each interpretation."
4,Good Satir Basics,This easy to read book is a great introduction to the works of Virginia Satir. It is full of information that is useful to both Therapists and general readers. The illustrations by the author make the book fun to read and easy to understand. Readers who enjoy this book will probably want more depth that can be found in other books by Satir.
3,Not what I expected,"I totally agree with the reader from Reading, MA. I bought this hoping it would have more updated information than the latest edition of Baby Bargains (which I ended up purchasing anyway.) Baby Bargains is a must-have guide for new parents. I take it with me to every baby store."
3,The downfall of Saddam Hussein.,"A nice little picture book about the War in Iraq. This book only explores the 2003 War that brought Saddam down. It does not cover the insurgentcy after the collaspe of Saddam's government. It covers the 21 days to bring Saddam down. As always, Time's pictures are without equal. There is not much meat in this book about the conflicts raging in both Iraq and the United States about starting the war.If one wants to flip through the pages to learn about the 21 day campaign, this is an OK book. If one wants to find more about this conflict, you need to read elsewhere."
5,Contains high quality pictures and detailed information,This is worth it for the price if you want to follow the events of the conflict. Many photos depicting the real events that happened on our Tv screens while it all happened. I enjoyed the book and keep it on my coffee table.
3,"""The Inside Story of How America Won the War Against Iraq""","I have a copy of this and the photos and the story are great. The only difference is the cover.Mine has the caption ""The Inside Story of How America Won the War Against Iraq"".The top has the banner ""WAR COMMEMORATIVE EDITION"".I don't see the different versions noted in the main bin or the used copy bins."
4,LOTR nerd,"This is very good if you want to go more in depth about the LOTR fans and the world of LOTR. It's great and fun and funny, the interviews are great and it shows how dedicated-or crazy-LOTR fans are. It goes into the world of J.R.R and it shows the popularity of the movies and the fans that are willing to do anything and go anywhere to show thier love."
2,More about the book then the fans,I had such high hopes for this film. Beware anyone telling you it is about the recent fandom because very little in this film is about fans. Too much of it is interviews with the actors talking about how they feel about the books and how it inspires them and blah blah blah. It is also a history of Tolkein and his book starting from 1954. That part is ok but overblown and boring. I was going into this thinking it would be more along the like of Trekkies or Star Wait. I am not a trek fan nor a huge star wars fan but those two movies were so far above this one it's embarassing. From the title you expect this to be about the fans. Again...beware...there is very little about the actual fans or even about the movie. Huge disappointment
1,ZERO STARS!!!,"I had very high hopes for this movie, but I had to stop watching it at about the thirty-minute mark because I couldn't take one more second of the pseudo-psychedelic graphics, shots of fake hippies smoking pot and reading ""the book"", cheesey animation, self-serving interviews, and total lack of focus in the narration - not to mention the documentary itself.The extended version of (I believe) ""Fellowship of the Ring"" has a documentary among the 'special features' that does perfectly what this film purports to do - tell the story of the LOTR phenomenon.Watch that instead of this sorry cinematic endeavor."
2,"Not about the books, but rather Hippie culture","Ringers has some good moments, but on the whole it's probably not going to interest most LOTR fans. I love the books and the movies, but Ringers is mostly about pop culture, not the books and movies themselves. It talks about hippies, heavy metal songs, spoofs, and roadside attractions - but not the books or movies! I'd be interested in learning about the book's impact on U.S. politics and culture, but much of the documentary simply features stock footage of hippies dancing. Some parts are just dumb, like the homosexual fan fiction). It does have a few interesting interviews about the 1970s cartoon versions, but frankly it spends way too much time on these failed films. Overall, I was relieved when it was over."
3,"Not so much about the actual fans, more about the history of the books.","This was a good film if you are expecting to learn mainly about the history of The Lord of The Rings, and not learn very much about the fans. I was expecting something more along the lines of ""Trekkies"" since this documentary is called ""Ringers: Lord of the Fans"" afterall."
3,Ringers - Lord of the Fans,A must for the quasi serious collector. Fun to see how Lord of the Rings has impacted popular culture.
3,it's ok,i've read a lot of the blueford books and a lot of them are exiting but in the bigging of this book i got kinda bored. it was like that until the biginning of the middle.then it got exiting again.
4,Just A matter of trust- Kaylee Johnson 5 eng.,"In the book just a matter of trust is about a girl that, got to a high school and has a great boy friend but has not so normal home life. Her dad walked out on her and her mother and little sister(really sad), now she cant tack him back but her sister is having no problem doing that. Her boy friend is extreamly talented but is to scared to go up on the stage or for that matter he is not even able to up to the front of the class and he studers alot. But she finnaly lets her dad back in her life, after have a nice dinner with him and a really nice place. but in the end it is so good well i guess that it would probley be a bad thing for me to tell you what happens in the end of the book. So you better get sdtarted reading that book."
3,AR Project,"In A Matter of Trust there is very interesting plot. It starts off with Brisana Meeks and Roylin Bailey are making fun of Hakeem Randall who is the main character Darcy Wills's boyfriend. Then Brisana starts to like ""hangout"" with Hakeem. Darcy is very mad at Brisana. Brisana and Darcy used to be really good friends with each other until Darcy started to be friends with ""the zeros"" Tarah and Cooper. Tarah was having her birthday party at a public park and Roylin Bailey uninvited comes up and picks a fight with Hakeem and Roylin gets punched and is running away when a driveby shooting comes and shoots tons of bullets and only one hit someone, Roylin Bailey right in the head. From that point on, Brisana and Darcy were better friends again. This story took place mainly at Bluford high school. The major conflict wad the one between Brisana and Darcy and after the shooting they resolved their conflict."
3,Iffy,"Not sure I am completely sold on this book, many of the stories have strange endings or at the very least really surprising ending. Kind of like the Hitchcock movies."
1,Not thrilling at all.,I found the first few short stories I read very dull and not thrilling in the least. I'm sorry I made the purchase. Don't waste your money on this book.
4,Thiller,"There are a variety of stories within Thriller. Most are excellent with just one or two that I considered to be luke warm. The range is from espionage, mystery - both local and global, true thrillers, to stories that leave the conclusion up to the reader. I really enjoyed this book."
2,Disappointing...,"I bought this book with high expectations - certainly there are writers in this collection that should be able to write a fantastic short story, I thought.I was wrong.Most of the stories in this anthology were snippets, pieces of a much larger story. I usually love short stories but these left me wondering if any thriller writers actually write them for love anymore - or just for the $$$."
5,Nice overall collection!,"This is a nice collection of thrillers from various authors, each with their own style of narration. This is what makes the book unique. It gives a good collection of flavors from different authors in one book. Sure, there are some parts that are not so well written and may come across as boring, but there are some that are spectacular. It's a great read without having to stretch the entire book all at once. The short stories are quick reads for each session."
3,A good introduction to new favorites,I may have found some new authors to check out thanks to this compilation. The tricky thing with a compliation is that the styles and plots and subject matter are so spread out that you're bound to be excited by some stories and bored by others. There was only one story that I simply could not finish because the material was sooooo dated; a story about a Cold-War spy. The good thing is that it introduced me to some authors that I might not have taken a chance on otherwise.I'm not much on short stories because it typically cannot offer much in the way of character development or background. Seems like you just get into the characters' monds and the story is over which can be a frustration.
1,triller stories to keep you up,"Didn't relies that this book was not written by James Patterson, only edited by him. Book is boring and not up to James' normal standards. I forced myself to read it, but did skip over some of the stories. Nephew in law didn't like either. We are true James Patterson's fans and this book fell real short!!!!!!"
2,a long journey,"I thought this product would be a good way to broaden my horizon of thriller writers, especially since I drive a lot and get sick of the radio. It certainly includes a lot of stories from a lot of writers, many of them famous. But I was disappointed. The stories are weak, compared to the novels of those writers I've read. One of the best stories is the first, by Lee Child, who is probably my current favorite thriller writer. Beyond that I would say there are three stories that really work out of the whole bunch. There must be 30 or so in all. It's a long wade through mediocrity to get to the good, and the good are just good, not great. I would recommend buying a novel on CD from a writer you know you like."
3,Good Sampler and Introduction to Various Authors,"I enjoyed the bios of the authors at the beginning of the stories.As a writer myself, listening to the stories on the audio cd was very helpful in discerning the varied rhythms and voices of the stories. I am a psychologist by day and The Portal was my favorite.What wonderful group affiliation between all these talented authors.I hope they will continue to welcome new thriller writers into their fold!"
3,A Little Disappointing,"Thrillers are thrillers, but I just wasn't that thrilled with this collection of short stories. Many of the stories come to fruition with little thrill, as if you saw it coming. Some of the stories come off more like action movies, but not so much a thriller. While a few are ""hang on to the edge of your seat"" good, I found myself disappointed that the James Patterson touch I was looking for just wasn't there enough to keep me interested though all 14 CDs."
3,Disappointed,"Even though I liked some of the stories, I was disappointed with most. I thought the stories would have been more suspensful or as the title suggests... thrillers! However, it was mostly CIA, spy, or police tales. I didn't find them intersting at all."
2,Weak...,Save your $$ this is a weak par boiled collection edited by a man that does not even write his own novels... for a better thriller collection I suggest Jeffery Deavers' TWISTED better than this stuff!
3,Thriller,"Reading this book, gave me an change to read many different authors that in the past I had never read before. A good introduction to their work"
3,Reader beware retracted,I kept reading the short stories and some are certainly a lot better than the very first one. So I changed my opinion about this book. I love James Patterson books. I will buy the next one too.
3,"Just not as ""thrilling"" as I had expected","Before every short story, a history of the writer is given (in detail) and then the story is read. I would say one in every six of the stories are actually a thriller (and that is being generous). Stephen King could write short stories that kept you on the edge of your seat..many of these are seasoned writers but they can't pull it off..."
1,Very disappointing.,"This is a VERY disappointing collection of short stories. Of the 30 stories most are mediocre at best. A few are OK and only one, alas the very last one in the collection, is really good. This is by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child. Save your money - or wait for the paperback."
4,a good collection,"I brought this as a gift for someone, and after asking them what they thought of it i got a good response. The short story format suits the book, and a good collection of varied titles.This is a good book of writings by a collection of writers with different,styles and ideas but all under the umbrella of ""Thrillers"".This is an excellent book to buy, to ""dip your toe"" into the genre and to see if you like a particular writers style and content before you deceide to buy a book written by them.all in all recommended for people who like the short story format, and a lot of variety.So a 4* rating ( would have given it 5* but the copy i got was slightly damaged )"
1,Ho Hum...,"After reading many of the rave reviews I thought I'd give this book a shot. In my opinion the stories are missing substance. They never really get to the meat and potatoes, or if they do you haven't built any type of report with the characters to actually care.Two or three of the short stories hold a bit of water, but the rest are filler. I bought the book because of the James Patterson name as well as some of the authors that contributed.None of the short stories are scary, chilling, or terrifying, and this book is definitely not a 'thriller' to keep you up at night.R"
5,Thriller: Stories to keep you up all night,This is a very nice anthology of short stories written by authors you may know and have read. If you have not read stories by some of the authors this is your chance to get acquainted
4,Interesting if a bit slow,"The Bottom Line:Series 7: The Contenders is a razor-sharp satire of reality television that uses all the trappings of the metier it is skewering to make the film actually seem like a ""marathon"" edition of ""Series 7,"" the hot new show in which middle Americans hunt each other down on camera; the film is often more interesting in conception than in execution but it's still worth a look.3/4"
1,I want the last 85 mins of my life back!,"I can describe this movie in just one word: TERRIBLE.Everything about it was terrible - the production, the budget, the acting, the storyline (yes they have to kill each other for the show but why? what happens if they don't? did they enlist for the show? um why???? do they just keep killing until they are killed?), the character development (what was with the crazy old guy??) and finally the music (if you could call it that).I haven't written a review before but felt it was my civic duty to warn others not to watch this. If only I could rewind time and have those 85mins back. You have been warned."
4,Cute and Unique!,"I love this cuff, it is very cute, I got a lot of compliments from it. Personally I like it better than the typical cuffs you see out there. It was a little hard to put on at first since you need to pry open the arms, but other than that it should fit perfectly on the ear. The only thing I don't like about it is that it can come off very easily. I was wearing a circle scarf and while I took it off, it tugged the cuff right off. Also with something as small as this, it is easy to lose."
1,Man Ear Cuff,"Do NOT purchase this item! It does not fit properly on the ear, and when you try to wear it it falls off. In the picture it also depicts the cuff as larger than it actually is. I would not recommend this for anyone."
5,Magnificent,"It speaks for itself, this piece is awesome and unique, my second purchase of these and not disappointed, i'm so happy, such wonderful detail. Simply beautiful piece."
5,it's so cool,"ever since I saw this lady with this ear cuff, I""ve wanted to get one. well,,,,I""m so glad that i bought this..I get a lot of compliments....."
1,Useless for a multifunction printer,"I bought this for use with an HP OfficeJet 6110, a multifunction scanner/printer, because it was the recommended device for putting the printer on the network. However, after installing it, I found it doesn't support scanning or faxing using the multifunction printers - completely useless for the type of printer they recommend it for. Since HP doesn't seem to be able to make peripherals compatible with their own printers, you might as well just buy a cheaper alternative to start with."
5,Brilliant insight into an alcoholic's tortured mind,"This is one of the most eloquent and wrenching books ever written about the debilitating despair of a hopeless alcoholic. And there is no self-pity or drama, just a factual account of the last few days of this person's life in the Bowery. The style is crisp, incisive and poetic. It is a small book. My understanding is that this book was published posthumously after the author commiitted suicide. What a loss the literary world suffered, what a waste... except for this little gem he left behind!"
4,simple but functional,I bought this set after the one that came with the fondue set mysteriously disappeared. These have a color spot on the top of the fork which is handy to remember your fork. This is to be used for meat but you could use it for bread if the bread pieces are not too big.
1,TOO SHORT FOR SMORES,THIS PRODUCT WAS ADVERTISED TO ACCOMPANY THE SMORES KIT. WHEN I RECEIVED IT I REALIZED IT IS MORE FOR A FONDUE. THEY ARE TOO SHORT FOR SMORES AND THE HANDLES SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE OF WOOD. THEY MAY BE GREAT FOR A FONDUE BUT NOT FOR A CAMPSIGHTS.
5,fondue is back,i bought these fondue forks and put it in a basket with a small crock pot and chocolate and marshmallows and other great fondue dippers. i also added a fondue cookbook and gave them out as gifts for christmas. everyone loved them.
4,Perfect Fondue Forks,"I purchased two sets for the chocolate fountain we were having for my daughter's birthday party. These forks made it a lot more presentable and girls enjoyed using the forks. We also received the items very quickly, just in time for the party. I'll be using the sets each time I entertain with chocolate fountain."
5,Absolutely adorable!,"My young son and I adore Kipper, and the silly antics he and Tiger so unsuspectingly get themselves into. Arnold is a toot and so is each fun-filled episode. Such charming British accents, perfectly suited to the equally-charming and infectious soundtrack. ""He wasn't stuck after all!"" :-) Surely looking forward to future Kipper video releases."
1,Wrong DVD zone,"I'm sure that this would have been a great DVD - my kids love all the other Kipper ones. Unfortunately, I received a copy that does not work in DVD zone 1 (the US and Canada), so we never got to see it!"
1,The Worst of the Worst,"Wow. This is an unclear and confusing approach. The examples are not helpful, useless analogies and run-on sentences.It was a nightmare. Mind you I received an A- in the class - NOT thankful to the book whatsoever."
5,A very good mystery,"It was a good day that I found this Ben Reese mystery. It is well written, and I found it hard to put down. I want to read all of his books. Sally Wright is a gem."
3,"Good series, not the best book in it","I like this series as a whole, but found this particular book a bit slow. Worth reading as part of the series."
5,Excellent,The author really weaves some good suspense into this book and it is an excellent mystery.
4,A small flaw,"The book is set in the sixties. Ben Reese the detective mentions what he was doing that day, one of the things what that he was reading ""his Peter Wimsey"". I looked up at amazon.com to find Peter Wimsey. From what I see, it is a fictional detective writen about in the 21th century. So how can it be? hope somebody can explain that to me. Other than that, the book was fine. Pnina"
2,Short of story line,"The author seemed to have no idea where the story should go, so towards the end she thought up the solution"
1,Watch out for Sony Copy Protection - This DVD doesn't work on some systems.,"The DVD is no doubt excellent but Sony has a new copy protection system on it and despite trying two different sets neither one works with disc 1 (on 2 computer dvd drives and 1 independent DVD player connected to my monitor).It is obviously a copy protection scheme, good work Sony, I've stopped buying CD's and soon may stop on DVD's as well. You pay hundreds of dollars for DVD players and they go obsolete within a year or two because of new encoding, what a waste."
5,Garanteed to make you laugh,"Really great, a ""must have"" if you are a Seinfield fan, a really funny season well worth collecting! I have enjoyed it very much, and don't mind watching over and over, it always makes me laugh!!"
1,"Seinfeld: it wasn't funny then, and it is not funny now!","Seinfeld was one of the most overhyped sitcoms of all time. I can't believe people are still watching this garbage because the programme was never any good to begin with. I used to know so many people who were such huge fans of this show, but I had no idea why anybody would want to watch this show because the programming was so dull. Seinfeld wasn't even remotely funny. In fact, watching grass grow is more fun than watching Seinfeld. If you want to bore yourself into a mindless stupor, than this is the DVD for you! But if you want to be entertained, stay far away from this dated and formulaic cr@p. Its so boring! BORING BORING BORING!"
5,best one yet,"Might be the best season released.Many classic episodes (Marine Biologist, Puffy Shirt, Pigman), and some pretty good extras this time around.Good stuff from the actors/writers with their takeson classic episodes and a great segment that features Jason Alexander vs. Costanza vs. Larry David.Seinfeld's speech at the Smithsonian, along with some funny insights about Jerry Stiller helping to give Frank Costanza a little flair."
5,Im so gald for these DVDs!,"These shows will be kept in my top shelf for ages and Im sure they're something my kids will watch later in life n love.Cmon, we cant really choose a favorite show or season even. tey're all so very very good! The briss.. that guy is so akward.See, one of the great things about Seinfeld is that the main characters are great but the side-kicks, eventual characters or even once-in-a-lifetime apearences are so impressive. The oposite is fantastic, George tops himself again in the Marine Biologist episode. ""its not a lie...if you believe it"" the motto for his life is really paying off on thi season. GREAT, all in all its the middle part of a 9 year MASTERPIECE!"
5,In fantastic condition!,"It got here in about a week, and it looks like it was taken out of the shrink wrap yesterday."
5,"Duh, it's Seinfeld","I love this season! The infamous puffy shirt episode is in it, along with one of my fave's ""The Cigar Store Indian"" (I'm native american and got a hoot out of it). If you purchase no other season of Seinfeld, purchase this one AT LEAST!"
2,"Great series, but disc 3 won't play!","Please don't take my two star review as a slight against Seinfeld. I think this show is great! However, I purchased all 9 seasons from Amazon and have been working my way through them. When I got to disc 3 of season 5 it simply wouldn't play one of the episodes. It would start up and go for a few minutes and then nothing. Just frozen. I tried a number of different players, and my computer reports the disc as damaged. When I take it out, it looks fine to me (as it should since I just got it last week). I'll be returning and reordering with hopefully better results. I'll update my review once I get a refund and my new copy."
4,Seinfeld Season 5,I received my order in a timely manner and it was in good condition. I was satisfied with my purchase.
5,Gift 4A Friend,my friend loves this series so anytime i need a present for him - i pick the next season. it's always a hit.
1,amazon you suck,"i ordered this over a month ago and it still has yet to show up...i had so much faith in you before this. maybe the pust office f'd this one up, but if not, you are losing a loyal customer..."
1,Not for me,"I purchased this for my daughter in law for her dad, so I can't really rate this. I personally don't like the show."
4,Seinfeld,"Anyone who has seen Seinfeld doesn't need me to tell them how good it is. If you want to laugh, buy it"
5,One of the funniest seasons ever! Nice bonuses!,"The Seinfeld Season 5 is one of the funniest season of any show ever. So much variety. You will love it! The DVD set also has documentary and commentary for each show, and even deleted scenes never seen before! I enjoyed these too. Now I know how and why they chose these people for the show. I highly recommend this show and season to everyone."
5,Seinfeld- best sitcom ever,"I watch this with my older brothers all the time. We loved Season 5. Heck, we just love Seinfeld in general. It's easily the best sitcom out there. You can relate to some of the problems. Not all obviously but some. We love watching this on DVD with no commercials and laughing our butts off most of the time. Amazon sends this in good condition. I was too little to watch this in the 90s but i'm 18 now and my parents always tell me what a hit this show was and how many episodes they've watched too. Seinfeld is a comedy for the family!! Still going strong by season 5. Even through season 8 where most shows get a little tiresome unless done well like this one.BEST sitcom ever!"
1,Misinformation,"The text says it's a spinning rod, but the photo shows a casting rod. So which is it? This is obviously a mistake, but should have been proof-read more carefully.[...]"
3,Would be nice,would love to make a comment on this book but have now been waiting almost six weeks for delivery
2,"Interesting, but nothing great.","I have always been interested in the JFK assassination, so this was a definite buy. It was very interesting, but if you have watched other progams regarding the subject, it offers nothing new. Very educational though, for people not as familiar to the JFK assassination."
3,Something different,"I found the no-Grassy-Knoll revelation disturbing - considering eye witnesses and the physics involving initial impact [Physicists please assist].However, viewers who believe strongly in the Knoll as the fatal bullet source may be surprised (as I was) to learn of a potential location for a second behind the limousine assassin plus the Russian idea that this character Oswald was even nuttier than Gerald Ford said he was - and that it *had* to be someone else.A lazer beam test is run and it's compelling...although even a *high speed* bullet doesn't duplicate a lazer.Dr. Posner is on the scene once again with his connect the dots story of a nobody -Oswald - trying to be a somebody...at the expense of a President's life."
2,Lots of Hype,"Lots of hype but very little content. In the end, they side with the Warren Commission Report, which is now falling apartas time passes and more info emerges. This program kept baiting you with the promise of ""more to come"", but it neverdelivers."
3,Documentary style...,Can be a little boring...but interesting to see what lengths the KGB went to to say it had nothing to do with JFK's death
2,worth it for Dr. McClelland and some bits and pieces,"While I was very disappointed with this dvd, it is worthwhile to have Dr. Robert McClelland and some bits and pieces of pro-conspiracy research. Other than that, thank God it is cheap!!!Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
4,Nina Hynes - New Irish Viewpoint,"Nina Hynes grew up in Dublin in a pub, listening to and surrounded by music all her life. Her first CD, Creation, has only six songs, but they are an ecclectic and fresh approach to today's rather unstylistic music scene. The best song, This Magic Stuff, is very captivating. However, the other songs are an interesting bonus. They may take a few tries to get accustomed to, but I like it."
1,almost worthless,"This is a fine concept, completely unrealized. I bought it for grandchildren, but it would insult their intelligence. Authors picked out a very few species of charismatic, or at least colorful caterpillars, and left it at that. They did not bother to mention that only two or three of these stars occur throughout the US. Nor do they bother mentioning that 3/4 of all caterpillars will become moths, not butterflies. Nothing useful about how to look for caterpillars. Peterson Guides should have hired someone who cared about caterpillars and kids at least a little."
3,Another picture book about the fall of Saddam.,"More great pictures about the 2003 War in Iraq and the fall of Saddam Hussein. As in the Time book about the same campaign, there are some great pictures in this book. On the writing side, there is little meat in this book and for one to better understand this conflict, they need to read elsewhere. However the pictures are great and one will get a general idea on why the war was waged.Some of the pictures in this book are graphic in nature. It would probably not be wise to leave this book around young children. Those pictures just prove to everybody that war is hell."
5,nice shirt great price,A nice quality T-shirt for a great price. Fits well and the shirt is thick unlike some of these new shirts that are so thin you can see thru them.
3,Great! But . . . . .,"This book starts out great, because it really makes it clear for us idiots the reason electrons are pushed. It is an engaging study tool that makes you want to open the book everyday. The problem with the book, I'm now learning, is that I now know how to push electrons, but I still don't know when to apply what rules. I thought that the book would have talked more about how to identify electrophiles, and nucleophiles (with regards to reagents). Instead the books jumps for being really easy to follow, to asking the reader to attempt really complex mechanisms. That's like asking a kid who just learned his ABC's to write a book. Very poor ending.However, for those of you who are clear on electrophiles and nucleophiles, this book would be perfect for you. I suspect that if you know those well, you might not need this book."
2,Good try but terrible writing,"I'm a big fan of fantasy books and although this book seemed promising, in the end it sucked. The storyline was ok to pretty good but the writing style was terrible! There was bad transitions and the writing was very choppy. Just goes to show that a good idea doesn't always lead to a good product."
2,Who cares?,"This book tries much too hard to be the only fantasy story you ever need to read. The author starts with a couple ofapathetic orphans living in a Brigadoon-like enchanted town of retired Sea Witches, then throws in every fabledcreature from selkies to the Ancient Mariner, inventions from Atlantis, invisibility spells, Light Witches (""good"")and Night Witches (""evil""), modern pollution, and magical Ice Dust from the arctic reminiscent of PhilipPullman's metaphysical Dust. Everything in this book is derivative and reminiscent of another classic fantasy.What's worse: no character in the book feels the wonder and awe of all this magical paraphernalia, and no oneseems to care much about what happens, so neither does the reader."
1,Van Cleef & Arpels,This was always my favorite cologne. I ordered it via Amazon. The company they used must also makepickles. It stinks. I've used this spray for over ten years. I will go back to purchasing it intheir store in Manhattan. Twice friends brought it back from the Caribbean when they were oncruises and I got a price break...but never have I ever smelled something like this. This companydidn't even come close.
4,Biography,"Actually Mrs. Thurmond was very real. Considering that this is a Biography and not a Novel, it would not be likely to have a plot contrived or otherwise. Historical fiction has a plot, but this is not historical fiction.Now, if someone is truly interested in history, I would recommend this book. Until recently facts about Ms. Deno were a bit elusive and research was difficult. The author has worked hard to research and share the facts about this lady gambler. There are spots where improvement could be made, but on the whole I would recommend the work as a glimpse into the life of someone worth learning about."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"A poorly written story that occurs in the old west. The main character is a female con artist, gambler. The entire plot is totally predictable."
2,the last solution,I bought this remote because I thought that it can operate the PIP functions and will serve as a solution for the lousy Samsung TV remote that I have.It did not! The buttons are hard to push and some of the functions don't work like the Audio swap between the two pictures in PIP or the main menu button. My recommendation Don't waste your money on this product.Now my 16 months baby uses it as a toy.
2,Bait and switch marketing,"I just received this can, and while it is nice enough, it does not remotely resemble the image posted here of a black can with a large A symbol.It is red, with a bat and baseball background."
3,"Good, but","THIS WAS A NICE FIND. ONE OF MY FAVORITE SOUNDTRACK SONGS, ON ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANIMES. HOWEVER THE SONG I REALLY BOUGHT THIS ALBUM FOR WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. INSTEAD IT WAS MIXED WITH STRINGS AND NOT SANG AS SOULFULLY, WHICH MADE THE HIGH PRICE ALMOST NOT WORTH IT. BUT ENJOYED THE TALENTS OF KIEKO LEE, ALL THE SAME AND HOPE SHE COMES TO THE BAY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, SO I CAN GET TO SEE AND HEAR HER PERFORM LIVE.~LLOYD C.~"
2,Custom floor mats for 2008 Dodge Ram 1500,"The floor mats fit well. The driver's side mat does not have an eyelet for the retention hook mounted to the floor, and that is disappointing as the description says they exist when ""required"" (and the general photo shows two eyelets). The floor mats are a much lighter gray than the gray interior of the pickup. But the mats are thick and should last a long time.Edit 11/16/2012: I've changed my rating to 2 stars from 4. Now that I've lived with these for a few months, the need for support of the retention hook is apparent. The driver's side mat creeps pretty fast. And just the other day the accelerator pedal got stuck under the mat. Pretty exciting few seconds before I realized what happened. That dangerous condition would NOT happen if it hooked into the pickup's existing retention hook!"
3,Ms. Pam,I realize the bag stated its size but I thought the bags were a little bigger. They are cute but they are too small.
4,Really nice instrumental piano covers of Sir Elton's classics,"I first heard this CD in, of all places, a sushi bar, and was surprised how nicely it complimented the relaxed dining atmosphere. I grew up with the originals and am often skeptical towards covers--""if it ain't broke, don't fix it, it was done right the first time."" But a wiser me knows that good songs are good songs no matter the artist and, if done well, transcend musical eras and genres. Boko Suzuki's ""classical piano"" treatment does just that. Great for entertaining or just kicking back. A tribute to the talent of both men."
5,A great light weight conditioner...,"This conditioner goes so well with the Tea Therapy shampoo! Not only does it get the job, as far as conditioning, but it also has a lovely smell. I feel like I am bathing in tea, all day, whenever I use the shampoo and conditioner, as a packaged deal. Very nice!"
4,Love the smell of this,This is perfect for co washing. Love the smell of it. I wish they had this readily available in the stores.
4,An Exceptionally Gifted Vocalist,"I have been a Larnelle Harris fan since the 1980s. He is one of my all time favorite male vocalists and I was lucky enough to attend one of his concerts in 1992. He has such an amazing voice. This is a very enjoyable cd. Most of the songs are great. I especially love the lyrics to the song ""Open Door"", ""Let's make our hearts an open door, inviting every race, embracing rich and poor, God's Kingdom will grow like it never has before, when we make our hearts an open door"". What a great message."
4,Larnelle Live,"Eye of the beholder type purchase. Delivery slightly delayed. Case cracked, but still in original packaging; noteworthy because purchased as a gift. No other abnormalities. CD plays fine."
3,Note: you need to be able to run Mac 'classic' (OS9 or earlier) to use!,"I was very disappointed to find that this disc is only usable in what Maccalls 'Classic' mode, something that is unavailable on any of the newerIntel Macs, or any Mac running 10.5 or later.(Technically, there are some work arounds to run ""classic"" on a newerMac, but if you Google them, you'll see they're not easy, and requiretime, effort, and it seems like some trial and error.)The 3 stars was a bit arbitrary, I had to put something, and thought thisinformation was valuable to potential consumers."
3,Meh - Off the rails,"The thrill is gone. No chemistry. No tension. The show is snoozable because it's predictable. There's no good situational tension--will they catch the bad guy? Of course. Will Fiona's life be threatened in prison? Of course. Because the writers are covering two ""A"" storylines, there's little room for humor or playing on the relationships we've come to love over the past 5 years. There's not even the decent presence of a villan to hate.Car chases without decent explosions - yawnMadeline as an ineffectual delivery girl? bleah (In season 5, Madeline would have figured out a clever way to get the package away from the creep and get it to Fiona on her own.)Sam without mojitos and snappy observations - vanillaMichael without a cool cover story - why bother?Fiona without killer shoes, sexy clothes, and C4 - not happenin'"
5,AWESOME SHOW,LOVE BURN NOTICE HAVE ALL THE SEASONS LOVE THE ACTION ITS REALLY REALLY AWESOME AN INTENSE HOPE THEY CAN DO IT FOR SOME TIME
4,Good TV Series,"Despite the suspended reality in virtually every episode, this is a fun show to watch to simply sit back and decompress. My only beef is how skinny Fee (the heroine) is in real life...anorexic actually."
2,"Really? After Nate Weston's death, this is what we get???","After a key episode (Shock Wave) that ends with the death of Michael Weston's brother, we get Reunion. A mundane episode that sets the audience up with more of the same. This show is smarter than that. Or is it? I hope it is, cause if not, I have just invested too many years watching it for not much of a gain.I am still a fan. But I have seen too many serials (i.e. The Matrix, Battlestar Galactica -the new one, The X-Files) that ramble on an on with the promise that it will all make sense, and tie together and be great, only to have it fizzle and suck in the end.I rarely write reviews. But I figure I would this time. Perhaps Matt Nix and crew will read it, and other similar reviews, and work to ensure this show does not suffer a crappy fate.KJ"
5,Still Love It,"Burn Notice has been one of my favorite shows of all time. (spoiler alert) It has become a little more serious and intense since Nate was killed. This season has been a little tedious and less fun with so much focus on the painfully slow-moving plot line of the gang escaping Miami. Character relationship development is almost at a standstill and I am ready for some forward motion with respect to Michael's re-burned status with the CIA. That said, I will never stop watching this show and loving these characters!"
5,"Don't have it yet, but I loved Ssn 6...",I LOVE this show so much! I pre-ordered season 6 the minute Amazon made it available. It's just THAT GOOD...
3,Disappointing,"Once again the writers fell into the trap of doing the same thing over, and over, and over, again. They had the opportunity to be cool, but blew it. They really would have been better off to end the season (and the show) with a good conclusion, than trying to push an opening for a new season with the same old disappointment. I may not bother with next season."
5,One of the best seasons ever,Burn Notice has some of the best writers. Their form of storytelling keeps me engaged. I love all of the characters and look forward to the next episode.
5,gets better each season,"this is awesome, great story line. the intensity and cliffhangers are there. always coming back for more. love the show and Gabrielle Anwar."
3,Better than nothing (barely),I love the show. I just wish the streaming didn't STOP four or five times during each and every episode. It is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING and not worth the price and I won't pay for anymore videos from Amazon. You guys suck. Get your s*** together.I DO NOT RECOMMEND AMAZON ONLINE VIDEO TO ANYONE.
3,same old same old,"I'm a faithful Burn Notice fan and have convinced others to watch it. It was amazing how each season brought something new and fresh but to me the second half of season six is too narrowly focused. I know the producers think the fans want more action but enough already. each show is blending into the other and they don't put enough emphasis on the characters. It's one shoot em up blow em up after another. And Fiona and Michael, isn't this the great love of their lives? Fiona is bitchy and rude and Michael, well, he's character is the one best developed because he is going down this dark path. And now Sam is all shmarmy (that is a real word) and Jesse, still just the sidekick. I thought they might do more with him but then just let it slide. I like to watch shows that I really like over again because it's interesting what you miss the first time around. There's not one on seasons six that would entice me to watch again."
4,I like this show!,I love this show. It is fun and exciting. Thanks for making it available! The story line is great and I like the characters.
5,STILL A FAN!,"This season was much better than I expected! I was growing weary of Michael having to go up against local hoodlums. Season 6 was MORE of the Spy vs Spy I've come to love about ""Burn Notice!"""
4,"Great continuation, Liked it better than 5","Thought this season was a great continuation of the series, felt some threads were tied up, but I can say I am not sure how next season will be. Certainly feels like the road to hell is being paved with good intentions"
5,Priceless Burn Notice Action,Couldnt wait for DVD to come out and had to have this! Great interface and it is so fast and easy to pull them up!
5,Very enjoyable,I enjoyed the series. I hope that future episodes do't become predictable. I am thankful that there is not more more language and skin than is necessary to keep the program interesting.
4,Strong season but fading fast...,"I am not sure how to keep the humor and light side of this series and get that edgey feel back that was in season 3 and 4. They keep dredging up management to carry over from show to show and tie the plot knot, but it is wearing thin. I love the Sam Axe character and really think they need to try a serious show of just Sam again, getting some of that Seal Storyline out in front and then have him joke away the danger and seriousness of the job. They need to pump up the budget and get some heavy acting in there again, maybe a cameo by an A-Lister Drama series actor or some of the Sopranos characters. Many of them would be perfect in sunny florida, reprising their roles in jersey south. Let them do a miniseries... 3 or 4 episodes, making funny and getting that miami/new york mob connection going again in the plotline."
4,Nicely done!,"I enjoyed the season opener. Wisely, the story started just at the point the last season's story ended. There was a familiar face interrogating Fiona and a perception of betrayal between key characters (still to be resolved). I enjoy the way the character of Michael's mother (the wonderful Sharon Gless) continues to develop, taking actions she likely would have been too afraid to take when the series began. And I'm happy to see that Coby Bell is now in the opening credits. His character's energy fits well with the other characters, yet he maintains a distinctive viewpoint.As for the explosions, I admit that I'm no connoisseur, but things went ""boom"" and there was smoke and flames. Worked for me."
4,Deep,"This was a good episode, but broke my heart. Got to my heart strings. I will say no more, do not want to create a spoiler. Worth watching for sure."
5,good but i didnt buy this...,weird def didnt buy this......... time to open up an investigation. dont get me wrong i love the show so
5,I love this show,I love this show ! !I love this show! I love this show! I love this show ! I love this show !
5,Love this show!,I love the fact that a guy like me doesn't have to have HBO to see a good show anymore!
5,Burn Notice Review,"Quality streaming, great storyline.Looking forward to watching the rest of the season.Amazon makes it very easy to watch."
2,Did the real writers quit?,"What is the deal with these horrible scenes, extraordinarily cheesy lines (thank God they didn't hit my chin""?? and just weak sub plots all around? They're ruining a great show."
3,"Easy to access, but cheap video quality",I love that amazon makes it easy to view my video content. But if you are going to advertise HD quality video you should actually deliver HD quality video.Skip amazon HD streaming videos for now and just stick with regular definition. You won't notice much different. I haven't.
1,Burn Notice Season 6,"Very disappointing season all around. The writers seem to be out of ideas...and the focus on the love affair is just not all that interesting. Even when some great guest stars were brought back this season (Jason Bly, Carmelo, Bruce Geller)...they were underused. The show, for the first 5 seasons, was sassy, sharp, fun....I am hoping that some new and creative ideas can revive Burn Notice....."
3,Disappointed,I really liked the first few seasons of Burn Notice. But this one kind of jumped the shark. It felt schizophrenic and like the writers had no idea where they were going.
4,"Love the series, a bit grainy on instant video","My hubby and I are hooked. We saw the previews and thought it may be a bit cheesy and like very other spy movie, but the characters develop well, their relationships and the action are not overly predictable. The twists and turns are a bit to keep track of, but I'm well pleased they aren't easily predictable.We only use Netflix and simply couldn't wait for season six so we are paying for instant view. It is a bit grainy and you can't pause unless you want you wait nearly 60 sec for the picture and audio to sync. I love the show!"
5,burn notice season 6,"I have never enjoyed a TV series as much as Burn Notice. It is funny,loving,hard life,compassinate, and yes sometimes aliitle cruel. It portrays real life. The Actors are so well matched to their parts, they get your heart racing at times. It is exciting and for me, has got me through alot of lonesome depession at time, It is worth the money -- if you love to be intertained !!!Amazon gets the latest series on line, quicker then anyone, so you can watch evrery week. I have bought every season and every series.Thanks Amazon,Ms.Paula"
4,Keep your eye on the ball,"I liked it better when she was his ex-girlfriend. We are three episodes into this season and not one mention of a mojito. Remember the good old days when Michael would come to the aid of little old ladies who are beaten up by punks and did not receive help from the police. I don't know if they simply took their eye off the ball or Jeffrey Donovan is trying to win an Emmy as a distraught lover, but its not the same anymore. More action, less crying. Leave that for the Lifetime network."
1,How can the Sixth Season fit on ONE DISK ?,"The details now show season six as a 1-disk product. If this is the case it is way over priced.I hope this is a mistake that gets corrected, or I will need to cancel my pre-order.I at three dollars an episode, it will be more cost effective to down load the HD episodes one at a time.Can you say iTunes ?"
3,new season,How can I review something that hasn't arrived /been released yet? anxiously waiting season 6 release.have enjoyed one - five
2,Missing last 12 minutes,"So, this episode is missing the last 12 minutes...wasn't able to finish watching it. Which really stinks because I love Burn Notice!"
2,A little too long at the fair,"When it first appeared ""Burn Notice"" was a change of pace from the usual detective/spy genre. The excellent cast had some interesting stories and some good underlying tension, not only between the lead actors but also the suspense about the back story. Over the years, the tension has dissipated, the back story has been filled to overflowing, and what used to be fine, crisp acting has gotten a little less crisp and fine. The fine photography remains the same, but that's about it. If you're not familiar with this series, by all means take a look at some of their earlier work, but the more recent programs have left me disappointed."
1,Still have not received... after several months!,"We ordered in September. . . still have not received the DVD. They should not have promo'd the product so early, if it was known that it would not be ready for deliver for several months!"
4,"The most intense, unpridictable season yet",I can't give it a 5 star rating because I almost dread watching it each week. I just want something to go right so I can relax for a few minutes.
5,Burn Notice All seasons,"I had watched this program since the very first airing! It is one of the best shows on any network! The wife loves it, even though it can get a little crazy at times. The thing between mom, brother and Mike is great, just like real life, well maybe a little out of the box. But Sam and Fee are a great back up team for Mike. Everything is so well done. I wonder sometimes if the producers studied under Micheal Mann, because of the beginning and ending of the shows, the music and the outfits the troops wear. Well anyway 4 thumbs up from us."
2,Penalty for unnecessary yuckiness.,"My family has really enjoyed watching Burn Notice this summer. We block the screen during the bikini shots. In the past 5 seasons, there were a few nightclub dance scenes we mostly just listened to. This episode had two scenes that were basically unwatchable due to sexual content. In my opinion, it was way beyond TVPG. I saw two seconds and then only heard the rest of the one scene. That was yuck enough. Then they had to show yucky blackmail pictures in another scene. That was completely unnecessary. I am really hoping this downward trend does not continue, because it has been a fun series."
3,this is getting very annoying,"I've started to write this review the last two episodes and ended up not publishing. Forty-four Seconds worth of ""When you're burned..."" then another forty-five seconds of ""Previously on burn notice..."" That's what it was the last two episodes. This episode goes a full two minutes before it actually gets to the current episode. If there's anyone watching this episode who doesn't know what a Burn Notice is then they need go back and watch Season 1 and, while a few little ""catch me up"" clips might be reasonable I think 1 minute and 15 seconds worth is excessive. When I was assigned a two page paper in Middle School I would change the line spacing in Word Perfect to 1.2 because it allowed me to write less and the teacher probably wouldn't notice..."
2,Sub Par,"Something must have changed with the creative staff because this episode was really limping. The plot seemed cursory. The acting was rough as if each scene had fewer takes then normal. Accents were uneven. The climatic explosion was shoddy. Clearly some prop towers exploded revealing the larger building completely unscathed. The only thing it demolished was any tension or doubt about Sam's survival. Fiona's interrogation scenes were poorly executed as well. She's keeps her nice dress and jewelry, no jail jump suit for her. One wonders if she was even searched. All in all I hope this isn't indicative of the remainder of the season."
5,great,This is a great series and I am so glad I can see it on Amazon. I do not have USA on my cable.
5,Perfect combination and integration!,"This book is exactly what I was looking for... it offers a great yoga workout in each stage of postpartum recovery and getting back into shape, and it also integrates your infant. A lot of programs are either primarily focused on the infant (and, let's face it, we as new moms are the ones who need the workout and the release that comes with it), or forget the baby altogher having you leave your little one lying next to you (which is impossible once they become mobile). This book combines both and integrates yogic movements with your baby and without, depending on the move, as well as giving tips on infant stimulation throughout the practice. It also teaches different asanas to practice based on the age of your infant. It is the perfect yoga book for new moms!"
5,Flawless!,"This is one of the few books that I know of which illustrate real yoga positions done with a baby. The instructions are clear and easy to follow and the pictures are beautiful! These positions are a wonderful way to bring your baby into your yoga routine and baby really delights in all of the attention, and face to face contact you are able to give while you practice!"
5,highly recommend,"i get to actually do yoga with my high-energy baby, not just putting him on the floor. creative and fun."
1,HARD TO READ,"By the time I was done reading an excersice and trying to figure out what they meant, my baby was crying and screaming on the yoga mat. This book is very hard to understand. If I was doing the Yoga by myself I wouldn't mind taking a bit of time to figure out what they mean, but with a baby it is a totally different story. Bottom line this book was not written with mother and baby reading in mind."
1,Please don't waste your money,This toy is totally useless. It deosn't make any noise nor does it move forward or backward electronically. It's a old age toy.
3,Mediocre TV Movie,"I just watched this movie with some friends and it's mediocre at best. The is a ok story that somewhat keeps your attention but it's something you would see on tv. The movie in not high calliber in anyway, heck it wasn't really even that sensual.....but is it worth a watch? sure"
5,Interesting view of the After-Life,"I just got a Pinkwater's eye view of what the afterlife holds for ""diametrically challenged"" people. ""The Afterlife Diet"" is classic Pinkwater, but for ADULTS. It is fun to read a book that makes you laugh out loud. At times it's a bit challenging to follow the various characters and story lines, but everything gets wrapped up rather nicely. I was lucky to find a hardcover edition in new condition through Amazon as the book is no longer in print. I don't think Michele Obama will be reading this book out loud anytime soon."
2,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"First let me say that I love Daniel Pinkwater in general and I've heard many of his NPR commentaries and read some of his other books. But that aside this was one of the worst books I've ever read. It wasn't funny as many of Pinkwater's pieces are. It wasn't insightful. It wasn't interesting. Only two things keep me from rating this a one and that's that Pinkwater is a good writer and the book is well written (i.e. gramatically correct, clearly worded, etc.) and that I've also read PINBALL by Jerzy Kosinski which is the worst book I ever read.So if you'd like to read something funny and thought provoking read something by Daniel Pinkwater other than THE AFTERLIFE DIET"
3,Pretty good,"I love the last song ""Ordinary Miracle"" by Sarah M. The rest of the CD is ok - would like it better if there were a couple more songs on there, rather than just musical scores."
4,"Love the movie, love the music","I'm not a huge fan of orchestral music, but this is a great CD if you are a fan of the movie. The more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it. Of course, the last song ""Ordinary Miracle"" is phenomenal! It's a beautiful song and Sarah McLachlan's voice is amazing."
4,Beautiful,"What a beautiful soundtrack. My little guy loves the score, but my favorite is the last track by Sarah McLachlan. It is the most wonderful song and brings tears to my eyes when I hear it. I haven't even seen the movie yet, but I am certainly looking forward to it. With such a star-studded cast of voices, plus Dakota Fanning, it can't be anything less than awesome!"
3,One song,The movie was great and I'm behind. There was only one song or artist I was interested in. I loved the new movie but I also read the book in the 4th grade.
4,Lovely music,"I have to say that there are a few boring songs, but I love most of them. I like to listen to them over and over again and I never get sick of it! Thank you sooooo much Danny Elfman! I hope this review helps!"
5,Elfman Continues His Streak!,"After the successes of ""Charlie & The Chocolate Factory,"" & ""Corpse Bride,"" Danny Elfman roars back in fine form with a soundtrack reminiscent of ""Big Fish,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Sommersby"" and ""Black Beauty."" If you're a die-hard or even just a casual Elfman fan, this should be on your list of upcoming purchases!"
2,Eh - movie soundtrack without songs with lyrics,"This soundtrack does not include the songs with lyrics, so my three-year-old son was not terribly entranced."
5,"It's GLAD, what else can I say...","AWESOME awesome, exactly what I wanted and ordered! I was very pleased with this product and its condition and have enjoyed my time listening to this great group! I am sure you too will enjoy this if you love acapella music giving all glory and praise to God!"
5,Great music - CD in great condition,I liked everything except that the cd case was cracked. I just replaced it. No problem. It is a fantastic musical experience.
2,Couldn't listen to the music befor purchase,"Not my cup of tea! I would have loved to hear the music before I bought it, next time I'll be smarter"
1,What a disappointment!,"For some reason, a lot of my favorite vocal groups have really bombed on Christmas albums -- the Nylons certainly did, and I add Glad to that list. As a fan of a cappella vocal music of all kinds, I have enjoyed several of Glad's previous outings. This one, however, was a huge disappointment! The song list leads you to believe you'll hear covers of traditional Christmas tunes, but they are in the minority -- there are ersatz melodies going on in most of them. And the arrangements are seriously lacking in imagination -- either too busy or too boring. Save your pennies and buy Manhattan Transfer, The Roches, or even Rockapella (which isn't fabulous all the way through but has some really great cuts)."
3,Revolutionary Road,This is well written and the author gives the reader insights to all the characters but it is a depressing story.
2,Disturbing with unlikeable characters,"Frank and April Wheeler seem to me self centered characters, so much so I don't have much sympathy for their problems. The book was plain disturbing and the ending horrible--supposedly there were psychological underlying causes stemming from the couple's childhoods (which were described) but no reason for April's desperate act at the end of the book. Also, the ending had the main character Frank disappear from the narrative and there is no knowing what becomes of him after what happens to April. I also think the two were very vapid and I didn't see anything sympathetic about either. The lack of morality or any humanity of the couple was just plain jarring."
2,Uncomfortable Indignities,"These characters were so miserable, and so unlikeable, I found myself anticipating at each new scene set-up what uncomfortable indignity would play out this time.The biggest literary crime was not just each individuals' lack of range (nearly every one judgmental, dishonest and insipid), but the uniformity of these unpleasant characteristics between the characters. Each one (at least up to 1/2 way through) clustered in the same literary space. Without a few noble souls to throw the self-indulgence into relief, the book was stifling.A depressing painting in monochrome blues and grays, is one thing, but a book is a linear journey through time for the reader, so the pain lasts and lasts. Unless you put it down -- which I did half way through."
2,"Nope, don't care","I'm about halfway through Revolutionary Road and it's unlikely I'll be able to finish as I have no real desire to find out what happens to Frank and April. Will they find marital bliss? Will someone die?I don't really care.The story is told predominantly from Frank's POV, and he is a shallow, selfish, immature lout. This makes you want to root for April, but she's pretty shallow and immature herself. Two young suburbanites who are watching life pass them by and dreaming of something more. BO-ring.The author has a nice writing style - very prosey and old-fashioned. If you like that sort of thing, you'll probably enjoy this book. But if you're looking for a page-turner that will grip you and make you want to read all night long, this isn't the one."
4,"Well-written, story of sad confused people...","With no belief system (philosophical, religious or otherwise) the characters in this novel flounder about helplessly looking for personal gratification, and come up empty. Convinced that they are, (or should be), superior to everyone else, they cannot find happiness or fulfillment in ""ordinary life"". When they see (as they inevitably must) that they are human and have flaws, they cannot face them. Instead they are plunged into self-loathing and despair, and the resulting behavior makes the situation much worse. These characters need to grow up, look outside of themselves and try to give to others, but they are too neurotic and self-absorbed. Thus, I was left feeling numb and sad. The writing is excellent, and rings true because so many in our society (both today, and in the 1950's when this was written) share this unfortunate perspective. Thought provoking reading..."
2,Revolutionary Road,"I wish I had read the book before seeing the movie. Maybe I would have appreciated the book more. I just didn't find anything likeable about the writing, the story, or the characters; however, I loved the movie. Not a keeper for me. 2.5 stars."
2,revolutionary bore,"while the themes and premise of this book are timeless and thought provoking, i found this book to be tedious and outright boring up until the last few pages. but then maybe that, along with all the charcters being unlikable, is the point. very disappointing after all the rave reviews i read."
1,Revolutionary Road,I really can't add anymore on how bad this book is. All the 5 stars reviews sound like they were written by Literature teachers who forgot the definition of enjoyable reading. The only positive thing I discovered is that I will never read a Richard Yates book again.
1,Revolutionary Road.,"Although I don't customarily like to review any literature as dated, this tragic look at mid-twentieth century suburbia feels that way. I just couldn't finish it and I almost never leave a book in the middle."
4,Alarmingly relevant still,"I had low expectations for this book, since the movie pretty much bombed, but found the subject matter to be suprisingly relevant, given that this was written in 1961. The characters, though a bit shallow, do seem real, and this book had me thinking for days afterward."
2,Hollywood Revisionism. BORING,"Did the really make a movie out of THIS?I thought that we were going to see the life of the characters AFTER they moved to Paris.Can we really expect that someone would be silly enough to quit their jobs, sell all of their belongs and then take a whole family (including children) to someplace where they didn't speak the language or have any contacts to find a job? And that they would trade a well paying job that was certain for this uncertainty?Can we imagine that someone would commit suicide over not being able to carry out this daft plan?If Hollywood wants to make a film to try to demonize the 1950s (which seemed to be the latent point of this), then they could at least have tried to do it in such a way as to keep the viewers awake."
5,Vivid,"I read every word, no skimming this time. For me it was a brilliantly written one-of-a-kind book. They don't write them like this anymore."
2,not for me,"Melancholy people would enjoy this book. Since I was reading it for a book club discussion, I had to force myself to finish it. Depressing as all get out. I don't get why people would want to read this story."
1,Hard to get through...,Did not like this book at all. Both April and Frank weren't characters I felt like I could root for. I bought the book because the trailers for the movie looked good. I wonder if this is a case where the movie would have been better. Just kind of boring throughout and I didn't really have sympathy for either character.
1,Couldn't continue....,"After seeing the movie preview (starring Dicaprio & Winslet), I decided to see if they have this book at local library. I had to be on a wait list for this book and was the 6th or 7th person in line. I thought this must be a really good book for the wait list to be that long.And boy, was I so wrong. When I finally got the book, I started to read it right away. I was forcing myself to read it and when I read up to where they were talking about the rumors of Mrs. Givings' son in the loony bin, I couldn't read any further.I don't know why so many readers love this book so much. But for me, it's way boring and uninterested. I didn't care about any of the characters or willing to read further to find out about the characters and their lives.This book is the first book I returned to the library after reading so little of it. On to my next book......."
1,"shallow, selfish, predictable","So disappointed in this 50s story. Was motivatedd to finish, thinking the rave reviews had to make it worth it. It was not. In all fairness, the book may have seemed revolutionalry at the time is was written, but now it just seems cliche."
3,characters have great power but the plot is not worthy of them,"Yates had a gift for catching the interest of the reader and holding it to thevery end. However, he seems driven (at least in this book) to make the livesof his characters meaningless, depressing and driven. If this were to make apoint, fine, but more often it seems to be his goal for its own sake alone.And some elements of his plot seem to hang there for no reason. WhyApril was so devastated by the play (and her part in it) recounted at the beginningis never developed. And the repeated clashes with John (son of the Givings who are neighbors)seem to be somewhat pointless.My memory of the book will always be that Yates wrote characters with greatpower but didn't have a plot worthy of them."
5,A period drama that's still applicable today,"I'm biased: this is my favorite book ever. I read this and The Great Gatsby every year. Yes, the subject matter is depressing and has cringe-worthy moments, but I think that's why I enjoy the book so much. Revolutionary Road peels back the facade of perfect suburban life and shows the ugliness underneath through the frustrations of Frank and April Wheeler, a couple who dreams of a better life than the ""good life"" they presently have. Yates's narrator details their story with a touch of snark, which keeps this story from being a complete downer. Despite the unlikable characters (for example, Frank is pretentious and all talk, April is flighty, and Mrs. Givings is that annoying neighbor you go out of your way to avoid), this is an engrossing read that details how people can deceive themselves into believing they're better people than they really are. A classic."
5,A Masterpiece,"I can add nothing to the blurbs copied immediately below, except to say that they're all true:""Having heard for years that Richard Yates' Revolutionary Road was one of the great but underappreciated American novels, I searched it out. I have spent the months since then pressing it into the hands of anybody who will take it."" Richard Lacayo, introducing Time's 100 Best Novels.""A deft, ironic, beautiful novel that deserves to be a classic."" William Styron, on Revolutionary Road.""The Great Gatsby of my time...one of the best books by a member of my generation."" Kurt Vonnegut, on Revolutionary Road"
1,well written with one star,"I grew up in the 50s, so when I saw this book, I just had to read it. Although well written, it turned out to be the most boring book I've read in a long time. I wanted to care about the people, but didn't. I was waiting for the wittiness, but there was none. I need to care about the people & found that totally missing in this book. It's not the 50s I remember."
3,Nothing Spectacular,"In a nutshell, I found Revolutionary Road to be a book about people who have trouble dealing with everyday life. The problems that the characters deal with are not earth-shattering, just things that could happen to anyone. I think that is why the book seems depressing, because the more I read, the more I thought, ""Why can't they just deal with this""! This was an easy, fast read, but there are a lot of books that I would recommend before this one."
1,just awful!,"I am so glad to see that I am not the only one that hates this book. I bought it only because of the movie being out right now, I thought I would read the book first (aren't the books supposed to be better?). If that's the case, the movie must really stink. This had to be the most boring book I have ever read. I haven't finished it yet, and I don't know if I will waste my time in doing so."
1,BORING,"I'm so glad to see other people found this just as boring. I saw the movie and was so moved by it I knew I just HAD to read the book, as is in most cases the book blows the movie well out of the water. So, if the movie was wonderful, the book had to be FANTASTIC!Boy was I wrong! Poorly written, SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. You feel dragged through the dirt of never ended depression and bore. I'm an avid reader and couldn't finish this garbage.See it soon in my garage sale."
5,Excellent Book.......,"While I did find the style a little wordy, the story was well written and timeless. If you have not seen the movie (like me) or even if you have it is well worth taking a peek at this story. The characters are real, the author has taken great care to fill in the back stories related to their emotional issues."
2,not my cup of tea,"I always try to read the book before I see the movie, but after reading this book, I can't bring myself to see the movie. I guess I am just into whiney tableaus of people who hate their life choices. Maybe it is an era thing?"
4,"Good, but Depressing","I enjoyed this book, though I found it altogether depressing. Yates writing felt like F. Scott Fitzgerald in many parts."
3,Decent Book,"This was the first book that I had to read for one of my college classes, and when I read the description I honestly thought it was going to be just another novel that all the girls would like that guys just wouldn't be able to get into. To my surprise, the novel actually ended up becoming interested in the story as I read, and wanted to finish the book (something I have rarely found when reading assigned books). It is a pretty depressing book, and while reading it I despised every character (except for one or two minor characters) for one thing or another. I think Yates' writing style is really what did it for me and helped make the book as good as it is. Overall, I wouldn't say that it is anywhere near one of my favorite books, but definitely something worth reading."
3,Character study,"I wouldn't call the storyline unique, particularly the ending, but it was worth the read. It was mainly just a sort of realistic look into the mediocrity of marriage as what one ""should"" do at a certain time in one's life. Frank was a completely unlikable character in my opinion, and April wasn't that much better, but I think that made the novel more realistic in a way, that this is what becomes of people who follow pressures rather than seek out their own path. I can't imagine reading this book and thinking I'd like to make it into a movie, so I'm anxious to see how they adapted it for the screen."
5,The tragedy of mediocrity,"This book is an absolute masterpiece, it explores the tragedy of not doing something outstanding with your life when you feel that you are called to do something more. I would recommend this for anyone who is feeling that they need to change something in their lives - this book will inspire you to take the chance and do the thing that seems inpossible."
3,Tedious at times but very well written,"Like a lot of other reviewers I was ready to quit this book until about the second part. I hate walking away from books I've started so I hung in there and I'm glad I did. This book really does get ah... boring. The best thing about it is how well written it is, it is really poetic in a lot of ways. I think the author here was trying to drag out how this couple was allowing themselves to feel emotions that a lot of people are too guilty to admit to. The ending was actually pretty depressing but fitting I suppose. The best part was when he was walking through the house and he heard her talking to him, I can relate.Boring at times but so well written... worth reading."
4,Character studies in surburbia,"Frank and April Wheeler on the outside are the ""perfect couple"" living in suburban Connecticut with their two children. Behind closed doors, though, April is a failed actress (that she is played in the film version by the terrific Kate Winslet is ironic) and Frank endures the drudgery of a 9-to-5 job. Planning to move to Paris and fulfill their expectations of greatness, Frank and April's shared life shatters with revelations of infidelity and broken promises. A lot of people pretend to be something they're not; this isn't new, but Richard Yates brings a fresh look to 1950s hopefulness and optimism in his dark look at marriage and coupledom."
4,Picket Fences,"Yates does an excellent job of depicting the idyllic suburban couple: husband, wife, and two kids. Revolutionary Road masterfully captures the tensions of marriage, the disparities between wanting to say something and what is actually said, and the escalating hpes and dreams that seem perfectly tangible and then wither away. While some of the plot, particularly toward the end, seems slightly formulaic, the overall novel is nothing short of a masterpiece."
3,Thought-provoking and quite disturbing,"Wow. This is some book. At the end of it, I was left with a feeling of both shock and slight queasiness. Yates's uncanny ability to show the disintegration of a doomed marriage will continue to resonate with the reader long after the final page is turned. Definitely not a light read. I mean, every married person in this book is absolutely miserable, and suburbia is depicted as some sort of cultural and moral wasteland. If you would like to remain happy, i suggest picking another book."
3,I must have missed something...,"I am familiar with the spectacular rave reviews this book has garnered, but I felt the characterizations were cold and univiting...I guess I missed the rave review boat on this one."
3,Would have liked to see growth in the characters,"This book is certainly well written, full of clever phrasing and insightful analogies however I grew weary of the characters. The characters were trapped and stayed trapped thoughout the long novel. I wish at least one had learned from mistakes. The characters did not seem destined to live a life of unhappiness which would have been tragic. Rather they were determined to be unhappy. I found the book dreary."
3,"Self Centerd, selfish","I am now anxious to see the film as this was one bizarre couple and I really need to seem them in motion. As a mom, it hurt me that they hardly regarded their children at all and seemed to have them strictly as fixtures that every suburban home must have. They were both wounded in their own way and brought these wounds into their marriage leading them into a downward spiral of destruction. I did have to chuckle at the amount of drinking that went on. Hardly a page was turned without me feeling intoxicated at the number of drinks being consumed by most all of the characters. John, the ""mentally ill"" son of their neighbor had the most profound line as he pointed to the expectant wife and said ""I wouldn't want to be that child"". No kidding!"
1,First book I didn't finish,"may be beautifully written, but it didn't drag me in at any point I didn't particularly care about the characters which made it altogether boring"
4,Revolutionary Road,"The book condition is clean and pristine, as the seller promised. The standard shipping came in the early part of the ststed delivery window. Only factor that surprised me is the small size (4"" by 5"") of the paperback instead of the larger format (5.5"" by 8"") paperback. Would like to see this fact revealed in book information."
4,"grim, dark, gripping","Richard Yates' did not believe in the resiliency of the human spirit, and Revolutionary Road bears this out; Yates has some sympathy for his characters, but this does not prevent him from piling petty horror after petty horror upon them. Yates seems to say at the outset: these are the terms for life, and there is nothing you can do to surmount them; nothing in American works anymore and there is no way to gain a sense of authenticity or regenerate the self. Yates' world is Calvinistic without the religion. So, this novel is a grim catalog of redundant failure. The prose is precise and oddly dispassionate, so there is the impulse to keep turning the page, perhaps to see what horror will occur next. Revolutionary Road is a curious novel with a dark vision which most readers would never wish to possess."
5,Revolutionary Novel,"Devestating drama of marriage going bad in the suburbs, years before Updike and Cheever got to the same level of social criticism. The book is also bracingly satirical, which can be off-putting at times. This book is considered a ""writer's book,"" because so many famous writers cite it as an inspiration, but the book is not all that elegantly written; instead, it has a creeping narrative power that surprises even the most jaded reader, and the final chapter, after the death of one of the major characters, is shocking for the casual cruelty and selfishness of the other characters. It's easy to see how Yates was ahead of his time."
5,A classic!,"I bought this book after hearing a review of it on NPR. I found the writing very insightful and feel that, in spite of it being set in 1955, it resonates with suburban life today. It is very powerful and is highly recommended."
3,Not a great read.,"The book is well written. The story is a downer- leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth. This is not one of your feel good stories. In fact, I am rather sorry I read it.Does one want to be reminded of how easy it is to fail at life?"
4,A Moving Portrait of Marriage and Family,"From the very beginning, this book drew me in. As I turned the first few pages, I could tell that something almost sinister was happening and I had to keep reading. April and Frank Wheeler appear as though they are a model couple, bright, ambitious in love, perfect family, but something is amiss. They feel as though they are better than their suburban neighbors and that fame and fortune are just around the corner. Neither part of this couple is happy with the choices he or she has made. April never wanted to be a housewife and mother; she never learned to like herself, so how can she possibly like anyone else? Frank is a chauvanistic pig of a man that plots out every part of his life, so he can fulfill his needs. This is a book about two people that thought they were better than everyone else and then slowly figured out that they were not.Not a word was out of place in this book. It is as relevant today as it was almost 50 years ago. Highly reccommended."
5,Forever: A Real Afterlife Thriller!,"Some books kill off the main character at the end of the story, but in Forever: A Godyssey Adventure... the main character is murdered by an unusual assassin - Agents of Hell!Forever will keep you on the edge of your seat as you experience death, transition and explore the domains of Heaven, Hell and a really cool Perry Mason type Judgment Day trial! The descriptions of both places are vivid and captivating!Forever keeps readers thinking about the here and now and what lies just beyond the grave barrier! It's got drama, horror, humor, hope, action, adventure! And for the guys... there's some really cool sword scenes, too! It reads like a movie! -Enjoy!"
3,The Big Day,"FLOWER GIRL BUTTERFLIES tells all about Sarah's preparations to be a flower girl in her Aunt Robin's wedding. She picks out her dress, prepares for visiting family, and attends the wedding rehearsal. Throughout all of these experiences she shares her feelings, at times she is excited and at others she is very nervous. When the big day arrives will she be ready?Little girls in particular are sure to enjoy this book. The illustrations for the story are absolutely beautiful and really complement the story well. I also enjoyed the fact that Sarah shared her feelings; she described what she was feeling and then labeled it. This modeling is an excellent way for young readers to learn to identify and label their own feelings. However, there was no build up in anticipation of the big wedding day and as a result, the story lacks excitement and read more like a ""to do"" list for flower girls at times.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
3,"Awesome book, but","This is a great book for a flower girl! I bought this for mine and she enjoys it! Her parents said she didn't put it down when she first received it! The book itself is awesome, great pictures and a nice story line. However, the condition I received it in was not so great. The description said, ""Like New."" This book was very worn with a sticker and writing on the inside. I have no idea why the seller thought this book was ""like new!"" I spruced it up as much as I could, but I was totally not pleased with its condition."
4,Beautiful labor of love (4 1/2 stars),"This wonderful DVD may not have IMAX-calibre imagery, but it shows a greater number and variety of whales than any other video I have seen, and sticks to whale-watching without sidebars or cut-aways.It is professionally produced and not hand-held home movies. Most of the video is amazing, tho some underwater scenes are grainy. It is also more personal and educational than many videos, and I appreciate that the narrative is done while viewing the whales, without cutting away to animation or extended science lessons.Captain Dave and crew clearly love their subject matter, and marvel at them along with us!"
2,Mediocre,I wouldn't use this as my main framing square cause of the lack of visiblity of the numbers.
2,Not very impressed with Simply Accounting Basic,"I was hoping I'd like this more than the corporate bookkeeping system I currently use. We have an acccountant, but like to keep track of the day to day books and cash flow. I was hoping this would be a little easier on us (two of us handle bookkeeping and neither of us have a background in finance or accounting).But I was really unimpressed. The templates aren't much of a help for our kind of business and there's not even a check register in the program!Support is also pretty lousy. I know -- what can you expect for under $50, but I expected a flippin' check register at least!While we will give this another try, I am more than likely going to go back to our old program and chalk this up to an unsuccessful adventure in our search for a good small business bookkeeping package."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I adore Juan Diego Flórez's voice. I think it is one of the most remarkable instruments that has come along in the past decade or so. I think the first two albums play to his strengths and are fine displays. I was just somewhat disappointed with this album. Overall, to me, the program for this disc is on the boring side and I feel unable to latch on to any of the characters he is attempting to portray. Instead, it seems like each piece is being tossed off with overdone production and power, without detail. Of course, this wasn't the intention, and I think JDF and the orchestra and Maestro Rizzi are at the top of their fields in regard to artistry, but I'm afraid this album and program don't display those strengths best."
5,Great Album,Great acoustic-soul album...it has a really nice groove to it. This is one of those rare albums that you can listen to over and over and never get tired of. I have tickets to see the band in November...I can't wait!
4,More Good Retro Style,"If you've been around for a while, these songs sound slightly familiar to 1970's combination of rock, blues, and soul music. But that shouldn't detract you too much from giving this CD a few good listens, before you make up your mind about it's quality. After all, good music is still good music, and sometimes going back in time is a good thing."
3,Pretty good,"I wanted to review this at 3 1/2 stars but it didn't work. My favorite songs are Having Wings, Lonesome Train and Younger Than Today. I always like Ben's prettier songs more than the rocking blues songs.Unfortunately Ben's voice is too loud on the title track Lifeline which drowns out the guitar part. It's also a bit too loud on the first song Fight Outta You. I think he produced it himself which might explain these obvious mistakes."
1,Get your apples from a tree,"The jar of Polar Fuji apples I purchased, while aesthetically pleasing, was of low quality. The product was consumed 6/7/2007 and had a ""best if consumed by"" date of 11/23/2008. The taste was reminiscent of the low-budget fruit cocktail we used to get in grade school in the midwest. The Fuji apples had the texture, consistency and mouth feel of unripe pears, and had little or no ""fresh apple"" flavor. Mostly, everything tasted just like the syrup, which sure as daylights wasn't ""Fuji apple juice"" or I'm Johnny Appleseed.Why would anyone eat canned apples anyway when relatively fresh apples are available throughout the United States? All I got out of this purchase was a little decorator jar with fake handles.I may plant an apple seed in it."
5,O'Brian - the Master of Naval Historical Fiction,"Having read all the Aubrey / Maturin novels by O'Brian at least three times, I am never tired of them. The dialogue between the principle characters is so compelling I really slow down my reading to absorb it all.I really must keep a copy of the Complete Oxford Dictionary by me in future as there are many old English words (particularly the seafaring ones) I haven't a clue what they mean and in the past I have just breezed over them. (excuse the pun about ""breeze"".)Recommended reading for all ""sea dogs""; but start at the first novel not like me who started with the ""Reverse of the Medal"" back in 1992."
5,"""Off hats"" to Patrick O'Brian!","It says something of the power of this series that I've been lately glancing through ads for sailboats, and I live in Montana. Ha - perhaps in retirement, eh?Without giving away any point of plot, I must say that the scene with the pillory had me in tears. Rumor has it that it is this book of the series that they are looking to next adapt into a film, and I couldn't help imagining how it might be depicted on screen.Needless to say, I loved this book and the series as a whole. It is my personal choice, had I to choose one collection, for reading on my desert island."
2,Iffy Movie at best.,"Seemed like it was probably early in Yuen Baio's career. The fighting was very slow paced and measured... The story was pretty decent I guess, but the acting was really bad. That being said, the story really isn't capable of driving this movie. If you put the fights in fast forward it's a good watch."
4,Good book,I enjoyed reading this book which gave some insight as to what a tank crew experienced during WWll. The only fault I found was the author inaccurately mentioned in the first sentence that the Battle of the Bulge was fought in France which makes one wonder what other inaccuracies will be encountered. I would have liked a book that was about a longer time span than six weeks. Overall it was worth reading.
4,"Not the typical polished war book, but a good fast read.","The writing style isn't that of a polished author, so at first you aren't sure if you will want to read a whole book written like that, but then you find yourself hooked on the author's thoughtful discussion of the day to day battles of his tank group. Interesting insight into the last months of the war. Skeptical at first, i ended up really enjoying this fast read of a WWII book."
1,This does not fit a Mercedes Benz C280,This part came up on a search for a 2006 Mercedes Benz C280. I ordered the part and was very disappointed because it was much to large and had to be returned. I called Gibson Racing directly to order the correct part and they informed me they do not carry any exhaust tips for a MB C280. So don't get your hopes up like I did and purchase this item..it will not fit.
2,Sweet Johnny Depp,I don't think it's fair when people write biographies about actors and whatnot. They portray Johnny Depp to be an evil person or some sort of crazy killer or something. He really seems like a sweet guy and who cares if he's made mistakes. Haven't we all? I'd just say... stick to his amazing movies and don't read exploiting books like this one. Also... whoever said his eyes look evil... they need to be put on medication. He has the BEST eyes ever. They're mesmerizing and gorgeous!
5,Dine and drink well in Argentina with this guide,"This colorfully illustrated book provides mouthwatering details of Argentine cuisine, going well beyond the basics of beef, mate and Malbec.One of my favorite ways to immerse myself in another culture is to eat and drink as the locals do. It's easy with this comprehensive guide. Use its A-Z Guide to translate restaurant menus.The book is well organized, easy to navigate and conviently sized for travel; it fits into your purse or pocket."
1,Not for tourists or residents,I wasted my money and the space in my suitcase buying this book. It is more a spanish-english dictionary. The mayority of the book consists of a long list of spanish words with its meaning in english (ocassionally followed by a brief description and illustration).Not recommended if:1) you are spanish speaker2) you are looking for a dinning guide or something similar.You will do better by buying a local guide in Buenos Aires
2,How can you write about the past without knowing the present,"If you would write a book about economics would you visit your local bank manager to get all the background information? Would you think that it is sufficient to read your way through some archives? Probably not.But this is what Rocco does to malaria. Rocco visits her childhood doctor in Kenya and spends a lot of time in archives to write about quinine. This may well be the safest and perhaps also the most comfortable approach to find the material for a book. And it could work for any subject, pianos in Berlin or cheese in Italy. Unfortunately what emerges is not a contemporary picture of the treatment of malaria or the history of malaria treatment but a rather skewed view on a historic niche. How can you try to understand the past if you don't know the present? If you care about some historical particularities, which pope had what malaria problem, written in beautiful English this is your book."
2,"Great Company, Stinky Product","I've been using Tom's of Maine products for several years now and am usually very pleased with them, especially since they don't include or experiment on animals. However, this is one natural deodorant I don't plan on buying ever again. For starters, I made the mistake of not reading the label very carefully: it's just a deodorant, *not* an anti-perspirant. So if you sweat, everybody'll know. Plus, it may say Unscented on the label, but P-U! If you like coriander, then you might like this deodorant; but I'd recommend trying any of ToM's other deodorant/anti-perspirant products instead and save your sense of smell, as well as those around you.Ingredients: Propylene Glycol, Chamomile Tea, Sodium Sterate, Witch Hazel, Aloe Vera, Lichen Extract, Glyceryl Monolaurate, Coriander Oil."
2,Doesn't do the job...,I was looking forward to using a natural deodorant (too many creepy ingredients in standard ones) but this just doesn't work for me. Whenever I use it I have to re-apply 2-3 more times throughout the day and I STILL end up smelling terrible. I don't do any kind of super labor intensive job that causes me to sweat excessively or anything like that and I don't have this smell problem with standard deodorants. Pretty disappointing.
3,Tom of Maine Lavender Deodorant Stick,"I bought this product in December when I was 8 months pregnant because the aluminum in regular deodorant was causing my skin to darken. Tom of Maine lavender deodorant is aluminum free and does not build up on my skin. It's easily washed off and smells nice. Sadly, it does not last 24 hours. After a couple of hours, I start to stink. If it's seventy degrees out, it lasts about thirty minutes to a hour before I start to stink. If you are going to use this product carry it around with you, be prepared to reapply, and possibly wash your underarms with some facial cleansing towelettes."
1,OUCH! BURNING! PEELING!,"We ordered a batch of Tom's deodorant from amazon and are returning it as quickly as we can. After using it for about a week, my partner's armpits and mine are red and peeling and itchy and burning. OUCH! i read that zinc ricinoleate is likely to blame. Neither of us have particularly sensitive skin, so I think this deodorant would affect others the same way...you've been warned..."
1,Makes Your Skin Break Out in a Rash,"I'm glad to learn I'm not the only one: this lemongrass crap put a dark red circular rash around each of my hair arm pits, kind of like a freaky red raccoon look! I was luckier than some other Amazon reviewers in that I didn't experience any pain, but, boy! I was surprised at how this lemongrass crap reacts on my skin.I really love Tom of Maine's long-lasting deodorant. It is long-lasting and it is aluminum free. And I've had great results from its calendula brand. But, oh boy! This product has to be terminated."
1,Worst deodorant I've ever tried,"I saw. I bought. I hated!This has got to be the worst deodorant on the market. It claims to be ""long-lasting,"" however, it didn't even make it 12 hours.I applied it right after I got out of the shower then went to work. Within a few hours I noticed my armpits felt sticky. I spend all day typing at a computer, so I know it wasn't from exertion. When I returned home, less than 10 hours after applying Tom's, I sniffed my underarms. Big mistake! They reeked! This may be ""natural"" for others, but not for me. I'd rather not be so ""green,"" especially if it means I'm going to have body odor."
1,Natural Deodorant - For That Natural Odor,"I can't see any effect from this product at all. It does not seem to combat BO in any way - if anything, it increases it. It should be called ""Tom of Maine's Natural Smell Like Barry Bonds's Jockstrap Stick""."
1,Don't waste your $,"I have been using a product called Naturally Fresh which is made up of mineral salts. It works quite well, but I thought I would try Tom's. I am quite sure that if I used no deodorant at all the results would be the same."
1,"Smell like s***, makes you smell like s***","It smelly, like a piece of s***. Then you will smell like s***. Stay away. I bought Old Spice Swagger."
3,good product,Toms has some fragrance but the Lemongrass deodorant from Mason Terre in Little Rock is much better. Of course it costs more. My husband thinks it is worth the extra $$$.
1,What happened to Tom's??? I GOT A RASH WITH THIS STUFF,"I used Tom's of Maine stuff until it was purchased by Colgate. The changes to the toothpaste was too much, so stopped using it altogether. I figured, the ingredients on the deodorant seem pretty harmless and natural; what could go wrong? Well, after about a month to two months of usage, I go to apply it and my wife asks, ""what's up with your armpit""? I look in the mirror and immediately utter, WTF??!!! Both pits are discolored!!! There hasn't been any itching or anything, just discoloration. Well, suffice it to say I threw away the tube I was using as well as a new one sitting in the medicine cabinet. Anyone else notice this? What has Colgate added that isn't on the label?"
1,Works for 1 minute,I really wanted this to work because I want to stop using secrets clinical deoderant. I tried Tom's Lavender deoderant last night and this morning my armpits smell like I never put deoderant on. And I barely sweat. Its a darn shame.Application - the deoderant was sticky when you apply it and it smelled like lavenderWhy is it so hard to make an organic product that works?I give this 1 star for the effort to create a non toxic deoderant.
4,Best Unscented Aluminum Free Deodorant,"This is the best unscented, aluminum free deodorant that I can find. Please note that it is not an antiperspirant and will not keep you from sweating, but will control the odor when you do. I have multi chemical sensitivity and have had aluminum poisoning, so I needed to find an unscented product that was aluminum free. This was a good fit."
1,Help! My armpits are falling off!,"I've been using the unscented regular version of this deodorant and have been pleased with the results.So, naturally I picked up a stick of the new long lasting lavender version expecting the same or better.Just one day after using this deodorant, my armpit skin felt like it was on FIRE! The skin was red, raised and angry looking.I did a Google search to see if anyone else had experienced this problem and behold there are hundreds of people in the same boat as me with burning and redness after using the new long lasting formula.Fortunately for me, a few days of hydrocortisone cream and it went away. Other peoplehave described peeling skin and long term skin discoloration.DON'T BUY THIS!"
1,"Do not use this... discomfort, irritation, and burning.","This is a horrible product. As you can see with the many negative reviews, this causes major skin irritation. My pits are red, peeling, and inflamed... plus, it doesn't even work!!! Do not waste your money or your poor armpits skin!!"
1,Beware!,"My armpits are red, peeling, and painfully irritated. I googled this problem and noticed that many people attributed these symptoms to this particular deodorant... which is what I've been using. Thank you, Amazon, for putting these reviews in a convenient place. As for you, Tom's of Maine, I'm putting you on notice. (Please continue making excellent toothpastes, though.)"
1,Poor product for sensitive skin,"First of all, this deoderant is not long-lasting. I had to constantly reapply it. Second of all, it made my armpits red and incredibly itchy."
5,Great all natural product,Love Tom's Of Maine products and have used theirr toothpastes for years. This has been a wonderful substitute since I found out that the mineral stone I had been using contained Aluminum Chlorhydrate. This works at eliminating odor for up to 10 hours (my experience) and this is while working in a pediatric OR (85-90 degrees somedays).
1,Allergic reaction,"I chose this product because it had such a pleasant smell, and was advertised to be ""long acting"" which is a problem I've had with other natural deodorants - they don't last more than 2 hours before you have to wash off and re-apply, or you start to smell. Well, I used this product for 2-days. I noticed some slight tingling on the first day. But on the second morning when I put it on, within 2 hours it started to burn and sting and my underam skin turned red! That was yesterday, and the skin is now peeling off, just like a burn! Even after I washed it off, the stinging and burning continued, so much that it kept me awake last night. I have since just been putting aloe on my armpits to help them heal, but I can never use this product again. I have never had this problem with any other deodorant before."
1,Are you serious? Super Glue under your arms,"Maybe I got a bad stick but this was like putting super glue under my arms, YUCK! Very uncomfortable. I had to wash it off within minutes of putting it on so I have no idea if it controlled odors."
5,For children and adults alike . . .,"I discovered this book at 31 years of age and it help me deal with my inconsolable grief better than any book I was able to find. To this day I buy it for friends young and old who are dealing with the loss of a loved one. They all love it and have thought enough of it to even tell me they re-gifted it to others suffering on some occasions.As to the folks giving this a bad rating for A) being ""depressing"" (are you serious? -- it's a book about dealing with GRIEF over death!) B) not constricting itself to your personal religious beliefs (the EMOTION of grief transcends constraints of any faith) C) not being appropriate for an ailing child (sorry -- this book was certainly not written to help your child navigate a serious illness) -- there may be other more personally appropriate books for you somewhere.In the case of this reader, and obviously many others, this book was the necessary balm we were seeking."
5,Memorable 18 years later,"My dad died when I was 5 (18 years ago), and this was one of the many books I read or had read to me for years after. This is the one that I remember the best. It was a story that helped me look at the whole situation differently, and it helped me be less angry about what had happened. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has children dealing with death and dying. Coming from a former child in that situation, it was a great book and I still remember it to this day."
4,I was widowed at 41...,"And I read this book four months after my husband died.I was going to my best friend's daughter's funeral because she had died during childbirth. Someone in the car had this book and I read it, I felt peace immediately. I can't count how many times I have bought this book for myself but ended up giving it to someone in need. I would keep two or three on hand and still gave them away. Finally someone gave ME a copy, and they wrote in it so that I had my own copy and I wouldn't give this one away. That made it even more special. A book that perfectly explains life from the cradle to the grave, sensitive and calmly."
5,Fabulous,"I love this book. I did a lot of research before purchasing several books for my neices and nephew after their grandpa died at age 62. It is a simple, well written and wonderful book for both children and adults to understand the cycle of life. I'm glad I chose this one."
3,Has good points,Has some good analogies but not from a Christian perspecitve. Will be good to use with adults to help provide further guidance and information.
4,Book purchase,"I ordered the book, ""The Fall of Freddie the Leaf"". It arrived as described and in record time. I have no complaints."
3,illustrations,"Freddy The Leaf is a wonderful story, and we were glad to find this new edition. We were disappointed to discover photographs rather than illustrations, though."
1,Depressing!,"Someone gave this book to my son when a distant relative died and he was about 7 years old. I found it cold and depressing. Even though my son wasn't very upset by the death in the family he became afraid of death after reading this book. I regretted that I trusted the person who gave it and didn't read it first. Spoiler alert: Freddie is terrified of dying, eventually he is ripped from the tree by a bitter cold wind to the snowy ground, feels peaceful, and rots to eventually support the growth of the tree in spring. There has to be better secular explanation of death for kids than corpse as fertilizer."
2,Freddie the Fallen Leaf,The copy was from a library and quite worn. That's about all I have to say. I'm still happy to have it.
3,"Very, very short","I was asked to find an ""inspirational"" book for our book club. I was surprised to find it is only a 10 minute read!Good message, but not a good book club book!"
1,CAUTION: PLEASE READ THIS BOOK BEFORE READING TO A CHILD!,"Sadly I did not, having what turned out to be a misplaced confidence in the incredibly good ratings this book has. I am still at a loss to understand how so many people could have it so 'wrong'!With hindsight, I have now read the least favourable reviews and agree with every single one.I read this to my four and half year old grandson who I had only just met, he was sleeping over, 500 miles from home in a strange bed - I can only hope I haven't left him traumatised! How I wish I had read it first!This book brooches a delicate subject that needs to be handled sensitively and with knowledge of the child likely understanding.(I just hope Dylan will forgive me one day!)"
5,The Fall of Freddie the leaf,"THis is an EXCELLENT book! It simply explains the life cycle in a non-threatening way. The birth of a leaf in early spring, followed by the growth, and eventual transformation in fall. It addresses the reason for being. It shows many positives and contributions that you can have in life. Simple but important contributions. This book softly and matter of factly addresses the end of life. It has a calm and peaceful feel. What a tender approach to a difficult topic. It also introduces the cycle of life by approaching spring as a new beginning. Life is part of death. Death as part of life. BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN! Great to read to children of any age. Great book to begin to prepare children for eventual losses...even before they are expected."
5,comforting story,I read the jacket flap and was in tears before I was half way through. This is a great story for children or adults who have lost a loved one. A good comfort. The leaves of fall will give you a warm inner smile.
5,A vibrant analogy of meaning of life and death,"Buscaglia offers an insightful, gentle look, into the meaningof life and death. Through the eyes of naturehe brings light to the experience of growing old and dying.A must for every family library, Fall of Freddie the Leaf,eases the heartaches of death while offering hope for eternal life."
5,Russian America,"Superbly: researched, written, illustrated, edited and footnoted. Loaded with fascinating newly uncovered information about Baranov and Russian America. I highly recommend this book."
2,Lacks Academic Validity,"As a scholar of the beguines, I have become very familiar with the historiography on them. This book is not well researched and it lacks the sophistication necessary to give a satisfactory account of this group of women.If you want something more informative, try Walter Simons' City of Ladies or Amy Hollywood's books."
1,so bad,"I honestly don't understand how people are giving this product such great reviews. First of all the smell is unbearable. I put it on and immediately almost threw up from the terrible smell. Not even exaggerating. Secondly the finish is so cakey and harsh...maybe if you pour gallons of it on your face with a paintbrush it will look natural. However that's the other problem, there's not enough, the bottle is way too small.Seriously, the biggest ripoff ever. I'm better off using l'oreal tru match foundation. in fact it has better coverage than this. and matches just as well.Don't waste your money."
2,clogged my pores,"I loved the coverage, it was great, but unfortunately, I had to discontinue using it because it clogged my pores and I broke out."
4,peaceful background music to relax,"this CD is lovely, it is perfect background music to relax to, or to listen to when you are having guests. I enjoyed it much."
5,The best book re: who's who and where of publishing,"I always recommend this book to every author or literary professional who doesn't own it already. I find it invaluable in running my literary agency, can't imagine NOT owning it. Julie Hill, Literary Agent and Book Publicist"
5,Best bookever about the real history and meaning of Reggae.,"Bloody brilliant. Chang and Chen know their stuff and give an indigenous overview of all the long and winding roads that reggae has travelled to become one of the most exciting popular music forms of the late 20th century, and being Jamaicans themselves are able to explore many of the less well travelled routes that many outsiders are unaware of. A real treat. Great to dip into. Keep it on your bedside table or in the loo. Good looking book too, well designed and lots of pictures."
5,Inspirational for sewers and designers of Wearable Art!,"Dress in Detail from around the world is one of the most inspirational books I have purchased. It expands your paradigm for designing your own patterns using the line drawings of these costumes. The embellishments, closures and use of multiple fabric combos is endless. The designs are simple and yet elegant depending on your choice in fabric. I feel they are adaptable to many figure types. I loved the focus of detail on necklines and cuffs as well as closures!"
2,Beautiful but did not meet my needs.,I returned this book to Amazon because it did not meet my needs. Each garment portrayed in this book is portrayed in the same way. There are 2 graphics for each garment portrayed. One is a detailed drawing of each complete garment and the other is a detailed or close-up photograph of a small portion of the garment. My problem is that there were no complete photographs of any of the garments. I was surprised the authors chose not to photograph any of the garments portrayed in their entirety. Not one! A drawing doesn't come close to a photograph. And a close-up photograph of only a portion of the garment is not enough as well. You need a complete photograph of the entire garment in order for the reader to get the proper feel for a garment.
1,Too skinny,"I ordered the 26"" Trico 17-260 Teflon Blade Refill along with the 22"" version for my 2008 Honda Odyssey. These were what was recommended by Amazon's auto parts look-up system. I have the OEM wiper blades. The length is correct but the width is not, so I sent them back. The Trico 17-260 and 17-220 are 1/4"" wide (actually about 9/32"") or 7 mm. What I need is 3/8"" or 9mm. It's too bad Trico doesn't put the width of their wiper refills on the on-line info or on the package. It is also too bad that the auto-parts look-up doesn't distinguish between the skinny and wide differences."
3,"Hey Honda owners, go see your dealer","I searched for about a week on-line and at car parts stores for a refill for my 2009 Honda Civic EX sedan wiper blades but like others have stated, while the length is okay, the width is usually not, so the fit is never quite right. Then I thought to check with the parts department of my local Honda dealer and they had ones that fit perfectly and work like a charm (and at only about $6 each, the price was surprisingly affordable). The refills are only the silicone portion so you do have to remove the metal supports from the old wiper and insert them into the new one but the whole process is easy and quick taking only a few minutes. For the DIFM (do it for me) crowd, I'd be surprised if the dealer wouldn't perform the replacement free of charge. Plus, you usually can't go wrong with OEM parts."
2,"Works, but makes squeaking noise","My old wiper blades started to leave a smear of water on the windshield after three years of use, so I needed replacements. The Amazon site provides only a few choices when I type in Prius, and this one sounds good from its description, so I got it. The edge of this blade was rough and it did not wipe clean at first, but after a few hours of break-in, it was fine. Then very much to my disappointment, it started to make a squeaking noise after two months of use, and it did not rain that much. It still wipes clean, but the noise is so annoying that I have to avoid using the wiper. It is going to be dry season in California, so I will be fine for a while, and I hope it will cure itself after 6 months or so when it rains again."
1,Not Compatible with 2006 Acura TSX,"When you search by vehicle, these refills come up. Please note that the 16"" refill will fit perfectly on the OEM wiper, but the profile on this 26"" refill is wrong. Before ordering, take the old refill out of your existing OEM wiper and compare with picture provided. You will see what I am talking about."
3,A little streaky,Your standard blade refill. The most difficult part was getting the original blade out. It seems to be a little streaky though.
2,Streaky and disappointing,"Got one of these for '07 Toyota Prius. Not pleased--streaky from the very start. Tried wiping it off repeatedly, but no improvement. Would not get this brand again."
2,ruined,"While this was a christmas gift for my father (as he and my entire family are huge fans of this album), I found myself extremely disappointed with the seller. When I received this cd, it was broken in the right bottom corner. I ended up replacing the whole thing. The c.d. itself is in excellent condition."
5,worth the money,"I purchased with Jumbo Zabuton Meditation Mat, Black and I am very pleased with quality of these products. I am 6 foot 2 inches tall and I find size is perfect for me. I can meditate much longer and easier than before."
2,"Too firm, your butt may go numb","I bought this cushion to start practicing meditation once again. I remembered from many years back that I had used a round thick cushion that helped me avoid my legs from getting numb. So this cushion looked similar and the reviews suggested that people thought it was comfortable. Unfortunately, the cushion is too firm. It feels like sitting on the floor with no mat. My butt has gone numb every time I tried using it. After reading a review that said you could take out some of the buckwheat to make it more comfortable, I adjusted it twice but still got the same numbing result. I'm returning this cushion and will look for some softer, thick option."
2,Not much new here.,"There is little that is new in this book; indeed, much of it is citation from Carpenter's biography and his edition of Tolkien's letters. The author seems focus a bit much on Tolkien's Catholicism; in fact, it becomes rather mind-numbing in the end, repeating the same thing in a different context. Mind you, I am not saying that Tolkien's religion did not influence his writings, but there were other things as well. I was looking forward to a new biography, but this was not the one I sought. The flaws in Carpenter's biography which Pearce and other reviewers on this page seem to dwell upon ought to be obvious to any of its serious readers anyway. I think one would be wiser to stick with Carpenter, the letters, and Tolkien's works. When it comes down to it, this biography relies too heavily upon block quotations from these, and, as a result, there was not enough new scholarship. The little that was present was a bit too narrow-minded for my taste."
2,Not much new here. . .,"I have been a devotee of Tolkien's works for nearly 20 years. As a theologian, I have long been interested in the philosophical/theological ramifications of the man and his work. I was hoping for much more than Mr. Pearce provided in this book. As I was reading it, I kept getting the feeling that I had read it before -- and much of it, I had, in Carpenter's biography and collection of letters. Frankly, in my opinion, far more material than was appropriate was culled from Carpenter for this to be considered a truly original work.Oh well! I guess if I want the definitive philosophical/theological work on Tolkien, I'll have to write it myself!"
4,Nice chair pads but don't grip too well,"I bought two sets of these when they were on sale for the Michael Scott Berkshire Road Ladder Chairs I bought on sale to make the chair seats more comfortable. These cushions were slightly too small for the chairs but I think once we sit on them enough they will flatten out and spread slightly. As far as staying put goes, however, the gripper bottoms don't do as well as some others I've had. I suppose I can do the velcro thing and that would fix the problem."
4,"Great paper, but...","This is an excellent set of paper, but it should be noted that the sheets are NOT 1 1/16 inch. They are 1 1/2 inch, which is a significant difference when you're dealing with things this small! I'll still be able to use them, and of course they can be trimmed down, but I was really hoping for not much over an inch square. The misinformation in the description is the only thing keeping this from being a 5-star review."
5,Perfect!,"They are the perfect size for a Senbazuru that doesn't take up lots of room. And the perfect shades of color. A little thinner than I anticipated but other than that, perfect. ^_^"
5,Excellent Resource for Group Therapy,"This book provides an excellent collection of activities that stimulate adolescent sex offenders to systematically examine the ways that they think, feel and behave and learn new ways of relating to others. It is an excellent offense-specific resource book in that it is tailored specifically to adolescent sex offenders and their unique needs. The book is well organized and has very useful activities which can be used in a variety of structured adolescent sex offender programs. The activities can assist the group in examining critical areas of treatment for this specialized population including victim empathy, thinking errors, and relapse prevention among others."
5,Love it,I bought this for my husband since he use to use it before but was unable to find it in the stores.
2,Doesn't last,The fragrance is nice but just doesn't last. You'll have to keep reapplying every hour or so. Not sure if I'll purchase again.
3,Halfway decent...,"Most of this footage is taken from a club performance in New Mexico supporting the Terrorist Threats CD. The picture quality ranges from excellent to lame depending on which angle they're filming from. It goes back & forth from an on-stage professional camera, which obviously presents excellent professional quality, but it then will at times switch to what it seems is maybe a fan-cam from the back of the venue, which presents a garbage view. The sound is generally good, but much of the show, they rhyme over top of their own recorded vocals, rather than the instrumental versions, which is kind of annoying. It's frequently spliced with interview footage, most of which isn't really all that interesting. Mack 10 is amusing though, as he goes into a very detailed discussion about various brands of white tee's, among other things. Basically, if you're a big fan of these dudes, then it's worth picking up. If you just like them a lil' bit, then don't bother."
4,Good,"if you know french buy it. It comes with the same info as it comes in English. of course, it talks about the objectifs of the new millenium, all I can I write is , we have to wait to see if that comes true."
2,Stopped working in 10 min or so...,"It's an awesome toy, but very poorly made. The forward and reverse motion stopped working as soon as the toy was taken out of the box. This is very strange, because the wheels kept turning while we were unscrewing the toy off the box holders (and would touch the buttons accidentally), but once the toy was put on the floor, it stopped moving after a few trial runs. The lights go on, the noise is deafening, the loader arm goes up and down, but the wheels are dead. New set of batteries failed to fix the problem. It appears that everyone has the same issue--very disappointing, because my child loves the toy."
4,tough toy,My son enjoyed this toy and played with it every day for a full week before he started playing with something else. So far it has held up well to his manhandling.
5,Satisfying on all counts,"This yarn keeps you guessing for a long time, which is what one hopes for in such a novel. The characters are well developed and unique, and the action proceeds at a rapid pace without sacrificing the detail needed to draw the reader into the scene. The writing is good enough to pose no distraction. For a first-timer, this author is remarkably skilled. Alfred Hitchcock would love this story line and its compelling McGuffin."
2,Overpriced. Bag is average quality and hard to wash.,I made more for this than for comparable items with more tips because I was under the impression that it was going to be of much better quality and that I was going to be able to reuse the bag many times.Well the quality is ok. Not any better than anything else I've tried and the bag is also just ok.At the price I was expecting more.
2,"Good songs, bad studio mastering.",I downloaded this album from Amazon's MP3 store. They would be great songs if the Quartet had gone to a decent recording studio. Certain songs are full of hiss' and clicks and certain notes end way too stiffly (reminds me of nails on chalkboard).Woulda been worth it otherwise. The songs have a great gothic feel to them. Very dark. But the poor mixing kills the deal.
2,Could have been much better,"I had expected to get more out of this. I like Apocalyptica, but this sucked."
1,this is how low I will sink to see Rutger,"Some of you will understand exactly what I'm talking about. The rest of you, I'd say don't bother watching this movie.I will watch ANYTHING with Rutger Hauer. (Other than that, I'm fairly normal.) Anything at all. Which explains why I sat through this creepy little B minus minus movie about legless, formaldehyde-swilling/flesh-eating mutants on a generic fishing island. (Supposed to be Maine, judging by the boat registrations, but apparently filmed in Canada- and God only knows what kind of accent those people were attempting. )Rutger, Rutger, Rutger. You are fast becoming Brandoesque in stature- and I don't refer to acting ability. You mumble and slur your words. You no longer get the girl. Yet I still see you as Etienne of Navarre, as Martin the swashbuckler- impossibly Aryan, the android more alive than real flesh. Sigh. Is there any hope for me??? Probably not, if I keep watching such awful movies just to get my fix."
3,Can't look Mom in the eyes anymore.,"While the plot lacks substance.. and the subject matter is just disturbing.... this film offers much in the realm of F/X. superbly done, especially considering the script they had to work with."
1,Yuck !,"Is it just me, or does anyone else notice that Rutger Hauer's career is winding into the abyss? I first saw him in a wonderful WWII movie called 'Soldier of Orange' then in 'Blade Runner', then he played a very convincing Albert Speer in 'Inside the Third Reich' and a convincingly creepy murderer in 'The Hitcher'...then his movie career just nose dived. One horrible...and I hesitate to call them...'B' movie after another he's made. What's up? What next? Rutger Hauer as Bozo the Clown? Barney's Next Great Adventure, co-starring Rutger Hauer as Barney's side kick Side Kick, 'cause Barney likes to kick me in the sides'...? Actually, that sounds better than this movie."
2,"Going, going, gone...","This movie had, what it seemed to be, an interesting plot going for it, for the first hour, and then.... Muppets! The film turns from a man haunted by a mysterious legacy, to muppets fighting villagers. Oh well, pass the popcorn."
2,Wierd...,"I originally bought because of Roy Dupuis. This is by far one of the oddest movies I've ever seen. I wish more time had been spent on John and 'Urs the Nurse' (an inside joke a friend and I came up with knowing that Kristen Lehman had previous been on 'Forever Knight' portraying Urs a vampire).This movie in fact inspired a group of Roy's fans to nickname him 'Vampire King' because this movie seems to be about an odd vampire-ish type of guy. Had the writer and director tried a more traditional vampire tale instead of focusing on the legless freak aspect, it may have been a better movie.However, as many have already mentioned, this is pure b-movie fodder.It's no 'Interview with the Vampire' or 'La Femme Nikita', but it you like Canadian productions and Roy Dupuis, it may be one to add to your shelf."
3,A bit better than average b-movie stuff,"This wasn't quite your average b-movie. The plot was fairly simplistic and obvious, which I had expected, but what made it more was the decent acting between the main characters, John and his wife. They were able to give their roles more depth than I would typically expect from a movie like this. I felt there was several other characters who were unusually detailed for this sort of movie--the ""odd"" girl, and an undertaker's daughter! Also, I enjoyed the natural settings,the island views--so often in films like this bad quality set design detracts from the film. The other thing I very much liked was that most of the characters were women, rather than the usual ""I'm fainting come and save me"" females in movies like this."
3,"A Really Messed-Up Film, But Totally Awesome As Well","This dvd is worth it just for the one scene where he eats a preserved fetus in a jar and then screws his wife for, like, ten solid minutes."
3,A strange mix,"This is a B movie that had the potential to rise above its place in the genre, but didn't quite make it. It's a blend of contemporary horror and gothic darkness. Despite its faults--some moderately bad acting by secondaries, some clumsy dialogue and a few glaring continuity errors, it's very watchable. As long as you don't mind nudity, incest, and cannibalism. Roy Dupuis and Kristin Lehman save it from being pure shlock. It also has going for it a very beautiful, moody musical score that deserves its own CD."
5,Great dvd...,"My boyfriend always talks about the Huevos movies and I had never seen one....I got it for him for Christmas. It was really good, I am glad I finally got a chance to watch it....Not only does it feature some pretty cool freestyle stuff, but it also includes some GNCC woods racing, which my boyfriend does. It was nice to see some of the woods racing that I don't get to see...."
2,gets the job done,"This works well enough. The power and usb cables are always coming loose from the drive, so everything has to be propped in place before using it. It works well for loading programs in a laptop without a disk drive, but you wouldn't really want to watch movies with it."
4,My product review,I am satisfied with your product. It is flat and compact in size and it fits in my labtop protective bag together with the rest of the accessories.Yet I feel there is room for the price to be more consumer friendly.
4,"Shade Tree Mechanics of the World, Unite!","Fortunately politics are left behind to take an endearing look at thearmy of homegrown chewing gum and baling wire engineers that keeps Cubarolling. Meet the artisans who use chain link fence for welding rods,and and can refit your cherry Studebaker woody with a Soviet tractorengine. Suspended between old-fashioned Communism and Yankee freedomand capitalism, a unique culture not yet lost to Toyotaland.Recommended for any documentary fan who's ever been or aspired to be a shade treemechanic."
4,GOOD ROAN QUALITY,"These movies are issued by a myriad of companies. I only have this set so I can't comment on the comparative quality. I can state that I am satisfied with the quality of this Roan set. That is, the images are mostly crisp and there wasn't much hiss. The price is a plus also.I Liked ""Time of Your Life"" best. It has a good quirky cast and plot. The acting is also first rate. It has a certain stage play feel to it.""Blood On The Sun"" is a more than adequate suspense yarn.""Something to Sing About"" is a fun movie. Its kind of a comedy-musical-drama. Nothing too serious."
5,Beautiful Songs Accompanied by Nature,"Heart of Summer contains some of the most beautiful songs ever made by Solitudes. The music contained in this CD is perfect for relaxation or a pleasant evening when you lie down. The music helps in the retreat to a better state of mind and therefore, is extremely helpful for many purposes. If you listen to the samples, you will hear that the songs have more to give than just sweet sounds of nature."
4,Spies and Lies,"I was so impressed with the lively dialogue and clever plot in this book. I have high standards for Regencies and this book met every single one. The main characters are smart, exciting, and engaging, and the post-Napoleonic intrigue is believable, compelling, and touching. The heroine, an independent millowner from Yorkshire crosses swords and wits with a determined Frenchman, and together they attempt to trap a traitor. The relationship between the main characters is deliciously provocative and sweet at the same time. Read this book!"
4,PS/2 Port Needed,"I just got the keyboard yesterday so I can't fairly rate its performance - but Amazon doesn't list the specs, and though Circuit City's sister listing states ""Comes with AT connector and AT to PS/2 Adapter,"" the keyboard ONLY comes with a PS/2 input.No problem, it's still a good deal - just be aware that you either need an available PS/2 port or an AT adapter, which'll cost a few more dollars."
1,Don't Buy,It's a horrible piece of crap that broke after two weeks. Several of the buttons have stopped working and I'm not waiting around to see how long it'll take for the other keys to conk out.
5,Just What the Dentist Recommended,"My dentist recommends this toothpaste, but it is hard to get in my area, so an online purchase is perfect. The mint gel tastes pretty good and foams well, but not excessively during use."
1,Ouchie! Burns!,We usually buy the Original with no problems. Husband decided to try this variety and I used it once with little problem. I've used it again and brush my tongue with it too(using Sonicare). My tongue burns and is sore. I cannot recommend it.Going back to the Original.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this item because I moved to Alaska and it was the only toothpaste that I could subscribe through Amazon in my village. I was excited about it at first. Mouthwash and toothpaste in one! However, after using this product for about a week, I began getting blisters on the sides of my tongue, causing a great deal of grief. I had never had any sensitivity to any other toothpaste before. After I finally figured out this was the only thing new that I had been using, I had to get rid of almost the whole tube. I was very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it."
2,Dont waste the money,"I thought it would be better for the price, but honeslty if it was only $10, I would not buy it again.I have used this item faithfuly for several weeks, and have notice no noticable differece, and at times I feel my eyes burn and my vision is blurred.Very disapointed in this very expensive product!Would still like to know how safe this item is around the eyes?"
2,A well written book for beginners.,"The author writes very well, but all too often the advice is a little thin. I liked his approach to handling money but for real practical advice I found another book more useful: ""How To Invest $50 to $5,000"" by Dunnan. However, both make excellent presents for young and/or inexperienced investors and savers."
4,okay..,"I liked it, and it was helpful, except it wasn't geared to COMPLETE beginers who have had zero experience to investing... I would have liked there to be a section telling you exactly what all the numbers (like in a wall st. journal) mean, and how they relate to a company... The glossary was very thin..."
4,Intelligent advice for thoughtful investors.,"Lowell's writing voice is engaging, intelligent, and refreshingly free of finance jargon. This is a primer for people who have more on their minds than their mutual fund returns. One of the very few books of this genre I could actually relate to, as someone with a healthy skepticism towards the American dream of riches and retirement. Written uncondescendingly and with attention to the often ignored but important issues of investors' social responsibilities, and if it is in fact possible to do well and do good at the same time. One of the few books of this genre that doesn't alienate me."
2,Motorola W385 OEM charger,"You do get what you pay for. I've already thrown this out. Cord was way too short, and it failed to charge any of the multiple phones that use this charger."
1,not happy,very good customer service but bad product. Received 2 one works the other doesn't. Emailed company they sent out another right away. received that one in and only works when the cord is bent. So very bad quality control. Would not recommend product but would highly recommend Company selling it.
4,Miracles abound!,"Reading this book inspired me to leave India and make a bee-line for Mother Meera's darshan. I wasn't disappointed. Harvey's made a u-turn since; well, I guess that's his gig. This book's still worth a look. As for Meera, five years on and I'm still glad I made the trip; my life is definitely better for her presence in it."
1,"No. Dear god, just look at the title!","Yes, it starts off as a reasonably coherent book about a mentally troubled intellectual. Right when he begins to get 'spiritual', the book takes a nose dive into incoherent new age dribble that is sloppily put together. An example would be like this: ""Oh wow, I just had a spiritual awakening. A couple days later, another one. Wow."" Only it is less like a spiritual awakening and more like a psychological revelation about dealing with his wounded eros. This would be fine if it was presented in an exciting, sensible way, yet instead he chooses to drag the reader along on a tiresome journey into his own unconscious that yields less than a paragraph of Jung would in terms of profundity. What's more, he manages to make even less sense without any of Jung's complexity. It reminds me of so many movies put together in current times in which the plot is dull, full of holes and one is just relieved that it is over."
4,Hard to specify,"A lovely but, alas, incomplete selection of Spanish music, art and architecture. It was served up with gentle elegance. I loved it and now wish that I could find a disc about Spanish art and another about Spanish music.With the accents involved I wish subtitles had been available."
2,The Glory of Spain - Music and Masterpieces from Madrid's El Prado Museum,"I bought this as a ""filler"" or lesson for a sub if I needed something easy to prepare. I showed it to my Spanish 4 students recently and they rated it ""OK"" meaning it wasn't the worst thing in the world. I like the fact that they are introduced to Andrés Segovia. I have postcards of many of the works of art presented, so I can use those to enhance what they saw.I am not enamored of it, but will use it in case of emergency."
5,Track List,"DeGarmo & Key - Go To The Top / ForeFront / 1991 / /Track List:01. I Believe02. Go to the Top (At the Top Reprise)03. Against the Night04. Ultimate Ruler05. Soul Mender06. Family Reunion07. Still at Work08. Stand, Fight, Win09. Victory (March on Prelude)10. March on11. The Rest of My Life"
5,Big Fan!!,I have thoroughly enjoyed this music. It comes from a time in my life where I went through a dramatic spiritual change. This music provides the message of what happened to me as well as a reminder of who I am now. What a blessing it is to me!!
3,skate shoe,"One shoe works really well, the wheels open and close no problem.The other shoe the wheel opens fine but it takes a lot of playing around with it to close. If it wasn't so much for shipping I'd send it back for a replacement. For now I guess I'm stuck with them."
5,Rods fit like a glove.,"I've used spincast reels for over 40 years. This is the first time I have ever used them with a proper casting rod, & the butt of these rods really does fit in your hand like a glove. I'm looking forward to getting back to the basics, like when I was a kid, & flicking a few worms into the same holes in the river that I did donkey's years ago. I love the quality & the robustness of these rods. I know I won't ever put a scratch on them, & it will eventually be up to my future grandchildren to try to wear them out. I am relatively new to the ugly stik, but I have become addicted to them. I have updated most of my rods to ugly sticks, except for my spinning rods. These last 2 make 9, & I have 2 more on the way. Great, affordable rods,you can never have too many."
3,A Case is a A Case ... Kinda,"It does what it is designed to do so in that sense it's a 5-star case. Beyond that it's quite poorly designed. You shouldn't have to have a Ph.D in structral engineering to put a camera in a case. The button closure system here is ridiculously over engineered. You will actually have to practice putting your camera in this case.And as for taking it out quickly to get a shot ... well, good luck."
2,No answer key,"This book does not have any instructional information on how to do the exercises, it's for students that have already studied these types of problems and know what to do and it does not include an answer key, which is a disapointment! You have to purchase the teacher wrap around edition or Chapter Resource Masters for the answers, I can't even find one available to buy! I'm going to contact them."
3,It's an okay CD,This is an okay CD. It's very big and has a lot songs. My kids just don't like it very much. They have only listened to it because I asked them to. It does have educational songs though.
3,There's good and there's BAD!,"The price was great on this duo, I got both for the price of a mouse. That should have tipped me off...The keyboard is excellent, I've had other wireless keyboards and had all kinds of trouble, this one is fine so far. The design is OK and I like the features. The mouse is another story, it's design is a bit clumsy and it's very temperamental. The movement is fine, the scrollwheel is also OK, but the buttons only work when they feel like it! I've tried changing the wireless channel and sometimes it works, but not all the time. I sometimes have to click on something 5 or 6 times before it registers. I've found no help on their troubleshooter or support site either. Other times the mouse works great. Unless you are very patient and have alot of time on your hands I would steer clear of this duo. Buy the items separately this way you can just return one if it doesn't work properly."
4,Good,I love this my only problem is battery on mouse keeps saying low battery but the battery is still good. Overall it is good for the price.
2,"Keyboard good, mouse wheel does not work!","very happy with design and layout - but the mouse wheel does not work. I am able to use it as a third button but I cannot use it to scroll in MS Word or MS IExplorer. I have downloaded the latest dirvers (v5.3) and have checked the mouse config settings to make sure it is enabled - but no joy. I will re-install drivers one more time and then return it, which would be a shame as I do like the price/value."
3,It was just okay,Bought two as Christmas gifts one worked one did not. Sent it back no problem second one worked okay.I think that you will have a problem if you have to many wireless electronics near this.
2,Noisy and high-maintenance,"Definitely not a set-it-up-once-and-forget it. Constantly requires attention to make it work. The keyboard is very noisy, and the mouse is heavy. Cannot use the mouse on a slanting surface, because it will slide down due to its weight. There are better wireless ones that have come out recently. Features are good (bookmarks, shortcut keys, etc), but bad usability. I would never buy it again."
4,Overall Great Product,"I've had this keyboard/mouse combo since Feb 06 and I love it. I telecommute from home everyday so it gets a ton of use. I rarely have connectivity issues with the mouse as I've heard others describe. I love the features on the keyboard and I'm a huge hot key user so this has been great for me. I also love the design of the keys. As someone who has really tiny hands/fingers it has saved me from a lot of wrist and finger pain that I can get with regular keyboards. One thing to be aware of however, is if you are trying to network computers together at home, only very specific switches will work if you want to share this keyboard & mouse between computers (or any wireless combo for that matter). I purchased the MiniView 2 port USB KVM Switch GCS102U. It works like a charm."
1,Arrived squished,It lost its shape in transit and there is no way to get the star form back. Cheap as the price implies
1,The Magic Bullet Suppository (Box) Packs Per Box 100.,"I have been an Amazon.com customer for the last three years. I never had problems with my orders before except this last one. I received last April 1,2011 this order #105-8769763-.I am very dissappointed because the Suppositories have an Expiration Date of 4-11. How can you sell expired merchandise.I talk to Cathy of your Customer Service to give me an address where I can return the mechandise. Cathy was very gracious talking to me this morning. I ask her to give me the address where I can return this merchandise."
5,Excellent Professional Service,"The item was out of stock, but because I waited...they gave me a free box for FREE. Usually it's LIGHTENING FAST SHIPPING~!"
2,"Weak characters, shallow plot","The overall premise of this book was interesting - an ""artful"" murder mystery set in Tuscan Italy. Having visited Lucca myself, I was somewhat disppointed to find that relatively little of the flavor of the place came through in the book. Worse, the characters are shallow and stereotyped. The detective intuits his way through virtually every difficulty, using his mind reading powers to solve each problem. While a psychic detective may appeal to some, I find the concept not at all believable. The rest of the characters are poorly developed, shallow stereotypes and the dialogue is childish. The story had potential, but in the end, I would classify this book as ""fluff""."
5,A Must Read for College Athletes,This book does a great job of describing many of the obstacles faced by female athletes. It has greatly helped me redefine my athletic goals and understand what I may encounter as I continue my athletic pursuits.
3,Be careful that this doesn't make you start to hate men.,"... While it does have some valid points regarding sexism in sports and sexism of male athletes, it takes things a little far. Reading for any prolonged period tends to give one a very negative view of men in general and athletes in particular. In addition, the author underestimates the strength of women, and discounts the possibility that being viewed as a sex object can be both stimulating and empowering to them. Her depiction of cheerleaders and topless dancers, among other things, were very shallow. The whole book is very one-dimensional, and seems to be written by the kind of rabid feminist that gives feminism a bad name. Not everyone out there believes that all men conspire to bring women down and subjugate them."
1,Not Received Yet??,Hi away on holiday and have not received item as yet so cannot rate your product so at moment will score 1 star!!Not sure if item has been mis placed or lost in transit.ThanksRegardsRichard Percy
5,English Creek--a tale of sheep herding families and big sky country,"Anyone who has any interest in wonderful, descriptive, humerous, knock-your-socks off prose will love this book. I enjoy the time period in which the story is set, and reading about Scottish people who raise sheep in the remote NW corner of Montana is a great read for me. The style of writing is, to me, very eloquent and difficult to surpass. My only questionable feeling about this book is that it is recommended as the 2nd in the Montana trilogy and is set in a time period after Dancing at the Rascal Fair..I think that Dancing should be read first."
4,Very entertaining read...,"I hated to get sleepy at night, because I didn't want to put this book down. I thought this was a good story, and the author does a good job of describing the beautiful countryside to the reader."
2,Poor Character Development,"This is a sweet story about hard working men and women in the forests of Montana. The characters are all super achievers who suffer silently. They are not common people and are somewhat unbelieveable. The first half of the book moves too slowly. The number of characters just keeps growing. Instead of developing any of the characters properly, new characters are introduced. There are 50 characters in the first 60 pages and the author does not stop there. The climax of the story is a forest fire which is the most exciting part. I would never read the sequel to this story."
3,So-so novel of a Montana family,"Set in northern Montana in 1939, this novel tells the story of the McCaskill family. Young Jick is 15 and interested in learning his family's history--not easy since his parents are pretty tight-lipped. His older brother wants to get married rather than go to college, which causes a rift in the family. The father works for the Forest Service and in tackling a big fire at book's end provides Jick with important family history. Good in spots, especially the last 50 pages or so, but one gets the feeling in much of the book that Doig is trying hard to write an epic, only it comes across as only boring details."
2,Very Dull,I had to read this book for my college english class and it may in fact be the most boring book I have ever read. I am an avid reader and usually will read anything that I can get my hands on but I couldn't wait to end this stupid book and get on with my life. Every single one of my classmates hated it and unless you're a very cruel english teacher please don't make your poor students read this god forsaken book. I only gave it two stars because the last two pages were the only interesting ones out of the VERY long drawn out book!
5,Simply magical!,"Doig's characters are just incredible. His sense of humor is immense. His description of the depression years in Montana is fascinating. And of course, the landscapes inspired by his acquaintance with the countryside depicted in ENGLISH CREEK are breathtaking. This is the best book I have read in ages! I am going to find a way to work it into my American literature course, because it is not only a great book, it's a priceless piece of Americana."
1,Sudoku Puzzle Addict,Thumbs down. Didn't even finish the first game. It was so hung up on graphics that it forgot that the purpose was the game itself!
1,Cant give an honest review,I thought it was a book and the place I had it shipped to discarded it so I can't say.
5,"Believe it or not, this is a great one.","This is great for beginners, and experts. I happened to get this at a discount store (for dirt cheap). Well, it's the same old story. Some times the simple things are the best. The thing is, if you want the duplication alarm (the warning that you get when you have 2 of the same number in a row or block) on, you can have it on. If you want hint's, you got it. If you want puzzle solve, you got it. If you want to print it out, no problem. Design is good. But be warned, play it enough times, and you too will get addicted."
3,A Good Version for the Money,"This is a good Sudoku version, especially for beginners. The graphics are full-screen and beautiful. But, the numbers are italic style, and not large or dark enough to make them easier to see. The fixed starter numbers are red and the numbers to be filled in are gray. There are no sound effects at all. It's good that there is no repetitive background music, but it would be nice to have some sound effect at the correct completion of the puzzle -- a sort of ""ta-da!"" congratulation for a job well done."
2,letdown!!!,I needed a sudoku source generated without the internet (my employer's server blocks all sudoku puzzles!) The layout is marginal. The rows and columns are difficult to read.The easy puzzles are ok but the medium is too hard. They require notation which I associate with the 4 star or hard level.The game was cheap and it is better than nothing but there must be better products on the market.
4,must have for self driving travellers,great itinaries for loco-regional drivingquite detail maps and time suggestionsbest if include more long trips which cover some of everything
5,It will make you want to drive for hours and hours...,"This was one of my best purchases for our month-long Britain adventure so far. There are 25 different driving itineraries, each complete with maps, estimated times and miles, and sights to see along the way. The color photos helped us narrow down our choices to a reasonable number of drives. They show the terrain and some of the sights on each tour, so you can pick several different ones that offer unique views and places to see.If you are planning on renting a car and driving in Scotland, I would suggest combining this book with a full Scotland or Britain guidebook like ""Let's Go."" You will need full listings of places to stay, admission costs to castles and sights, and historical information about the area. Combine these two guides with a good road atlas (like AAA Britain atlas), and you'll have all of the information you need for the perfect trip."
5,Touring Scotland at its Best!,"If you're taking an independent tour of Scotland by car, this is the only guide you'll need. It has everything: road maps with explicit directions, stops along the way, history, shopping hints, hints for travelers with young children, places to stay. The list goes on and boggles the mind.This book doesn't treat you like a complete idiot--just someone who has never been to Scotland and could use a guide. It was my constant companion when my brother and I took my son to visit our ancestral homeland. It was so easy to find where we wanted to go and what we wanted to see. It gave us sample itineraries and expected travel times, something that comes in handy if you're on a time-limited holiday and want to get somewhere fast.I've given this book to two of my friends who are traveling to Scotland this year, and I intend to buy the newly up-dated version for my summer jaunt to the Highlands."
2,Didn't look at this one at all,"I really wasn't very impressed with the outline. I would recommend Scoland the Best and then the Eyewitness guide as a must if traveling to Scotland. It was not very specific, and the tours for the most part were too long. Most were 2 days, and we were in different places every other night which really didn't allow us to do what the tours suggest."
4,Comprehensive with one shortcoming,"Most of the trips were little loop trips that began and ended in various locations around Scotland. What I really needed was one loop route around Scotland for one week that included my desired destination cities: Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Perth, Aberdeen, Inverness, Drumnadrochit (Loch Ness) and Glasgow. So what I had to do on my own was to cobble together pieces of various stops out of the book to fit my planned itinerary and choice of hotel stops. Since I bought the Historic Scotland Pass I also tended to visit those sites more than others in the guide. These factors made this book more of a resource picking places to visit along the way than anything else. A future edition would benefit by including about three good circle routes around Scotland (beginning at one of the two major airport cities: Glasgow or Edinburgh) to help plan a one or a two week long vacation."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought this keyboard for a network server figuring that I would save a few bucks since it wouldn't be used much. There are, however, two main problems with it.1) The keyboard seems incompatible with any monitor A/B switches. I've tried several, but they all lock the keyboard up, which forces me to unplug the keyboard and plug it back in for it to work.2) The control and shift keys 'stick'. They aren't actually stuck down, but they often 'act' as if they're stuck. To cure it, I have to press both shift buttons or both control buttons.This keyboard, in my opinion, isn't worth the money for what I use it for and it'll be replaced as soon as possible."
3,Good value for the money,"This keyboard is a good value for the money. There are a few things I don't like about it. One being that the delete button and the power button are next ot each other is annoying and that you can't get this in any other color except ""putty"". But overall it works great for being under ($)."
2,You get what you pay for...,"First of all, I only got this thing so I could try out my schnazzy new computer. I simply couldn't wait to try out my new computer. But this keyboard is basically a waste of money and even if you are on a buget, you might consider spending more money on something that lasts. Otherwise, you be spending more money constantly replacing these things. This thing doesn't type certain keys after being used for thirty minutes or more. Eventually it won't type any key(like a while ago when I had to reboot) It is only three months old and is already old and warn out. I'm going to spend a little more and get something that lasts, like a Logitec keyboard.P. S. if anyone knows what the 'Fn' key is, mention it in your review. Just curious, thanks."
5,A great value,"If you're looking for a keyboard that is not one of the ergonomic or natural types, this one is perfect. The most important feature in any keyboard to me is the tactile response. They keyboard I replaced with this one was very ""crunchy,"" meaning you had to press the keys too hard and it made a loud click with every keypress. This one has a light and springy feel which is just right.It has all the extra windows keys if you happen to use them, and is dirt cheap."
3,Good for the price,"I wanted just a plain keyboard and that's what this is. Sure it doesn't have any web access buttons (for the lazy person) but it's durrable, the enter button is huge for those of you who need that sort of thing, and it's easy to clean.The only downside is that there are 3 extra buttons: Power, sleep and wake which it doesn't come with software for. Personally, they get in the way and I end up hitting one of those instead of the delete key or the up arrow most of the time."
5,Etheral Space,This is an excellent book creating suspense as our solar system passes through a poision belt in the cosmic web and explains beautifully the effects of a supposed poisen on our solar system. The Reader of this book will wonder that has Sir ever been an attendent of Dr. Einstein or Sir has himself teleported himself to the Deep Space and visualised the passing of 9 planets into etheral poisen.
5,The Best Musical in 10 Years!,This collection captures the best Broadway musical in ten years! You don't want to miss it and collectors will love the graphics and essays.
1,Great Expectations...Greater Disappointment,"I have listened to this cast recording twice and I wish I would have saved my money. With one or two exceptions, all the songs seem to sound the same. And I almost fell asleep listening to it the second time. Usually when you see a show or hear a cast recording, you end up humming or singing some of the songs because they are so good. I hate to say it, but there are no songs on this CD that are catchy or even likeable. Such a big disappointment. This CD is destined to attract much dust on the shelf.6 Months Later...listened to it again just to see if it got robbed of the Tony award for best musical. It did not. Most of the songs still sound the same to me, but I found myself appreciating the music more than the previous two times. Still, I think a show this big needed a more diverse score. I probably won't take this CD off the shelf for a long time."
5,Fast,The seller was fast in shipping my purchase. I received it with enough time for giving it as a gift to my fiance. I really appreciated the service.
3,GOOD IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE PLAY ON BROADWAY,"I saw the play in New York, and then purchased the soundtrack approximately 10 months after seeing it. There are some tracks that stand out for me more than others like ""Push Da Button"", ""Hell No"" and ""is there anything else I can do for you"", but overall this is a good CD."
1,Don't waste your money,"My dog loves every treat imaginable, and these he would not touch. I ended up throwing them out. Not a good product, and I would not recommend them."
5,Classic!,In my opinion this is some of Thomas Whitfield's best work! I bought this because I wanted to get back into the gospel I grew up with instead of the at times unrecognizable gospel of today. This album is classic and one of my favorite albums of all time!
3,Rest HOllow MYstery,Schneider Schneider I enjoyed this book.I don't know why you need more than that.I Had suspense and romance in of
5,Really good with lots of information.,"When my fiance got me this book I said, ""Hey who are you calling an idiot!"" But after I read it I realized that I was a total idiot! There is a lot I need to know about before getting married that I never knew about. It is all in this book too. There is a lot of information. I feel like now when I get married I know as much information as a person who has been married five times!!!"
5,Very informative and necessary for any ede small job to serious career.,"This is the most important book to own when working with Early childhood children. It covers a variety of problems and gives advice for them all. This is a must have for any job you have relating to young children whether it be kids camp worker, day care worker, preschool worker, or any type of teacher for early childhood education."
4,Good,"Probably wont use this item very much but I needed it for my Viper alarm for two holes to drill, one for the light and the other for the valet."
2,Look out! Reverses hot and neutral for US plugs,"I just got one of these. As a line splitter it's fine, splits a line as well as any other line splitter out there. I thought the funky universal socket was a pretty cool feature, and maybe it is: although the splitter only has a regular NEMA 5-15P (US) plug on the end, its socket will accept lots of different international plug shapes.Only I guess the international plug standards don't all put hot on the same side, and this splitter is actually wired so if you're using a standard US plug (yes, right, the kind that matches the one on the end of the splitter), you'll get your hot and neutral reversed!I wish I could have been in the room when the design team figured that out."
5,Great tool,This is great with a clamp meter and a DMM. You can test volts and amp at the same time. This is very easy to use just plug in what you want to test clamp the clamp meter and thats it. It also has places to put test leads to test the volts. Very Easy To Use.For anybody wondering why you would ever need one of these. Think about when an appliance flips a braker with this plug the appliance into the line splitter you can check the amps. Thats what thows the braker.
4,The best known Destroyer of WWII in the Pacific,"Named after an Ensign killed at Peal Harbour, the USS England was famous for sinking six Japanese submarines in less than two weeks in the Pacific during WWII. Over 500 of this class were built for the US and Royal navies. Lots of Photos of the different variants but the drawings are unfortunately no where near as detailed as some of the others in this series. Still, hard to find and collectable in itself, as each of the 36 books in this series is about a famous vessel, and the England is still a great book"
1,Don't be fooled - this is NOT the terrific mini-series,"It's hard to believe that grown-up people did this.Complete drivel from beginning to end. Avoid this dreadful mishmash. It's not even a good ""bad"" movie.It does no service to history. It's pleasure to see such fine actors at work esp. Henry Cele. They deserve a much better vehicle for their talents."
1,Watch at your own risk,"I had to do some research for a summer class on a battle/war/leader via film and the Zulu nation has always intrigued me. The only film I could find in my area was this one, unfortunately. Good thing I was able to find several good books because this movie - cut and pasted from a recent series - did not do Shaka, or the Zulu nation justice. More or less it was a movie about David Hasselhoff and a romantic interest. Their portrayal of Shaka was incorrect and the story was really ""Hollywood."" Several of the books I checked out matched up - this movie did not. If you want to watch a fantasy story about Shaka, look no further. I'm off to find something more factual. If your interested in this topic and want to read about it - look up The Washing of the Spears by Donald Morris, or The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation by John Laband."
2,Weak movie with a few bright spots,"I have never seen the mini-series, so I am reviewing this DVD as a stand alone film. Although I didn't think it was as terrible as some of the other reviews state, it was pretty bad overall. The story has a lot of holes and nonsensical moments. The overall character development is weak. I never felt as though I really knew a single character in the film. There was no major villian, although there were certainly some bad guys (slave traders). I'm really not sure what the point of the film was.The best part of the film took place on the slave ship. That one part of this film really drew me in and made me shudder. Those scenes helped remind me of how horrible a crime slavery actually was, and how we how lucky we are today. Then, those scenes ended with an unintentionally laughable escape sequence.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, but the slave ship scenes were enough for me to give it 2 stars."
1,how can this be a sequel?,"I'm confused... How can this be the sequel to the miniseries, when he dies at the end of the miniseries?this looks like it will suck compared to the original miniseries."
1,LadyA,"I haven't seen this movie, but I do own the 1986 Complete Mini-series and from what I see in the reviews I don't want to get this film. First of all Shaka was not captured by slavers. I don't know why this film depicts that. Is it because he was a majestic and dignified king and since the 1986 version showed that they had to put some stereo-typical depiction of Shaka being captured and defeated by the whites slavers? This sounds like a bunch of b.s. and I'm upset that they are showing this crap to students in high school. That is not what happened. If they want to show something for black history why don't they show the original 1986 version of the film. Even that had some false depictions in it too, but at least they had Henry Cele act like a king. It was his performance that made the movie believable and it brought backbone to the story line. Why he would reprise his role like this I don't know. But get the 1986 one please. It is way better."
3,Shaka Zulu,"I bought this as a present for someone who said they ""quite enjoyed"" it. Not too bad but I haven't watched it."
1,Shaka Zulu,"This movie was terrible. It was a complete waste of my money!I have the original version, which is excellent. I purchased this DVD because I thought that it would be comparable to the other movie about Shaka Zulu."
3,Shaka Zulu: The Last Great Warrior,"I found it to be a very strong and intense movie. I am not sure how close it is to the truth, but it was a very good movie."
1,So Demeaning to all the actors.,"Cele was the noble savage in the Shaka series and this movie is so demeaning to him and all the other actors in the movie. I don't know why they bothered to make it except for the monetary fact. Thinking the Series was profitable and a sequel would make more money. A slave trader falling in love with a proper English lady? O boy, what a stretch. Please, if you loved the series as I do, don't taint your mind with this terrible DVD."
2,Means well but ends horribly,"This movie is pretty hard to watch for anyone who likes a good drama or historical movies. Every scene was over the top and tried its best to make you care. Miss Farewell and Cpt. Prentice falling in love is nausiating. Yet, this tacky scene is trumped by the pitiful image of Grace Jones dead, sitting up with eyes open!!!!, because her man, Shaka Zulu, was away too long! The only highlights of the movie are the scenes where Shaka kicks butt and saves the day. The downside to that is the action scenes are so off the wall there's no point in saying it is based on a true story. Ex1-Shaka runs across Africa, on foot!, to kill a rivile king. Ex2-Shaka breaks the slave shackels from his wrists and takes over a slave ship single handed!It's one of those you have to see once to tell people it's nothing like the real miniseries movies.For the record, one of the worst sequels ever made. Should not be allowed to have the name ""Shaka Zulu"" on the cover!"
2,Disappointed,This is not the movie I was expecting. I thought it would be the film I saw on TV several years ago.
5,Like the book but did not receive the second book ordered,I order two books (I Dream a World) and received only one book I am still waiting for the second book to arrive. I have sent several emails to find out where the book is and I have not gotten anywhere. Will you please send me my book.I am willing to sign for the book when it arrive. If I don't receive my book I will not feel safe odering from you anymore. If don't receive my book in the next to weeks I will be pursuing a refund.The first book was a christmas gift for my niece and the second one was for me. I like the book that why I place a second order.
5,A Piece of History.... Would live it 6 stars is I could,"When I first saw this book in a speech class in College I asked my classmate when can I get that book!!! She purchased the book in 1999 for her childern and would not part from it!! I took down the ISBN number and the same night I went to Amazon to order, I was so excited to open the package. It was in PERFECT CONDITION, ALL THE PAGE WERE CLEAN, IT WILL BE APART OF MY LIFE FOR A LONG TIME !!!!!!"
2,"get the ""from the album"" version","This version of the book is the ""fake book"" version, as opposed to the actual transcriptions in the ""from the album"" version. While it is a perfectly adequate guide to the general structure of the tunes, the actual chord inversions, lead lines, picking patterns and fills are not even suggested here. If you want to play what's on the album, get the transcribed version."
1,Wrong one!,"If you think this book will teach you the songs on ""Unplugged"", it won't. This is just a simplified version of the song transcriptions and is pretty much useless.There's another version out there that contains the note-for-note transcrptions. That's the version I bought several years ago when ""Unplugged"" first came out, and that's the one you should buy..."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"This book is USELESS if you want to learn how to play this album. The tablature is only for the melody not the actual guitar parts, thus if you buy this book because you want to play like Clapton it won't help you at all. ~guy"
5,looking for the transcribed version?,"First of all, I gave this book 5 stars because I think that Eric Clapton: Unplugged earned it. If you're like me though, you might be looking for the tab book that has every song, note for note, including solos. After reading all the other reviews I got tired of the same complaint, but nobody mentioned where you could get it. So if you want the real deal go to musiciansfriend.com"
1,please do not buy,"so, as everyone else has already said this book really sucks.the only thing that is useful is chord chart at the top of the page.the chords are correct but are shown in the wrong order continuously on the manuscript.the genius who wrote this book has attempted some sort of classical version of claptonssongs trying to incorporate the vocal melody and chords together.he however has no understanding of how to do this has simply created a far more complex versionthat does not resemble the songs in any way.do not buy this book"
1,It's only EZ chords,"No where does it say (save for the picture of the book) that this is the EZ version of the songs. All this is really good for is knowing the chord changes and keys of the songs, not fills, solos or runs. This book is great if you are just looking to strum along and sing, but not much else. I wish it would have been stated some place else what this was..."
1,HORRIBLE,Simply I don't receive anything.the situation is extremely outrageous and absolutely detrimental to my rights as a buyer.I still have not announced anything about any delays or missed shipments.This is not way to treat a customer.It is certainly my last purchase at Amazon
1,Beginners...do not purchase!,"If you are a beginner I would advise you not to purchase this book, as it is so wrong it is past being rubbish.You do not get the songs that you are promised, but a very cut down version of them, and mostly in the wrong key, or alternate key from the original.I have been playing these songs for years but lost my copy of the unplugged book. I purchased this thinking it was the larger 112 page version (the real one), and was saddened by the lack of tab in this book and by the fact that it is factually incorrect.It states that ""Tears In Heaven"" is in G, when it is so obviously in E!All the songs in this book are wrong!!!This is not a good book, and all you get is melody lines! This may be good for an accompanying guitar but that is all.An absolute waste!"
2,bad condition,"The book was riped, and had stains and was wrinkled in the borders.Don't trust the condition, it looks bad in a lot of aspects.Information inside is good, and that's the only reason why I kept it.But I really expected a lot more for that price"
4,OPI,I absolutely Love the quality and color of OPI nail polishes. This is one of my favorites! Wear it all the time.
1,Don't Buy This POS,"Looks like a good piece of hardware at a good price.BUT if a level won't level... What is it worth??? Nothing!I bought this thinking it would self-level...In reality it will not. And instructions in non-English don't help.Save yourself some money and don't buy this product.It proports itself as being factory checked, but when it arrived, the""self leveling"" (critical part of a level) was non operatinal.... making the unitusulesss.BUY ELSWWHEREW!!!"
3,"OK, but...","Advertised as automatic leveling. Not so. You have to level it manually, using the bubble. Fairly easy to do that. Otherwise it works fine as a level."
1,Dissapointed,This item came missing the two containers.After several time trying to reach the company by phone they told me the product it was discontinued so why they shipped the item in this condition?The company has a really bad costumer service the need to improve it.Finally I got my money back.
3,A bit disappointing,"I try to be objective and fair in my reviews but I must admit I was somewhat disappointed with this strap; the leather (?) seems a bit stretchy almost rubber like.I am sure it will be fine used with an acoustic or light electric, but if you plan to use it on a Les Paul or similar guitar that weighs 8-9 lbs I would avoid this strap.Remember strap locks are important so have them fitted on your guitar strap pins or get a strap with built in locks."
3,Different product under the same name?,"We've ordered Planet Waves leather guitar straps twice now. The first batch were great. The second were completely different, nothing the same,so it's difficult to give an accurate review or the correct number of stars. They seem to completely different products under the same name, image and listing, although both are made in Canada. Explanation, please?"
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!,"Reel Big Fish is one of my favorite bands, I love all of their albums, I love all of the songs on this album. I would buy it if Reel Big Fish actually put it out. But alas, jive records, the evil lable that they just got out of put it out to cash up on RBF's success from their new live album. So, if your a fan, get the live album! Its awesome! Tell your friends not to get this for you fish fans!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!"
1,Jive does horrible job with this one! Not band's fault...,"Unfortunately Jive Records managed to show everyone the true stupidity that is behind every major label. Was it greed? Yes.This album's quality is not anything to be obsessed over when compared to ""Our Live Album is Better Than Your Live Album"" which the band released themselves. If you like Reel Big Fish then let their own album released on their own impress you, not something that Jive Records has beaten to death out of corporate greed."
1,don't buy it,"Don't buy this. horrible quality, go and get ""our live album is better than your live album""and go out to one of their shows and buy a shirt or four."
1,"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Buy ""A Best of Us for the Rest of Us"" or ""Our Live Album is Better than Your Live Album""","The songs on this album are fantastic, but this album was released without the band's permission after they left their former label. Either way, ""A Best of us for the Rest of us"" (preferably the bigger, better one) is a better value. Also, if this is your first Reel Big Fish album, I'd recommend ""Our Live Album is Better than Your Live Album"" as it's my favorite album ever and does an awesome job of showing new RBF fans how much better ska is when it's live.A Best of Us, For The Rest of Us (Bigger Better Bonus Deluxe Version)The Best Of Us For The Rest Of Us [Explicit]Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album [Explicit]Also, both these albums are multi-disk albums and Reel Big Fish really gives you an amazing value with how many songs they squeeze into a release (30 something and a DVD for the live album, and up to 78 on ""A Best of us for the Rest of us"""
1,"If you like Reel Big Fish, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!","This is a collection that Jive records put out without the permission of Reel Big Fish. Stupid mother frakkers. For the ""true"" greatest hits cd, check out Reel Big Fish's Our Live Album Is Better Than Yours."
1,"If you're a fan of Reel Big Fish, this isn't the album for you","The album was release by Jive Records after the band was released from their contract with Jive. Consequently, every ""greatest hits"" album that is bought, only gives the record company lots of money, and Reel Big Fish sees nothing. Whereas if you buy ""Our Live Album is Better than Your Live Album"", Reel Big Fish sees 100% of the profits, because it was self-released, and no record company was involved. Live album sounds better anyway.But then again, you could just buy this. And let someone else get rich off of you."
5,Cycle of Sorrow,"These songs are harrowing but beautiful and ultimately rewarding if you can survive its labyrinthine descent into heartbreak and despair. The most melodic songs include Caroline Says I and II, the wistful Oh Jim, the painful The Kids, the bleak The Bed and the soulful Sad Song.Over these beautiful melodies Reed lays his vocals that are so genuine, so apt and so gripping that listening to them is like being privy to the private details of a doomed relationship. Of course, these all fit the complete picture to create one of the most cohesive and searng concept albums in rock, from the jazzy intro of Berlin with its lounge piano through the spoken poem of Lady Day, right to the melancholy last refrains of Sad Song.The grand production and sympathetic arrangements add gravitas to the somber mood to create a dark masterpiece of epic proportions. Somewhat inaccessible to some fans, Berlin has nevertheless improved with time and remains one of Lou Reed's greatest albums."
1,Sargeant Pepper of the 70s my rear end,"No matter what anyone thinks or says (including Julian Schnabel) this is not a great album by any stretch of the imagination. It's mostly a collection of leftover Velvet Underground songs linked together. Incredibly overproduced (horns, strings, choirs, etc.) and nearly unlistenable."
4,Yes it Works,"This product is great for anyone looking to increase their virility and libido. Unlike testosterone creams and gels that can be messy, smelly or ineffective this liquid is a nice testosterone booster that can be used discretely.I like this product because I can slip into the restroom on a date and ingest 2 or 3 droppers full without my wife knowing. However, the effects of this product are subtle. You won't become a raging bull instantly but if you use it daily and then double up before lovemaking you will notice a difference"
2,"Love Larnelle, not this CD","I love listening to Larnelle, but was very disappointed in this Christmas CD. I will keep on listening to Larnelle, but will be giving away the CD."
5,Deliverance it is!,"This book is shurely not a teological one, but instead it is one written on experience."
3,Evil should hold no power over a good man.,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It seems to assign much more power to evil spirits than they actually possess. To go to extremes of ritual and drama to exorcise evil spirits is to assign to them a degree of power that they do not wield. Yet, as the author points out, this approach is not exclusively Christian, or even western, for certain Buddhist sects have also practiced simular rituals. No doubt the practice preceeds any of the surviving major religions.I'm not denying that disincarnate evil actually exists, but it cannot hold power over you unless you are operating at the same low level. It is far better to contemplate the Good in creation. Evil spirits can only enter a heart, or a mind, if it is empty of Good to start with."
1,Don't be fooled!,"This book is NOT about bad liquor. Heck, I thought it was an everyman's guide to finding the best stuff to get you drunk. Instead, it is bizarre book about this man's lifelong struggle with indigestion. Talk about boring. He was also possessed, however."
4,Jane Austen: In Style,"I bought this book because I was interested in Jane Austen. The book is divided up into sections such as country life, clothing, manners, food, etc. with a lot of details about this time and how it relates to Jane's life and situations. The book is lavishly illustrated with full page color photographs, and smaller pictures of Jane, Cassandra, and articles made or used by the Austen Family. It is well written and fun to read. It makes a good starting point for getting the feel of what life was like in Georgian England."
1,Ugh.,Just disappointing. The screws at the bottom came out and I wasn't able to put the thing together. I was not at all happy.
5,Very entertaining FAMILY FRIENDLY movie,It is very dificult to find a movie suitable for all ages in a family. This is a very good movie that shows how people of different backgrounds can get along. We need more tasteful movies like this.
4,looks exactly like the picture,this tiny silver frog is adorable!!but the part that fits onto your ear is totally hardto pry open. my fingers hurt!ditto my ear.but the shape is so cute that i took away just one startee hee:-)
3,adorable but not right...,this frog was so small and very cute but it was totally uncomfortable!! i've had others before that i lost in the years but ordering this one was a mistake!! it hurt SOOOOOO badly!! and putting it on was always hard. finally it just broke!!! don't bother.. find a different frog
4,hurts but is sooooo cute!,"Like the other reviewer, I love the shape of this cuff, but it hurts on the ear and gets caught in long hair. I have tried it on the lobe, upper part of my ear and inside part of my ear and doesn't matter. It's hard to get on and I'm constanly checking to make sure it's there.Even with all that I only took one star away beucase once on it is very cute if you can handle the discomfort."
2,gipped,I expected to recieve 2 frogs and only got 1. What happened to the other one? It is cute but toooooooooooooooooo little.
4,"Up and Down, but promising","I was surprised by how I got hooked into this, because I don't like this whole milieu. But the author has kind of ironic tone, always bordering on the satirical. I agree with some of the reviews that he lost it at the end. It seemed to me like someone required that the book end with a ""bang,"" and therefore it lost its sense of humor. But I still thought this author was talented. There were flourishes of good writing and a very good sense of characters living on the constant verge of humiliation. I look forward to another book."
1,NOT Good&#65533;pretty clear,"I offer a review of this book that was printed last week by the Dallas Morning News. I couldn't agree more:""Authors Garlow and Jones seem a bit reactive as they attempt to set straight the historical record against the ""smear campaign"" by Brown's novel. Brown, they say, uses ""venomous language"" when he accuses the early church of being misogynistic. This dumbed-down tome states things too simply. The authors beat readers over the head by including fear tactics - cheesy fictional vignettes of ""Carrie,"" a modern-day coed who struggles after reading ""The Da Vinci Code"" and is nearly swayed by her lesbian roommate, but eventually sees the light. There is some good historical background, but it's hard to get past the authors' exclamatory tone.""I am waiting to get The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code by Abanes. Shorter Cheaper. And seems like it might be good."
4,Challenging fiction represented as fact,I like that the authors stated at the beginning of the book that they only decided to challenge Mr. Brown's work of fiction when he stated on National TV that what he had written (excluding the characters and their actions)was based on facts. Very loose interpretation of facts on Mr. Brown's part. This book separates the facts from the fiction in a way that is easy to read and understand. I would recommend reading this book.
1,More fiction than The Da Vinci Code,"I really didn't get anything from this book other than the authors dislike for The Da Vinci Code. If you're really looking to learn more about this mystery, I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,"A biased, poorly written book","This is just a terrible book. Don't waste your money. There are few facts in this book, mostly just preaching. The ""narrative"" story line about a confused college call with a chain-smoking women's liberation Mom, and a lesbian roommate is offensive in its use of negative stereotypes.An unintentionally humorous part is when the author manages to brag about being a friend of John Lennon's and claims that he might well have become one of the Beatles. It has no reason to be in the book of course."
1,Go to church-- you'll learn more,"I bought this book hoping for a Christian perspective on the Christian-themed The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown. What I paid for is unabashed preaching on how the Gospel can be spread through never re-interpretting or revisiting the collection of stories called the Bible.These two theological scholars don't add any additional light to Brown's story nor do they actually show proof that the DaVinci Code couldn't have been true (which, in fact, I agree that most of Brown's work is fictional interpretation.)It seems like another opportunity for Christians to talk to themselves and reinforce a narrow viewpoint through villianizing the ""mass media"" and the general population. Pure back-patting fluff."
4,"Interesting, a recommended read","I didn't find the way this book was written particularly impressive, but it still contains some useful and interesting information. I have not read any of the other books out there that debate Dan Brown's ideas, so I have nothing to compare this book to, but the fact remains that Dan Brown does not have everything correct. I found it to be an interesting read regardless of one's opinion on ""The Davinci Code"" or one's religious persuasion. It is always a good idea to read as much as possible and do your own research from more than one point of view."
1,Let's act like we have something to hide!,What does it mean when someone gets excessively-defensive?It doesn't express that they have peace or comfort with themselves.Writing sludge like this just fuels the fire - that I suppose they are trying to put out. If .. there .. WAS .. ever .. a .. fire.
1,I've got a great idea!,"The Da Vinci Code is a worldwide phenomenon, staying on the New York Times Bestseller List for over 2 years. I think I'll throw together a quicky book with some alternate intepretations of biblical ""history"" that I got from looking up websites with Google one weekend. I'll slap the name ""Da Vinci Code"" in the title of my book and market it to delusional paranoids who spend every waking minute thinking about how the arts and entertainment world is at war with Christianity. I'll make a forture off someone else's success. It sure beats working for a living!God Bless America"
1,Faith & Truth,"People who have faith in God will believe no matter what is said, done, proved. There are many ""Truths"" in the universe and everything is based on perception. Maybe the Davinci Code is fiction or maybe a clever way to spread the ""truth"". Maybe the Davinci Code is ""truth"" and the church is trying to cover it up by having books and shows with ""experts"" saying it's fiction. You never know."
2,"""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, ""","""Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.""Hamlet by William Shakespeare: Act 1. Scene VCracking DaVinci's Code is a well written but ""Bazaar"" rebutal to a fiction book. The authors say it themselves ...The Da Vinci Code. ""A fun,fast-paced suspense novel."" (page 19, Cracking DaVinci's Code.) The next 235 or so pages are little more than circular logic and revisionist history. ""There is nothing new here"". There is are lot of distortions of history in this NON FICTION Book. Dan Brown also distorted history for his book, but was honest and called his book a novel.If you fear the power of a novel!If you think the ""Left Behind"" novels are Prophecy!If you fear there are Black Helicopters following you!This is a Da Vinci Code book for you."
2,I still have questions!,"I enjoyed reading the Da Vinci Code, but I knew it was full of fiction labled as facts. I wanted to read a book that would address some of the more egregious examples as well as answer questions about Da Vinci's art, the Priory of Sion, and the Council of Nicea. Instead I read a book which (a)did a fairly decent job of explaining Christian theology mixed in with (b) a cheesy narrative of one-diminsional stereotyped characters and (c) an obvious bias against anyone who did not follow the authors' prescribed beliefs. For example, every time the word ""feminist"" is used it is preceded by ""radical"". Hilary Clinton is even mentioned because she is friends with a pagan! I am a deeply committed Christian and I found this book to be offensive. If the intent of the book is to evangalise, it will fail because of its shrill voice. On top of that, other than the Council of Nicea, I still don't have any answers to my questions!"
1,Supremely Biased & Blind Dogma,"I have read both TDC and the Breaking the DaVinci Code. TDC was a great read with many intriguing elements to it while the Breaking Davinci code was a thinly veiled theological rant. The authors were guilty of the exact same things Dan Brown was accussed of meaning they presented their ""truth"" with paper thin proof. It is a very weak minded and preachy book written by authors who do not hide their prejudices. They needed to show better proof and be objective not supremely opinionated. They also needed to keep in mind that the dan Brown Novel was a work of FICTION. Most educated readers know this and they expect the intriigue that was presented to them. While some of his ideas on TDC were far fetched some were plausible and deserve exploration and THAT is the point of reading to get the mind going and to explore different ideas and topics not to be so singled minded that dogma blinds you. The authors of breaking the da vinci code should keep that in mind."
2,Facts and dogmas are not opposites,"I'm not Catholic, but I was interested in learning about any evidence disproves the theories set forth in The DaVinci Code,so that I would understand their opposition to the book. I thought this book would give me an objective view of the historic facts that The Davinci Code was based on, instead, it denied the theories using mostly beliefs as their supporting evidence.I was disappointed because I had a hard time learning, from an academic perspective, why the Catholic church might have been falsely represented in this book."
1,Total waste of time and I want my money back!,"Don't read the book even if it is the only book left on the earth surface. It was a total waste of time. Nothing new was offered in the book. It was written to ATTACK Brown's The Da Vinic Code. Nothing more. Why spending time attacking something fictional. The Da Vinic Code was a good, entertaining read. Readers should be able to tell facts from fictions."
1,Can I have my money back?,"Never in my life have I stopped reading a book because it was that bad. Until now. I guess I should have known when I read the first ""Carrie in distress"" story. Yikes. How did that get put in the book?""Gee, do you think our readers will be smart enough to know what we are talking about?""""Nope. Let's add in a fake dialogue between a lost college student, her lesbian roommate and some Christian geek to help them through the tough parts.""I would have loved to be in the room when Dan Brown read this. Of course, reading this means he must have taken a small break from his Satan worshiping. Give me a break."
4,"Basic, competent, readable","There are 71 more reviews of this book already posted so far -- what more can I add? Overall, whatever you think of the ideology of the authors, they know what they are talking about. Peter Jones has a Princeton Ph.D., Garlow's is from Drew. It is also written in a non-technical, highly accessible style. Another appeal, for me, is that it deals with teh broader cultural issues (Gnostic world-view) as well as just the details of the Da Vinci Code.I also appreciated Ben Witherington's book on the topic, and D. Bock, both world-class Biblical scholars."
1,Very very bad,"This is a very very bad book. Don't buy it!Just opinions no facts, and i was looking for facts!!"
1,boring!,"This is a fanatic's point of view trying to defend the nonsense called ""religion""Only read a few pages and put it down, a complete disappointment"
2,"How to cash in on a craze, volume 1","The following is a recreation of the events that transpired leading up to the writing and publishing of this book. The voice of James Garlow will be done by P. Diddy, the voice of Peter Jones will be a simple bicycle bell.------------J. Garlow: ""Yo, Pete... Yo, man, yo. We need to be rollin on some bills yo.""Peter Jones: ""Cha-Ching! Cha-Ching!""J. Garlow: ""YO, you ain't lyin, yo. But yo, how we gonna be gettin' dem dollas, yo?

Garlow: ""Bad Boy 4 Life.""------------Thank you."
4,"Interesting, thought provoking fiction","This book was quite interesting and thought provoking. It absolutely needs to be read as a fictional work. If you allow yourself to get caught up in it and forget it's a work of fiction, it could be quite upsetting. I have really enjoyed reading this book. It has sparked many conversations with friends and family."
1,Christian attempt at damage control,"Title says it all.If the bible-thumpers have nothing to hide, why are they having a conniption over The Da Vinci Code?Makes you wonder...."
1,Cracking the Da Vinci Code,"Do not waste your money on this thinly written and unsupported piece of trash. The authors apparently felt offended by a work of FICTION and decided to throw together a rant based on their religious views. If you are a serious historian, look elsewhere for unbiased and supported history."
5,Just what my husband wanted,This item was exactly what my husband was looking for. The price was incredible compared to what we could purchase the item for at our local stores.
5,Ugly Stik Casting Rods,I have other Ugly Stik (spinning & casting rods) in the past which I love them .they are very strong rod
4,Bob at his finest with music inc. Jazz,Wow; where do we start excellent music.Would give it a 5 star but the star is in Bethlehem and I need tohear more albums/CDs from Bob. Keep it coming Mr. Bennett!
3,"Cute, but didn't last too long.","The earring itself is tiny and very cute. The only problem is that the yin-yang symbol fell of after less than a year of wearing it. Now I am looking to replace it, but I think I will go with another brand."
3,review,"""when they say very tiny, they are accurate. can barely tell that they are a ying yang, but it is a nose stud. Just wish you could tell it was a ying yang"
2,i don't even know....,"I ordered this, thinking i would recieve a pair of stud 2mm earrings. instead, i got one 3mm earring on a black piece of cardboard that stated, ""lone stud."" I contacted the seller and they informed me that while normally we would ""percieve"" that i was purchasing a pair, i had actually purchased only one stud. so, spending another seven dollars, i purchased a second one. this one came as a PAIR of 2mm stud earrings! I mean, what???? Luckily, I have my nose pierced so i won't go through the hassle of returning the first stud, but I'd just like to let you know that my experience with this purchase was odd. In addition, neither the pair nor the ""lone stud"" truly resemble the picture shown. However, i believe them to actually look better than the picture, which is why i gave this product two stars instead of one."
5,Tiny treasures,"These earrings are SOOOO cute. They wern't kidding when they said tiny, but I love them."
5,"Wish the ""solutions"" were in a separate book","This is a really fabulous product. The wooden pieces are very well made and safe for the younger kids. My 5.5 yo loves it and will play with it for hours. It comes with a quality, colorful book. The puzzle that the children are supposed to replicate (simply by examining the picture) are on one page, the solution is on the back of said page. The puzzles progress into increasing levels of difficulty, and are labeled ""starter, junior, expert, master"". I do think this would be appropriate for children younger than 5, my 5.5 yo whizzed through the first two levels without much difficulty ~ but she still had a lot of fun doing them.I really wish the solutions were in a separate book that the parent could remove from the area and only bring out after the child is truly stumped. As it is, its way too simple for the child to turn the page and peek. Other than that, its a perfect game that a child is able to play with alone, if desired."
2,Double pieces and one piece missing,"This came with two orange pieces and a missing green piece. This item has to be returned and then reordered through Amazon as they do not exchange this toy. The Castle Logix company was very hard to deal with just trying to get a green piece sent. It is a really great toy when the correct pieces are packed, but a pain when they are not."
4,Solid Performer,"this Lexar 512 card is a nice card. I have used Sandisk and Viking cards previously. And the Lexar is keeps up with them. Not the fastest of the bunch, but I havent had a problem with losing any images. (between the three brands I have had the most problems with Sandisk, all 512 cards)I shoot with a Canon G5, 5MP camera and for weekend trips this card works great. Shoots fast enough for my camera, but have noticed is a bit slow when I try and review images on my camera. but not much. only reason I gave it a 4.For the 29.99 price though don't hesitate, it's a good deal.cheers-"
4,"A very odd, pretty enjoyable curio.","4 buddy WWI pilots, out of work after the war, start doing stunt flying on a Hollywood movie,directed by the evil Eric Von Stroheim (in a very enjoyably over the top performance making funof his own reputation). Of course, as absurd luck would have it the leader of the squad'sex-girlfriend is now married to Von Stroheim, though she hates him.Spoiler's ahead!Von Stroheim plots to try to get his wife's ex-lover killed in an impossible stunt, and is goingto make sure by putting acid on the control cables, but another flyer goes in his place an dies,and the remaining 3 grab Von Stroheim to get their revenge, leading to a tense, dark but prettysilly conclusion. While watching , the silly plot twists and lack of logic bothered me, but the nextday I found myself thinking of it fondly."
4,"Human rights history is great, and badly needed.",Highly recommended to everybody. The book is an attempt to provide an account of the evolution of human rights over time and through political and philosophical thought. The author is well versed in political science and shows it off in this book while surfing in a very wide literature. It is well written. Two drawbacks in this beautiful book: not enough history of human rights; a scarce attention to those movements which paved the way to future developments but were unsuccessfull at first. Great piece of work anyway! Look forward for Vol. II.
4,"Readable, interesting, well-researched",This book is a great overall history of human rights. I really liked how it talked about the origin of ideas and then wove those ideas throughout the book. It's a very well-researched and complete work. One thing that does is make several assertions that are extremely contentious among human rights scholars; for example it contends that human rights is a concept that is western in origin.
4,Problem fixer,"They did the job, quiet down my suspension noise, but here and there i can hear them make a bit noise nothing compare like it was.overall good product"
4,A very funny comedy; even though it's far from reality,"For all you young students who are planning your careers in the medical field, this film should serve as a warning to you. This is one extremely tough field to get into and when you're there, it takes an awful lot of determination and self-discipline to stay there and succeed. In reality, schools like the one in this film simply don't exist. This film is funny and enjoyable if you just put all sense of reality aside for about an hour and a half."
3,"Cheap shots and all, I love this movie!","This movie makes me laugh. I don't know why, but it does. I have seen it many times and now I want to own my own copy because I always enjoy watching it again. It has some very funny moments."
1,Don't watch this,"We just had a discussion: what's the lamest movie you've ever seen? Not in terms of being so bad it's actually worth watching for its sheer awfulness - just _bad_ bad. In my memory, this one is it. I hesitate writing this at it is giving it more credit than it's due. Yawn."
4,Just like UAG - Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara,"Oh God, as a graduate of UAG I should say that this movies is nothing like the movie but I can't lie. The Madera's own the med. school.. the Leano's own the med. school. The Dean does not care about students.... Dean Villalobos and Martinez Sandoval dont care about the students. The infrastructure is a bit outdated.... you guessed it!! UAG's buildings are as old as Fenway without any upgrades. Oh yeah, the pride and joy of the institution is the infamous PMC program: ""Programa Medicina en Comunidad"", just like in the film!!!! It is a riot! If you plan to go to UAG you must watch this film. If you get a hold of it, bring it down to Guadalajara so you can laugh."
1,Poorly advertised product.,"Believed I was purchasing the disk, not some strange download beast. Don't know what to do with it.Wasted 10 bucks."
4,Great Book,"This is a wonderful book discussing the cycle of gift in myth, fables, the modern world and poetry and art.It is surprising and refreshing. Well worth the read."
5,The other half of economics,"The first essay in this compilation of three is one of those pieces that can potentially change a person's life. Any student of the social sciences becomes aware that there are many important exchanges made in society which are not and cannot be valued in market transactions. Hyde offers a thoughtful analysis of the social function of goods and services exchanged outside the structure of the market. These arguments are essential as a counterbalance to the positivism expressed in most economic thought today.A good deal of the material from which Hyde draws can be found in Marcel Mauss's book, also called in English, *The Gift* (Essai sur le don). Anybody who has loved Hyde's book will want to read Mauss's as well."
5,Inspiring Music,"Though it was my Grandpa who introduced me to Frank Patterson's music, I think young people can appreciate him, too. His styel is simple and honest, as though he is speaking just to you. I was fortunate to find this VHS tape on sale second hand, and I enjoy listening to and watching it as much now as when I first got it. Mr. Patterson sings in beatiful locations in Ireland and the United States . . . and his selections are some of the favorites of all time. At first it was hard for me to understand his words, as his voice is operatic, but soon I was able to follow him pretty well. ""I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen"", ""Whispering Hope"", ""The Wind Beneath My Wings"", and also a violen peice done by Mr. Patterson's son are very nicely done, and remain my favorites on this film. Delightful in every way. I wish I had more music by him."
4,Bittersweet comedy,"A bittersweet comedy, with many bright moments of happiness about a garbage man's life. This is a well-made film with very good production values. I recommend this movie highly. Entertaining and poignant, with a light side."
3,Decent introductory book.,"Tom Meigs, Ultimate Game Design: Building Game Worlds (McGraw-Hill, 2003)While there's a decent amount of useful information here, the reader of books on game design has seen a good deal of it before in other game design books. If it's your first game design book, it will likely be quite helpful to you; those who have read two or three other general books on game design are likely to only get anything out of the interviews."
5,Best game design book so far...,I have been looking for a game design book that shows me examples of how to do stuff fast and not just talk about players that want this or that in their games. This one shows you everything you need to know. I think after reading it that you can start making a game fast and get it out there. It is thebest I can find.
4,Very helpful because,"I really liked the interviews with the game creators at Blizzard/Lucas/Sony and all. The sections on learning how to make up behavior helped out alot. Now I feel like, I'm armed now to take on the industry and it was an easy read with great payoff."
5,pulled me deep into the story,"The story was different from what I usually read. As I began reading it I hesitated to continue then Turgeon pulled me INTO the story. I felt I was there. She has an amazing ability to do this. I just downloaded another one of her books, GODMOTHER, to see if she has the same effect again."
5,Wonderful CD.,"I originally had never heard of the Solitudes collection. Then I had a work injury that needed massage therapy. While I was in therapy to recover, the lady doing the massage put this CD in. Never had I heard such a melody of music and nature that was so peaceful. Along with the treatment and listening to the music, by the time my treatment was near completion each time, I was beginning to drift off.Peaceful and serine. If you need to unwind, or have had a stressful day, I reccomend this CD.It doesn't hurt to play it during a massage, either. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed! ^_^"
3,A hiss when listening with earphones,"I'm giving a 3 because there is an annoying hiss when listening with earphones. It's still there when listening through the speaker, but much less discernible. The distortion is alright, but does not cover a wide enough frequency range and is only near-satisfying on very few settings. But I guess this was never meant to perform like a standard amp, but at least they should have taken care of the earphone hiss, since earphone listening falls directly under the application of this product."
5,It's a Champ!,"The Danelectro mini amp was an impulse buy for me, but this thing is fantastic! clean tones to woodstock fuzz, this thing belts 'em out. only complaint- battery doesn't last too long. get a power adapter. otherwise- GREAT PRACTICE AMP!"
3,Amplify,I bought this Amp to give to our 6yr. old daughter for Christmas along with a microphone and stand. It works great and looks authentic. It's small enough for her to clip on her waistline and sing like a star or sets perfectly on the floor or stool next to her. I will say it had a rattle when we first received it so my husband took the back off and there was a screw rattling around inside of the amp. Not sure what the screw was from but the amp still works fine. Alls well I suppose. We are satisfied.
1,JUNK!!!! NO CLEAN SOUND!!,this little amp looks cool and touts the fact that it makes many tones. bs. mine only makes distortion. its pretty cool distortion but with no clean this thing is rather useless. its sounds terrible with both my guitars (Epi Les Paul Special with stock pickups / Squire Strat with SD HotRails in bridge) so i cant imagine its the pick ups. also maybe im just deaf but this thing is quiet. but what do you want for 20 bucks. avoid.
1,"5W amp, the worst I've ever heard","this little made in China plastic thing is just good in the trash. I had to spend $8 to send it back to Musician's ""Friend."" it was soooooo bad. I put a mic on it, and at over 3 volume in a scale of 0 & 10, it screeched so bad I had to shut it off. So I tried guitar connector in, and the same thing. It was soooo lame. What technical ""twang"" and etc. above was all b.s. Might as well go to Toy R Us and get a legit amp for $30 if not on sale for $20!!!"
5,Not what I expected,"While this amp is not what I expected, My daughter still loves it. It is smaller that I had expected and runs on battery unless you order the 9V extension cord separately...which I did, but only after realizing that I needed it when the amp arrived. Overall I would recommend this product, just be sure to order the cord at the same time as the amp. My little girl has fun doing standup comedy and takes vocal requests!"
4,Mini Amp,"I bought this mini amp to use with my Tacoma Chief acoustical/electrical guitar. It is small, has great amplification for powering my Chief, and really is quite good for what I want it for.The only drawback I can see is that if one is not a great guitar player, it does enhance and multiply my mistakes too!I really like the color too. It looks very retro and the color is exactly what the item is shown to be."
3,Honey Tone Mini Amp in Aqua?,"First off, based on the picture I saw from my computer screen, I thought the Amp would be a light baby blue-ish color. My amp arrived and I think it's more of a seafoam green color. That threw me off a little, but it's okay, it's still cute. Another part, I'm new with using mini amp's so I'm not 100% sure how they work but I think mine's a bit sensitive or raspy? There's a hissing noise to it that won't go away playing or not playing the instrument. It's a bit similar to the sound you get when you land on a channel on your tv that doesn't have anything playing, so it's just like shzzzzzz with the black and white screen. The hissing noise is a bit distracting, but considering that the mini amp was $20, I won't let it disturb me too much. Overall, I think it was an all'right purchase."
2,Nothing Special,This is quite smaller than I thought it would be. I purchased it to go along with my Kids Pro Pak Microphone. You have to purchase an adapter cord if you don't want to be changing batteries all the time and the sound wasn't very loud. I ended up returning mine since the sound cut in and out and got the Rogue G10 10W 1x3.5 Guitar Combo Amp Black for $5 more and the sound is much better comes with a cord.
5,Great Gift,Bought this for my 6 year old daughter she loves it bought Center Stage Microphone to go with it. She is having a blast!!
4,Good amp. for on the go jamming.,"This is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier. The controls are Volume/ off, Tone, and overdrive. It also has a headphone jack. In my honest opinion, it is a good headphone amplifier to use when to need to practice without disturbing people around you. The speaker sound is fine for a clean sound ( like jazz, or country) or semi distorted and more (rock). If your looking for an small amp. that will do metal this may not be for you. Defintely get the Danelectro DA-1 AC power adapter instead of batteries because you may go through them quick. Overall it's pretty good."
1,Was good...,"When I first got this amp, I was really excited about how cute, loud, and convenient it was. I walked around my house with the amp clipped into my pocket and felt like a wandering guitarist. But after using it less than a dozen times, the sound suddenly started to fade in and out. I changed the battery, but the result was the same. I exchanged the product in store (Guitar Center), but the moment I put in the battery and turned on the 'new' amp, the problem was immediate. I suspect I picked up a refurbished one. I don't know if buying the AC adapter would fix the problem, but if I have to use one to play, then my purpose for buying this is lost. It is really a shame because it is a great deal to simply amplify sound. I don't require much...but the fading of the sound is such a disappointment."
4,Good but not great,"I wanted this so I could play my electric guitar out and about, and for the most part it satisfies my needs. The amp has only a volume, tone, and distortion knob, but that is enough for it's use. This amp can actually get pretty loud, but it also gets really distorted. The distortion is kinda disappointing, as any thing past around 4-5 is just a fuzzy mess and sounds rather bad. It also has really poor battery life, so expect frequent replacements. I use it mostly with a 3.5"" jack to another speaker, as that sounds a lot better and saves the battery.Overall this is a good amp if you want something portable, just don't expect it to replace your normal amp."
5,Danelectro N10A Honey Tone Mini Amp,Very nice sounding little mini amp. A bit bigger then I expected but a nice size so you dont walk off without it. Good for taking on trips where space is at a premium. Battery life depends on how loud you play. Usally get around five hours out of mine playing it with the volume set about halfway. Ive had no problems with cutout so far but others report that they have had problems with theirs. I would recommend these little amps to anyone who is looking for a mini amp.
1,Buy Our Live Album,"Buy Our Live Album is Better Than Your Live Album instead. The band currently gets no money from this album. While it is not a bad album per say (I do own it), their live album is the same quality, and honestly a bit funnier. Plus, it features more songs.Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album"
1,Don't Buy!,"Buying this album is basically the worst thing a fan of Reel Big Fish can do.Why you ask?When Reel Big Fish split from Jive records due in part to poor promotion for their then-latest album ""We're Not Happy 'Til You're Happy"", Jive kept records the band had made with them previously. Attempting to capitalize off of the band's previous success and their newly released live album ""Our Live Album is Better than Your Live Album"", Jive released ""Greatest Hit...and More"". While lead singer Aaron Barrett released a statement stating that, while unhappy of the label's attempt to gain off of their success, he was fine knowing that people would be enjoying the band's music. However, he soon retracted this statement after hearing the ""remastered"" tracks, which were of extremely poor quality.In short, not only is this album not a ""true"" Reel Big Fish album, but you, as a buyer, are not even getting decent recordings! For a true RBF ""greatest hits"" album, go for the live album."
1,"Go buy ""Our Live Album is better..."" or ""Monkey's for Nothin...""","I've heard RBF said to not buy this album and I will do whatever they say, even if I didn't verify they said it, they rock. This album was not authorized by RBF but put together by their old label. I own pretty much all their album releases including their recent (as of 2008) live album titled, ""Our Live Album is better..."" That live album is basically a greatest hits in live format which I believe is far superior anyway to this album here and better captures RBF's energy. I highly recommend this live ""greatest hits"" over this album. Or, if you want a greatest hits of studio releases just go buy the original albums on Amazon used. They are cheap and you'll get all the songs which is great since there are very few RBF songs that don't belong on a ""Greatest Hits"" collection anyway so you'll be better off."
1,Reel Big Fish Rocks,"Reel Big Fish rocks, but ""Our Live Album IS Better Than Your Live Album"" is the best greatest hits you WILL ever get because live RBF is more talkitive, more funny in that way, and it makes their live stuff better, just the raw sound of ska music as well, it's called life, love it."
5,Tacoma 4runner Front Strut,"Used these on both the 4runner and Tacoma and I am very impressed over the stock Bilsteins and Tokicos. Vehicles used to rock side to side and felt very soft(bottomed out easily). These cured the problems and they are also very well made, the lower mount on most units have a set of rubber bushings, these however have a much sturdier more precise semi-rotational heim joint. That is a feature that is usually only found on ultra highend products!!! Way to go Gabriel."
5,Adam Sandler Is BIG DADDY,"BIG DADDY is a comedy starring Adam Sandler as Sonny Koufax, a slacker who has a job working one day a week at a toll booth. When his girlfriend threatens to dump him, Sonny looks for a way to fix this disaster, and that's when a kid named Julian gets dumped on Sonny's doorstep. Sonny plans to adopt Julian so that his girlfriend can see how responsible he is, but then he finds out that his girlfriend is having an affair with an older man, and Sonny is stuck to raise Julian as his son on his own. This a halarious film, one of Adam Sandler's best. If you like Adam Sandler or comedy in general, you need to see this movie."
4,Big daddy review,"I watched this movie for like the 15th time last night and I was still rolling on the floor laughing. This is the best Adam Sandler movie he has made, and the little boy is a cute little actor too. I just love this movie."
1,Adam! What have they done to you!,This movie had attempts at jokes that were even worse than the one atempted in the Truman Show! This wasn't funny at all! I wouldn't even recomend this to a die-hard Adam Sandler fan! Do yourselves a favor and rent the Waterboy or Happy Gilmore instead!
4,the true sandler fan,"Anybody who thinks the Happy Gilmore wasn't adams best movie is not a real fan, especially if they think the waterboy was the best, waterboy was awefull, but about this movie, people are right in saying he always plays a slacker and it gets old but it makes the movie more realistic cause adam is a slacker or at least he used to be, this is a fine film, not his best, not his worst. some things were funny, like true funny, like his friend that can't read. and the kind and extremely aware of his situation bum. The bar drunk. He could have made whole movies out of any of this characters, thats why adam rules, and if you dont like it, you are on the incorrect"
1,No Redeeming Values,"This film glamorizes everything that is wrong with our society. Just take one look at the cover. Is that the type of public behavior that you want to teach your children? Skip this for your own sake. Besides, it's not funny even when it tries to be."
1,cussing at a child! Lord help us,"I was handed a bucnh of vhs tapes that someone did not want anymore and I only saw as much as I could take of this one and I thru it in the trash Here's a movie that has it all, acceptance of homosexuality, cussing at a child, sex before marriage or outside of marriage, and a lowest of human beings has been given the integrity to be a Dad. Lord help us!"
1,"Huh, huh kid peed on the wall","It waz pritty funnie when this kid peed, also all the Hoodars jokes! Adem Shandler is hairlereus! O yea, when the skatters god tribted almust mad me peed in my pandds! Then at the end it wus all happy for Sunny, my hart was wormed."
5,Great Comedy,"I enjoy Adam Sandler, he always has done a nice job at al lthe characters he took on.He plays Sonny this time, yes still another immautre character.(like in his other films)Sonny wants to gain his girl friends attention.After finding a little child beside his door (Jullian) he soon becomes atatched.Although Sonny uses him alittle for attention, he soon realizes Jullians position and is willing to take him in for good.This movie has its funny moments and a plot that i can actual believe.The music was awsome with the Garbage song ""When I Grow Up""I think this is a really sturdy movie Adam Sandler is improving in acting and in general humor.I really think anyone could enjoy this movie and alot of the jokes you'll probably constantly talk of afterwords."
2,Funny at first but very old by the middle of the movie.,"Ok, this movie does have some funny parts but it gets very old about 20 minutes into the movie. The ""little on-liners"" are over-used and are irritating. I will admit that Adam Sandler is a funny guy but this movie does not reflect what he is possible of acheiving."
2,typical american movie,This is a typical american movie. Just a short story with a few laughs. This is the kind of film that you want to see one time only. Only a typical american ignorant fool would like this film. Get the Matrix instead.
4,Big Daddy DVD,The Big Daddy DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition. I would definitely do business with this seller again. I gave this a rating of 4 because I wish that there was a way to combine shipping on Amazon when buying multiple items from one seller versus paying shipping on a per item basis.
3,. . . It was okay,"It wasn't bad. It wasn't good either. I was just mediocre. Some of the jokes fell flat, and some others didn't. The gay jokes were too overwhelming, while the kid jokes were spot on. Sandler, Schneider, Buscemi, and others really did a good job with their performances. Even though I can't stand the Sprouse brothers, they did very well as Julian. So yes, Big Daddy was just okay, not good nor bad. It's not as strong and downright hilarious as Sandler's other films like The Waterboy and Billy Madison, so don't count on a laugh-out-loud experience here.Grade: C"
5,Adam Sandler Is Funny Once Again!,This movie rules! When it came out in theaters I saw it and I liked it so much I saw it twice! If you love Adam Sandler then you will love Big Daddy!
1,"Gross, unfunny, sloppy, annoying","Big Daddy started out depicting Sonny (Adam Sandler) as your typical distastful bachelor brainless wonder searching for the good life with a beautiful girl by his side and ended with him having it all (the money, the friends, the wife, the kids, the status) while still enjoying the pleasures of singledom. The plot was okay, but the language and the content was disgusting. You must have a strong stomach to watch this movie. There was no real comedy. There were real issues brought to light, but no real examination of them. It was depressing and dull."
1,i didn't like it,"even though the sprouse twins are cute, the plot sorta sucks. its not really funny, and obviously the directors did a poor job with poor effort."
1,Some kind of bad,"I am a big fan of Sandler - this makes it all the more difficult to slam this movie. This was a 3 star movie - a marginal recommend - until the movie wraps up. I'm all for a happy ending but this was ridiculous! Our hero gets married, now works as a lawyer, has a child of his own, is still best buds with his original ""son"" Julian, and to top it off he can have a laugh at his ex-girlfriend working a menial job at Hooters with the guy she dumped him for. Just like it works in real life, right? Ugh! The ending is bad enough to knock this movie down to one star. Sandler's talents are wasted with this dog."
1,Big Disappointment,"If you consider an unimaginative plot, street language used by a toddler, and public urination to be entertainment, then this movie might be for you. Otherwise, I suggest you skip this movie.""Big Daddy"" is billed as a comedy, but I found little to laugh about. Furthermore, the plot was predictable and shallow. I would not recommend this film to anyone."
2,"big daddy, big waste of time","I loved Adam Sandler in ""Happy Gilmore,"" but ""Big Daddy was almost unwatchable. My husband and I watched this movie recently, and we had a hard time staying awake. Sandler's character is an obnoxious, aging adolescent; his character is unlikeable and bordering on child abandonment in his treatment of his young charge. Maybe with a young actor playing Sandler's role, this story could have been believable. I am glad that we did not waste any money buying this DVD."
3,Not the normal Adam Sandler movie,"Big Daddy was an ok movie, it probably would have been better if they hadn't shown all of the funny parts in the previews."
1,Parental Failure,"So many critics have called Adam Sandler's work subpar, and I couldn't agree more. His only joke is that funny voice he makes; just watch him--in every single movie, CD, and SNL skit he has done, he does that pathetic excuse for a funny accent. It has worn thin, and so have his movies. ""Big Daddy"" is disturbingly irresponsible. Critics that call his character ""a good father in his own way"" must not have seen the movie I saw. Adam Sandler crosses a line and does not make light of it or even acknowledge it, whereas good comedies like ""There's Something About Mary"" recognize that they have crossed the line, but set the tone correctly as to make the audience feel good about laughing. Laughing at ""Big Daddy"" just doesn't feel right. To see a movie that finds humor in the more disturbing things in life, rent ""Happiness"". It's an example of how to set the right tone."
1,Dysfunctional idiot and kid,"This movie was a pathetic attempt to grab our heart strings, but was only effective in loosening my purse strings. It's about a very dysfunctional idiot (Adam Sandler) who takes on the job of setting the absolute worst possible example for a child. This movie is a joke and everybody who watches it is a victim. I generally think Adam Sandler is funny, but I didn't laugh once. Note to self: never watch another Adam Sandler flick again. Note to Adam: Get some new material. Two thumbs down!"
1,Another bad movie with Adam Sandler...,"It never changes, casting Adam Sandler gets you one of the dumbest movies one can see. It was bad enough Wedding Singer was made, but they keep getting dumber. In this one he watches over a kid, who probably has a higher IQ than him in reality. I have but one suggestion to Adam Sandler, go back to Saturday Night Live that was the only place you were tolerable. GRADE: D-"
2,oh come on adam,Ok. I must admit i love adam sandler i love billy madison and happy gilmore but this movie was pure lame it had breif homosexual content lots of toilet humor and nothing more i think film writers are taking big risks making this type of movie we the normal folks of the world need to give them the messege to bring family values back in to films
2,I was pretty disappointed.,"You'd think that with a superstar like Adam Sandler, ""Big Daddy"" would be really good. Unfortunately, it's not. ""Big Daddy"" has it's moments, but not enough to save it. Even Adam Sandler himself can't save it. When I saw it advertised on TV, I liked the idea because it looked and sounded funny. And you'd expect it to be. I mean, Adam Sandler's characters are nearly always silly, childish and immature and you can just imagine him trying to take on the responibilities of caring for a little kid. You just can't help but laugh. However ""laugh"" is what I didn't do as much as I expected to when I saw ""Big Daddy""."
2,No one over the age of 13 should watch this movie!,"Many people, mainly Adam Sandler and his few friends, thought that this movie was funny - it isn't. Look Who's Talking is funny, Three Men & Baby is funny, more recently Ace Ventura and The Mask are funny, but this isn't. All the best bits, which everyone's seen in the trailer, seem long winded and drawn out in this movie. Big Daddy Small Laughs I'm afraid. Sure kids will love it, anyone under the age of 13 will laugh at Sandler's goofy face, it's just all-round hilarious kids movies have been made before and are at the cinemas now, don't waste your money or time with a half-witted video that your kids will grow out of in less then a week. Trust me, they would like Ace Ventura, Bugs Life or Chicken Run better than this pile of Adam Sandler."
2,"Big Daddy, not that funny",I did not think this was a very funny movie. I did not get the laughs I expected.
5,One of the best Adam Sandler movies!,"I have been wanting to see this movie when it was in theaters but now that I got it on video I enjoyed it. It's about a guy named Sonny who's searching for a job so that he can get his girlfriend back and he finds one where he takes care of a little kid. Man, that little kid is cool. I recommened that if you hadn't seen this movie yet should it's a great movie to own and you will like it, it's better than his others!"
4,best Sandler movie yet,"this movie is very funny. the plot is a bit weak, but the dialague makes it worth the time. the movie makes simple things like falling rollerbladers, peeing on the sidewalk, and a action figure named scuba steve so very funny. buy this movie. it is worth it. happy gilmore is also a good sandler movie. see that too."
3,funny movie,"this movie was kinda stupid the first time i saw it,then i saw it again and it was much better for some reason,i dont know why.it was more funnier.this is one of Adam Sandler's ""okay"" movies.not his best movie.Happy Gilmore is.but this one's still good"
3,Pretty Good,This was an OK movie. I laughed a bit. I just took two stars off it because of Adam Sandler. He isn't a good actor.
2,I Don't Know How He Does It,"Somehow, Adam Sandler has racked up a series of hit movies. While this may not go down in history as one of the great movie mysteries, it's still mystifying how he manages to draw a crowd especially when he's playing it relatively straight here.Gone are the crass antics of a Wedding Singer and out are the mentally-challenged slapstick of a Waterboy. Here, Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a law-school grad (???), living a life of nothingness who inadvertantly finds himself custodian of one little boy.Now, the antics begin ... some in good taste ... some ... er ... well, some just fall flat.While some of the jokes are funny, I have to admit that I miss the screaming humor of Happy Gilmore. It might've been more in step here, and watching Bob Barker beat the stuffing out of Sandler one more time would've been worth the price of admission."
4,Well........,"In a cynical view of this movie, you could probably say that Adam Sandler made it to impress critics. However, this is probably my least favorite Adam Sandler movie for lots of reasons. Above all, it gets WAY too sappy. I mean most AS movies get sappy intentionally, but come one, the whole montage scene at the end was too much. Secondly, it strives for the kind of coolness factor ala the Kevin Smith films, Swingers, and the like. AS films were never meant to be as mentally challenging as those films, and I know I sound like the average AS fan when I say all this. However, not all is bad. There are some funny lines/scenes (all he does is eat and sleep, he's like a damn cocker spaniel) but mainly, the film fails because it tries to hard. However, you could say that AS achieved his goal-most critics liked it, however I don't."
4,Big Daddy=Big Laughs,"Adam Sandler is great in Big Daddy. Not only is the movie extremely funny, but may bring you to tears. It is a great movie and I know I love it."
4,good,i enjoy it because it was a family movie. i got and add to receive a Free video or Music Title from your company and under 15.00 dollars . how do i get one of these . I refer video.
4,Not Adam Sandler at his best but close enough,"New York tollbooth worker and failure to his family Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) who really has not decided to take the next step in life and become a successfull something or other as opposed to big overgrown kid still living off leftovers and pizza has a son, Julian, of his roommate's dying wife show up at his doorstep moments after his roommate moves to China. Sonny really has nothing going for him whatsoever, his girlfriend has just left him and now he has to support a hyper, five year old running throughout his apartment. This movie takes on a more happy loving feel than other dumb funny Sandler movies. Renee Zelwegger plays Sonny's new girlfriend who loves Julian, and loves Sonny. This movies happy feeling is sure to have a smile across your face for the majority of it and has a great ending, and will also make you laugh throughout much of it."
3,Big...,"Adam Sandler is Sonny and he has to take care of his friend's kid. The boy smells, wets his pants and watches the worst television programming anybody could watch. At least Sonny taught him a thing or two about tripping roller bladers and getting the ladies' attention. Hey, he was good for something! Sonny's friend, a delivery guy couldn't read and McDonald's should have an earlier lunch menu. Over time, Sonny and Frankenstein bonded like father and son, something Sonny never had. It was truly heart warming. Just kidding. A good Sandler movie."
3,Story?,"The kid was as cute as he could be. He worked well with Adam Sandler. The comedy was good, but the story was weak. But, it was still a good movie all the same."
2,"not very bad,but far from good","Pros:*Rob Schneider and Jon Stewart,though secondary,are very funny.*The kid was cute and convincing.Cons:*Very dramatic ending.If it were funny,it would've been better.*The jokes aren't much.Bottomline:When I heard that it was a comedy that grossed about 150-60 million dollars,I thought that it could be just as funny as Kingpin or Dumb&Dumber.If you're an Adam Sandler fan,it's good.Otherwise,if a few laughs make a movie worth it to you,give it a rent in a boring weekend."
1,big dafdy,Big daddyIf you like funny movies big daddy is the movie for you. The 93 minute family packed advancer.With Adam Sandler as sonny Koufax and Cole and Dylan sprouse as Julian it is the funniest pg13 movie I have ever seen.I though this movie was a fantastic movie the sound affects and the camera angles make the movie even funnier .If you want to see a funny movie see big daddy.
2,Not as good as the trailer would make you believe!,"I seen the trailer, and it looked hilarious. However I left the theater disapointed;If the film was half as good as the trailer would make you believe this would have been a comic masterpiece!"
4,great little laser,"this is a great little laser for a good price. it really comes in handy when transferring lines to the ceiling. i haven't used it for a horizontal line yet. I have a rotating auto laser for that.You won't regret buying this laser. It does what it says it will do and auto levels manually, not electronically, so less to worry about breaking in the future."
5,GREAT BOOK!,I am a 14 year old girl and this book is the best craft book that i have read!! I love the projects in it and it inspired me to do more crafts instead of always watching tv! The projects are so unique and I especially love the robot key chain one! I cant wait to read and do crafts with the next book that Sherri Haab writes! So in conclusion i seriously recommend this book to everyone!
5,Great training aid,"This training aid is great and I can already see results. It is very consistent. The only downside is if it is not on flat ground, you have to tap the balls to get them going again. Overall, I completely recommend this to any aspiring player."
5,Kajagoogoo music and videos are wonderful!,"I am 50 years old as is Duran Duran's Simon LeBon. Listening to 80's music and watching 80's videos remind me of some of the very best days of my life. Kajagoogoo, like Duran Duran, is one of the greatest pop bands from the best days of MTV. Remember when MTV was fun and uplifting to watch?! Remember you could see fun stuff like Kajagoogoo videos on MTV? I hate MTV today. Anyway, this 3 song VHS is a must-have item if you are an 80's and/or Kajagoogoo fan. I preserved my Kajagoogoo VHS onto DVD so I can enjoy it until I croak-off someday. Kajagoogoo should make more music..."
2,"Okay, but nowhere near as good as its predecessors","Although I _LOVED_ the stories in the other books of this series (and highly recommend the other books), I was very disappointed with this one. Perilously few ""reached"" or ""touched"" me as they had in the earlier books."
5,Chicken Soup for the soul is an excellent book.,A 5th Portion of Chicken Soup for the soul is an extremely excellent book because it teaches unique lessons.
4,A great book,"I think that this book was terrific, even though there were other Chicken Soup books that I thought were better. Almost all of the stories had a moral in them and the ones in the end especially made me cry. I think that the Chicken Soup books will be great just like they are now in the years to come."
5,COCKLE DOODLE DO,".The image on the first page of this book is probably the most vivid portrayal of the barnyard rooster in children's literature.This scene is a triumph of the illustrator's art. The use of transparent overlays is superbly done. The reverse side of each ""film"" reveals another aspect to the scene. We see the duck diving in the pond, her bottom in the air. Turn the page and we see what's going on under the water.This classy book has an unashamedly Continental style with an almost earthy flavour. What a great way to introduce children to the ""facts of life"". We see the mating rituals of the farmyard poultry together with cows, sheep and pigs all seen suckling their young.This would have to be one on the most sophisticated ""picture books"" ever published. The text that accompanies the pictures is simple but very intelligent.The vividness of Sylvaine Perols' illustrations will linger in a child's memory for a long time."
5,Very Entertaining,I have met the author of this book & I believe he has seen what he claims to have seen. I found his book very interesting & I hope more things like this are soon brought out to the public.
4,"great product, no problems ordering","great product, no problems ordering, will use this vendor again. I like the tablet version of OPCs vs. other capsule options, the tablets are more stable against moisture, breaking open, etc."
3,Empire Combination Square,"This is a nice square and very accurate. Its major draw back is the numbers are printed backwards & upside down.When reading the square; the lower numbers on the scale (this is the scale most woodworkers use) began at 15 and go backwards. The marks on the top side of the scale began at 1 and go up; however, they are printed upside down. This makes this square very annoying to use."
4,Great intro,"This book provides a great intro to non-standard geometries by creating different axiomatic systems and finding models of them. It then constructs and analyzes operators (addition, multiplication, and the like) on the plane. It devotes a good section to discussing the Desargues and Pappus properties and their fundamentality in most geometries. A good treatise of projective geometry follows, and the book ends with a quick skim of metric geometries and non-euclidean geometries. This is not a good book if you are planning to study Hyperbolic, Spherical or Elliptical geometry, nor does it do a fair treatment of the effects of a metric on a geometry, but it does provide a short, comprehensive intro to axiomatic coordinate geometry."
2,cute little guide,"mine was cut improperly by the machine, so some of the words got cut off and it's pretty unreadable. It's also for kids, not for someone who really wants to learn about spiders. If you're looking for something very informative and interesting, try this book:Biology of Spiders, 2nd Edition"
3,Illustrator Nicholas Strekalovsky,My primary reason for ordering that book was the fact that it was illustrated by my Godfather's father: Mr.Nicholas Strekalovsky. My Godfather was married to my dear paternal Aunt Olga Strekalovsky. Both father and son were enthymologists and Roman Strekalovsky illustrated the 20th century edition of the Encyclopeadia Iranica. I know they were also prolific painters. I own some Paris's landmarks painted by Nicholas. The book seems to answer most questions about spiders.At the moment I am trying to locate the encyclopaedia Iranica but without success. Sorry if my review is so one dimensional.Millie Fowden
3,needs updating,"this book is more of a minaturized field guide,..in size (it's about 6"" x 4"" wide) and in regards to information. there is not that much information but the line drawings help with identifying spiders. i would have liked to see more writen information on the spiders as well as actual pictures. overall for the price it's a nice book to have. i've actually used it several times to identify spiders in my garden."
5,a splendid book,"a superb book--watson, like all of us, is both sinner and saint, an outsized figure blessed with ambition and ego and willfulness. there's a lot of america in ed watson and a lot of ed watson in us."
5,the death of an emperor,"edgar j. watson was voted one of the 50 most important people in the state of florida. he was a pioneer, who built his emipre in florida. he was brave, ruthless, tireless, corrupt and muderous. readers reconize his traits in so many of the empire builders who have followed him to florida. in researching south florida history, it is an honor to know peter and many of the relatives in this book."
2,Drudgery!!,"This book was recommended to me but I found it very difficult to get through and it did not hold my interest. It was good for the historical value of the Keys in Florida, but for me, I didnt look foward to reading each time I picked it up. Having said that, the person who recommended it to me thought it was great."
3,Fictional Retellings,"This trend of interviews serving as a fictional look into a world works well in some places and not so well in others. It works well here in building the legend of Mr. Watson; however, it becomes tedious towards the end of the book and confusing in parts."
3,didn't meet expectations,I found this book to be plodding and tedious and didn't enjoy it as much as other Mattiesen novels. The setting and background information were very well done. But the telling and retelling and telling again of the same event from only slightly different perspectives became tiresome.
3,Lost the plot,"Shame. Matthiessen does not do himself justice with this novel. The plot gets lost as it ends up being repeated over and over, and despite some fine descriptive passages there is not enough to keep the reader interested. Rather than the tension building as the story progressed, I found the opposite to be the case. If it's of any use to anyone I would rate this novel as Balzac without the story. If you like descriptive narrative and don't feel too strongly about a plot then you'll like this book. If not, don't buy!"
3,Story told in heavy Southern dialect,"'T ahll balls down t' this: if readin' fo' hunnert pages of thick cracker drawl don't rasp yo' nerves worser 'n a skeeter whine, y'all will love this here book."
5,As Beautiful as the Woman on the Cover!,Wow! I saw the cover of this book and just had to buy it! Then I read it and wasn't let down. What a beauty!
2,Please don't rate this review,"I use amazons reviews as a diary for how I liked books I read.I see a lot of people here loved this book.I couldn't get through it.the premise sounded wonderful. A woman, looking for her missing sister, with the added spice of flashbacks to another time, almost channeling the past... this would normally be right up my alley.But I found the writing stilted, the characters unwarm and not believable. In short, I put it down after a few chapters and found that I never even cared how it ended. Not exactly a good statement about a suspense novel.(*)>"
3,It does what it says...,"The light is fairly bright and able to give a nice glow to a mid tower, the powerbox is a bit big and took some effort to hide it, my only real complaint is that you will need to purchase some velcro patches yourself as the ones included are cheap and can't withstand a days use. Otherwise very happy."
5,Spectacular guide - won't leave town without it!,"We have used the guide on every Florida trip we take. Living in Orlando, we pretty much know the ropes here in town. We, as a couple, visit other Florida towns (areas) at least twice per month searching for the perfect beach, event, restaurant or attraction. It is great to use the book to find quirkly places to eat and visit. It's been 100% accurate in it's estimations of quality and pricing. We make notes in ours if we find new spots. One day we'll send our comments to the authors!When traveling to Savannah recently, we bought the Hidden Savannah book and were just as satified!I cannot recommend a book any higher! No Chamber or tour guide has been able to top the info in this wonderful guide."
2,Was New York state of mind,"This album was originally 'New York state of mind' availble in Europe and Japan. I guess it was re-labeled after 9/11.Ms. Lee growls her way through the old chestnuts in this album swallowing her ""R's"" in a charmingly Japanese way. Although listed in several magazines as one of the best jazz albums of 2002, it left me cold."
1,What a bust,"While ""Shecky's"" intentions were surely good, this mess of a bar guide is a lame, and often mean-spirited, attempt to be hip.I think what bothers me most is that the putdowns and compliments of the bars and their patrons come fast and furious in a text that apparently has not been proof-read, fact-checked, or even edited. It's impossible to be authoritative when you misspell the name of the bar you're slamming.This enterprise reeks of ambitious New Yorkers who hoped to repeat the success of their book from that city. I sure hope that the writers aren't Chicagoans - anyone who misspells ""Comiskey Park"" and ""Harry Caray"" in the same book would be drawn and quartered in Chicago, where people have a strong bulls**t detector.This book certainly rates highly on mine.There's a little red book that came out a few years ago - THE OFFICIAL CHICAGO BAR GUIDE - that did it much better, quicker, funnier, and more accurate. Let's only hope the brains behind that book decide to update it, and fast."
1,Shecky's is ...,"Ugh. This book manages to take the colorful underworld of Chicago nightlife and make it boring. I agree with the earlier posts that it's mean-spirited and sloppy, and many of the reviews are so off-base it makes you wonder if the author actually visited the bar.But there's good news - the infamous red book (""official Chicag bar guide"") that an earlier poster raved about *has* been updated. I just found it a minute ago. It comes out December 1."
3,Not Spider's Best Work,"I was underwhelmed. I've read everything by Spider Robinson I can get my hands on, and this is NOT his best work. It's okay, but it's not what Spider fans are used to."
3,Pop Up Fly,"I love Spider Robinson, don't get me wrong, his books are like dark chocolate to me. But ever since the Callahan series became a parody of itself and became even MORE popular, Robinson's been trying to write another 'concept' book and mostly whiffing out at the plate.This book has a telepath. The worst sociopathic killer that ever lived. A lonely writer living on an island. An athletic female cop. And a storyline that swings big at a wild premise and just manages to catch enough leather to send it skyward.Seasoned players will tell you baseball is a game of persistence. You can't homer at every up, so quit trying.Spider's had a couple of long balls, and now can't seem to keep his eyes inside the park.It'll come, it'll come."
4,Excellent and fast read,"Spider Robinson writes in an uncomplicated style that is not excessively literary. Like Heinlein, his technical writing is adequate yet what shines about his work is the ideas he presents, not the way he presents them. In a book about something specific he still manages to touch on everything from sex to politics to the ills of society. I recommend it highly."
2,"Shame on you, Spider","First - this book, while given a marvelous base premise, is way too shallow and superficial for what I generally expect from Mr. Robinson.Second, maybe Spider needs to leave Canada's California and move back East. I don't read fiction in order to get politics, liberal OR conservative, shoved down my throat. And Spider's gratuitous poke at Condoleeza Rice was just that - ugly, gratuitous and not what I'd expect from someone who has generally steered clear of politics in his fiction - except for non-partisan excoriations of failure to back space exploration. Furthermore, it was flat out ungentlemanly.Wake up, Spider, or you are going to lose at least one ""faithful reader."""
1,Ugh!,"I wanted to try and give a chance to this man whom I have been seeing his name whenever I open the Stand's Amazon page because though King is my all-time favourite it would be interesting to have a look at the writing of counter-opinion author but...Is this the man who scathed the Stand and King's writing? Better take Creative Writing courses before slashing real talents in publishing world. Then one day he (the author of this garbage) will perhaps learn to write a real novel other than mouthing his political views.Mr. Robinson, if I read the STAND backwards, I am sure it would be more enjoyable than your non-story!"
4,Different than I expected.,"This was quite a bit more down to earth than I expected. I had never read Spider Robinson before and with all the Heinlein comparisons, I expected very sci-fi material. This one isn't, really. It is more Dean Koontz or Stephen King (not horror as much as fantastic) with some Jonathan Kellerman (Alex Delaware novels) thrown in for good measure.In other words, it is a mystery novel with a character that has a supernatural power. Overall, it was a pleasant read and worth checking out. I'm curious to see what his more sci-fi oriented books are like."
2,The author as star,"I did enjoy the actual reading of this book. It's a fun read. When I was done, however, I found myself disappointed. The concept of a suicidal writer teaming up with a telepath and a female cop to catch a psychopath is a good one. The ""suicidal"" part doesn't affect the plot at all, which was too bad because it could have been interesting. The end came too quickly, especially considering all the time he spent on his character battling bureaucracy.The most annoying part about this book was how it was used to beat the reader over the head with how ""marijuana is great"". I don't smoke it and I'm neutral on the subject myself.I expected more imagination from this author."
3,"Just Plain ""mixed up""! But has strong attraction!",This book is just down-right mixed up and wacky. As you stop reading.. you want to read more. And finally when your actually reading you are wondering.. why am i reading this absolutely wacky story?. Then when you hide it back in your bag.. you can't stop thinking about it and you take the book out again to read!
4,A very fine digital recording of the quartets,"Leon Fleisher and the Emerson Quartet had a chance to make a fabulous digital recording of the Brahms F minor Piano Quintet--but they blew it. Instead we get an okay performance that features an overly thoughtful interpretation and frustratingly slow tempos in some spots. This is not an autumnal work, and the attempt by the players to do it that way doesn't work for me. I am not a total fan of the Emerson quartet--I personally prefer the more urgent and less lyrical sound of the Juilliard or Tokyo Quartets. However there is some exceptional playing in the 3 Brahms Quartets. Given the low price and the scarcity of recordings of the Brahms Quartets, I would recommend this 2-disc set."
2,Earth Friendly but not strong,I purchased a case of the Earth Friendly paper towels. This is the first eco-friendly paper towel that I have used. I am not sure if it is indicative of eco-friendly paper towels or not but I was very disappointed at the thickness and strength of the sheets compared to my regular paper towels. They tend to fall apart very easily. It would take two to three times as many Earth Friendly paper towel versus my regular paper towels. It may be earth friendly but you end up recycling a lot more of it.
2,Go with other brands for 100% recycled,"So I don't know if this will get blocked or not because I'm referencing Consumer Reports or not... but I tried to do a lot of research before I bought these paper towels last week. When I got them in, I was... unimpressed. I was deciding between Seventh Generation, Green Forest and Earth Friendly Products. Today, a new Consumer Reports came in, and ranked all 3 of these along with 18 other brands (21 total), and Earth Friendly Products came in last of all 21. Seventh Generation was an alright at number 13, and a product called White Cloud Green Earth, which I'm not sure where to find to purchase, came in at 7, the best of all products that are recycled. So if you can find them, go with White Cloud Green Earth brand!"
4,Acceptable for my needs,"I like that these towels are a smaller size. I prefer the ""select-a-size"" type of towel so that it is easy to take a small piece to avoid waste. These are larger than the half sheets I've had before, but smaller than a typical sheet.They are a thin paper towel, so they can tear when pulled quickly from the roll, but they aren't prone to shredding as some other recycled towels seem to.Personally, I use rags to clean up serious spills, reserving paper towels for small, quick-grab messes and as napkins when someone is running out of the house with food in hand. Someone who cleans heavily with paper instead of cloth might find these too thin and/or small."
2,too flimsy,Towels advertise strength but they are anything but strong. Cancelled recurring order after first one.
5,Amazing sausage!,"It's not cheap but nothing worth it is, this sausage is excellent and the company apparently cares about its customers, it sent Me a complimentary packet of its excellent bratwurst -- very impressive customer service with an excellent product."
1,Weak... barely cuts through a 2X4!!!,"I bought this not expecting much. Much worse than I imagined. Loses charge after a few minutes and can't handle anything over 1/2"" thick without problems. Very disappointed."
4,"Good little Saw, Obviously not a Power House","Obviously people are not going to buy this as a tool to do much, but it is convienient for jobs in odd places where you can't get a real tool. i pulled it out of the box, put a battery in it (purchased seperatly) and cut through a 2x4 with only minimal discomfort. it isn't going to replace any tool, but a nice addition for $17. with softer material this would probably be an even better buy for you."
4,"Not Bad, not bad at all.","For those that know what I'm talking about, this lil' cherrie is worth about three Ryobi trim saws in terms of power, accuracy, durability and ease of use (speaking for the left handed). Vastly exceeded my expectations, owned my unit for three years now, tossed a plywood circ blade into and never looked back. Kinda makes me wish the denali line was still available through amazon."
4,moving target,"This saw works O.K. but it is a little underpowered. It will cut a 2x4 but it will cut slower than many other consumer type 18 volt tools and is easy to stall it out. It also sucks the batteries flat very quick, 10 or 12 cuts and it is about done. Having said that it is still faster and easier than using a hand saw. At $15 or $16 it is a good value. At $30 or $40 you can do better. If you have the batteries and charger from another tool it could be a handy addition for light use, but if you need a saw that will cut 50 or 60 boards, look elswhere. Perhaps I got a bad one, but this is the least effective Denali tool I have purchased. The reciprocating saws and impact drivers work great."
1,-5 Stars if I could,"In fact, I'd give it a -10 stars if I could. I searched high and low for Denali and/or batteries and did not find either. There's NO WAY I'd purchase a tool that I have a hard time finding batteries for, and then have the battery burn out in a matter of minutes. I wish Amazon wouldn't send me the ""Great Deals"" any longer."
2,America's first truly weak album,"After the highs of Hearts, this album was much anticipated. However, it falls far short of their past efforts, with nearly half the album's songs qualifying as poor writing. Perhaps some of this can be blamed on what feels like an attempt to create rocking tunes for their live act. But nearly all those fast paced songs (Jet Boy Blue, Don't Let it Get You Down) are weak or (even worse) cliche. High points include ""Amber Cascades,"" ""Watership Down"" and ""Today's the Day"" (the one hit). Very well produced, as usual."
5,I LOVE AMERICA!,America is definitely one of my favorite bands. I would reccomend any of their CDs to anyone! Also I would definitely suggest seeing them live.
5,Great deal. thanks for the quick ship.,So far it is a really good book. I was very happy with the price and quick shipping. Recommended seller. Thanks again!
4,Difficult,"This is an extremely difficult book to digest, and it is not for casual readers. However, Collingwood's ideas on a meeting of minds between past and present is absolutely fascinating and gets to the true rewards of historical study.The one problem with this book is Collingwood's assumption that everyone can read and understand Greek. He frequently spices up his argument with a pithy Greek word or phrase, but he assumes that everyone can read Greek and never provides a translation. Footnote translations of the Greek words would be immensely helpful."
3,a good start,I think this little notebook is a good start for those family members who are a little more cagey about sharing their past. This will inspire their juices to start flowing so they can remember even more great information about their lives way back when. The pages are so tiny...very small spaces to write in however--which could be good for those who are of little words or bad for those who like to ramble. I got one of these for my father-in-law. I also got 3 of another book. Can't remember which. I got a degree in Family History and Genealogy...I recommend this for start on getting to know someone who may be harder to get info out of. I am planning on adding my own questions and extra little pages for them to write on just in case he needs it.
4,A decent ending to a great triology...,All four (one short story book) of the books in this series have been written very well. Congratulations to Mel. With out giving away too much the antagonist was very exciting; I was usually reading just to get to the points about him. Our Hero on the other hand seemed rather undeveloped during the first two novels. The third novel did slightly better. All in all a great book. I will most definitely buy anymore concerning Jherek.
2,Disappointing,"I had to give this book a bad review because it was a horrible ending to a trilogy that showed promise. Although book 2 should have been edited and made part of this book. Ok let me gripe about this book. It takes forever to reach the the main battle between the hero and the villian but the fight is over in like 5 seconds. Iakhovas worked all kinds of impressive magics, slayed huge creatures, and completed all kinds of other mystical feats to basically be stabbed once or twice and bam it's over. Horrible ending. Also no closure either. After this climatic battle if one would call it theres a whole 2 pages maybe. Plus I have to gripe about Jhereks mystical weapons. They are stupid. Plain and simple."
4,Adrift in the Desert,"In this sequel to When Gravity Fails and A Fire in the Sun finds Marid Audran and his patron Friedlander Bey, framed for murder and sentenced to exile in Rub al-Khali in the Arabian Desert. As in real life, the Rub al-Khali (""The Empty Quarter"") is a vast, uninhabited sand sea, from which no one emerges alive. The bulk of the book takes place there, as they are rescued by a tribe of Bedouin and undergo deep self-examination. The change of setting makes for a nice difference from the previous two books, and there's a bit more character development as well. As is to be expected, the duo make it back to Cairo to unmask the person who set them up and exact vengeance (rather like Stevenson's Kidnapped). Things work out a little too easily for them upon their return, but on the whole, it's another solid entry in the series."
3,Disappointing after the prior two,"Taken by itself, this is a reasonably well-written and reasonably exciting book, but taken as the (albeit unintended) last of a trilogy, it is, as the review title notes, rather disappointing.The first in the series is a can't-put-it-down innovative Raymond-Chandler-derived cyberpunk treasure. The second keeps up the interest and excitement level. In this one, however, the author is much more interested in describing Bedouin culture. There is essentially no cyberpunk flavor and and the plot -- such as it is -- advances very slowly with an excessive number of red herrings. There are many cases of ""well, that seems enough about that let's go on to another thing"" leaving the reader wondering.And, especially in his relationships with his wife, possible 2nd wife, slave-servant, and boss-grandfather we are left with a myriad of never to be resolved hanging threads. I'm sorry I read this one."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Desert revenge.When you are a crimelord the general story is that someone else isn't, and would really like your power, influence, and money.A rival manages to manoeuvre Marid's boss out of power, and gets both of them banished into the desert.A bit of luck as far as who they run into allows them to survive, and begin plotting a return and a helping of vengeance.3.5 out of 5"
4,Great Game if you know where to buy it,"As of the writing of this review the only featured online merchant for Amazon is Target Online selling this for $19.99 plus s/h.You can pick this game up in any Target store on their bargain shelf for $9.99.The fact that some other retailer on here is selling it for $59.99 + s/h is just disgusting.While there is MP for this game, the nuts and bolts are in the SP campains. While there is not a steep learing curve, the game does require attention to objectives and force selection.Throwing a rifle platoon at a T-34 never really works but then again overpaying for a game doesn't either."
5,cute airplane nose ring,i bought this as a joke. last year i fooled my sister with a fake tongue ring this year a nose ring. she's a flight attendant so i thought the airplane was a good choice. it's small and comfortable to wear. It has good detail to it also. i can't wait to use it on her!
4,Music fans...check this out!,"I was excited to finally buy the Radio Disney Music Mix studio, and even more excited to try it out! It was a little complicated to figure out at first. I had to read and re-read the directions, and then fiddle with it for a few minutes before I understood what it did. But once you know how to work the ""controls"" you'll have a blast! You get to choose what kind of music style you want to use. Then, there are three pre-written songs you can use, each with different sounds, beats, and tunes. You can use these, or create your own from scratch. One you have your song, you can record your own voice, plus distort it in different ways. Next you create a music video by choosing from backgrounds, animations, etc. All in all, this game is great...especially for the future star in the family! ..."
2,Oil Filter for Mercedes 2012 C250 Auto,The filter did not fit the auto as advertised and I had to return it and buy a filter from the Mercedes Dealer.
3,Mercedes Benz oil filter,"The oil filter was fine, but it was the wrong filter. The same filter was delivered and returned twice. It appears that the description of the filter was incorrect."
3,1997 - How Much Has Changed!,"I picked up this book in a $2 bargain box in Texas. I dare say it wasn't a cheapie because of the content (I really enjoyed it) but more because it was released in 1997. Due to its age - two things stood out to me so clearly. Firstly, there was no mention of the internet. Not one, and not a website or email address on the contributors contact page - now what a great lesson in how much has changed in just ten years. Secondly, so many of the women profiled spoke of the glass ceilings they had hit due to being women. It made me feel very encouraged to compare this with my own talks with fabulous women in business today where the incidents of ""boys clubs"" are far less.Kirsty Dunphey, author:Retired at 27, If I can do it anyone can"
1,good but............,"I have buy this dvd because Im a Terence fan , I have several records of him , and I expected to see his band in a concert or tour playing something of his last record(flow), but NO ONE SONG IS COMPLETED, all are interrupted . Good or not I dont like it"
5,Great for the price,"I've had these speakers since April or May of 2004. I rarely ever turn them off, as my pc is on pretty much 365 days a year. I've never had any sort of problem with them, they always work flawlessly. The only downside to this set would be the lack of mid-range. This can be solved however, as others have stated, by adjusting the eq with a program. This doesn't bother me, and I assume it wouldn't bother most people as well. I'd recommend this set-up for anyone looking for a well designed system with a lack of desktop space in mind."
5,"Pleasing sound, good value","I'm no speaker expert, but I think these speakers have a really clear, natural sound. The remote with separate dials for volume, bass and a headphone jack is a nice touch. Highly recommended."
4,Glencoe Pre-Algebra Practice Book,"This book is what it is, a good practice book for pre-algebra concepts. The answers can be found in the Teacher Wrap-Around Edition by Glencoe, ISBN #0-02-833241-5. The practice book page, with answers, is superimposed in the appropriate section of the teacher edition."
1,pre algebra work book,"I will have to return the work book, because it was the wrong work book. I was unable to use it."
1,Warning - background music to poems,"The readings seem fine, but for me they are ruined utterly by intrusive background music - some kind of modernistic tinkling on a piano, completely unrelated to the shape of the verse. Crass, insensitive - I wish I hadn't bought it!"
