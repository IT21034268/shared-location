5,"Maybe not groundbreaking, but still an amazing album","Radiohead's latest major studio album may not be as innovative and imaginative as some of their previous work, but then again how many albums are? Simply put, this album solidifies their status as one of the greatest rock bands of the past 20 years."
5,Radiohead's Best Yet !,"It's officially history: if you love music you will love Radiohead. And guess what ? This is the perfect CD. Fourteen classic songs that showcase the talent and creativity of my favourite band. Each song flows like a river, one will be carried to it ! O, and you've got to love the Electrona in it, tant parfait !"
4,tasty radiohead,"I like this album, but I do begrudge is lack of momentum. Its a very good album if you're already in the mood of it, but when I just want to listen to music for the sake of music, rather than mood, this is not the album. However, if you are in the dreary, hopeless mood and just want to soak it up, its great, and comes with plenty of neat sounds and ideas as well, even if I don't feel they're integrated in the most careful or refined manner. Personally, I think I prefer Amnesiac for dreary though, and find that album, potentially because of its thinner textures, more regularly listenable."
4,Amnesiac - Kid A + Ok Computer = Hail To The Thief,"Yet anothor great onei got my copy today and after a listen i can see how they returned to the ""ok computer"" days yet they kept some electronic elements....but not as much as it was in ""Kid A""this one is yet more easy to get into than both ""Kid A"" or ""Amnesiac""There is a glimps of hope and brightness in this album that is not available in the other previous onesthey just keep getting better and better....they grow with each album4 stars cause i liked it better than ""Amnesiac""....yet there is nothing new they haven't done here before"
2,It's okay,"There is a handful a tracks that are good but the majority is filler. Compared to their last three albums, this is dull. Some songs are beguiling as good but are just mediocre with excellent production. But as usual with Radiohead, many of the songs are chilling. But because I have to press 'skip' so many times I never want to put it on. So it collects dust."
1,Amazing Album but Copy Protected,"This album is copy protected so you won't be able to play it on your MP3 player, on your computer (without their software which didn't work for me), on some Car stereos and even on some home stereos!Tell them what you think about this sort of thing by taking your money elsewhere."
5,Where Do We Go From Here?,"Radiohead are doing something pretty strange to music. If you haven't been stupefied by them up to now, this record will push you over the edge. ""Hail..."" is a great record, but where the hell do you look for it in your local Tower Records??That's what I want to know..."
3,A Half Step Back,"I found myself really liking parts of this CD but also scanning forward to get past some parts that just become obnoxious. How would i characterize this CD? Amazing and very progressive in some parts and boreing and bland in others. I want to love this CD but i find myself just sitting, listening, and saying to myself ""God man ... where are you going with this ****?"" I have read some reviewers in Amazon that talk about how this CD is a great mixture between thier rock roots and their recent jazzed out electronic progression, but i disagree. Amnesiac was that CD. This CD sounds more like some tourchered version of that.Bottomline: Is this CD worth buying? Yes ... espessially if you compare it to the rest of the [music] that is being produced in todays mass market media. But Radiohead is capable (or at lest was) of much greater things than this CD and thus i can only give it three stars."
4,I must be losin' it...,"...'cos I think Myxamotosis is by far and away the best track, and others who've commented seem to think its all a bit weird. So many layers, so many conflicting and complementary beats.A juicy bit of work with something for everyone...except all those whiners who want them to do OK Computer all over again (which still wasn't their best album). Anyone who wants to re-live the past glories, buy Christopher O'Reilly's 'true love waits' which is a beautiful mix of the old stuff.The band knew that another Kid A or Amnesiac effort would finally alientate their fan-base (I wasn't taken with either unless I'm listening to them with the other 3 albums on 'random'), so they compromised...and as compromises go, this is a good one.Buy it if you've grown-up with them. If you're still stuck in your old groove and haven't matured, then go get yourselves the White Stripes and re-live your waining youth."
5,A Suggestion,"Get over f***ing ok computer. I do not find any fascination or anything superior, unique, or defining within ok computer. It has some good songs. I do not consider ok computer as anything but a stepping stone toward Kid A and then beyond, in *my* personal interst - in generosity I see it as an INSULAR event, which means you do not expect it twice under ANY circumstances, and do not allow its shadow, if it has one to you, to land anywhere that it does not apply. In this situation it does NOT. Your listening capability is being colored by prior experiece, which is degrading to artistic value, and furthermore a selfish act. It is FINE to draw comparison, it is not okay to put two unlike things on an unbalanced scale.I understand that ok computer may mean a lot to YOU - which I honestly accept, and I have close freinds with this *common* attitude - but christ I'm sick of You telling everyone ""Well, I know I shouldn't compare that record to this one , but..."""
4,Mixed Feelings.,"I will say the same thing about Hail to the Thief that I said about Kid A. When some of the individual songs are left to stand alone, they easily earn five stars. When considered as an album, however, Hail to the Thief is a little choppy in places.2+2=5, There There, and Go to Sleep stand out as benchmarks; songs like the Gloaming and Punchup at a Wedding, though daring and original, do not quite flow with the album as a whole. This being said, the better songs on Hail to The Thief make it a great success musically and experimentally-- but, all things considered, I don't feel it quite reached the five-star mark."
4,Return to Solid,"It is quite true that this is a great compromise for the band in terms of it's artistic ambitions, versus their album's consistency..There is no real filler here, unlike their past two releases..Anything that could have been pure filler, is fleshed out into a song as any true radiohead fan would love to have..The only reason people are simply not blown away by this release is the remarkably high bar the band has set for themselves..As far as consistency goes however, Radiohead hits the mark better then anything since OK Computer..."
3,mediocre,"Very amaturish programming. Just a whole bunch of wish washy songs that would be considered filler if it appeared on a good album. Diehards will give 5 stars for anything radiohead releases so dont trust reviews. It's ashame to see these great artists treading in an area where they are being swallowed whole by groups that have made this type of music for years and years and are so innovative. Radiohead now just follows then, always a few steps (years) behind."
1,more and more indulgent,"It's been six albums now and everybody knows Radiohead by heart over and over again. They've done the rock, they have tried the electronic stuff, Thom Yorke has given us his message. Don't you get tired of it? Don't you think he should move on? (Besides it must be so tiring for the other band members)Hail To The Thief is just another one of these indulgent albums that are completely pointless."
2,Radiohead is way past it's peak,"I'm sorry to see this album come out. OK Computer was the group's best, and they should have left it there. ""Hail To The Theif"" sounds like they were bored when they recorded it and takes the enjoyment out of listening to the few decent tracks with waaaaaaay to much politicizing. (If I wanted to get opinions on politics, I could turn on CNN) Even if you love Radiohead, skip this new (and hopefully last) CD."
5,Another Masterpiece,"Radiohead continues to ignore the rules and instead plots their own course. The overall description of the album could probably best be described as somewhere in between OK and Amnesiac, but don't be expecting OK Computer revisted. This album has it's own distinct, haunting sound. You have to respect these guys for going out and making albums that differ greatly from the Bends and then later OK Computer after the success of each of those two albums. Instead of resting on their laurels and rehasing the exact same sounds Radiohead continues to push the envelope. 10 out of 10"
2,Getting old,"Their problem with self-importance is getting old. I loved The Bends and OK Computer, but I don't see how anyone could be intellectually honest and think this is good. If I want to listen to musical experiments then I'll put on late period Coltrane or Schoenberg. Different or experimental does not equal good. This is not good. Rock experiments usually don't work so I think I'll put on Beggars Banquet."
2,Hail To The Thief,"This album is made more as a piece of art and for expression than for entertainment. If you are a connoisseur of intellectual/unconventional music, or a liberal democrat, buy this album. Otherwise, I wouldn't advise even paying a penny for it."
1,Won't Get Fooled Again,"Speaking for myself I have had quite enough of Thom Yorke's endless mewling and weepy wailing.The Emperor is not only stark naked, he's laughing uproariously at our gullability. While 'critics' leap aboard Radiohead's gladwagon and hail this as yet-another jewel in the groups crown, I've finally exhausted not-only my patience but my pocketbook.If Radiohead were U2, O.K. Computer would be their Joshua Tree and everything after would be the turgid, euro-garbage that has made U2 the despised sellouts they are.Join me and send Yorke and the rest a clear and concise message: We aren't buying your 'brilliance' any more. Keep your bleeps and bloops and crybaby caterwauling, I'll take the latest Foo Fighter disk any day."
1,nothing new,"I was highly disappointed by this album. I do not understand why Radiohead is seen as such an amazing, groundbreaking band.The only thieves I see here are Thom Yorke and co. They started off as imitators of grunge (remember ""Creep?"") and now are imitating Aphex Twin -- from five years ago.You can like them if you like, but this is only innovating because MTV2 wants you to think so.Just buy ""OK Computer"" or ""The Bends,"" it is all the Radiohead you'll ever need."
3,"The bar is high for Radiohead, and this isnt bar level","Some superior songs on this CD but I think the band is reaching the end of the run on a creative crest. The musical stretch from Bends to Amnesiac is such a superior leap blending electronica, rock, and (no classification for some of the music besides Radiohead-ish) that there will be a plateau, or a album that doesnt measure up. This is that album. Another point, (politics aside) I hope they stop encorporating current day politics into thier music, it becomes VERY dated. Nobody cares about the 2000 election anymore, at least there isnt a 'hanging chad' song. Radioheads music should be timeless, no one wants to listen to this and say, oh this was 'that' year, I still listen to Kid A and think I am listening to an album from 50 years in the future."
5,Pleased,The CD I purchased was received timely and it was just as advertised. I am pleased with the purchase and plan to review other iitems.
1,Not worth a cent.,"I made the mistake of getting this book at full price for my spanish class. Trying to follow along with the book's lessons are near impossible, and has not helped me in any way to learn a new language. Not even my professor likes this book."
3,"VERY light, predictable reading","I'm not a huge fan of romance, but I picked this up because I was in the mood for something really light that I could read quickly. This was it. Unfortunately, by the middle of the book I was just overwhelmed by the pure stupidity of the main female character, Maggie. Geez, talk about a complete idiot with NO spine whatsoever. It only got worse toward the end, when her gutless idiocy was the star of the show. Luckily for Maggie, she wandered accidentally back onto Jake's turf making for a happy, predictable ending.If you enjoy novels featuring intelligent, strong female leads, this is definitely NOT for you."
2,Fluff!,"This book is too cutesy for my liking and there are entirely too many coincidences. I'm usually not a big fan of the romance genre, but picked this up on a whim. No one in this day and age is as naive as Maggie are they? No man is as wonderfully sensitive and good looking as Jake ( at least not in my experience). I don't think you should waste your time on this book unless you really like light fluffy romance."
4,A lovely tale of mistaken identity,I couldn't wait to start the novel and I finished it in practically one night. It was a wonderful love story of discovery and family values. It demonstrates the healing role of listening and acceptance (and common-sensical intervention). I wonder what therapists would think of this book's take on psychoanalysis? I prefer Jake Cooper's therapy. It's a novel that I would not mind my precocious daughter reading. And it is one that a 13-year-old boy could enjoy too. I can't wait for the author's next book. The rating system limited me to whole stars; otherwise I would give HANDYMAN 4-1/2 stars.
3,Not what I'd hoped,"I picked this book up because I had read a review in a magazine before it was published and because I liked the basic premise of the pyschologist/handyman mixup. Beyond that, I thought the story was flat."
4,Sweet Read,"I really enjoyed this romance. There was light comedy in the situation, and although a bit far-fetched, it wasn't so much so that it detracted from the story. I liked the writing style and the characters. I really liked the innocence of the two main characters who found themselves in situations/circumstances they could never have imagined themselves in. I admired how the writer conveyed their love and desire for each other, and remained wholesome and clean. Enjoyed how it unfolded, with surprises along the way. I recommend this as a nice, light read."
2,Not what I expected,This book is S-L-O-W! I picked it up because it sounded like a good story. I assumed it would be funny and entertaining but the author spends way too much time writing about her character's thoughts (which are already pretty obvious) and not enough time adding to the plot. I got tired of reading page after page about the past and what the characters were thinking and skipped to the end. No big surprise there either.
1,This is getting interesting,The review from Stephen Nichols reads exactly the same as the one by Linda Tanner Nichols which appeared the day the book was published but presumably pulled recently. What's going on?
5,Just what I was looking for!,I was looking for black knee-hi socks that were comfortable and would stay up without feeling too stiff or too tight. These were perfect. I'd buy then again for sure.
5,Portland Classic Knee High Sock,These knee high socks are well made and stay up with no movement. Glad I found them.
5,A sound depicting time,"A true guitarist is a dying breed, one that needs no respect up front, just a nod of the head will suffice. This man has proved himself over you, and crushed your rib cage in the meantime. Let this be a lesson to other aspiring guitarists. The best track is watermelon, listen to it and ask yourself if fred durst can make you feel like old leo does. Impossible........."
2,CD advertise as multi-channel but it actually stereo 2 channel,"I bought the cd because it advertise as multi-channel but it actually stereo 2 channel only. There's even a sticker on the case read "" multi channel SACD "". Beside that recording sound great."
3,12 strings,Bought based on info from a friend...interesting music but not a 'feel good' album....I find I only play it occasionally...kinda off beat stuff...
2,SACD can't improve bad recording,"A CD in SACD format don't mean it sound good or better...I am very disappointed with this SACD, this is not a up to standard record period. Believe me, I know how a good recording sound like and I have great gears to expose the quality of a recording...I believe all those positive reviews is a result of ""marketing"" at work..."
5,buy this!,"Just bought this after hearing 'Enderlin' (not on here) on the Days of Heaven soundtrack (which is inexplicably out-of-print, don't think it's ever been released on CD). Anyway, this is gorgeous, perfect from start to finish. Get it even if you know nothing about folk guitar virtuosity."
2,one CD disc missing in package,"I left a rating on my order review. There was only 1 disc in the jacket.It says ""2 discs"" in the jacket.I love the music but want the other CD disc."
2,Lower Quality than expected,I have been wearing Rockport shoes for years. I still wear these shoes frequently but the quality is not up to the Rockport name. Within a few weeks of wear the insides started to bubble under the ball of my feet. The looks and the comfort are acceptable but below what I expected from Rockport.
3,just ok compilation,i bought this for DON QUICHOTTE by magazine 60 and the classic SO MANY MEN SO LITTLE TIME by miguel brown if it was the 12''. but it sure wasnt the 12'' of WAKE UP by STOP .it was a horrible short version. CAPITOL TROPICAL by two man sound is good but i'm sure i have that on other compilations like this comp. like most of the rest of the songs.
5,12 in version and 7 inch version on this disc,"12 in. versions as well as 7 in. cuts. They needed a two cd set to include all 12 in versions.I own the 12 in vinyl of many TSR cuts and this disc is nice. Would like to have, ""The roof is on fire"" by Rock Master Scott & The Dynamic Three and the B-Side ""Request line"" on the disc.D.J. Daniel, E.E Mobile Disc Jockey 95136"
5,Rare Laserdiscs-dvds Collector,"I love My Bodyguard,I have THE DVDM'tis A Small Treasure Fun to Watch! Sensitive,Grippin',,Brilliant,lol I'm gonna watch it now,G'bye :PP"
5,one of my favorites,"i remember this movie ever since i was a kid i am 27 now and still love the movie, i am overjoyed to the fact that it is now being released on dvdfirst of all you get ""peachy"", who is super curly,and he moves to a new hotel with his family in a new york hotel which his father runs, ""peachy ""now has to go to a new school where he starts to get picked on by bullies, one is ""moody"", whos a real tough (...) one""peachy ""then gets ""linderman"" (who is a rumered psycopath, and aparently killed his own bother)to defend him and be his bodygaurd against the bullies (who are moody and the much appraised ""mike"" who plays a great role as being a real toughass)""can you pass the salt....im just grabing the salt"" ""whats that? a chain? you think that chains gonna make you tough?""pure humorous fun for the whole family"
4,Solid,"I still enjoy watching this movie as much today as I did 20 years ago. It is a family movie with Chris Makepeace (Meatballs) trying to deal with the high school bully (Dillon). Also, a good performance by a young Adam Baldwin. Featuring Joan Cusack, Martin Mull, Ruth Gordon and John Houseman."
4,Classic film,"I remember seeing this movie in the theater back when I was a kid in grade school when all you had to worry about was getting into a fist-fight with a bully.These days, kids don't get into fist-fights, they shoot each other dead. How much our society has changed!Regardless, this is a movie that everyone can relate to. Who doesn't remember going to a new school, not knowing anyone and feeling out of place? And who doesn't remember the school bully?This film is about growing up and about true friendship and the bond of family. It has humor, excitement and drama and is a movie that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.Keep a special lookout for Ruth Gordon's performance. She is hilarious and heartwarming. What a great actress! Also look for early performances by Adam Baldwin (his first?), Matt Dillon, Martin Mull (whatever happened to him?), Joan Cusack and the legendary John Houseman.It's a great film that is worthy of being added to anyone's collection."
5,The Last High School Movie of its Time!,"This movie is a classic of the early 80s. It gives people a view of rough high school life in an urban area before the introduction of metal detectors and political correctness. The characters are the tough guys you remember in school. They were mean and rough but did not carry guns, did not have body piercing, and did not plan to kill their classmates. Definitely a movie that should be considered the last of its kind and anyone that grew up in this period should add it to their collection.Also, I was fortunate enough to grow up three blocks from the high school where this movie was filmed and actually watched them film it. This Chicago neighborhood has changed quite a bit in twenty years. It went from being a blue collar neighborhood to a haven for yuppies. It is a safer neighborhood and quite a bit more expensive, but has lost all its character. Beware of gentrification; it is not good for everyone!"
5,True Classic.,Such a great film. This one came out around the same time as Ordinary People and both took place in and around Chicago. This film has a very funny and involving story and at times it is heartwrentching. Also look for a VERY early performance by Joan Cusack.
4,An old favorite,"It had always been a favorite of mine so I recently revisited this over the Holiday Season and am glad to say it still is very enjoyable. As many kids did when they were young, I went through having to deal with a bully so maybe this is why I can identify with this movie and understand that getting though High School is hard enough without having to deal with this type of crap.Intersting to see Adam Baldwin, who still works allot, and even Chris Makepeace and Joan Cusack, the former which dropped off the face of the earth and Joan who you still see frequently. Didn't remember Ruth Gordon being in it but she was a joy to see as well. Matt Dillion the heavy in many of films in the 80s does a great job here because I hate him so much. Definitely recommend this to everyone."
4,What a classic!!,"If your looking for a older movie about high school to watch "" My Bodyguard"" is your movie.The movie is based around Clifford, a high schooler who moves to a rougher and old school. While the school bully Moody harasses him relentlessly, Clifford calls upon the mysterious Ricky Linderman to protect him from Moody by being his bodyguard. It works for awhile but Moody retaliates and you'll have to watch the movie to find out how!It draws you into the storyline making you wish there was more. Does Clifford prevail in the end or does the bully Moody defeat Ricky the bodyguard and continue taking lunch money and everything else a bully does! Watch the movie to find out!"
5,A terrific film,"This is a terrific movie. The plot concerns a boy named Clifford (Chris Makepeace) who's new to a Chicago high school. He quickly becomes the target of Moody, the school bully (Matt Dillon). Rather than put up with Moody and his friends, Clifford gets Linderman (Adam Baldwin) to be his bodyguard. Everyone at the school is terrified of Linderman, but he and Clifford become close friends. There are also a few scenes with Martin Mull as Clifford's father, a hotel manager, and Ruth Gordon as his grandmother. It's a very sweet film with superb performances from all the actors. I would recommend it to just about anyone, although there is a little bit of swearing and some mild violence. Overall, though, it's a great film."
5,A really great movie,"I wont go into a synopsis because that has already been done in many reviews here. There really is no bad acting in this movie. It is either good or great. Also, the storyline is very realistic and down to earth which in a way served to make me feel like a silent participant in the film.I remember reading the book in 4th grade which was adapted from the movie. I finally saw the movie some years later and it really was like another viewer said, opening a time capsule. Not only opening a time capsule for me personally, but also a time capsule for life in general in 1980. Tt was a much different world then. Not many movies do that for me. The bad part is it makes me realize how old I am getting and how fast that is happening.Anyway, it is a great movie."
3,Just as remembered,"This is not the best movie in the world. But I remember it when I was a kid, and I still have a warm spot for it. All the stars did a great job in acting in it, especially: Chris Makepeace, Adam Baldwin, Paul Quandt. I just wish Chris and Adam did as well in other movies, and that Paul was in more movies. The story line is simple yet very powerful.I just wish they coded the DVD with an enhanced picture and sound."
4,Perfect for my needs,I wanted a speed (waterskiing) boat to use on a display for a 50th wedding anniversary party. This boat was the perfect size. To my delight (as well as all of the children) it also works. Seems pretty durable but has not had much use beyond the display.
4,Inspiring book,"I expected this to be a book, which would reveal all the secrets of Kenyan runners and take my own running to another level. I was a bit disappointed at first but when I started reading it more I found it very inspiring. It teaches you how crazy actually the Kenyan runners are with their training. This book does give training examples of what the Kenyans do but they are more like just ""samples"" of the training and it's hard to get a big picture. If you want to learn the secrets of Kenyan runners, forget it -- there are no secrets. These guys just train so hard that it would be a wonder if they wouldn't be world class runners. If you want find out what it takes to be a world class runner, this book could be your choice."
4,no pain no gain,"This book is specific for get what you want. Its take you carefully and precisely over the road and goes on over other complementary topics like nutrition for runners and the psychological strength you must develop. its let something very clear, NO PAIN NO GAIN, so train hard for reaching your goals."
5,Reggaeton Lovers Paradise,This is one of the best Reggaeton albums I have ever heard. Every song is a winner. I listen it everyday and haven't gotten bored or tired listening to yet. Luny Tunes Rules!
3,Sounds like pop to me...,"Ok so I bought this CD expecting another great production from Luny Tunes. I have mas flow, la trajectoria, mas flow 2. They've never let me down until...now...This production feels waayyyyy too much like pop music. I really don't think it's Luny Tunes but more the direction that Reggaeton is taking. I'm really not liking it. Whatever happen to el tigeraje, el tirareo'? This album does have some heavy hitters but I guess I'm just not feeling it. And oh yeah one more thing what in the hell were they thinking when they put RBD on there. Tisk tisk tisk... *shakes head*"
2,Luny Tunes are turning Reggaeton into Pop,"This album sounds to much like Pop music than hardcore Reggaeton. They even have that RBD boyband in this piece. A few years ago LT saved Reggaeton with their producing skills now it looks like they set out to kill the monster they created with this embarrasing album transforming a music of the streets into the music even Grandmas like and that is scary. The only reason for the two star is because the zion and the arcangel & de la ghetto songs. If you wanna hear some real Reggaeton look for producers like DJ Memo, Meka, Mambo Kings, DJ Wassie & DJ Fat this dudes are doin it right and keepin Reggaeton Calle my friends"
3,Save your money.,"I bought my Char Broil Quantum Grill planning on converting it to natural gas. I read that you could do the conversion yourself easily. I found directions on the internet on how to drill out the gas jets. I'm a do-it-yourself person but this didn't sound like a great idea. So I bought this conversion kit. It was easy to install and it works fine that gets it 3 stars. Why only 3 stars?Here's what's in the kit: a gas hose with quick connect, a wrench, decorative valve bezels and directions. It turns out that the Char Broil Quantum ""dual fuel"" grills are built for natural gas and they add little fittings to convert them to propane. You lift out the burners, use the wrench to remove the little brass fittings, put the burners back on and hook up the gas hose. Done. I could have visited my local hardware store and done it myself safely for about $10.Don't get me wrong, I love the grill and the kit works fine but - save your money."
4,Charbroil 4584609 Natural Gas Conversion Kit,"Ordering was easy.Received it promptlyThis kit worked well as advertised, but it shouldn't be that expensive!Charbroil 4584609 Natural Gas Conversion Kit"
5,Frontispice,"un ensemble de pièces peu jouées pourtant de haut niveaunotamment ""frontispice"" pour cinq mains qui superpose des pulsations contradictoires passionnantes"
1,Tell a lie often enough..........,"It amazes me that after 90 years there are people still trying to revive old anti-German propaganda myths from WWI. All these supposed attrocities were investigated after the war and found to be totaly false.Even the Belgian government,when it investigated the allegations made in the infamous Bryce Report,couldn't find any evidence to support the stories.And I think you will have a pretty tough time trying to convince people that the Belgians were covering up for the Germans!"
3,penned as the first book on the Dungeons & Dragons world,"It was interesting, but not that well put together. I did want to finish the book, but attempting to tie in the ""real"" world with the roll-playing fantasy could have been better. It was a fun read."
4,Not 5 stars but pretty good,"Like the title says the emphasis with this DVD is cardio. There are 3 main workouts that can be done separately or together, plus a Yoga-like warmup and cool-down. The first uses no equipment and with the warmup lasts about 33 minutes, the second is done with a 15 lb kettlebell and the third with a 10 lb kettlebell. These two sections are short, about 12 minutes, but test your endurance. There is never a break to catch your breath which keeps your heart rate up the entire time. The movements are all vertical, so up and down a lot which really works your buns and legs, but not much rotation and no ab work. While I didn't like the lengthy warmup I really enjoyed the cool-down. Overall not bad, but if I really want to work my muscles with a kbell, I use Angie Miller's Kettlebell Bootcamp."
1,Probably not the whole story,An aggresive athiest sudenly becomes a believer and goes into the church! The silly woman must clearly had a silly husband. One suspects this book is an advertisement for godhuggers.
5,Finally a way to actually change your behavior.,"I've not only read the book but also experienced the process. Mr. Lefkoe's book gives you the developmental history of the Decision Maker process, an explanation of how it works and several pertinent case histories.He explains how our beliefs, typically created when we are children, have us experience the world as we do and how our behaviors are manifestations of these beliefs. The good news is: Given that we create our beliefs, we also can eleminate them thus freeing ourselves to ""be"" in the world differently than before.He goes on to explain where the process can be used and how our institutions, government and world can be truly changed.The book is a quick read with excellent case histories that allow the reader to ""relate"" to the person being facilitated and also understand how the process works. It's logical!The book promises, and I can tell you from first hand experience that it delivers"
5,AN INSPIRED GUIDE TO CREATING LASTING LIFE CHANGES,"Kiss your therapist goodbye! Morty Lefkoe's simple yet profound Decision-Maker Process takes the reader from identifying to transforming limiting beliefs in a few easy steps, guiding them in creating new beliefs which support lasting postive change. Once you realize it is the underlying beliefs that keep desired changes from becoming permanent (despite knowing what's good for you or talking to your therapist about it endlessly), generating an empowering new belief is a logical methodology from which to create one's life. Given how what we believe shapes our world, there is no doubt that this book and it's technology can make a difference for all types of readers. I highly recommend it!"
4,"Poor little lambs, have you lost your way?","""You are all sheep."" With that opening sentence, one can't help but be drawn in to this perplexing and often profound book on Learning To Love God In The Way We Think. Sire recommends beating your head against the wall, taking prozac, and watching wrestling, Jerry Springer and all the bad sitcoms on TV.

5,ABBA's Past and Present Brought Together,"As a new fan of ABBA's music I bought this DVD after getting ""ABBA-The Definitive Collection"" on both a CD and a DVD. The ""Super Trouper"" DVD shows ABBA during their Australian concert and during their 2004 reunion, minus Agnetha, in London during the opening of ""Mamma Mia."" At first I didn't think I needed this DVD since I had the other one listed above, but I took a chance and bought it here on Amazon and am thrilled with the contents. If you enjoy ABBA's music, or if you are not yet familiar with their songs, you will enjoy the past and present of ABBA's career come together in this DVD. I can't imagine you being disappointed."
1,Bad pruchase,This product was all over cracked and broken. If i had the chance I would seek a refund. I wish amazon should help me address this iusse. I am ready to supply the data to proove my case instead of making a false cliam. I hope somebody should help and get my refund for me.Customer
2,Super Troupers review,Too much conversation mixed in with tunes .A concert DVD should be music performed on stage with conversations at the end as an extra
3,Never a great group but an OK movie,"Except for ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Fernando,"" ABBA never caught in in the USA. They were insanely popular in Europe, Australia, Spain, etc. Most Americans found their brand of Euro-pop to be adolescent. Many of the melodies were no better than what you hear in children's songs. Strip away the production and you have very spare music that can sound clunky to US ears. In this movie, Benny even admits that there isn't much to their international hit, ""The winner takes it all."" It consists of nothing but two musical phrases - one repeated three times and one repeated twice. If you have ever tried to play ABBA on a guitar, it is embarassing how monotonous and simple their songs all sound (except for the more complex ""Dancing Queen."" I was never a fan. All that being said, this is an interesting movie, with clips from the sixties from Swedish tv that are fun to watch. This is a well-done documentary."
4,A must have for any true ABBA fan!,"I've been a fan of ABBA since the 70's. I grew up with their music.I rediscovered them in 2006 and enjoy their happy and simple music as much now, as I did over 30 years ago. More than a sentimental attachment, ABBA was truly a great and pioneering pop music group. They suffered the misfortune of existing during the early 70's to early 80's, when rock music was more prevalent.I own another ABBA documentary DVD which goes from their beginnings to 1999. This one continues up to 2004, for the five year anniversary of the hit musical ""Mama Mia"". There's more coverage of live ABBA performances in this documentary. It's a worthy addition to the collection of any true ABBA fan. To me, ABBA is the greatest pop music group ever."
3,"abba,s :super troopers:","i thought the dvd would be abba in concert singing all their songs. instead it was a history of how the group got together and disbanded.there were excerpts of the band with parts of numerous songs but it wasnt what i wanted. there should be more information on the contents of the dvd,s. i hope this message will help others make a decision to buy or not to buy.."
2,"More Music, Please","This is probably great for the ABBA fan who wants to learn about the group, but if you are wanting a video of them doing what they do best, you will probably be disappointed. The DVD includes too much stuff that is not ABBA performing. The bits and pieces of their performances that are included are good, but I had hoped for more of a ""concert"" DVD."
3,Does the Job,"Price was good. The driver didn't even have the 8600 or chocolate as an option for the installation but I somehow got it to work. The cable also lacked the ability to charge the phone. I don't know how much they saved be excluding the feature, but it was something I was not happy with because I intended on using it in my car as well in conjunction with my ipod usb car charger."
2,Review,Havent really used it but attempted to as soon as i recieved it. Not too sure how it works...its not showing my phone on any of the software programs (after i hook it up using the USB cable).
3,A tricky product.,"I downloaded the drivers from Verizon but computer did not recognize the USB cord and reported ""Unknown Device"". Finally got it to work after unplugging and replugging the cable into the phone and making sure that the cable is straight. I would advise just to keep playing around with the cable and the angle in which you hold your phone."
1,Junk,"First off, the picture is not what you get. Cable basicly came in a sandwich bag with a cd of drivers, none of which were for the VX8500 or VX8600. I could not get the provided drivers to work with my 8600 and called the company who sent me a link to other software that again was not for my phone. I finally got the cable to work with drivers I was able to find with a google search, but it works intermittently as the cable makes a very poor connection to the phone. I have to keep moving it until it makes connection and then try and hold it in that position."
3,lg 8600 usb,"i thought it would be as easy as plugging it in to my phone, but i guess this technology isn't as advanced as it should be. i had problems with the install. eventually got it to work but still have some issues."
1,Complete Junk!,Cable was obviously poorly made because I could not even plug the usb cable into my laptop. I had to keep unplugging it and inserting it again for my computer to even recognize it.
2,"OK for a wall decoration, I guess...","But it cost me $35.00 to set up and it will NOT stay in tune. You get what you pay for, I guess..."
4,Disappointed,"The product is great, for the price payed and taking into consideration that my kid grows fast, I didn't want to invest more money. But the seller.... I send them 4 emails and none of them was answered.. even once!!!! on the tracking it said the product was returned to the seller... no one answered my emails.... the tracking system then stated that again was coming to my place.... almost a months passed!!!! and no one still answered my emails and the violin did not arrive... I contacted Amazon and they told me that the responsible for that was the seller, and that as far as they were concerned (amazon), the product was returned and the seller will refund my money.... I was almost buying another one, with another seller of course!! when the original violin arrived!!! almost one month after and having my kid lost 2 classes because he did not have the violin.The violin as the teacher stated it is ok, and it is of a good quality.. but the seller.... I was very disappointed!!"
2,"beautiful, but not for anyone without training","Really nice, attractive, well built violin, with a really good case. I bought it for my grandson, who loves any kind of musical instrument. It was way to hard for him to play. It had no instructions either. One would need to take some serious lessons with this to make any kind of music (or sounds) with it."
2,way to long,"I LIKE THE FACT THAT THIS BOOK TAUGHT THE LESSON THAT THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON. I LIKE THE WAY THAT SASS HANDLED HERSELF WITH THE WOMEN THAT WERE AFTER CHRISTOPHER. I ALSO LIKED THE WAY THEY COMMUNICATED THEIR FEELING MOST OF THE TIME. HOWEVER, I FOUND THAT THE BOOK LACKED SUBSTANCE BECAUSE IT WAS 398 PAGES TOO LONG. SASS WAS INDECISIVE FOR TOO LONG AND HER SECRET WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY THE STORY. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I FINALLY FOUND OUT WHAT IT WAS. MAYBE IF THE BOOK WAS SHORTER IT WOULD HAVE HELD MY INTEREST, BUT I FOUND MYSELF CONTINUING BECAUSE I HATE STARTING A PROJECT AND NOT FINISHING IT."
2,too long and too detailed,"I am really trying to complete this book, but boy is it hard. I'm on page 2XX and still nothing. I think the plot is fine, but the story is too long and too much about nothing. I like the different worlds and cultures expressed in the story, but once Sass and Kristopher get together, the celebration of their union and Sass' fears are reiterated over and over again for at least 200 pages or so. Another anoying thing that really bothers me is that...the audience can assume that everyone gets up and is clothed and fed. My goodness! I hate to read details like what the characters ate for breakfast or the details of how they got dressed or which road was taken to get from one town to another. Too detailed. The book was also a little sappy with the ""you are my universe and I'll chase you to the moon and we'll sail together through the hemilayas"" lingo. I just didn't enjoy it as much I've enjoyed some of the other books written by Ms. Hudson-Smith. Sorry-"
3,Ok but could have been better,"I enjoyed the story between Sass and Kristopher but one of my huge problems was that Kristopher did not appear to be believable. Not only was he not believable as a man who had scorned Sass in the past, she was not believable as a once scorned woman. She gave in too fast then gave up just as quickly. She appearned to have mental problems. I did enjoy finding out the mystery concerning her past with Kristopher. This was the only thing that kept me interested and not able to put the book down. And in the end I sure was surprised. The romance could have been alot better."
1,Way too long,"I just finished this book, and I'm sorry to say I had to force myself to read it. I normally get through a romance book in a week. I just don't like this author's style of writing, and I don't see myself trying to read any more of her books. I may put mine up for sale."
2,To much time wasted!!!!!!!,This is one of the worse books I have ever read. The main character does nothing for the image of african american women. She is very weak and to caught up in her own self pity. The author spent so much time trying to be descriptive the plot of this story is lost. I had to force myself to finish this book.
2,Trance/Techno music 90's,"There's only one song I like out of this CD,other then that the repetitive beats are too long & a bit boring. Sorry. :("
1,Don't bother!!,I have see other TROMA pictures and for the most part they were OK but this thing really stinks mid-eighties trash no story and the audio was not hearable even at max. volume settings 1 star because you can't go any lower.
3,Paul,The book was fine. It was not what we were looking for. More about the book would maybe have helped us see it was the wrong one. The book was in excellent condition.
4,A behind the scenes once removed,"I found Piers Bizony's book fascinating and I'm continually amazed at the work this film achieved for its day (and today in many respects). It defined the genre. It's filled with great stills, diagrams, and behind-the-scenes photography of the filmmaking process.However, if you're looking for a book that gives you an inside peek on the filmmaker and his decision making process for the story (or authentic insight on the story itself), you'll be disappointed. 2001 is a complex storyline with metaphore upon metaphore and the Bizony never seems to achieve a 'true' account by Kubrick on the film's meaning. It's more guessing, speculation, and hypothesis that add to the voices weighing in regarding this important film. I suppose in some respects, it adds the mystery and weight of story... and will remain that way with the passing of Kubrick in 2000."
2,Tranquility chamomile,NO was not happy when I opened my package!! The PICTURE that was DISPLAYED when I ORDERED was that of the old product called TRANQUILITY what I received was the new product called TRANQUILITY CHAMOMILLE.That was quite deceitful buy the seller and was false advertising! Anyone who has used the old product knows it is not the same. BEWARE if you are looking for the old product contact seller and make sure that is what you are getting!!!
4,pillow case,"I was very pleased with my Penguin pillow case. It is a nice size. The material is very sturdy, and seens like it will hold up to much use."
4,Bring out the bourbon.,"This fourth and final volume in the Cocktail Mix series features swinging soundtrack recordings from 1958 to 1968. All tracks are instrumentals, with the exception of ""Come Live With Me"", which is sung by Tony Scott. It is a fun album that should appeal to fans of ""adult pop"" from the '50s and '60s."
3,It will make you seem very hip,"The opening is so classic. The theme to Man and a Woman comes on and I just want to buy a yuppie old-style Saab convertible and play it on repeat. My other favourite track is ""Come live with me"" that contains the most impossible lyrics, it makes me laugh every time. ""Lolita Ya Ya"" reminded my old roommate of some kind of cartoon character and it is rather insane albeit fun. It will impress your friends that you bothered to buy this, but I personally prefer the album Martini Madness."
1,Same Album #3,"Just like Negative Format's first 2 albums, this new one is just the same song over & over & over again. The only difference this time is that the song titles are far more computer-geek related. Someone's been watching ""The Matrix"" & ""Bladerunner"" a little too often by the looks of it. The vocals are little more than cliche themed spoken word processed through lots of computer sounding distortion and no song has any obvious verse/chorus hook to it. This EBM band continues trying to convince people that it's Trance now, but that's not the case at all. Even the most generic instrumental Trance has more musical punch & catchiness to it than this does. If you enjoy unimaginative background music whipped up on a laptop computer, then you may like this. If you're looking for any sense of creation, structure or substance, skip it."
4,Oh it works alright.,"Yep it certainly works. And that's what counts.A small food fire in my toaster oven could have got out of hand. Flames were licking up to the cabinets above.I had this extinguisher handy, and it put the fire out just like you want.BUT WHAT A MESS.I think this is true of all dry chemical extinguishers.I spent 2 days cleaning the kitchen. The powder is probably not good to eat, so I had to make sure to get rid of every trace. DO NOT apply heat (oven self-clean is a big no-no) to get rid of this stuff.If you can afford it, get Co2 or FE-36 (inert gas) extinguishers. However these cost 10 times as much.If you don't expect a fire (who does?) this does the job. But there will be a mess."
3,OK,"My plan was to use this book to get ideas for things to do in our wedding. My husband and I both have been married prior and each have children from our first marriage. The book was helpful in some ways and way off base on others. It talks a lot about feelings of family and friends, things to expect and not to expect such as showers, parties, gifts, announcements, etc. It also talks a little about suggesting ways to incorporate prior family connections such as the ex-mother-in-law that you adore, etc. Good book for those who don't have a clue how to proceed, not so good for ceremony ideas."
3,"Shake that nasty thing you nasty, nasty girl!","Foxy Lady isn't as unique as Supermodel of the World, but it does have it's high spots. The CD starts off with some basic boiler plate dance tracks but then the Foxy Lady track starts and the old Ru rears her head once again. From here on out it's the sassy, brassy and always classy Ru Paul doing her thing with style! Unfortunately nothing here reaches the heights of Supermodel, Back to My Roots or A Shade Shady, although R.U. Nasty, Work That Body and Dolores come close. I especially like the guitar work on Dolores, it has a nice Spanish feel. Celebrate is a terrific dance song that will get most everyone moving and should've been a larger hit. But mostly, if you're not a Ru Paul fan you probably will not be that satisfied. For fans though this is a 'must own'. With only 2 Ru records to choose from you gotta have 'em both!"
1,Broke First Time I Used It,"Very inferior. The off switch collapsed into the handle the first time I used it. Returned it for a refund.A far better product of this type is the Conair BC84JCS Instant Heat 3/4 Inch Hot Brush for $12.99, also available from Amazon."
4,Full of Pleasure,I bought this CD having read a fantastic review of it in Time magazine. It was a very good decision. Ms. Mekeba is a jem. African music comes full circle by way of Ms. Mekeba's splendid voice. I encourage you to embrace this brilliant and profound collection of songs.
5,"MODERATELY ""lite"" MAKEBA ALBUM","Lovely cd. Favorite tracks: Lindelani, homeland, pata pata... This cd is beautiful. Makeba's rich mature voice overwhelms and instrument, so it is nice there's at least one song of her w/ only percussion & light background. Some of the songs slightly ""lite rocked"" world music, but the wonderful vocals almost make that disappear! Believe me, I detest lite rock world music, but it's a great album. If you like more home grown and less synth try her Africa album. MANY wonderful tracks. Also, the case is wonderfully done and the words are printed for all the songs. (just nice to know!)"
2,Nothing Special,"I need to put the brakes on some of the out-of-control rave reviews for this book. The plotting and prose are pedestrian, which is to say about as exciting as watching someone take an afternoon stroll. Yes, it's set in New Jersey, and it's not an awful book, but it has nothing to do with the wonderful insanity of ""The Sopranos"" or the bittersweet intensity of a Bruce Springsteen song. Harry Rane misses his wife and his job and drives around his niche of the Garden State in search of meaning, even if he doesn't say it in so many words. Then he gets involved in the troubles of a childhood friend, which leads to further complications involving an old lover, the consequences of which are obvious to anyone who's ever read a mystery/crime novel. Which is what pretty much lets the air out of any tension Stroby's set up; when you're that far ahead of the character, it's difficult to be engaged."
3,Mildly entertaining Crime Novel,"Although I was not totally displeased wth this book, I must say I was expecting more.I would probably read this writer again, but wouldn't go to any special trouble seeking out another of his books. I chose ""Barbed-Wire Kiss"" because it was a crime/mystery novel, but found that it dwelt a little too much on ""romance"". The ""love""story seemed unbelievable and trite."
1,Do NOT Buy This Item!,"I purchased this item because I am on the field with Soccer and Little Leagues all the time. I used the amplifier 1 time only. I could not turn the volume up all the way because of the squawk noise. At the end of the day the on/off switch, cheap plastic, had stripped and would not turn off. We got that fixed, put new batteries in and the connection started smoking and smelling like burnt plastic. Hooked it up to the A/C adapter and it worked just again, but out on the soccer/baseball fields this is going to be a really LONG extension cord. 8-( She says with sarcasm. Useless product, complete waste of time and money."
5,Farmers Daughter,"As always, Kevin Williams was just fantastic. He just gets better & better. The world needs more truly wonderful guitarist like Kevin."
1,former fan...,"There was a time for me that when a Landsdowne regency was coming out, I would count the days until I could run out and buy it. Then something happened. The Nightingale series came and with it, for me anyway, went much of the joy and just plain fun I used to find in Judith's novels. It is funny how many of the reviewers for this book say Judith Lansdowne is back which is an indication, I think, on just how many of her devoted fans feel that she has left in the first place!! Just in Time just is not that intereting a story and really lacks in the romance department. I do not mind the 40-something romance. But the real romance and fun that can be found in some of her best books, The Bedevilled Duke, Annabella's Diamond, Balmorrow's Bride and Camilla's Fate, is missing. These books could be read over and over again and still enjoyed. I hope that I too someday can say She's Back!"
3,Not my favortie,OK for a very young child or baby. The pictures are not overly captivating and do not demonstrated the story clear enough to teach with out further explanation. I was a little dissapointed when we read it the first time.
5,Great familiar objects for nearly-talking toddlers,"My son loves the objects in the book. Many of the objects are familiar to his (shoe, ball, flower, mouse, etc), so they reinforce the words he is trying to speak.Great for age 18 months - 2.5 years, perhaps older(?) Just a fun book that encourages exploring the world and enjoying everything the day might have to offer. ""What are we going to do today?"" (In the context of ""Let's find something FUN to do!"")So much fun!"
4,Analog Playground,"Songs from the Analog Playground is one of the better modern jazz albums I've heard.It features a few solid guest vocalists along with some great playing by Charlie Hunter and his band. Each of the guest vocalists bring a uniqueness with them and they make their song special.The vocalists help keep the album from getting too repetitive and boring. Norah Jones, Kurt Elling, Mos Def and the lead vocalist from the band Galactic do about two songs each. There are also some straight-ahead instrumentals.The entire cd is filled with very good music. It's very laidback, jazzy and grooving.I would recommend this Cd, even to people who are on the fringe of being jazzheads because it has that universal musical appeal. Good stuff!"
5,Charlie's new albums great,"THis new album is awesome, i love the diversity he is able to reach on it. The singers bring a real spice to hunters already mindblowing music. This album like most of his in the past does not disappoint as it is quite different from all the past charlie albums... id say that this is his best album yet... you should all definitely check it out"
5,The Rockumentary of The Who.,"The greatest rock movie about the gratest rock band of all time. See this video and you will know why. The so-called ""shock"" groups of today should see ""The Kids Are Alright"" to see how it is supposed to be done."
4,DELUXE OR SPECIAL EDITION,"When i saw the dvd in store,i did not know there was a special edition with another disc,so i made a mistake of buying the DELUXE edition.I had seen the film years ago and i must admit that they did a fine remastering job.The complete A QUICK ONE WHILE HE IS AWAY is the most welcomed addition.This was the prelude of their rock operas.When in good form,THE WHO were the best group of their era in live performances.Apart from WHO'S NEXT,they were never as good at making records.This group only came alive on stage.This is what PETE actually says when he admits that he is another person on or off the stage.The anarchic spirit made the group unique,but also killed their drummer KEITH MOON, who could not stop the teenage wasteland syndrome.This film was actually made by a fan of the group who understood them,and it shows when they perform WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN in the end.Don't forget to buy the SPECIAL EDITION"
5,"Get it now, you'll thank me later!","I saw The Who in November, 2006. I was not expecting much from these dinosaurs of rock but I was extremely impressed. They still got it. Go get it. This is the standard bearer for all rockumentaries."
5,WHO'S GREAT?,"The WHO is the greatest rock band ever. Some people say the Stones or Beatles or Led Zeppelin and I LOVE all of this great bands to. But for me the real Greates Rock band ever is The WHO and this GREAT DVD profs it to any one who whuld dissagre. No one will get dissapointed with this Fantastic Classic rock movie it's simply awsome. And all the extra stuff are realy great 2. buy it, you know you whont it."
5,Best Who DVD,"This film is great! Never a dull moment in the history of maximum R&B.;This retrospective is so fast moving, that it leaves you begging for more.The Who are the original punks, and this movie showcases how seriously funny,and uber-talented these music personalities are and where."
4,"Great movie, the video is a chop job!","Anyone who digs the Who digs The Kids Are Alright. The MOVIE isn't the problem here. The editing of the orginal movie for VHS release created a VERY incomplete version of what was. The mini-opera A Quick One While He's Away is cut by two thirds. The tape also contains other ""shells"" of great tunes and live performances. In short, the movie was severely tampered with when edited to tape and whoever did that is not only fooling the buyer, he's falsely marketing tampered artistry! Boo! I want the complete movie, occaisionally aired on late nite cable!!"
5,This is THE ONE!,"Rock & Roll = The Who = This DVD!It MUST be heard in DTS or Dolby 5.1 -- LOUD. Two speakers in front is just not good enough. The ""new"" recordings are visually and sonically the best rock and roll recording and presentation I have ever heard -- including many live concerts!Thank you Jeff Stein!!"
1,What's Up with The Who DVD's?,"...That's available in the UK, but with only stereo audio... I will say that the ""Tommy"" DVD has stunning 5.1 audio, using the original ""Quintaphonic"" mixes..."
2,Boring.,"I picked this up based on my memories of watching it many years ago and I was disappointed by how boring I found it. Sure, the footage was kinda cool in spots, but as a film it just has not aged well. There is far better footage circulating amongst collectors which leads me to believe that a much better movie could be made. If you are a rabid Who fan (which I am not) then you will love it....if you are looking to relive the thrill of what you experienced when you saw it ""back in the day"" then it might not be for you."
1,The Kids Aren't Alright,"The only thing this film has going for it is its sentimental value. This film showcases some of the last great performances of the venerable Keith Moon. Both Moon's fantastic drumming and Daltrey's famous blood-curdling scream on ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" are classic pieces of rock history. The likes of which will never be seen again.Keith Moon was not only rock's greatest drummer but he was also one of rock's funny men. Moon always had a quick wit about him and you can see some of that in this film. Unfortunately, you don't see enough of it.Aside from its sentimental value, ""The Kids Are Alright"" doesn't have much going for it. The film is choppy and disjointed and its quality leaves something to be desired. If I didn't know better, I'd say Jeff Stein put this film together in his garage.If you're a true Who fan, you may want to rent this video for sentimental reasons. But even then, I'd still be reluctant to rent or buy this movie because it's a BIG disappointment."
1,mistaken purchase,"It was my mistake, but, I wanted THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, not THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT. I bought the wrong movie. I have not even viewed this one. UGH!!!!!"
1,(Beware) The One DVD That Will Not Play,"I have purchased this DVD twice,and each time it would not play.Naturally the store didn't believe me the second time so I got stuck with a DVD that will not play!99.9% of my DVDs (including retals)play.My player is a Sony......................Beware of this lable and anything put out by it!!!!!"
5,"""My Friends Call Me Keith, You Can Call Me John!""","This is one of the best documentaries of rock and roll- ever! I enjoyed the interviews (John claims now he's got money and too old to enjoy it; Pete warns people not to come to close to him while performing or he'll ""probably kill you"", and Keith chats with Ringo Starr). I enjoyed the videos (Happy Jack and the obscure Cobwebs and Strange- the latter featuring a killer drum solo by Moon the Loon, of course). I agree I was disturbed by them only including part of ""A Quick One"" (they also cut out an eyepatched Keith Richards' introduction). Then of course, the highlight is the performances- ""My Generation"", ""See Me Feel Me"" (Woodstock), ""Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere"", working in the studio on ""Who Are You"", and Keith's final performance with the Who ever- ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" closes the show. So long, Keith, we miss you."
3,"I'm a huge Who fan, and could not wait to see this again.","However, I think my memory of the movie is better than the real thing. Glad I got it and saw it again. I'm not sure paying for Blu-ray was worth it though."
5,This DVD is Alright!,"I've had this DVD for two weeks and I am very pleased, especially with the 2nd disc Special Features. I like being able to isolate the ""Bass"" line on two songs and changing camera angles. While my family had lived within earshot of the 1967 Monterey Pop festival, I didn't know much about ""The Who"" until I saw this movie. I viewed ""Tommy"" and ""The Kids Are Alright"" as a double feature in Seattle. Every time the WHO appeared on the screen, the audience would jump up and yell (especially when the film broke during ""Tommy"")! I remarked to the woman sitting next to me that ""I'd never been in a riot before."" The recent commercialization of The Who's music (The CSI TV Shows, Hummer Commercials etc.)reminded me how great they were, so I ordered this DVD. I am not disappointed. The clearity of the picture and the stereo sound is great and there's no film to break or video to fade!"
2,The Kids are Alright??? Maybe??,"Does anybody know if the DVD version is chopped up/edited like the VHS????????? A Quick One is one of the highlights of the film, I can't believe it was atrociously tampered with. :("
5,Alive in 2009,"I have this movie on laserdisc, and it is one of my favorite rock videos. The live performances of the WHO at their peak are unforgettable. The interviews are funny and short, and serve as the perfect lead-in to phenomenal rock. Keith Moon will live forever through these songs. I only hope that Amazon and I am still clicking on January 1, 2009!"
3,Edited Quick One knocks 2 stars off,"TO THE POWERS THAT BE: If/when this is released on DVD, PLEASE PLEASE do not edit A Quick One (recorded at the Stones R&R Circus Show). It was easily one of THE highlights of the film when I saw it during its theatrical release. I will not be purchasing this title until it is included and hesitate to recommend to others (especially big time Who fans). Listen to it on the soundtrack album and just picture what you are missing."
5,WOW !,"I have a friend who watched this DVD recently one night . He suffers a bit from sleep-disorder. He says he had absolutely NO chance of sleeping after the undiluted deluge of adrenaline which is the Who on this album. It makes contemporary acts seem lifeless, over-rehearsed, calculated, calculating and inhibited.Not these guys. Man oh Man!"
5,A Must -Have!,"This movie is a must-have if you love rock and roll! Bands like The Who, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Led Zepplin changed the way we listen to music forever. This gives such a rare inside look at the original members that it leaves you feeling like you were along for the ride. The Soundtract to this movie is a must have also! For you gen xer's, the song ""Who Are You"" wasn't always the theme song to a TV show! I highly reccomend this documentary. Long Live Rock!"
4,good,"although my item was flawed, i was given a refund and didn't have to ship it back. thanks. the product was in great condition except for the flaws"
3,Hopi-Tewa Pottery,"Granted this is a huge undertaking. And it is at present the best book on the subject. But it, like the rest of the ""American Indian Art Series,"" is not particularly well edited. And without seriously acquainting yourself with its form and arrangement - it is difficult and often frustrating to use efficiently. But it is all we have... and it is not a bad value."
1,NIGHTMARE!,"AVOID THIS COMPANY!! My unit arrived broken. Haier customer service was rude & obnoxious. They were completely unapologetic & seemed to go out of their way to be UNHELPFUL. When I finally bullied them into action, they wanted a full week to send out a service man who may or may not have been able to fix it. I spoke to both customer service and corporate, both were extremely rude and entirely useless. What's more, neither one had the decency to so much as apologize. NEVER AGAIN.This was every internet buyer's nightmare!"
1,Horrible service on a bad unit,"I bought a new Wash/dryer combo. It stopped drying, had service out they showed up wouldn't do anything because only one guy showed up, came a second time looked it over ordered a part but the thing started working, three weeks later got a survey call from the repair service company (local company for Cedar Rapids, IA) for the return service call that never happened. Called them back said that they never came, never heard from them again, nor did I ever hear from Haier. The part finally arrived after about 2 1/2 months. Dryer again stopped and is not working so I had to replace the sprayer myself. The dryer still doesn't work and now I'm told that I voided the warranty so no more repairs on it, even though the part I ended up replacing had nothing to do with what is wrong with the unit."
1,Broke after 18 months,"I've had this unit for 18 months and it just stopped drying. After reading these reviews, I'm sorry I bought this and just wanted to make sure my case was noted."
2,Combination?,"I'm not certain why they call this a combination washer/dryer. It does not dry clothes. At all. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that even when you set a separate ""dry"" cycle, there's no way to have a water level of less than 1/3 tank.I don't really trust the temperature settings---not based on data, mind you, just psychology. They're rather obscure, and it's hard to tell if you've actually changed anything.The cycle takes for f***ing EVER, even though I've given up on drying.But hey, whatever; I'm only renting this apartment. I have a shower curtain rod and a drying rack---maybe that's what they mean by ""energy efficient."""
3,good but dated,"This is a very practical book about getting your network set up. It covers windows, Macs and Linux nicely and even-handedly, but it's getting dated.It also has the annoying trait of relying on commercial software for examples. There are chapters on setting up web and email servers on all three platforms. That is Wonderful, but the author chooses commercial software (at least some of which has been significantly upgraded since the book was written). If you're not interested in that program, you're left pretty much out in the cold unless you're interested in reading about how to configure software you'll never use.It is however, very accessable and well written. An update would rate five stars for the few months it would be up to date : )"
2,Clock too small,When I received the clock yesterday I was very dissappointed. The clock was too small. From the children's bed you could hardly read the time on the clock.
5,"If you want to know Myopia, start here.","I learned more from this book about Myopia, than from 4 years in optometry School! I am ordering my second one after my first one got lost in my professional network."
1,Do not bother,"The author of this book watched Waiting decided to write a book and cast himself as Ryan Reynolds role in the movie. He must have then realised that he needed a couple more pages for his ""book"" and filled the rest in with sexest drivel that cast women as stupid customers who do not have the abillity to pay a check or giant boobs that steal his tips with their low cut tops. The only reason that anyone should waste their time or money on this book would be if they want to be editors or agents and need to know what not to publish. The authors three most used phrases are ""more about that later"", ""pun intended"", and ""that was sarcastic"". If you are reading this review and would like to read a book about being a waiter may I recomend Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress By Debra Ginsberg, or Waiter Rant: Thanks for the Tip--Confessions of a Cynical Waiter by Steve Dublanica."
4,a great book!!!,"Ransom J. Powell joins the Union army at age 13 as a drummer boy. While escorting a supply column, his regiment was captured by the Confederate army and taken to a prison in Andersonville, Georgia called Camp Sumter. While at the prison, he got the nickname Red Cap. Red Cap made the terrible times at Camp Sumter more bearable for every one there.I liked all the details in this book. The author described everything very well. I could visualize everything.I also liked reading this book because spent less time on boring things and more time on interesting things.The only bad part of this book was that there was a lot of sadness.Overall I would give this book 4 stars."
3,a good read,"Overall I liked the book, as I am a fan of civil war stories.The one part that was different from other books Ive read on this subject is that redcap was treated well by the prison guards for the most part. I dont think the enemy would have been so kind during this brutal period in our countrys history.Maybe his age was a factor.Otherwise I would recommend this book for fans of the genre only"
5,A book well worth reading,"Though I agree with the reviewers who say this book starts out slowly, it packs quite a punch. In part, for me, the punch was that I have been to Andersonville, in fact, I bought my copy at the Gift Shop there. I went to several Civil War battlefields this summer, Andersonville was different, more like a concentration camp. It's been a long time since I read every war book I could find, but I was glad I bought and read this one. Ranny's story is at once general and specific, innocent and world-weary, like him."
4,"Dickey Betts & Great Southern ""Southern Rock Jam"" = ""Great Southern Rock""!!!!!!","A great album cd by Dickey Betts & Great Southern. This cd includes 10 great songs as follows:1. Out to Get Me2. Run Gypsy Run3. Sweet Virginia4. Nothing You Can Do5. California Blues6. Good Time Feeling7. Atlanta's Burning Down8. Leavin' Me Again9. Back on the Road Again10.Dealin' with the Devil.Overall, this is a great cd, full of great southern rock, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!"
4,about meth and biblical terms,I read this book in rehab in 2003. I think that this is the same book.It seemed to be thicker then. I think that the bible verses should be of a new century version. I sent this book to my son in prison and think that it would have been easier for him to understand what the verses were saying.
5,If a former user this book will truly expose all truth about this drug to you...it will OPEN YOUR EYES!,"I read this book about eight years ago when I had just began my recovery from meth. Steve Box was in my head from the beginning! I truly believe God used Steve and this book to open my eyes in a way only God can. I believe Steve writing this book was pure revelation from the Holy Spirit to expose the Enemy (Satan) so people could be set free! John 8:36 says He who the Son sets free is free indeed! Hell is real people and being on meth especially as far as you can go with it is like living in that hell but on earth. There is an underworld out there and it is real...read this book and let the Truth be exposed to you so you too can be free!!!!!Thank you, thank you, thank you, Steve Box! You keep on writing books and spreading the Truth! It's working!"
1,Typos and Disorganization,"I hate to say that this book is poorly written, but I expected so much more. It lacks focus and appears to be simply a hodgepodge of ideas thrown together and copied from an interview. The number of typos and instances of incredibly poor grammar made this a difficult read. A former rehab patient told me that she saw meth addicts reading this one during her stay, so I bought it on faith. Sadly, I forced myself to read it and am no more knowledgeable nor enlightened than before. Oh well, we live and learn..."
4,the truth in review,"this book explains the life, trial, and afflictions of meth use, abuse and manufacter. the explanation of the above can be related to by anyone who's been in ""the game"". the outline and overview can be followed and easily interperated by anyone who hasn't but who wants to understand, without ""going behind enemy lines"". brutal honesty for those who want to see the truth and make a change. this book should be a mainstay in all prisons, treatment centers, and religious organizations nation wide. i believed i had heard or experienced all, however steve box has put all i've heard and all i know into the most rewarding format. a must have if you are into making a difference and understandig."
1,Bunch of religious hogwash,"The author of this book believes that demons posessed him and he was cured of his addiction by being held down and posessed by angel spirits. This book has absolutely ZERO scientific knowledge to share. The author was such a religious fanatic that I did not finish the book, it was utter crap."
1,don't waste your money,this juicer sucks. I was very disappointed. Returned the juicer as soon as I could.
5,fantastic new cd!!!!!!!!,I bought this cd a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVE IT. The lyrics are very compelling and the vocals are powerful.
3,Not THAT Bad,"For a discount-priced CD, this is actually not a bad buy. It does not have the same candy-coated production as MC's albums, obviously, but it is at least a decent live show. Just not exemplary.If anyone has listened to Elvis Costello's mini-box-set with Steve Nieve, COSTELLO AND NIEVE, then they know the stripped-down musical aesthetic to expect.Also, it was nice to hear a different take on the classics, particularly the guitar workout on ""Cynical Girl."""
1,Stereotypes abound,Story about a gay man who is killed by a bunch of teens because they're homophobic. The main character is a girl who is part of the group that kill him. She's horrified by their actions and learns to stand on her own two feet.Pretty terrible. The aim of the book is good (homophobia is wrong) but the execution isn't. It's poorly written and horribly paced. Key scenes appear to be missing. The whole trial about the murder isn't even described--only the outcome! The girl standing up for herself is also never described--you hear about it afterwards. Worst of all are the atrocious stereotypes. The gay men are portrayed as obnoxious and verbally vicious or spineless cowards. Oh yeah--and they run an antique store!!! The Christians are all one-dimensional Bible thumpers. It all leads up to an ending that wasn't believable for one second. The intentions are good but the book is terrible.
5,Well written,"The book was well written as is most of Bette Greene's works. I think it is good that she covered a touchy subject in today's society. However, I read the book and found it to be very depressing. I don't think I will read it again like I do most of my books."
1,one big cliche,"Under advice from an acquientence at school I attempted to read this book-and ended up hurting his feelings by laughing at it. The gay couple in this story seem to fit every single stereotype of homosexuals available. I got nearly hysterical reading the descriptions of them.The main character was a weakling with no backbone who went along with everything Andy said just so he would like her.She was annoying and unlikeable.Also annoying and unlikeable is the writing style of this book.The author was obviously trying to write a novel showing today's teenagers the danger of hatred, which was a good idea. The plot was a good idea, it was the execution that was disappointing."
4,*Probably* useful,"I found the book to be redundant for my finance class, but the content is well presented. The book serves as back-up for a finance course. The content is more detailed (longer) than in a typical college level lecture, so it's good for you don't understand a concept from the lecture. Information is long-winded but not confusing and attractively presented.Bottom Line: It's a solid finance book, but you shouldn't need it much if your professor is competent."
2,This is one of the worst economics textbooks ever,"I have to say that this is one of the worst economics textbooks that I have ever read. The font is tiny and reading it strains my eyes. The book is not written in a clear style at all. In fact, I often have to reread paragraphs just to understand what's going on. Sometimes, the authors go into needlessly long and complicated tangents to explain simple concepts. Someone needs to seriously condense and clarify the material in this textbook or else it'll become the bane of every college economics student's existence."
2,Quirky people doing quirky things does NOT make a movie.,"Question: How can you tell if someone is the geekiest, nerdiest, geeky-nerdy geek you've ever met? Answer: He thinks ""Rushmore"" is a great movie."
3,Not Harold or Maude,"""Harold and Maude"" is an excellent mostly upbeat movie, while Rushmore was the opposite. Grandly amoral, the characters charge around because of immaturity hurting each other. While there's some excellent acting in this film, I can't condone anything that happened in it. There's nothing unsexy about wearing glasses. Only thing i truely appreciated out of this movie was seeing Bill Murray acting his age."
1,AWFUL MOVIE,"I was truly disappointed with ""Rushmore"". I had heard so many good things about this movie and about Wes Anderson. WHAT A HOAX! Bill Murray did a good job, but every time I saw Jason Schwartzman, I felt like punching him in the face. His character is a compulsive liar, a bad friend, and an arrogant jerk. How am I supposed to LIKE someone so vindictive and mean? To go from bad to worse, the movie dragged unmercifully. All I can say to Wes Anderson is: you took 93 minutes of my life from me; I want them back!"
1,This movie stunk,I cannot belive that I managed to sit through the entire movie. I did not find it funny or even amusing. Murray was bland and Schwartzman was irritating. What was the plot anyway? How did Max end up with so much influence over Murray's character? What was the purpose of this film? I cannot believe it was in the comedy section- it should have been in horror for how terrifying it was in it's blandness. Don't waste your time or money on this one folks.
1,Very disappointing,I couldn't sit through more than 40 minutes of this movie. It says its a dark comedy but I didn't see any 'comedy' in it at all. Would not recommend it.
3,It keeps you interested.,"Once you get started, you just have to watch. This movie and these characters are completely engaging."
1,Please! Make it stop!,"I cannot add anything more that hasn't been already said about this terrible, terrible movie. I actually walked out on it as it played in my living room. As I sit here, the day after, my brain is still afire. I don't think I've ever felt so much contempt for a fictional character. He reminded me of another loathed nerd that has been thrust apon us: Jonathan Safran Foer! Ha! I suppose the same people that like his books would sit through this wretched mess of a movie."
5,Rushmore is good,I loved this movie. It is much better than Ferris Buellers day off. Some of the silent scenes have more impact than the spoken ones. This is mainly due to the great acting and directing. Wes Anderson is the man.
5,Brilliant and hillarious,"This was one of the most surprising movies I've ever seen. I can't describe the feeling I had after watching this in the movie theatre- very few movies have the power to do such a thing. The characters are beautifully developed, the music is amazingly apropos, and the script is hillarious. Still, i'm not sure if this is a comedy ... it's a genre of itself."
4,Quirky but satisfying,"You wont see many films like this. No matter how odd the concept everything is so beautifully real. Neatly packaged story of success (well kind of) failure and resurrection set in school. A schoolboy crush, and old man's fantasy and everyone living a dream. It is like looking at life through a distorting mirror but seeing more clearly as a result of it. The characters are great the dialogue is wonderful. It leaves you with that uneasy realisation that life is all about making the best of yourself and never denying others the opportunity of experiencing the real you."
5,best of the best,"This movie is pure inspired genius. IT definately goes into my all time favorites list. The feel of the movie is a bit too quirky for most people who are used to pre-digested hollywood sap, but for those who like something different, it is a great refreshment. oh yeah, margarette yang's really cute, too."
2,NON-ANAMORPHIC! Avoid if you have a widescreen TV,"This has nothing to do with the movie, but this particular DVD. Unlike the Criterion version, this version of Rushmore is non-anamorphic, meaning the picture quality isn't real great. Further, the movie will not fill the television screen unless you employ the zoom feature on your TV or DVD player. I loved watching this DVD on my old 19"" television, but when I switched to a nicer 42"" set, the poor quality of the video was so evident that I went out and got the Criterion edition."
1,Overrated and over done.,"I kept hearing about this movie - in fact, the Criterion Version made Entertainment Weekly's top 50 DVD list. It is not without it's critical acclaim. So I rented it... I fell asleep during my initial viewing. Thinking I was just tired, I tried to watch it the following afternoon. I almost fell asleep again. This movie is painfully boring! The characters are shallow and unlikable, and Jason Schwarzman plays Max Fischer as a sour, one-note, Holden Caulfield wanna-be. But what annoys me most about this pretentious piece of garbage is the fact that I can't get it out of my head! I keep running it over and over in my mind trying to see why anyone would find this movie worth recommending. I've had no success. My recommendation is for you to save yourself the aggravation. Buy something worth the Criterion treatment; Branagh`s Henry V for example. Rushmore is just plain terrible."
1,How boring can one movie be?,"I heard this movie was spectacular and very funny. So I rented it and boy were the critcs ever wrong on this one. The movie never really goes anywhere. Max (Schwartzman) has crush on a teacher (Williams) and when Bill Murray intervenes then Max and Murray's friendship is broken up. There are hardly any funny moments in the movie, it is boring as hell, and 5 minutes of the movie seems like 1 hour.How I sat through the entire film is still a mystery. Save your money and buy a better movie, there are tons and tons of better movies out there then Rushmore.However, if you suffer from insomnia then this is the movie to buy because it will put you to sleep faster then you can say ""BUY SOMETHING ELSE!""0 out of 5 stars. Hell, -10 out of 5 stars."
1,These reviews are more entertaining than the movie!,"How can all the four and five star people find this boring heap of film funny and entertaining? You're all way too easily amused. You definitely need to get out more. This Jason kid is about as interesting as a bowl of oatmeal. Next time, rent something a little more profound."
2,What's the big deal?,"This movie was lame, and I couldn't stand the main character. There was little comedy."
5,Flat out funny,"Rushmore is a hilarious comedy about a fifteen year old Max Fischer(Jason Schwartzman)attends a highly educated school ""Rushmore"". Herman Blume(Bill Murray)is Max's mentor. Then Rosemary Cross(Olivia Williams)comes along which attracts the both of them to compete for her. You will really really love this film. This film is also genius. This film is a smart comedy, not a stupid comedy so your going to need smarts to watch this film. Max Fischer makes the best of plays, which you would also find it to be the best. This film was written and directed from the person who did the movie ""Bottle Rocket"". This is a definite must see for everyone."
4,Pretty Good,The DVD is in great shape and I LOVED how quick it arrived! The only complaint is that it did not have the inside booklet or art. That was kind of disappointing. But other than that I am very happy with the product.
4,Cute dark comedy,"I love Bill Murray but Jason Schwartzman stole the show. He was perfect for this part, he is a very versatile actor. The story is quirky and fun and I am a bit surprised at the 'R' rating as it does not reflect as an 'R' movie. I recommend."
5,Thanks Owen and Wes,"Thank you,Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson,for scripting a creative masterpiece like Rushmore. I loved this film. All of it. The actors were all perfectly cast, the soundtrack is on my Christmas list and the dialogue had my house echoing laughter! Please don't stop making films!"
1,What a boring movie.,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I remember seeing 2-3 funny moments in the trailer. I had no idea that those 2-3 moments were the ONLY funny moments in this f***** movie. The five stars are by critics - no need to say anything else - or people who lost money on this film and want you to lose money also."
1,Please....,"This film starts out very dull and boring and goes downhill from there. I love comedies and after reading the reviews I expected something as good as all the films it was compared to. No dice. It is badly written, terribly cast, poorly acted, and horribly edited... it should have been chopped down to 3 minutes. It has nothing going for it, so if a zero were allowed, that would be my rating. It is now on my list of the 10 worst films I have ever seen. Avoid at all costs unless you like cruel and unusual punishment. This film should be used to torture prisoners of war... after fifteen minutes of this crap, they would confess anything not to watch any more of it. If you like watching grass grow, this is the film for you... but then, on second thought, it is more boring than that. Grass has beauty."
2,What a waste of Bill Murray,"I can't believe the number of people who think this movie was good. I think they read the press too much who said it was a ""smart"" comedy. Well, if smart means dull, then yeah, it was a smart comedy. Someone actually compared this to Ferris Bueller. Not a chance. Buy Ferris and actually laugh."
2,Not worth my time.,"I am a really big Bill Murray fan, so when my husband was given this movie for a birthday present, I naturally wanted to see it. I'm sorry I did.Jason Schwartzman played a fifteen year old egotistical snot who was failing his academic courses at the prestigious Rushmore High School. He was involved in all kinds of extra-curricular activities, but he just couldn't make the grade as far as science, history, etc. Instead of being a nice person, he has to be an obnoxious son of a gun just because he doesn't get his way.When confronted by an equally obnoxious Scotsman, Jason quickly states that he did ugly things to his little best friend's mother.Then Bill Murray, a married man, cheats on his wife with the best friend's mother, and that made me not like HIM very much.The entire movie Rushmore should be canned and started over again, this time with a little more good attitude than bad.I would encourage people not to waste their hard earned money on a movie of this calibre."
1,"I missed something, obviously.","Aftre reading good reviews of this movie, I went out and rented it. I didn't get it. I watched it again. I still didn't get it. I watched it a third time, and fell asleep halfway through. I then gave up. This is just another contrived high school angst movie masquerading as a hilarious indie spoof. They're not fooling me; this movie is a total waste of time and money. It's not original, it's not snappy, it's not a ""breath of fresh air,"" and most of all, it's not funny."
2,Don't RUSH see this flick,"Had vaguely heard this was popular cult-type flick about a 15 year-old coming of age. Movie starts out with some clever Schtick and some mild laughter over protagonist, Max Fleishman's chutzpah. But how many times do his antics save the day, NOT MANY. As additional characters Bill Murray, and easy on the eyes school marm, enter the scene, the plot thickens into a love triangle, then thins back into celibacy. Max's glibness and my belief that there must be some BIG moment to justify all the critical acclaim did keep this writer watching until the end. None of the others in my viewing made it that far before nodding off.Some high points include those involving Max's barber, come neursurgeon father. We do learn another whole side of Max when his downfall results in his following in his father's hair cutting footsteps.I had hoped this would be another Napoleon Dynamite type independent film, but alas I learned too late that its was just another loser like the Royal Tannenbaums."
2,Is it me?,"I felt guilty for the longest time because I didn't like this movie while everyone else I knew did. But today I'm liberated. I'm telling the world, ""This movie is boring and pretentious and nepotistic [find out who the lead actor is and how much previous experience he had], and I don't care who knows it!"""
1,a 'high brow' dog is still a dog....thank you.,"This is really a pretty bad film. One gets the impression critics were over-identifying with the geeky main character, or at least that the film's direction was different enough to merit accolades based solely on this.Save your money. It's a different kind of film and the acting is good-particularly Murray's and female protagonist. But it's skillet deep. Weird kid has crush on teacher, competes with friend, has irrelevant or at least undeveloped romantic subplot with an Asian student. The is as ponderous and heavy as a three-legged elephant. It doesn't matter to me if a main character is antisocial as this would exclude many great works of art (Crime & Punishment, the stranger, Goodfellas), but the character's struggles are overwrought. It's like if Beverly Hills 90210 decided to have a 'Pained Intellectual' Episode. It would produce jason schwartzmann at the Peach Pit.that's it."
2,Over-rated and over-long...,"Is this really a 93 mintue movie, as the description above states? It seemed about twice that long. Desperately in need of a qualified editor; it seemed to end at least 3 times before it actually ended. Remind why I'm supposed to care about any of these immature, obnoxious people...? I guess that explains its following (""takes one to know one"", etc.)..."
2,This was Filmed at My High School!,"This movie was filmed at my high school. We all clamored to see it and enjoyed watching it because there were several of our friends in some scenes. However, when I watched a second and then a third time, it lost all glitter and glamour for us, and we began to see it as just another bad movie. I recommend seeing it maybe one time, just to see it, but definitely not twice."
5,"You, You're Out!","I had never heard of Anderson movies until I saw the preview for RUSHMORE, and I HAD to see it and Bottle Rocket. This movie was so unique, intelligent, and funny that I fell in love with it instantly. It was a sort of Neo-New Wave piece of cinema that I hadn't seen in movies for a while. The soundtrack flowed with the lyrical storytelling and complimented it instead of being a catchy platform to sell artists. I bought the first DVD three days before I learned the Criterion Collection DVD version was being released and I was furious that I will have to buy both versions now since I would have bought the Criterion if I had known. I have shown this movie to all my friends and it has become a cult following and growing. Well that's it, tag'em and bag'em, Jerries,we're moving out. P.S. I can't wait for Anderson's next piece of genius!"
2,Not Very Good,Not nearly as goo as I thought it would be. The soundtrack is excellent though.(The music album)
2,requires a certain type of humor to appreciate it,"The owner of the video store warned us about this movie - it only appeals to a certain segment of the population, he told us. He was right. Among the audience I watched it with, half loved it and half hated it. I didn't appreciate the movie's humor because I thought it failed to develop a minimal level of empathy for the characters. As a result, I couldn't convince myself to care much as they moved from debacle to debacle. Not very entertaining in my opinion, but it seems to appeal to some, especially those that sympathize with oddball characters."
5,A test of taste,If you don't love this movie either you are too young or too stupid to recognize the talent of Wes Anderson.
1,Boring boring boring,"I bought this dvd and I still feel sorry for that.No humour at all. Can't understand that people like this film.Didn't laugh once. A comedy? Not for me. Was happy when the film was over, yes I watched the entire film, hoping it would improve. But it didn't. Waste of time."
1,Love's Labour Really Lost,"I love edgy comedy. I love independent movies. I love arthouse cinema, foreign film, Elvis Mitchell, the collected works of Pauline Kael and Bill Murray's serio-comic performances. And oh how I hate this movie. An amusing 45 minute sketch drawn out beyond endurance. Tried it in the theater. Tried it on DVD. Alas, alack, a loser."
1,"The unfunniest ""funny"" movie of the year !","I found this movie to be one of the unfunniest ""funny"" movies I've ever seen. There is no continuity in the plot, the characters are shallow and the sexual references are only there to get ratings. Murray is pitiful and the other actors aren't much better. If you want to waste your money, see Rushmore."
5,Great Movie,"Wes Anderson makes beautifully funny movies, with great characters and cinematography, and perfect soundtracks. Herman Blume's cannonball, especially the aerial view of his tanned, corpulent body over the dully blue pool, is hilarious. I recommend this movie unreservedly."
5,Most original movie seen in a very long time,I thought this was the most original movie I had seen in a very long time. Being a huge Bill Murray fan didn't hurt either. Mr. Murray's expressions are priceless. You will like this movie more each time you see it.
3,"Great movie, DVD priced far too high","There isn't much I can't say about this film that hasn't already been said. This is a great comedy, and probably my favorite of Wes Anderson's films. It's awesome how much input he puts into the DVDs of his films thanks to Criterion. However, 35.99?!?!? You can get the Lord of the Rings: Extended Editions at Best Buy for 10 bucks cheaper, and they have far far more extras and hard work put into them. Do I recommend this DVD? Yes, but I'd recommend finding one used so you aren't dropping so much money. Try finding it for around 20 and you will be very satisfied."
5,Im an alternate,"I know its been said, but theres a reason for that: this is the greatest comedy I have ever seen, absolutely. Owen Wilson is a genius, and Bill Murray is beyond hillarious. A gifted Jason Schwartzman and an astounding supporting cast make this an absolute must have. I dont yet have the Criterion DVD edition, but by looking at the list of features, and judging by the Chasing Amy criterion edition, the purchase will be more than worth it."
2,"Disappointing,unique but went nowhere.","Max captures us right from the start as an outrageous paradox. Nerd who gets bad grades, ability to talk his way to anything but gets nothing really done. Movie then doesn't do much with him and Bill Murray. A couple of good scenes then drag into a mean spirited, baffling last 45 minutes. I was expecting much more from the hype. Obscure Who and Stones songs are very cool though. Definitely a rent, not a buy."
5,THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN CITIZEN KANE!,"This is a great American film. The performances are amazing, Bill Murrys best film since Razors Edge. The writing is incredible, best writing since Wes Anderson's last film Bottle Rockett. The soundtrack is incredible, best soundtrack ever. If you have half a brain you will vote Rushmore for President next year. This film compeled me to buy a kite. It's just that good!"
3,"Long, but quirky & funny","This is really a funny and at times touching film. It's a bit overlong, but Bill Murray and the other actors are great. I really liked this movie. Definately not for those that don't like to think."
1,???????,"I think I've figured out that everyone connected with the making of this over-long skit (the bad ones are always over long)wrote the rave reviews. What a pointless piece of drivel. No plot, no laughs, no thought provoking, nothing, that about sums up this total waste of time."
1,Boooooooring,"One of the worst movies ever made in all of movie history. No acting, the WORST screenplay, an absolute bore!!!! A total waste of time. NOT FUNNY."
1,Can you rate a movie zero stars?,"... I did not laugh a single time at this movie. It seemed tome to be written and directed by a fifteen-year-old who had justdiscovered that being quirky is cool. My idea of subtle, quirky humor is ""Cold Comfort Farm"" or ""Chasing Amy."" ""Rushmore"" is a movie about high school that seems like it was written by a high-schooler. By the way, if you want to see a great movie about high school, see ""Election."" END"
1,"terrible, terrible film",what a pitifully bad flick. jason schwartzman's career started and ended here. pass on this bomb.
1,One of the all-time worst movies!!,A root canal would have been less painfull. I immediately went back to my video store and requested a refund. 1 star is way too generous.
1,What was all the hype about?,Really disappointing. Bill Murray is wasted here. I only laughed because I thought I was supposed to laugh. I did like Max's quirkyness but it was not enough to carry the whole movie. I feel cheated out of $30.00. My best advice is to rent before you buy.
5,in your face,"Although many have chosen ""quirky"" as a way to describe this film, it is only at a loss for an accurate one-word description. This is an original film on a variety of levels (from the most base to the most intellectual). I would especially recommend seeing Bottle Rocket prior to this film. Not only will it allow one to be initiated to this unique brand of humor, but it allows one to compare characters between the two films (the dynamic of kubar and littlejeans is incredible)."
4,"Off beat, quirky, and an unusual movie. See it!","This is an entertaining and intelligent movie. Unexpected and different than the typical ""Hollywood"" movie. Refreshing and fun. Give it a chance and stick with it...it is worth it!"
5,"Colorful, vibrant, poignant, and sounds great!","The weird thing about 'Rushmore' is the fact that it leaves you in stitches and you can't figure out why! Bill Murray gives a gut-wrenchingly subtle performance as eccentric millionaire Herman Blume. Set to a wonderful soundtrack and floating musical score by DEVO member Mark Mothersbaugh, 'Rushmore' delivers in every way possible."
3,Liked to be confused? This could be the movie for you!,"I read the other reviews where they said you would either love it or hate it. I am a person who likes to make up my own mind. I love Bill Murray. He is a genius, as far as acting is concerned. This movie however did not star Bill Murray. He was given a small, insignificant role. So, don't rent this movie just because he is in it.I have to admit that throughout the movie I was throughly confused. I did not know what was going to happen next. I swear, there were times in the movie that I thought the credits were going to roll and the movie would be over.I did laugh, but I can count the number of times on one hand. This is not a bad movie, it's just not the movie that I've come to expect from Bill Murray.If you're tired of watching predictable movies, watch Rushmore, but don't watch it if you think it is going to be another great comedy by Bill Murray. Instead watch my favs Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters and The Man Who Knew Too Little."
5,Original under-rated gem,"Thoroughly enjoyable quirky film with standout performances by the leads. I'll watch anything Bill Murray is in - this film is not a laugh riot - is is an intelligent, original perceptive movie. I've watched this about 5 times. Worth buying."
2,Too few funny moments,"Based upon all the accolades heaped upon it by numerous critics, I was led to believe that the movie would be different, challenging, and extremly funny. While it met the first of these, there was little challenge in the typical Hollywood ""everyone falls in love ending"", and the abandoment of what makes Max so fascinating...that he is so different. At the end, I was halfway expecting there to be multiple wedding scenes, when, Max sabotaging his own play with dynamite and bees would befit his character. As far as the humor goes, the funny moments and sight gags were too far inbetween. Max at dinner and Bill Murray at his son's birthday party were comedic highlights, and likely to be some of the funniest, wry humor moments you'll ever see in a film, but the rest of the movie was bogged down by almost mechanical feelings of love and romance. For a movie championing the outcast, it sure made conformity look good."
1,"Dull ... Dull ... Boring , Bill Murray at his worst","We could not wait for the movie to end. In fact, we didn't, although my S.O. hung in to the end hoping it would improve. She said it didn't. Bill Murray was abused by his embarrassing role as a rich man with mouth hanging open, dumb, lost look in eyes, catering to an unrelated 15 year old's whim's & wishes. The notion of a 15 year old who acted and looked more like 22, who was the class nerd but also the bad sheep and at the same time the head of every extra-curricular school activity was not only far-fetched, but appeared to be written by a real 15 year old class nerd with poor writing skills on an extreme day dream away from reality. Poorly written, unbelievable characters, and drawn out and slow, and only one semi-funny line in the whole affair."
1,Don't believe the hype!!,I'd rented this movie because I heard a lot of good buzz about it. Why do the critics and some of the reviewers on this page like this movie is beyond my understanding. I hated that Max character and the movie took too long to tell me what would become of him. The only thing that I liked about this movie was Murray's Mr. Blume and his two evil twin sons.
1,"Bad, really really bad","I saw this movie in reaction to such wonderful critical praise. I was deceived. This movie was not brilliant or wonderful, nor was the story any good (and the acting for that matter) I found the plot completly unrealistic and the characters unappealing. I could not figure out the plot, and moreover, I could not figure out why so many people liked it. Also, can anyone tell me if it was a comedy or a drama? It wasn't funny or very dramatic, so I couldn't really qualify it in any catagory. If you want a movie about a disfuntional teen, I would like you to see a good movie like maybe A Clockwork Orange say. Another good Malcolm McDowell vehicle that is more along Rushmore lines is IF. Personally I think it is a better film than Rushmore, and is what Rushmore could have been."
2,Good for a rainy day,"Max Fischer( Jason Schwartzman) is the most industious 10th grader of all time. He has founded seemingly every club at Rushmore, a prestigious private school, where he has a full scholarship. The only problem: Max is a horrible student and is failing most of his classes. Add to the mix a pretty kindergarten teacher (Olivia Williams) that Max and one of his teachers (Bill Murray) fall in love with, and you have all the twists and turns of a high school soap opera.I was not impressed with the ending, but at least it was realistic. Most teenagers would enjoy the goofy humor, but parents may be wary. Not a bad movie for a rainy day.Mr.F"
4,The Best Film of 1998?,"If there was one movie that was overlooked and underappreciated in 1998 it was, without a doubt, 'Rushmore'. Everything you've heard about Bill Murray is true. He should have walked away with the little gold man. Actually, everybody in the film does a great job. And let's not leave out director Wes Anderson. He's given us another glint of hope that plot still triumphs over spectacle and the box office-minded."
5,Top Ten Best Ever,"This is an exquisite and wonderfully poignant film, mercifully void of sentiment. It's an extraordinary achievement and one of a handful of films that I've been compelled to watch 3, 4, or 5 times. Personally, I hope Jason Schwartzman never does another film, so that he'll always stay Max Fischer. Besides, nothing else will compare."
4,excellent,"You like Wes Anderson films or not, maybe you're white and you do? If so, you will like this one too."
4,Romantic Comendy,This movie taken an interesting approach the the stale era of romantic comedies and it does a good job of doing so. It's funny and entertaining worth a watch.
5,Harold & Maude & Bill Murray,"I couldn't quite put my finger on why I love this movie so much. Not when I first saw it, and not after several repeat viewings. The doomed platonic romance of Olivia Williams and Jason Schwatzman is reminiscent of Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon in Harold & Maude, but it gets more complicated and funnier when Bill Murray takes notice of his young protege's object of affection. The dialogue is perfect from the ""O R they"" line to Williams' impassioned speeches. Jason's extra-curricular activities, every image on the screen is perfectly in character and amusing to say the least. It's not hard to understand why this film was not compared to SPR and SIL. But it's also hard to understand why it wasn't."
5,Great read,Great read for anyone who wants to get a flavor of the Alaska life and great figurative return for those who have lived it. It is also great literature because he was an English professor.
1,A Great Korngold Sampler; An Audio Disaster!,"This is a CD set whose objective was truly outstanding!Regrettably, it's audio execution is HORRIBLE. I can't bare tolisten to it--and I truly love to hear Korngold conducting hisown film symphonies (especially when they are on CDs directlylinked with ""his"" film studio). Hopefully, there will be asecond version using modern digital techniques to render theseinvaluable historical recordings palatable to ear."
5,Shrunken Faries,"This book is a beautiful shrunken version of the ""Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book"". It is an exact replica only about 1/8th the size of the original, which is something to be aware of if purchasing for yourself. This book makes a great gift book for almost anybody, the story is comical and the art work breathtaking."
3,I would've given this dvd five stars but:,"1.Voyager Entertainment did not digitally re-master this in 5.1 dolby digital sound.2. There is no second dialogue track for English.3. And worst of all, just like all the voyager releases of the yamato films it is not presented in it's original theatrical widescreen aspect ratio. With all that said, It's still one of the great modern space operas. If only Voyager Entertainment will sometime remaster these films in widescreen, and offer the series (starblazers) and these films in superior 5.1 sound and digital cleaned up versions. And maybe someday they will offer westerners the option to buy the original uncut japanese star blazers films, and t.v. shows. Not the kiddieized censored versions people get here in the u.s. ."
5,"Believe the hype, pushing the envelope on reggae","Glad to see others got the message on this one too. I've been a huge fan of this album since it came out. It's heavy and dark. Lee comes up with some great hooks and lines and the sinister dub-and-fire-and-thunder effects are awesome. Excellent album, 5 stars all the way."
4,A pleasure to work with,"Well balanced, light weight, comfortable grips. I gave this set a four-star rating only because the tip of the smallest slotted screwdriver broke while working on a camera. The tip is (necessarily) very thin, so one must expect limitations. The driver in question was not being misused at the time... Perhaps , given the high degree of temper used in the manufacture, the metal may have crystallized. The really great news is that ""Felo"" tools carry an unconditional lifetime warranty and Amazon was ""Johnny-on-the-spot"" by sending me a new set the very next day!!!Good Tool and Great Service... What more could a person hope for!"
2,Mixed Results,"Felo should be embarrassed by putting their fine tools in such a useless plastic box -- it's junk, it falls apart. It's the wrong choice, the wrong marketing path. What were they thinking? I am a tool aficionado; I enjoy using fine tools. I am willing to pay for excellence. My solution was to store the Felo screwdrivers in a Wiha canvas wrap alongside outstanding Wiha screwdrivers. Furthermore, why did I receive Felo screwdriver kit 04224096156 (with a UPC code of 007157318442) when my order called for Felo screwdriver kit 0715731848? So many numbers, so little time."
4,Good! Works!,"This item works to cut down on engine noise made by aftermarket stereos/amps...really cut down on the noise, but not completely...but still a big difference."
3,Does What It's Suppose To.. Been using for 2wks 12-5-2010,"Got a diff car, installed all amps/speakers/receiver & after it, whining noise!I already have one Tsunami brand noise filter, which I bridged to fit two RCA cables, but it didnt cure it completely.So Amazon to the rescue, these are the CHEAPEST $ noise filters you'll find.. Once I got 'em I immediately noticed theyfelt cheap, light, & thought perhaps wouldn't work (or not as well as the Tsunami, which is heavier). I hooked them up& whining noise almost disappeared completely. So, even though they DON'T FEEL as reliable as the Tsunami one, they do work.I still like the Tsunami better, which I connected to my bass amp (just cus) but now I broke the RCAs.. for now I'll keep thesePyramids.. Hope this Helps. Yes, cheap, yes they work, yes you can get it shipped Free if you play the Super Saver game correctly :)"
4,not bad,inline is the good thing here just plug it in most of the u have to run a grd wire not this one and works fine 4 stars
1,JUNK,This is a piece of junk. Two parts of it were bad. It doesn't pay to send it back because the postage is almost the price of the product. I just trashed it and bought a decent one from Radio Shack.
1,Siamese cats,A basic book which doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know unless you've never had a cat before
4,Good introduction to Siamese cats...,"...but not a lot of depth. This was the only book on Siamese cats I could find at my local Borders, and it seems like it's one of very few titles in print on the breed at all. It's a good intro. but focuses a lot on basics of cat care that don't really have anything to do with the breed. I'd like to see more meezer details!"
5,An absolute MUST for the first time Siamese human,"...The author is a lifelong owner of Siamese cats and her personal anectdotes really put my mind at ease. It gives a priceless and sensitive insight to the intelligence and mannerisms of a Siamese cat that also explains the reasons and breeding history behind their perceived ""quirks"" that makes it all make sense, and opens you up to the joy of being owned by a Siamese..."
3,Good starter book,"This book is a good introduction to Siamese cats. My version is somewhat dated as it still recommends FIP and FeLV vaccinations. It also doesn't describe the risks of rabies vaccines. I've yet to find a really good reference book for comprehensive feline health information. Cats often exhibit much more subtle symptoms than dogs. I also would like to find better information on issues relative to purebreds. The Cornell Book of Cats is a good next book, but I'm still searching for an advanced layperson's book."
4,Good General Cat Manuel,"The material presented is well-presented for the average lay reader. It's a general over-view of Siamese cats, with a fairly extensive section on breeding.I would have preferred for Collier's book to have dealt more with behavior and training. The two subjects receive some attention, just not enough."
1,I thought Sony was quality,"This is my second sony dvd player. The first lasted about a year and was hardly used. Out of no where the Drive on it stopped functioning. So now I go out and buy another sony dvd player, the DVP-NS425P, to replace it. No longer than a month later the drive dies the exact same way. What I can conclude from this is either Sony is using recycled drives or they are using faulty drives in their dvd players. From now on I'm not paying $100+ for dvd players. Sony has caused me to lose faith in their products and I will no longer pay for their name. Maybe you will or do have better luck with Sony but I will stick to something cheaper. Then maybe I will feel like I've gotten my moneys worth."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS NUT!,"I ordered this dvd player then cancelled within in hour once i saw i was being charged $63.98! It was supposed to be $16.99 plus $19.50 shipping.I then received a remote control for the dvd player and it was in nasty condition! Gross! I havent checked my credit card yet, i think i was charged for the remote."
5,Excellent product,"You will hear nothing but raves for this product from our house. It has an excellent picture, great sound ... it's easy to use and is certainly a superior piece of technology. (The zoom feature is a real plus.) Would recommend the Audiovox D2016 10"" Hi-Fi Slim Line Portable DVD Player to anyone ... and it's at a great price too."
4,audiovox d2016 10-inch hi-fi slim line portable dvd prayer.,"this dvd prayer is good ,it does everything ,perfert picture ,sperkers ere good but battery life is very poor when u inpug it goes dead."
1,OOPS! got a lemon!,"Got this item for my husband to watch DVDs as we were flying across country for Thanksgiving.Worked a total of 45min. Screen would not light up properly to see movie. Just had a chance to return it. Hopefully I will get a new one or a credit. One good thing, I ordered it late and they got it to right on tome!D"
1,Item stops working,"I was pleased with this product until stopped working 3 weeks after I bought it. Of course, the seller only guarantees it for 10 days and only if you keep the original packaging. The seller offered to take the product back and replace it for me only if I promised to take down my negative review and only if I had the original packaging. They claimed they could not send it to audiovox without the original packaging but meanwhile audiovox assured me that I could send it to them with no problem in another box. That is ridiculous and I advise everyone to not buy this product or anything from this vendor. I had to pay more money to send it back to audiovox and who knows if they will fix it or what. This has been a huge hassle and I am never buying from an amazon vendor again."
3,Battery life shorter than Audiovox claimed,"The image and sound are good, but the life of the new battery is only 1.5 hours instead of Audiovox claimed ""at least 2.5 hours"", hardly to cover a normal movie."
2,Content Doesn't Live Up to the Title,"This book, written in a straightforward style, is a broad overview or general introduction for someone who doesn't know anything about mediumship. But, it doesn't, as the author admits, give you a concrete, step-by-step technique for contacting your loved ones, as the title seems to promise. Indeed, she states it takes years of practice and sitting in a circle of more developed, like-minded people to get anywhere in mediumship--time which people who have to work for a living do not have. Her snippets of information about various aspects of the subject are like being served a dinner of hors d'oeuvres and being deprived of the main course, not to mention dessert."
2,Only helpful if,"you want to become a professional Medium.If you just want to learn to contact the dead for yourself, this is not the book for you."
3,meh,"I thought it would hold more than one ball.... I guess they mean it when they say Personal... My bad.. That being said, the bag is a bit flimsy."
2,Not at all helpful,"My niece wants to learn German so I thought I would buy her this book. I speak fluent German and I thought it would be helpful, and a cute way to learn. This is a cute book with cute pictures. It is not helpful for learning German, however. There does not seem to be a pronunciation guide.Each page has about 15 words alphabetically with the word in English, the word in German, a sentence in German, the picture, and the sentence in English. If you didn't know German already, you could not learn it from this book because you wouldn't be able to read the sentence (or the word, for that matter), nor would your pronunciation be good. BTW it is alphabetized in English. It has a couple of pages with the numbers (1,2,3...) written out in German, the days of the week, etc. But it's just not helpful. Plus, I think that for anyone old enough to read English OR German by themselves, the pictures are too babyish."
4,Definitely helpful for me.....,"Although I agree with the other reviewer that this book may not be very useful for someone who knows no German, my experience was different. I am 42 years old and decided to teach myself German several months ago. I checked out books/cds from the library, visited many websites, etc. to learn everything I could. I came across this book while I was working in a middle school library and liked it so much that I bought one myself. Because I had learned many nouns and lots of basic verbs (and pronunciation), this little book filled in some gaps along the way for me. It helped me understand a little more about sentence structure (although the sentences are all present tense) and how certain words are used (often not at all the way we would use them in English). There are LOADS of very common words and I've learned a lot. Could you hand it to a child and expect her to learn German from it? NO WAY. Can it be used to help someone who is already learning German? DEFINITELY."
5,Tiki/Lounge music. Great background music.,This is great! Music from an old time Tiki Bar. The Rat Pack era. . .background music that requires a Cocktail or some kind of Tropical Drink. I tested it. It works.
3,Good but handle poorly,"I received my Pirouline wafers after ordering a case of 6 cans, however, up to now, I have opened three cans and all the contents are broken or shredded due to poor handling.I was hoping to use this to decorate cakes or served with a foamy cappuccino, but it is not possible now, since they are all broken and pulverized on the bottom.Please don't get me wrong. The product is delicious but worthless to my purpose."
1,Arrived broken into little pieces,"Although these are great, as far as taste and lightness are concerned, I will never order them through Amazon again. I placed an order for several cans because they are not available in the area where I recently moved. Upon opening the first can I was thoroughly disappointed to find the contents to be broken into little pieces. Not one of the cans had any piece more than 1 1/2 inch long. Most of the pieces were under 1 inch. Unless you intend to use them as a crumb topping for ice cream or something similar, don't order them thru Amazon."
3,"Great product, but buy locally rather than online","The quality of these pirouline cookies is unsurpassed, but I was very disappointed with this purchase. It was shipped quickly, but arrived mostly crushed. Most of the cookies were broken and many were crushed at the bottom. We purchased them for a formal dinner and gifts. Unfortunately, because of their condition, we will have to purchase other wafers locally and eat these ourselves. I would not recommend purchasing this product through delivery."
4,Good Product if the product is Fresh,Before you buy ask the expiration date.These are usually very good wafers but the expire datemust not be past or within a few weeks.Only buy if fresh.
3,Not as fresh as I had hoped,"I was surprised when I opened the first box of these Piroulines. They were not that CRISP CRUNCHY cookie I had anticipated. They are all wrapped up very well and sealed shut but still act as though they are stale. Sorry.The ones I bought at the grocery store were PERFECT!! so, I don't know what happened. I'll try again when they have more."
5,Delicious!,"These wafers are incredibly delicious! Amazon sells them by the case, and I order them to have for gifts. Everyone who has tasted them raves about them--even if they say they don't like dark chocolate."
2,Great Taste. Poor condition,"Review of Pirouline Wafers. I've received two orders. I love the texture and taste.My last order was for a party. In each can at least half the wafers were in small pieces.Inedible, let alone a treat for a party.With regret I cancel my subscription."
5,Veggie Tales loved by 6 month old girl.,"Our grand daughter is 6 months old and has fallen in love with this DVD. She had been loving a Baby Genius dvd and her mother had heard it so many times, so I decided to try her on Veggie Tales. The story ones didn't hold her interest as much, but when this one went in she started laughing and bouncing up and down. Our daughter says that Aubree Ann will set and watch it and laugh for the longest time. Glad to see her loving something Spiritual at that age."
2,"Great Range, Poor Sound Quality",The title says it all. I ended up getting another headset for my SLVR because people had a hard time hearing me. The range and battery life on this is positive though..
1,Avoid this product,"After one week, the fragile earhook fell off and Samsung offers no replacement. Samsung's advice was to buy a new headset!"
2,"Stylish, but there is a catch","I got it at pretty good price, and it paired with my Samsung T809 good, and works quite good. Voice quality is goot after changing the channel with much statics... Yet there is a catch. The other side of the line hears echo (of their won voice). I testes extentively what could be the cause, but failed. I even blocked the microphone of the bluetooth since the earphone itself is not a snug fit to the ear, and may be the sound from the earphone may be leaking to the microphone, but nothing worked. The other side still hears the echo. It's a real pity... 'cause it looks so good, and matches prefectly with my phone, but can't be selfish to keep using it when whoever I talk to complains every time about the echo."
2,Fair at best,"I thought I'd try the WEP150 since the Motorola 850 I had was choppy when the phone was more than 10 inches from the headset. This one does the same thing though. I wear my Samsung A920 phone on my left hip and the headset on my right ear. I'm not fat, but the short distance it must go, though my body, between the phone and the headset just seem to be too much, and I get choppy reception on my end. People I'm talking to have not complained. The headset is OK when within line of set, from my hip to the headset, but it gets choppy if I move my arm in the way. I'm thinking it may not have enough power, but I really expected it to have sufficient power.Perhaps it is the phone's fault, since both the Mot and the 150 do the same thing, but I have no way to test that at this time.I bought the headset locally, at Best Buy, just so I would be able to return it if I didn't like the performance. Glad I did, even though it cost more."
5,Concise and Authoritative,"The latest hardware book by Robert and Barbara Thompson continues their trend of well written, dependable advice. The book covers all major categories or components required for building your own PC. While the book is a good source of ""consumer reports"" style of product recomendations, I find the explanations of what to look for and why it's important especially useful. In every instance, Thompson's recomendations reinforce that quality and reliability are the hallmarks to look for not only in individual components, but the manufacturers and vendors you purchase them from.The book is also an example of the high quality/rapid deployment technology used by the publisher. I'm reading the book in February 2005 and the text continues to note the state of affairs as of January 2005! Again, always look for quality and reliability, even from publishers and authors like O'Reilly and the Thompsons."
5,I Wish I Had This Book Before I Built My First PC,"This book gives the kind of component selection advice I wish I had before I built my first PC. Just the advice on case selection alone would have saved me from those annoying cut fingers which always happen with cheap cases.If you are going to build a PC, the advice on the foldout back cover is worth the purchase price. The other 127 pages which explain the recommendations and the rationale behind them are a great bonus.If you are going to build your own PC, I urge you to read this book. I think the book is worth it, and I have a BSEE and have built a handful of PCs in the past few years."
5,take it with you,"This is just the book to take with you to the computer show or computer store. It is small enough, and packed with the reference material you will need, especially if your memory for specific components is beginning to fade like mine."
5,A great help for assembling a PC,"The Thompson's ""PC Hardware Buyer's Guide"" is the perfect companion to their previous book, ""Building the Perfect PC"". In this book, you will find a wealth of information as to what components you should consider purchasing to build your PC, in more detail than they were able to fit into ""Building the Perfect PC.""If you want to know what all the different processors are, for example, what the difference is between Pentium 4's listed as a 2.8A, 2.8B, or 2.8C, you can find that information in this book. If you just want to know what processor to purchase, that's here too, with clear guidelines to help you decide.Bob and Barbara take you through the whole spectrum of components that make up a PC, from the case, motherboard, and CPU, through memory, storage, and displays, all the way down to keyboard and mice, with clear discussions and thoughtfully reasoned suggestions for what to use for a budget, mainstream, or premium machine.I highly recommend this book."
5,Too much to remember - bring the book along,"I bought Building the Perfect PC a while back, and greatly enjoyed it. But he component section really seemed to focus on the configurations built in the book. Fine, but left me wanting. This book ought to be called ""the missing chapter"" or something. It covers all the important component choices you have to make when building your own PC with real-world, experience-based advice the Thompsons have gathered. How much to spend for a processor? And which processor to buy? This book will tell you what the trade-offs are and where the sweet-spot is. For lots more than just processors, of course, they cover all the major components. They name names and call it like they see it in a straight-forward writing style I found easy to keep up and stay engaged with. And the back cover folds out to be a two page buyer's guide you can take down to your favorite computer store, or keep open as you look at the Internet site. Great, condensed, advice. Recommended."
2,PC Hardware Buyer's Guide: Choosing the Perfect Components,"Upon initial publication, was likely an excellent supplement to the authors' publication ""Building the Perfect PC"". Information is now out of date regarding many computer components. Sorry that I wasted my money on this."
3,Personal account of life in the ATC world...,"Actually 3 1/2 stars...I was a little disappointed in this because I was expecting more technical explanation of ATC practices versus a kind of memoir on Brenlove's life in ATC. There were some definite interesting parts and this book isn't bad at all, just know what you'll be reading when you get it. That being said, I'd probably still buy this book because, as I mentioned before, there is some value here and makes for entertaining reading, just don't expect to gain any real insight into ATC processes."
3,"Fine art, Dorks and Heavies","A semi-religious ""artistic"" murder by an high IQ mad manthat is also connected to the death of a drug lordand stolen art makes for a dangerous detective story in a Boston blizzard.As an art historian the guy is really lucky...as a real detective he would be dead in a ditch.My take on this story is that it was an interesting readand I might even pick up another book bythis author if given a chance."
5,PERFECT***** Exactly what I was looking for!,"This CD is OUTSTANDING! I got it today when I was looking for ""soft, peaceful background music"" to bring through my books. I put it on, and must have played it at least seven times - and I'm not even writing today!This CD would be perfect for anyone who is getting a very relaxing massage, for people who meditate, or would just love peaceful music. I feel the energy of it and it is soooo pure!Marina Raye uses the Native Flute, and the melodic sounds (NOT chants) are BLISSFULLY peaceful.This is now my favorite peaceful, background music - I've listed to many before that were all wonderful. I just think this particular CD is extraordinary!What a gift!!!"
3,Turns out Saddamn DID have WMDs,"In the 16-Bit era the ""Strike"" series never really amounted to much. My favourite of that time wasUrban Strike, but the series greatly improved on the PlayStation with better graphics, sound and smoother gameplay.The story here has the son of Saddam (Uday or Qusay) conspiring with a drug dealer to destroy the USA...yadda, yadda, yadda. It's tripe, but the main attraction here is blowing stuff up in a big helicopter, or hovercraft. Time, unfortunately, has not been kind to the 16-Bit era ""Strike"" games. Characters are pathetic little stick figures, explosions are clunky and the handling of the chopper is sluggish.If you want to experience the best of what the series has to offer then check outNuclear StrikeorSoviet Strike."
3,All I can say is wow,This is a follow up to the original 1954 Godzilla film. Godzilla isn't the same monster as in the original film but in the line of the same species. A relative maybe? It's cool to see Angurius debut in this movie. He and Godzilla kick each others asses all over Japan. Godzilla eventually defeats him. I heard they used the wrong speed on the cameras when they were filming it. As you will see the monsters look like they have ADHD and are hyper as hell. With todays technology they probably could get the original film and correct this and release it on Blu-Ray. If they did I would crank the rating up to four or five stars.
4,Godzilla First Fight,For one this is OOP movie and if you have dont sell it or give it away as you can tell by the use prices.This is a must have G flick movie.Not alot of people saw this movie because its been OOP for a while lucklly i bought this when I was a kid.This movie is very entertaining to watch I mean godzilla duking it out with Angilus!Later in the series Angilus is godzilla friend.This movie keeps you on your toes i mean the moster fight was great and my of my angilus can sure throw down.But the moviebegins with a pilot saw 2 monster fighting on an island and soonor later there in japan fighting it out until godzilla soons getthe upper hand and kills anglius with fire breath *SPOILER*.Soon the people trap godzilla in the moutain which they bury him in ice.The only downfall is Godzilla kinda looks goofy but its all good but I recommend you get this hard to obtain G flick.
3,Godzilla Raids Again,"Godzilla Raids again was the last black-n-white Godzilla movie and as such, has a unique charm to it. It is a fun movie as viewers get introduced to a second giant monster. The battle royale is as much to watch today as it was when I first saw the movie.The movie was delivered on time and in the condition that it was promised."
3,Better Than Most Fast-Buck Sequels,"Unlike its historic predecessor, ""Godzilla Raids Again"" (1955) is totally content with being a B-grade monster movie. On that level, the quickie sequel remains fairly entertaining. In fact, the production would have fared better if Toho invested a little more time and money. Though Eiji Tsuburaya's special effects run hot and cold, ""Raids Again"" delivers plenty of Godzilla for the buck. Watch the original Japanese-language version and by all means avoid the badly dubbed American re-edit."
3,Decent Sequel PUSHED BACK AGAIN,Pushed back AGAIN! This is getting REDICULOUS.Do they really think there will be an interest in this and other 1950's films in 2025.If you have the VHS copies keep them because this is all we are going to have until the company releasing these titles get their act together.
4,a hard to find film on dvd and a musthave for Godzilla fans,"when this movie was released here in the states for distribution warner brothers was the distributor and the directors sued to keep it from being distributed by warner bro.It is considered an unoficial godzilla movie thats why the monster names are diff from the official godzilla movies. if you are a godzilla fan this is a must have along with godzilla 85, Godzilla vs. biolante and the not yet released for home mothra reborn 3 and the final war ."
2,Godzilla's back!,"This is the 2nd Godzilla movie ever, but it isn't as good as the original.POSITIVES:1. Godzilla's first monster battle!2. The monster battles are some of the best (They accidentlly undercranked the camera instead of overcranking it!).3. Anguirus's first appearence.NEGATIVES:1. Bad acting.2. Godzilla sounds like Anguirus more often then himself.3. GIGANTIS??????!!!!!!!!!!If I could, I would give this film 2 and a half stars."
2,The kids won't like it,"This is the first godzilla sequel. It sticks to the anti-nuclear theme. There are scenes which more clearly show Godzilla as an actual metaphore for nuclear war. Buy it for yourself, the kids won't like it as much as ""Godzilla's Revenge"""
3,Slow and confusing,"When I got this movie I was hoping that it would care more about action than anything else, but the story is so wierd, including the romance, made the movie extremely confusing and really dull. the movie seems to go on FOREVER! And half the time I didn't know what was going on. If you're a major Godzilla fan, get it. If not, you don't need to."
4,Second best christmas present,I ordered this as a christmas present for my son and he loves it! So this was added to his collection.
3,"""Godzilla Raids Again"" is for Gojira completists","The title of my little blurb says almost all of it. This is the Japanese original of what was released to U.S. television as ""Gigantis The Fire Monster,"" with American English dubbing. I saw it decades ago as a kid, when the destruction and mayhem seemed a lot more impressive. Now I'm just completely conscious of the guys inside the monster suits, and one of the cool things about this edition is the documentary included about those intrepid thespians. This, along with the original ""Gojira"" and its American companion release, is the early history of Godzilla and has intrinsic value for that reason, pretty much alone."
3,Japanese version much better than American,"I got this DVD as part of the Godzilla collection, and I was so happy that they included the original Japanese release with English subtitles. I had the American version on VHS and never really liked it. The American version mutilated the monster sounds by having Godzilla (which was renamed Gigantis, dumb!) sound like Angalus and vice versa. They also striped some of the music. The Japanese version has the sounds correct. I did find it unusual that the fight scenes where fast action, as opposed to the slower action in all the other Godzilla movies. It's not one of my favorites, but it's OK. The soundtrack isn't as good as the other movies and I think it's the lamest Godzilla suit in the early years. The subtitle have some minor translation errors, but it I got a kick out of it."
3,Dual versions,"This is the first time I have seen the Japanese verion of this movie and I find it is much better than the US version released as Gigantis, The Fire Monster. It doesn't have the hokey scenes of early Earth and if far more enjoyable even tho you have to read the subtitles.I also recently got Gojira and the original is 100 times better than the Raymond Burr version."
4,excellent knife!,"incredibly sharp, cut through vegetables and produce like butter. i don't know if it's my cutting board or the knife itself, but i feel like the knife sticks a bit more to the board than i want it to (can't get a smooth slicing motion through); probably from it being sharp enough that it's cutting the board too!beautiful product, it was a steal at $65."
5,No longer young - but learning Swedish!,"I am certainly no longer one of the young ones but I am enjoying learning Swedish. I have 2 books - Vera Croghan's book and CDs for pronunciation but Gladys Hird's Grammar Book to learn all the rules and exceptions, etc. etc. I find it is great fun. I've just returned from a longish holiday in Sweden and will be there again next year following my 80th Birthday. and I am determined to be speaking and understanding enough Swedish to make my stay even more enjoyable. This Grammar Book is excellent. It is written by the lady who was my husband's Swedish teacher at University while Vera Croghan taught my daughter and so I feel justified in using both!"
5,A must have for learning Swedish,"Over the last few years I have purchased a large number of books on the Swedish language. Each of these books have helped but until finding this book there has been no other book that I would class as being a must have for anyone contemplating learning Swedish.As I have been learning the language on and off for a number of years and have lived, worked and studied in Sweden during this time I can not say if it is a suitable text for the complete beginner on its own. But I can say that even at its high price it is a very good and very essential book for anyone that wants to learn Swedish in a manner simular to the methods taught within Sweden for immigrants.Anyone contemplating learning Swedish can really benefit from reading well designed Swedish stories such as found in this book as it is able to give a little bit of history and understanding of the day to day Swedish life as well as giving an overall well designed approach to learning the language."
5,These guys are amazing,"I also saw these guys live at the Iridium in NYC and they simply blew me, along with the rest of the club, away. One of the best tandems in jazz you will ever hear, they play off of each other so well with a series of collabrative and competive jams. The simple track recording keeps the raw, live feel to thier music. Just an outstanding album."
3,Kind of red,"3 1/2Kindred doesn't have binding raw ambition which made the amazing vibraphone player's next few recordings so memorable, but between some progressively powerful poignancy and muted musical mellowness is a daringly dynamic duo appeasing both sides of the fence."
3,Useful if small footprint is most important,"This keyboard is useful only if the small footprint (11 1/4 x 5 5/8"") is of paramount importance. It is achieved by (1) leaving off the numeric keypad (an excellent idea) and (2) rearranging the right side of the main keys (not so good). The control keys one expects to find there are in unfamiliar locations (not to say: badly mixed up), and many of them have only half the width (which makes them hard to hit).I use this keypad with a PC that is dedicated to the reception of movies over the internet, and the only key I need regularly is ESC; for this job it's just fine."
5,LOVE IT,WE GOT THIS MOVIE FAST. I LOOKED EVERYWHERE IN TOWN AND COULDN'T FIND IT. BUT EVEN IF THEY HAD HAD IT IN STOCK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 15 DOLLARS MORE. THIS IS AN AWESOME SEASON OF THE SHIELD. FOR ALL THE SHIELD LOVERS ITS A MUST BUY!
1,The Shield Season 4,"I bought The Shield Season 4. I had already bought Seasons 2 and 3. I had been very happy with the purchases,however, when I got ready to watch the third disk of Season 4 it did not work.(It had not been removed from the case until I put it in the player.) I even took it to a video store and had the disk polished to remove any scratches. It still did not work. I am very disappointed."
5,The Shield - The Complete Fourth Season,"As always, The Shield never disapoints. Action pacted and full of attitude!"
4,The Shield The complete Four season,"This is the police detective drama. Produce by Fox Television series.I clasified this item in 4 star because the first three season are the best than the fourth season, but in this season you obtain the continuity and plot that I think conclude in the season five. If you dicide to by this product you can get the best police detective dramma than you ever get.I hope this commentary will help you."
1,Hard Hitting Action,As usual the Shield continues its haphazard saga along the edge of law and order. So far in my opinion this continues to be one of the better cop dramas out there and i would highly reccomend this to fans of previous Shield Series. You won't be dissapointed
1,The Shield-DVD Zone Fraud,"I wouldn't know how the Shield rates.Despite the fact that clearly stated that I live in Australia, otherwise known as Zone 4, I was delivered disks playable only in Zone 1, otherwise known as America.I have paid a reasonable price which I assume includes royalty fees for the creators and owners of the Shield intelectual property plus any taxes due, and I still can't use the product.When the goods arrived, the only way of determining the zone configuration was to open them. This, of course, means that goods cant be returned.Happy with the product? Oh, you bet."
5,One of the best series ever just gets better,"Being based in Europe and having to import this series on Region 1 due to the unbelievable fact that Fox still haven't got around to issuing anything after seasons 1 and 2 over here, all I can say is thank goodness for multi-region players and international postage!It's even worth the import duties that the government cunningly whacks on the top. The Shield just gets better and dishes up shocks and surprises like few other series can offer. It's great to enjoy an American drama that, like The Sopranos but definitely not like 24, Lost or Prison Break does not feel the need to spoon-feed its viewers and help them get the point. In other words a series where you need to use your brain and it rewards you for repeat viewings. And isn't that the beauty of DVD? That you can enjoy watching episodes more than once?Don't hesitate to buy this."
5,As good as always,"Loved it..... but I loved them all. I don't want to give it away, since it is a soap opera, but I had my doubts about Glenn Close acting in this role but she nailed it. I am always reticent with massive plot twists, or fearing losing my favorite characters, but this one left me feeling very satisfied..... Long live the strike team!"
2,description not accurate,"Disk three of Sheild season #4 skips around like a school girl on the playground. Very disappointed. My wife is pregnate and THE SHEILD has become her favorite thing to watch at home, and now four episodes are not available to us. I only buy products labeled good, very good, or like new. Therefore I expect them to work."
5,"I've said it before, I'll say it again. This is great TV","This show keeps getting better. It's a gripping show that I love (I think I have seen every episode since Season 1). I think it may have had a slight slump prior to Glenn Close coming on set, but it sure picked up again and is back at its peak. It's raw, gritty, emotional and heart pumping. Michael Chiklis is superb and his story lines keep getting more and more intense. It's always so well written and a must see for anyone who loves a good cop drama that's often dark but moving and thrilling."
3,The Shield-The Complete fourth Season,"I love the show and that is why I knew that what they said were deleted scenes, were not deleted ( or almost all ) 0n the seen on T.V. shows. So it was a disappointment to me to go back and see important parts later.Vicki H"
2,They gotta do better for season 5.,"This was probably the weakest of the four seasons. They tried to make it work with many many subplots, but it just didn't mesh this year.Wasn't a big fan of Antwan Mitchell either. Not the greatest villian in the world. He had nothin on Armadillo (arm-a-dee-o) from season 2.I've just become so used to havin those ""OHHH DAAAMN"" moments watchin this show, this season just didn't produce any emotion from me. Maybe two or three episodes at most. Hopefully they'll recapture the magic of season 1 & 2 next year. Btw, people bash season 3, but I liked it. Good storyline, good actin, good action. What more do you want? Anyway, guess my order goes 2-1-3-4.Also, I agree that Tony Soprano is the best character on tv. He just has so many layers it's great. Then Vic Mackey, then Jed Bartlet. That's my two cents."
3,Required Reading,"This was a very expensive book that I HAD to have for a graduate class I never wanted to take, but is required by law. The tuition and books are literally using the last cent I own. There is something wrong with the world when a math teacher HAS to take a reading graduate class just to keep a part-time job. I already have a Masters too, so it's just a huge, expensive waste of time.I am sure the book does what it is supposed to do, but who would buy it for light reading, it's a textbook, plain and simple."
3,Good Book,"The book itself is very informative, although the photos are of inferior quality. Is is very disappointing to see that the photos were not considered to be important enough to reproduce them with a good quality, rather than as if someone ran them off in a copy machine."
4,WWE: Greatest Stars of the 90's,ithink its a great dvd in regards the great stars of 90's. great run down on all the stars. great matches between the superstars but being a hulk hogan fan would of liked to see matches he won. got to see some matches i never seen especially from wcw. sit back and enjoy
5,Worth Watching,"I just got finished watching the main doc. on disc one, I was blown away how well it was put together. I recommend this dvd set to any fan of pro wrestling past or present. This set is alot better then the prev. released superstars of the 80s. 5 Stars"
5,The best of 2009,"In my opinion, this the best DVD of 2009. Cool bios of guys you never hear about (Yokozuna, Lex Luger, Sting) and great matches."
3,This DVD is okay...,"An okay wrestling DVD... could have been a tad better. Recommend it for serious wrestling fans only or anyone who missed 1990's pro wrestling. Really, when you stop and think about it, this dvd should have been called ""The Greatest Stars of the LATE 90's"". As the early and mid nineties lacked star power."
5,Life Saver!!!,"We moved into our home 11years ago and I purchased this little gem...First off let me say...shame on me for never testing the charge. The box was completely sealed, thank God we never had to use it. Until 12/25/11, while making popovers in a muffin tin (not advisable, by the way) the dripping/fat spilled over the pans, into the botton pan of my oven, going under the floor of the oven an going up in flames. I reached for the fire extinguiser and DONE...fire was out in a few seconds...Ordered my replacement extinguisher and one for my daghter in her new apartment. so greatful for such an amazing product."
5,Great Kitchen fire extimguisher,"Nice. It packed very well. I got it for my kitchen. I hope never have to use it, but in case of a fire you needto ready to fight the fire! Easy to hang up and easy to test the pressure. :)"
3,It's tiny!,"This product has great reviews which is why I bought it.But when it arrived, it was TINY! I almost felt cheated. It's compact so I'll give it that, it'll probably do the job, but for 20 bucks (including shipping) I found a FULL size kitchen extinguisher at Target (for a buck less) which is not just bigger but also can deal with class A fires.So if you're looking for something to push into the corner under the sink, this is great. If you have the space, I'd say goto target and buy the First full size for the same price (and it's rechargeable)."
4,I wish I could find Lenny Dee on cd he's a great organist,"It was ok I wish I could find Lenny Dee on cd, he's a great organist"
2,Cocktail Music Lover,"I have been a Sinatra/Martin/Basie, etc. fan for many years. Good cocktail music is my pride and joy. This CD was just a little too ""out there"" to enjoy. However, the art work of the album is a classic. Sorry!"
5,How to keep your body refreshed.,"Well, it is surely a good thing to see that the human body can stay in form, using this product with diet and some excercise.This product is helping me feel no discomfort in my fingers and toes, that happens every time it gets cold. My hands used to get so crampy, and it is so much less, I do not even use gloives that often in cold weather.Ths skin in my neck ( at 44) is now more tight, more tense, smooth and firm and only recently, you could pinch it, and the skin would not get back into place quickly.Only if we have a perfect life, with zero problems, could we keep healthy easier, but life is not like that for every time more and more people.Neither is this product costly, and I am am medical doctor, who works in Mexico, and I know what I am saying. This is a safe, secure product, and you get better results the earlier you start. It is always easier to prevent, than to cure."
1,Mel,"I did try this product for a week but I had to stop because developed alergic reaction, my troat was almost bloqued, probably from some of component in it."
2,Hesitant to continue taking it.,"I stop taking this after a week, since I noticed one for the ingredients is Magnesium sterate (toxic to the liver). Besides, I read the recommended doses is 2 tablets per day on an empty stomach. Not a fan of that."
1,Skin broke out,"I did not like this product at all. I was hoping to have more energy and I did not. Also, I have redness in my skin, also called Rosacea. This product made my skin break out terribly."
3,It's pretty good,"There are only 3 songs I like on this CD--the one by Tono ""el cuco"" Rosario, the bachata from Los Toros Band (my favorite group aside from antony santos), and the duet of Kinito Mendez and Celia Cruz! The other songs either I already had or didn't like. But I like the cd though."
2,A Book or a long list?,I am a huge Bukowski fan but this book seemed to list stories and events in a very akward manner. It had great detail and I learned alot about Buk but if given the chance I would have rather have read 15 essays on Charles Bukowski then have to read this book again.
2,Not the best,Ihsve tried other brands before trying this brand. I did so because of the lower cost. With the lower cost comes lower quality. It is too hard to snap on a bag. It dies not have a good seal when it comes in contact with your body. I have gone back to the other brands that I know and trust.
2,Careful in the laundry!,"I love this jersey, but I washed and dried it on low as instructed and the poor shirt suffered paint loss. I returned it and got my refund, but it is disappointing! I will wash my new jersey inside out and air dry it. Live and learn, I guess!"
2,Crappy Service,"Apparently expedited means nothing because my package arrived late. If you're going to order anything from this company, make sure you don't want to have it a week or more."
2,You've got to be kidding if you think this is quality....,"I purchased this based upon the other reviews which all seemed to be excellent. Well, the jersey is average at best. For the dollars spent, you can do much better elseware. Nothing special at all and fell FAR BELOW my expectations. Graphics weren't all that great, stitching is poor, and I paid extra for a larger size, but you would never have known it. The size runs small. I'm returning mine immediately.... I like Aaron Rodgers as much as the next Packer fan but c'mon people... do you work for Raebok?"
2,Disappointed,I bought this jersey for my husband for his brithday. I was under the impression the jersey was Reebok's replica series. Instead I recieved a knock off of Reebok's Authentic series jersey. My husband knew as soon as he looked at it that it was fake. The NFL patch was instantly noticeable that it was not a Reebok quality brand. I would not recommend this jersey if you are looking for a true Reebok replica jersey. The biggest disappointment is that we were mislead on what the product actually was.
5,Very impressed!,"The price made me nervous because I thought it was too good to be true, but when I received it, it was EXCATLY what I wanted! Thank you!"
5,better than expected,"There are quite a few low rating postings for this jersey and I think those ratings gave me low expectations of what I had ordered. However, I was pleasantly surprised when the jersey arrived. I got the quality of what I was hoping for. The jersey is great and my girlfriend (I bought it for her) loved it."
2,Letters and Numbers,I don't like the letters and numbers on this jersey. I have other replica jerseys and on those the letters and numbers are thicker. On this jersey it almost looks they are it's painted on. I just got the jersey so I haven't washed it yet. I'm afraid if I do the letters and numbers will wash off. Other then that the actual jersey is fine.
3,Not quite what I expected,"I ordered this Jersey to update the collection of Packer jerseys I do have. The one in the picture(Premier) is what I was expecting, but the Jersey I got was not the one in the picture. The jersey I received was the lesser(Replica) quality one.The jersey pictured is the Premier and the Replica is what I got. Just read the print and know the difference. Lesson learned."
1,Jersey,The jersey arrived 4 days after it was supposed to. No call or e mail to tell me why it was delayed. It was a Christmas gift but arrived long after Christmas. It wasn't even mailed until the last possible arrival date. Very disappointed in service.
1,Counterfeit,"Since all jerseys are sold out locally, I ordered this one instead of taking a chance on E-bay. The jersey I received looks like it was sewn by a child. Horrible quality. I did a little research, and found that it is actually counterfeit, and not actually made by reebok. It's only made to poorly resemble the genuine product. I contacted Amazon about this, and they don't seem to care. Boo to you, Amazon, for supporting these illegal sales!"
2,packets replica jersey,The jersey looks nice in the photo but it really is a cheap knock off. It was barely sewn together in 2 spots and needed an immediate stitching before wearing. For the money paid - it was not worth it.
5,"the adhesive is waterproof, though this bandaid is overpriced","the adhesive on this bandaid is very good despite the sheer strips being over priced when the 1 inch wide sheer strip is priced lower, supposedly the ""new"" waffle pad pushes the price higher, its a marketing ""gimmick"" in my opinion"
3,Good deal for 3.49 - not best Band-Aid product though,"I'm a big fan of Band-Aid products. I like this one for the size of the band-aids, as this size tends to get used up before other sizes.The main issue with this particular model is the strange stickiness of the bandaids. They leave goo on your skin after taking them off and they don't breathe like the others.On the other hand, the price is right. Can't beat $3.49 including delivery."
3,Not Band-Aid quality,"These Band-Aids seem thinner than the ones I am used to and do not seem to be as high quality. They seem to melt on the skin and are hard to get off at times. I guess that's what comes from buying a large quantity (I bought 400) to save money, only to find the trade-off is lower quality. But they work."
2,won't stay on!,"peels away will not stick, have to change them too often, will not buy again. The Tough Strips much better."
2,Minimal Cotton Tip,Received this item out of box in a flat rate envelope. Swabs were made in China and the wood seemed of poor quality with frequent breaks and the cotton application tip was quite thin.I would NOT purchase this brand again!
1,Is this a joke? An EMPTY COLLAPSED BOX WAS SENT TO ME!,"This got to be a joke!They sent me the product (Suppose to be 1000 Q-tips) in A USPS FLAT (!!!) rate Mailing Envelope.Inside the envelope, it's an EMPTY COLLAPSED Packing with ABSOLUTELY NOTHING inside!I would like to give them the benefit of doubt that this is a shipping error but seriously who in the right frame of mind would throw $10 out there so to get an empty box of nothing?The seller is DIRECT CARE STORE in Houston, TX"
5,Read this one out loud,"Claire Koshar provides us with a quirky look behind, above and below the scene of dog sports with an easy style and a quiet sense of humor. Ms. Koshar opens the interesting world of competition preparation and shows us the essence of living and working with dogs as the pearl inside. Filled with anecdotes from her years of experience with dogs, this book is one to be read out loud and savored among your DBs (""Dogbuddies"") and, in fact, any FODs (""Friends of Dogs"") you might happen to know. She proves that not only isn't winning everything, it isn't even the battle."
1,A mess,"This thing stinks. It was recommended as a ""custom-fit"" product for my specific vehicle -- a 1984 Toyota 4WD Pickup. On attempting installation, I found that it was not customized at all, and wasn't even a remotely close fit between the 5-speed shifter and the 4WD shifter. The material quality is lacking as well. What a mess."
4,Very good,"I recommend this product if you need some protection to you laptop. It is strong and has a sleek design. However, I wonder if the 15"" version would fit better my macbook pro 15.4"" without leaving an empty space at the top. The width is perfect, though."
1,Waste of Money.,Runs perfect. Easy to set up. Doesn't need much space. Plus the cars are quite detailed. This is a very nice way to start model rail roading. Highly recommended.Update... junk! Broke a few months later with little use.
4,Just What He Wanted,My eleven yr old nephew was thrilled to get what he wanted-a train! He was able to quickly assemble the train to Mom's pleasant surprise. He does state that the train will stop1/10 of the time for unknown reasons. It must be noted that theBachmann Trains Thunder Valley Ready-to-Run N Scale Train Setis still highly valued a month after he rec'd it for his Christmas gift.
1,I should have expected this from Bachmann,"The train was priced very low and that should have given me a clue as to it's quality. The couplers are the cheap, plastic type that are very hard to get coupled to begin with and then after several trips around the oval they mysteriously disconnect themselves. I spent the entire time that I ran the train, re-coupling the cars. You get what you pay for. This set will go on Craigslist very soon."
1,Not As Advertized,"Order this product and you will get something else. I called them and this item is no longer produced. Therefore, they sent something else which is totally differenty. Beware!!"
5,Great Admiration,"Only those who suffer really know the pain and desperation. I lost the love of my life who suffered terribly. I truly admire people like Shelley who want to make a genuine positive contribution to her fellow fibro sufferers and regain a sense of self worth which is all too often worn away by the relentless pain. To those of you who are living with people with fibromyalgia, I wish for you, continued strength and hope. For you Shelley, I wish you continued success with you book and peace."
5,WOW!,"This is some great Coffee:) Perks you up & gets you moving. A good tasting, highly energized morning wake up:) Even better as an afternoon pick me up. Even thinking about making coffee now just wakes me up."
3,better than store bought,"I am a big fan of Coffee. Other than water it's all I drink.I do enjoy the high quality coffee that only mail order or very pricy stores can deliver. But as far as a bulk style coffee goes, this is the stuff to buy.Its neither flavored nor sweetened like store coffee, which is a relief, but with a ton of Caffeine which can't be a bad thing.Over all it's a good coffee, I am not sure I would brew it everyday, but I do brew more than few pots on the weekends."
5,Great Album,Sarah Brightman's voice in incredible! This is a must have for any serious music collection. You will not be disappointed.
2,doesn't live up to its promise,"I bought this based on the other reviews, but I was really disappointed. The pace of the sandman song is way too peppy to use this as a bedtime cd. Also, who knew Richard Carpenter had a LISP? It sounds like a parody. This is sitting on our shelf, unplayed. Check out the other lullaby collections, but give this one a miss."
5,A thorough reference book on Eastern spirituality.,"An excellent source for reference or just casual reading, ""The Encyclopedia of Eastern Philosophy and Religion"" is more often than not the first book I turn to when looking for a description of anything from ""Advaita"" to ""Zazen."" More than just a collection of terms on Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism and Zen, this book covers a wide variety of teachers and esoteric wisdom. Rarely have I been stumped when looking to this tome for a word. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in spirituality."
3,A Very Entertaining Book,"This book gave some great insight to the Cowboys (mostly Jerry, Barry & Troy) and their situation with Jimmy Johnson & Barry Switzer. Comical at times, it kept me wanting to read on. Although this team is almost always in the media, this book gave insights that you would never hear about on the radio or TV. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The only thing that I didn't enjoy is the fact that it felt a bit too much like hearing gossip from a friend who knows too much."
2,Skip's Bent Views,"A very intersting book for Cowboys fans. The access that Bayless was given during this championship run gives readers a unique insight about the ups and downs of a football season. However, as in his two previous books, Bayless makes himself too much of a part of the story, trying to make it seem as if he's more important than he really is. He also continuued a pattern of going overboard with innuendos, in this case potentially damaging the reputation of Troy Aikman. Skip always thinks it's necessary to combine football with National Enquire type material, and in this case it ruined what had the potential to be a great book and essentially ended his career in Dallas and on ESPN."
3,It's ok.,Wasn't what I had expected. It is good for teaching children. I am an adult and I didn't enjoy learning this way.
1,A Few Good Songs and Lots of Awful Ones,"The first 4 songs are actually hits, but the rest were just mediocre wanna-be rap I really never heard before. The title of this CD is misleading. I didn't like it and resold it to a CD store after playing it only once."
3,Academy Award Winning Songs: Vol. 3 1958-1969,These albums get better as they go along because more and more they use the original recording of the song from the film rather than a cover by some other artist.
2,What mean music!,"The band is good, but all the songs sound the same and the lyrics are pointless and hateful. I got this CD because I have and like one of their songs, ""Billy's Dead"" (not on this CD), but if this is their greatest hits, the rest must be pretty sad. Unless you are an angry sociopath, you'll probably want to listen to something else."
1,Snore,"A great cd if you're a bored, toothless, meth-freak!! Maybe they ought to work on their GED's, and then try learning to play their instruments as well, my ten year old's garage band would mop up the floor with these imbeciles!!"
2,terrible,"When I bought this book I thought it would be a story about Guinevere being torn between two men. As far as I can see she didn't love Arthur at all. As another reviewer said, she's spoiled, selfish and an airhead. Lancelot also gets on my nerves. Ugh. I am disappointed in this book because most of the other novels that I've read that involve the Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot love triangle are at least interesting. This one wasn't, sadly."
4,Ball Chain License Frame,"This frame is pretty cool! I haven't seen another frame like this where I live, so it's unique to say the least. I had to buy a different set of screws for the frame to fit on my car, That was a simple trip to the hardware store. Go ahead and buy it, it's very well made. :)"
3,TOO MUCH RELYING ON POLES AND EXTENSIVE ICE,A FINE PIECE OF LITERATURE BUT CONTAINS OUTDATED MATERIAL......WANTS US TO BELIEVE THAT LARGE ICE CAPS CAUSE MASS CATACLYSMS AND FAILS TO BRING INTO ACCOUNT POSSIBLE OUTSIDE FORCES....
4,"Not quite 32"", but great for this fibromyalgia gal.","This is the shortest folding cane around, but nearly 33"" (despite the duro-med published data). I'm 5'3"" and, with shoes, need just over a 32"" cane. In order to make it as short as possible, I had to press the button and shove the screwy nut thingy as low as possible and twist the top down onto it (so the gold button is 1"" above the shortest hole and therefore not visible). If I want it shorter, I'll have to remove the bottom and cut an inch or two off, but it'll do.On the other hand, the handle is very comfortable and the cane has a thin profile, so it will be great for navigating the airport as well as attending the wedding I'm going to this weekend. I'm satisfied, and wish it came in other colors :)"
5,Light and helpful,"I love that it ""snaps"" into shape by itself and folds if needed (let's say in the car)Light weight is a plus. Looks sleek and matches my style :DFast shipping too"
3,Paper Monsters,"Well,an average album, nothing particular.IMHO, it doesn't have too much DM feel in it. To be frank, I think Martin L. Gore knows what makes Dave sounds great.Anyways, this is a Dave Album not a DM one, so I guess we'll learn to accept the real Gahan. There's something in the songs, but they need to be further worked on. It seems that Dave find the start but didn't really finish them. Well, since this is the debut, we'll see what he can give us in the future.A rating of 3 stars is given for his effort."
3,"Not brilliant, but OK","Well, I am thankful that Martin Gore and Dave Gahan work together to form the great sound of Depeche Mode. This album clearly shows that the individual members of DM are less than the whole.This album has too many slow songs for my tastes. I thought Dave was going to come out with more of a Rock album but this album really puts me to sleep.The lyrics are very bad at times, and OK during others. The melodies also struggle. I really like Dirty Sticky Floors but none of the other songs show the same aggression.Bring on the next Depeche Mode album!"
3,CD/ DVD ???????? I only got the CD,When I order this album I was expecting a CD/DVD combo but I only recieved the CD I was a little dissapointed because it was my understanding this was suppose to be a CD/DVD........
3,calculated independence,"Joe Cropper gave a perfect desription of this album: DM but half the calories and half the taste.If Paper Monsters had to prove that Dave Gahan can write songs, well it does prove it - he can write songs. Fine. Provided some money and outside mucical assistance - msny people can. What I was most interested in this release was - what is that special thing that Dave can bring about that separates him from DM. And I could not find it.Honesty is sowhat missing. Yes, there is loads of honesty as far as lyrics are concerned - may be too much and maybe too straightforward. But musically? Dirty Sticky Floors to me is just an epitome of how calculated one can become in an attempt for a hit single. Recycled DM. Otherwise - it is all over the place (U2, Cure , Sigur Ros, you name it) and just saved and made at least coheren by a very good production work.Thanks to that 3 stars but it is the max one with open ears and an open mind can give."
3,Songs of Waste & Destitution,"Dave Gahan, lead singer of Depeche Mode, write about what he knows best on ""Paper Monsters""--addiction, depression, lying, denial, lust and abuse. All themes Depeche Mode have previously covered. Sure, ""Dirty Sticky Floors"", ""Bottle Living"", ""I Need You"" and ""Stay"" all have memorable qualities and could be alternative hits. But Dave doesn't stray too far from the Depeche Mode formula here, and although the music is fine, it's fairly insignificant--like an appetizer before the next Depeche Mode release. He could have stretched himself artistically, but self-absorbtion (probably what causes him problems in the first place) wins out on this recording. This and Depeche Mode's ""Exciter"" are a bit of a let down when you think about what has come before. Only if you are a Depeche Mode completist should you attempt ""Paper Monsters"". I'd say wait for the next Depeche Mode cd, you won't miss that much."
2,Paper Monsters - Rough Draft??,"I'm writing this b/c I disagree with what i've read of the reviews. I'm a very big Depeche Mode fan, and I think Dave Gahan has more potential than what this album displays. Not only does it drag on and on with the same bland style of music, but the lyrics are poor. There's no poetry and/or insight to any of the verses.......they're more like bad nursery rhymes. And I dont think its Gahan's fault entirely. It sounds like someone didnt look into this project, collaborate and direct it properly. My expectations were that he was going to pursue some new directions....maybe do some non-synth oriented. Instead, you get a can of Diet Depeche Mode. Half the calories with half the taste."
1,Don't Buy This CD!,"This album is being promoted as being from the former ""front man"" of Depeche Mode. Therefore, I purchased it thinking that it would have at least a modest level of the Depeche Mode sound. It doesn't. There is not a single track on this album that I was even remotely impressed with and it certainly bears little resemblance to the music of Depeche Mode. Luckily, I purchased it with a gift certificate so I didn't feel completely robbed after having purchased it."
3,Dave Gahan still trying to be a rock star,"UGH! Okay, Dave, I'm sure you don't read these reviews, but in case you happen to stumble across them on a bored evening, READ THIS: PLEASE STOP TRYING TO BE A ROCK STAR! You were born to be the ""prince of synth"" and you should be proud of that title! How about releasing a rollicking dance album, you know, something that will make us all think yet get up and move around? There is a lot of genuine heart in this album and it would work even better if you hired any old DJ to mix it up a bit and make it fun. Wait a second, it would sound like...DEPECHE MODE! More fun the next time, okay?"
4,Not Depeche Mode but a great solo debut album,"I am a huge Depeche Mode fan, So when this album came out I had to get it and all I have to say is that it is not Depeche Mode, it is not the best album I have heard lyrically but it sounds great, has great energy and is one of these albums you have to turn up loud and blast out. No its not Depeche Mode, but a great debut from a performer who can only get better and better with or without Depeche Mode. I hope with, but in between Depeche Mode projects he will only improve!"
4,I liked this album,"I personally thought this album was a tribute to the growth of Dave Gahan both in his music and his personal experiences. Granted it doesn't carry the same dark and moody feel as the early DM albums, but I see that as a good thing. This is his way of breaking away from the image he has as the lead singer of DM. It's also a personal look at the struggles he's been through and what he's overcome. It's like getting a look into the man behind the music and fame. The tunes are catchy, the beats will move you."
4,Dave's World,"Very different from DM. But quite enjoyable all the same. Difficult to listen to often due to a fair ammount of dark songs, but if you sit with it and let it sink in you will not be dissapointed. ""Hidden Houses"" sounds the most like DM to me, Dave's majestic voice singing over a Cure like bassline. ""Stay"" and""Hold On"" beautiful and and uplifting lullaby type songs, very similar to ""Exciter""'s ""Goodnight Lovers"". All in all a very consistent and great record. I look forward to Dave's future solo albums and to the new DM album in the future. If these guys make another one I see good things to come."
2,what did you expect?,"There has been a lot of talk over the years about the fact that it was only Martin Gore who had songs represented on Depeche Modes albums. Well here is why! There is not one single song on this album that really leaves an impression on the listener. Several of them are okay and can be heard more than once. But the majority seems to disappear after you have heard them once. The production is absolutely great and lifts several of the tracks a little bit higher, but the album does not come anywhere near Depeche Mode or Martin gores soloalbums!! The absolutely worst thing about this album is the lyrics, they really drag the whole thing down. If only Gahan had asked someone else to them, I would probably had given this album an extra star!! Sorry Dave!!!"
1,Greatly disappointed!!!,I did not get what I ordered at all. I ordered the 3-step treatment form and rec'd the 2-step treatment form. Very misleading advertising. I would not order anything from them again.
1,The 1-step version blows,"The original version with the dropper is great! But this version with the pre-moistened applicator totally sucks. With the original version, you put a few drops on, and there is plenty to cover a skin crack. But the pre-moistened variety must have barely a quarter drop in it. It practically evaporates dry between the time you open the package and bring it to your skin."
4,Product note,"Note that this vendor can no longer obtain the two-part liquid bandage.This is now the same quick applicator sold by other vendors. Works ok,just not as much product available per application."
1,Bandage review,"This is a new style of liguid bandage, The swab is pre-moistened (barely wet!!) Prefer the old product, hat had a separate bottle of activator, which was then applied to the swab..got MUCH wetter and easier to apply to a cut."
2,"Bought original product; got substitute, which sucks","I thought the first version of this product was sent from heaven. Use dropper bottle to moisten dry sticks before applying. This version with the pre-prepared moistened sticks just doesn't work. The stick is barely moist enough when you open the packet and it just leaves a gooey thing on your skin; not the invisible, smooth cover of the previous version. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD STUFF?"
3,mixed feelings,positve:doesn't stain like other self tannersdoesn't smell quite as bad as other tannerseasy to applynegative:doesn't last as long as other self tannersyou have to apply a lot of coats in order to see the color which makes the can not last too longAll in all I would not buy this self tanner again.
3,Good Customer Service,"I LOVE this Bliss Tan For All Seasons... first time ordering it here. I usually pick it up at a local cosmetic store, but was ordering in advance and wanted to save a little. First bottle arrived and it was almost a year expired... bummer. They did reship me a new bottle right away though. Only knew to check the date because I've purchased an expired one before that was the wrong color when it sprayed out and I am NOT willing to have a faulty color product on my skin and take the chance it doesn't turn me some funky color. So, came expired... but did fix ASAP. Overall time was almost a month due to Storm Sandy shipping issues, which I understand."
4,My son loves it!,I got this one and the one's below for my son. He enjoys building things and I believe its very educational and inspires creative thinking.Worth the price.Knex Value Tub 400 piecesKnex Value Tub 400 piecesK'nex Wheel Action 10 Model Building Set- 154 pcs
3,It's an OK product for kids.,"I purchased this product for my 5 yr. old grandson because he enjoys building with Lego blocks. I thought this would give him more interesting choices of things to make. Unfotunately, they pieces are very hard to create with. The diagrams sent with the product to make things are not very helpful either, even for an adult. I wouldn't recommend this for a child under the age of 10yrs."
1,our third one - but not for good reasons,"We bought this gate and loved it at first until it broke, the wood split on a seem that wasn't glued together properly at the factory. So we returned that one a got another, well the latched just snapped and broke into a whole bunch of pieces so we brought that one back. The third one broke the same way the first one did, we won't be getting another. This gate is a piece of junk and not worth the money. It can't handle kids hanging on it the way kids do. Isn't that the whole purpose of a child safety gate? To keep your little ones out of a place that you don't want them and they are going to be on the other side of the gate trying to get in. I wouldn't NOT buy the wood one again, maybe we can try the metal one with better results."
2,"Nice to look at, but a pain to operate","This gate does look very nice and matches our golden oak woodwork in our home. That's probably the only plus I can give it. When it is pressure mounted tight enough to not slip along the wall, then it's too tight to close and lock by itself as it is supposed to. It also makes a very loud click when it does close. When it's loose enough to close itself, then it's too loose and slips back and forth along the wall. Even when it does close, the bottom is not secure and and moves back and forth when pressed upon. Not an item that I'd ever recommend."
1,Piece of garbage,"Yes, the wood finish is nice. It would have looked great in our home. But it's flimsy and not stable at all. You can extend the screws up to 3"" on each side... at 2 1/4"" it is very unstable and would never hold back a child."
1,It broke--dangerous product,"I bought this gate because it seemed sturdy and was nicer looking than most. Within 6 months, the main part of the gate fell apart and the pieces that hold it to the frame snapped. Had it been at the top of the steps instead of in the kitchen, my daughter would have fallen down the steps. Please do not waste your money on this gate."
1,Terrible,"The gate really does look nice. That's about it, though. The quality is very poor and the hinges are made of very cheap and flimsy black plastic. Because of this, it's easy to open the gate and not realize the bottom portion is still ""locked in"". This is because the plastic hinges are so flimsy that the gate door can kind of ""twist"" so that the top portion moves outward a good distance while the bottom portion is still closed. Also, the description isn't very clear (nor are the details on the box) about the extensions. The gate's advertised maximum width of 40.5"" includes the extensions.If you want a similar design with a far better build quality, get the First Years Hands Free Gate instead."
3,Great if you don't want to leave it open!,"We have two gates that keep our 1 yr old in our living room. This gate is perfect if you don't want to ever open it, however it is our gate for our dining room and can be very difficult if we are cleaning up after dinner. I thought the automatic door would be perfect for my other children, however, I do like to keep it open once in a while and then this gate can become a true pain. It works perfectly, I haven't had any problems but when I want to leave the door open and it doesn't stay open... ever! So if you are looking to have a gate that ALWAYS stays closed -- this gate is perfect, but if you have a reason to keep it open - ever, then don't buy this one. We love the Summer Extended Baby Gate, it is perfect, easy to use and can stay open or remain shut at your choosing."
4,Nice Gate,"I like the gate, very easy to install. After putting together umpteen differnt baby items, I have come to the conclusion that not all assembly instructions are created equal. These instructions were well written, and didn't read as if they were translated into english. The woodwork is nice on this unit. I have one problem, it says in the instructions that there are optional mounting cups that can be ordered on the vendor's website. I really wish they would have just included these. It couldn't be more than a 50 cent item. I need them for my installation for our particular door opening. I can't find them on thier website. I'm going to have to call them. Again, we are pleased with the function and appearance of this door."
4,"Beautiful gate, difficult install","This gate is beautiful, but the install was a bit difficult. Just finding the right distances between the right side and left side. Overall, the gate works wonderfully and is a great barrier for our daughter."
3,"not a bad product, but not the best","This gate works and looks nice, but we are more satisfied with our other type of gate, so we are returning it. You have to push a small latch, then lift up on the entire gate to open it, which is not easy when you are carrying a baby. It swings closed, but doesn't always latch. The wood looks nice and is good quality, but when you open the gate to almost 90 degrees, it makes a loud popping noise, which isn't nice if your baby is asleep. The First Years metal gate with foot pedal release is the best choice in our opinion."
5,Surf Music for the 21st Century,"This compilation re-sparked my love of instrumental surf rock. A wide variety of songs energetically played by bands who obviously grew uplistening to the traditional surf guitar masters, and also spent time listening to modern influences like punk rock, and heavy metal. All the songs are good. Favorites are Surf Pit, Sandpaper Paddles, Death of a Reventlo, King Kong, Phasing Spider Menace, and El Toro Muerto Con Queso."
2,I Was Mistaken By The Front Cover,"This album is very similar to another album that was the one I wanted, so I purchased this one by mistake. I personally didn't care for the music on this CD, only because it wasn't the album I wanted."
3,Hard Truth,These book discuses some hard fact about the financial challenges in being African American. The problem is in stating the condition and show the unfair elements of it does not bring about change. There is a need for African American to realize the conditions are what they are and only they can change the outcome.
2,Shapiro Hurts His Own Cause,"Shapiro begins his book by saying that he has ""taken creative liscence with identities and demographics, even constructing a composite or two."" Why not let the truth speak for itself?This book should begin, in big bold letters, with the following phrase ""GET OUT AND VOTE, BLACK PEOPLE!""The fact is, African Americans, for the most part, don't vote. As a result, politicians currently have very little incentive to court African American voters. Somehow, this minor detail slipped Shapiro's mind.Not a lot of credibility here.Moreoever, Shapiro grew up a middle-class white Jew. Normally this wouldn't matter, but when discussing poor black communities, I'd like to hear it from the source. I know Shapiro is well regarded, but I had a hard time with this book. His convictions have as many loopholes as the tax policies he condemns.I recommend finding a better book on Race/Economics."
1,25 page booklet stretched to 204 pages,"At first glance at the book, it appears as though it may be a great in depth look at the wealth gap in America. And even after the first chapter of this book I expected it to be. However after the first chapter, the new information was simply repeated for 15 pages using examples that are misleading, and often not even accepted by the author himself. Shapiro talks of how white families understate the amount of help they recieve, but does not even hint at being suspicious of the same answers by african americans. This book is essentialy a 25 page booklet that is stretched into a 204 page exercise in how well a thesaurus can be used"
3,"Great tool, not so great case.","I got a kit similar to this one as a present several years ago and decided to buy another to keep in the car. The handle and bits are all great quality, but the plastic holder that holds the bits inside the case is just a cheap molded plastic piece designed for packaging only, not long term use. I ended up getting some rubber holders for the bits and left the drills out. My older set has holders like the socket drivers in this one are held in with and work much better."
2,Light show,This was a big disappointment. Its a dim picture even in a dark room and not much attraction for the kid. We replaced it with a Nemo that works much better.PS 5 years later it's still working.
5,Top-notch product!,This is a great paper cutter. We had puchased a cheap plastic one from Staples and had to return it. This is good quality and works very well. Very happy with purchase.
2,I am returning mine,"I ordered this cutter and was excited to get it...good reviews... I am not sure, but it did not work for me. Once I put say an 8x10 picture and start cutting, it lifts the photo paper towards the end and then the cut is not straight. I need to put my fingers very close to the edge of the cutter holding the paer down and this is not very secured... I tried and tried, and followed instructions of putting pressure moving the handle towards the left, it was still doing the same. Cut was sharp but not straight.:( Now I need to find another one..."
3,just ok,"I replaced the one I had because, multiple cuts to one piece of paper weren't accurate. This machine tends to pull the paper into the blade as well, so you have to be really careful while cutting.It's solid enough and the blade does appear to be sharp. I waste some paper trying to get the cuts right however."
5,very satisfying,I thought I was going to buy a cheap used paper cutter on ebay but apparently the Swingline Ingento appreciates in value over time so I decided to just buy a new one for less money. The only difference I can see between this one and one from like 100 years ago is that they put a sticker with the brand name on it instead of burning the brand into the wood. It's hard to believe that the blades never need sharpening but once I used it I understood the simple self sharpening feature. I am deeply satisfied with the one made from maple instead of plastic and if you get this you will understand why. There is some thrill from childhood that comes back to you. I use this weekly to cut coupons and that task is enjoyable with this guillotine.
5,"Swingline 12"" paper trimmer",We are very pleased withe the quality of this paper trimmer. It is very heavy duty and performs as it should. I would recommend it for home or office duty. It appears to be unbreakable. It's the only trimmer we could find that is made of solid wood and not particle board.
5,The Best Choice of All.,"This paper cutter is your best choice of all others for 12 inch size.It is solid and well built.You could never wear it out, nor damage it.Forget the cheap plastic ones,they don't align well."
1,Cant cut a straight line for photos?,"I was really excited about this cutter, I thought I am going to spend some money for 12 inch maple swingline cutter. However I cant even cut a sliver off of normal piece of paper , let alone any of my photos that I intended to use this for. The blade just fold the paper back, or photo back? If I hold my hand really close to the blade and cut it will work. Does anyone know if I am doing something wrong? I am very unhappy with this cutter!"
3,Not quite the blue I expected,I had expected more of a baby blue - I had been buying a baby blue colored card stock by the sheet at the store for different projects for our wedding. For our programs though it would have been very costly to buy ~120 sheets. For the cost this is great but the color has sort of a greenish tinge to it. Maybe more noticeable bc I Have plenty of other light blue things to hold it up against. I'll use it but I don't love it.
3,"Nice paper, confusing name","Purchased this paper originally to use for invitations thinking it was vellum in a pastel blue color. Turns out this product has nothing to do with vellum, but is really just cardstock. There's no question that the paper is nice (has a pretty nice smooth finish), but it's definitely not vellum and has nothing to do with vellum.If you're looking for some nice (lighter weight) cardstock, this is the product for you. If you're looking for translucent vellum, keep searching."
5,Totally Awesome!,As a huge Red Sox fan since I was a child (I am in my late 50's)I loved this book! It traces the Red Sox quest for a World Series Championship which they could not win for 86 Years!A story for all ages. I gave this as a gift to more than 10 people last year and I just purchased two more for gifts this year. A wonderful story for all baseball fans.
4,Good and you don't have to be a red sox fan (but it helps!),"The pictures are wonderful and the story reads to the rhythm of ""Night before Christmas"". It is a little extreme as far as red sox nation is concerned, but still delightful to read."
2,About the wig,"Well, I know it's a really cheap wig, but the big problem is that as soon I took it out of the bag, the threads started falling. It also had a lot of knots. But I only needed for one day, so it fulfilled the task."
2,Not the best,"The product was ok as a costume wig, as I only needed to wear it once. I did not like the way it was made. There was barely any hair on it, except for the very top, where most of the hair came from. I had trouble putting it on and getting it to stay in place."
1,no limits (and that is a bad thing),"I teach Software Engineering for Internet Applications. Our students are free to use whatever ACID-compliant RDBMS they prefer. Since PostgreSQL is more or less the only open-source candidate (unless you count the RDBMS open-sourced by SAP), PostgreSQL is our students' third most popular choice (after Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server). The students using this book have a horrible time picking data types because the book doesn't provide fundamental information, or at least none that we could find. Want to know how long a character string can be? How precise a timestamp is? You won't find the answers in this book."
1,Download the documentation instead,"The book is 453 pages of which 220 are simply manual pages in print. Of the other 233 pages about 105 of them are basic SQL syntax review. So now you have 128 pages left. Many of those are information about databases in general, such as what are indexes and why are they used. The amount of pure PostgreSQL specific information is very limited. The book is in no way worth.... You are basically paying for manual pages. Save your money and download the documentation for PostgreSQL which is very well written. This book is very well written and easy to follow. There is nothing techincally wrong with the book. Frequently, however, you will see the statement ""See the manual pages for more information"". Save yourself the money and see the manual pages."
2,Adequate but dry and too expensive,This book certainly covers all the basics for those wishing to learn PostgreSQL - However:1. Nearly half of the book is Appendices. Maybe OK if you don't want to read the free docs on the computer screen.2. Written like an encyclopedia. Ever try reading one of those? The lack of user exercises is particularly irritating....Get the Wrox book instead of this one and you will be richer and happier ...
2,A Limited Overview,"PostgreSQL is a complex product based on its lineage from Ingress and Illustra. Unfortunately, this book does little to draw the shrouds of mystery from the product. Half the book is devoted to the standard SQL95 commands. About a quarter of the remainder describes PostgresSQL's syntactical enhancements to that standard.The book provides almost no information about the internals of PostgresSQL. Although system tables are named at one point, there's no description at all of the data contained in these all-important tables. There's no discussion of the query optimizer, nor any meaningful discussion of PostgreSQL's locking schemes.This book is, at best, a primer. We eagerly await a book that delves beyond the surface of PostgreSQL into those features of interest to a Database Administrator."
2,Not the best collection...,"This collection of Trio songs is not the best I have heard. It fell short of my expectations, very short. I Love Trio music and I play in a traditional Trio myself, so I am very critical about what I listen to. The first thing that I noticed in this album is that the Los Tres Ases recordings are not the original lineup with Marco Antonio Muñiz. Also, Juan Neri is missing, so the requinto is a lot sloppier. Also, the Los Dandy's lineup was the older (And also much slower) group. Overall, Los Dandy's have never been that great, but Los Tres Ases, who I think are one of the top Trios, are horrible on this CD. As far as the rest goes, the choices of songs weren't the best."
4,"Great for Olympia, WA","I used this book while temporarily living in Olympia, WA, and it was a great guide to experiencing the abundance of natural beauty around the small city. Most guide books on the state of WA only cover more obvious areas like Seattle or the Olympic National Rainforest or Mount Rainier. ""Take a Walk"" is a great resource for walking trails in areas that are more off the beaten path. Also, the author provides helpful information regarding the description of the trails, difficulty level, handicap access, and directions. I can't vouch for the trails in areas outside of Olympia but, based on my experience, I would highly recommend this book as a useful, descriptive resource."
4,Good review of Parks only,"This is a great book to acclimate yourself to the numerous parks around the Puget Sound area. There are so many parks to choose from that you get a great overview of each park and what it's best uses are for. I was interested in parks to go with my toddler so I particularly wanted this book to find choices that were kid-friendly, stroller-friendly, etc. Some of the parks have very extensive trails -- this book was handy in describing the terrain and scenery with tips and maps. The maps are a great resource in this book! Just keep in mind this book isn't for those looking for a hike up in the mountains or far away from civilization. Nor is every park included!"
1,Not the same discs,"Earlier this year I purchased 100 Verbatim Data Life Plus, +R, 4.7, printable DVDs from Amazon. Every one of them burned perfectly. I was so pleased with this product that I ordered 100 more. Not a single one of these burned. That would be 100 out of 100 failures!! I am using the same equipment and using the identical process. I tried a few of my extra Ridata discs and they burned fine. I then tried some of my Verbatim +R, DL, 8.5, printable DVDs. Again, they worked. I don't know if Verbatim is using a new ink for the printable surface or if it's strictly a manufacturing dilemma. Can't just be a coincidence. I sent them back to Amazon for a refund. Picked up some Sony's locally and they, too, burned nicely."
5,Great bland dvd's!,"I have used Verbatim now for over 3 years and it's very, very rare that I have a bad one. In fact, out of the last two hundred that I have bought, I can't remember having to throw one out. With other cheaper blank dvd's that I tried in the past, this was not the case, as I made many drink coasters. Stick with Verbatim and you will be pleased."
5,I love these.,I am about 3/4 way through the spindle and have only had a couple (like 2 or something) that did not work and I love the white front. I just label them with a black permanent marker and it works great.
2,no good,"I bought this item, but amazon sent me a wrong item. the one they sent me looked exactly the same, but it was without the heating pads as shown in the picture. even the replacement was the same.so i think amazon doesnt carry this version of the slipper at all. and they are ok, not a very good quality. mine had a button to press to have a vibrating action, which was by the way does not have much massaging effect. so overall, a poorly made proiduct in my opinion. the sole is also hard and not flexible enough for walking around when you are not using the massage."
5,Amazing,"Just the experience of watching and listening to Pastor Rance Allen singing""Something About the Name Jesus""is worth the price of the whole DVD."
1,A SERIOUS waste of money,"This swing gets one star because it's easy to fold up and store. That's it. We loved it when we first got it. Then we discovered that it went through 4 D batteries EVERY WEEK. We used it anyway, and paid out our ears for batteries for a couple of months. Then, after about 2 months of use, it started slowing down. A week later it wouldn't go at all. Now it sits in our storage room while I think evil thoughts about sending it to the dump. It's a classy LOOKING swing, but a piece of crap. I'm still mad that I spent $100 on that useless thing. It's been almost a year and a half since we got it.But who knows? Maybe ours was just a faulty one. Or maybe they all just suck. Not a risk I'm ever going to take again. Seriously, don't buy it. If your experience is anything like ours, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. :)"
5,Gotta love Willie!,"If you are a true Willie Nelson fan, you will love this CD. It allows you to hear him perform popular songs with other talented artists."
3,not bad,"This isnt bad, but I heard it at the same time as Johnny Cash's last album and thought that one had more heart. I was also listening to David Allan Coe's Live From Billy Bob's and thought that one had more energy. Willie seems watered down here by all the guests."
3,"Too much ""friends,"" not enough Willie","Very few keepers on this one ... even ""Crazy"" and ""Last Thing I Needed the First Thing This Morning"" were (almost) disappointments because there was so little of Willie."
3,"It's all right, I guess","If you like live CDs, you may not be disappointed with this. I'm a big fan of WN and most of the other artists who contributed to this, but there are only 2 or 3 cuts that do it for me."
3,A tad disappointed with.....,I was a tad disappointed with this C/D by Willie and Company. He's got beeter ones out there but this isn't one of them.
2,disappointing,Pass this one by unless you are a huge fan of LIVE recordings. This is a poorly produced album in which the sound is all but lost at times due to audience noise. Being live (from the televised special which was more interesting.) you get the missed beats and strained vocals searching for that point of harmony. Its an impressive gathering of artists but its a disappointing grouping of songs and performances.
4,Good stuff,"This is just ugly stuff, and I'm addicted. Not EVERY episode is great, but the ones that are, are priceless. Overall, it's worth every penny."
3,Way too thin and smaller than I thought,"Ok, first it's my fault for not actually paying attention to the measurements, but this ""beach"" towel is extremely small. In fact, I'll probably just end up using it as a bath towel. I bought this in anticipation of my trip to Hawaii and was very disappointed when I received it. It is also extremely thin and thus, not very suitable for the beach. The slightest gust of wind blew the towel up and we ended up having to weigh the corners down with our sandals. I recommend looking elsewhere for an actual beach towel. It is nice looking and a decent multi-purpose towel, just not for the beach."
4,Marksmanship,"When i read this book I could relate to the authors mention of the relationship between the enlisted and the officer member in the USAF. I think she did a nice job b/c she did her research on the topic. I think some readers couldn't grasp that aspect of the book b/c their not in the military. I thinks some of readers felt that the author made up the end to the book. However, In the AF this type of relationship happens ALL of THE times. I like the fact that the relationship did blossom. NOT to mention the Story Hour was a nice touch."
1,"Waste of time, waste of money","Can you give no stars for a book? This book was awful... unless you're an amateur author looking for evidence that anyone (and I mean anyone!) can get published. The dialogue, the names, the plot were totally unbelievable. I never write in books, but by the time I was done, I was going through marking it up like I was in a creative workshop to make me feel as if I had accomplished at least something by reading it. Nothing about this book flowed. The only thing I liked about this book was one vague reference to JAG, my favorite TV show. Other than that, this book was a complete waste of time and money. It was full of cliches, plotholes, and bad, bad dialogue. I've read better written fanfiction."
3,Bountiful WiFi 1 Watt router,"Installation took one call to the help line as the owner's manual was not complete. Then the router would not remain stable for more than about 7 hours and was returned to the manufacturer for a RMA replacement. We are still waiting the replacement. What happened was the ethernet connections remained hard connected to the Internet but the five test wireless connections all lost their IP addresses that could only be recoverd by rebooting the router. Then about 7 hours later, this repeated. We still don't have solid performance data to present. However, we did get some testing and it looked good even if unstable."
1,Bountiful Wireless Router a BUST,"This was the second Bountiful Router I have had, both of which ""FRIED"". When it worked the range was very good but they are not very long lived, and at that price I would expect much more. I just went to a Cisco (Liksys) Router and got the same range at about 1/4 the cost, and MUCH easier to setup. I would NOT recommend this router to any one."
4,Nice story,"I think most people would be surprised that Peter Benchley wrote a novel that is really a love letter to the ocean. It is well written, has a strong interesting female lead and it is her relationship with her father that makes the story more compelling. That and a few other creatures she meets in the sea, which makes for a memorable ending.The only problem I had was with her brother, who seemed totally fixated on being as evil as possible without any compassion whatsoever. He is basically psychotic.But I did enjoy this very short novel. Definitely worth reading."
2,Illogical,"I enjoyed reading this story for the most part but, at times the calm serenity of the overview caused my bloodpressure to rise. I find that the stupidity that is shown of the the girl to her brother brought me nothing but anger. The brothers intentions were so obvious that I time and time agin found myself ranting at the girl to open her eyes and see him for what he truly was. I do understand that the point of the story was her strife but that doesn't, mean she must appear stupid."
4,The Girl of the Sea of Cortez,"Years ago my husband and I listened to this book on tape, borrowed from our local library, and enjoyed it as we traveled. In five months we will be going to the Sea of Cortez and decided to revisit the book. Our scuba-diving son from Alaska will be joining us, and I ordered a second book for him. All three of us enjoyed reading it. The basic message of caring for the environment overshadows the ending, which is a bit fantastic, but so was ""Jaws"" by the same author."
3,Disappointing treatment of a man who deserves better.,"Flatly written and repetitive, this book misses many chances to illuminate the life and work of one of the most significant public intellectuals between the 1930s and the 1980s. Jumonville keeps calling Commager a Jeffersonian liberal but seems to have no idea about the difference between Jefferson's thought and the way that thought was understood in the era of the New Deal. Also, though Jumonville stresses that Commager used history to justify political arguments, he is silent on Commager's place in the 1960s controversy about historians writing contemporary history, on which Commager wrote extensively.The sad thing is that this book is just scholarly enough to seem to occupy the field, but not scholarly enough to be the treatment that the subject deserves"
4,A good live show.,A good live show by the late Jeff Healey. He sure could sing and play guitar. We will all miss you.
5,Response to Heartland's comments,"So, Heartland, false memories and manipulation by crusading therapists are baloney? So all the incredible stories that have been claimed by the supposed victims must be true? So there must be a huge national network of Satanists sacrificing thousands of babies and leaving not a single shred of physical evidence anywhere? Wow. Thanks for your deeply thought-out insight."
1,An Unscientific Polemic,"This book is based on anecdotal evidence, and ignores completely the scientific evidence that traumatic events can be forgotten, only to be remembered years later.The author is a founding member of the ""False Memory Syndrome Foundation"". There is no scientific evidence whatsoever for ""false memory syndrome""... in fact, there is not even a scientific *definition* of this ""syndrome"".Please balance your reading with scientific literature on memory and abuse, such as those by Kenneth S. Pope or Jennifer Freyd."
3,Not Durable under Wet Conditions,"Having a flex bandage for minor cuts is a very good idea. However, these bandages do not hold up to water at all. By the second time I washed my hands the bandage would no longer stick around my finger. The sink water made the adhesive completely inert and it just would not hold. After replacing several of these Band-Aid Brand Flexible Fabric Bandages I went and got a traditional plastic adhesive bandage. These are good for skin cuts along joints where you have a lot of movement but just don't get them wet."
1,J&J Flex Fabric bandages use to be great!,"I use to buy the J&J; FF bandages in a metal box, and ran out. Bought the same titled bandages in a cardboard box last night, and what was once perfect,now do not stick. I had to get a roll of tape and tape the bandages onmy two feet. I was so disappointed as I have told so many peopleabout the wonderful bandages.What good is a bandage that does not stick?What is a Coverlet brand fabric bandage. Saw in a review thoseare better. Johnson & Johnson use to be my brand..got to checkout some other brands."
1,Quiltvent Flexible Fabric bandages,This picture misrepresents the product. The pad of the quiltvent you sent irritated my sore on my foot and I had to go to the wound clinic. Of course I quit using the quiltvent within a day. The picture on the box shown with smoothe pad of only gause is what I need.
2,Not that good if you have children in mind,Once they get wet they come off. These are not made for children. They get their hands into many things that will ruin the adhesive on these bandages. I purchased one box and still have it half full. We returned and still use regular band-aids in my house.
2,Fabric unraveling! Pad slipping out!,"I love these Flexible Fabric Bandaids. WHAT HAPPENED??The batch I got last week at the local pharmacy is falling apart!The fabric is unraveling on the ends, and it starts about an hour after you apply the bandaid.Have they started to make these overseas? Or have they changed the manufacturing site to someplace new?These have always been GREAT bandaids..but now I may have to try an off-brand or store brand to get a better quality.I also don't like the new ""pad"" that's quilted. It has some ""plasticy"" coating, and it tends to fall/slide out of the bandaid after a couple hours.Why'd they take a GREAT product like this and screw it up?I'm really ticked."
1,Worthless!!!!!!!!!!!,The Coverlet brand fabric bandages are the best you can buy. They FAR outperform the Band-Aid brand. The Coverlets have adhesive completely around the sterile pad making it possible to really protect a wound from germs. I wasted money on the Band-Aid brand as they are only good for protecting a wound from bumps; they do not completely seal the wound.
3,beats low expectations,"expectations were fairly low for this-- but it's better than expected.it's surprisingly ""adult"" --pleasant and non-threatening.If you liked the last couple Depeche Mode albums, you'll like this.If you think they're headed downhill, this won't change your mind."
2,Kind of a Drag,"Although it's better after four listens than it was after one, this one's going to need more time to grow on me. Love the voice, but I'm disappointed by the mostly weak songs. Two hummable tunes in a full-length album isn't much."
4,Smooth operator ...,"This is a great album. If you're thinking you're getting another DM album, you're wrong. Dave has his own sound, and it's beautiful."
3,A great first effort,"This is a great first effort from DM's frontman. Songs like Bottle Living and Dirty Sticky Floors show that Dave's not the only one who can rock out when he needs to (also shows the influence he had on DM's sound). While some of the songs feel a little like filler (Goodbye), it's a solid effort."
4,Better Than Recent DM,"22 years after Fashion in a Hurry hit it big with perpetual adolescents and the adults who love them, Dave Gahan releases his first proper solo CD, Paper Monsters. Not much news here to report: Gahan continues to become a better singer (his bleating days, and - hopefully - his heroin addiction, are behind him). He's written his first batch of tunes (or, at least, released them), and they're uniformly good (the ballads, especially). A lot of the tracks are about, of course, addiction and its aftermath, which limits their interest to the pop market, sure, but, smart rock star that he is, he leaves the meanings vague enough for the nonce - ""Dirty Sticky Floors"" could just as much be about the aftermath of sex as of o.d.'ing. Paper Monsters is a better album than the last three Depeche Mode releases combined, not to mention Martin Gore's solo monstrosities. In fact, Gahan could let Gore go on his merry way, but then who would wear the dresses?"
2,Paper tiger,"Its obvious that most of the reviewers on here are big fans of Depeche Mode, and they are being more than generous with their ratings. This album lacks depth and any kind of fire. I am always amazed when bands break off to do solo albums and come out with work like this - uninspired, bland. Clearly the members of Depeche Mode need the interaction with each other to come up with anything worth listening to.Do I recommend this album? No. Don't bother."
4,great item for frequent beach goers,"I gave this to my niece for Mother's day and upgraded the wheels as a gift to her husband on Father's day. It is a necessary carry all if you have a young child and lots of stuff, but the wheel conversion was an absolute must to go through the soft sand at Jax Beach. Here is the link for the conversion package: http://www.wheeleez.com/wonder-wheeler/index.php"
5,I love my Wonder Wheeler so much - I could marry it!,I just bought one for the season because I was planning on taking day trips to the shore. Boy! did this item make my life easier...you know how much stuff you end up taking to the beach and with kids in tow. This is the best invention since sliced bread! I would have paid double the price. Buy one! You will not regret it!
4,It's working great!,"We have found this beach cart to be a great help with all the ""stuff"" we like to take to the beach. Our beach has a boardwalk, also. That makes for an easy and more often trip to the beach. I did try to pull it over a sand dune and found that to be ""way more work"" than it's worth. But, for a normal beach trip it's great. It hold a lot of toys, towels and a beach bag of food. But, you have to balance to chairs on top, so very light chairs work the best. Over all, I am very pleased with cart--it fits in our jeep. Not sure how it would work in a small cars trunk. Folds fairly flat, wheels are good size. Has a pocket to hold sun screen. Would buy it again."
4,"Holds lots, wheels too narrow","The standard wheels are so narrow that moving >30 lbs (14kg) across soft sand for a long distance is an aerobic activity. Still, it holds a lot of stuff and folds down relatively small i.e. fits in my hatchback with a lot of the other beach stuff."
4,Rio Beach Wonder Wheeler Plus,"Bought the cart just prior to our annual beach trip this year. It worked out very well. We bring alot of ""stuff"" to the beach and the cart held quite a bit of it (chairs, umbrellas, cooler, towels, etc.) The wheels don't turn very well in deep sand, particularly if overloaded. We fine-tuned the ideal load as the week progressed. Folds quite compactly for travel. Overall, very satisfied with our purchase."
1,not good,"I have purchased four of these wagons over the past two or three years. two have broken the first time being used at the beach. the other two do not get used at the beach. my concern is that i gave these as gifts, and do not have the information to contact the manufacturer - i feel that Amazon shouold have some responsibility since the purchases were made from the Amazon site. Have been a steady amazon customer, but after this experience i do not know that i will place future orders."
3,Get the wider wheels!,"I have this same cart without the front wheels that I bought from a big box store. When you are carting in the sand the front wheels are usually useless anyway- it is the rear wheels that count. Invest $20 or so more and get the wider 4"" wheels!!! The wider the wheels, the easier the sand navigation. We bought the wider deluxe cart and never regretted it. We looked all over locally for the wider wheels and couldn't find it. Amazon has the best price and free shipping - you can't beat it."
5,It does the job,"Boogey boards, Beach tent, Beach Umbrella, Sand Toys, Cooler, Beach Chairs...this cart easily handles it all.Do not expect it to roll easily in the sand. You have to pull it (not push) in the sand and it takes a bit of muscle. This grandma has no problems, though and it has certainly solved the problem of not being able to take everything everybody needed to make the day at the beach a total success."
5,grest cart,"Got it to bring groceries and lots of other stuff into house from garage. I have a ramp, instead of stairs, that I can wheel the cart onto and then into house. It turns three trips into one. I recently packed ALL of my luggage and carry-ons into it, to wheel to the garage, saving many trips.I am over 65, still strong and able, but this cart saves a lot of wear and tear that I would rather use for fun stuff. I would hate to be without it.I had bought the smaller Rio cart (with back wheels only) before this one. After overloading it too often, one of the wheels broke. I was disappointed that I couldn't purchase a new wheel. I think this bigger cart will handle the weight better. If not I hope I can buy replacement parts."
5,A must when traveling with lots of beach gear,"Thank goodness I bought this in time for our last beach vacation as it was a lifesaver. We were traveling with small children and it made things so much easier to tow everything in this cart- cooler, umbrella, beach toys, beach chairs, towels etc. We've used it a few times since our vacation for local outings and so far it has held up. The wheels feel a little cheap so I was concerned they wouldn't last but so far so good. We'll see if it lasts for multiple seasons. (But even if it doesn't I think it was worth it for one summer's use)."
1,Watch out for return policy!,"When I received this product I was disappointed that it was the smaller model, which, by the way, sells for as low as $45 on other sites. I did get free shipping when I ordered this item, however, when I tried to return it, their policy is to deduct the original shipping charge plus a 15% restocking fee from your refund. Therefore, my refund would only be $38, plus I had to pay to ship the item back! I decided to give the cart to a family member and buy the larger model when we got to the beach. Will never order from this vendor again."
2,Don't waste your money.,"I've seen this cart used on the beach and thought it was a great idea. But it is overpriced, flimsy and breaks easily. Both front wheels broke when assembling, following the directions. The attachments are poorly made. One of the back wheels kept slipping from the locked position to unlocked, making the structure flimsy. But it was still usable without the front wheels as it can't roll away and it folds easily. If it was better made I would recommend it, as it could be very helpful. As it is now, don't waste your money for a one time use."
1,Wheels hollow and broke after a few uses!,"The first few times i used this it was awesome but after the 3-4 time the wheel simply split in half right at the seem! This was not overloaded by any means...upon examination i realized the rear wheels are super cheaply made, hollow and thin plastic with a seem right down the middle. I have had this in my basement ever since (over a year now) in hopes that i can buy better replacement wheels (maybe solid rubber or something)..other than that it's a great cart."
1,Broke before I could even get it put together,Directions were vague but I did my best to follow them carefully. When installing the front small wheels a plastic tab broke off as I tried to push the wheels on. This happened on both front wheels. Now wheels won't stay on. Cheap plastic and poor directions = returning and will keep looking for something better.
3,Meh. Better than dragging everything by hand... I suppose.,"This arrived today and we immediately packed up and headed to the river. It was just my son and me, so we didn't have a ton of stuff - a medium size cooler, umbrella, one chair, folded up rubber raft, and a beach bag. The cart was FULL. Probably could've handled a couple more chairs, but that's about it.The trek through the sand was tough. Better than taking multiple trips (for sure!), but the wheels really dragged through the sand. I'd read in previous reviews how some people upgraded their wheels, and the second I'm done writing this I'll be doing the same thing. The cart handled well enough, but I'm worried about the mesh bag (tearing), and overall the cart felt a little... unstable?Overall it was better than dragging our stuff across the sand, but it was still a haul and I'm just not sure how well this will hold up - especially for the price."
2,"The ""Big Book"" is outdated","This book is difficult to read and comprehend as it was wriiten some 50 years ago using old arcahic english...It has helped some people stay sober though...Thats why I gave it two stars, but it is hard to read and didn't hold my interst very well."
1,its pulp,"the big book is one of the most obtuse, poorly written and edited books ever assembled. This is a book designed to do nothing more than glamorize AA and the faith healing based Program it created. it is of absolutley no value to anyone who is interested in sobriety who is not in aa, or anyone who is still capable of critical thinking. the author of this review is a ex-aa drone, and is a fully recovered alcoholic. 4 years sober. 3 years out of that perpetual sicknesss cult."
5,BUY IT!!!,this game is very fun! you have to race to unlock cars and get money. this is very fun and i recommend it for all ages!
2,Difficult to control,"The graphics in this game are fine... pretty advanced for a handheld. The cars look great, the tracks are interesting. I don't love the controls though, I find it difficult to really get the car moving around corners... the placement of the controls makes it difficult to move back and forth between the brakes & gas, and some of the camera movement is disorienting, confusing, and makes it difficult to tell when obsticles are coming up. I'm constantly nailing other cars, and have difficulty moving up through the ranks. I normally LOVE racing games, and I'm normally pretty good at them. This game is difficult, though... Not fun difficult. Irritating difficult.I would not buy this game again, I'm sure there will be much better racing games available in the near future."
4,,Great game it includes all those cars for racing and even some unlockables i personally think it better then most of the racing games introduced to the ds yet. So many cars and tracks and the graphics arent too shabby either. go ahead give it a try.
4,pretty good,"this game for me was extremely easy at the beginning but got harder as the cars got faster. The graphics rule and the cars are cool. Cop chase is extremely fun. It is cool how u can upgrade your cars and make then turn sharper, go faster, change color, and change the body style of it. These features kick booty. One thing i hate is when u hit cars from the back u slow down alot and they shoot forward, and when u hit a car that is sitting still the car doesnt flip away it just sits there like a wall and stop and u have to reverse and drive away. This causes the other racers to fly past u as u just sit there. But luckily sometimes they wreck also and u can go past them. the game is 5/5 for fun but 4/5 overall because of hard difficulty and bad wrecks."
3,Angels in cross-stitch,"Colorful book with good instructions, however I found the designs to be a little simplistic for an experienced stitcher. I usually prefer more realistic designs. The book did have a good variety of designs and was well worth the money."
5,excellent quality,"Great quality. It was actually a bright white, not a yellowish white. Packaging came a bit torn, but did not affect the cardstock inside."
2,I got what I paid for...,"I bought this paper to make wedding fans. I was disappointed in the thickness of the paper. I ordered 90lb cardstock for our invitations which was a different brand and it was thicker than this 110lb cardstock. The paper is definately thicker than regular cardstock, but I was expecting more. If I use this paper I will definately have to use two layers. It is certainly thick enough for cards, invitations and for uses other than a paper fan. Just thought I would write the review so you know what to expect."
2,3D Dud,95% of this movie is not in 3d. The opening scenes and ending are in 3d and well done. Not one of Imax's better efforts. A real disappointment both technically and content wise.
2,3D? What?,I still could not understand how this movie qualified as full-fledged 3D movie. It was just slapped together for reasons other than for the purpose of educating viewers. I expected to see the rituals observed during the time when millions of the Islamic faith gather at their holy site(s) and all in 3D. The author might have used one of these off-Best Buy 3D Sony camcorders to insert snippets of 3D tracks. I felt ripped off and that is considered a sin by that very faith also.
1,steve,PR for Saudi Arabia. Little coverage of Madain Sahla. A lot of propaganda and false history. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,Disappointing,The 2d version is as good as the 3d version. The 3d version looks like a greeting card display of standup scenes.
3,"Good, not great","I bought this after loving Peter in Blueberry Forest. This book isn't as good of a story. It doesn't ""flow"" well and I get bored reading it. My son likes it ok- he was 2.5 when I bought it. I really don't like the fairy calls an elf ""stupid."" My son picked up on that and now calls me and everyone else stupid. I prefer her other books."
5,Great find!,These reeds are fantastic! So glad to have found them! A friend saw an ad in a magazine and I was glad to find them online.
4,Does the job,"this reed works for marchingband. it is weather, shock and time resistant. i do not recommend for ensemble use, use this reed for outside or marching band, i think thats what it was meant for."
1,garbage,Bought this and took it back almost immediately. Found that my right hand kept scraping against one of the corner edges that formed the opening for the jack on that side. My PSP didn't fit very snugly inside either.
1,could be better,its alittle clunky and cumbersome when trying to play games. does double as a stand for watching movies that is very helpfull on long haul trips and such. but when it came down to it i ended up taking my psp out of this case in order to play it properly. with this case you also have to carry a seperate case for the umds since there isnt anywhere to store them in this one. but it does make a good weapon when fighting over turns on the psp since its rather heavy and could easily break a nose or black an eye if tossed alittle harder than percieved. all in all i found it to be more of a glorifed paperweight that can hold a psp since i have since went back to the cheap pelican case that is lightweight and holds 4 umds (5 if you leave one in the psp).
1,unsatisfactory,i purchased two of these items for me sons psp's so thet sont brake them and only one was sent i would never recoment this item!
5,This should've come standard with every PSP.,"This is the only accessory my PSP 2000 ever needed. It looks sleek, doubles as a hands-free stand, and has protected my PSP from several falls including one from a truck. It only has one flaw - you can't see the battery LED when it's closed, so when charging you may have to leave it open (or this may not bother you). I only hope there's a similar case for Vita!"
2,not really for the psp2k,"i just bought a piano black psp2k (mostly for movies while travelling) and thought this case would offer good protection while in my bag, which it does. the reason that i gave it 2 stars is that one of the best features for my intended purpose was the 270 degree hinge to make a stand while watching movies. unfortunately the psp2k headphone jack is in a place that's covered (just barely) so there's no way to use this a stand and have your headphones plugged in. the wireless on/off is also covered so that's useless as well.i think it should be noted in the product description that this item doesn't work well (other than protection) for the psp2k. unfortunate."
4,Not for PSP Slim & Light (PSP-2000),"The ordering process and delivery was as smooth as possible (thanks, Amazon.com), but this product is not designed for the new PSP Slim & Light (PSP-2000), which is what I have. I wish the product description made that clear. The new PSP sits loose in the case, and the earphone socket is covered by the case while the unit is inside the case. Luckily, Amazon.com took it back, no hassle, and even paid for the return shipping. Can't beat the service.I had to rate it in order to leave this review, so I'm giving it four stars. It looks like a superbly made and sturdy product, and enough people seem to be happy with it."
1,NOT MADE FOR NEW MODELS,This case will not allow the earphone to be plugged in when using the NEW models. (Silver and Star Wars)
3,NOT FOR PSP SLIM! BUT>........,"This case is NOT for the psp slim... But for anyone that is going to or already has the case, you can make adjustments for it psp to fit. When I gotthe case I thought that the thing would never fit...But I was wrong, If you put some Styrofoam at the bottom of the case, that way the psp will be lifted so it won't jiggle around so much. Next I used my drill on the side so the ear buds would fit in the hole.Another thing I hate is the edge on the left side, so I sanded it down.It's to big too, but it makes you feel like you have something(for only psp slims).If you have it and want to send it back, it costs more for for shipping then what you payed for.I only rate this item for 3 stars because it would be great with the core.IF YOU HAVE A SLIM, DO NOT GET THIS ITEM!"
5,Best case for a handheld!,"This is one of the best cases for the psp out there, it does what it does, PROTECTS YOUR PSP! It is virtually indestructible and its small and fits your psp perfectly, so its not like the GBA cases that you use to save games and everything, nono waste of space, this case is the best case out there, GET IT if you have a psp and you dont want it to get scratched"
3,Not as I expected,"It is a hard pocket wich turns out to be very safe for your PSP. Even though to lock it, sometimes you have to take care with the adjustment of both parts. If you push forward even softly the upper part, for example, you may not lock it so easily. Overall, it is a cheap, good looking and safe pocket to travel with."
3,Only one MAJOR setback,The only set back is that the psp DOES not securely lock into this case. It would have been much better if they created a way for the psp to stay put. If you open the case too fast or hold it at a certain angle the psp will DROP OUT.Other than that it is a good case because you can play the psp while in the case. (even though it adds another pund to the system) `IT is defineately NOT worth 19 dollars in the store. It looks very sleek and cool. It is a GOOD product.
3,Okay but not the protection needed,"the protection is amazing when its closed and your not playing, but the problem is the majority of the time i drop it, is when i am playing it. the pgp makes it uncomfortable to play your psp with, and if you did manage to drop your psp, it would fall right out; making the pgp useless to play with. so if you want protection for when u are playing, get a different product."
5,Quite good,I really like this case it is not very good for protectin gyour psp wail you are gaming but otherwise i really like this case it is very hard but it does get scratched up
4,"For your PSP storage only, could also be customized!!!","You can play your PSP when it is in the case but is not as good as other full protector cases that are in the market. That's because when playing your PSP the PSP is exposed and if it falls while playing it there is no way to sve it from scratches or even get broken. That's the total true about this case. But in the other hand if all you want if leave your PSP inside the case just for storage and keep it safe, then this is the case you will rally need. Why? Because it is a very strong material, you can customize how it looks by adding any picture you desire to make it look attractive, and because you can use it for those days when you travel and just wanna play some music while leaving the PSP inside the case fully protected from scratches and system injuries. Highly recommend this one for storage only!!!"
4,Indestructible!,"This case is the smartest thing I have bought for my psp. The case is very durable and easy to use, you just set it in there. The things I don't like about it is that you have to take the psp out to change the game, if the case is open the psp will fall out easily (say, if you drop it), and it's kinda bulky. Really though, these are minor drawbacks to protecting you $200+ investment."
4,Does its work.,"if you love your Psp this is the protection you need. You coud use your PSP in it with is great, but beware because when its open, only gravity keeps them together."
4,Logitech PSP Playgear Pocket,"This item truly is armor for your PSP. Once inside this, i'm not sure if anything could damage the PSP. This is good for those people who keep their psp in a backpack with other things. It is pretty bulky so i wouldn't recommend keeping it in your pocket. This is a must buy!steven"
4,An absolute necessity for the PSP,"Unlike the Nintendo DS, designed with its own cover, the PSP has NO protection whatsoever. It is a fairly fragile system at risk for damage or breakage if dropped. The Logitech Playgear Pocket is a great solution to this problem. For the price, it brings peace of mind and serves as a storage case, a frame that allows films to be viewed 'hands free' and it does not interfere with gameplay or recharging the system.It is fairly heavy, but that may be inevitable as it has a decent lining that cushions the system in the event of being dropped. There is no extra storage space for games, but the decision not to include extra space may have been an effort to limit its total size and weight. I highly recommend this to any one with a PSP."
5,great case,"I bought this case to protect my PSP. And it does the job very well. Full all around protection, easy accessability, and customizable. If you've got a PSP please get this case, you wont regret it and neither will your PSP."
3,This case does not fit the PSP 2000 (Slim),"This is a great case for the original PSP console only. If you use it with the PSP 2000, the audio jack is blocked, and the fit is loose."
1,Not compatible with psp 2000,The openings do not allow access to the headphone jack. Meaning if you wanted to use headphones with this case you would have to take the psp out. Kinda defeats the purpose. Also the switch for wifi in the psp 2000 is on top and there is no access hole for that either. Functional only for old psp edition.
5,Sweet!,This thing rules!!! It really protects ur PSP. I accidentally dropped my PSP down the stairs and the PlayGear Pocket kept it nice and safe :)
3,Not quite what i expected.,"it's fine. it protects your psp. i don't really regret buying it. that said, it's very bulky & the psp doesn't fit perfectly in it, it's kinda too big. the psp moves around a little in it, and it's annoying if you wanna plug in the charger while the psp is in it, cause of the excess space. you basically have to plug the charger in before puttin the psp in its case."
5,"GREAT product, value","I can't say enough about how much I value this case. I commute each day to/from work by train, and my PSP (along with my iPod) are necessities for survival. As fellow PSP owners know, the unit itself is fairly fragile, so tossing it into my bag without this case would be suicide. In the case, however, I don't need to give it a second thought.The only downside is that there is no ""cutout"" for headphones, but I remedied that small issue by making my own using a power drill. Not the most attractive, but it did the trick!HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Anyone who gives a PSP as a gift, spend the extra $15 and get this case too. Protect the investment!"
4,Great case,"Great case, great price. Could only be improved by addition of space for a few games/movies/sticks."
5,Neat PSP case.,"(Note to editor, the ranking system thinks this is a game!)I rate it 5 star otherwise.Already saved my psp from major scratches and nicks. Glad I bought it.If you like to travel with your psp but like to keep it in mint condition this product is a must. I've thought about a screen protector, but hate to have anything to degrade the *nice* psp screen during play.The foam/rubber interior seems to keep it safe from mishandling too. I think it's worth the extra bulk."
1,Not for psp1000,"This item says it is for the psp 1000. It is NOT. My PSP barely fit in the case, and then it would not close. This is NOT FOR PSP1000."
4,Very Strong - Great protection for PSP,"I got this case with my PSP and love it.The Ups:First of all, you can play the PSP while it's in the case. Second, you can use the case as a stand to watch movies. And third, you can still charge the PSP or listen to music while it is in the case.The Downs:The downside to this product is the fact that the case itself scratches fairly easy and there is no extra room to hold other games or movies.Even with the downfalls, I highly recommend this case!"
3,"It holds a PSP, but as far as any other claim. . .","I got this in the mail and was rather surprised with how cheap and flimsy it was. The lid does not stay in any position except latched closed. The rubber pads do hold the PSP in place and it closes tight enough that nothing rattles, but gives the feeling that any drop would just send the PSP shooting right out. It cannot stand on its own like shown, which is very disappointing. For a case to keep it from scratches and minor dents and dings (maybe in a backpack) it meets its the mark, but for any other features, this is not it."
4,PSP Protective Case,"This is perfect for putting your PSP in and then tossing it in your bag. However, unlike the Otter Box for the iPod, this does not protect against shock or water. Also, the PSP slim has a little jiggle room in the case so be careful, perhaps add something else for more padding.The downside is that you can't use the device while it's inside, even if the lid is open. The charger jack is available, but the headphone/audio output jack is not. All in all, it's worth getting if you want something to hold your PSP while you're traveling about town.The other protective (and perhaps more important) gear to get is the screen shield which protects against scratches."
4,good for the price,"this is a nice case but it is sort of bulky. theres not much to it, its just clear polycarbonate and black rubber underneath, the picture is misleading as it looks like it is solid black polycarbonate."
5,The Genuine Article,"This is it, folks, the standard by which all WWII aviation flicks must be measured. A documentary, yes, but brilliant and riveting. Only ""12 O'Clock High"" comes close to the artistry of this movie. By contrast, the modern-day, Hollywood-ized ""Memphis Belle"" makes me retch. A must-see for any aviation buff!!! Also, Bob Morgan's book, ""The Man Who Flew The Memphis Belle"" is a good complement to this film."
3,"Wellesz, symphonies 1 and 8","Wonderful! If you like ""difficult"" music like Schönberg or Berg you'll be satisfied. Beautiful music, deep sound. Good and effective orchestra.Martin - Canada"
2,"REPETITION, REPETITION, REPETITION... 4 OUT OF 10","I am appalled at the fact that this game is so repetitive and developers can't seem to make a good Godzilla game(I've seen the reviews). Seriously, is it really that difficult? This game is incredibly boring and repetitive and is not fun. All you do is direct Godzilla where to go, and during that process he destroys the same buildings over and over again relentlessly with no purpose in doing so. He may destroy a tank or fight a boss here or there but it is incredibly boring, and I really don't see how these other amateur critics gave this game four stars! Avoid this game people, it's too repetitive and boring for anyone except idiots. So just wait for the day a good Godzilla game comes out because this one is just bad."
3,A review by a Banking Software Developer,The book on the whole is good. It is very general and useful for novice and little experienced people.I would like to see more enhancements to this book. e.g Details of Collateral Management systems etc.I will keep it short and will write a detailed review later
2,dissatisfied,"I thought it was going to be a really easy to use appliance based on the 2 glowing reviews above. However, I had a hard time with it staying balanced on top of my bath tub, while adding in wet clothes. It was frustrating. In the end, I just put it on the foot of the bath tub or the floor."
5,This product WORKS,"This product WORKS - designed well, light but very sturdy - can be used in many ways."
2,Formula must have changed,"I've used this product off and on (when the need arose) for several years now and I used to swear by it, but this time something was definitely different. For one thing, it was much more watery, with significantly less of the concentrate at the bottom, and for another, the color was a much streakier orangey hue than the pink it used to be. Don't know if the manufacturer is trying to cut corners by offering up a sub-par, cheaper formula or if I just got a bad batch, but I was deeply disappointed. The new product doesn't really work, either, whereas before it was effective almost immediately.Why mess with a dependably successful formula? At the very least tell people what you've done; it just seems foolishly short-sighted to save money in the short-term by making an inferior product, when all it does is ensure you're going to lose your customer base for the future."
3,It just wasn't for my skin type,"I wanted to like it, I really did. It's not that it doesn't do what's advertized, but everyone's skin is different and it just wasn't for me."
2,Works fine. But it's TINY!,"Does the job -- this is pretty simple, after all. But the stamp is so very tiny that it's hard to legibly ""dot"" in the chords, and hard to read them once you've done so. Final verdict: if you're over 30, this is probably too small for you to see; buy a bigger one."
2,Not functional,The little shelf won't shut all the way and is crooked. The Envelope holder ends are short and not tall enough. The bottom one can't even keep little No. 10 envelopes from falling out of it. Boo.
5,WANTED!!!!,"This is my favorite book of all time and I have read it in German and Slovenian several times. I have been looking for a copy of the English version for years but have not been able to find it. The title is ""It can't always be caviar.""[...]"
4,Paul Sheriffs visual basic,"Like everybody else, I have purchased many Visual Basic books and have found that Paul Sheriffs books relate to the database manipulation(business world) better than most other authors. I like his style of coding and his heavy use of resuable code procedures and functions. Note: I purchased the book as a reference to his videos. The book says exactly the same thing as his videos(purchased these also). I did although have a tough time getting an adequate response from him with errors in his book. If he comes out with future books related to the web and or oops, I will probably be in line to buy a copy."
4,Best VB6 book for beginners,"This is THE BEST BOOK on Visual Basic 6 for Beginners. Sadly,its proofreading is miserably shabby. A great deal of typo mistakes - trivial but annoying - seems to devaluate the quality of the book (pp 140 & 317 etc..). Still, it is the best one for beginners."
4,Excellent in content and style,This book intended for beginners is one of the best books i have read. It's content and style are easy to comprehend. But the minus point is that it has gone thru pretty bad proof reading. There are typos in variable names which makes it annoying and confusing sometimes. But it makes an excellent impact on VB's image as an easy GUI program. Kudos to Paul sheriff and his team.
5,Buy It!,This is definitely a book that would appeal to the rank beginner. Other Visual Basic books throw you to the lions in terms of information overload. Sheriff's instruction style is gradual and paced. The book also has a very low price compared to other similar works. They don't get any better than this.
4,moon and stars,"These are great, the only problem is that you need to get your own glue or sticky tape to put them up with. The tacky stuff that comes with this does not last and you will be picking up stars all over the room the next morning. I can say this because it happened to me! lol but over all worth the money and the kids think they are camping at night! it is great!"
3,Glow in the dark Crescent Moon and Stars,Only glow for about 10 minutes. The sticky tapes don't stay on the wall and ceiling. Stars are very small.
5,A very authentic representation of Abruzzo regional cooking!!,This book is well written and deserves high praises for its aunthenticity. The recipes are very much the same as I remember them from my Mother's and Grandmother's cooking. Many of the recipes are almost exact duplicates. I come from a family that emigrated from Abruzzo. We were all born there and practiced many of the same recipes. One must keep in mind when reading the recipes that each small town in the region had its own cuisine and food traditions. The auther has done a fine job depicting many of these differences within the region. I was so much impressed with the contents of this cookbook that I decided to purchase additional (4) copies for my children and family.
3,Not Quite,"This is not a compilation of authentic native recipes. In fact, it is more a mini-memoir of the author's childhood. For authenticity, see Italian Regional Cooking by Ada Boni."
2,Amazing One-Dimensional,"One word best describes this album: excess.Another word would be: monotonous.Put these two words together and you have one of Steve Howe's most boring solo efforts. Which is too bad, really, because there is such promise in the premise.Basically this album tends to be explorations on only a couple sets of music ideas: rock and roll. Steve sets up a simple rhythmic foundation (kept in strict metronomic fashion by his son, Dylan, who knows not how to play drums with any style or substance), and then proceeds to noodle around with solos.It's rather like the most boring jazz. There is little structure and arranging here.I think the reason why this was such a let-down is because TURBULENCE, his previous all-instrumental album, was such a masterpiece. I expected more of the same.What I got was triteness disguised as musicianship, all wrapped up in one of the worst album covers imaginable."
4,Perfect table for a toddler,"I love thew look of this farmhouse table and couldn't wait for my 18mo old gtrandson to have it.Shipping was timely, packaging fine and instructions ok too.My only issue with the set at all is thatr I wish the table top finish was a little more durable.Trying to contact the manufacture about what to put on it has proved difficult.Knowing toddlers, there will be some crayon and marker that doesn't quite make the paper and clean up is not going to be as easy as it could be with a little better finish.Outside of that, I love the set and more important, so does my Grandson and his Mother!!"
5,Love this table!,"I bought this table for my granson's 2nd birthday and he absolutely loves it! Wants to eat every meal at this table, colors, finger paints, etc. Set is strong enough for adults to join him by using the other chair. Well made. Would definately recommend!"
2,Where are John Leguizamo's songs?,"Sure, the CD is a nice enough collection of excellent classic rock tunes. But I came here to get the versions, I heard on the DVD. There, actor John Leguizamo was singing ""My Kinda Lover"", ""The Breakup Song (They Don't Write `Em)"" plus ""Shakin'"" by Eddie Money. He did a pretty good job. So I have no idea, why these recordings are not included on the soundtrack album. Instead we get the original versions, most fans of this kind of music already own. Hmm...Also, actor Donal Logue performed (and wrote!) a short little acoustic song for the movie, which, despite being a very close cousin of The Beatles' ""Hey Jude"", I would have liked finding it here. But again, no such luck!"
2,Disappointed,"Having just watched the movie on DVD, and being pleasantly surprised by John Leguizamo's versions of The Breakup Song, Shakin', and My Kinda Lover, I was hoping that I'd find his renditions of these tunes on the soundtrack album. Instead, what I find are just the songs as performed by the original artists, which I could find in any number of places! And why replace Shakin' with that bonus track that wasn't even in the movie?"
5,Outstanding Soundtrack Complements Outstanding Film,"You'd probably like the soundtrack even if you didn't see the film...but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you DON'T see it. Watching the film, my impression is that the music choices were quite careful, ""conscious,"" that no one song has been ""thrown in there"" for the sake of having background noise. I think that kind of awareness is impressive given that it's fairly rare!Again, the soundtrack itself is still WELL worth listening to. There are sentimental melodies/ballads, some familiar classic rock, new band(s) & a great original. I just wish that they'd included some of the other originals that were written for & performed in the film. Just another reason to go see it: more great music. Watch Jay Mohr driving along, hurting, singing along while ""Only the Lonely"" plays on the radio & that song will get to you like never before.It's a 5 star soundtrack & most enjoyable, perhaps, when witnessing the 5 star performances."
3,CD buy,The product was fine. The delivery was right on schdule. Not much to say. They want me to write more. Look even if the cd was junk it doesn't matter the price was great. I don't have any complaints or words of wisdom.
4,"Great record of the ""rock"" Isley's","Super cd of the Isley's in their ""rock"" era. Ernie Isley's guitar playing is super."
3,Before the Explosion,"Recorded at New York's infamous Bottom Line in 1972, THE ISLEYS LIVE serves as the last album released before the official announcement of the 3+3 lineup. The material is derived from the albums ""Givin' It Back"" (1971) and ""Brother Brother Brother"" (1972), and of course a hornless ""It's Your Thing"" is included (a version with horns appears as one the bonus cuts recorded live at Yankee Stadium in 1969). On this album, Ernie, Marvin and Chris display their ample talents although Ernie comes off as too loud and show-offy on the draggy ""It's Too Late"" and funeral-like ""Ohio/Machine Gun"". The recording quality is thin but adequate, and the lounge lizard techniques (i.e. Ronald impersonating Ray Charles and The Supremes At The Copa-like spoken intoduction to ""Love The One You're With"")wear a little thin. Overall, an imperfect but good document of the Isleys in concert before the gold and platinum album avalance that occured during the rest of the 1970s."
3,Not what I thought it was,"After Playing this game, I was interested in getting some of 16 Volt's music from the game. I bought this CD after running a search for 16 Volt on Amazon. This was the only Primal related CD that came up in the search so I bought it. There is not one single song by 16 Volt on this CD, it is a musical score. It's nice, it's just not what I was after."
5,Anachronistic Delight,"This album contains music that Sir Thomas Beecham arranged for ballet use. And when Sir Thomas arranged, did he arrange. Baroque purists steeped in historically informed performance theory will gag, but there's no denying that this is beautiful music delightfully played. By turns delicate and vigorous, these renditions fall into that corral that holds, among others, Respighi's Ancient Airs and Dances and the Old English Suite of Granville Bantock. They appear also to be available in a newer addition along with Beecham's reworking of Handel's Solomon, so if you want more of the conductor's treatment of that Baroque composer's music, I suppose you could opt for that release instead of this one. In any case, forget about historicity and just enjoy the wonderful sounds."
3,amazon unleashed,"I listened to this album and think it is a good effort and partially concur that although it is reminiscent of the shimmer of Al Green,it packs no where near the emotion and punch of the great rev.Green.More importantly,I would love to understand how on earth Amazon groups this album with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club,The Shins and Sun Kil Moon.The only similarities I can discern is that all of them released CDs."
3,Seriously flawed,"The Soul of John Black has one undeniable flaw.....The Soul of John Black has one undeniable flaw.....The Soul of John Black has one undeniable flaw.....The Soul of John Black has one undeniable flaw.....The Soul of John Black has one undeniable flaw.....The Soul of John Black has one undeniable flaw...Beyond that, the beats are superb."
5,The Unusuals,"This series was such a breath of fresh air. But however creatively it contributed to TV crime shows, the network pulled it. Castle is a faint second in wit and personal creativity. ABC isn't the only TV network with coal up their backsides. NBC and CBS need seeing eye dogs to find their way home. Its all about sponsor sales and that's all about short term viewer numbers. In the old days the networks gave a show several years to find their audience. They didn't care about commercialism as much as they do today. I enjoyed seeing The Unusuals again on DVD. I only wish a network would come along to resurrect the cast, writers and staff and do another five seasons."
3,Just wanted to try another Jeremy Renner movie,"I found this series very good, drama and a lot of humor. I can see why it was cancelled but I did enjoy the characters in this series but what I did see was enough."
4,Had potential,"An interesting show. But for 10 episodes on one disc -- that means heavy compression -- at $29 list it is too expensive. [Commenter Blue Coronet points out that the amazon.com listing is wrong. It is not a double-sided single disc, there are two DVDs in the set. This however does not change my opinion. Five episodes per disc is not an optimum video bitrate. Let's face it. They were too cheap to put the series on three DVDs.]Maybe some of the characters were a little too kooky just for the sake of kookiness. Maybe if it had continued, it might have spun out of control, jumped the shark rather early. However, it is nice to see a cop show that isn't as formulaic as most. It had potential.Definitely worth a rental, though, if you like offbeat drama-comedy."
4,I like the characters,"This show is ok I guess. I like the characters. I like ""42"". But I don't see myself buying the DVD for just 10 episodes. FOX is having The Good Guys on Monday. It is so fun to watch. I highly recommend it if you want to watch a *different* kind of cops show like The Unusuals."
3,Poorly written/ Well acted drama,Found the Unusuals highly unbelievable as it all happened too smoothly and no one got hurt. Not a real life police episode but more a soap opera being carried out by some fine acting. Recommend this to thos who enjoy the happy beginning to ending where nothing worse than a few pranks occur.
5,The Unusuals--Fun Show,"I loved the show. The Unusuals provided a nice balance between story and character development. Checking Amazon nearly daily for the DVD.ABC execs are idiots. I think they expect every new show to be an instant hit. The Unusuals was the type of show that takes a season or two to develop a following, but the following would have been passionately loyal if given the chance."
5,Not Fair !,"Why did they cancel this show? Every time I find a great show to watch, it gets cancelled ! I really enjoyed the way everything in this show was just a little bit off. It is very much worth watching over many times! I recommend it to everyone, especially the harshess critic of television that I know, my brother!"
5,"awesome, just awesome","I guess network tv wasnt quite ready for this awesome show. Great actors , sometimes over the top acting, but a perfect bit of over the top. Wacky stories , that were fun to watch. And the characters were great. Too bad ABC cancelled yet another cool show. The dvd which is exclusive to Amazon, is very cool and a added bit to my dvd collection. I highly recommend picking up this collection of highly entertaining episodes for yourselves."
4,I Really Liked This Series,"Ireally liked this show. It had all the odd ball-off the wall characters a series of this genre needs to entertain it's audience. Once again I feel the decision makers, the ones who determine the longevity of a series were way premature in pulling this one off the air but then again they seem to do this all the time to programs I like."
4,Unusuals quite unusual,"I watched this program on TV in Australia before I bought the DVD. It just caught my fancy for some reason. It's a little out of the ordinary for a 'cop' show, but quite enjoyable. Shame the powers that be didn't give it more of a chance to take off. The storylines were somewhat different and the characters were certainly 'different'. All in all, an enjoyable experience."
2,Not Dumb Enough,"I am a true beginner regarding Photoshop. I was told I could edit my digital photos by using this program and that I could be helped in the process by reading this book. I thought I would get an explanation as to what the artistic possibilites were and how the techniques could be executed via the computer. I am on p. 127 and not able as yet to use much of the information to edit a picture. The author informs about what buttons to click regarding a certain aspect of the program, but he does not offer useful information as to how you can practically use a technique. For instance, I still do not know how to use the color palette even though McClelland explains to you about how to access it. The author also assume a level of computer vocabulary/knowledge. I am a real dummy regarding computers so the explanations are not helpful. The jokes are annoying. I am very frustrated and disappointed by this book."
2,Not So Great,"This book has some good basics in it, but they are not well illustrated or explained . Much time is spent showing how you can alter images with odd colors or other relatively useless things. The practical information here could have been said in one-quarter the pages. Most of us want to use this ap to make our basic pictures better and to retouch old family photos. You have to dig pretty hard to find that information.The jokes and smart remarks are not very funny, and you get tired of wading through them to find what you are after. After 20 pages of this, you want the authors to just get to the point."
1,Not so hot!!!,"Very disapointed in this book; nowhere up to the other ""For Dummies"" volumns I've purchased. As a ""how to"" instructional volumn I found it very lacking in clarity and comtinuity as a step-by-step manual."
3,Photoshop Elements 2 Joke Book,While I found a lot of help from reading the book it was not worth wading through the author's feeble attempt to be a comedian. If I want to read comedy I will buy a joke book.I would certainly not recommend this book.
2,Incomplete,"I love the Dummies books for beginning to learn new stuff but this one is not all there! It contually refers the reader to the ""Cheat Sheet"" in the front and to the ""Color Plates"" to view the results of the action just described but they're NOT there! It's not possible to understand without the visual presentation. I'm very disappointed."
2,photoshop elements 2 for dummies,I could not find anywhere in the book any good descriptions on using the tools. There is no reference at all to the clone stamp tool. I wanted help with this tool and there were no instructions.
4,Very nice,These socks are exactly what I wanted and what I expected. Spending more for a good pair of socks is worth the money. My only problem is washing the socks. I washed the socks with my dark clothing and the socks picked up all the lint there was from the load of dark clothing now I have hours ahead of me picking the lint off. The next pair goes in with the polyesters.
3,sagging socks,"I loved these socks when I first got them, but after a few washings, they drive me nuts by constantly falling down my legs. And my legs are far from being skinny. Still, if you can't afford to pay more and you just want socks to keep your feet and legs warm on winter nights, they will do that."
5,Nice and Warm,I honestly only ordered these because I wanted free shipping and who doesn't need socks. I took them camping and they kept my feet/legs super warm!
4,"This is a size 7-9, so not for little feet","Got these for my wife, nothing said the size... my bad. She's a 6, these are too big for her. Well built though, and I love the last dozen or so pair of Gold Toe black knee socks I've gotten for her. Look good, wears a long time, and hold their elasticity."
1,Awful! They don't stay up!,I am always on the lookout for solid colored knee-high socks. I wore these once and they didn't even stay up during that time! Don't buy.
3,"Good for beginners, experienced can look elsewhere","I got this book with an intention of digging a little deep into C#, alas I was disappointed. The book is good for people who are new to the .NET environment and C# language. However if you are experienced in C# and looking for a more comprehensive book, don't think of spending time and money for this book."
3,A bit disappointed after ASP.Net Unleashed...,"I have ASP.Net Unleashed and think it is a great book. Unfortunately, ASP.Net Unleashed is all VB.Net code. I bought C# Unleashed hoping that it would help to fill in where ASP.Net was C# bare.I've found C# Unleashed to be a bit too superficial. It covers a wide variety of topics, but doesn't go into enough detail. I like how ASP.Net gives you all the details without Visual Studio.Net wizards. C# Unleashed seems to run the wizard, copy the code into the book, and then explain a little bit about each line.I'd like to see some more complete examples for some more advanced topics, and more detail about what the code is actually doing. I often find myself doing the examples and then having lots of questions about how to properly extend them.Also, if you are looking for a reference book, this isn't it. Often classes have one simple example and more information about the class isn't available. I've found MSDN to be much more helpful."
2,"Well organized, but very boring !","This book covers pretty much all the topics for a beginner. But its just too boring. If your a beginner and you want a good refrence handy when ever you get stuck, this is the book to buy.If you want an intresting book to learn C# I recommend some other book."
5,"Clear, Concise and Practical","C# Unleashed is an excellent book for someone who already knowsa programming language and wants a quick yet solid introduction to C#. The chapters are well structured and chock full of examples. Instead of the usual foobar type of examples the examples are clear and some of them may be used directly in ones own code. Each of the examples are well described in the text so that one can focus on a problem without having to read the whole chapter.The book can also be used as a practical reference. ""Tough"" topics like Remoting, Network libraries etc. are also covered.The text is well written and easy to read. Some Text Books are boring but this is not one of them.The chapter on Interfaces as an example, is one of the best I have read....I look forward to more of his books."
2,Could have been a good intermediate book,"hello again.Its me .net learner.I hav thoroughly covered throught the examples after starting onalot of beginner wrox books. This must be book number 9 forme in the ,net series.This books has a very good coverage on classes.The examples on the remoting, I cannot get working even thoughI have had the ones in wrox books working.It is true the asp.net coverage is non existent, but if moreexplanations and clearly laid out downloadable examples wereprovided , this could have been a very good book..Net remoting is a very important topic and having removedthat from the books make this book very dull since alot ofother topics are not covered in this book."
2,Lightweight.,Her theoretical suppositions are vastly underdeveloped. This book is primarily: 1)Straightforward documentation of outdated VR examples. 2)Practical approach to constructing models with regard to polygon counts and load times. 3)A chance for Bertol to publish plenty of her own tacky renderings. Too much the other side of Marcos Novak's trans-diarrhea...
5,Anthology of Erotic Fiction: Desires,"I've never sent a review in to Amazon before, but this book is a little different. Benedicks and Sengupta have collected some of the best erotic stories I've read in quite some time. Not only have they published stories in the book from writers such as Jakubowski, Mohanraj, Roche and Reed. They have introduced me to some new and very talented authors. Authors I hope to see more of in the future. The stories are erotic, romantic, hot, humorous, and lusty. A very beautiful gamut of reading material. I hope to see more from them in the future. This text refers to the Hardcover edition."
5,"Sexiness, Sophistication, and Dialogue in *Desires*","I'd like to mention that this is the most sophisticated collection of erotica I've come across . . . Of course, ""sophisticated"" is usually conceived of as being opposed to ""fun"" (or, more appropriate here, ""really sexy""). I have to say that this isn't the case with *Desires*. I bought a copy, on a whim, for my partner on Valentine's Day. As sugary sweet as that often regretable holiday may be, this book is free from all that watered-down, pre-processed sentimentality that is usually a hallmark of soft-core sex writing. Which isn't to say it's not tender . . . very quietly and beautifully tender. Also attractive is the very intelligent afterward--a conversation on the nature and appeal of erotica between the two editors. Dialogue seems an appropriate note for the book to end on, as each of the stories depicts characters having their own kinds of arousing ""intercourse."""
4,Mittie's Song,"What women really don't want is someone like John Silver's. What a creep! William was a sleeze bucket in his own realm; he knew the right words. I hated that Mittie was so misled. I enjoyed the suspense and it kept me rivited. I felt for Mittie, she was too trusting. This novel hit on subjects that hit home for many women. It's neat that this author is brave enough to write a novel on this subject. I'm hoping there is a sequel. Bravo!"
4,Rare Find,"I found Mittie's Song hidden away in a popular bookstore. I had never heard of the author or the publisher before. Both my wife and I felt connected to the story. It expressed how unfair things were to women in the past. The historic elements of the late 40's Los Angeles were very accurate, as were the attitudes of the times. We both wish the author the best of luck. It would be nice have seen this novel on the front shelve. Maybe a larger publisher might have helped this GREAT novel get into the hands of more people, and keep the price down. It was worth the money to experience this fresh new author. I found his website and see he is working on other interesting sounding novels:"
4,Great read for the historian,"The book is rather dry and reads like a college text, but if information is what you are after you just may have hit the MOTHER LOAD!!This book saved my research paper."
4,Super Nice! High quality,This towel is going to be a favorite. The quality is excellent and the colors are nice and rich. A must for a Wildcat fan.
4,Very Helpful and Easy to Read,"Filled with tons of practical information, it covers all the bases that almost anyone beginning or interested in beginning a vegetarian/vegan diet wants to know. It does so in a simple, friendly, and informal manner. The ""tips"" and ""callouts"" are especially valuable. Easy & enjoyable reading, and highly recommended."
4,Definitely worth the money,"Just purchased this book a few days ago and am very pleased. It is a quick and easy read, packed with a multitude of information. This book manages to hit all major areas of vegetarian concerns, outlining the basics and giving suggestions for further reading. This book is a great springboard for getting you started in your new diet and includes a wonderful, not too complicated menu section."
2,Just Okay,"I don't know what I was expecting when I got and began reading this book, but it's not quite what I expected--if that makes any sense. This book really skims the surface of vegetarianism, and I was looking for something more. It's a good reference source, and the recipes are simple on paper. I'll probably be able to better appreciate this book after I've had a chance to read others."
2,Nothing to write home to mom about,"Book was full of ideas like ""Open a can of beans, put on toast"". Nothing spectactular at all. I am sure there are other books that have actual meals that veg-heads canmake and suitable ides, but this one is not it."
4,excellant information revealed,"This publication brings together a lot of information , one would have to gleen from reading extensive other material in multiple books and magazines. Thanks."
3,Excelente Información en un formato dificil de asimilar,"Este es un gran libro que revela el mecanismo del orgasmo masculino y presenta ejercicios para adquirir control sobre los procesos involucrados. El material se presenta con la perspectiva de la filosofía taoista, desafortunadamente el diseño tipográfico desordenado exige que el lector tenga mucho cuidado en distingir entre los consejos, los ejercicios y el texto principal. Los ejercicios son difíciles de realizar pero vale la pena hacerlos y darles tiempo para que sus efectos se asimilen por el cuerpo."
2,A poor value,"Tablets are VERY tiny, & require up to 6 a day as dose.This creates the false impression that you are getting a bargain.You aint.Try another brand.They are garlic, though."
2,Odd fit,"Likes the Original insoles and tried these, but ended up switching back. The size was off and the arch support seemed too far forward for me. Sent them back and the seller quickly refunded."
4,Sore feet saver,"I've worn the Powerstep insoles for about three years, since recommended by a podiatrist friend to help with my plantar fasciitis. They helped in a very short time. They feel quite odd and hard for the first day or two, but then I didn't want to be without them and could walk or stand for MUCH longer MUCH more comfortably than before. I decided to try the Powerstep Pinnacles this time. While I like them much better than not having them in my shoes, I think I'll stick with the slightly less expensive regular Powerstep in the future. These seem like they'd be more comfortable (there's more cushion in the heel), but I find my feet to be sore sooner than with a new set of the regular Powerstep."
1,not received,"Item not received yet , despite payment made.Can you please send it as soon as possible before I leave negative feed back.Thanks."
4,Shake Hands With the Devil - Great Movie,"""Shake Hands with the Devil"" is an Awesome depiction of the genocide in Rwanda and the U.N. unable to stop the killings."
4,shake hands with the devil,"excellant film but it shows how governments have different priorities in who to protect.the free world should be ashamed as to there response for a people crying out for help. reminds me of germany late 30,s. buy it and weep.RJB"
5,The best book ever,This is Harry Kraus' best book every in my opinion. It is well written and very suspenseful. I have recommended it to many family and friends for their enjoyment.
4,Suspenseful mystery makes for Informative fiction,"Harry Kraus will keep you engaged throughout as he unveils the mystery behind the death of one character and the serious injury of another. Crafting the story with authentic language, using lots of medical jargon, Kraus manages to do so without making the reader feel ignorant. True Kraus throws in lots of red herrings along the way, leading you to suspect a number of different people, still you'll find that the conclusion makes sense."
5,Best Screenwriting Video Class For Digital Filmmakers,It took me a few months to get through all 19 of these videos but now I have a great script! Lots of info on things I never learned in any writing or film class. Special focus on digital film making and animation too. This first video is a good intro to themes and basic story ideas. There are samples of this class on YouTube which is how I found out about it.
2,Overheats after a few minutes.,"Update to initial review. Have not used the slicer very often. Initially, it worked very good. Now it overheats after a few minutes and have to let it sit for 30 minutes before it will come back on. Can't take it apart to see if it needs lubricating."
2,Under powered - constantly shutoff due to overheat,"It's a good unit however it is way underpowered. It's constantly shutoff by itself due to overheat. One reviewer below mentioned that he used it for his restaurant but I am sure it won't last 15' in a real restaurant. Slicing ham, cheese and other soft foods is fine but it won't stay on more than 30 minutes on softly frozen meat. Buy it if you'll ONLY uses it on soft foods."
1,Did not work anymore after 5 minutes,I purchased this one based on the good reviews here.I am disappointed to the slicer.The first one I got only worked for the first 5 minutes. Luckily I was able to get a replacement.The second one works but the bladder rotates pretty slowly.It's hard to slice frozen meat. It's probably suitable for vegetable in my mind.Updated:The replacement was DEAD too after the second time I used it. I just sliced two small pieces of frozen meat without bone.
4,"Nice slicer, easy to clean","I bought this slicer to actually use at my restaurant. We have a very tight budget so we couldn't buy the big commercial units. I was concerned it couldn't handle the load but it performs really well. It's a little bit of a pain to hold the button down but it is a safety feature as well. I cut enough meat for the week in about an hour. The BEST part of the slicer is it is so easy to clean. The blade removes in one twist and I can store it at ""O"" so no one can possible cut themselves."
2,Why China ware ?,"The Unit is a well copied knock-off, and the question remains why from CHINA, when Italy makes wonderful Slicers (Affettatrichi). With larger blades and more weight to stay on the counter.The motor is weak but I guess OK for baloney, Spanish Serado ham is a problem. The thicknesswheel is a typical plastic junkee, and the total production value was under $ 5 or maybe 7 when a NEEDED extra blade is included. (which was missing in mine and backordered)That value includes packaging. Now you figure what you get. Markups do not improve a product."
1,Fishy Reviews,"Interesting how the two reviewers ""Carmen"" and ""Silvia"" have only reviewed two books and both books were written by the same author: Dina C Carson.Ethics, people. Ethics!"
5,WOW! Tons of Terrific Theme Ideas,"This book is the perfect inspiration for creating a themed event. I can=t believe how many times I said to myself, Awhy didn=t I think of that?@ while reading this book! Even though the book is geared toward large events, the principles can be applied to a celebration of any size. This book is full of creative ideas to make your theme event truly memorable. It contains something for everyone regardless of the age of the guest or the size of the celebration. I liked this book so much that I=m planning to give it away as gifts. After all, who doesn=t have to plan a celebration or two every year? No doubt this book will become my party-planning guide, year after year."
5,WOW,I just saw Christina on tour with Justin Timberlake in San Antonio and it was AMAZING! I quickly rushed to buy this dvd and its so cool! Christina is very talented and I LOVE THIS DVD!it has beautiful and fighter and other stuff its great!
1,how can they say anything,how can they say anything about this dvd whan it hasnt even been out how do they know if its good or not
1,Requires you to install Starforce malware.,This game may be great but I will never know because I refuse to risk the security and functionality of my system by installing Starforce copy protection software. In the past I've had to replace my DVD/CD drive because of it. This software is not disclosed to you when purchasing a product that requires you to install it. Beware!
4,Great idea!,"This music stand is great. I can fit it in the back of my amp, or in my guitar case. The only complaint is that it is not as safe as the traditional stands, but it is still really cool. I use it all the time now."
2,"Not good for 1:55 cars (like ""Cars"" cars)","I bought this for my son because I wanted him to have another way of playing with his ""Cars"" cars (instead of smashing them and having them get chipped). I couldn't tell from the description if the lanes would fit any size diecast cars - they don't. The ""Cars"" are a bit bigger than typical Hot Wheels so they were slightly too large to fit in the lanes. This was disappointing since it seemed like the best multiple lane racetrack out there at a decent price.The first time I unfolded it, it snapped apart but I was able to snap it back together.I can't comment on the ""funness"" because I returned it before my son played with it."
1,JUNK!,The sad part is mt grandson would have loved this if it stayed together. As it is you're letting your self in for some frustrating moments. Fasten it down to something sturdy and save yourself some aggravation.
2,don't spend $40 for this!,"My 3 year old loves this racetrack, but it is very flimsy. I wouldn't spend over $15 or $20 for it."
2,may cause tears,"My 4 and 2 year old were very excited when they first received this toy, but it quickly turned into frustration for both of them shortly after using the track. It falls down very easily and the segments of track pull apart constantly. They get a few runs in and they start yelling that it's not working. I then have to put it back together and cross my fingers it will last for 5 more minutes. I hate to say the fun it does provide is not worth the hassle and upset. Perhaps this toy would work for older children, but I don't recommend it for the younger crowd."
1,thin plastic and falls apart constantly,"I am very disappointed that this relatively expensive toy is just a cheap piece of plastic. The track is very delicate and falls over or falls apart constantly. If it were better constructed it could be a lot of fun, but my grandchildren are just frustrated with this toy that they really looked forward to receiving. Not a fair price at all."
4,Car track,"Great track for my 5 year old boy who loves to race cars. Like that it folds up is easy to carry or pack with 4 cars for a trip. It can be tricky for him to set up after its folded, easy for an adult or older child to do though. Would recommend"
4,good for parents and kids!,"Unlike a million other car tracks on the market this one does not involve time for assembly nor time for looking for all the parts. In that sense it makes life so much easier for the parents! There are only 4 pieces. They click together easily. And they store neatly as one piece.I bought it for our 2 year old and he loves it. He loves to guess which car will win and understands the lanes and the numbers. His older cousins have as much fun with it as he does.The one drawback of the toy is the stability of the support for the higher car track. It should be a little stronger.Overall, great fun, great value for money, and a great gift idea for any kid."
4,Kind of flimsy but what do you expect for the price,"This toy folds up nicely. Seems like it might not last too long, but I am happy for the price. My 4yr old boy really likes it."
4,Successful Birthday Gift for Four Year Old,"My daughter was hosting a race-car themed birthday party for her four year old son...my grandson. This gift was most welcome as it was easy to set up, very durable, and went with the theme of the day. In fact, I gave it to my grandson the day before his birthday; and my daughter found her husband playing with it after the children went to bed. (The price was just right and...) everyone enjoyed it."
5,Great toy to burn time,i got the hot wheels 4 lane raceway and me and my kid have been playing with it for hours everyday after school a great way to get a kid interested in other things. the ps3 and xbox have no control over him any more.
3,"Flimsy design, but fun toy.","Once this thing is put together, if you don't bump into it too hard, it's a lot of fun. I got this for my 3.5 year old and he keeps asking me to ""fix it"". The sections come apart very easily and it's a flimsy construction at best.The cool thing is, that you can add Hot Wheels orange track sections to it at the bottom, so the cars keep going way past the checker flags. I had this thing stretched out to about 15ft.So, fun factor 5! Construction/durability, eh, 2-3."
3,Basic Fun,"I like it because it's low tech----easy to assemble, no batteries, very little to go wrong. My six year old had a lot of fun with it staging a ""race elimination"" among many of his hot wheels and other small cars. This doesn't need batteries or electric----just gravity and kid power. It's one of those basic things, that with a little imagination, becomes something to occupy the little one for a long time."
5,Hot wheels race track,"I bought this race track as a gift for my 2 year old, race car obsessed, nephew. My son, who is 8, has the same track and has played with it for three years. Both boys love their tracks. The track is easy to set up, put away and store and can be taken along on trips, playdates etc.. It is so simple (gravity!), yet has provided hours of play. It's easy enough for a toddler and still fun for an older boy, as well as those in between (we have lots of pre-school-grade school visitors). I'd recommend this to anyone who has too many hot wheels around their house, and doesn't want to wrestle with setting up the complicated twisty tracks."
5,Years of Enjoyment!,"We got this for my little guy over a year and a half ago (he was 2 1/2) and he still loves it (almost 4 yrs)! Plays with it constantly. If he could only pick one toy in the playroom, this would be it."
3,Fun but difficult to keep together,We purchased this toy for our 2 and 4 year olds. The boys love to play with it but it is very difficult to keep together and in an upright position.
5,FANTASTIC TOY,Everyone who has ever been to a pine wood derby knows how much the kids love to race random things down the track. this nice simple toy lets your kids get all the pine wood derby they want. It is very simple to put up unlike most of the modern hot wheels tracks. And if folds down very small for storage. We raced for hours the day we opended it. the winner flag system is amazingly simple and effective. this will last for years unless somebody steps on it really really hard.
2,Keeps falling apart,"It looks convenient and easy to use doesn't it? How much simpler can you get? Well, every time we go to unfold it, it splits in 1/2. The piece attached to the tower doesn't fold out smoothly, the secondary support constantly collapses, and then the middle hinges come unhinged. My son - who is very gentle with his toys - can make a few runs before something gives out, but he gets frustrated and soon bores with it.This is not worth the money I paid. The only good thing about it really is that it does fold up and is easily stored.I think most of the reviews must be fakes."
2,Let's go 2.5 stars,"It's a fun toy for my 4-year-old and probably would be for kids a few years older too, but where it scores points for fun, it gets dings for construction quality. It's easily knocked over, and when it falls, several links of track usually fall apart. The plastic is rigid and the parts fit together (more accurately, stay together) poorly. (which also could describe the Pontiac G6 rental car I drove around last week, but that's another review). The other complaints you've read about this toy's durability aren't isolated."
3,Item delivered on time and is as expected,"Not very sturdy, but easy to fold and store away.My 2 and 4 years old boys loved it."
2,Could be a great toy but.....,"Great idea, to bad its poorly built. It started falling apart almost instantly. I have a hard time setting it up and taking it down with it crumbling. I love the idea of storing it folded up, but its nearly impossible to fold it up properly when it falls in 4 pieces. Even when it is set up, one small bump the wrong way and it starts to fall apart. This could be a great toy, my son has a wonderful time with it until its in pieces on the floor."
3,"Fun, but I wish the race lanes were wider.","I love this track because it folds away, it is easy to use and my 3 year old has a blast - BUT - I wish the lanes were a little wider. This toy is meant for hot wheels cars, so the lanes are too narrow for vehicles from the Cars and Cars2 series. This is pesky because kids who like hot wheels invariably love 'Cars' vehicles too. The Cars and Cars2 tracks work with the slightly wider vehicles AND with the slightly more narrow hot-wheels and match-box models - and there is no reason this play track couldn't be slightly wider to accommodate both.Still - great toy, hours of fun and no batteries (hurray!)."
5,Great fun and no batteries!!,"Any toy my kids will play with for more than 20 minutes is worth writing a positive review. They'll play with it for even longer, and it doesn't take batteries?! Fabulous!My son got this when he was 3, and is now nearly 5 and still plays with it quite often. The only minor annoyance is that he still can't figure out how to fold it up to put away, and since we like to teach self-sufficiency around here that's a small drawback. Son's older sister likes to play along with him, too. It's fun to find things they can play together with."
3,so so,"It doesn't take much to knock this thing down. I guess I expected something more permanent and sturdy. This would work great as a travel car race track. Maybe my three boys play rough, but it seems to collapse a lot."
3,"BIG Fun for kids, but not too sturdy","My boys LOVE this toy, but me, notsomuch. It's flimsy plastic and one of the ramp connectors broke just a day or two into use. It's still useable, but I have to stay close by to keep fixing the ramp so that it stays up. My kids would give it 5 stars as it's big fun for them to race their Hot Wheels. I have found it annoying that it wasn't sturdy enough to withstand normal play."
5,HOT WHEELS TRACK,"I purchased this track for my 3 year old grandson. I have watched him line up his cars like they are on the highway, he has a lot of cars. He loves this track and he lines up his cars to watch them hit the finish line."
2,Hot Wheels raceway,This product arrived broken. It was not well packed or packaged - but not designed for durability anyway.I won't purchase another.
2,Love the toy - HATE the price!!,c'mon Amazon $39.99 for this?...my son really wanted it and his uncle was going to buy it via Amazon for Christmas...luckily I was at Target yesterday and saw it for $14.99 on sale from $19.99 (which was its normal price)...anyway for a Hot Wheels toy (NOT their cars which are SWEET!!) this one actually is pretty cool...designed well...sturdier than other Hot Wheels Track Toys...and extremely portable...but buyer beware!!...at 200% of Target/Toys-R-Us normal price for the same item...make sure you shop around on this one
4,Overpriced,Bought this today at JCPenny at our local mall. 25.00 - 40% Discount = 15.00... also got the Moon In My Room for 10.00. Both overpriced here.
2,Fun but ultra cheap,"Fun but the braces are worthless, have some boxes to prop it up with. The connectors fall apart if bumped. Great idea but ruined by it's cheap design."
4,Great gift for little boys,"My sons got this two years ago. They were ages 3 and 5. They have played with it consistently over the last two years. They love the fact that at the end of the track there are markers that tell you which car came in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th. No squabbling over whose car won. I only gave it four stars because it is a little flimsy and I have had to help them with set up and take down sometimes to keep it from coming apart. If you have boys who are rough with toys, this may end up junked, as I saw it at a friend's house. But if you take care with it, it will last and can be fun for a large age range: maybe ages 2 to 9?"
3,Disappointed,"My son LOVES this thing. However, was expecting better quality. It's VERY flimsy and can fall apart easily if bumped. For the price, would expect better quality product. Whatever happened to the days where toys were made sturdy instead of cheap plastic?"
4,Not Stable,"Works as expected, but not as stable as one would like. My girls don't put it through too much wear-and-tear, but I could imagine other (e.g. little boys) might be frustrated if they use it more often and it keeps falling apart/over."
2,"Good idea, build quality lacking","This portable raceway sounded like a great idea, Our 3 yr old grandson has fun with it, but he requires assistance when setting it up as the sections come apart easily. And the raceway itself is rather flimsy. Design and quality of materials leave a lot to be desired."
2,Easily falls down,The track falls easily and folds the wrong way falling which caused it to break on the hinges. Our 6 year old did not enjoy it long and for the price paid we expected more of a quality product.
4,"Fast, flimbsy, durable, fun","Fun track to play with along side my son. He enjoys it as well. Very easy to set up and let the cars fly.Now when I say this, remind you that this is very durable and hasn't broken yet. It's a bit flimsy. The track can come apart into 3 sections. And it comes apart very easily if it's bumped just a bit too hard or is moved. There are clips on the bottom of 2 sections that help with the sort of sturdy construction. The top elevation stand is on a hinge and will fold up on you if the track is bumped or moved a bit. When a kid is excited to play with this, it's going to move and fall apart, no way around this.Gave it a 3 star on educational. Not much to learn from this except restraint, and good motor skills in putting it back together properly.It does fold up nicely and has 4 little locks to keep it together. Easy to store."
3,fun toy when it stays together!,"I have two boys, 3 and 5, that got this a year or two ago. They really love testing every car to see who comes in first but I find this toy frustrating. It falls apart every single time I take it out or put it away! It drives me nuts! If this were built better to make it more durable this would be an awesome toy!"
4,A lot more fun than you'd think,I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter for Xmas. Her and her 6 year old old sister are in love with this toy. It seems quite durabale as they have both fallen on it and stepped on it numerous times. Most of my daughter's cars are of the Disney Pixar variety and were either too wide or too tall for use on the track. Be sure to have plenty of thin and low profile cars on hand.I decided to make it an educational toy by having the girls tell me why they thought certain cars kept winning races. To my surprise they grasped the concept quickly and really got into the experiment phase of the game. I was also surprised that they would much rather play with the race track than their dollhouses or video games.I paid $35 for the race track well over MSRP but it was worth it.I whole heartedly reccomend this toy.
2,Another cheap hot wheels set,"I think I may have hit my limit with Hot Wheel sets. This one collapses NON-STOP. I have to tie it up with wires, but that only solves the top tier problem. I have yet to find a Hot Wheels set that doesn't become a pile of plastic in our game room. My best Hot Wheels suggestion is to just get the orange track with the piece that screws it (temporarily)to a table and let your kids build their own cool tracks."
5,Four lane drag racing track.,Track was very inexpensive but works well. Some of the longest cars don't fit in the starting gate. The whole package is fun because four racers can use it at once. You have to add track for the runout or you have the cars going everywhere. Finish line device works well. I would recommend this toy highly.
4,Good toy,"My son really likes to play with this toy. It does everything it says it will, however it is kinda flimsy. Overall I would by this toy again though."
3,Hot Wheels 4 lane raceway,"My son who is 5 enjoyed this toy for a few weeks, but would have rather had Criss Cross Crash. I liked the idea of no batteries and fell for the typical rah! rah! reviews that you get online. We actually bought 2 of these and gave one to his cousins ages 2 1/2 - 5. The 3 1/2 year old was pretty exited about it, but once again the pizazz wore off in a few weeks."
5,Great intro to Hot Wheels,"Was a big hit on Christmas day especially since my son does not anything but Thomas the Tank toys to be the best. After he finally played with it, he really enjoyed it and said it was one of his best Christmas gifts. I found it to be pretty durable and since it folds up convenient to store when not in use."
4,Continued Fun,My son plays with the raceway all the time. He especially likes the fact that you can add on tracks to this raceway as well as other hotwheel attachments. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Finally a racestrip that doesn't have to slide together.,"I hated the race strips that interlocked by sliding together and then hooking on a door, chair, or anything you could clip it to. This makes so much sense and is so fun and so easy to set up. I had the old race strips for my boys, but I bought this for my 2, 3 and 6 yr. old grandsons, and they love it!!! They've accidentally tripped over it, and while it came apart, it didn't break, we just snapped it back together."
3,"Very flimsy, I anticipate a quick end to this toy",I can't believe this is $32.99 on Amazon. I got it for $19.99 at Target and was just thinking it's worth closer to $15. The connectors are very weak and I don't expect them to last long. It is definitely fun but the 4 pieces come apart very easily which means we'll constantly be putting it back together and putting more stress on those cheap feeling connectors. I will be surprised if at least one of the connections doesn't break in less than a week. I'll come back and edit if I was wrong. ;)
3,Exterior is poor quailty but appears to perform well,The first thing I noticed when taking this out of the box is how light it is. It tends to slide around a bit when you open and close it but once fully loaded with bottles that wasn't as much of an issues.The door itself has a plastic border and each corner has a visible line that doesn't appear in the product picture. It looks like either a crack or a place the paint didn't properly cover. Visually detracts from the product but I can live with it.The internal racks feel cheap and are loud when you put bottles in or take them out but i plan on buying the upgraded wooden shelves.I am happy with the cooling performance of this unit so far. It was able to reach the desired temperature fairly quickly and once this temperature was reached the unit is fairly quit.Overall I'm a bit disappointed with the exterior finish / quality but so far it's operating well.
3,not happy,The good - the energy efficiency on this unit is very good. It is temporarily set up in my den very close to my woodstove and still burning slightly under one kilowatt per day. The room can get up to 90 degrees.The bad - the interior dept is 12 inches. About one third of my bottles are 13 inches tall and will not fit in the refrigerator. The missing inch is just plain stupid. The engineer that designed this thing should be updating his resume.
2,Won't fit wine bottles. Its way too shallow.,"Everything seemed fine about the cooler until after putting the first bottle of wine I have into it and tried to shut the door and it wouldn't shut. One of my favorite wines is d'Arenberg ""The Dead Arm"" Shiraz, so I have several bottles. Seems like all of d'Arenberg's bottles are 13"" inches tall and don't fit. I'd say that anything 11"" inches would fit fine.Maybe this was mentioned in the product description, but I just assume that anyone that would make a wine cooler would make them such that 99.9% of all 750 ml bottles would fit.All the controls did seem to work fine. Got cool very fast. I didn't like the fact that the front door and handle were plastic instead of steel, but the unit was fairly inexpensive so I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"cheap, does not power on, lousy customer service","Would not power on.Whynter WC-16S SNO 16 Bottle Wine Cooler, Platinum with LockSeller resolved issue, power switch not wired so it clicked on with out powering on light or cooler. Whynter gave me grief on phone and e mail. Seller resolved issue."
5,Simply Outstanding,"This product is Outstanding...Not only do I use it; my wife; 2 daughters; 1 son and all my grandchildren and in-laws. Hard to find, but outstanding product!!"
5,This CD is WICKED COOL!,"Oh my God! This is the most wicked cool CD! It has all the songs (basically) from the original DiC dub! I listen to it all the time! In fact, I listen to it so much, I had to make a cassette copy, just for my lil sis, so i wouldn't have to share. This CD, youi gotta buy it. Although it's short, It's AWESOME!"
5,Absolutly Great!,"I got this CD earlier this year, and this and the Lunarock CD are the only CDs that I ever listen to! If you like the show, then get this CD, my favorite are ""Call My Name and I'll be There"" and ""Carry On"". I think this is one of the best CDs that I have!"
5,2 thumbs way up,"i love sailor moon and scince my causin got the cd, i want to get it. My favorite songs are Salior moon theme, oh starry night, rainyday man, my only love, and its a newday. i love salior moon alot. ( hi mina, g-g, ma)"
4,very very cool JUPITER ROCKS,I've owned this cd for about a year and I think the best song on it would have to be rainy day man I listen to it every day! Oh by the way JUPITER ROCKS
4,~*Cool Soundtrack*~,"Hello Moonies!I just bought SailorMoon:Songs from the hit series,and it is soo cool!It features all the songs shown in the NA version of Sailormoon,Including ""She is the one named SailorMoon!""(I prefer ""Moonlight Densetsu,but this is ok too)I love the songs on this CD,they did such a good job!(not to mention the singers are alot better then the voice actors!)Stan Bush,a famous rock singer,sings one of my favorite songs,""She's got the Power!""That song Rocks! It has such a futuristic beat to it,which makes it sound cool.My other favorite songs are, ""Carry on"" ""Rainy Day Man"" ""Only a Memory Away""(the anime version,not the CD version) ""Oh Starry Night"" ""My Only Love"" The Other songs are ok too,but these songs are my favorite.I also like most of the Japanese SailorMoon songs,they are really good.I have 2 Japanese SailorMoon CD's And 1 English SailorMoon CD(this one).Both Versions are Really good!If you're a SailorMoon fan,buy this CD!"
5,I highly recomend this CD,"They took the best songs from Sailor Moon and put them on this CD. All of the vocal singers match the songs perfectly, you can really get into it. I highly recommend this CD."
4,Kinda childish,"I think there are some good songs, but ""Only a Memory Away"" isnt the same one in the show! and its a little bit tacky stuidoish sounding, buy otherwise, its OK"
5,a MUST for Sailor Moonies!,"It is an incredible soundtrack if you love the show! Not only was it easier for me to just order it this way, but after checking stores and even adding on the normal shipping price, it was cheaper!!! If you're going to get it, this is the way to go! <again, a MUST for a moonie!> :)"
4,Best Sailor Moon Sounds yet,"I've had my Sailor Moon Soundtrack for 3 years, which I recorded from a friend, and have never stopped listening to it. I think that I want to buy the CD version of the soundtrack instead of listening to it by tape. I recommend this to all SM fans and to buy Lunarock also."
2,Would be better if it had the instrumentals...,"Yeah, I'm a guy, but I'd much rather have heard the instrumentals and incidentals from the show. Ah well..."
5,GREAT,"I love the songs on this CD. I especcily like ""My Only Love."" I also like ""I Wanna Be A Star"" and ""Carry On."" I could go on forever, but i won't. Thanks -Tank"
5,This is a must buy for all of you Moonatics!,"THE BEST! A MUST BUY! GET IT AND GO HOME HAPPY!!! I loooovvvveeee this CD it is the best!!! My two favorite songs are My Only Love, and Carry On! THEY ARE SO AWESOME! ANYBODY WHO LOVES SAILORMOON MUST PURCHASE THIS CD!"
4,GREAT MUSIC!!!,"I have bought this CD, and I LOVE it! The music is great! I have had it for about two months, and it already has began to wear out! My cousins love it too. This CD is how I got one of them hooked on Sailor Moon! I mainly like ""I Wanna Be A Star!"",""Rainy Day Man"", ""My Only Love"", and ""Call My Name (And I'll Be There)"". I would recommend this CD for any Sailor Moon fan!"
4,Sailor Moon songs--poppy and sweet; not bad at all,"Even though I am totally against dubbed Sailor Moon, I really enjoyed the music on this CD. Most of the songs are Britney-Spearish, but I wouldn't go overboard and say that it was a horrible CD. The songs are very original and fit the Sailor Moon storyline (unlike the horrible LunaRock CD, which was far worse than this with much more horrible singers and bad dialogue in the music). However, the CD doesn't have many songs (too bad)."
5,It was AWESOME!,"This CD was so great! I loved the songs from the series and it was great to have them on CD. Songs like ""My Only Love"" and ""Carry On"" are the ones you play over and over. I highly recommend this CD for any Sailor Moon Fan!"
3,different songs...,"some of the songs on the cd are different than those in the tv series. for example, ami's only a memory away song is completely different. the cd is good but i was slightly disappointed cus they changes some of the songs.... but buy the cd anyway. its fun to listen to.-shenlong_mizuno mizuno@mindless.com"
5,This is a GREAT CD!!,"This CD is wonderful. The only song I don't like is 10: She's got the power. It's the only song sung by a guy, and he really doesn't have a very good voice. All of the other songs are simply fantastic.I have to say that Rainy Day Man and My Only Love are my favorites. I love the episode My Only Love comes from.The others are also good.#6 and #7 are from episode 40 and are delightful. I would definetly buy this CD if I had to do it over again. It's worth the money."
5,SAILOR MOON: SONGS FROM THE HIT TV SERIES,"For all of you Sailor Moon fans that have been there from the beginning, this CD is definitely for you! This CD has all of the songs that appeared in the show: Rainy Day Man->when Lita's best friend got attacked and he was hospitalized; Only A Memory Away->when Amy almost left to pursue a career in medicine; My Only Love->when Darien and Serena learned their past and their secrets were revealed (he was Prince Darien and she was the Moon Princess); and 8 more songs that help to relive precious Sailor Moon moments. But don't get me wrong, this CD is not only for Sailor Moon fans that were there from the beginning, but also for fans of all kinds. All of the songs are sung by the scouts themselves. So if you like Sailor Moon, then this is the CD for you!"
5,Sailor moon and Sailor venus rock,the Sailor moon soundtrack is one of the best cds around i may only be 11 but i know what i like this cd has even a song dedicated to each scout like my only love (sailor moon) i wanna be a star (sailor venus) yeah well i only have one thing to say buy this now!!!!!!!!
3,This is a GREAT CD,"This CD is great, but my one major gripe is getting the other scouts to sing. Hearing Sailor Moon is all fine and well, but there are other scouts, too. Other than that this CD really is great. If you are a true Sailor Moon fan you will go out and buy it. My fave songs are ""Rainy Day Man""(Sailor Jupiter) and ""My Only Love""(Sailor Moon)."
3,Luna Rock was better,"Ehhh... this C.D was the first C.D I got for X-mas.... Of coarse I loved it @ first... but now I love my LunaRock. It has good songs, even though I hate the T.V show *the dubbed version, I love the Japanese version* It could have been better. If u want it, u can have it. Ain't my prob. if u get LunaRock and love LunaRock more! Like I do!"
1,This is the WORST CD ever!,this cd is not worth any stars ata ll but since i had to pick i chose 1. If you have ever seen the japanese version of sailormoon you world relise that the people ripped it to shreds making it one of the worst tv shows ever. If you are below 3 years of age you will like this cd and even then it will give parents a headache!
5,Tahnee,"Great cd from sailor moon live actionall the sailor scouts have there on song to singsongs names areKirari*SailorDream! (""Sparkle*Sailor Dream!"") SAE2. Katagoshi ni Kinsei (""Venus Over My Shoulder"") KOMATSU Ayaka (Minako)3. Over Rainbow Tour SAWAI Miyuu (Usagi)4. Sakura Fubuki (""Cherry Blossom Storm"") KITAGAWA Keiko (Rei)5. C'est La Vie~watashi no naka no koi suru bubun(""That's Life~The Loving Part Inside Me"") KOMATSU Ayaka (Minako)6. Kirari*SailorDream! Original Karaoke"
5,"THE BEST CD EVER, YOU MUST GET IT...okay","If you love or like the sailor Moon show, than you must have the CD. My Fav. song on the CD is My Only Love, because it reminds me of a guy I really, really like(I'm not gay,I'm a girl), but all the songs are grrrrreat! If I could I would give it 1 millon star if not more! It is a must buy CD for all!"
5,Wicked Cool CD!!!,"""My Only Love"" is of course, the best. I was kinda bummed about ""Only a Memory Away"", but it is still a good song. ""Oh Starry Night"" really great, and so are all the rest! I highly recommend this if you are a serious moonie! It's, as Usagi (Serena/Sailor Moon) would say, ""wicked cool""! Yeah! Buy this CD!"
5,Got To Love SM,"I love this CD! I worship the show but, beyond that, I sing my praise for this CD. It's fun. My personal favorite is ""It's a New Day"" and also the song ""Give Me the Strength"". Kid Rhino and DiC did a good job with this one!"
5,A++++,Ok I find myself listening to this CD more than my daughter. The songs are so cathcy and cute. I got the CD for my daughter for christmas and gave it to her early and she loved it. she knew all the songs and cause they are from the series. She prefers this one cause all the songs are in english. Well if your kid is a sailor moon fan then this is your CD. You'll soon find yourself wanting to be a sailor scout also :)~
5,Sailor Moon is the best Japanese Anime out there!,I love this CD and hope to get the second one soon!
5,THE BEST CD EVER!!!!!!,"It was fab! I loved how if you watch the show, you realy understand what the songs are about."
5,I love this Cd,I listen to it every chance I get I love Carry on and Rainy day man. I love to sing along with them! /*-.-*\ >^.^<
5,Awesome!!,"Konnichi wa! I have had this CD for a long time and as stupid as it sounds, I absolutely love it!! As strange as THIS sounds, the song, ""Carry On"" is so inspirational to me!! If you like Sailor Moon, you'll love this CD!!"
4,Good CD for most anime fans!,"I used to love Sailor Moon but i lost interest in it very very quickly, however i still really enjoy listening to the soundtrack! You dont have to love Sailor Moon to be able to enjoy the CD!!!"
3,Sailor Moon Soundtrack,"Ok, this CD is pretty good, expecially the ones like Rainy Day Man and the Theme songs to Sailormoon. If you don't understand Japanese/don't want to learn, this is the CD for you. However, if you DO understand Japanese, this CD will be somewhat of a shock. These songs are ok, but they stand no chance against the originals. Anyway, ja ne, minna-san!~*Silver*~"
5,Don't wait,"I am one of the biggest Moonies out there, and if you love the show, you have GOT to love the music. I have not listened to this CD yet, but I plan to buy it soon. I have heard all the songs on it from the show, and let me tell 'ya..... YOU WON'T BE SORRY! These are great songs I'm SURE you will love.Artemis13"
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,I LOVE THIS CD! im an expert on Sailor Moon my fav song has got to be oh starry night and shes got the power. I'd have to rate this cd with 5 stars because i think the album is great and i just love sailor moon.
4,Great CD!,"This was a great a CD - it features My Only Love, a brilliant song! My only complaint is that Amy's song, Will You Miss Me (only A Memory Away) is slight different. Ah well. It's still an excellent soundtrack."
4,BEST CD EVER,THis is a great CD for any Sailor Moon fan. My favriot songs are My only love and Carry On. The only song that I don't really like is Only A Memory Away. THis CD would be good for any age.
4,"It's a GREAT CD, I truly LOVE it!!!!!!","Its a fantastic CD and I really love the song ""My Only Love"", it makes me wanna cry. The rest of the songs are really good but I really wish there were some Japanese type music to it too. But its really great so get it now and don't miss out on a great chance to listen to the great songs off of the Sailor Moon TV series!!!!!!!!"
3,Fairly good.,"It has some good songs with some good tunes and great lyrics. If you're an addict who can't survive without anything remotely related to our favourite pretty suited sailor soldiers (i.e. you actually played Torin's Passage all the way through just to see Hotaru), then buy it. If you've only been exposed to DiC's dub and never heard the Japanese songs, buy it. If you have heard the Japanese and you aren't an addict, leave it"
3,"OK, but by no means great","I've read better books. It bounces from small moment to small moment. Nothing climactic at all. The author never went into great detail about the people in the story and, even though I live here, couldn't figure out where anything actually took place, which is strange. I only recommended this book to one person because she likes to read about odd happenings in odd cities. Corvallis definitely qualifies as odd."
1,Not a good album.,"What happened to michael jackson,madonna,stevie wonder,prince and many more.............??????"
4,Lee Rocker slappin' it on Vinyl!!!!,"Limited Edition 10"" vinyl LP Upright and Kickin' is a compilation of most the same live tracks previously featured on the 'Lee Rocker Live' CD - exception: Mind Your Own Business and Redneck Mama were deleted with Rumblin Bass and Put Your Cat Clothes On added as substitutes. Sound quality is great and notes indicate it was Produced by Lee Rocker himself.Band features:Lee Rocker - Kickin' the Upright Bass and vocalsBrophy Dale - guitar, slide guitar and vocalsAdrian Demian - guitar and vocalsJimmy Sage - drumsTara novick - guitar on Cat ClothesUnfortunatley, this is the only Lee Rocker album available on vinyl so ya better snatch one up quick!!! Sure would like to see some of Lee's later albums on vinyl....Track Listing:RestlessLove Me GoodThat's Alright MamaMiracle In MemphisEverybody's Trying To Be My BabyPlease Don't TouchLittle Piece Of Your LoveLittle BusterRumblin' BassPut Your Cat Cothes On"
5,Insecurities....,"Robin Wilson has always seemed to be in the limelight due to the fact that ever since she lost weight, she has become more popular than she has ever dreamed of being. Now, a co-captain of Sweet Valley's cheerleading squad, Robin is under pressure to keep on top of things and try to maintain her 'perfect' image. With the arrival of her boyfriend George Warren's close friend Vicky, Robin's insecurities re-surface and she begins to feel aspects of paranoia. The main aspect being that of her weight. Soon, Robin is starving herself to try and take control of her life and problems. Will she be able to realise her condition before it's too late?"
2,Mingus Ho Hum,"I love Charles Mingus, but this album is boring. Mingus is best showcased when he does his own compositions or arrangements, or some dissonant interpretation of a standard. Here, we just get chorus after chorus of horns blowing over a simple blues. This is nothing but a late night jam session, and if it weren't for Mingus's name, this never would have seen reissue."
4,Exceptionally Good,- Easy to understand. Well explained. It served my purpose and I think it is a good start for people who want to start from basic and move up to understand enclosures.
3,O.K. but not worth the price.,"The h2o body gloss is a ""dry oil"" spray. The scent is fairly fresh. Like a nice soap with a hint of mint that in this product..... (the mint) I wish wasn't there. The overall scent is pleasent though. The gloss works well enough. Best on damp skin. It is not intensely moisturizing though. ONly buy if you LOVE dry oils...... doesn't work terribly well for the price."
1,boring!,"I ordered this dvd hoping to learn more about my favorite band; to have something that I could watch from time to time. However, this DVD is sooooo boring, I watched for maybe first ten minutes and I decided that it is completely waste of time. It is like you are watching documentary on subject that you have no interest in; I was expecting something lot more fun for a documentary about such a crazy rock band. I wish I could return this because it is totally waste of money.I do not like to write reviews because I don't want to misguide people- something that is boring to me may be very interesting to somebody else so I like to keep my opinions for myself- but I was so disappointed with this video that I just had to write something.5 stars for the amazon though- I ordered this DVD together with "" an oral/visual history by RHCP "" (great book by the way), shipping was super fast!!"
4,"HP 17"" a little too big","I have the HP Pavilion 17"" widescreen laptop (9000 series). While the sleeve is supposed to fit a 17"" laptop, it is quite a stretch to get the new computer all the way into the sleeve. The sleeve itself does a great job protecting the laptop while it's in it, but it is almost more of a pain to get it in and out than it's worth. While the sleeve is great and colorful, make sure your laptop is not on the larger edge of the dimensions as, especially with the curved design of the sleeve, it is very difficult to use with some laptops."
3,"Good protection, but...","The sleeve is difficult to get the laptop in, and even harder to get it out of, althought it does seem to get a little easier each day (maybe its stretching a bit. And the zipper can scratch the surface of the laptop if you arent careful. It does protect the laptop nicely."
1,"Do not order this for a Dell Inspiron 17""","This sleeve does not fit the Dell 17"" because of the extended life battery. I called the seller, Mel Pierce Camera and Digital who told me to send the sleeve back for a full refund. It has been 2 months and still no refund."
2,"Didn't fit my 17"" laptop","I have had a hard time finding a laptop sleeve to fit my 17"" laptop (custom manufacturer). I read the reviews, and took the measurements of my laptop and compared it to the dimensions listed carefully, but it still didn't fit. Too bad, because I love the way it looks!"
5,Mom and daughter both happy!,"Is just perfect to take to college! My daughter loves the design, I love the durability and price tag. Colors are more vivid than pic shows."
4,Great item BUT,"I bought this for my new 17 inch HP computer and it doesn't fit. It was a major disappointment. The sleeve is great and pretty but I just couldn't use it. Fortunately, a family member has a 16 inch HP and it fitted perfectly for that one, so it became her early B-day gift."
2,"beautiful, but not very resistant for the laptop.","This is a very beautiful laptop case, but is not very helpfull in cases of falls...."
1,Doesn't fit 17: HP Pavilion,"I tried to /make/ it fit, but this sleeve was just too tight for my laptop --and the trying left me with several zipper scratches on the top of my poor baby."
1,"17"" sleeve didn't fit my 17"" Qosmio computer","The 17"" sleeve didn't fit my 17"" Qosmio computer. My computer is 3"" thick and there was not enough stretch. I gave 1 star because it was very cute."
1,Watch it.....,"Does not fit HP 17"" notebook. 6th Ave. charges back shipping and restocking so it really doesn't pay to return it....."
5,Compelling,"A strong, detailed account of the Hollywood Blacklist. I first read this book for a Jurisprudence class in '72 and recently re-read it and still could not put it down. Vaughn makes a thorough and insightful case for why we should never forget."
1,Too confusing,"I did not like this product. I can't believe you have to watch a DVD to use it. Also, why doesn't it come folded so you don't have to watch the DVD. My 9 lb son does not fit that well in it and cried the whole time once I finally got him in it. I am really disappointed. And I don't have TIME to watch a DVD."
2,Couldn't use mine!,"I bought the hotsling in Zoie print (size 5) after hearing all the great reviews from other mothers. When I got it I found it very confusing to figure out, and had the worst time trying to get her in it! When I did, I could never get it quite right even though I did as the instructions said. As soon as she was in, she would start moving around trying to get out. I never felt comfertable with her in it, being that she was moving so much and would start screaming pretty much right away! If you are to get one, make sure you go somewhere that you can try them on with your baby to make sure you know how to use it correctly and that your baby likes it. I wish I had done this beucase I would never had bought one."
5,A Great dvd player,"I boughted this unit on january eleven and i'm really happy with the quality of the video,sound and versatility of this unit.It's really fantastic is small,and come with car adapter and ac adaptor ready for 110v or 220v.i'm really impressed with the quality of this dvd for a very low price,and all functions that gave you for that low price like,use in home,use in car,use in anywhere that you want.i recommend this unit in a 99% for some one that are looking a portable dvd player for a low price.also can read all formats of dvd.the only format that not read is dvd-ram i have somes but i know that this format is exclusive of panasonic and some other brand.in conclusion don't let that the brand of this dvd don't let you buy it.this unit is made in china but looks pretty good and the most important play very good everything,and the remote control is cool for little and full of options.Hope you try it someday."
1,Poor Quality!,This thing lasted all of 8 months with very limited use. This is very poor quality manufacturing. All I can say is don't buy this brand!
1,Why did they change the flavors?!,"This used to be my favorite hard candy, but a few years back Lifesavers got rid of the original flavors (lemon, lime, orange, cherry and pineapple) Now I think it's watermelon, blackberry, pineapple, orange and cherry (or something similar). I don't like the new flavor line-up and I haven't bought Lifesavers since."
1,Step by Step is Better,"Been a Wrox fan for some time. This is the worst book their team has produced. The material is cursory at best and totally theoretical. Very few practical examples. Never thought I would point to an MSPress Step-by-Step book, however it is far superior to this junk."
3,A Light in the Data Mining Tunnel,I found this book to be helpful in understanding how to utilize multidimensional database design. It was nice to see that Microsoft has some affordable alternatives one can turn to in the data mining and data warehousing market. Once again WROX has produced a helpful product for professionals in the computer industry.
5,Hinges with Screws,Replaced 60+ of these in my home. Look good. Screws included which is not mentioned in the item description.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE HINGES,"I purchased these hinges for the entire house June 1, 2008 and installed them a few months later. Having painted all the woodwork white, now where the hinges are, they leave a black powdery metal residue all around the hinge turning that area black and the black powdery residue also falls to the floor from opening and closing the doors. The mess can be scrubbed or washed off but it is a smeary mess to keep clean particularly where the residue may also fall onto the baseboard below. I would not recommend them to anyone."
5,Great low wattage light bulb for reptiles,It works great for our sierra mountain lizard. They don't need a lot of heat.The light bulb rated at 25 watts with the brightness of 10 watts. The other wattage is from/for heat.Save utility $$$ if you don't need a 100 watt bulb.
2,ok product,"This product seeems as though it would be useful, but the instructor goes a little too fast for people, who are ""beginners""."
2,"Adequate performance, unfortunate orchestration","Oddly strange recording. Very clear voice. Unclear why the English version uses a new orchestration by Larry Hochman, when called for, and the new French translation is needed at all. As for interpretation. Fine. And that's the problem. It's all just fine. No better, no worse.Better suggestion: The Harolyn Blackwell recording of these with better orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick (Mr. Hochman's make the orchestrational error constantly called ""masking"" and tis irritating"".) Blackwell has beautiful voice and interp. skills. Recording entitled ""Strange Hurt"" also includes great cycle by Ricky Ian Gordon."
2,dissatisfied,"CD was in rough shape. looks like it recieved poor care, case looked old and decreppidhad to clean CD. I am very disapointed, and find the unit far overprized considering the shape it is in.I will not buy used items again."
5,*Population ME* & ~then some~,"Population Me: Dwight's latest cd with ten great songs. If You have always been a Yoakam music appreciator than You probably bought this the day it was released, but if You havent picked it up for a listen or two, then highly suggested You do, almost guaranteed IT will stay in Your player on a permanent basis."
3,"great album, flawed recording",This is a very good Dwight album but I must agree with a couple of the other reviewers. The first two songs are unlistenable without dropping the volume or treble way down. They are both good songs but something went wrong in the studio or maybe in the transfer to disc. Maybe all copies are not like this? I would certainly mail mine back for a better copy.
4,One of his better....,"This is one of Dwight Yoakams better albums! I just love the last track, The Back of Your Hand. I guess I like the slower songs on this album, like Population Me, just a lovely track and his voice carries the tune so good. He has a nice mix of country stiles, some slow and some faster but all are very good. Track #8 is also very good, duet with one of country music's biggest stars, Willie Nelson. You might say that Dwight Yoakam is famous for his special voice; I mean, it has a good country twang to it... I really recommend this album and I give it 4 stars out of 5, I would have given it 5 stars if there were more tracks like the last tune on the album, simply the best song on the album!"
3,Fair to Middlin',"To this point I don't think Dwight has released an album I don't love. Indeed unlike many critics, I have been as impressed w/ his most recent albums as his early ones. Dwight can be a masterful crooner of soulfully sad songs, a rockin' honky-tonker who doesn't get carried away with the rock, and the best cover artist I've ever encountered. Indeed his ability to render old standards in a fresh, yet plausible manner is a true sign of his talent. But this album strikes me as uninspired. It's not that Population Me is bad listening, but it is not a towering achievement. Dwight has always struck me as at his best when singing emotionally charged songs and the songs on this album strike me as emotionally sterile. This album is a sight better than a lot of the junk played on the radio these days, but it's not quite up to the high standards Dwight has set for himself w/ his previous work."
3,Great Illustrations by Mr McBride,This book has some great Illustrations by the great Illustrator Angus McBribe. Otherwise it has little to offer the reader. It is a pity as it could of been a very useful book! Maybe Osprey will do something with it!
5,"""van van, he's a used up man""",it is refreshng to have these direct observations both from martin and from his family. political parties have been both contentious roadblocks and beneficial instruments in american history.
5,Fantastic !,"Being a ballet fan and Prince fan, i love this. Cannot believe it is still only available on vhs - Please bring it out on dvd !"
1,Sex on stage,"Why oh why must I watch sex on stage? It was not at all fun to watch this ballet and although the technique was gorgoeus and the lifts superb, the explicit sex acts were too much to bear. If this were a movie it would be rated NC-17. What about art makes it suddenly appropriate? The product was excellent, but the ballet...not so much."
3,Good for kitties if you can get them to eat it.,"My cat seems to enjoy the other Felidae canned food flavor, so I thought I'd try another flavor, to keep him from growing bored or finicky.He seemed reluctant to eat it at first, and then just refused to eat this stuff altogether. He actually didn't eat for nearly two days. I thought he was sick! Turned out he just hates this flavor.But Felidae is a great, protein-rich brand!"
2,Caution this is not White,I bought it because I thought PIAA is a famous brand. But returned the item right away after finding out that it is no way close to Xtreme White. It says 4150K but but I think it is close to 3600K. Not only that it wasn't powerful enough as well.H11 is very unique fitting and it is hard to find in local dealers because only few vehicles use it. Like my 2006 4Runner. So you dont have much options. But recently all the big brands have released this fitting which can be easily found on internet (after a few searches).Finally I bought H11 NOKYA 4500K Magnum with high watt output. I am really happy with it.
1,What a Disappointment,"I loved Nelson's first novel ""The Boy Who Picked the Bullets Up"" and was excited to read the sequel to it. I was so let down by this novel. It was nothing more than a silly sex novel that did not even spark any interest for me. While the first novel made the reader think and feel, this book did nothing for the reader."
1,Absolute Trash,"When someone writes a book, it is assumed that they want people to like it.Perhaps this was not the case with this.Or perhaps I have standards.There was graphic sex, every other page, with no redemption to the characters. There was no reason for them to do the things they did and had I known any of these people in real life, I would have reported them for the criminal acts they committed.If you are looking for a good, quality read, then this is CERTAINLY not the book you want to read. I suggest anything else...a magazine, an advertisement for Jiffy Lube, the back of the toothpaste container...anything but the trash that is encompassed between the front and back covers of this book."
5,Outstanding cane,"This cane has proved to be just what I need. I have been very weak lately because of an illness that makes it difficult for me to walk with my usual confidence in my hilly neighborhood. This cane has a comfortable and stout rubber handle that provides a secure grip for me. It is also very strong, yet not too heavy, and has enough heft to it that I know it will support me and be useful in any unforseen emergency. It will support a 250 pound person. Also, the special snow spike at the end of the cane is easy to engage on icy days and will come in handy when the winter roads up here are slippery and dangerous. I recommend this cane for anyone who needs a ""serious"" cane that will do the job it was intended to do. It is also a beautiful walking aid I am proud to own."
5,AMAZING camera sold by an amazing company!,"This is by FAR the best online seller I've EVER dealt with. These guys were there to help me every step of the way and I eventually went back to them and bought a bunch of accessories and an additional lense. Enzo is the best sales rep ever! If you deal with Cameta Camera, ask for him!Good luck with all your buying ventures, it was a pleasure!Oh yeah, the camera is perfect too, lol! A LOT to learn, but well WELL worth the price."
3,better cameras out there,"The only best thing about this DSLR was that it was the first to have live view amongst amateur dslrs and also came with a swivel LCD which is much more useful than many think. However in face of recent competition, lack of image stabilisation, inability to flip LCD, absence of movie mode are big missing features."
3,Good Product - Not Good Price,"The product itself is an effective pain reliever and handy for those who travel a lot; however, it is overpriced for the amount of tablets it contains."
3,An average ending to a good trilogy.,"This book is not as good as the previous books. I feel that it got confusing with so many characters's story lines.Sure, the book has lots of interesting plots, but it gets hard to follow at times, with so many story lines intersecting. I think the writer tried to hard, and this book ends up being confusing, and also down right boring at times.Still, it's not a bad book, but it falls short of the previous books.It's still worth a read, but be warned that it's a long read, and at times both confusing and boring."
2,"3rd book-Star Trek, String Theory by H. Jarman",I love Star Trek. I read the 1st 2 books of String Theory and had to read the 3rd book to end the story line. The publisher or someone changed the author. This book was tedious to read. I plodded through it because it's STAR TREK.
4,string theory book 3,I thought this was a descent ending to the triogy I think it would have been better If the writing style was different. it was mostly a narritve style format but I like the person to person interaction better and book 3 did not have that as much as the other 2.
3,"Motorcycle: Evolution, Design, Passion","Many nice examples of motorcycling inventions. Fine selection of pictures, covering examples of major breakthroughs in designing motorcycles. In my opinion the book lacks a little more dephs in the individual sections. Overall an ok buy for the price for the one who loves motorcycling."
5,Mr. Ed's Motorcycles,"This is an excellent book , a must have for all historians or collectors. I highly recommend this book to all."
1,V disappointing,"In a few words: photos ok, but not great, historical content seemingly lifted from the Internet (haven't read ANYTHING new), generally speaking the full-length equivalent of this very lazy review."
5,An excellent buy,This book was in excellent conditions even though it was previously used. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is studying early childhood education.
4,Fantastic overview of the poetic movements in the modern era,"A fantastic collection of essays written by famous poets from 1800-1950. The progression of various movements of poetry such as surrealism and the interplay between poetic forms and these movements is fascinating. Imagine reading a treatise on painting by a famous painter! This book is the same, except poets! Poets included are: Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Emerson, Whitman, Dickinson, Hopkins, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Breton, Lorca, Valéry, Césaire, Pound, Eliot, Loy, Hughes, Zukofsky, Stein, Stevens, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Olson."
4,Ecco Game Guide,Excellent tips - great maps - definitely a must have for someone who loves the game and has to make the most out of playing time
2,Mediocre!,I expected better from Avery. They are okay - but pages do not slide in easily - it seems like it will work better for smaller pages...
5,What's a matter with you. Not having a knowledge of the US Constitution????,Get this. It's thorough. I read it many times over. It keeps things in perspective of where we should be as a nation.Sigh!Tom
4,A great reference...,An easy read for quickly boning up on your U.S. constitution and a great reference document for future use. I'd recommend having it in your collection of books.
5,Great!,I got one of these for free in a gift basket at a luncheon.It is super useful and lasted a long time under the heavy weight of law books. I was able to use it for my courses and read a bunch of random stuff. I forgot all of the random stuff already.Please develop a Kindle edition for free.
5,Excellent Book!,"This is truely a wonderful item. It is reference that everyone should have. I orginally bought it just for a copy of the constitution, however, I have found the court cases and other parts to be just as helpful."
5,A wonderful book!,This book is fast becoming one of my main resources for classes in school. It puts all of the things that I needed for the classes in an easy to carry book. It is extremely handy to have compared to a textbook! Great Job!
4,A great purchase,"I am pleased with my purchase. The book is informative although it is the same price as other Pocket Constitutions, this has a few extra tidbits."
5,Must Have Resource for all Citizens of America,"Honestly, I bought this because I needed something to get free shipping. I already had a copy of the Constitution. I ended up selling the other copy once I received this one. I like this version because of all the extra information. The extra information on the Founding Fathers, the fascinating facts, important dates, Amendments that were never ratified, and the section on the Supreme Court were added bonuses. This version is up-to-date because Sonia Sotomayor is even listed here. The only thing I didn't like was that the book is very small. I guess it could be a good thing because you can carry it anywhere but it's so small you might lose it. For the price, just buy it. You will only learn something from it. I highly recommend it."
5,Great Guitar for the price,"This is a great version of the Les Paul, while not the best sounding one, definitely a good one for the budget seekers. I wish I could afford a Gibson, but those are just to expensive and I only play for leisure, not in a band, although maybe I will some day if I get the time. The only complaint I have is that the strings tend to slip down a note and I have to constantly keep tuning it through jam sessions. However there have also been times when they stay perfect. Not sure if I'm doing anything wrong, as I'm only a novice player, but the guitar itself is beautiful, sounds great when tuned, and plays like a champ. I also think it's ridiculous that left handed guitars are a little more expensive, but it's only about 30 bucks more than the right handed counter part. Not to bad."
5,Seems to be something fun to do..,"I received this craft in a very timely manner. I haven't tried the product yet, but I had checked it over and it looks like something fun to do with your children"
3,it's a start...,"but seriously, wouldn't it be great to have a CD remaster of the FULL Evita LP by Festival and the full Midney interpretations of Empire Strikes Back instead of just highlights of each?"
2,Not the Best Fender Holders,"These didn't work out for us. The plastic on the clips is rock hard and wouldn't flex enough to work. Also, the opening for the line barely fits a standard fender line. They're cheap and might work for you, but there are better options out there."
2,"Too Little, Too Late","Although I love kinder, I ordered this to accompany a birthday gift for someone and it came later than expected. The main issue I have however is that the picture is deceptive because it gives no sense of the scale of the product- it was far too small for the price it was sold at. The chocolate was nice, but this was an extortion and You could easily buy triple the weight in chocolate for the same price at the store.Slightly disappointing"
3,Kinder Chocolates,"I wouldn't buy this product again, it isn't bad chocolate, but it isn't great chocolate either. Truthfully, Hershey's tastes much better. The box is neat, so, if you're looking for a new type of gift for someone, then it is worth a try because it is German chocolate, especially for a child. A child would enjoy this. A chocolate lover would rather have Wockenfuss chocolates."
5,YUMMMM!,"My aunt used to bring or send me an advent calendar with Kinder chocolates from Germany for Christmas every year when I was a kid. Now I share Kinder chocolates with my kids while we mark the days on our advent calendar. It's a tradition I'm passing on and it would not be the same without these incredible chocolates!! My kids fell in love at first bite just like I did years ago. Kinder is awesome. Order early though, since they took a while to arrive (at least around the Christmas holiday). But they were perfectly packaged and preserved when I received them."
1,Poor packaging,"The product is normally great, but the way it was packaged was a poor display and made the product melt and unetable. Very disapointed and will not purchase from this company again.Was told it was coming UPS but instead it was put in the UPS bag then boxed and sent in the normal post office mail."
2,The Kinder Products are always close to the expiration date.,The Kinder Products are always close to the expiration date. This does not allow to order big quantities and can be dangerous for the health.
5,Wonderful!,"Wow, this product is just what I was hoping it would be! The quality is great, the packaging was perfect, and they shipped really fast! Keep in mind the pieces are small, but they are perfect to satisfy a craving. I just received my box today, and i was so pleased with it I just ordered two more to give as gifts! I recommend these to anyone who enjoys Kinder chocolates."
1,non availability of track samples,Pls amazon provide samples of songs on all your Cds. (Not just this one) I do not purchase any Cd-which I have never heard before unless I can sample a few tracks.Pls do not bypass this request since I am a frequent returning customer; and this most certainly translates into lost sales for Amazon.Thank youR. Alexander
5,Wenlin is the best! Hands down.,"This by far it the best Chinese software I own. Currently I'm a Chinese language student and I use this software daily. I particularly like the fact that I can look up a character and watch the program write it out for me. This has helped a lot in making sure I'm using the correct stroke order.There are a lot of positives to this program. Many of which have already been mentioned in previous reviews. Yes, the price is up there, but the benefits outweigh the costs ten fold. This software has been invaluable to my studies.I'm using it on Vista and have had no problems running it."
4,A step down from Xenos.,"While I enjoyed reading this book very much, it just didn't quite live up to my expectations after reading Xenos. Malleus just didn't seem put together as carefully as Xenos, seeming a bit forced to me the whole way through. Parts of the book were rushed by with hardly any explanation and other parts seemd included just as an attempt to get some immediate action. At the same time some things about this book were better than the first one. The interactions between Eisenhorn and Cherubael, as well as the unfounded(?) accuasations against Eisenhorn by rivals in the Inquisition develop the overall story nicely and begin to change Eisenhorn's character in subtle ways. The final volume of the trilogy is sure to be gratifying.As usual with 40K books, this one is full of action. Death and destruction abound and great battles are fought. Another exciting read by Abnett."
4,Story-Wallah,"I am fascinated by cultures outside the U.S., particularly those of Asian, S. Asian & Middle Eastern countries where ""arranged marriages"" are still the norm & remain so in the 21st century. I wish to understand the pros & cons of these marriages and the empowerment of women in these cultures...where the power may lie ""hidden""...utilized in sublte ways unseen by those looking in from the outside & those within. Well written short stories make for excellent bedtime reading!"
5,Crosstide,"Crosstide is an amazing band that drags you into the emo world. PLaying with bands like JImmy Eat World, and Sparta, this post hardcore band from Portland Oregon is definetly on the rise. The Drumming is spectacular ith great guitar riffs to get you into it."
1,The Product Might Be Good...,...But I wouldn't know since I never received it and neither Amazon nor the company who was supposed to ship it will return my emails. But I sure am glad to have received the offer to review the product.
5,good book on cigars,it was written for the consumer and gives basic information about cigars seems like any othe cigar book but it is still a good read and provides decant information
5,Karajan's 1958 Bruckner 8th w/BPO...,".On the question of Bruckner 8ths:This is Karajan's first (studio recorded) outing with the 8th, and it is spectacular:Karajan/BPO, 1958:I. Allegro moderato [17'05""]II. Scherzo & Trio [16'04""]III. Adagio [27'31""]IV. Finale [26'17""]True Brucknerians will know...Also reissued w/different cover and additional material:Bruckner: Symphony No. 8; Overtures by Mendelssohn, Nicolai, Wagner & Weber.."
2,Surprisingly Lacking In Techniques,"I've owned this DVD watched it and sold it. The DVD has a small songbooklet in it. He plays a song and then more slowly goes through it. There really is no ""technqiques"" in this program. He plays an electric guitar and most fingerstyle masters prefer acoustic. The guitar sound lacks the prescence and depth of an acoustic. He has a kind of emotional distance from his playing that does not appeal to me. I would rather hear someone playing something simple with complete emotional attachement to it than advanced player playing something advanced that is ""cold."" He plays Stever Wonder's Superstition on this but I think Pete Huttlinger's version is better. Again, my main problem with this program is the claim to techniques you will learn from it and there are none."
4,U.S. Benedictine Elders,"This is a very interesting book of 30 elder Benedictine men and women. I knew one of these when I was going to college at his monastery. The interviews are realistic and to the point. The Benedictines tell it as it is or was. One down side of this book is that it only interviewed one brother. For some reason an elder from my monastery was not interviewed, but that is okay. The ones interviewed from other monasteries are great representatives of the Benedictines. If you want to learn some personal Benedictine history read this book. The author, a Benedictine Oblate, has done a great service to us Benedictines. This book is highly recommended. The art work is great too!"
2,Flightless Fiction,"Aptly titled book; it never took off. No magic, no fantasy; just a schlepping misadventure. I skimmed through tedious text just to see if anything interesting would happen. Never did."
1,Not large print,"This Bible measures about 4x6 inches and only 1 inch thick... The type (large print?) measures 7pts... This is NOT large print.I wanted a bible for my sister-in-law who is legaly blind and uses a magnifier to see at all...I feel this is advertised in error!I would have returned it, but it would have cost almost as much as it costs to just toss it!fred"
2,Not Large Print,"I purchased this Bible for the elderly ladies of our organization to use during meetings, I was looking for something they could read easily. This wasn't it. the print was actually smaller than my regular Bible. I think it would have been helpful to be able to Look Inside as you can with many of the regular reading books Amazon has. Iwas very disappointed and sent it back as soon as I opened it."
5,comments on LARGE PRINT,"The reason this Bible is considered ""Large Print"" is in comparison to other COMPACT versions. It is NOT a large print when you compare it to a larger Bible, only to a Compact. There is no way you could get a truly large print into a Bible this size. Anyone who wants a Large print that is truly LARGE is going to have to go to a larger Bible. They do make a Personal Size Giant Print that is not too heavy. Again, it is not false advertising to list this as large print for a COMPACT Bible."
3,not nearly as good as her,"For the professional look of this book, once you open it up, it simply doesn't match. The images inside of Judith's work are not good. Her work is amazing, and most of the images inside this book do not capture her work for what it is in person. It's a shame. However, it's still fabulous that she has a large hardcover out now!"
5,"Warm, intimate....immediately one of my favorite albums.","Don't consider this an academic review--I can't do those. Whether I classify this album as jazz, or more specifically as Brazilian jazz, it ends up in my ""when I wanna feel relaxed and hear very fine music too"" pile. I find this man's playing analogous to that of Bill Evans; it's authentic, and so completely devoid of showiness that a casual listener might enjoy it as pleasant background. Someone who listens a little more closely will be rewarded. Dan McClenaghan, reviewer for ""All About Jazz,"" called it one of the top ten Jazz albums of 2006."
5,One of the best purchases ever at Amazon!,"Loved the sunglasses, were in absolutely perfect condition! In two days I received them, even though I ordered through regular shipping! I am extremely satisfied that I was able to buy them cheaper, receive them early and with no problems. THANK YOU AMAZON! You guys are the best sellers!"
4,very memorable,I saw this movie in 1987. The story has stayed with me for 22 years. It was heartbreaking. I wish people in the U.S. had access to it.
5,One of the hidden gems of world cinema,"Once seen, never forgotten. The set design, the acting, the photography... everything is incredibly poetic and beautifully, sensitively filmed. It was a labor of love for many who were involved, no doubt.For anyone rejected as a teenager, for anyone with any kind of embarrassing health condition, this film is both cathartic and moving.Please see this film if you love world cinema.Forget about the ""controversial"" subject matter. It is woven into the film's core so expertly it is not jarring or ""crazy"".Make up your own mind, but I hope in future years this is seen as a great classic of world cinema."
2,A Large-Scale Musical Dud,"Here is a representative example of CDs aimed at the crossover market, hoping to pull in buyers who are a bit too timid to buy the straight stuff, whether that stuff be classical or jazz. The recordings is a grandiose studio-based project that apparently had a hefty production budget.Epiphany features a sterling lineup of jazz stars--John Abercrombie, Michael Brecker, Peter Erskine, Marc Johnson, Joe Lovano, John Taylor, and Kenny Wheeler--plus not just some bunch of studio fiddlers, but rather the London Symphony Orchestra. Now, I would have paid full price in a minute for a new jazz CD featuring the all-star lineup of A, B, E, J, L, and T, and I have often paid full retail for recordings by the LSO, but doggone it, my experience has always been that when you mix classical and jazz, the end result is usually way less than the sum of its parts, and that is what happens here. There is some nice playing, but overall, the result is a large-scale musical dud. Oh, well..."
3,Used for years,"This is a good general product for schoolwork, etc. I have used them for years as a personal journal. Recently Mead changed the cover and uses a thinner cardboard so they are not as sturdy as they once were. Otherwise they'd recieve an excellent."
5,handy notebooks,"The notebook:The notebook is 100 sheets and it is wide ruled. I find thease handy for everything from a personal notebook to use for school or work. The covers are realatively sturdy, unlike spiral notebooks. The drawback is that you can't rip out pages, because The notebook is bound together by a sturdy thread.All in all this notebook comes in handy for any purpose or any person."
2,The quality of these composition books have gone down.,"Recently, I purchased a few of these composition books since my stash of them has been exhausted. These new composition books use flimsier cardboard and the paper isn't as good. When I compare them to my older books, I realize that these new books are not made in the USA. I don't know if this is the cause of the lower quality or maybe some greater use of recycled papers.In any case, I've decided to move on to Rhodia notebooks. This is unfortunate because I have been using these products since the early 80s when I started kindergarten. Rhodia notebooks are a little bit more expensive, but for my journaling needs are worth it. I believe that Rhodia also uses some recycled paper to create their books.Please bring back the quality to these books."
3,I used to like these Notebooks,"Mead Composition notebooks used to have nice, thick, sturdy, durable covers. Not anymore. Upon receiving my order, I was appalled to find that these notebooks now have a much thinner cover, which means that they will not stand up to the abuse of younger grade school students (Pre-K - K)."
1,terrible service,I ordered and paid for this product and it never came. I haven't even received an e-mail from them explaining why. This is completely unacceptable! I'm never buying from Mead again!
4,Just because everyone else uses it,"An instance of where popular choice overruled my own judgment and my own needs. This is a nice notebook to have for instances where a desk is available, however it is difficult to write in when I am sitting in on meetings without desks. I've gotten used to how to best write in this notebook under the circumstances, though."
1,POOR quality,These journals are very cheap and of poor quality. They are unlike the original journals produced by Mead. You get what you pay for :(
3,Not worth the price.,"This notebook is normal and totally not worth 1.3 dollars. I found exactly the same thing at Walmart for 40 cents/book two days after I ordered it. I wished I hadn't bought this product.If you don't mind the price, this is actually quite a durable product to use."
3,I thought it was quite a bargin...,"I thought it was quite cheap compared with those notebooks sold in school bookstore.However, the same notebook sold in Meijer is only 0.7 each.Anyway, shipping is fast and the notebook is good."
4,Serves its purpose,"I like to doodle and write in my spare time so I try to keep a few of these handy just in case. The paper quality is thin and the overall constuction of the book is kind of flimsy. But the price is pretty low and since I'm not using these to turn in a report or anything like that, it serve it's purpose.It's probably best to use pencil instead of ink since the ink will bleed through the thin paper. I do recommend this item because of the low price but only if you are just going to use it to take notes or do some scribbling, otherwise choose a higher-quality composition book."
1,SO THIN,The pages are really thin; you can see the ink through more than one page. The cover is also kind of thin. If you need a cheap - low quality notebook for nothing important then this is for you.
3,"good price, but poor quality","It is of the worst quality among all the composition notebooks that i have used before!I am not returning them only because of the low price.If you need some notebooks of low price, this is exactly what you need. But if you want something serious, try another one. One can only use one side of each sheet if he/she wants to review his/her writing. Also i recommend the company try to make two sheets into one because in that way we can write on both sides and the quality would improve greatly."
3,Could've gotten it cheaper at Walmart,"The notebook is fine, but when I went to Walmart, I saw the same books for half the price. I think I'm getting too lazy buying things on Amazon and didn't even bother looking somewhere else first."
4,Dave's Tool Shed,"I ordered three of the Mead Composition books because they were a school requirement. There were none to be had here in Kodiak, Alaska, so I ordered them. The notebooks were $5.00 or $6.00 total, and the shipping for almost $17.00!!! I filled out a review that was not very favorable, and within 5 minutes of sending that review, Dave's Tool Shed called me!! They said they would credit my visa card back for the overage in shipping if I would remove the unfavorable review. I removed it. That was almost 3 weeks ago and I have not received any credit on my visa card for the ridiculous shipping charge. I can mail anything up to 3 pounds to ANYWHERE in the United States from Kodiak, Alaska for about $6.00! What's up with the ridiculous shipping charges??!!"
5,"Wonderful product, reliable","I work on a project which requires a lot of documenting and use this type of notebook regularly. The first ones I used in 2001 were Staples brand. The pages have already begun to yellow. Since then I've used Penways, Staples and Mead. The Mead are my favorite. The paper seems a shade brighter, the cover marbling is definitely richer and darker, less warping of the cardboard on the notepaper, and nice wide black binding tape. There is almost never creasing of paper within the pages as I've seen which some other brands. For a less costly item, Mead goes the distance producing a quality product. I search out their brand name for all my office paper products now."
4,A good compilation for both the casual fan & extreme fanatic,"A wonderful and mostly thorough collection of signature themes and musical cues from the Hanna-Barbera library; with top-notch digital remastering and extensive, informative liner notes. One drawback is the omission of the slightly obscure cartoon themes, notably from the 70s and 80s, in lieu of a generous (and obsessive) compilation of 60s ""cartoony"" themes and needle-drops. Most of the adventure/superhero themes from the late 60s onward are noticeably absent as well. But the production values are outstanding and the cartoon sound FXs are the best available, bar none (too bad they're not public domain). Hopefully someone from HB and/or Time-Warner is reading this and would consider additional releases to make this a truly complete package."
5,Classic,"I read this book years ago, and Milton Friedman's recent death reminded me how perfectly it expressed my own view -- that most things work really well when government just leaves them alone and let's us make the choices. I realized that I had to own this book, and find that it has indeed stood the test of time. It's a masterpiece."
5,Free to Choose,Outstanding and ageless. Should be required reading annually by everyone over the age of 16.
3,above my pay grade,"I found this book a little too complex for me. I am an educated engineer and amateur investor. I enjoy thinking, talking, listening about the economy. I found this book to be a little heady for me. That being said, I do think the author makes some excellent points. This book will provoke thought and probably make you wonder, especially now, how we got into this economic mess. I think that if you understand the economy on an intimate level, then this book will by right up your alley."
3,Milton Friedman Doesn't Go Far Enough - Ron Paul is Better,"Milton Friedman does a good job in explaining the problems and flaws of big government, but the solutions he presents in the book only go half way. He tries to compromise and find some middle ground, and that I believe, is his great failure. If one is a true libertarian one needs stronger beliefs and principles. I strongly suggest the reader to read Ron Paul instead.PS: On a separate note I can't understand why the author does not make one single reference to the Austrian School of Economics. His positions are very similar to some classical Austrian Economics authors, but not one reference to Bastiat, Hazlitt, Hayek or Von Mises."
2,Poor Description,"Hardcover book arrived with no dust jacket. This was not included in the description. Bought for cheap so not worth the time to return, but Amazon fulfillment should be better."
5,Why be free?,This is a book that helped shape my life. If you struggle to explain why you prefer freedom in your economic choices rather than letting your government decide for you this a great book. If you desire to understand why governments are not capable of running an economy as well as its citizens this book is for you. Quite simply the Friedmans explain why the principal of freedom applies to economics as well as speech and religion.
5,A must read for everyone,"I read this first in high school, again in college, and I pick it up every now and again to review. This book opened my eyes to how the world works (to steal a phrase from Jude Wanniski). Everyone, no matter your political bent, should read this book from the master. During a recent car trip, I gave it to my 8th grade son, and he said ""How come everyone doesn't read this? It makes so much sense!"" Well said!"
4,Changed my outlook,"I was a Democrat before I read this book. I now lean Libertarian. This book cannot but change at least some of your views on public policy.Having said that, Friedman and the Libertarian Party overstate human rationality. I would also recommendNudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happinessfor how behavioral economists see things."
4,#5 A good basic book before you read Socialism by Ludwig von Mises,"Although milton friedman is a Nobel prize winning economist and one of the most recognizable he is far from a Ludwig von Mises! Now as far as what passes as a modern day economist he is a giant!Regardless, this book is very good in its explanation of the real costs behind the current health care issue and why our government should be on the gold standard instead of printing/borrowing money (Inflation).It is an easy read and very understandable."
4,Excellent but dated,"The ideas expressed are excellent and still applicable, butthe examples feel dated, mostly written at the end of the 70's.An update would be good."
5,Classic and essential.,"After hearing audio clips of Dr. Friedman, watching his short clips on Youtube and eventually watching the entire Free to Choose tv series, I became EXTREMELY eager to read the book. I was not let down one bit. This book is a wealth of knowledge and easy to understand which benefits in preventing manipulation of Dr. Friedman's ideas. Although dated, the era this book was written in is a parallel to today. At some points, it's as if the economic future was already predicted 30 yrs ago. This book and tv series also benefited me greatly in another way as it introduced me to Dr. Thomas Sowell. Genius work by Dr. Milton Friedman!"
3,Very persuasive,"Milton Friedman knws the way to convince you. He does it well even if I still believe his arguments can be refuted. Moreover, he shows an admiration without any limits for A.Smith, which can be upseting. Finally, keep saying that everybody is free to choose seems pretty insane, but that's all the point of his explication."
2,A rehash of laissez faire economics,"I expected more from Milton Friedman. ""Free to Choose"" has been done before and better by Adam Smith. The arguments Friedman presents may be persuasive to the historically naive, but are in fact full of the same fallacies which afflicted Adam Smith. The sad part is that the fallacies in laissez-faire economics have long been addressed by authors from Ricardo to Marx, from Keynes to Galbraith. Unfortunately, Friedman adds nothing new to the debate in this book.This book is simply fuel for the propaganda machine of the new Right. It is right-wing ""pop"" economics for the masses, written in the dawn of Thatcherism."
2,"clear language, but much wishful thinking","This book is well-written and a clear synopsis of conservative economics, but the authors' assertions are often uncanny in their factual distortion: e.g., ""unskilled"" workers would be better off if there were no minimum wage; advertisers do not distort the truth about their products; the Great Crash of '29 was not a failure of the capitalist profit system. I do not recommend this book."
1,Econonomy still far from a science,"Chapter 3: Analysis of a crisis. What does it tell?Again and again, if I read books of economic guru's (as Friedman, Nobel price winner in the Reagan-area), I get the strong feeling that economics is still very far from being a science.If you are interested to see how emotional economists can be, then this book is a good exploration. If you want to learn something about economy, don't spend time with this book."
1,Nonsense,"I don't want to launch into a rant but this is clearly arrant nonsense. Freedom? What about freedom for immigrants to enter the United States unhindered by customs officials, freedom for people to assert their right to equal pay and opportunities, freedom to fight back against racism, sexism and homophobia and freedom not to be ""disappeared"" by mid-seventies Chilean governments - just for having the courage to speak out?"
1,COPY,"look, friedman is obviously plagarizing keynesian principles, why does everyone give such reverance to the man? i dont recommend the book"
3,No Audio Books,"I like this player with one MAJOR exception: it is not supported by Audible.com so you cannot have your audio books on it. All the comparable Sansa players are supported, so I bought this with the expectation of being able to listen to Audible content like any other SanDisk product. However none of the c200 series players are supported and Audible says this is because SanDisk has not provided them with the tech specs necessary. SanDisk was non-responsive to my inquiry as to when they would get this done like their other products - a generic thanks for your inquiry but no info.Bottom line - if you want just music this is a great choice. If you need versatility of also having audio books, buy something else."
2,Ok for the price,"I was highly disappointed with this Sansa MP3 player, although I have owned other models and been happy with those. On the Sandisk Sansa C250, the buttons are frustratingly difficult to push, especially the play, fast forward and rewind buttons.The positives include the MicroSD expansion slot and the battery, which holds an extraordinarily long charge, as well as the built-in FM tuner. I actually bought it with the intent of using the device as an extra data drive if I didn't like the player, so it's not a total waste of money if you buy this and then decide you don't like it.I would have to say that for the price, this little guy packs a good wallop, but I wouldn't buy it for a child with small hands or an older person as their first-ever MP3 player, because the buttons are just too much of a hassle to use easily and intuitively."
2,Good for a while...,"My mom bought this for me for my birthday in 2007. It's been good until about 2 weeks ago. I had my USB setting on Auto Detect which supported folders, and now Auto Detect doesn't work on my computer so I've been forced to use the MSC or whatever which doesn't have folders. I have no problem with transferring music files (except for the mp3 or wav tags at the end of the song titles) but I can't find anything that I recorded so I can transfer it from my mp3 player to my computer. It would be good if MSC was fully covered in the pdf file they have but it's not so it's frustrating. I know a big problem I had also was that I would charge it but it seemed like the battery was uncharged even if I wasn't using it, which was just strange."
2,Not a quality product,"So I got this product, and it worked great for a few months. Then all of a sudden sound stopped coming out of both ear buds, and would only come out of one. No problem I thought, I'll just get a different pair of ear buds. Nope....same issue. I don't know about you, but I don't like listening to things and having the sound in only one ear."
1,Don't Purchase Sansa Products,"I purchased a similar Sansa MP3 Player, the Sansa C140 only to have it break twice in one year. I had it replaced once, free of charge. However, now, Sansa will not respond to my e-mails."
3,It's okay,"The MP3 player is small and very lightweight. I think it's pretty good, but I have two gripes.1. The lighting for the screen is terrible. Most of the time, I have to rotate it at the right angle to be able to see how much volume it has.2. It's difficult to find a skin to protect it.If possible, buy a different MP3 player from Sandisk"
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"Prospective buyers should be aware that if they receive a defective product as I did, they will have a very difficult time getting SanDisk to resolve the problem. The SanDisk Online Customer Service is a tricky maze to navigate, and the questions and challenges from the SanDisk Rep are more intense than Homeland Security. I received my SanDisk Sansa c250 MP3 Player at the beginning of April, and I am still waiting for a replacement installation disk at mid-May. I am unable to get a refund, so my only recourse is Small Claims Court."
3,Broken Again,I got this for Christmas. The left sound channel went out on the first one after a few months. Sandisk sent me a new one but after loading a lot of songs on it the left sound channel went out after just a few hours on the first day of use.Now I an getting the runnaround trying to get this one fixed.
1,I cannot recommend this,It was hard to setup and sync. Battery charging process was weird. Headphones jack was broken in a few weeks.
4,very good,"i'm impressed with this model. its my very 1st mp3 player (unless you count my sony mp3 disc walkman witch i got tired of) and its easy to use. plus i love the photos and voice recorder features. putting in a microSD card was no problem, so i made it up to 4GBs. a few cons, however:-the voice recoder will only use the unit's flash card to store recordings and your computer probably won't be able to play the file (mine won't)-battery life is short, but i bought a portable charger for it and charge it daily regardless if i use it.-the instruction manual is so bad i wouldn't even bother to read it after 5secs. its seriously a joke how non-informative it is on the product.-there is no information about the warranty, witch is confusing."
5,great product,I have really loved this new player. It's a great little player and perfect for use at school. Battery life is good and the sound is good as well. No complaints!
1,Tester,"Sound is great, navigation easy, good quality voice recording.There are two major problems:1. The title and artist name of some songs is not copied to the player. They are simply ""lost"" for some songs, without any detectable reason.2. After copying, recording and deleting files in the player does not correctly release the memory space. The result is that you have less and less space for new songs and recordings. The only way I found to correct the problem is to format and reload the songs, but that re-creates the problem described in #1.I am not sure if a new firmware would resolve it. I opted to return the player."
3,Its okay,this mp3 is okay having problems with using the micro sd card will not read it so i only have the 2 gb it can with also the battery seems to not hold charge to well. other than that its good nice size good sound some what easy to use.
2,Not the best choice,I have had other Sansa MP3 players and loved them. With the kind of work that I do I use these things A LOT! I don't get much use from this player and here is why.1. Battery doesn't last that long when charged and has to be plugged in a USB port to charge. A huge hassle.2. Screen contrast is awfull. If you have any vision issues at all this screen will be almost impossible to see.The buttons are fairly easy to use and the sound is good. But with the other problems I would skip this model and find one a little more user friendly. I still like Sansa just not this one.
1,Not for use outdoors,"The screen on this unit is almost impossible to read outdoors, especially in sunlight. The engineers who designed the blue and white display must never have tried it outdoors. Really a poor design unless you never go outside."
1,"Good Design, Really Bad Sound","I own an iPod but I was looking for a small, lightweight, inexpensive device that supports to-go services for use on bike rides and at the gym. The c250 meets this criteria and the transfer rates were great. I thought I made a great choice...but then I listened to the output. I tried a fleet of headphones but none could make the sound quality even close to adequate. It's a little worse than AM radio quality. I tried to justify it because the design meets my needs, but in the end I need a device that plays music. Perhaps the iPod has spoiled me. I wouldn't mind giving this device to a nephew under twelve or a grandmother. In the end, I owned it for six hours.I ended up going with a Creative Zen V Plus. I think I like the weight and design of this device better, but the Zen offers much better sound quality. Not great, but adequate sound for activities."
1,Waste of money,"Purchasing that player was total waste of money. I didn't have a chance to listen to it even once before it died. My laptop running Windows Vista had trouble recognizing the device (my other Windows XP computer did find it and I was able to upload 2GB of songs). I was obsessed with making my Vista laptop to recognize the device so I tried different suggestions from official sandisk website plus other ones I found on forums. The last solution I tried was uploading firmware from sandisk website. The firmware was loaded, the player reported that it was rebooting itself and ... died. Now I'm able to turn in on and off but display is dead (gray color). I spent hours searching for suggestions on how to bring it back to life but holding all these buttons, connecting/reconnecting to a computer, etc. didn't work. The player has all these great features but it misses one of the most important ones - ability to work."
3,Things I wish I knew,"I bought this on impulse, so far so good. Don't bother downloading anything from Sansa, it doesn't work. The device however, is extremely easy to use with Windows Media Player. Just go to sync and drop and drag what you want to add to you player.Getting the music on the device was so easy I was fooled into a false sense of security. Getting it off wasn't as intuitive. You need pull up the sansa device just like you would hard drive and then delete music from there.The other concern is that in trying to find out how to delete music I saw where a lot of people have had problems with the devices ""freezing up"". I do have one friend that threw his in the garbage because it quit working. This is why I only gave it 3 stars. It works great for me but I'm hearing that's not the case for a whole lotta people.If you buy it good luck, you can find it pretty cheap because it's old and goes on clearance."
4,good player,very good little player. Had to get headphones though because buds were too big and uncomfortable for me.
1,Dissatisfied,"I thought this device could use a 8 GB microSD card. However, Version 2.0 is the only model that has this capacity. Do not purchase this unit if your plans include expansion over 2GBs."
1,Never worked,I have another Sandisk mp3 player and never had any problems.This one is next to impossible to erase the preloaded music and I was never able to download from my computer without error messages. I thought it might be me or my system but had my electronic engineer son try on his with the same results. This player will find it's way to the trash.
1,SanDisk Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black) (Purchased 2008-06),"When I received it, I could not turn it on, so I checked the user menu and fialed to find out how to trouble-shoot. After spent a couple of hours, I decided to quit."
3,I'm not happy with my Sansa,"I bought this Sansa almost a year ago. I was happy with it at first, but I'm beginning to discover it's more of a headache. I'm not a technical wizard, but I'm no slouch either. I found it extremely easy to download the music onto the player, but I have run into trouble. I can't get the music OFF of the player and download new music. I've sat down at my computer three times to try to acomplish this with no success. I end up giving up and walking away. I think I'm going to suck it up and buy an ipod."
2,"Good performance, while it works!","I have had two SanDisk Sansa C250s that have both suffered premature deaths.The first unit lost one of the channels and became a mono channel player.The second unit saw the digital display fail, rendering it useless.Both units died shortly after the expiration of the warranty period.I hope my poor experiences with the c250 were unique."
4,Not bad,Wanted a product that I wouldn't have charging/re-charging issues on a long airplane flights (US to S.Africa- 18+hours). This serves the purpose...J\just have to remember to carry replacement battery.The fact that it's small is a bonus but this can also be a problem as you need a pocket or something to keep it in since it doesn't attach.
4,"VERY GOOD PRODUCT, VERY GOOD PRICE","This MP3 player you get a good device at a very affordable price. Easy to setup, use and maintain. Don't expect it, however, to last years. This is my second one and the past one lasted 1 1/2-2 years. But overall, a great cost efficient device to enjoy your music everywhere."
5,An MP3 Winner,"As a baby boomer I did a great deal of study to determine which MP3 was best for me. I wanted a small unit I could jog with and move about house/yard with my music. It was easy to download songs from WMP10 and I did not want to use iTunes. The 2G size was perfect and I use it nonstop.The included earbuds are comfortable, stable and have great sound. Only complaint was the poor instructions and the navigation was a challenge at first. Even the downloaded user manual left a lot to be desired. Trial and error taught me and now I love it! Don't go ipod hype when this unit does it all. Haven't tried photo yet but glad it is there. Great MP3."
2,I'm returning this player and getting Iaudio U20,"I'm returning this player because-- It only arranges music by id tags. It's really bad if you have music from different sources, and ripped without tags. I'd like to have access using normal folders.-- Almost impossible to create playlists on a computer... I've tried for hours using different scripts.-- No support for international characters in mp3 tagsOther features are pretty good, e.g. you can connect it as a flash drive, read/write, use sd card, resume after off, etc..."
2,Disappointed,"Usually when you purchase an item like this one, you receive a manual or owner's guide that gives detailed instructions on how to use it. This is not the case with the Sansa c250 mp3 player. I have had to hunt for information on the Internet just to get things done. Information that's missing:1. Albums folder: what is its function, how can I populate it?2. MTP mode: the only reason I know about this ""mode"" is because I found out about it on a few sites that have help forums. I don't know what MTP stands for, and the message ""USB connected MTP"" does not show up when I go into Auto-detect mode and then connect the c250 to the PC.3. How about telling the user what MTP nd MSC mean? It would be nice to be told this stuff, especially if you're new to devices like these.4. Where are the instructions for creating playlists?The owner's manual for my toaster oven is the size of a small book in comparison, surely SanDisk could have come up with a more detailed instruction manual."
1,stopped workin after 2 weeks use,this item was delivered on time however it stopped working after 2 weeks-i would like my money back!
2,Not nearly as good as the E200 series,"I got this for my son and ended up keeping it when he liked my E250 better. In fact I thought I had ordered the E250 and later realized I had made a mistake. BUT I LOVE the E250 and since this one was a new model I figured it would be just as good or better. Isn't that why a company changes things? To improve on it? Well they missed on this one.It is much smaller than the E250 and has a smaller screen. It has a flimsy feel compared to the E250 and when you turn it on it takes so long to actually start up, I thought it was not working. It does play though and it will be fine for what I want, I was just so disappointed."
1,<0stars,I purchased this for my husband's birthday but after two days of trying to get it to install on my computer (even with help from tech support via telephone) still no luck. very frustrating.
1,Sansa C250 is JUNK !!! No Battery Charge,"The Sansa C250 deserves ZERO stars (no stars)!!!Just a few months into using the Sansa C250, the battery that came with it stopped holding a charge. I bought a brand new OEM Sandisk battery to replace the original battery (did NOT purchase a no-name battery) and the Sansa C250 NO LONGER charges this brand new battery!!! I have tried charging it using USB and a wall charger and the piece of JUNK no longer charges the battery.What a WASTE of money for the C250 and now I've wasted money buying a brand new battery!DO NO BUY THE Sansa C250 MP3 player.... you will be wasting your money!"
1,Horrid Little Device,This thing has been an absolute mess from the start. Before you buy take a moment to cruse the net for help dealing with these players. Reams and reams of stuff trying various ways to get around some rather glaring firmware issues. This kind of money will buy you something much better.
4,NEED MINOR FIRMWARE UPGRADE; OVERALL NICE,"The Sansa C250 that I bought needed a small firmware update, because it didn't show the USB mode option. I had to connect it using a key combination to show up like a Massive Storage Device.The sound is awesome, and the earbuds are fine.Overall Recommended. For 30 Dollars? 2 GBs? Expansion Slot? Be my guest."
3,mmm???,"First it was very good. about two months later, I lost the left side audio. So I took it back to the store for exchange. I had extra warranty through the store, too. They gave me a new one. After I charged, it still did not have enough juice to operate. I charged again, so far it seemed ok."
3,mp3,"THE ONE THING I DID NOT LIKE IS THAT THE MP3 PLAYER DID NOT COME WITH DIRECTIONS .., IF I HAD KNOWN IT WOULD NOT COME WITH DIRECTIONS I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS ITEM"
2,No Delete function on the mp3 player,"You have to use the Sansa C250 with a computer. You cannot delete a song or a voice recording with the mp3 player, you need to connect to a computer to delete a voice recording which is very annoying."
4,Great for a 10 year old,"I bought this for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it. We were able to easily load music from our computer,we used Windows Explorer and Realplayer...both worked well.The FM tuner is a real plus and being able to put pics on the player is fun. My daughter already has her favorites loaded.As an entry level mp3 it's great. I'm not real thrilled with the USB charging, but again for a beginner it will be fine.The controls are a little small for my hands but perfect for my daughter. We ended up buying headphones, the earbuds were hurting her ears."
2,Review after 2.5 years usage,"I got this Radio / MP3 Media Player in January 2009.After I received it, I filled the 2 GB of space with music.Not long thereafter I noticed that the media player would reset or lock every time it started playing some songs (I suspect WMA files).After that, I stopped using the MP3 Player feature alltogether and only used it's radio and voice recording features.You can also download pictures into it, albeit using a special software which converts the files to a smaller size which can be viewed on the player's screen.Getting the software to work was very tricky, because you have to know which option to select after you plug the player to your PC.The battery stopped working (after being fully charged it discharged completely after 2 minutes) in 2 and a half years.All in all, I'm not too dissatisfied with this product due to its very low price.I would still be satisfied if the battery wouldn't have died on me."
4,Still Ticking,I've been using my Sansa C250 for 4 years now and it still works great. The only downside is that it feels like the Beta VCR in a VHS world. The connector is a different size than iPods so iPod accessories don't work unless they rely on the headphone jack to get the sound.
3,sansa MP3 player,"the player itself is okay, but the instructions are minimal and of little use. it took me several days and a call to the techhelp line to get it to work. and i'm still ironing out the little bugs."
4,Better than Ipod Shuffle,"I bought this product because i wanted something to replace my ipod shuffle. i'd gotten tired of not knowing which song i was listening to, about to listen to, and so on. It is a great little thing and even though i'd read that it doesn't work with windows vista, it certainly does. The only problem i'm having with it is that no matter what cd i upload to it, it won't work. i wish i knew how to fix that problem, but other than that it's great! and i thoroughly enjoy it. =]"
4,Suits me fine!,"After I figured out how to sync, I've found that this little Sansa suits me just fine. I can copy my audio books, and listen to great stories all day long - while I do just about anything!"
3,Good alternative,"The Sansa is a good alternative to the ipod and I am happy with it, but it does not work with Windows Vista."
4,where's the manual??,Well worth the money but the lack of a manual of any kind made it difficult for a first time MP3 player owner to figure things out!
4,good product,"Pros: Light, small, good sound quality and cheap for a 2G player.Cons: I did not like that you can charge it only via USB (but some may prefer it). Also it looks little bit 'cheap'.I think it has a quite high quality/price ratio."
2,Customer Support Very Poor,"We purchased this model for our daughter's 2007 Christmas gift. By summer 2008, it didn't work. She tried working with customer support online but found her emails and inquiries unanswered for weeks at a time. There was always a new suggestion but never a solution. Finally, after months of this run around, I called the company. I was left with the impression they were far more concerned with completing their data base regarding defects than providing the customer with a product that worked. Now, in November, I have a promise of a new product- with warranty. I had to push to get the new product and then had to push harder for a warranty in case the new product was also defective. My daughter(17 yrs)is an emerging consumer and has already written Sansa off her list, I know I have."
2,MicroSoft DRM is a Joke,"This is about to go back to Amazon. I have spent literally hours trying to get this player to work with content downloaded from the New York Public library using OverDrive Media Console. First I needed to upgrade the firmware, whatever Amazon sold me was outdated. Then I had to change some settings (they weren't available in the earlier firmware version). Then... still have problems. I hate Apple's fetishization of COOL but at least iTunes works. Digital music players would NEVER had taken off if the industry needed to rely on Redmond to figure this one out. Total frustration. I think I'm going back to cassettes.Oh, some other stuff. THe player looks much better in the picture than in real life. It's very light and looks to be delicately built. The switches have that cheap feel and the controls are not well located. The screen is OK. I'm too old for this kind of thing and have no trouble reading it."
3,So so,"I bougth two, one is great and beatifull but the other was bad, i can't write on it and i can't read the files on it"
2,"Ok, but hard to use","Bought from Blueproton (via Amazon) got a version 2 of the c250, so sadly it is not yet compatible with the much better Rockbox firmware. [...]The player doesn't have it's own software appears automatically in Vista as a mp3 player (storage device). Making playlists is clunky. It's a lot like a 1st gen MP3 player, I would say skip unless it's selling for ~$25."
3,A little disappointed,"Having purchased a larger Sansa before this, I was expecting this smaller one to be perfect for my younger son. I was very disappointed when I found the ear phone jack will not stay plugged in snug and tight. I am constantly having to take it out and put it back in, then wiggle it, whatever...., to get the connection going and for the sound to come through. I know once I give this to my son he is not going to like having to constantly mess with the ear phone jack to be able to hear his music. Too bad, out other Sansa works great."
4,"Small size, nice display and long battery life :)","I bought the sansa 2GB to replace another player that I had damaged. I wanted a replacement fast without spending too much money, but I knew I would need more storage than 2 GB eventually. The sansa was the perfect answer--because it is expandable via mini SD, you don't overspend for onboard memory, and it has all the features of the trendy players and then some. While the auto load of CD images to accompany each song is kind of cool, I wish it had been easier to opt not to transfer CD images in order to preserve as much space for songs as possible. It does have a very long lasting battery, as I use it for over a week at a time without charging. The size is great, I just wish it came with the armband rather than lanyard and that it came with the AC adapter rather than charge by USB. Totally worth the price, and definitely better than the competitors that charge over $100 for a lousy 2GB. :)"
2,Disappointing MP3 Player,"Bought this item to use it for DRM-protected audio books. Felt a little flimsy and cheap when taken out of the box. After the installation, this supposedly plug and play device caused my computer to keep disconnecting and then reconnecting with the player. Two updates later I was able to transfer some files. Everything worked fine, however not with audio book playback. Unlike an Ipod, the player doesn't remember where I previously paused the current track after turning it back on. Also, when fast forwarding for longer than a minute of the track, the player switches to fast-fast forward, however re-starts the song when the fast-forward button is released!!! Really annoying. So between a cheap feel, poorly written and documented software and everyday problems with the interface I returned the item after 12 hours of trial."
4,Great player especially for the price.,"I bought this for my wife for christmas. she's not really all that techy but even she can figure out how to put her songs on this one. Works super easy with WMP 11, I like the interface better than that of my iPod.Build quality is a little cheap but for the money you can't beat it. It also locked up a couple of times and had to be plugged in in order to reset it. I have updated the firmware (highly recommendable) and haven't had a problem since.For those with charging complaints, the iPod style charger works just fine with the USB cord for this guy."
2,No battery life,"We bought this player for our daughter (in pink) a year ago. She has loved it and taken very good care of it, but now it will not hold more than about a half-hour's charge. It's very frustrating since the player is very good for her otherwise, but having to plug it in to charge it constantly is really too much trouble. Also, the earbuds that came with the player were awful."
1,Almost...,"Equalizer resets whenever changing artist, rendering the player useless because of the headphones I use (Koss UR40, using the equalizer to tone down the heavy bass.) Great player for anyone who doesn't need an equalizer for their headphones."
2,Faulty connection,"I'm about to receive my third replacement Sansa c250 from Sandisk (they get an extra star for having polite, pleasant and helpful customer service reps when you call them, and for replacing each malfunctioning unit easily and with no question) - each one has shorted out at the point where you connect earphones to it and has only played sound in one ear. The first one did this after about six months, the second after four days, the third after a couple of months. I have given up and bought an iPod Nano - while I'm very sorry to lose the FM capability, I'm hoping for more reliability from the iPod. I'll give the Sansa replacement to my husband and wish him better luck than I had... (as for the player itself, aside from the shorting out, I was very happy with its performance)."
4,Best MP3 player I've used,"I've had my c250 for almost a year and it's never given me any trouble at all. I took it on a six-week cross-country bicycle ride last summer and the thing is bomb-proof. I didn't even have the protective case, but I think I may purchase that now. Great battery life too.I can't really explain the negative reviews this player has gotten, my experience has been great. I find the display easy to read and I've had no issues with XP compatibility. I had an iAudio player by Cowon before and it was always freezing up, requiring a firmware update. The Sansa has been trouble free."
4,I like it,This is my first mp3 player and I really like it.The only this I did not like was that when you listen to the FM radio the sound gets loud then quiet and you have to stay still if you want it to stay at the same volume. But overall I recomend this for many people.
2,Don't Expect Much,It works. Software interface is a hassle. Not impressed. Battery charging is lame. Ear buds also useless.
2,disapointed,"THis is ok with space, but what would have been nice is if it came with a recharger, as it happens I tried to ask amazon if they could help me find one but they never got back to me. Rechargable batteries without a recharger is stupid."
2,"Very Very Poor, consider other products","I own one of these and cannot use it for the following reasons :Display cursor is not visible and there arent any settings for contrast, you cannot see the cursor even in dim light and cannot adjust it !VERY VERY obfuscated menu system. This is not a player that is truly mobile in that you will not be able to drive a car, bike or exercise while using this because the menu system is very counter-intuitive and has many unnecessary levels of nesting.No nice features such as speeding up or slowing down playback.I am glad that I didnt actually buy this poorly designed unit but was given as a gift from an apparent enemy.Please note that there are a ton of these for sale used, this should tell you something."
3,don't expect for Christmas!,"I ordered this item November 15. I discovered today, November 26, that even though this item is in stock it will not be shipped until February 1st, 2007. So why does it take nearly three months to mail if it's in stock? The customer service people were no help, I'm sure it's a great prodcut but don't get it here!"
1,Sansa c250 keeps breaking,"The price is right, the features are great, but I'm on my third c250 in the space of about 6 weeks. On the plus side, SanDisk does have customer service and they keep sending replacements. I am very gentle with my stuff and this is an unusual experience for me. I previously had an iPod mini and never had a problem in over a year - now my teenage son has the mini and its still going strong."
2,Poor firmware,"The c200 has some very good features (its replaceable battery is probably the feature I found most attractive). I enjoy listening to recorded books on long journeys, and this activity highlights its major failings:It cannot keep track of its position in a long WMA file. It resets if it is charged, or if you play another audio file.Its fast-forward function hardly qualifies. I have resorted to using a spring clip to hold the FF key depressed for about 20 minutes at a time to resume a story somewhere in the middle(most books are about 10 hours) and the chances of resetting are very high.It really needs a firmware upgrade to address these problems. If all you want to do is listen to music then it is fine as is."
5,I own this & Love it !!,"I bought mine (the red one) at BestBuy .. It was one sale & I did pay less than this.. But its so worth having! I didnt need one with a video player or whatever.. .Just to put some cd's in it & & my spanish stuff to learn.. so I got it..Its wonderful & I highly recommend this to anyone! For yourself, or a gift (unless your a teen & you HAVE to out-do everyone else for your stupid status..lol.)This is perfect! Only 2GB, doesnt hold a whole library of stuff-- but really, are you gonna listen to every CD you own at once, or in 1 day--NO!..Get it.. you'll love it too!"
4,SanDisk MP3 player,This is well worth the money. I wanted sommething to play music and that is what I got. I was new to the whole scene and needed a more detailed manual. The company promptly supplied me with that. Help was very courteous and prompt. I highly recommend SanDisc.
2,"Great MP3 player, but this one was defective.","The c series of Sansa players are pretty great. The native controls are easy to work with and navigate, there is a SD slot for expansion, the player is amall, and the battery lasts a long time. Add Rockbox, and the player gets even better. My player ended up being a dud. After a few months of use, the headphone jack stopped transmitting sound to the left ear. This is not normal, as I have owned a few other sansa players, and they have all been pretty durable, looks like I got a bad one."
1,Never got it to work,"Received this from Blue Proton. They said it was new, but didn't come with cd or proper paperwork, don't know why? Couldn't get it to hold a charge. It would look like it was charging for about a minute, then say it was fully charged. I left it plugged up for at least 10 hours, but it still didn't hold a charge. I tried updating firmware and everything else the help boards suggested. Nothing helped. I tried to contact Blue Proton for suggestions, but got no response at all. I eventually sent it back to Amazon, who took care of it with EXCELLENT customer service. I have 2 other types of Sansas that I love. So I suppose this was just a bad one or maybe even a bad model. It seemed a bit cheap when I got it. I eventually bought a Sansa Clip directly from Amazon and have been very pleased with it."
1,The worst!,"I picked up the Sansa c250 for $12 and I paid too much for it. It is one of those pieces of technology that, instead of working for you, makes you work for it. Most of my complaints are against the OS, but the physical build was nothing to brag about. The volume reset to halfway everytime I powered it on, so my ears got blasted if I wasn't paying attention. The display is impossible to read in sunlight. The software, however, is what made me finally smash the unit on the floor. It was a constant struggle to get it to do what I wanted. There's no way to play files by directory, so you have to make sure all your tags are correct. I tried installing Rockbox, and that was, if possible, even worse. I will never buy another Sansa. I'll stick with iRiver."
2,Guaranteed Headache,The display resolution and contrast on this unit is so poor you can't read or navigate the menus. There are no controls for contrast and the choice of colors for the selection and battery level are virtually unreadable in sunlight or in darkness. Functionally the player works fine but I don't recommend this unit because of the unreadable display.
2,"Decent device, spoiled by stupid software engineering","This is a reasonably decent device, spoiled by a lousy interface.When you try to navigate in album mode, or in any other mode other than 'songs', it mixes up the album order. I have my mp3 albums named so that when you sort the songs in alphabetical order, the songs will be in the correct order within the album.The Sansa device sorts the songs by the write time of the song to the player, making it impossible to play an album in the correct order. Compared to my iRiver player, this is junk."
4,Works great,"Easy to use, sounds great. My only complaint is that the screen is sometimes hard to read outside in the sunlight."
2,Music Management Is Disappointing,"I bought this unit for my 10 year old so she would have something simple to use. Unfortunatley it is too simple. The music management is terrible. It seems to put songs and albums where it wants to, and some things will show up on the player when it is connected to the computer, but will not be there when you look for it on the player.The other issue I have it even the lowest volume setting is too loud, especially for a child.I guess in hind site I should have loved her more and purchased the Nano."
1,2 of them broke.,"I bought two of these and I actually thought they were a pretty good buy for the money. However, after about 2 - 3 weeks, they both started to get intermittent connection to the ear phones. And it is the ear phones as all earphones had the same problem. I googled it and apparently I'm not the only one that has the same problem. They are cheap for a reason.So to sum it up,The bad.- earphone connection prone to failure- bad contrast on the display, hard to see- Sound quality is mediocre. I bought an iPod, wow what a difference in sound quality.The good.-cheap-looks cool-cheap"
1,too big,didnt like it so i took the vibrating apart and threw away the enormous flicker...this thing was designed for a pornstar or black dude. teo thumbs down
4,decent product,"This product is well made,(better than I expected)and works well. I would prefer one aaa size battery rather than the three button batteries that it comes with. There was a second set of button batteries included and you can find replacement batteries at fairly reasonable prices on the internet. Definitely worth the money and fun to use! We are satisfied with this product."
1,gigantic and cheap,"Its way bigger than you think it is based on the picture. I have what I consider to be a fat d*ck, not compaired to this. My next thought was to just give it to my wife to put on one of her toys, again too big. We thought maybe it went under the ballsack too. While a tight fit, it did go, placed back in the drawer for later use, it was found broke only 6 hrs later (left on the toy). Fine. Tried use as a small linger like pleasure device. Loud OMG, rattle city and wasn't very reliable to function. Being new it shouldn't cut out any. It received 45 seconds of use and was trashed. Unless you're pack'n the circumferance of a toilet roll (tight mind you, that is the point of a c ring), don't bother."
2,Ugh just no!,This just doesn't hit it-used it a couple times and now it's at the bottom of the toy box where it's going to stay - worthless!
2,California exotics clit flicker,I received this product quickly. It's just ok. Not what i thought it would be like.I don't use a lot of products like this. so i am new at this.
3,I Finally Found Emotion from Samantha Sang!!!,"I have been searching for this song for a while, & I finally found it, the rest of the songs really don't fit my taste, but I was very happy to have this one song from it's original artist."
3,Not the best in the series...,"...but it was the last one I needed to complete my collection. For me, ""Save All Your Kisses For Me"" and ""Street Corner Serenade"" are the highlights."
2,Rhino Loses Steam Here,"This is the weakest volume in the 25-volume set. Rhino either lost their enthusiasm for the project on this one or ran out of money to purchase song rights. Several hits from this era would have added weight to this volume, and would have matched the earlier spirit of the project. How about ""Reminiscing"" by Little River Band? ""Children of the Sun"" by Billy Thorpe? And, a song that is referred to numerous times in liner notes of previous volumes -- ""Baker Street"" by Gerry Rafferty? Rhino rallies a bit in Vol. 25, but this one is a stinker. Most of these songs were marginal hits, and you'll understand why when you hear them."
2,The Decline of Pop Hits,"Compare this collection of late 70's hits with the collections of HAVE A NICE DAY from the early to mid-70's. This CD is basically whatever they had left to pick from. The early 70's were no doubt, rich in producing a multitude of the best melodies, performances and songs that still last today. I was "" lucky "" to find this late volume recently , and cheaply at a longtime record store that is still open for business. I bought it to have as part of the series, even though it's weak, and only contains a few big hits - EMOTION, FEELS SO GOOD, a few others. It's a reflection of how bad late 70's pop got. Pseudo-disco, fluff, schmaltz and schlock make up the bulk of the tunes on here. Thank goodness that pop music turned the corner in the 80's, as this volume is loaded with artists trying to come up with a good song, and failing miserably."
1,This was the lamest collection in the series.,"I came of age in the 70's, and loved the music. I never even heard of most of these songs! The series has been uneven, but on the whole, I never regretted buying any of them except this one, and I have the whole set."
2,There are better volumes..,"but this one isnt all that bad, it has rarities in it. ""emotion"" by samantha sang is one of them. She vanished after that effort (which was produced by the BeeGees) but what a hit it was. I guess if you are going to soak the money into the complete series, you need this volume."
3,"The worst CD in the series, but still essential","Yes, this CD is the bummer of the series of 25, but ""Thank You For Being A Friend"" and ""Did You Boogie"" pull it out of the fire and make it worth buying."
4,Excelente maletin,"El Wii entra prefecto y muy seguro, el sensor IR tiene su propio lugar espacio adecuado para controles y cargador + variedad suficientes de juegos que podras llevar a todas partes con este maletin. Ademas el material es de muy buena calidad"
4,Tight Fit,"Overall I thought that the product was fine. It was a very tight fit though. I put my 17"" laptop and my WII console in the pack along with my games, two wiimotes, and one classic controller... it was a very tight fit. I think maybe they should have added a couple of more inches of space. When im not traveling across state with my wii and laptop I use it as a backpack for my books and laptop. To give u an idea i put my math book, my laptop, and two three ring binders. Dont expect to fit anything else in it."
4,Does It's Job,Overall the bag does what it is supposed to. It keeps the Wii safe during travel and I like that you can play it while it is still in the case. The only thing I wish it had was a place to put the sensor bar and controllers that kept them from moving around so much.
5,worth every penny,Great case it is very well made I think it will last a long time. Everything fits great and keeps it all togeather GOOD DEAL!!!
3,Good case - but less expensive elsewhere,"I love this case - it's set up so you can leave the console in the case and use it right from there. However, I bought the exact case over 2 years ago from amazon.com for $29.99, so this seller has it way overpriced."
4,"Solid, no frills case-- priced about right","The review title pretty much says it all. At $19.99 it'd be a no-brainer, so perhaps it's a little on the expensive side, but the quality is decent enough."
5,G-Pak Console Organizer Case,"This is an excellent travel case for the wii console. It holds 4 controllers, 4 nunchuks, all cords, the console, the manuals, several games, memory cards. You can play the console inside the case which makes it nice in the car. Rigid construction, quality zippers, comfortable carry strap."
2,Didn't moisturize my lips,"I tried all three chapsticks, and none of them provided relief from my chapped lips. They all had a cool tingling sensation, but after that subsided, my lips burned because they were still chapped. They also had a nice flavor to them, but I think these are more of protection against chapped lips and not relief for chapped lips."
2,No Support & Product Marginal,"I've got about 300 cassettes that I wanted to convert.The installation is fairly straightforward. No problems there.Connections APPEAR to be straightforward, but you have NO idea, and NO way to check.After about four hours of screwing around trying to get this to work, I was finally able to start recording. At least I thought. I kept doing various things. Cassettes APPEARED to be recorded. When I tried to make a CD I got nothing. A few more hours. Finally came to the realization that if I saved the files as WAV files, I got nothing. If I saved the files as MP3 files, everything was fine. Now I get to covert the files from MP3 files to WAV files. Not an insurmountable task, but . . .Was NEVER able to get onto their website.I'm going to keep it, but I'd wait for something else if I was in the market."
1,VERY POOR DESIGN OF INTERFACES,"I have ""installed"" this item and it sits here and collects dust due to the buggy , immature install design, you have to hook up cables to parallel and serial ports and if you don't have them then ""simply"" add them.. crap , Should be redesigned as a simple external box with usp2 interface.. this is a lousy product. michael Railey Dallas, tx."
2,Poor sound quality,"I was able to install the device and get it working without any problems. I converted some pre-recorded tapes. The sound quality of the mp3 file was poor. It sounded worse than the pre-recorded tapes, which had pretty good sound quality. Some of the mp3 files the device made had patches of garbled playback. Most of the mp3 files it made had this problem. I do not recommed this device if you want quality mp3 files from your converted tapes."
1,No Tech Support,"Easy to install as are all pci devices that simply go in a bay. No innovation there. I have a few ""decades"" under my belt working with pc's but I have yet to get the sound working correctly. I even spent more money and bought a pci board the manufacturer said was needed (but is not stated as needed on the advertisements or on the box anywhere). I have sent quite a few e mails to their support but only received one reply. In this reply, they were proud to announce that the usb version was coming out in several months. Believe it or not, this did not fix my current sound problems. Their support has basically totally ignored me and is totally nonexistent. I would not advise anyone to buy this device. Mine is being packed up and is going back."
4,Fantastic Hardware For A PC Entusiast,"I have a Pusdeck 2c for a few months now and am loving it.Pro's: Great for converting cassettes to MP3 format. Automatically detects gaps between tracks. Autoreverse. User-friendly software.Con's: PlusDeck's user-manual is quite unclear, and has many mistakes. Installation of hardware can be a little tricky for PC amatuers. They could have made the unit look a little more sleek. Soundcard provided with the unit can cause minor problems with PC's onboard soundcard."
4,PC Tape Deck,"I just purchased the Plusdeck2c PC Cassette Desk to convert my old cassettes to MP3 files for further transfer to CD's. The unit works great abit trying to see the exact position of the tapes while in a fast forward or reverse mode leaves a lot to be desired. It looses it's place and you have to do some guess work to find out where the tape is actualy at, but that is only a minor problem otherwise it works great."
2,What a let down,"I purchased this in Jan 08. When I pulled it out of the box and installed it the cassette door was broken and slid down so I couldn't insert any cassette. That took at least 2 hours with tweezers to pull it out. After reading through the manuel (finding 4 spelling mistakes) I got it working and it was great. By July I was no longer able to use for fear of destroying my cassettes. At first it bunched the tape inside. It was easy to get the tape out this time. I thought it might have been just a freak occurrence, so I tried it again. It worked fine. A couple of cassettes later I tried it with a hard to find cassette. That was a mistake! It bunch up the tape so bad it took a couple of hours to finally get it freed just to find out it also broke the tape. It has sat unused for 3 months. I tried to email the company and still have not heard from them. Calling is out of the question because the phone number is for the company in Korea."
4,Works well but difficult to install,This product is great but I had to get a computer person and even he had a little trouble with the installation. You can't have dial up interent with it as it uses the port. Make sure that you have all the cables. The seller was very supportive and available to answer questions.
2,Not 83% cotton!,"I just bought 6 pairs of these socks from Amazon, because the 'Product Review' said that they were 83% cotton. I like cotton socks best because they keep my feet drier. So I look at the content label, and they're really NOT much cotton, they're only 47% cotton, 35% acrylic, and some other stuff. I don't like anything made out of acrylic or polyester.Hey please Amazon, try to be more accurate about your product reviews! If I can't trust your reviews, then I'll have to go back to driving to a regular store for apparel, and trusting your company no longer."
1,Tshirt came with hole in it!!!,"I ordered this product, and when it arrived, it had a hole in the front right under the logo. I was very disappointed because it was not exactly cheap for a t-shirt. Beware."
2,This is NOT a classic AC/DC shirt,"If you were hoping for the classic burnt orange AC/DC front, you will be disappointed. This one has letters that are too big, and a fluorescent yellow tinge! What is this, a WHAM t-shirt??? It took me half a second to realize this is a poor imitation of what it should look like. Buy somewhere else."
5,Don't Pass This Up!,"This is the sound of three young friends doing what they loved to do - their feelings of excitement and joy can clearly be heard in their voices.The harmonies in this album are pristine, creative and unique. Leads are shared and the three perform as a group in the same vein as highlighted in the albums ""Where Did Our Love Go"", ""More Hits By The Supremes"" and ""The Supremes Sing Holland-Dozier-Holland"" - when the group (Mary, Flo and Diane) was truly a ""group"" in every sense of the word!"
4,One Of A Kind,This is the Supremes as you've never heard them - singing standards. A treasure of classics.
1,Disappointing!,"Of all the things I've ordered from Amazon this cd has to be the most disappointing. I realized it was the Supremes singing old standards, but I thought they would give the songs a little bit of a Supreme twist. To me the songs were slow, the vocals watery and I'm surpised that the Supremes could sound so bad. I really bought the CD because I wanted the song ""Somewhere"" which although it was played on the radio (in my teens)it was never released. The song held lots of memories for me, but the song on this CD sounded nothing at all like the version that was played on the radio in 1966. I would love to find a recording of ""Somewhere"" that Diana Ross sang by herself without the 3 piece harmony (but still with the Supremes), but I guess I'll never find it. I was looking forward to getting this CD, but I'll probably never play it.There's a Place for Us"
1,Not So Good,After listening to this CD I understand why Motown never released it. It was out of Diana's range at the time.. I love Diana Ross but this IS NOT Diana at her best!!
3,HP Digital Camera Accessory pkg - good,"It was a good value for the money, the re-chargeable batteries that are part of the kit are better than more expensive batteries bought at a camera retailer."
2,minnesota,I love Mary Hunt's books but I did not learn anything new from this dvd. I would suggest her books rather than this dvd.Minnesota
2,Annoying little helicopter learns to dance!,"I got several Jay Jay videos from the library where I work, expecting a cute show for my kids. Instead, I found that they are all pretty stupid! Some of the episodes try to teach a good lesson, but the plotlines are misguided and lame.On this tape, Herky the helicopter is afraid of being ridiculed by the airplanes and so teaches himself to dance in private. This and other dumb stories make this a barely watchable video by kids and adults alike."
3,VERY BASIC... more for kids,"I purchased these as well as another ASL card combo and I liked the others better. This one is DEFINITELY for kids w/ childish pictures. Would only recommend if you are working on Signing with a child. Otherwise, purchase a more mature cards with more mature conversation:)"
3,For Glavine Fans- That's about it,"I must reveal I'm a life long Braves fan. I've rooted for and respected Tommy Glavine since his rookie season pitching for 7,000 people at Fulton County stadium. I enjoyed this book just as I have enjoyed watching Glavine's career.However, the book doesn't reveal much insight into the Braves or the game of baseball-just Tommy Glavine. It reads like a book rushed to print in order to capitalize on the 1995 World Series MVPship of Glavine; while the marketability of Glavine was high. Its a standard baseball auto/biography. The 3 stars isn't to belittle this book: its an average book getting an average rating."
5,A great book for any Brave fan!!,"Comming from a 14 year old Brave Fan, I think this book is GREAT!! I have read this book over and over again, it's just that good!. None But The Braves is by Tom Glavine, a left handed pitcher for the Braves. It tells about his life, family, minor league days, his Major League career and the 1995 World Series(which Atlanta won!). I think this is a great book for any Braves fan, young or old."
5,Super band in the super package,"You got live audio cd, and also you got dvd for live video PLUS over an hour of documentary of this great electronic group. Worth the money? are you kidding me? If you love the band, you'll love this pack."
5,RADIO SOULWAX,"I highly recommend this documentary. It is well made, and really interesting. I usually feel let down when a music documentary ends, because I feel like it is being cut short, but I think this is perfect. It is definitely worth checking out."
3,Dark comedy?,Except for the physical abuse the husband inflicted on the wife and daughter... this movie isn't what i would call a horror movie..I laughed and shook my head at most scenes because i found it absolutely dumb. Were we to assume that the baby the daughter was carrying belong to her father? was he molesting her?... why did they leave the viewer (ME)guessing about that ???I'm giving it 3 stars because it did keep me entertained.. I'm still on the search for the perfect horror movie.
2,Fun For the Whole Family,"Or what's left of the family after The Woman gets done with it. If you are in the mood for a twisted gore fest, or are just genuinely depraved, rent this. I'd write more, but I just finished watching and I need a long hot shower and a large vodka."
3,"Wow, that was one messed up movie","Really don't know what else to say about this film. The bad guys definately get what they deserve, but this is one seriously wigged out movie."
2,WHAT!?,I can't believe this movie was even written. As I was watching it I wondered if the dad raped the daughter and got her pregnant. This is the WORST movie EVER. The dad deserved to die and I believe the mom deserved what she got because she just let it happen. What's worse then having one woman in the shed it turned out that there was another human in the barn treated like a dog.You want some advice DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE EVER!!!! there are better movies then this.
1,Great purchase for people that hate women,"It has no message, no underlying theme that can be at all redeeming, really nothing of value. That is unless you count the wanton display of woman hating and abuse as something of value, then you'll be rolling in good will toward cast and crew of ""The Woman"". If that's your thing, you'll probably be pants-shittingly happy with your purchase. If you have an iota of a human soul, you'll not only hate yourself for purchasing (not to mention actually *watching*) this tripe, but you'll likely hate the rest of your human brethren as well."
5,Disturbing,"Wow! Having loved the book I couldn't wait to see if the movie would be true to the story line. It definitely was and then some! I actually feel dirty after watching the film, significantly disturbed by the images I witnessed. The perfect horror movie full of delightful twists, turns and secrets. I will say, the gorey parts were a little hokey, more rubbery than sinewy but that is my only complaint. Highly recommend for the horror buffs out there like me!"
3,Woman DVD review,"For all its hype I am a little disappointed in it. They spent WAY too much time away from the main character the feral Woman and yammering on about the screwed up family. I honestly felt they needed to add more gore and action to the movie. I cannot believe some idiot at the film festival got upset? I could tell McKee was backing way off on the gore scenes. No heads, arms, or legs cut off at all. I wish the Woman would have caused even more havoc at the end. I think Polyanna McIntosh does a GREAT job playing this character. I would have had her start picking up more English words as the show went along. If they do have another movie in this series lets show more of the Woman less of some lame family. McKee stop hiding all the gore scenes."
1,Worst movie i've ever seen,This movie is the worst I have ever seen. I don't even know what I should say cause it is so bad and twisted I've have never not like a movie this bad. If you got a weak stomach or little kids around or not into cannibalism I don't suggest getting it.
2,Meh.,"I love horror movies. This one was listed in some top 100 horror movies of all time list, so I snatched it up. Unfortunately It's 80 minutes of obnoxious frustrating lead in topped off by 10 minutes of a cool horror movie. Not one to own."
5,Excellent Movie!!!,This movie was great. It started off kinda slow but it lived up to it's exceptations!!! It had me on the edge of my seat!!!
3,Good flick,It was a decent horror suspense flick with an interesting twist at the end of the movie that brought theories to a creepy end.
3,The Woman,I finally got the chance to watch THE WOMAN...ohhh mannn. Talk about crazy and nuts with a slight side cool. If you're into 'WTF flicks'...THE WOMAN is worth watching.
2,This may be your movie,"You will love this movie if you are a man hating lesbian. In typical Hollywood style of the politically correct 2000s, the males are low brow stupid white thrash and the women are knights in shinning armor that can do no wrong. Go strong women. Oh yea, This movie is not scary except for the wild woman's boobs."
3,The Woman,"Imagine if Quentin Tarantino decided to remake the 1987 comedy Walk Like a Man as a modern grindhouse thriller; you'd basically have the recipe for The Woman. One of the best horror films I saw in 2011, The Woman centers around a lawyer named Christopher Cleek, who discovers a feral woman living in the woods, captures her, and brings her home to his family in order to civilize her for modern society. Of course, the woman turns out to be more than Christopher bargained for, and before long, the family is forced to defend themselves against an unfamiliar enemy with the upper hand. Despite its familiar explorations of gender and human nature, The Woman is an ambitious, unabashedly strange, and ultimately effective thriller that builds tension toward a brutal, no-holds-barred climax."
3,The Girl Next Door meets Misery.,"A man, with a prominent career, lives out in the country with his family. One day while he's hunting, he finds an uncivilized wild woman. He captures her and locks her up in his basement. He is controlling and abusive to everyone. He forces his family to care for the wild woman. His demands, thoughts, and actions aren't rational. There are moments of torture, abuse, and gore throughout this movie. The acting and camerawork were actually of good quality. I just personally prefer horror movies that are mostly psychological or paranormal. If you prefer gore or Quentin Tarantino type films, you might rate this one a 4 or 5 star."
3,She loved it to death........,"We got this for my dachshund as a Christmas present. I can say with certainty that it did not make it past the first 30 mins after she unwrapped it. Well, the squeaker that is. We still have the pig toy, just had to take out the ""fun"" part that she destroyed. I thought it would withstand a little chewing, guess my dachshund chewed it a little too hard. Cute concept, just not for a dog like mine that has the instinct to kill the squeaker. At least we could salvage the body!"
3,Very Small,"This toy was a lot smaller than I expected. Luckily the size isn't a choking hazard for my dogs size (he's a standard size American Eskimo), but any smaller this toy would be a problem. I gave this three stars because my dog really likes this toy for some reason and has been dragging it around everywhere."
3,Cute but smaller than I expected (didn't read dimesions when ordering),My dogs pulled out the removable sound assembly and had more fun with that listening to the oinks - they chewed it to destruction.
5,cute,I bought this as a present for my nieces dog. They do enjoy it together and it made the perfect (lower priced) gift.
1,Do not waste your time or money,"People, rarely do I leave a review, but I feel obligated to leave one now. This item is crap. Do NOT waste your time or money. If it were worth my time and effort, I would return this defective item for a full refund. But for $10 - I am not going to full with it. Instead, I will leave this review for you to think about. I received this item for a new puppy but was misled into thinking it was more than one animal. That was the first problem. The second - the item that arrived was broken. That's right - the darn pig did not even ""pip"", squeak, or grunt. Third - the pig is so incredibly tiny that it is laughable. We actually laughed when we realized we had been duped.Save yourself the trouble and find something else. Unless you want a good laugh...."
2,Doesn't do what the description says,"I read the description and reviews and they said that the toy makes a grunting noise when thrown... and reading this I got 2; one for my pup and one for a friend who just got a pup. To my disappointment neither of the toys made any noise when thrown. They would only grunt when specifically pressed at a certain spot. Also, the toy is very small... smaller than an average person's palm... the make doesnt look too good either... i like the color and the texture but thats it. I usually have good things to say about Kyjen toys but this one is not worth the $$!"
5,Enjoyable Movie,I saw this movie on AMC and knew I had to have it. Thank goodness I found it on Amazon.com! This movie is a classic full of color and interesting characters.
1,A Big Disappoint,"I'm probably the biggest fan of Luis Royo, and was very excited to see a best of book.Why am I disappointed with this book? Because almost all of the images here are zoomed and extremely cropped. the zoomed pics show more detail than avaialable in Royo's other books, but no way does this make up for the what's missing from the complete pieces. Its more of a highlights of Royo than a true best of.To add even more salt to the wound, this book contains alot of sketches of the final pieces, found in conceptions I & II.Those Should of been excluded since theres no way they could be considered ""best of"".If anyone is interested in buying this book I recommend you see it in person first. It's really a shame to see his art so edited and clipped. If not for the 2 or 3 new images found only in this book I would return it or sell it.If youre looking for a good collection of the best of Royo, for the same price as this book, you could get his 3 first books Women, Malefic, & Secrets."
3,Personalized books are a great gift!,"I purchased the Personalized God Loves Me Children's Book for my niece's 8th birthday. Although the storyline was not what I had expected, she was thrilled that her name was included throughout the story!"
4,Valuable info..,This isn't Mark's best work but it's good. Predominatly Jewish/Isreal latter-day info here. This is not for the very new believer as the outline is intense.
4,"A great, reliable timer",This timer works just fine. It is replacing the same model that recently failed... after 10 YEARS!! We use this timer between 4-6 hours every night in the spring and summer months for our whole house fan.My only gripe and reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I was shipped a silver face timer rather than the ivory timer as pictured. Fortunately I have the old ivory face so no real harm.
1,Has already failed.,"What a co-incidence that you sent this request for a review. I received the email on Sunday, Aug. 28th, 2011; and the timer had failed the night before. We use it to control an attic fan that is timed to shut off at approximately 3:00AM. The fan ran all night long, and the timer dial was still in the same place it was originally set.Ain't China great?"
3,Too large for utility box,"The unit is slightly larger that prior models from Intermatic and does not fit well in the smaller size switch utility boxes. The unit seems to be larger than necessary. I got it in the utility box by tapping it in gently. The face plate will not mount flush with wall because of the timers mounting tabs...specifically the tab which has a threaded hole in it and cannot be broken off. The older units had metal face places with curved edges which gave space behind the face plate which accomodated slight protrusions from the timer. Overall, not a very thoughtful physical design, but it does work as intended."
2,Not reliable,"Item worked well for 2 months last summer and a couple of weeks this summer, but you can't turn it past 2 hours anymore. Something inside the switch is binding. For the cost, it should be more reliable.."
2,"Ok, helps with ideas and organization","I felt that this book had some helpful hints but some of it was complete with ""fillers."" I definately needed more space for writing and calendars, and easy to access tabs etc. I ended up using another binder that was given to me that included spots for budeting and receipts, tabs, calendars and all the works. This was a good book for a simple smaller wedding but definately not for the ultimately organized as it lacks room all together. I ended up giving this book to another bride, unused because there simply wasn't enough room and easy to access information or pockets for business cards and things."
4,Pretty Darn Informative,"Touched on it all. Definitely a How To with details. It answered many questions not just for one kind of bride but for brides of all kinds. I thought the least helpful were the personal accounts, more touchy feely than helpful. Their website is the best and this does supplement the website with more detail."
2,Meh,"Sort of stodgy and corporate, but attempts to present itself as hip and knowing. Unfortunately this book tries too hard, contains a lot of filler, and doesn't have a ton of really practical advice. Most of the info was fairly obvious and straightforward, and a lot of it can be found at their website. I don't find myself reaching for it at all, and instead have turned to the Bridal Bargains book by Field and Field, which is much more useful."
4,Great Engagement Gift,I received this item as a gift when I was engaged about a year and a half ago. I used it all the time so when I friend of mine recently became engaged I got one for her.
3,Ok,"The book is okay. I've purchased some others that I liked more. I don't regret buying it, but it wasn't super helpful either."
1,"Poorly organized, outdated information","This book looks comprehensive because it covers a lot of topics, but it's so hard to find anything because it's so randomly put together. It would be great to have details structured on a timeline, but that's not how the authors wrote this. Details on searching for a venue don't appear until page 145 -- well after all the details on whether or not to have a receiving line at the reception. It claims to have advice, ideas and relief, but there isn't much of any of those topics. It's superficial and overwritten, and incredibly unhelpful. It also seems like it was written in the mid-90s, with pictures from 15 years ago as well."
4,A great book to start with,I just started planning my wedding and found this book extremely helpful. It has all the details and steps of a wedding and great ideas for different options for each of them. For every part of the wedding planning I find my self referring to the book to see what exactly I am supposed to do and how early before the wedding I should do it. It also has some creative ideas to reduce costs. The book does not have very helpful checklists and I am using another book for that.
3,"Some Good Advice, Mostly Hype","When my fiancee and I first started planning our wedding, we heard about this book and purchased a copy because of its popularity and mention in magazines and elsewhere. While there is some good advice, it's not the must-have some people say and it's heavily tied into the web site too, which is just more of a time drain. I think much of the material could be condensed into fewer pages and more focused advice. You won't regret buying it, but nor will it make your planning much easier IMO."
2,Take it or Leave it...,"In my opinion, it isn't worth paying for this book--all the same information is available, for free, at their website. I bought a ton of wedding books--and never used them becaue I had all I needed online for free. If you aren't a computer-y person, then go for it...but if you know how to browse websites, save your money for the centerpieces, photography, or other wedding detail."
4,A little too Silly but hey look at the title!,"This album is good, for what it is..... The only song it was missing was Daddy's Song...... If u have a kid this may be perfect for getting them started on something great :) Buy with confidence just dont expect too much, it isn't the ""White Album"" just take it for what it is and u wont be disappointed."
5,"Run, don't walk, to your nearest used book store...!","A heart-rending tale of separated lovers, beautifully told. Especially timely read in light of the political turmoil in the current world scene. One can easily imagine this story being replayed time and again, as refugees flee war-torn countries, leaving behind family members who, through no personal fault, may never see their loved ones again. A story of courage, of perserverence. Find time to read it all at once if you can - it is almost impossible to put it down!"
4,i know who did the songs,"some songs like #3,5,6, and 7 were done by britney spears, patti labelle did #1,2. dione warwick did a couple and i cant tell u who did the rest"
1,STOP!!!,Who ever keeps doing these Tribute cd's seriously needs to stop. It's not funny. The singers are horrible. It's a disgrace to the artist. Nobody asked for this!
3,It's okay,"It's a cute toy and clearly durable. But it doesn't really keep my baby's interest for more than a few seconds. He doesn't even seem interested in teething on it. He was 8 months old when I bought it for him, if that makes any difference. We've had it for two months and it mostly just sits there and looks cute."
5,Love Haba,"My four month old is just starting to grip onto toys and he likes to hold his Caterpillar. Most of all he seems to enjoy looking at the little face. I love Haba toys and think you can't go wrong with a Haba purchase. The Caterpillar is cute, colorful, and easy to grasp (at least the ring is easy for him to grasp at this point)."
3,Not quite the original album,"The cornerstone track, ""Youngblood (Livin' In The Streets)"", has been replaced by the edited version for this downloadable album. Originally it clocked in at 10:43 and was the highlight of the album. As such, what you get here is already available on most War compilations. This was also done with ""Deliver the Word"", where the original extended album version of ""Gypsy Man"" is replaced for download by the single version commonly available on most of War's best of compilations. I can only imagine that eliminating points of differentiation would hurt sales.The rest of the album might appeal to samplers who want to grab snippets of dialogue; many of the shorter tracks amount to dialogue supported by either percussion or music. If you're looking to download key tracks, check out ""Keep On Doin'""."
3,very cute but the sound box didn't work,bought for a friend as a joke. would not recommend this as a dog toy but it would be cute for a kid who likes donkeys
2,It is cute........but not a good dog toy.,This is very cute. My teenage daughter who likes eeyore from Winnie the Pooh likes this. I find it hard to believe that this would last very long as a dog toy. Our dog is very gentle with stuffed animals and I didn't even give this to her for fear that it would last only a couple of minutes.
2,cheaply made,"This is not worth the cost, it does make sounds but if you have a chewer don't get this. My dog is a larger dog but she is gentle with her toys now that she is older so the flimsiness of this is not so much an issue."
3,It's okay,"It's a great toy but does not last long. My dogs love it. However, after few times, they destroyed the voice part."
5,LOVED IT!!,I'v been waiting for a new dogs toys to come out since Dogtronics went out of business. I just hope they last as long as dogtronics did. I think after 2 years the rooster was still going on the same original battery.
