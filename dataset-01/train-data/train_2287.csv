2,Not a very good read!,"Kaye goes boring sometimes more often that not, actually. Here she keeps on describing the basic scenery with great detail which after a time gets boring. She did the same thing in Far Pavilions. Where page after page give vivid description of the Afghan bore, sorry I mean war! But the last few pages are quite enjoyable - when the real villain is revealed. Inadequate and the plot also seemed far-fetched, though the same genre is still being written about and seen on TV! The Russian MenaceDeath In Berlin is so much better!"
4,First in a series..,Death in Kashmir: A MysteryM.M.Kaye; a lovely story set immediately post WWII. Spies and intrigue beset a young woman on a skiing holiday in Kashmir. Exceptional descriptions of the scenery and culture of the region offset a bit of a hohum James-Bondish spy story. Kaye obviously loves the region (she was born and grew up in British controlled India) and it shows in her writing. Very enjoyable...
3,light mystery,"This book is good for young girls, but too mild for adults. In author's note, Ms. Kaye states that she tried to control ""the overall length of the book."" I feel she should have lengthened the book in order to develop the characters and plot a little more. She is such a wonderful writer, I just feel a little disappointed."
3,Not One of her Best,"I might have enjoyed this more as an Audio book. Hearing it read with a British accent may have given it more interest or maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a light mystery. I ""listened"" to ""Death in Kenya"", another Kaye novel, and found it much more entertaining."
5,History revealed by the man who kept the golden dawn alive!,"The sincerity of the author and insightful tone of the Authors writing make for fascinating reading for anyone intersted in the golden dawn. Written by the legend that kept the dawn from fading into history, Israel regardie vindicates himself justifiably without slandering his accusors. This book is essential reading to any GD historian or practitioner-absolutely brilliant! We owe Israel regardie so much for what he's done to help our quest."
2,Hard to understand,"This is one of those books that the author must have written when he was stoned. Unless you are already familiar with the golden dawn you are going to be lost in the first chapter. Then even if you know a little about the golden dawn, the author jumps around so much you are lucky if you have any sense about you after chapter three."
3,gaudi,"The book is very nice, good quality pictures, nice presentation.What I didn't like was the size of the book, way too tiny...so I have decided to return it. Amazon has reimbursed my money, and also,I got he choice to keep the book. Thank you, Amazon! I will definitely buy another Gaudi book,at the normal size for my collection."
1,MINIATURE BOOK ! ! NOT FULL SIZE,"BUYER BEWARE. ""Tiny Folio"" is too easily missed.Imagine ordering a full size book; and receiving something four inches square.Apparently, I am not the only one who fell for this glitch.Returned immediately."
2,Good set of photos -- could be better,"The set of photos is comprehensive, however I felt that the lighting of the exterior photos was too flat to convey the visual impact of the buildings.I admit that I have not seen the buildings in person, however I felt that Teshigahara's documentary gave me a much better feel for the buildings -- making their noteriety understandable."
4,"Tiny book, tiny pictures","Pictures are good, with well written history, but 4"" by 4"" book was so tiny."
1,"TINY BOOK, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","If you don't know, ""Tiny Folio"" or ""Tiny Fellows"" really does mean TINY. The description says that it's a hardback book and in a review it is described as being an unusual size and shape. After receiving the book, I went back to the description to see if I overlooked the fact that it is a teensy weensy book. I can't find the 4.5 X 4.75 INCH dimensions anywhere in the description. I ordered it as a gift for someone else, but I will see if I can exchange it for an Antonio Gaudi book that's not quite so tiny."
2,Highly overrated,"Yes, be sure to buy this book here at Amazon instead of paying $295 for it at a Resurfacing workshop, as I did. A so-called Avatar Master won't give you much in the sense of additional explanation or clarification. Most of them are too busy checking if you followed the exercises (some of which are in(s)ane frankly) to the letter.Noticed the lingo in the other reviews? That's the key. Use a complicated gibberish that no-one really understands the meaning of to confuse people.Oh, and if you did Scientology, you might recognize one or two exercises."
5,All you will ever need!,"This is an incredible workbook! Highly recommended. These exercises help explore your blueprint and I have found that there is no life situation that the exercises haven't helped me to take personal responsibility for and resolve! I have uses the exercises many, many times and am still amazed at how powerful they are and how accessible they are for so many people."
5,Amazingly simple techniques to better understand ourselves!,"I have been using the simple and powerful techniques since 1996 (and teaching the tools now)and I am amazed over and over again at how easy it is to use the tools in our daily lives,resolving anger, fear, guilt and judgements and extending more compassion to self and others. By knowing myself more, I am ever more aligned and at peace with who I am, and thus creating more joy in my world. Thanks again, Harry."
5,Wow!!,"A few weeks ago I did the resurfacing workshop which involves working through this book. The results have been amazing. I feel more in control of my life now and able to apply myself to the things I need to be doing. The exercises seemed to awaken something inside me. It is a strange feeling which I've never had before. I guess what makes these techniques powerful is that they don't impose any ideas on you. You come up with the answers yourself. I find anything that I come up with myself is always more powerful than anything anyone esle tells me.If, despite all the self-help books you read, you still find that you are unable to achieve what you want, do this course is for you!"
2,Old age,"Representative of the New Age music cliches, dated production and synthesized culture remain encased in an apathetic flow."
3,A Champion Is Born,"I read this book after UNC won the 2005 NCAA basketball tournament, and to me the most fascinating part was seeing how the foundation for that championship was established during the 2004 season chronicled here. We see the players begin to ""buy in"" to Roy Williams' coaching philosophy (some more quickly than others) and forge themselves into a real team, as opposed a collection of highly talented players, each with his own agenda. There are a lot of books celebrating winning seasons and championship runs (including one about the 2005 Tar Heels), but this is a rarity - a book about how a championship team became a championship team. I recommend it for UNC fans, of course, but also for college basketball fans in general. And for young sports fans who'd like to read about what it takes to be a champion."
3,not such as bright idea,I only gave it three stars because of how nice it looks but it's meaningless to have a SOLAR wind chime that does not light up I placed it in the sun for a week and no light. Maybe I could have came up with a better solution to the problem if it had came with a manual.
4,Had to fix it,"This was a gift to my sister who said it sounded great, but the light didn't work. My brother-in-law found a broken wire that he was able to fix and they couldn't be happier with it. Beautiful at night, and great sounding ALL of the time."
1,Pages Missing,"The book description failed to mention that within the body of the book were actually printed pages that appeared ""MISSING PAGE"" within the entire book. This is beyond misleading from the publisher's description, as minor flaws were mentioned. I would not recommend buying a book that is not intact in its entirety, and certainly not worth the money."
1,Pages Missing!,Believe the description of this work. I don't understand how publishers can simply photocopy old books and sell them as if they were new. There are tons of pages missing from this title.
3,Not Bad!,"No voices,just grunts and growns.Cheap but great affects ok for children 7 and up.Story line ok,but could have been better.My son at 7yrs liked it!"
4,i'm inspired,"well, i do love dialog in movies this one expressed it through both eyes in a universal language. not understanding what anyone was saying since it was all alien language i thought at earth we would hear English or something,.. instead it was still gibberish. however it was all easy to translate through body movement, gestures and actions. pretty much inspired me to want to clean up the earth , build my own interstellar space craft in my garage , pack up and go travel. awesome movie. a must see if you need a clearer eye as to what it might be like somewhere else in space and the need to dream and do. great for all ages. also a good reminder as to the troubles and toils of owning a cat. patience is a must."
2,Very little Moisture!,"This product is just another off the shelf shampoo claiming to be much better than the others. My hair was coarse and dry from coloring and chemical straightening when I tried this. I've been using L'Oreal and was hoping this is a good alternative to their salon range. However, this shampoo left my hair just as dry and perhaps even more frizzy after a few washes! If you're looking for true nature's therapy you might want to try a homemade hair mask or hot olive oil massage! I later decided to pay more for Joico products and I don't regret it."
2,Leaves Stain!,"Great diaper for nighttime - especially heavy wetters. However, our son has sensitive skin and it leaves bluish bruise-like streaks in the morning. It's simply a bad dye they must be using. So, if your child has sensitive skin - beware!"
5,great deal,"It's definetly a better deal this way, buying them online, as long as there is free shipping... and they work well for a 2 year old that thinks he's too big for diapers!"
3,okay absorbency,I recommend this product for kids who are being potty-trained but still need the extra protection at night. They are not 100% leak-free however -- they hold a little more than the daytime pull-ups.
4,Fits kids over weight limit,"My child is about 42 pounds and these still fit him really well. For the targeted age and weight range, they are also less expensive than the alternative made by Huggies, which is those GoodNights underpants.Once in awhile they leak but overall, excellent product."
2,Disappointed,"They're OK, but definately not as absorbent as the overnight diapers. My son soaks through if he urinates during the night."
1,This calendar has nothing to do with the REAL Mary Magdalene,"It's a gnostic phony based on the well reported errors documented in ""The DaVinci Code"". Go elsewhere for the historical, real, actual Mary Magdalene as who was at the Crucifixion and at the Tomb after the Resurrection."
2,More Stories From Olga,"Storytelling guinea pig Olga Da Polga discovers her soulmate in this sequel. Taken for a weekend to the seaside, Olga meets the mysterious Boris, whose talent for invention rivals her own."
4,nice replica for the price,You get what you pay for. Not a 100% on revolver details but worth the money. Looks very close to the No. 3 S&W.
2,Didn't hold the plug,"The adaptor works, but the plug won't stay in. My husband has overcome the problem with some sticky tape - at least he can shave while in the UK - but that isn't really the idea. My advice would be not to bother with this one: instead, spend a bit more and get better quality."
1,"""Soft"" means ""no support""",This arch support is a strap with a soft pad that fits underneath the arch. Soft pads do not provide support. This product is ineffective.I purchased it from SkyMall.
2,Close but no cigar,"The idea appears great. They did indeed seem to help/feel comfortable for the limited time they stayed in place. However they loosened all too quickly even with shoes and socks on. The support was then gone.Something like this works better for me - http://www.amazon.com/PediFix-Bandage-Support-Problem-Aches/dp/B000RHLKC8/ref=pd_sbs_hpc_3 It has elastic and stays in place at least the Equate version I got at Walmart.FWIW, my take is that the ideal product would have the extra under arch padding and ergonomic design of this Protec item coupled with elastic tension in the adjustment band so that it doesn't work itself loose.Just my hopefully helpful $.02, YMMV."
4,excellent help for plantar fascia issues,"this little project did more, instantly, for my plantar fascia issues than all the other stuff i've bought put together buy extras, you'll wear them out"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you are suffering from bone spurs on the heel or plantar fascitis, don't waste your money on this product! The bands that wrap around your feet are not elastic, and do not stretch to hold good pressure! They slip and slide around on your foot. I am not at all pleased with these.Look for a brace that goes around your ankle, and has an elastic strap under your foot for constant pressure."
3,They work...,"I have fallen arches and my feet truly hurt, pain level 10. Th Pro-Tech has the compression and form that offers some comfort. I have found that I cannot wear them with my sneakers, they do not stay in position when putting shoe on. That being said, I do wear them at the end of my day and they do offer a level of relief."
4,Arch support helps plantar fasciitis,"I was looking for something that would allow me to be barefoot and reduce the pain of plantar fasciitis. This support does give good support to the arch by both tension and a pad under the arch. This is no substitute for good shoes with arch support, but for when you need the extra support for bare feet or in shoes with no support, this definitely helps."
4,Relief!,"My arches ached - after running, after walking around - they ached. And while I don't think I have plantar fasciitis (my feet hurt after use, not after rest), these arch supports are giving me some relief. Right now, I'm wearing them pretty much 24hrs a day - I only take them off to shower or ice. They are comfortable in shoes, on bare feet, on top of socks. The manufacturer recommends that you cut the strap, once you've found the proper size - I echo this suggestion, to prevent the strap from bunching up in a shoe.One funny/odd note: the supports are labeled ""Left"" and ""Right"" (helpful). But my pair are labeled upside down. If I have the ""Left"" brace properly aligned to go on my foot, then the word ""Left"" is actually upside down on the label. It's not a biggie, but it did drive me to check the instructions the first few times I wore the supports, to make sure I was putting them on properly."
2,Support user,"Product works to support the arch, bit it is poorly made and will not last very long. Would look for a superior support device before buying this brand again"
2,Not so great,Not that durable. Wore them for a while and they helped but after a couple of weeks they started to fall apart. Not a great solution.
3,Better than nothing,"They do an OK job of supporting the arch, and help relieve a bit of the stress on my foot, so they do help. But they're not quite what I'd expected. I guess I assumed they'd be elasticized. They're not, so they don't stay in place very well. In loose shoes, such as garden clogs, they tend to slip around and wind up upside down where they support nothing (even wearing socks). I'd assumed I could wear them with socks around the house, but they slip right off the foot when you walk. When changing shoes, they slip off with the shoe most of the time, which is a bit inconvenient. But they work fairly well when worn with shoes. I'll try something else when they wear out."
1,So uncomfortable!,I had plantar fascitis and I ordered this item and it actually hurt more walking with it than with the fascitis!
3,does virtually nothing,"These ""arch supports"" really do little to support the arch. The padding inside is not thick enough (only 1/8"" thick) to notice much difference. The package says ""provides upward compression"", which is what I was looking for, but I don't feel any compression or lift to my arch."
2,"Not great, hardly any ""support""","I bought these so that I could walk around my house with arch support when I have no shoes on. There is very very little ""support"" and is more like a little tiny bump that didn't make a difference at all. I will have to maybe sew some additional material or something on here to make it supportive. Not only was it hardly what I would call supportive, but I wear a women's size 8.5 shoe and these were slightly too big, but they did fit with a lot of material left over on the top once I wrapped them around.. Overall, I definitely don't think they're worth $19, maybe $6 for a pair if they had more ""support"". I should have just made something for myself.. I think I'll continue to use these, but with a lot more added material that I will put on for myself for support."
1,Does nothing,This product is cheaply made and provided little to no support. I had better results with an inexpensive shoe insert. Reading these other reviews make me believe they are not genuine.
1,Worthless product,"These arch supports have no means of adjusting the tension. It's just a pad with velcro straps attached. If they were made of neoprene or lycra or some other stretchy fabric then they might be of some use. First aid cloth tape does a far better job of holding up the arch. Without tension there is simply no support, just a padded, flat lump underfoot, nothing more. Save your money."
2,Not the best,"I was hoping for some solid pressure on my arches, and I was hoping the Velcro would do that... but alas it doesn't. The product slides around (which is super annoying) and doesn't really make my arches feel any better. I would not buy these again."
3,save your money.,"these are ok, but only if you wear them over socks. I don't wear socks on a daily basis and these slide right bare feet. you could use an ace bandage and get the same support."
1,Very Poor Arch Support,"I really wanted this product to work, but it just does not. The arch support in this product is simply not enough to support anyone with pes cavus."
5,Helps,It helps a lot with the pain. I use it only at night and during the day I prefer to put paddings on my shoes.
4,Plantar faciitis,Quick service. Packaged well. Product worked as described and I would recommend it for anyone with Plantar fasciitis or heel soreness.
3,It is not for a size 7 foot.,It is not for a size 7 foot. It is too big probably this is okay with sneakers.
3,arch supporter,Its ok but slips foward. Needs to be made with material that does not make it slip. Use elasitc not velcro.
1,Keep slipping out of position,I bought it for my daughter. It keeps slipping out of position inside the shoes while she moves around. I ended up just shelve the thing. I did find 3/4 length gel insole to be effective in preventing her foot pain.
1,Deflated Supports,"I was really looking forward to getting these arch supports because of the claim that they would help with pain in your feet which causes pain in your knees when not supported properly. I put them on to wear around the house in my tennis shoes while I cleaned house. At first they did the trick, but as the day wore on they just lost support so the next day when I started to put them on I found they had completely flattened out and gave no support at all. I have called the manufacturer and am waiting to hear what they plan on doing about replacing them."
3,"quite soft for arch ""support"".","It's quite soft for arch support and doesn't keep you arch from extending, but doesn't let it go completely flat. A heel supportive device like Dr. Shoes is a much better solution for my foot."
2,Only minimal support,"Wish I had read more reviews before wasting $20 on these. They help a little bit, but not as much as I had hoped."
2,bad product,its doesnt work... it keeps slipping off if you wear it when sleeping and it doesn't feel rite walking in a shoe with it on..
2,Might work better for someone else,Not very supportive. Felt more like a sport sock than support. Could not wear with my socks inside my sneakers.
2,ok,Doesnt help much. Not enough support.Slides off when you put your shoes on. But you do get one for each foot.
3,Arch supports are just okay,They are okay but not really comfortable to wear in shoes. I mostly wear around the house when doing housework.
2,Not helpful,"I am a runner with high arches and have been experiencing arch pain despite using rigid arch insoles. I wanted to use these arch supports both during runs and around the house. They do NOT stay on my feet barefoot, and the Velcro is scratchy on the top. Plus the pad is pretty small and didn't feel supportive under my arches at all. I couldn't wear these in my running shoes either because they were too bulky and slipped around. Felt like I had paper towels wadded under my feet. Maybe these help support flat feet, but not high arches. I will try taping instead."
3,Pretty good but did not work all that wellf or me,"I bought these to use in my exercise program called Nia [...] which is done barefoot. When I was dancing, they loosened and slipped around. All the pictures show with socks. I am sure that with socks they stay in place better.The arch support was not really high enough for me either. I think they are meant to be worn with shoes. To me, the pictures infer that they are to be worn around the house in socks, and they might be good for that.So, I am giving them a tepid review because they did not work well for my application. They may be ok for other folks."
4,Resasonable Support for Plantar Fasciitis but No Orthodic Replacement,"I suffer terribly from plantar fascitis in the right arch and heel for years. I spent a fortune on foot braces, night splints, Power Step insoles and high quality prescription orthodotics. This Pro-Tec support works great for when I'm sleeping, barefoot or in flip-flops and virtually anytime I'm out of the orthodotics support. If you wear them as I do barefoot or in flip-flops you will need to replace them several times per year as the velcro wears out.The velcro strap isn't the best and you have to make sure it is flat when you tighten it on your foot or it will bend and irritate the top and side of your foot. Having said all that, I am purchasing 2 more now to replace the one I purchased 3 months ago."
2,Disappointed,"I supposed that this works for most people. I guess that my condition just doesn't seem to work. This was for plantar facia, which I have."
3,Needs a better design,"These are not bad. When I wear them with shoes that have no arch support at all they work good. The biggest problem with them is the velcro that holds them in place. There is very little fabric so when I try to slip my foot into a shoe while wearing them the velcro attachment comes undone. And I cannot even wear them with boots. They slip completely off by the time my foot is in place. The only way around this is to wear 2 pair of socks. One under the arch support to keep it from rubbing (yes, they rub and pinch when in direct contact with the skin), and one over the arch support to keep it in place. Few of my shoes and boots are big enough to comfortably do this, even with thin socks. Now that spring is coming I'll try them with some lighter shoes and sandals and see how they work."
2,I was disappointed.,"I was disappointed in these as there wasn't really a lot of actual ""support"". They twisted around in my shoes and the velcro snagged my socks."
1,A bandaid would give more support,"Not sure how people could give these 5 stars, they give zero support. Do not waste your money. Buy athletic tape and learn how to strap your arch properly. If I could give them zero stars I would have, total junk."
2,Could be better,Provides limited support to tired old arches and flat feet. The problem is that it is hard to get around your foot to make tight enough. I bought the largest size available for my size 12 feet and it barely fits.
3,a little uncomfortable,"This item is fine with a sandal or barefoot. The strap is very uncomfortable,it itches! The support is ok,but not great. This doesnt work well in a sneaker. If you have high instep this is def not for you. It did give some relief in a sandal but after a couple of hours it is just too hard against the arch"
1,"Cheaply made garbage, do yourself a favor and don't buy this","The straps barely reach around my foot attaching at an overlap of about 2 centimeters. The flaps easily detach and come off. The foot padding doesn't lift my arch very much, it hardly makes a difference. I wish I saved my money but I'm too lazy to return stuff. I wish I could go back in time and not purchase this though."
1,The pits,"These are the worst arch supports ever. The fabric has absolutely no give to it, so there really is no way to tighten it around your foot. They slip, slid and bunch with impunity. Don't waste your money. If I could give them zero stars I would."
4,Feel great,"I've tried a few different versions of this type of foot brace but these are the best. They fit well, feel good and are high quality so they don't fall apart like so many others. I've worn them for 10+ hours a day for weeks and they still look brand new."
3,Pro-tec arch supports,These have helped some of the symptoms i have with plantar's faciitis. The velcro is long and has to be folded under the foot to fit into shoes.
5,great show!,I loved this episode of victorious. It was very funny and interesting so I reccomend that you buy this episode of victorious
4,victorious review,It was really good quality. I liked how quick it downloaded and was very pleased. I will rent videos again in the future.
3,"It's Okay, but Not Very Good Film Quality","I got this for my Dad, because he loved the DVD Blue Angels: A Year in the Life. But, he was disappointed with this one. After watching it once, he said I could trade it back in on Amazon. In contrast, he watches A Year in the Life over and over again. The film quality on this one is not very good...like an older VHS of 80's film quality. Also, the music is very funky...very early 90's synth. LOL. He did say it had some interesting facts and footage, but it wasn't one he would watch again."
2,Ok ! could`ve been alot better !,"Its ok, but you would think being released in 2012 it would have newer footage of the blue angels and an hour and forty five minutes on 4 dvds are you serious.It could have all been put on one disk. Should have gotten "" Blue Angels : a year in the life "".The seller was on time tho, yea."
1,very disapointed,"I am a big Blue Angel fan, seen them in person at least 14 times and expected alot more from this dvd. Picture quality was terrible right out of older vhs not dvd. Total disrespect to two great flying teams.... buy the blu ray of the Blue Angels it is money much better spent.........."
1,Disappointed,"After seeing the Blue Angels a couple of months ago, I was looking for a DVD showing them. I preordered this so that I would have the most recent. Unfortunately, all of the footage is very old, the background music is a bad variation of ""Danger Zone."" Being old, the picture quality is poor. This did not keep my attention nor the attention of my preschooler. I have only watched one of the DVDs out of the pack because of this."
4,Truth can be stranger than fiction.,"This book is based on the real-world experiences of author Dr. Tom K. Stern. It is Dr. Sterns Phillipine adventure lived through the eyes of his fictional re-incarnation: Dr. Todd Ellison. The names may have been changed to protect the innocent. The more outlandish the scenario, the more likely it really happened just as it is written. It has been said that truth is stranger than fiction. Gold Fever is a thin read (296 pages), that is fat on details. It is a tall and engrossing tale. Lots of details about the jungle rebels, etc.Dr. Stern is just now releasing his latest book: Vatican Gold. I hope this leads to a trilogy. How about: Hollywood Gold? Gold Fever would make an excellent movie, and I imagine Vatican Gold will as well. I gave the book (Gold Fever) 4-stars because it was too short! I cannot wait for the Dr. Stern gold series to hit the big screen! Welcome to Hollywood, Dr. Ellison!"
5,"Sweet Jeezuz, this iz good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Okay Folks, are you tired of all those boring novels? Do you ever get upset when all you can find is a cook book to read or one of those Harry Potter things? If your answer was yes you've got to get this book! Tom Stern really rocks the book world with his novel. The setting is excellent, the romance is steamier than a hot tub, and the action is on fire! Make sure you call 911 before you start reading because you're gonna light yourself on fire!!!!!"
3,A perspective of a person from the mathematical community.,"I read most of this book. It is a self-contained and a reader-friendly book. It gives a lot of intuition and understanding. However, I must admit-for the sake of objectivity-that some computations lack mathematical rigour and some computations are incorrect. I hope that the author reads my comment..."
3,Good but not the best of Prince,"I collect Prince's albums as I believe he is one of the most talented musicians on the planet. However, this one (while, yes, interesting) is probably not his best achievement, compared, say, to any of his albums from the 90's. Planet Earth seems to be a better and more solidly mastered album that he just released, summer 2007. Once I got both in my hands and realized that he can still right coherent melodies, I decided that this album only deserves 3 stars. He is great though, no matter what I or anybody else says!"
5,M'm M'm,"I got this CD yesterday and I am pleased! I didn't think I was going to like it cos I'm a fan of the ""I Wanna Be Your Love"" and ""Computer Blue,"" ""Bambi"" Prince, but when I heard Prince's ""Fury"" and ""The Dance"" I couldn't stop listening! I listened to it all afternoon and then I exercised to it and then I listened to again this morning while working (I work from home) and I'm still listening to it cos I keep playing back most of the songs. And I can't keep still in my seat."
4,my 2 cents on 3121,"played the new cd for about 6 hours straight.pure recognizable classic prince, which brings me to say, with my expectation level so high, i actually look for something different from him.apparently, the mainstream critics are raving over the album and new listeners of prince won't be dissappointedthat being said, except for diamonds and pearls, sign o' the times and for you, no prince album jumps out as palatable as a medium order of mcdonalds fries.this CD like most of his others have to be savored like a six course dinner to be fully appreciatedthe next test, is the headphone test to pick up all the little prince nuancesin my experience, prince music has to grow on you as it becomes part of your music listening regimenthats all,meO(+>btw, if u'r gonna give a 1 star review, u better make a constructive rather than a ignorant critique. i mean what was it specifically that u did not like???"
5,Prince is funkier than 3 day old collard greens,"That sums it up. This is a return to booty rocking funky A$$ Prince! The man is in his 40s and he can still bring it. He's a musical genius, and I'm happy he has the freedom to make the music HE wants and isn't worrying about airplay. Good CD, great artist, and I hope young people give him a chance and discover what a real musician can do."
5,A Breakthrough,"There are albums that put conventions on its ear and change the pop dynamic. I'm talking about albums like ""A Kind of Blue"", ""Pet Sounds"", ""Revolver"" and ""Sgt. Pepper's"". After listening through this album once, I thought ""this is one of THOSE albums."" The fusion of R&B;, Rock and Pop styles ebbs and flows like tremendous river. There are wild rides (3121, Black Sweat, Get on the Boat) and slow sensual rides with beauty (most notably Te Amo Corazon).Prince (as always) uses the studio as his best instrument. For somebody who has been releasing albums for almost 30 years to use the modern studio in this way shows hope for all of us over 40 year olds."
5,Classic Prince!!! Thank You Prince!!!,Prince has never stopped putting out great music. This album is a complete winner in my opinion. All the songs are distinct from one another. I have always liked how he uses a female background singer in much of his music. This time Tamar is the singer and she adds a nice touch to the songs and compliments Prince's voice very well. I would actually prefer Jill Jones' voice but Tamar is excellent. Overall this cd should not be overlooked....
5,I DO WANT TO COME TO THE PARTY,"As a new Prince fan, I am proud to be apart of this new Prince album era. This is an absolutely brilliant album.Prince experiments with great and futuristic sounds. The beats are addicting and groovy.Great party album... I hope he has a successful year.This is by far Prince's best album since Around the World In A Day! Not to mention it is slated to be his first No. 1 Billboard debut since 1985!GOOD JOB PRINCE!THIS IS A MUST BY FOR 2006!"
3,Album is o.k.,"I like the CD and if not for Te Amo Corazon I just might like it much more. I do believe it is worth the buy. Problem is with Prince's albums is that they do not match his live shows. For those who ask ""where is the funk"" pick up One Nite Alone...Live! box set and you will see and hear. Prince still does and has always matched his genius funk from the 80's. Prince and his band are the best going today."
3,Average...falls short of Prince's capabilities,"This CD continues with what Prince was doing on his last CD Musicology. It's nothing special. Prince seems to have lost his ability to write well crafted songs. His lyrics are now bland and unoriginal, and his melodies are repetitive. With each release I get less hopeful for a return to form for Prince. A return to expiremental yet well written music. But he seems to be obsessed with being accepted by the younger music buying crowd and therefore sacrifices his art because of it."
1,god awful!,"this album is totaly unforgivable, the only saving grace is ""black sweat"" which is classic prince, it seems that he has disapeared up his own rear end, either that or he's run out of inspiration. This really is utter trite!"
2,overrated,"maybe he's better looking than michael jackson, but I can't say the same for his music. People know who the real musical genius out of these two are and it sure aint the once-purple one."
5,I didn't think it could get any better than Musicology.,"I absolutely love this cd. Everytime I open a Prince cd, I get a little scared because you never know what you are going to get. I am always pleasantly surprised. This cd takes you all the way back to when you first started liking Prince. I have listened to ""The Dance"" about a million times now. Tell everyone that you know about 3121."
2,That's It !,"More than one time I said to myself: That's it, Prince! I've had enough of your songs! But then again, I've paid the price just to see if I could discover another of his ""pearls"". And that's the case with ""The Dance"", the only one where apparently he's followed his instincts. As for the rest... Well, another composer trying to please the majority with his ""easy hits""."
3,It's OK,"Nothing special here. Musicology was much better. He has some nice tunes, and I am sure his tour will be rockin' as always, but a pretty pedestrian performance by the Man, the Myth, the Legend.I will still go see him live, you cannot beat it."
4,"A very good Prince album, if your a fan, a must buy","Prince's new album is very good. I can't say it's excellent, but it definitly brings it back to his roots. If you are looking for that old Prince feel, than this is an album for you. He hasn't broken any new ground and I don't think he is planning on breaking any more new ground than he already has. This is a solid album. You definitly need to give it several listens to fully appreciate it. Overall, it is typical Prince but in a good way."
5,DATED???????? I THINK NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am in no way a paid intern!!!! This CD is amazing! Prince has always been the musician's musician. His music is neither dated or boring and he has been pumping out music for over 20+ years. But I digress.....3121 brings Prince back to his Pop sexual feeling music and I am glad he did. All tracks flow into one another and I cannot stop listening to it. Thank you Prince.
1,corny,"Prince can't do nothing hardly anything worth hearing from a studio again. the writing has been on the wall for a long,long time that he needs a outside Producer,writer&a good editor. digging through the vaults just re-piece up tracks ain't cool. this record sounds like alot of things he did in the 90's&part 80's which while good musicianship shows somebody clearly out of ideas&still trying to be hip,but sounding very tired&dated. He is best suited to the stage.His albums have been corny for nearly 20 years straight to me&How He keeps getting deals is beyond me.re-cycle grooves&under-written songs with genric production is tired."
2,Mediocre,I only liked 2 songs on this CD. It sounds like Prince is just going through the motions. The passion in his music is gone. What happened to the Funk?
3,"For a Prince album, ""3121"" is yet another disappointment...","The problem with this CD, like so many of his past releases in the last several years, is that all the technically well-crafted songs just aren't that memorable. I can't recall a single enjoyable melody even after two straight listens, and I've already become bored with the album. Compare the material here with stronger, more inventive songs from THE GOLD EXPERIENCE, COME, or even BATMAN and you'll notice that nothing really stands out."
4,Hello old friend.,"This review comes from a once obsessed Prince fan who had a falling out with his guitar god when Emancipation was released.Since then I haven't bothered to buy a Prince album. Then 3121 is released and I start hearing the title track on the radio. I couldn't believe what I was hearing: a new Prince song that I really liked. So I check out some samples on Amazon and what do I hear? More songs that I really like. What else can I do but buy it and give a whirl? Since then, I listen to it a few times a week, if not a few times a day.What's so great about it? It really sounds like a throw back to some of his older albums updated with his newer production style.Feel free to disagree, but it's really nice having an old friend around again."
1,skip this one,"i am a huge Prince fan. while i realize he has not really had any big hits his last few albums, i nonetheless wanted to give his more recent cd's a try. and i am also a completist- if i like an artist, i try to get everything they have done. i listened to this one twice after getting it, and i gave it away the next day. there was really no songs on this that had any spark. nothing was all that memorable to me. based on some people who gave this really good reviews, i had expected much better. i'd say a much better more recent release by him would be ""rave Unto The Joy Fantastic"". Prince seems to have lost his edge, but i still love him and am waiting for him to re-invent himself. this one is for purists only."
5,3121 is a certified TKO,"3121 delivers a knock-out from the fist play. It sounds very contempoaray POP-R&B but more musical than anything recent on the radio. To appreciate Prince's music and career, one must simply enjoy music_ all kinds. It's difficult to predict what he'll come up with next, and that's what makes it very exciting to listen. My Fave tracks: 3121, Te Amo Corazon( Luv the Latin romance ), Incense & Candles, Love, Fury (!), and The Dance. I thought the last song "" Get on the Boat "" sounded too much like "" Musicology "" and "" Satisfied "" also sounds a little out of place in this body of work_ much like a Musicology album outtake ( al la "" On the Couch "" ). I hope Prince continues to dare himself with his music. Also his performance at the Brit-Awards was Incredible_ I swear he's getting better. He doesn't have to play Purple Rain anymore to define who he is_ I hope he has as much faith in the new material. Give it a listen."
5,Prince Is In The HIZOUSE!!!!!,"I just wish I had been one of the ones with a Purple Ticket to hear him play it live! I love this CD from beginning to end! The only Prince fans that won't love this work are the ones who are still stuck in the 80's! Yall might be stuck but Prince once again is showing us he's not. It's wonderful to hear how he's grown up. He hasn't lost a beat. I hear Truth's influence throughout this Album and how refreshing it is, especially with all the junk out there. I'm proud to be a fan!"
5,He's Back!!!,This album just shows how versatile Prince still is and that the brother still has it! The song 'The Word'...so heavy. Buy this album and support real musicianship. We love you Prince!
5,Off the hook!,"I dig this CD sooo much! I hear vibrations of James Brown, Jimi Hendrex, Brother's Johnson all the while Prince is beign his wild-child funky self. My four favorites are Incense and Candles, Love, The Word, and Beautiful, Loved & Blessed. I am wearing the CD out! It's funky, fun, has bounce but also reveals a more mature, spiritual Prince."
3,let's see if this is it,I like it. I listened it more than once. It caught my attention made me take notice of his new music. Made me feel like he did a few years ago when he still made really good music.
3,Prince Vs. Beck?,The reviewer had it all wrong...Beck wants to be the next Prince!Oh yeah...My review...Good album!
4,GOOD OLD LOUCHE POP,"After lemons like Musicology and that quirky instrumental endeavor with 14 minute jams, it is good to see Prince treading back to his classic roots of funky pop. About time.As an album, 3121 has its eccentric feet planted in the past. From the sizzling trippy-hop funk of 'Lolita' or 'Black Sweat', to the raggedy punk rock of '3121' or 'Fury', to the silken jazzy undertones of 'Te Ame Corazon' or 'The Dance', to the ballad goodness of 'Satisfied', this should satisfy the most devout of Prince aficionados.A new-fangled sound experience it may be not, but it is the most versatile riff to come out of this troupe in years. You won't be disappointed if you dig your funk and have been known to like Prince in the past."
5,Energetic New Sound,I was surprised and stirred by this album. Prince has come a long way and gone through several transitions. 3121 is generally a very energetic R&B album if one had to categorize it. It is definitely not akin to anything he did in the 80s. The sound is current and is certainly timely and has a propensity to grow one.
3,I was looking for more musicology jams.,"Hi. I am a PRN fan from 1980. When I purchased this LP on CD. I must confess, I was really looking for some of the songs to be more stand out and then have some of the songs be... well Prince type songs you know funky but weird yet very good. I have owned every prince LP form For You to 3121 and I must say they have all been very good listens. But for this one I was really looking for him to put it on my hears and inspire me to want to be musician are just blast the music in my headphones late at night and jam out. But this LP kind of only had like one real jam out song. once again I am a PRN fan. I don't have anything bad to say because every song is well put together and has its own sound but I use to listen to Lovesexy all night and jam out and every PRN fan knows that lovesexy is not the most highly rated of PRN Lps so you all know that I am not speaking from hate. Track 5 is the only song that on first listen I liked."
2,honestly....,"prince is not back just yet. musicology was a mess. it was the first prince album that i couldn't sit and listen to all the way thru. 3121 is an improvement but it feels flat and a little uninspired. i've always been excited when prince had a new album coming out but since his conversion...that ""spark"" of genius...that raw, sometimes erotic influence is not seen anywhere in his music. it is like he has a chastity belt on his brain. i'm not saying he has to say every filthy thing that comes to his mind but come on, sex is always on the brain if you're a guy...even if you are 4' 10"" and built like a woman. i rather he be an unpronounceable symbol than a convert. but like another reviewer said he's gotta be happy, that's what's important.but for those of you who are calling this better than anything he did in the 80's or 90's....WHAT?!"
2,"Prince goes pop, what a fraud! 3 good songs out of 12!","Prince has become what he once hated, a pop star puppet just like Elton John! Actually, at least Elton knows what singles to release. If you want the real old school Prince, cop these and leave this pop nonsense alone!:Dirty MindPurple RainGold ExperienceChaos And DisorderThe Legendary Black AlbumBatman"
2,believe in the HYPE and conspiracy!!!!!!!!!!,"well where to start,i do believe some people must be paid to give those reviews,but i also believe some people that gave those reviews,don't like sign o the times,so there is the problem i am not askin the purple majesty to rehash old stuff but it is true,he lost the capability to craft good song's,the man is awfully desturbed and it shows,lack's inspiration and refuses to understand that he got both worlds workin his black and white side that is the main factor here,u the yes mam people will not make this record successful because sometimes u can not fool,hopefully he will soon wake up and truly be able to make music from his heart,t'il then i will put on the true records of his,and after all music is a matter of taste,but unfortunately my antenna is not in tune anymore with his output,to bad!!!!!!!!!"
4,The Black Beck??? WTF???,"What's with this guy callin' Prince 'The Black Beck'? Are you kidding? It's more like the other way around.....That statement is so offensive to me....anyway, this album? Love ITT!!It's Prince. I don't think I have enough words or a big enough vocabulary to describe this man's genius. Why are only a few of us blessed with such talent?"
4,Tamara ~ Prince's new muse?,"Finally! A Prince album you can get into! Not the rambling acid-jazz joints or the self-indulgent preachy gospel sermons he's been turning out past several years. I must admit I've been a little jaded and cynical from his less than sterling recent efforts but WHAT A COMEBACK! How many of you remember way back in '85 performing live on stage in Syracuse, when he turned his back to the audience and looked up to the heavens and said: ""But they dig it when i'm BAD...!"" I'm glad he's finally come to his senses. Yes your purple highness, we loyal subjects LOVE it when you're bad! This ain't Church, it's Showbiz! Its refreshing to see the Artist having SOo much fun again! And it shows in his music. Take BLACK SWEAT, it's cool sexy funk. Quintessential Prince. A true genius with STYLE! Guess we have Tamara to thank, huh? In any case, WELCOME BACK PRINCE! We missed you!"
2,Sorely Disappointed,"I bought the cd Musicology and enjoy it thoroughly. I was excited to get the new cd. However, I find many of the tracks very strange and a little disturbing. (the first song kind of creeps me out.) I give this cd a 2 because I do enjoy 2 of the songs on the cd but I am dissapointed because I hoped for better."
3,Clipper evaluation,"If this has a motor, instead of just vibrator action, it feels similar to the older cheaper clippers we have used for years. Somewhat disappointing with having to adjust the noise and vibration, which is not any better than the low cost types. Cuts good but hangs up blade to blade some time when trying to adjust noise and vibration. Disappointing for the price we paid. Would not have purchased it if the above was known."
2,TOTALLY USELESS !,"It's totally useless , the book is bad organize and not clear to children. Besides there is no instruction for parent to teach their children."
1,Not clear picture,"I thought the picture was going to be sharp and clear but it is not. The piture is pixilated...like when you blow up a picture you see all the lil' dots and stuff. The edges are not sharp but blurred. I was VERY Disappionted when I got this because it would have been perfect for my place but the blurred picture didn't work....unfortunately. On the other hand if you can deal with a blurred picture the quality of the cloth curtain was very nice and thick, that I was happy with. Now I am only remarking on the calla lilies shower curtain I don't know what the others will look like maybe they are different."
5,Stark and Serene,"I bought the Marsh House curtain, and am very pleased with the product. The fabric is heavy and hangs well, smooth to the touch. The photo is not blurry, it is soft around the edges yes. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a black and white bathroom, and if you like landscape photos."
1,In Bad Taste,"Why buy New Age instrumental music when you can hear them for free at supermarkets and in elevators? I got this as a present and now I don't know what to do with it (I can't burn it for fear of releasing dangerous chemicals into the atmosphere). New Age piano music is making some amateur pianists complacent of their abilities. Boswell, like Tesh and Yanni, exploits the sustain pedal like a romance author with foreplay, resulting in pretentious melodies without parallels. The success of these musicians is starting a dangerous trend: pianists cutting their training short to pursue solo careers. For the sake of good taste, banish this to where it belongs."
3,Sturdy but easily scuffed,"While I am sure these will last forever, they were already beginning to become scuffed in any spot where the iron contacted itself, the black was chipping off to reveal the silver metal underneath?"
2,16 mm silent movie,"This is a reel to reel 16 mm silent movie filmed during ""Help"" shootings by a crew member (maybe an opeator or is wife, I dunno). The movie is really short (16 minutes) and shows little Beatles action. It's a die hard collector item (I own the VHS version)."
1,"Cheap, broke immediatly","Very Low quality, lenses were falling out of the glasses before I even removed them from the package. One hinge snapped after wearing for about two hours. Yes they are only $4, but if they break so quickly, what is the point."
1,Cheap,These are so cheaply made you would be lucky to get one wearing out of them. If you are buying them for a costume they will get you through. If you are buying them to look cool spend your money on something else.
4,Okay,This was used to secure a propane tank to a hand cart. It alone would not do the job. I used a tie down with this and the two of them together do th job.
5,Works great,This bungee cord works great! It's light and has a solid feeling when I used it. I know I can rely on it when I needed it.
3,not like the picture,"I almost threw this in the trash. The adjustable end does NOT fold back 180 degrees like the picture shows. When you pull the two hooks apart, it will lock but it will never look like the picture."
3,Don't know.,"Bought these to help in a move. Ended up not needing them.I am HAPPY to do reviews for my Amazon purchases but think it's ridiculous that I am repeatedly asked to do them once I have chosen not to do so. And then, when I cave in and rate a product, I am also required to author a narrative with a minimum number of characters. How much can be written about a light bulb that is a good price and lights up when turned on???!!!"
2,Good but short,"The product looks and feels sturdy and the adjusting mechanism is great. Only problem, there's no need to adjust! the length is short. Yeah, I know I should have looked closely at the specs but what do you expect from measurements given in inches and mm for the same product and different dimensions. There's also practically no stretch to it. Either look for something else or get 2 of them."
2,"too short and thick, but strong","I don't recommand this product that is too short and thick to tie.But It is really strong.If you need a strong and short cord, buy it.I bought it, never used it."
5,Excellent adjustable cord!,"What can I say? really do the job in combination with a MAGNA CART PERSONAL HANDTRUCK, the cord is strong and elastic, you can adjust the long of the cord to get more preasure and lock the objects that you were assuring, really good purchase for few bucks!"
4,Not stretchy enough,"This bungee cord seems to be well-build and is very easy to adjust, so it would work well for a lot of applications. However, it does not stretch as much as I would like for the travel cart I bought it for. If you are looking to use this because you need a firm cord, this will be perfect (keeping the trunk to a car closed around an oversized item, etc). If you need more give in it, another type of bungee might be better."
4,Very nice,"The product was as advertised, works very easy and should do the job I bought them for with ease. I would recommend this product to my friends and family and most likely will in the coming days."
5,well designed,"Good product at a reasonable price, the locking mechanism works and that is a good feature. The hooks are sturdy. I am happy with the quality and for what I will use it for."
5,Throw out the Home Depot hardware use this,"When you buy hardware with bifold doors, the hardware is junk. This is ten times better. Ease of installation and quality of functioning with this is great."
1,"there are better books out there, this is not one of them","to be blunt, this book is not good. hungerford does not explain how to do precalculus very well in this book. it is difficult to read and to understand. a good example is if you were programming a VCR when the instructions are japanese (no offense). this is probably the reason why it is so difficult. if hungerford made this book more student friendly, then maybe he would've gotten a better review. until then, look for another book, this one is definately not one of the best."
4,Works great to supress sound in a computer case,"Pros:Easy to work with, does a decent job of suppressing sound from computer case fans. It won't make your system silent, but will drop the sound volume some. My system is near silent now.Cons: kind of expensive"
5,It's true...,"Sure I mixed the sound for The Awkward Comedy Show but that doesn't change the fact that everything mentioned in the other reviews is true. This is a funny, funny show. I've been subjected to this movie several dozen times and I still crack up. Working on the film has also given me the unique ability to attest to the fact that Victor Varnado is indeed a douche bag who despite having made millions off of the film's sale to Comedy Central, still owes me $500.Where's my money Victor??!!"
3,Master lock made in China,"I have been using countless Master combo locks for many years and just got a new one. The lock looks OK, however, I am concerned that it is now produced in China - which is written on its packaging. Unfortunately, Amazon had no word on the country of origin. Master locks I purchased before were produced in the USA. Just think about extra fuel and packaging used to bring this lock here from the other side of the world. I know that some companies still produce same kind of locks in the USA. If you want to make purchasing decisions with environmental considerations like myself, consider a lock from a company, which produces it in the USA. I guess, no more master locks for me."
2,Very misleading,"This product description is very misleading. The description specifically says LOCKS (plural), assorted colors, 1-pack. I took this to be 1-pack of assorted color locks.I recieved ONE lock. After checking this description again, I see that at the very bottom...................scroll down real far, the Product Description states that this item is ""1 color randomly selected at the time of shipment"".Very mis-leading."
2,Not the best lock,"I guess the rating really depends what you expect from this lock. If you need to keep something secure then look elsewhere. If you want to make something look like it's locked then this might do the trick. I didn't need much security for my purposes so this has worked fine for me so far, but I'm almost surprised at how flimsy it feels. I wish I had gotten something just a bit better because I think it would be worth it for the peace of mind."
3,"Cheap lock, low quality.","I got this lock for a storage locker. It doesn't seem to be as sturdy or heavy as I recall Master combination locks being back in the good-ole-days. Overall, it works fine and is cheap. I don't keep anything valuable in my storage locker, so I'm not too worried. If you actually want to keep something secure, get a different lock."
1,Not so good!,"I hated this lock! I went to high school and defiantly know how to use this tip of lock! But could not open it! I had my brother try and my dad, did not work! We googled it to make sure we were doing the combination correct we were!!! Still it did not open. I threw it away what a waste!"
1,Stopped working after a few uses,You get what you pay for. This lock started to get faulty after just a few uses. It would stop unlocking with the correct combination and I would find myself standing at the locker for 20 minutes trying to get to my stuff.
2,The Wheel Drags,"I've used this lock for about 3 months. The first time I used it I noticed that it was a little ""stiff"" when turning the wheel. The wheel seemed to drag as it was turned. About 1 month ago (after using it about 30 times on the locker at my gym) it became extermely hard to turn.....to the point that I thought that I would not be able to open it, but I finally did. I used silicone spray to lubricate it and it's doing much better now. But it's definitely a lower quality Combination Lock than Master has made in the past."
4,X-treme combination lock,"A good sturdy lock, but really just a regular combination lock in neat colors. Easy to do the combination and works great, and the color makes it stand out in the locker room."
3,Deadly Shaolin Longfist,"If you can get past the soap opera-type story plot, horrible acting, totally ""wack"" voice overdubs to some of the voices, flying 30 feet in the air after getting kicked, then you have a ""3-star"" type kung fu flick. I got this for less than a dollar so I'm not complaining at all. I would not pay no more than $2.00 for this one. Some of the scenes will have you cracking up. If you had a bad day and you need a good laugh - get this one! Some of the fighting scenes were ""off the hook."" This is basically the only reason I gave it 3 stars. Watch out for the dude with the pony-tail - he is no joke. His moves are totally real - absolutely no cut and paste jobs with this guy.If you get this flick, don't say you weren't warned."
3,Not a positive message,"I got this book for my son. We are a single parent house and I thought it would be a good book to discuss things that moms and sons do together for fun.Instead, the story basically is about the mom taking Critter to all these places and losing her temper with him bc he gets into mischief at each place.Yes, it ends with the typical ""I love you son"" ending, but all the pages before were rather discouraging.He has the Dad and me book and it talks about how him and his dad do things together and how he wants to be just like his dad. I had hoped this one would be similar - but definately not...Disappointed."
1,very disappointing,"We have several other critter books that our daughter just loves. This one however was very disappointing. This book has the little critter acting up and mis-behaving. This is very different from our other Mercer Mayer books where misfortune befalls our hero becuase he is a little boy being clumsy or because he is being 'helpful'. Reading a book which encourages the child to run away from his mom in crowded places, ignore rules and break things is not funny - it is just stupid. After two reads, we traded in our copy at the local used book store."
2,Not near as good as the Dad version,"As noted by others, this story features the main character getting into a lot of trouble. We bought it because we loved the ""dad"" version and we are very disappointed"
3,Not our favorite - but still read often,"This Little Critter book is a little less inviting than the others. Firstly, there is no cricket or spider to find - you find a frog. The pictures are great, but the dialogue is not as creative as some of the others. As a mommy, I was a little disappointed in ""my"" version of these books and find my son enjoys the Grandma and Dad books versions more - which I can see why. Still, it is in our collection and is the ""chosen"" bedtime story on occasion."
5,Incomparable,"I have tried lots of other resources including other audio programs, and nothing comes close. The program is virtually effortless and amazingly effective. I wish there were more programs in the series. As for the cost, here is my timeshare salesman pitch: calculate the difference in the cost per hour between this program and some cheaper alternative and compare it to the hidden cost of wasting an hour of your time on a less effective program."
2,Money and time poorly spent,"The reviews summarising this course are accurate.It is boring and repetative,unfortunately it does not repeat phrases and sentences that in my opinion are crucial to comprehending the language and speaking it.Accordingly one of its teaching devices is not fully utilised.It also has no ""solid blocks of speech"" that enable you to comprehend and learn.It is confusing in its use of future and past tenses.It is aimed at business,so,if you want to learn how to get about in Italy on holiday etc,its woeful.Believe me there are better ways to waste your money.Finally I believe the course would be incomprehensible if you had no prior knowledge of the language,unless you are a linguistic Mozart.Too expensive don't buy."
3,Information is great,"This book I was waiting for with great anticipation, after dog earing my Demetra George's book asteroid Goddess, I thought this was going to be a continuation of that one. Although a lot more practical than mythical it was brief at best. I was expecting more ""meat"" to this book and was disappointed in that aspect of the book.However, this book is great if your are needing meanings on the major asteroids in houses and signs, it can give you a wider perspective and for that I liked the book. Be forewarned! If you are an avid researching like myself, you can find this information on the web!"
5,Electrical Circuits,"I'm now retired and noticed that my knowledge of Electric Circuits had diminished over the years. This book is well written, covers a broad range of topics and has been a very good review. In fact, it cleared up an induction concept I must have missed during my Electromagnetism classes."
4,Works Well For A Variety Of Applications,"This half inch foam works well for a variety of applications as stated in other reviews!! Has a good adhesive backing that holds in place very well as long as mounting surface is clean!Used this foam in a small refurbished 3 way with side firing 8"" woofer to clean up muddy bass! Along with some acousta stuff/poly fill, the combination did a nice job of cleaning up the bass response for a very clean overall sound! This product comes in handy were 1 1/2"" acoustic foam or bigger just isnt practical due to space restrictions!"
3,One color not two.,"Color of product is grey, not two toned. Is light weight and easy to cut and use. Looks like good quality."
4,Worked for me.,"Did what I wanted, although I am not sure how much of the noise it really swallows up. I used it in a projector housing project."
3,Family Affair Series Set...,"I was very excited to get the series, and wanted to start watching right away....unfortunatly with the first disc I've put in, it skips!! I sure hope the rest of the discs aren't like that!"
5,nostalgic and wholesome,This DVD brought me back to the days when things were a lot simpler. It's a wonderful tool to teach young children values and manners which are so missing in our society today. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in wholesome and clean entertainment.
5,Classic and cool.,"A real treat for those who grew up in the late 1960s and 1970s. The coolness of NYC, the fashion of the day, as well as incredible acting talent from the whole cast make Family Affair a must own!"
5,Enjoyable show,I got season one and really enjoyed the story! When the box set came out I decided to just get them all. I really like what I've seen so far. I applaud how well they created and dealt with the issues the children had after first coming to live with their Uncle Bill. Realistic yet very lighthearted and funny!
2,Doesn't work in busy pharmacy,"I am a pharmacist and frequently have to open safety caps...hundreds of times per day, in fact. We tried this device and it was not suitable for our purpose. It may help with other types of caps but not the saftey caps we use."
5,A must have,"I have severe arthritis in both hands and opening bottles was impossible! I had a different brand of this kind of cap opener some years ago and I used it multiple times a day - and it made my life so much easier! Then - it disappeared and I went crazy trying to find the same one. Well, that wasn't to be found but when I saw this on Amazon I ordered 4 (to start). IT WORKS JUST AS WELL AS THE OLD ONE DID! Have now given them to friends who also cannot live without them now and will continue to order them to give to friends who need a little 'hand help'. I have not used them for prescription bottles but water/soda/salad dressing/etc. all open easily (and painlessly) using this little gadget."
3,child resentance cap opener,works okay on most caps helps give you a better grip but i am sure another product could be made to do the job easier and work on all caps. but my son is not for sale.
2,OK But does not last,This was a fine product...for about three months. It was very able to open bottles of water but after 3 months the insides were ground down to the point they could not provide the traction necessary to turn the tops.
2,Does not open all sizes,"They state on the ackage... Opens any size! Not true. It does not work on the Costco, Kirkland, water bottles. It does not grip. They skimped a little too much in the design."
3,POCKET VERSION,"This is the pocket version of the Franklin Covey Planner. It is listed on amazon twice, this listing and another which has a cheaper price! The suggested retail on this is really 69.95 NOT 99.95. The suggested retail listed for this item is for the compact version (a step up from this one)."
3,"It was a cool movie, but...",It was too long and I really didn't enjoy it as much as I though I would.
1,Worst film ive ever seen...,"I really didn't care for this movie in the slightest. To me it was just a bunch of people swearing and degrading themselfs. There were constant sex scenes which were really distasteful and it made me feel really depressed. I dont want to think badly of black people...it really made me sad to think that people might actually act in this way. I can see how this movie is attractive to some people, its all this hype about on the streets and living rough etc and it is one of those turn around movies but to me it was a pile of rubbish, sorry!"
3,Young and Dumb,"Big Ving and his green thumb women make this slice o' life from South Central watchable. Their wisdom, in stark contrast to Baby Boy's blinkerdom, rings out in a film that's too long, too scrubbed and way too sugar coated at the end. Fathom this: Baby Boy dodges his rival's (Snoop Dogg) caps, helps smoke the same dude, wins back his Baby Mama #1 after cheating and sponging without contrition and completely avoids any police murder investigation. Hmm, who had a motive? Guess the LAPD just wanted that skinny brutha dead as Hammer. Please. The expletive loaded exchanges between Baby Boy and his Baby Mamas entertain, but they're stagey and pretty unconvincing. ""I hate you!"" -- no she don't. Watch this Singleton joint for Ving. Recognize the grandeur of the Old Skool."
1,Be careful what you buy!!!!!,I purchased the product a few weeks ago for a coworker. I was highly disappointed when I found out the DVD was formatted for the UK. This DVD is now useless so I encourage anyone to read carefully what your about to purchase. Make sure is formatted for the USA.
5,Baby Boy growing up!!!,"Baby boy was a good movie because of alot of truth. The situation with Jody and his baby's momma has happened many times. All a girl wants is her man to be true. This is a story of a brotha who needed to grow up and realize what he was about to lose. It took alot for him to realize it, but he finally did and I personally thought the movie was GREAT. I highly recommend this film."
3,It Was Good!,I liked the movie and yes I did give it three stars because it's not one of those classic movies but it's more like you could just see it once and be satisfied.The plot was good and the characters were ok. The only part of the movie that I didn't like is Snoop's part it was just to unreal for me to take in. If it is on DVD then it's at least worth a rental but just pass on buying it. Peace out folks!
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MOVIE","I just saw this movie and I can't tell you just how disapointed I am with it. It was so bad, I feel asleep during part of it(and I saw it in the early afternoon!). The first hour of this movie was pointless and it had no plot. The writers never fully developed the story and never made us care about the characters. I couldn't care less if they all got killed. It wasn't sad, scary or romantic. Tyrese, Snoop and Ving Rhames did a great job considering what they had to work with, I don't blame them. This movie has nothing to do with the crtically acclaimed ""Boys in the Hood"", which it is often compared. This was a waste of [$] and of my precious time. I am writing this to save you the time, money and boredom associated with this film."
5,I LOVE THAT MOVIE& ITS THE TRUTH IN ALOT OF SITUATIONS,I WATCH IT ALOT. I SEEN ALOT OF BLACK WOMEN THAT WORK LIKE A SLAVE THEN LET THEIR BOYFRIEND/ HUSBAND DRIVE HER CAR LIKE IT IS HIS CAR.
4,"Baby Boy, True Movie","""Baby Boy"" is an exciting film filled with drama and romance, yet it has its moments where it had some sensitive content. Though it is one of my favorite movies it can be a bit stereotypical on young black men. This movie is about a misgudied 20 year year old who tries to juggle 2 kids by 2 different women and his mother's new boyfriend throughout the difficult times. Louisiane"
1,"Long, slow, dull","Probably the worst movie this year, this drivel makes the long, tedious scenes from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon look positively action-packed.What starts out with an interesting premise, that society shapes young black men to refuse maturity and responsibility, turns into the worst gangsta' crap produced in a long time, including the rite of passage when one of the baby boys kills a character and becomes a MAN. Shameless. Especially the hilarious scene when one baby boy accepts his pseudo step daddy's love when the boy hands over the pistol used to cut down the character. Apparently, the daddy, a one-time hoodlum himself, knows what to do with dirty pistols. It's a touching tampon moment... It's a complete waste of talent: Snoop Dog and Tyrese Gibson.Avoid the stench of this pile of crap at all costs. It should be sent directly to landfill..."
3,its alright,its aite movie but i wouldnt buy it just rent its only good to watch it once and gets borin after it.
3,Wasn't really impressed,"Although it got frustrating watching two characters who obviously love each other, not able to just love each other demonstrated good character developement, but it just wan't real enough for me. It seemed like in every scene there was a moral to be found which can get kind of annoying when you are force fed lessons supposed to be in the movie. The ending was too fairy-tale, not realistic at all 'cause you know Tyrese would have been sought after by Snoop's homies."
5,one of the most underrated films of the year,"Is it just me or was this one of the worst ad campaigns ever for an intelligent film that boasts not only Singleton's best character work to date, but two of the best female performances I've seen all year? Adrienne-Joi Johnson and Taraji P. Henson are simply amazing to watch. Of course, Ving Rhames is great although his later scenes are better than his initial ones. Tyrese is fine, no pun intended; some of my friends didn't want to see it because of him. Once they saw it, most of them said they were surprised he did so well. It's a tricky role to play but he pulls it off. A great movie, one of my favorites this year."
4,Everyone can identify!,"I have to admit, this movie is better than what I have expected. It was painfully true in some ways. Some say that it's stereotypical, but it really isn't. I've read some of the reviews and some think that it shows blacks in a negative light, but at the same time John Singleton is trying to educate these young people at the same time. He's trying to make them reevaluate themselves by basically seeing themselves in this film. I think everyone from different backgrounds can identify with the characters."
2,Strickly Fiction; Not For Home Use Please.....,"The movie was entertaining, and that's it. For those who experianced a moment of dejavu, well it's time to make some ""MAJOR"" changes.Ving was good and the music was great. NO not the rap selections featured on the soundtrack... The OLDIES! Now why didn't they make a soundtrack of those, it would have sold more copies, that's just my opinion.."
1,bad,"once again snoop movies continue to amaze me with their incredibly bad plots. For anyone who gave this more then a 3 stars get a life. Boyz n tha hood worked. Wanna know why because it had cube in it and singleton actually planned it out. This movie is typical of singletons work.my title sums this up.........at least ""bones"" ( the other snoop movie) was soooo dum it was funny. but this wasnt THAT dum. soo its not funny.which leaves it being, what was that word again, BAD."
1,This is a hot mess....,This is movie is terrible....I wish that I could get the two hours I wasted on this movie....I don't like it. And could we sprinkle a little more vile language though this. Jody....grow the....up! And stop having babies with everyone.
2,Exaggerated Ghettoism!,"The problem with this movie was that Singleton seemed like he was trying to make a ""ghetto"" movie. Yeah,you can find folks in the hood who talk and act like what you saw in the movie,but even they don't finish EVERY sentence with nigga. I never knew there were that many niggaz around. It's like Singleton just told everybody to just act ""ghetto"" when the cameras start rolling."
4,Let you child grow up,Single parents must allow their children to grow up. Caring for their daily tasks hinders the child from become an adult and being responsible. The child will stay under the roof of their parent without learning right from wrong because the parent is always covering up the child's mistakes or mishaps. This makes the child worthless for any type of relationship with the outside world.
4,Baby boy,"Movie was shipped in great shape, but it was not a special edition. It did not have some of the features I was looking for, but other than that a great buy!"
2,SOOOOO BORING,"ok dont bother with this DVD, the first scene is the best of the whole movie the rest is just kinda boring, i watched it with friends and it barely keept us entertained. It was a real let down... i now have it on DVD and will never watch it again. waste of money... nothing like Singletons other moviesDont bother ..."
5,Baby Boy,"I seen the movie Baby Boy, and it was real. I like that movie a lot when you go to the movies and watch it it's like you just want to go and the movie and just like try to help jodi out {tyrese} like his girl thought he was cheating but he wasn't and they kinda broke up and i wanted to go in the movie and be like no Evette he wasn't cheating. It was that good. So that's what I think of the movie."
2,"Sad, Sad, Sad","This movie is a sad illustration of many black brothers in America: lazy, displacing blame, and unable to love properly. Two children by two different women is drama. Why would you even want that? This movie is also a sad illustration of many of our sisters today. ""He beats on me, he cheats on me, he talks down to me, but he loves me."" ""He just going through some things."" Personally, Baby Boy was a little too ignorant for me. Ignorance was bliss throughout the entirety of the movie. I do think that Tyrese is a good actor though. I do appluad John Singleton for wanting to address this particular issue in society. I still think Boyz N' Tha Hood was his best movie. If you want to see every single negative stereotype a black person ever heard, then watch this movie. If you are tired of the typical African-American movie with it's stereotypes and unnecessary curse words in the place of the English language, then you probably need to watch something else."
4,What reviews I'm reading,"I read some of the reviews seem hostile towards the movie. I saw it on HBO and happens to like it. It's about an unemployed twenty-year old with two children living under his mother's roof. The movie is about growing up and learning from experience and what it means to be a real man. There are still some men over twenty, even thirty still trying to figure out what being a man is. Not to mention, there are brothas who just don't get what child support is (that also doesn't excuse sistas who think child support is supposed to be for their petty personal expense). John Singleton deserves to be praised for this movie he directed and wrote rather than be criticized. Nuff said!"
1,Willie Lynch Revised,"What point was John Singleton attempting to make in his movie Baby Boy?As an African American, I was appalled by the extremely foul language that was spoken as commonplace in the movie. It seemed that the funding must have come from White America because the negative stereotypical depiction of African Americans was overwhelmingly represented in the movie. If John wanted to do a porn movie then he should have used another avenue. What was the purpose for all of the sex scenes. What about the complexity of single parenthood and the chain reaction of out-of-wedlock marriages. John, please don't continue to insult us as a people or don't you realize that all African Americans don't live like thug lovin, underemployed or unemployed,drinking,smoking, sex-only driven, ex-convicts who lack effective parenting skills."
2,"Too brief, unexplanatory. Avoid using for teaching purposes","Explanations are often brief, making reference to other works rather than filling in the details. As a student, I've used it for several graduate courses, and have found a need to reference other books such as Siegman's ""Lasers"" in order to understand the material. This is a common reaction, based upon classmates. Derivations leave out numerous steps for brevity, sometimes crucial ones. Often states results from other works, without any explanation. It often seems a collection of material drawn from numerous sources, with little thought to connecting the ideas and notation into a teaching tool. May be more useful as a reference."
2,A good book only if you know the subject already,"I am extremely displeased with the experience of studying Quantum Electronics from this book. Its primary shortfall, given it was intended to achieve it, is its lack of explanatory notes and even more so the willingness of author to do it. It is difficult to explain my anger when following the text I would come across sudden results without any hint by the author as to its appearance except for a footnote referring to the original paper. I wish it would be a singularity here and there but unfortunately (for beginners) thats the order of the entire book.The book certainly might be useful to learned readers for reference or those who have Quantum Electronics the only course with lots of time to dig out archives of research journals to follow the ideas in the book. But for wayfarers getting to have their maiden sojourn at Quantum Electronics, I will emphatically recommend to set your hands on something else."
4,Great interview with Luther,It was really great to see this interview with Luther and how he came up with so of the most amazing music in the past 30 years or so. It was really a great history lesson.
2,"Ok, nothing special.","Amy Peppercorn is about a normal girl who suddenly becomes a pop star. The story is simple, easy to read. However, it isn't memorable- at all. Recommend to borrow from your local library-save your money."
5,handy for wetting or rinsing eyes,"These small, sterile saline bottles are perfect for travel or when you quickly need to rinse your eyes. Very nice product."
4,industrial size,"I don't know why the vials are so huge especially since they are single use. The vials are much much larger than any I have seen before. The case they arrive in is very large and heavy and is like something you would expect to see in a retail stockroom. The product itself is fine, just know what you are in for."
1,Unhappy,I was not happy with the product. I've worn this fragrance for 35 years and I'm very familiar with this product. Ill not order from this vendor again.ElGatoRojo
1,Sleepyeyed Mangrvove Throatwobbler,"Travelog compilation of listless new age synthorgan tracks sprinkled with indian chief warbling and birdie songs. The intent being to covey the ancient power of various sacred sites into your bedroom. The CD liner promices ""eternal thread of spirit that weaves through mankind"". The only spirit these dragging disconnected compositions evoke is the common spirit of sleep into your bedroom.... Oh don't forget the cricket chirps."
5,gift #1,Just what I wanted. Great service. We had been looking for this item and found the best price here. Received sign in time for gift to be given.
2,Fantasy Masquerading As Fact,"In this book, a Godseeking and gullible psychiatrist relates as truth his experiences of the miracles and presumed divinity of an Indian guru. Makes for interesting reading if treated as fiction. As fact, it is a bit hard to swallow in light of hundreds of accounts showing the Godman to be a charlaton. One is, even though disbelieving, amazed at the guru, Sai Baba's, ability to fool thousands for a lucrative existence in a poverty stricken area of India."
2,"Pretty boring, try a different Sai Baba intro book instead","Well I've read the first half of this book now, and I've got to say that it isn't as good as the Amazon reviews made it out to be. Or it just isn't what I was looking for. I'm interested in Sai Baba and I wanted a basic beginner's book explaining what he's all about. Instead, this is a book about an American psychiatrist in the 70s who was drawn toward Sai Baba, but resisted him at the same time because Sai Baba's teachings go against the basic principles of psychiatry. So it's a long-winded, at times psycho-babble filled, story of how the psychiatrist's fears were slowly put to rest. If I were a hyped-up 1970s American psychiatrist, this book would be perfect. But I don't have the same reservations about Sai Baba and I don't care about the psychiatrist, which makes this book fairly uncompelling."
1,worthless toy,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter to use at her slumber party. What a waste. I had to do most of the assembly, and even then they did not turn out. The material was very poor quality and did not even cover the braclets. The glue was useless and would not stick. This was a huge disappointment to all of us."
4,Great & Creepy,"The photos in this book are not images you want to put in your child's nusery, but they tell the story of animal extinction better than any post-card shot could. This book highlights the finality of extinction as well as the importance of natural history museums."
1,Perhaps she should live on an uninhabited island,"Rarely have I started a book with so much anticipation and been so disappointed. Ms. Birkett seems to understand very little about the Pitcairn Islanders, and about human foibles. Her paranoia, pettiness and lack of character destroy almost any credibility she tried to give this book."
1,Great idea that is executed surprisingly poorly,"What a tremendous tragedy that such a wonderful opportunity was wasted on a selfish, back-stabbing, childish writer.I was really looking forward to reading this book. In fact, after reading the first chapter, which is essentially a synopsis of the history of the Mutiny on the Bounty, I thought it was shaping up to be one of the finer books of the year. Unfortunately, after finishing it, I was absolutely disgusted with the author's self indulgence and lack of insight. Particularly appalling was her ""surprise"" that others on the island of 38 knew about her affair with one of the island's married men - this is after she had observed several times that there were no secrets on the tiny island."
1,Disappointment,"I was primed and ready when I started--What a great idea for a book, what a fascinating place, what gripping history. Little did I realize, however, that all this would become lost in the hands of one of the least insightful authors I've ever read. Having the emotional maturity of a newborn, she regards Pitcairn's inhabitants with little respect and seems to have arrived on the island with the sole purpose of indulging herself (and the expectation that everyone will likewise cater to her). What a shame that the unique opportunity granted Ms. Birkett was not put to better use. This really could have been a great book."
5,A fascinating read!!!!,"In my opinion, the critics above and below are being too hard and perhaps a little self righteous in their criticism of Dea Brikett's book.Her book provides a never before revealed insight into the culture of the people of Pitcairn Island, warts and all.There was more deceit on the part of the Pitcairner's towards her than there was on her part towards them. Far more.And yes, in a moment of weakness she slept with one of the married islanders. So what? It takes two to tango doesn't it?She is in my opinion a very gutsy lady who did her best to adapt to their very different culture. I could not put the book down."
1,Tabloid book reflects British Press very well,I love first person experiences but this one is silly and a waste of time. I finished with few of my basic questions answered and found better information on the net....free!I recommend you look there and forget this one.
3,Worthwhile Read,"Like many people I have found the story of the founding of Pitcairn Island fascinating and have always wondered about the descendents of the Bounty. Although somewhat gossipy in tone, I don't fault Ms. Birkett so very much. She is obviously not a trained observer of human nature. But she does bring us tales of a lifestyle completely unknown to most of us, and isn't that what a book should do, transport us beyond our own daily lives?"
1,A total waste of what could have been a fascinating subject.,"When I first saw this book on the shelf my thoughts were, ""Oh, this has got to be a good one!"". My first thought after reading it was that the title was most appropriate. I can only say that I was amazed by her lack of insight into & empathy for the islanders. The fact that she thought she could have an affair with a married man & not get found out shows her naivete & insensitivity toward such a small community. The saddest part of all is that she's probably ruined it for anyone else that may have wanted to spend some time on the island. They'll probably never trust another outsider & I wouldn't blame them."
1,Missed opportunity,"Sadly, a wonderful opportunity for a vivid description of this remote island and its inhabitants was missed. The reader received an unwanted play-by-play description of a visiting captain's ""pass"" at Ms. Birkett, but is left with many unanswered questions about what life is really like on Pitcairn. The school is mentioned, but what is it like? What do the children do there? In fact, little is said at all about the Pitcairn children--what do they do, how do they play? There was mention of a birthday party, but all that is described is the food and the hearty appetites with which the Pitcairners ate it. Simple but interesting things are omitted--do they bring presents? Where do the islanders bathe? As another reader asked, what do they do with their garbage? The writer was unfair and harsh in her descriptions of the hospitable islanders. This book is a big disappointment and not what the reader expects."
2,A surprising lack of insight.,"What's most remarkable about this book is its complete lack of insight into the minds of the islanders. What did they think of the outside world, viewed only through a VCR? Did they long to travel? What were the thoughts of the isladers who did go elsewhere (some traveled to the US and New Zealand)upon their return? How did they view the future, as their population dwindles?None of these questions are answered, or even brought up. What we're left with are the complaints of the author and some overly harsh portrayals of the islanders (Ms. Birkett recounts her initial meeting with her host, a kindly old woman named Irma Christian, by describing here as ""insectile"")This book represents a fascinating opportunity wasted."
2,"An Interesting Excursion to the ""End of the Earth""","I found this book neither as good nor as bad as the positive and negative reviews would suggest. It is, rather, a mildly interesting travelogue of the author's journey to what is one of the remotest islands on earth. Unlike many of the reviewers whose opinions are included here, I did not find the author to be an unscrupulous and condescending visitor to Pitcairn. But I did find the author to be a little insensitive to the wants and needs of others, and far too sensitive to what the Pitcairn islanders said and did in relation to her. Please don't allow the anti-author nonsense in some of the other reviews to dissuade you from reading this book --- if the subject matter is of interest to you. My 2-star rating is not meant in a negative fashion. This book was mildy interesting -- no more, no less."
4,Intriguing look at the idiosyncrasies of the Pitcariners.,"I really enjoyed the book, and can admire Dea Birkett's attempt at integrating herself in this closed society, but one does wonder why? She does seem to have respect for the Pitcariners, and does a wonderful job of detailing the idiosyncrasies of the island population and their language. However, after uncovering the dirty little secret of the younger crowd, she makes a concerted effort to ruin her creditability by having an affair with a married man. Puzzling!"
4,Good book on Remote Viewing,"I have read several books on remote viewing now. This one is a bit dated now, but the information in the book still matches the material in the newer books. The authors of this book are the ""fathers"" of remote viewing. You do not have to spend a fortune learning remote viewing. You can pick this book up for next to nothing and have a very good grasp on what remote viewing is and how to practice it. It will tell you what remote viewing is and more importantly what remote viewing is NOT. They give very easy to follow instructions on how to begin to learn this skill. So far this was one of my favorite books on this topic. I would definitely recommend it."
1,Does NOT work on soda cans,"Maybe this thing works for soup cans with pop tops, but it is a complete bust for soft drink cans. What a waste of money....I would return it but it isn't worth my time and effort to do so. Just threw the stupid thing away."
5,Ring Pull,"I bought this for my husband, he has diabetic neuropathy in his hands and can no longer pull the ring off a can.If he want something when no one is around he has to wait.No longer!Since we bought the ring pull he can open any can at any time!This is a great product.I even use it to keep from breaking my fingernail.It does it all.It pops the top and pulls off the ring then you eat or whatever.Thanks Amazon for great products!"
4,Feedback,"Works well. Got item promptly. Would have rather had the one made my Campbells, but could not find it. May not be marketed anymore.Thanks,bobC"
3,WISHY WASHY is all this book talks about.,"This book is ok. Through out the whole book they talk about how their opinions are wishy-washy. They never give a clear answer and are very unsure about giving you a definite answer. They leave out important formulas about calories and many other things. Not a terrible book but not a good one either. Maybe very confusing for some and lacks any backbone or definite answers. Some of the stuff in this book has been proven bad or even good for you, but they say the opposite. There is no fight preparation diet plans or any true relevance to Fighting. Would not recommend you buy."
3,Not Paleo Friendly,"While Mr Christensen and his co-author are clearly accomplished Martial Artists, their dietary advice is not consistent with the advice of Mark Sisson, Robb Wolf, Loren Cordain, etc. They also consider low-carb diets to be bad for the Martial Artist, and are ""fat phobic"" without getting into the (real) difference between good and bad fats.I think it is becoming clear, that there is a place for a low-carb regimen, even for athletes, as long as it is done with the correct types of carbs, and meal-timing is taken into consideration. Perhaps the authors don't agree with the Paleo philosophy, and that's fine. This is simply a warning to those who may be following the Paleo lifestyle, as this book will not add anything to their knowledge of diet in my opinion.I am not accomplished in weight lifting, so I can not speak to their expertise in this area, but chances are, it is better than their dietary advice."
4,Good basic book,"OK, since my job involves researching obesity I may have erred on buying this book. It is very good, at laying out the basics of nutrition and training. A lot of the training tips should be coming from your teacher, but nobody knows everything and this can help fill in the gaps. As for the nutrition, it may have helped to provide a little more in the way of practical application, but overall it is solid and the underlying principles are well set. Using this book will likely help the majority of people who are serious about training in martial arts as athletes to achieve their goal. Think of it as a mens health guide to martial arts training"
2,Light overview,"There's a lot of fluff and useless opinions littered through out the book. Some references to researched material were made but the author didn't expand on them too much. For a person who had never done any reading on this subject matter will find this very easy to read and will have a general understand of what book they should buy next :). For the rest of us that demand more, this book doesn't cut it."
2,"OK, but meant for martial arts competitors only","So much of this book is dedicated to competition. The exercises given are pretty basic, a few new and interesting ideas, nothing tremendous or special. I've read through it cover to cover and while the writing is entertaining it just wasn't suited for me personally. I was looking for more extensive and dynamic exercises, ways to improve all around performance that I wouldn't see other places. This book gives you ideas and tips on improving your performance, but they are run of the mill ideas that you would get from an averagely knowledgeable person."
5,Eat proper & Drink your Green Tea,"In brief... this is a fabulous book on nutrition and probably the best book you'll find with nutrition in the context of martial arts. All those little nutrition rumors are dispelled and in their place, this book gives you the facts on nutrition for martial arts (or just about any fitness training).Before reading this book, I didn't know a carb from a hole in the ground.The proof is in the result. All aspects of my martial arts training have improved by watching my diet and I feel even better than I did before!This book is a MUST HAVE!!!"
4,Success Indeed,I work for a real estate firm that is small in number of staff but not in volume of business. The company manages real estate in different parts of the country through subsidiaries and independent contractors. The tools in this book really helped me predict behavior - even over the phone of the staff and outside vendors I have to deal with daily. I am amazed daily how the information in this not very large book really makes a difference. Not only am I more efficient - I'm less crazed. And that's way more important - less stress at work definitiely means a better quality down time!! I think that Stan Dubin has done a real service to the small business. But do not just take my anonymous word for it - the book is inexpensive enough - check it out your self. I will be shocked if it does not help you.
5,Morning news!,I started reading this with my coffee every morning instead of the news. Incredable easy to read and apply data that changes the way you live your life. What an adventure. One of the best books I have ever read.
4,good but dated,"This is a good book for some of horse basics, but be aware that a lot of the information is dated (no surprise in a book decades old). Good for info on tack and breeds (except for the pinto/paint topic), but not so much for horsemanship or training. For those topics, I recommend the much more current books from Western Horseman (available on Amazon, too)."
2,Functional with questionable design,"The Master Lock Bike Rack for four bikes works but it is a cheap and poor design. The bikes are held on by a separate piece of metal with padding that bolts on to the rack. Every time you need to mount or dismount the bikes, you need to spin off three bolts rather than a clamp or even two bolts. Three bolts would be fine if I were a Martian with three appendages with opposing thumbs but with two paws I can only turn two at a time and have to constantly switch bolts. The second complaint is that the reciever hitch part is too loose and wobbles in the hitch. For the price it is a good idea to dig deep and pay a little bit more for a more convienient model."
2,Very Iimited insight,You would think from what Marilyn thought of Norman Rosten that this would be a very insightful book. But it's not. Perhaps because it was written only a few years after her death he didn't want to reveal much. If it's available for $2 or less maybe...
5,One of the best ever!!,"This is one of the few books I remember from childhood, and now that I am a parent I had to get it for my kids too!"
2,The Elephant and the Bad Baby,"According to the description it was a hard copy of the book. However, it turned out to be a boardbook. Very disappointing."
5,A good gift,The book was great. It made an excellent gift for my wife who is interested in passing along family recipes. The delivery was prompt as well.
2,Odor was the problem,"I love the receipe book - that's why I wanted another one - to share with a family member. When I received the book it was in shrink wrap. When I opened it, it smelled old and musty. I still have it in a ziplock with dryer sheets trying to get rid of the musty smell. I've only kept it because I had trouble locating it, and didn't feel that I would have another chance to get another one.Product - great; condition - poor."
4,So handy and very useful for all cooks new and old!,"This book is divided into several catagories of kitchen needs and recipe types ie. casserole, BBQ and etc. This book is wirebound and cardboard with laminated tabs for dividers. It would be great for any new bride to add new receipes to easily or for the more experienced can write the favorite ones down to share with family and friends."
4,Simple to understand,"It had a old school feel to it but doesnt take away the over all value to the book! Some people were up set that its missing letters but it goes by over all items not letter. It's pastrys,meats,seafood ect why they put letters at all im unsure. The pages are thicker paper which is nice and theres good spaceing I had no problem writeing mine in. I would recommend this to anyone!"
4,great to pass on,"Realizing that most people just use the internet for recipes these days, I love the pen and paper approach for things like this. I keep tried and true recipes in this book and I love the personalizing it allows. My only small complaint is that I wish there were some other cover/style designs available for those of us less ""country or victorian"". I hope to fill it up over time, and maybe pass it along someday."
5,Very nice old school recipe book,I bought this for my grandmother because it had a VERY old timey/antique feel to it and I just loved it. When my grandmother received this book she absolutely loved it. Great buy!
2,"COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHIN', BUT ENDED UP BEING NOTHIN'...","We've seen the story before, but for some reason it's always great to watch: nerds in high school battered & abused by their popular classmates seek revenge to teach them all a lesson...in grisly ways! However, this movie turns out to be nothing special. The only twist is it actually sort of defends the popular ""victims"" instead of the nerds they abused. Pretty odd, since most similar movies always root for the underdogs. Despite the nerds planning out some pretty great torture treatments with a grand finale, it ends with them realizing they're being too ""brutal"" and attempting to end the cycle of violence. Gag! The only upside: one of the main nerds is from DeGrassi, the Canadian TV show. So, that's about the only positive here. To sum it all up: if you like cheering the high school sad sacks on in movies and seeing the mean pretty people suffer...then skip this preachy movie."
2,Great story but poor execution,"The story is very realistic and you really sympathize with the characters that were bullied. Unfortunately the middle part of the movie fell quite below average. When I say middle I mean basically 80% of the movie. I was sitting there thinking ""what the hell is going on"" several times during some of scenes. To some degree I was thinking ""that doesn't seem that bad"" but maybe my mind is just much sicker than the director. Also, the acting for MOST of the characters was also pretty bad making a lot of the scenes seem less believable. That said, it does end the movie fairly well.To some it up, start and end is good. Middle is bad due to poor execution on both acting and not so interesting scenes."
5,Tourtured souls,"After Dark delivers the type of movie for those who have been stepped on. It tells the story of outcast kids at a high school who plan out revenge on their torturers, bringing them to a deserted ranch for what they think is a party. But when they awake from the drugs there given their placed into a nightmare, and made to suffer as they made them suffer. One of them is left in a wheelchair for the rest of his life, a girl losses her fingers on one hand and her face is scarred for life. One boy manages to get free and gets help from a neighbor who served in the Vietnam war, calls the police and the remaining outcasts committ suicide to avoid prison. The movie closes with the girl with the scarred face trying to live her life and discovering that this was what her victim was trying to do, and its next to impossible for her now as it was for her. A good independant horror film to have."
1,Really?,"Ridiculous. The acting was way over the top, the punishments were vague and ill placed. There wasn't really a lasting impression made, on anyone. I finished this movie feeling disappointed for the outcasts and for myself for wasting 90 minutes of my life on this movie."
1,Give me my time back...,"EVERYTHING about this ""film"" screams amateur at the top of it's lungs. The concept is intriguing, but the execution could not have been worse. It must have been slim pickings at the After Dark submissions office for this turd to sneak through the cracks."
1,Not scary at all and not bloody enough,"This felt more like a drama than a horror movie.There was only one scene where body parts were actually cut off and it was very fake. It was the finger scene and it looked like carrots being cut.There wasn't enough blood or .. well... horror.The movie felt like it was censored for broadcast television. Sort of like those old A-team shows where there's lots of bullets flying but nobody is ever shown injured or dying. I didn't see anyone die in this film. Even when people were shot, it was done outside of the view of the camera. Lame!And whats up with that 1970's jalopie police car? I know budgets have been cut but that's ridiculous. They could have spent an extra $500 and bought a modern car model to use. Attention to detail?I knew this wasn't going to go well in the opening scene when the supposed high school students looked like they were all in their 30s."
2,DISH SERVED COLD,"Revenge forms the core of this brutal film. ""Different"" teens who have been bullied all their lives turn the tables on their persecutors. As a film out to explore the psyches of all the teens involved, there is a certain pleasure in seeing the jocks and the ""mean girls"" blubbering for mercy. But the vengeance is so brutally served, it makes the nerds more despicable than the bullies. Isn't it possible that Dane and company are just psychotics using bullying as an excuse for their own failings? Victims are only victims because they allow it and blame society for ""failing"" them.The movies is effective but has some plot holes and its tortures ultimately empty and unjustified. Horrorfest 4 is not very impressive this year."
3,it was just ok,Thought it was going to be much scarier considering the picture and previews shown. More hype than anything else. Worth giving it a look though
1,WEAK.....,"Overall I think the one thing that really killed this movie was weak acting. A bunch of amateurs killed a potentially awesome movie. Well, I'm disappointed. I'm a little over a half ways through and I think I just want to skip to the last few parts, it's just too weak to watch. It was laughable and pathetic.Was it seriously hard to guess who the bad guys were from the victims' point of view? I mean seriously, they did drop some major hints. Finally when the person finally showed his face to them, the guy's like ""you....."" Uh yeah dude get a clue all that pot killed all of his brain cells or something? Man...."
2,"Too, too small","Very disappointed they didn't fit, the shoes look great, the style was very chic, unfortunately I should've ordered 1 or 2 sizes bigger. I had to return them, my toes couldn't take the pressure."
1,Awful selective color photos instead of black/white in paperback,"I had the hardcover edition and just loved it. Beautiful photos (black and white) and just very neat overall.As a gift to clients, I ordered the paperback version of this book. Well, the photos in this edition are no longer black and white. They've been edited with some cheap looking Warhol treatment and selective color ... just awful. I returned every single one and will be ordering the (twice as expensive) hardcover instead."
5,Friends to the End: The True Value of Friendship,It came in great condition and I'm sure both of the friends that I got it for will enjoy it.
5,Great Gift,"I gave this gift to several close friends for X-Mas, and they loved it. Everyone is leaving it on their coffee table for visitors to read. I received them in a timely manner and in good condition."
5,FRIENDS TO THE END,This is a wonderful and heartfelt book.The wording and the photographs were exactly what I was looking for.
5,"Sober, serious, thoughtful, and inspirational reading","A Matter Of Life And Death: Preaching At Funerals by Episcopal priest Charles Hoffacker is a heartfelt testimony written especially for Christian ministers who are called upon to speak to and comfort the friends and family of the deceased. Offering guidelines for speeches that celebrate resurrection and eternal life through Jesus Christ, A Matter of Life and Death: Preaching at Funerals is recommended a sober, serious, thoughtful, and inspirational reading."
4,Concise and informative,Robert Payne has produce a short history of the Broke dinasty in Sarawak (in todays Malaysian part of Borneo). The book in a concise and complete manner narrates the events that took place since James Broke first set his feet in the island of Borneo in the mid-XIX until the territory joined the Malaysian Federation after World War II.The story is fascinating enough and Payne simply states general facts in quite a neutral manner. Maybe the book lacks some footnotes and references but is well written and clear. A few photos (not as many as it would be desired) complete the text
4,Higher expectation than I thought....,"Well, when an artist releases a debut album, he wants to introduce his ""Sound"", then, the second one is to set what he has been done and make it better, not in this case, I felt a little disappointed (just a little...)in this The Raging Fire, less ""rest-songs"", less invited guests, less inspired melodies, the best ones are The Sun Will Rise and the hit Always From the Heart, the first one is still a ""Classic"", if you like it, you can also get ""Power from Kansas"", which is costing a budget around, if you wanna have this Raging Fire, go for US edition, which comes with an extra song, I bought the imported and missed it....(but I'll buy the US Ed. later, when the price falls down down down...eh-eh-eh...)"
2,"Billy, What happened?","I expected more from this CD. The only good song is ""You cross the line"". As another fan wrote, the rest is just filler music. The only positive thing to say about this CD is it's better than the first, which is not saying much. Billy, maybe you need to go back to ""Kansas""."
2,BILLY DON'T BE A HERO !,"RAGING 80'S REHASH.....GET BACK WITH KANSAS AND WRITE SOME NEW MUSIC....PLEASE MAKE IT BE GREAT LIKE POWER, SPIRIT OF THINGS, AND FREAKS OF NATURE AND WHILE YOUR AT IT THROW IN A LITTLE OF SOMEWHERE TO ELSEWHERE SPIRIT....FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO DANGLE WITH THE HAIR BAND INFLUENCED MUSIC THIS ALBUM IS IT...THOSE WHO EXPECT PROGRESSIVE MIGHT CRY AFTER HEARING THESE HAIRY TUNES."
5,THE UNSEEN HAND!,"This is an excellent book not only on George W.H Bush, but also if u want to understand the way the world turn."
3,It's a hit piece...,"You could give this author a poem about sunshine, flowers and puppies and he could interpret death and sex from it... but it's the only way you are going to get facts on the Bush's, and they are an interesting bunch. I do agree with the ""wolves in sheep's clothing"" assessment by another reviewer... I'd say the author is a Marxist really... or just rabid to find things to say.. he talks about how Bush set up an oil deal to avoid an 85% tax rate [legally] as ""depriving all of us of our fair share of taxes"" or something to that effect... I'd had enough at that point and took the book back to the library...."
1,are they kidding?,"It is hard to take a book like this seriously. When the authors were not caustic, they were snide, and when not snide, juvenile. I know nothing about the authors but I suspect they they wrote this for sales alone; the presentation of information may or may not be true. No serious author is as unremittingly nasty as these two. And no one escapes their contempt. Save your money"
5,Eye-Opening Even For Those With Eyes Open,"This book weaves a tale that will make you want to hurl. It's most interesting part to me was the early history involving Bush's father Prescott. Prescott Bush was President of several banks including Brown Brothers Harriman a bank controlled by his fellow Skull and Bonesman Averell Harriman. They and their attorneys, the Dulles brothers, were twice found guilty of trading with the Nazis during World War II and narrowly avoided prosecution for treason when they tried to funnel secret patents to the Nazis.There is SO much more and none of it will make you any more fond of the Bush family or the CIA."
5,A MUST Read: To Understand the Danger America Faces,"This book details the criminal past & Nazi, Eugenic philosophy that Permeates the Bush Family & contacts.There is a reason that this book is not available .... The powers that be do not wantyou to read it. It is available at several sites on the Internet for free download however. Search by Book name .... I have seen a few places.Read this so you knw why 9/11 happened and how the Bush's & CIA (shadow government) plan to use 9/11 to turn Amerika intoo a police state."
5,Deep Night Music,"What a shame that track # 4 isn't on the sampling list. That one track takes my mind on a journey(to WHEREVER! ) every time I hear it. This CD explores musical realms that transport.....PERIOD! Primordial, layered, tranquil, morphing, and on and on and on..I find the CD always taking me to different destinations. But believe me, track 4(The Grotto of Time Lost) with it's cavewater glurping and timeless spacedrift drone is ideal night music, right up there with Jonn Serrie and Raphael(more beautiful ""night music""). Track 4 alone makes me give the CD 5 stars!"
3,I don't understand the hype,"I love ambient music.I read the reviews.I purchased the mp3 album.And I honestly can say that I don't get all the hype.It's a solid album, but I haven't listened to it more than a few times. I guess it's because the tracks on the album are so different. I am used to an album having a certain feel all throughout. This album has all sorts of songs that make you feel different ways.I like the album, but it's nothing to brag about."
4,Excellent,"This man sits in a very unique academic niche that has served him well. The insights given here are profoundly helpful. If you would like an introduction to this man's writing I would rather recommend 'Jesus through middle eastern eyes' as it is broader. But then this early book goes deeper into Luke 15. I once used material from this book in preaching a weekend church retreat on the parables, and many people told me it was the best retreat the church had had in its 25 year history. If you want to grow in getting to grips with the literary genre of parable, you need a depth of cultural insight that is beyond most of us. This book helps immeasurably to close that shortfall."
2,Doesn't fit,"And yes, I ordered the correct size for my hitch except that the device does not allow for the size lip that is on my hitch."
2,Limited hitches it will fit,"Doesn't have a chance of fitting the square hitch on my boat trailer. It might fit on my car hauler, but I'm doubting that as well (have no reason to try it; this was purchased for travel purposes). Had I known it only fit certain tyles of hitches I wouldn't have bought it."
3,It's OK,"This is just one of those spinning lights that you would get at a live Spongebob show. Granted, it was much cheaper on Amazon but that's all it is. I'm planning on using it as a stocking stuffer at X-Mas this year..."
5,A very convenient package,Excellent assortment of bungee cords and a great way to keep them organized to have handy for needs as they arise.
4,Strong Straps!,"THE BUNGEE CORDS ARE VERY STRONG AND COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES, EVEN VERY SMALL. I GAVE TWO OF THEM TO MY NIECE FOR HER CAR. THE HOLDER IS ALSO VERY NICE."
5,Excellent Inexpensive Collection,"Everyone faces challenges solved completely or partially by bungee cords. If you have them when you need them then you have moved forward. I have had this collection for over a year and again this morning was grateful for the ability to check several different lengths for the best fit. The set is very reasonably priced. In fact, I came back to buy a second set and decided to share my opinion since I have benefited so much from those shared by others."
3,"Master Lock 3041DAT SteelCor Bungee Cords with Organizer, 10-Pack","Great but not very stretchy, especially in cold, unlike regular bungees, I do like the hook, easier to put on rack of honda 300"
4,GREAT WORKMANSHIP,THE STRAPS ARE VERY GOOD QUALITY. THE HOLDER KEEPS YOU FROM FIGHTING WITH TANGLED STRAPS.
3,"OK duty, but not heavy-duty","You can't tell from Amazon's pix, but the hooks are light duty (Skinny). They don't look or feel like they will hold-up to any heavy use or strain. These are OK to strap down light loads to a cooler like a sleeping bag or similar. But if you challenge them with anything heavier, the plastic hooks will likely deform and release."
4,"Master Lock 3041DAT SteelCor Bungee Cords with Organizer, 10-Pack","Fast shipping, lots of locks with little price, just wish they could be a little bit longer."
1,R2D2 is easier to understand,"I was so dissapointed by this product. I had hoped to use it to identify and translate Japanses words and practice pronouncing them correctly.It takes many steps to do simple translations. This was frustrating in a relaxed atmopshere. It would be near impossible underpressure.When you press for the talking translation it sounds like a tired robot in a large can. Extremely difficult to identify what it is saying let alone try and duplicate it.The other deal breaker was it only uses batteries. There is no way to charge it when not in use. You would need to carry around a case of batteries while traveling in order to use it throughout a trip.The size was compact and light, that was a nice feature."
3,does what it says,My wife is German and I am learning polish. This model had the most words out of the others that I researched for the price. Once you put an hour or two in on the manual usage becomes easy.
2,Keep Trying,"I bought the Ectaco Partner XL with high hopes it would help me in my Arabic class. My Arabic professor asked me where I got my translations for some of the words because they were not correct. I have found some of the translations useful, but for the most part, incorrect. I contacted the Ectaco and was told that if I wanted Arabic translation I should have bought just the Arabic-English Electric Dictionary instead of one with many languages. I'm hoping the translations for the other languages work better than the Arabic."
5,Get yourself ready...,"Call in sick to work, take the phone off the hook and take a seat for a super thrill-ride of a novel. John Passarella is a writer to watch! All three Wendy Ward novels will not disappoint!"
2,"Almost perfect, except for one gigantic flaw.","The cable that runs between the L and R earphones develops an intermittent connection within weeks of purchase or repair. I own 4 pairs and they're all bad at the moment! I've spent over $60 getting these repaired over and over again but they continue to go bad. It doesn't matter how durable and solid the construction is if you use a poor quality cable. I never used to have a problem with the cable, just in the last 2-3 years or so since they switched from a glossy cable to a matte cable. Surely I'm not the only one with this issue. In any case I'll be selling mine after getting them repaired again."
3,Where's the Bass?,"I'm a bit of an audiophile, and I imagined that these headphones would have a markedly superior frequency response to my current headphones, but they really don't. The bass on these headphones is almost non-existent. Mid and high frequencies are really tight, but the bass is strangely very attenuated, and there are no methods of changing the frequency response on them. Add that to the neck strain that you'll get after 20 minutes or so of using them, and it really seems like they were a waste of money."
2,Buying Koss Because All Others Break,"I am tired of the headphones I have bought at RadioShack; they break quickly or stop working. I read the reviews here in Amazon that say that the Koss last and although they may be heavy, that's OK as I only use them to listen to subliminal tapes when I go to sleep. I will update this review with more info ater I receive the headphones and have used them for a while.Well I got the headphones but because it does not come with the adapter for Stereos or MP3 player I have to go buy it %$%$%#.11/27/2007 update. Good headphones, I wish I could update the rating to 4 starts"
2,Bring on the memories,"The comments about when the dorm stereos were the equivalent of today's computers and ruled the dorms really jogged some memories. I actually spent most of my ""dorm time"" time in an apt but I had the Crown (IC-150/D40), JBL Studio Monitors (Century 100s) and, of course, the Koss Pro 4AAs (believe that I bought them at the Frankfurt/M Main PX when in Germany). As far as the weight, they really felt light when compared with my other set - which came with a ""commo"" helment and were attached to either a M-48A5 or M60A1 Main Battle Tank!Speaking of the JBL 100s, anyone know where I can get the egg crate grills? Too much Zepplin has long blown the originals away..."
3,My two cents on the Koss Pro-4AA Stereophones,"I originally chose the Koss Pro-4AA stereophones because of the great price and the large frequency range. Now that I use them every day in my home studio, I thought someone might be interested in why I only gave it 3 stars out of 5. First, the headphones need adjusting every time you put them on. As soon as you set them down, they revert to their maximum setting. Second, they are not as comfortable as they look. I can't wear these for more than 15-20 minutes before having to take them off. When you're working in the studio and recording vocals, often with multiple takes, these two together becomes rather tiresome. Also, I have never used the provided microphone mount. One good thing about these headphones is that the sound doesn't ""bleed"" through as long as the external speaker levels are not too high."
4,KOSS PRO-4AA Headphones,"One week after receipt, the left ear phone of the KOSS PRO-4AA audio was intermittent. Moving my head and the headset brought back the sound. The plug into my entertainment box is secure. It could be the positioning of the cup on my ear being too senstive. I did not notify KOSS."
3,Not an audiophile pair of headphones,"I'm going to make this review short and simple.The Koss Pro-4aa headphones are not audiophile quality.These headphones have almost no bass to speak of, making your music sound a little dull.But they're good for voice, or some classical I suppose.Why do I like them?Because they have a neat retro look and they're only part of my collection.If you are on a budget and want a good pair of headphones, go buy the Sennheiser PX100."
2,They Should Sell These With Aspirin,"The sound from these circumaural headphones is superb; no surprise judging from its excellent impedence and sensitivy ratings. Unfortunately, these great features come at a hefty price: the weight. Wearing them feels like I have gallon of water strapped on top of my skull. Prolonged wearing gave me a headache-a shame because I really liked the sound."
1,Koss pro-4AA (new),"This item was sell as a ""new"" product, it was; brand new packaging, new headphone, Koss guaranty certificate everything is new without discussion but the big problem is that sound is really far away from ""vintage"" Koss pro4 AA sound, in addition the headphone doesn't hold on the head. It's a deception, I didn't return the item because shipping cost was not interesting. Prefer a good old second-hand even if you have to clean it and to make 2 or 3 welds."
3,Great Sound - But a Real Endurance Test,"I returned these headphones because even as good as the sound is, they are just too heavy and clumsy. If you turn your head you will feel them shift slightly due to thier bulk and weight. I was constantly fidgeting with the headband ajustment to try to get them tighter because they will work loose if you move. Also, if you don't have a full head of hair anymore this set will rest heavy where the headband contacts the top of the head. The sound is excellent, parlicularly if you have a powerful receiver to drive the Pro-4aa's. It's a shame Koss didn't pay more attention to comfort because what good is great sound if you can't keep the phones on your head?"
3,Slightly above average overall review.,After an extensive burn in period the bass reproduction is still very marginal. Otherwise they perform very well as a vocal monitor for recording and some instruments that encompass the upper frequency range will also be heard in great detail. I would not recommend these for general music listening as they lack lower bass response but they are built down right durable for professional recording purposes unless you are a bassist or percussionist.
5,"Great Headphones, Great Company","I bought my Koss Pro-4AA headphones around 40 years ago. They gave me excellent service for many years. Recently they started sounding a bit distorted and the ear cushions had hardened with age. For a mere $7.00, I sent them back to Koss and they replaced the drivers, ear cushions, headband cushion and the cord. How is that for customer service on a 40 year old product? And they sound great, just like they did when new. I obviously didn't buy them from Amazon as they weren't in existence back then but I believe I paid more than the current listed price. Can't go wrong with these headphones or with Koss."
4,I defy you to do better for the price.,"They are by far the best 'phones that I've ever owned. Contrary to some of the other reviews though, no decent sound card will have trouble driving them. Laptops and onboard AC97 devices need not apply, but these are not forgiving headphones, so you wouldn't want to hook them up to a bad output source anyway. My only complaint with these is that I've had to replace my Soundblaster Live! with a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz, as the previously inaudible flaws in the Soundblaster became very annoying."
5,the best ever,Now near 60... in the radio business for over 40 yearsI'm proud to say that those Koss cans still are the best!!! Young kids in the biz will never get it. Bought my first pair in 1970...those big heavy cans still kick ass...might have a neck problem..and that right ear is starting to fade...still love those Pro4AA's
5,"drummers/bassists love it,heavy, uncomfy, and it works","awsome to see quality at this price.think drummers/ bass players in a live room, and then dont try these with anything eslse.these are hot and will make you sweaty, and these excel at thier job.every drummer bassist i have recorded with wants to buy them.... i tellem, amazon dude, amazon.your definately going to need an extension 1/4"" adapter /extender option that they sell, cord is not long enough IMHO."
2,Luftwaffe Victorious: An Alternate History,"Be warned: The title does not accurately represent the contents or the author's assessment of whether Germany could have won WWII. Want an informed well-researched theory on how Germany could have won if only Hitler (or someone else) had made a different decision at one key point or another? This isn't it! My biggest beef is with the title, because we're all free to envision alternative history as we wish, but the author's perspective seems to taint his assessment of the impact certain decisions and individuals could have had on the German war effort. Still, it isn't the worst book I've read on what the Germans could have/should have done."
5,"Hillary Duff rocks, so does this book","Hillary Duff does rock and this book does so aswell rock, i am a huge fan of Hillary Duff, and this is the best book ever written about her. It's easy to read too."
3,A Brief Glimse,"Although generally I am a fan of Bettina Rheims' photography I found that this book left me a little unsatified. The book does nicely demonstrate some of her work, but I felt it needed more. However, for someone who is after an idea of what Bettina Rheims has to offer, this is probably a great place to start.. especially considering the price."
3,Eventually Dr. Batra will be right,"Dr. Batra is a brilliant guy who tragicaly jumps to unwarranted conclusions. There was no Great Depression in 1990-1995. He should have called it quits there when he predicted that if a Great Depression did not materialize by the year 1995, then that window of vulnerability had shut. Batra's main problem consists of the fact that he does not factor human resilience and the ability to adapt into his economic equations. His most convincing argument to date (which he needs to develop) is his analysis of Free Trade (see ""The Myth of Free Trade""). It is convincing and (IF correct) portends bad times in the future. Unfortunately, he drops that analysis and is mesmerized into trying to predict millennial doom. Sadly, if he keeps predicting doom, and if he lives long enough, Dr. Batra will be correct. It's really a pity that a man of his intelligence doesn't use it to further our understanding of socio-economic dynamics."
1,More hysteria from Ravi Batra,"In case you don't know, Ravi Batra is also the author of ""The Great Depression of 1990."" I know what you're asking yourself: there was a depression in 1990? No, there wasn't. But Dr. Batra predicted one. Now, with ""Stock Market Crashes of 1998 and 1999,"" the arch doomsayer is at it again, predicting dire times ahead when any sensible person knows better. Batra doesn't know as much economics as even the average college undergraduate. He decries free trade as if he's utterly unaware of the benefits of a division of labor. (If protectionism between countries is good, what about between states? Or cities? Or people?) If you're interested in learning something about the economy, try ""The Myth of Rich and Poor"" by Cox and Alm. Down Batra's way only madness lies."
4,A eye opener.,"This book is very specific in dealing with harmonic extentions of chords. I wish I would have bought this as one of my first purchases of Jazz guitar books. It really makes a complex harmonic idea rather simple. Much like Joe Pass's idea of ""guitaristic shapes"" rather than advanced theory, it makes chord substitutions much easier because you use the same ""shape"" rather than having to learn every ""harmonic rule"". If you like Wes and Pat Martino, this book will make you happy. Much of their signature sounds are dealt with here. I love both the Wes and Pat transcription books, but this book let you know why it works and what framework they were working from."
2,no cd for kindle,"The book is great but if you get it for kindle there's no option for downloading the cd. It's a real shame because you don't get to mimic the timing of the phrasing, unless of course you are at a level where your reading of notation is good enough. Mines not. Anyway, that was my mistake - let the buyer beware. Beware."
4,Demystifies the jazz guitar style.,"As primarily a blues-rock player, I was always looking for a book that would allow me to capture the classic jazz style, without having to make a complete change to my playing style. This is the first book that has shown me how to do this.The book manages to do this without getting heavily academic either. This is what I most enjoy about the Berklee Press books, while it's obvious you are getting quality instruction, the writing style is very accessible to the non-academic while still remaining clear and concise.As a bonus, the examples used in the book can actually be used in a real-life gigging situation, rather than just being vehicles to show off the authors' ability, as is the case with many other ""name player"" books.I highly recommend this book for players of any level."
3,Melodic Approach not for beginners,"The good news is that ""Jazz Improvisation for Guitar-A Melodic Approach"" by G. Fewell is full of music examples which display the use of triads and their extensions. The not so good news is that this book is a Jazz licks book rather than how to book.The author assumes that the student will understand and quickly pick up all the concepts in the book.Chapter eight: ""Using Guide-tone Lines in Soloing"" is a useful chapter. But again, I think the author moves along to quickly. There aren't enough basic examples. More opportunities for the student to write their own examples so they could see and hear the triads on a simple level are needed. Of course the CD helps, but the student needs to be a good reader and already have a good jazz vocabulary to get the most from this book.If a beginner bought this book, I think he or she would save it for sometime down the road.The advanced player will get much more from this book."
2,not recomended,"didn't find the material in this book usefull for this time modern jazz playing.actually it is kind of full with un-helfull details that can only overload yourself while improvisinglots of music examples but most of the time, not something you would want to play.im sorry for buying this book."
1,Cheap!,In my opinion this book deal with the surface of a real basic concept in Jazz improvisation. Unfortunately the triadic concepte is hereexplained through really weak and cheap examples: there are few good lines transcripted from guitar masters but Fewell's example are for the most terrible!
3,refreshing new theme,"This is a futuristic novel about a man and woman who fall in love and celebrate the seasons with beautifully described sabbat ceremonies. The love story and other relationships are somewhat unrealistic and overly sweet at times. Otherwise, the writing style is pleasant and the paganism of the characters is well-described."
5,Enchanting ....,"Weaving an enchanting story, the writer leads you through the life of two young adults. Through their joys and sorrows, you experience their life almost first hand. I cried and laughed thoughout the book. Being Pagan, it touched me on a very spiritual level. I recommend this book highly to both Pagans and non-Pagans alike, for it will also touch you on a ""life"" level. It is a story of life, of dreams, of hopes, of trials... of love. A MUST read!!"
3,"Average compilation, some gems, some pits","It is just too bad that most short film compilations contain wide variance in quality. This selection is no better nor worse than most of the others. It seems the more shorts in a collection , the greater chance for mediocrity. But then this makes the gems pop out even brighter. This is definitely a collection worth seeing, even though some of the films are a little too long for short films. Of course, what constitutes good or bad is very subjective. For me, the short Boychick is probably the most charming of the bunch, and in a very short time with relatively little dialogue it can disarm the viewer. At the opposite end is the self-indulgent Rainbow Avenger. The rest fall somewhere in between. But don't take my word for it; get this collection if you collect gay films, or at least try to rent it. It is pretty much a miracle to get a gay film made and distributed, so show your support.And you're bound to find something to your liking."
1,Ugg. Don't Waste Your Time,"Sorry...five short films -- all either are, or seem like, student films...I'm sure these guys graduated -- everything is lit, the editing is orderly, the shots aren't sideways or misframed -- but that doesn't mean the films are worth seeing. Mostly terrible/dull. The best is just ""okay"".Obviously trading on the idea that gay men will watch anything that is gay themed. But there's nowhere NEAR enough sex or nudity or cute boys to make it worth helping to prove that point.The only amusing part is that the DVD actually contains director commentary tracks, like we need to hear stuff like ""this was really shot in my friend Jon's apartment"" or ""Okay, that neighbor woman is actually my sister, who volunteered to be in the film. She's really nice..."""
3,Average,I don't think this product is strong enough for KP. This works very well to soften hands and feet though.
1,Not for sensitive skin!,"I have red bumps on my arms from dry skin, forget the terminology right now. Tried using for 3 days and make my arms 200% worse. Just aweful. I was really hopeful about this to. Still trying to get my arms back to ""normal""."
5,Only product that helped with Retin-A dryness,"My dermatologist recommended this, to use on my face while I am on Retin-A. I've been on Retin-A several times in the past, and was always hesitent to use it because it causes my face to become dry and flakey. But I trusted her, and gave it a try.I use it reguarly, twice a day, along with the Retin-A once every day at night. And only a few times has my skin been flakey, and I've been on Retin-A for four months now! I've been using expensive moisturizers, and this is a bargain. It really works!"
1,Onholy Mess,"The Destroyer started in 1971 as an action series that had more going for it than any other series. I have been a devoted reader since the beginning but if I didn't know that next year Tor Books will be publishing The Destroyer then this horrid book would be the last one I would buy. This author started out with some promise but that promise died quickly. There is no Remo and Chiun in this book. There is a little Remo, less Chiun, and even less Smitty. The book is all about the bad guys and they are pathetic. If you are a completist then buy this book and the next one and then wait patiently for the return of the REAL Destroyer next April. Jim Mullaney and one of the series creators, Warren Murphy, have reclaimed control of the books from Gold Eagle and they promise to bring back the characters we have lived with for decades."
2,Onan would be proud,"I'll give this to David, he'll milk anything even his cancer if he thinks he can ring a few morsels of attention and applause out of it. And that is fine being entirely in his character to do so. I just wish he wouldn't deface Pascal in his attempts to decorate his self pitying navel. While Pascal does famously ask us to take a ""leap"" of faith that is hardly the equivalent of a ""leap"" into stupidity that is involved in David's worldview. As other reviewers have noted, David is a classic narcissist and I've always found his political evolution to be interesting from a psychological angle since it clearly isn't from an intellectual or moral level (unless you enjoy viewing the erosion of the latter). This isn't an entirely worthless book however, reading it did remind me of how finite life is and how many more things there are to do with the precious time we have than in reading mash notes a bitter man on the wrong side of history writes to himself."
3,Where Have the Unicorns Gone,I bought this book for my kindergarten daughter who loves unicorns. She is expecting a story and gets disappointed since there is no story line in this book.
1,"They ran away from people like YOU, of course","Oh, yawn.OK, we all get it. Civilization is bad. The world is dying and it's YOUR CHILD'S fault. All those triumphs of mankind that allow us to preserve beauty and private spaces, the technological advances that bring us the wealth to buy lovely picture books, the comforts and conveniences that give us time to relish evocative stories with our children? Those things are bad, Bad, BAD because they drove the unicorns away, and the unicorns are NEVER. COMING. BACK.Just another cheerful children's book."
2,Leaky diapers are a waste of money,The diapers leak if the child sits on the wet diaper. Impossible to go through the night without having to get up at least once to change the diaper. Otherwise the child will be soaking wet in the morning.
2,Huggies leak. Stick with LUVS,"If you are a new parent with your first child these are fine as you will probably change the babies diaper every 1 to 2 hours anyway. If you are like me with my third child you will just keep looking at them every once in a while for a saggy diaper or squeeze it for that mush feeling before you change them, then do yourself a favor, avoid these and buy LUVS. Huggies leak before they even get a chance to sag. LUVS are much cheaper and are twice the product that Huggies are."
4,Brings back memories...,"Miramax's Greatest Hits brought back famous moments from some of the best Miramax films. I loved the song from ""The Postman"". It is one of the most romantic songs I have ever heard. I also love the song from ""Cinema Paradisio"" because it brings back memories of the beautiful and melancholic scenes from the movie."
2,Didn't work like I expected...,"I chose this product thinking it would help with energy and constipation. I can't say it did either, plus the pills are very hard to swallow."
5,Great product!,"I found it takes about four to five days of consistent use to really feel the benefits. Helped my restless leg SO much, really a godsend. I take the dose spread out into three times (1/meal) that seems to avoid any stomach issues."
2,Front label misleading,I have been using this product for over 6 months. I will be leaving this product for something else. The value and quality is not in this product.
1,Disappointing.,"I bought this product along with Natural Calm (which I started with). the Natural Calm took care of my muscle cramps with one dose each day. When I ran out I started on the Magnesium Malate once a day, then twice a day... the cramps are returning along with restless legs at night, which I had forgotten about when I was taking Natural Calm.Don't bother with this one."
3,Should tell people that you need 3 tablets to get the 1250 mg,I was very displeased that the information shown was not accurate. You must take three tablets to get the amount of magnesium malate shown on the page. The person buying this product needs to be able to see the supplement facts. I could not find a way to see it.
4,Bought for Cramps,Stopped cramps really quickly. Just don't take too many too frequenly or you'll be trotting to the water closet. .
5,Cannot do without it!,"This Magnesium Malate has been a great product for me in treating Fibromyalgia...I take two of the 1250 mg. daily and it really does help......Although Amazon is a great product provider, I would recommend they find a different RX to obtain this product........waiting for 19 days to receive after ordering, I still did not receive and now waiting for my credit card statement to be sure I have received a credit."
5,PERFECT FOR TALL HORSES & SHORT PEOPLE,"This item is built sturdy, yet light weight. It's the perfect heigth for climbing on a bareback mount or even a saddled draft like my Percheron."
1,"Way Overpriced, many others available","I have nothing against this mounting block...but when you can find near identical products here for much much less there is no reason to buy this one. Also if you look on other sites... dover saddlery, state line tack, or smartpak as just three examples (and many of these also offer storage). Priced too high and definitely not the reasonable offer."
3,unscientific character sketch reveals undisciplined 'genius',"This easy to read book is one of the shortest life descriptions of Churchill there is. It's foreword already tells us that the focus will be on Winstons character, with his career only as background.If you keep that in mind, and don't expect details on his campaigns, government and financial policy, this is an interesting biography, that depicts Chutchill as a larger than life, somewhat unbalanced and egocentric bully, with some ideologies that on a closer look are a dubious mixture of conservatism and fascism. A man that fortunatly lived in the right time, when there was active need for such a man, to combat Hitler.The reason I only gave 3 stars for this book, is that I firmly believe that any biography should have footnotes and references to liturature, so that you can check some of the wrirters assumptions, esspecially if the focus is not on facts but on character, as is the case here and that this is completely missing here."
5,Encyclopedia Satanica,"Matt Schutt's should be required reading for every man, woman, and politician in the United States. He tackles the weighty issues such as abortion, gun control, government; meets them head on, and dares them to challenge. With cunning insight, outrageous humor, and something that is sadly lacking in our society today, and that is plain common sense. I wish that I had his ability and courage. Look out Michael Moore another Michigan boy is looking around in the corners and shaking the dust loose. Wonderful reading!!"
2,Not so good,I had this Edelbrock fuel filter for about 5 months now on my project car which I am almost finish rebuilding. I have notice little pieces of rust has been passing through and clogging up my carb. I have open and cleaned my Autolite 4100 carb twice already and still with the same problem. I might have gotten a bad filter but i doubt it.
3,Too big,"These are huge. I bought them as a present for my sister, and I came to realize that they were massive. They hardly fit in a standard drawer. Find something better for your purchase, with locking close, or smaller size, if all you want is universal kitchen tongs."
3,"not the best, but they do the job","These tongs are not the best tongs. They do not fold flat, and they do not have any springs or ways of adjusting how open they are for grabbing, or how closed they are for storage. They are also kind of big and bulky.I did however order these because they are a good brand and they are nylon to keep my pans from getting scratched up. As far as the quality, they are still working great. They do not scratch my pans and they have not melted. They are also easy to clean. I've had them about a year already, and I will probably have these for a long time seeing as they won't break any time soon."
3,"Not too bad, but not what I was hoping for...","I bought these tongs to use w/ my new Cuisinart stainless cookware. They are big and bulkier than I'd prefer, but are sturdy too.They don't open up very wide though and I'm a bit bummed on that. They feel like quality, but I wouldn't have bought these if I'd had a chance to try them out in person first."
1,Of limited use,"I was jazzed about these tongs as they are totally nylon - so no hot spots when in contact with liquids, etc. I was so dissappointed when I actually tried to grab something out of the pan and realized that they don't actually come in contact at the tip of the tong head, but instead only touched at the heal of the head, by where the plastic handle portion begins. Ugh! Not my definition of a tong. They now reside in my trash barrel."
2,Valuable information; poor presentation,"This is a pamphlet, not a book. It is stapled down the middle. Half the pages are filled with advice on relaxation -- about 7 lines per page.I think it would be worthwhile to study the techniques with the author, as they are rare and valuable, but if you are particular about how the books you buy are put together, get an actual look at it before you buy."
2,Cranoe,I did not enjoy this at all.The taste was too sour for me.I did not taste the aloe flavorjust not my palate.
3,Decent,"The game has a good start, but it's confusing sometimes and it doesn't explain things to much, its weird. Not what I expected......"
4,Light & delicate - but shy on honey,"This Supplier creates a pastry that looks impressive on the table and is light and fresh. It arrives fast, is well packaged and can be placed on the table minutes after receiving it. It is great for holiday times where there are lots of people coming & going (it is a rather large batch of baklava). It is not messy to eat - which for me is a draw back as it indicates less honey/syrup than I like in baklava.Maybe the baklava I was raised on in Chicago (sweet, gooey) was not authentic - but that is what sticks in my memory and this product is different than that. Not bad - just different. Maybe I don't want authentic..."
1,Don't Buy It,"Written by Jim H: The item arrived with numerous gouges in the wood that were stained / varnish over. Very poorly finished. The mounting system is inadequate and dangerous. Three screws with plastic inserts into the drywall to hold a 40 lb cabinet. The inserts pulled out of the drywall of course. Finally got it mounted using butterfly drywall screws, but it was a pain to do. I won't send it back because it would be too much trouble. Don't buy it."
4,"SEI Wall-Mount Jewelry Armoire with Mirror, Oak","She's a solid piece of carpentry. I would agree that the keys are pretty ugly, (a tassel and some nail polish should take care of that) . Yes, you do need better hardware than supplied. I tried hanging it myself, but as others have said, it's a two person job (waiting on my guy to show). I like it and would recommend the Armoire."
5,Beautiful piece!,"My husband purchased this for me for Christmas and I love it! I needed a place for my jewelry that I could easily access, but my kids could not.First, this is a solid and beautifully made piece. When closed, as a mirror, it is simply stunning on the wall. What I love the most is that my kids have not even questioned if there is something inside, and have not even attempted to open it.I love the locking mechanism. It keeps everything secure and safe from small hands.The inside is adequate space. I have a TON of jewelry and everything fit nicely."
5,Love It!,"This jewelry cabinet exceeded my expectations. It is well-constructed and quite a sturdy piece. It comes with two screws and those plastic wall anchors. It's heavy and will require 2 people to hang it, so if you're not mounting it in a wall stud, then I'd recommend using a sturdier wall anchor made of metal to ensure your purchase doesn't end up on the floor.Even though I was aware that it was 48"" tall, it was taller than I expected when I saw it in person. It's not too big, just bigger than I had imagined. The inside is lined with felt and is well-done. The cabinet locks if you desire to lock it. The mirror is nicely beveled. It holds many necklaces, rings, dangle earrings, and has a divided tray that sits in the bottom for small earrings and such. Overall, the jewelry cabinet is well-made and sturdy. I was definitely pleased with the purchase.You won't be disappointed."
3,not enough earring storage,"The jewelry box is very nice but I had to take it apart to add in more earring storage. There is also a very strong chemical smell when you open the box and its still there after leaving it open for a week. Had no problems mounting it to the wall. Once I reconfigured it, it works great!"
2,Looks nice- but broken,"Armoire looked great upon taking it out of the box, until I noticed the wood was split on the side. Unfortunately because I live by myself I needed help hanging it and had to wait for my dad to come over. It sat in my back room for a month before we took it out of the box and realized it was broken- my luck the return expiration was 3 days ago. It looks like it will still be functional, just doesn't actually look as nice. The box does not have any damage to it- so it was apparently broken before it was packaged. Doesn't make me want to buy anything from this company."
5,wife loves it,Ordered for my wife for Christmas. She couldn't wait for me to put it up. She has filled it with her jewelry already!
2,Disappointed,"Oak finish is beyond ""distressed."" It appears to have been made with damaged wood. Obvious nail holes in a 4 square pattern is not distressed, it's used in my opinion. There are also chips and scratches that are not stained. All of this on the face of the product. Would not recommend this unless you plan to place it inside a closet, or in an area that is not in plain sight."
5,A Great Accessory,"The Jewelry cabinet arrived earlier than expected, as is usually the case with Amazon. The quality of the cabinet is very good. Good joinery, clean and well fit interior with plenty of space for all our jewelry. Hanging the cabinet was a breeze, although the included wall inserts were lacking in quality. I installed other wall anchors and used a level. Overall, very happy."
2,"Like the product but given the fact there was a problem when opening it for ONLY THE SECOND TIME, doubt it will hold up.",When opening the door for ONLY the second time the screws on the hinge pulled right out of the wood (?) side so now only two of the 3 hinges are in tact. Of course the cost of shipping is too high to just mail it back and I'm not a carpenter or cabinet maker so I'm stuck with PAYING someone to fix it or live with a broken piece of ----Don't know why I should have expected anything different. Customer service and quality are quickly becoming a thing of the past in America.
4,my wife likes it.,my wife likes this product. i mounted it on the wall and so far it has worked ok. it matches the jewelry box that she has.
4,"Yes, there are previously unreleased versions of 3 songs","The versions of Burn, Stormbringer and Space Trucking on the Mark III The final Concerts set were taped in Graz. These versions were witheld originally due to ""recording flaws"". I guess now we can judge for ourselves how bad the flaws were.Personally, I wish this had been issued instead of The Final Concerts and either the complete Graz concerts issued or the Graz versions from The Final Concerts issued with the original Made In Europe versions- edits/ overdubs and all. Oh well. It's only money..."
1,"Old seeds, won't sprout","We recently started growing our own sprouts, and once we ran out of our initial seeds from the store we decided to buy a large pack to keep a steady supply going. I ordered these and they arrived quickly through Amazon Prime. We started a batch right away and 2 days later there has been no sign of any sprouting from even a single seed. You can usually see progress by the end of the first day! Checked the bag to see if there was a use by date on it. Sure enough, there was a ""best used by"" day, COVERED BY A STICKER!!, which when peeled back said 09/11. That was nearly a year ago! Maybe it was a fluke, but I'm returning them for a refund."
5,Lot of fresh sprouts!,I love sprouts! This bag will allow you to make an enormous amount of fresh sprouts. Start out with a very small amount of seeds! You will get more than expected.
4,Growing alfalfa seeds in a Sprouter,It's a great way to buy alfalfa seeds and watch them grow in a sprouter. And you can even eat them after 2-3 days.
5,excellent seeds,These are fast sprouting seeds and the germination rate is fantastic. I was surprised at how quickly they sprouted... the following day after I soaked them. Highly recommend them.
4,Informing Policy is more important than stealing secrets,"""It is not too gross an exaggeration that when considering any given threat, DIA will overestimate, CIA will underestimate, and INR will blame the U.S. for it."" From his opening chapter and his distinction between static, dynamic, and technical facts, on through a brilliant summary of the post-war spy on page 103 and lengthy sections on how we've gotten it wrong, how we can get it right, and what is needed in the way of reform, I found this book worthy of study. An analyst and political staffer by nature, the strength of this book rests on the premise in the title: that intelligence should be about informing policy, not about collecting secrets for secrets' sake."
2,No Weekend support,"The software is good, but everyone knows with such activation and deactivation issues, the company should be willing to provide around the clock support. Otherwise make the activation and deactivation process easier. In fact, you can't even deactivate from a computer without calling tech support. Once it is deactivated you can never install it to the deactivated computer again...ever!! How ridiculous!So if I'm in an emergency becuase my OS glitched & now I need to wipe out my Hard Drive just in order to USE the computer - well I have to wait to DEACTIVATE Rosetta Stone first b/c if I don't, I waste my activation slot. (Happened to me before with Rosetta).... But wait! I can't deactivate Rosetta Stone b/c I have to call Tech & no one is in till Monday! Now I'm screwed, b/c not only can't I deactivate, I can't fix my computer till Monday! What the world is supposed to stop b/c Rosetta Stone isn't in?!WARNING to Rosetta users: Don't let your hard drive crash on the weekend!"
1,I would never again buy this software.,"It's over-priced, non-intuitive, non-memorable, and the pictures/words used don't make sense in the Russian context. It has a bulky and slow navigation system which doesn't make any kind of sense. There's then all of the issues with activation and lack of support. Why buy Rosetta when there are SO MANY better options out there? Try Pimsleur, Linkword, Penguin's New Russian Course, RussianPod101, and Schaum's for grammar."
2,Forget support after purchase,Forget support after your purchase. My delimma: I installed this on a computer at home. I got rid of that computer. I wanted to install this on a new computer. The software blocked me because of the installation on the other computer. I called the company to ask them to deactivate the installation on the computer I got rid of and activate this one.But it was over the weekend. And technical support was closed. But guess what? Sales was open. Go figure. And of course there was nothing the sales guy could do to help me ... unless I wanted to buy another of their products.When do they expect people to use their software? Only during business hours? After the sale they're done.
2,Buy somewhere else,If you are looking for something authentic don't buy this. Dodger blue was used instead of Arizona blue and it doesn't look very good.
5,Delicious,"I bought one tray of these pasties hoping my to satisfy family's sweet tooth with something healthier than candy. These are exactly what I hoped. They are good and satisfying so we're happy to have them and we don't eat too much. Since these are made of nuts and honey, they are also more nutritious than the candy we are used to buying.This tray is a good sampler of the different items we can buy separately when we need more.I recommend this stuff. It would be a great tray to bring to a holiday party."
5,If you have to ask...,"you either didn't skate in the 80s, or didn't know anyone that did. I saw The Search For Animal Chin during it's first go in the 80s. I was thrilled to see old-school merchandise being reissued. This shirt receives either compliments (from those who know) or questions ranging from ""Who IS that?!"" to ""I hope you find your friend."""
1,Over priced and under performs,"I expected more from this given the high price and manufacturer's description.It has 2x 40 amp spst breakers; these are used to control the power to the fuse block...you won't be using these for accessories like one might expect. There are 7x 10 amp outputs, a major disappointment. 10 AMPS MAX!!! I don't expect 7 high outputs but you must give a few because the point of this product is upgrading your vehicle and a stereo amp will need 20-30 amps. The output wires are THIN. They are at most 16 gauge, possibly 18. The input wires might be 14 gauge tops. This is not a heavy duty product.The manufacturer needs to do a better job of providing an accurate description. I can't even use it. Worthless Wiring."
5,Just what the girls needed,"I got these for my girls to play with their dolls. The product is well made, fun and will last a good long time."
2,Like TV commercial music...its the Keys as a tourist brochure rather than a real place,"This music would be perfect as background to a TV commercial, so there's positive and negative: its catchy and simple...kind of like dumbed-down Jimmy Buffet (who knew that was possible)...unfortunately it plays on every Keys cliche imaginable without any attempt at being real...its the Keys as a tourist brochure, not the real Keys, which has a fascinating and unique history and point of viewas a song ""Key West Time"" does get stuck in your head (like a good commercial jingle should), so kudos for that, but as a whole CD? sorry to me its like glorified tropical elevator music"
4,Toward Speaking Excellence (2nd ed.): The Michigan Guide to Maximizing Your Performance on TSE,This book is an indispensable tool for ESL/EFL instructors implementing speaking courses as well as tutoring for TSE test. It is really focused on enhancing non-native speakers' English communication skills.
4,Good book,"This book helps you to get an ideal of the TSE exams. I have not written the exams yet, but surely I will pass. I will recomend this book for everyone."
5,Some good ole country music,"A great cd to have. Tired of hearing that lame ""pop country"" then you'll definitely want to check out this cd. Has that good ole country sound that we don't get to hear too much of anymore. Great songs- Sticks and Stones, How a Cowgirl Say's Good-bye, Paint me a Birmingham...etc."
5,A Great CD,"The cd, The Very Best of Tracy Lawrence, is a great one. So glad I was able to purchase it through amazon.com."
4,Excellent documentary of the invention of television,"""Big Dream, Small Screen"" corrects a historical oversight by chronicling the invention and exploitation of television, focusing on its true inventor Philo T. Farnsworth. Although not a household name like Edision or Bell, Farnsworth's contribution would impact the world forever. This one-hour documentary not only illustrates how Farnsworth struggled to develop television, but how he won a major legal battle with coporate giant RCA to patent it. Through interviews with Farnsworth's family, friends and colleagues and archival footage, director David Dugan captures Farnsworth's drive and genius. You may curse television or praise it; either way, you must admit it's changed the world. This film explains how that change started."
4,great game,I gave it as a gift.. we use it about every couple of weeks..its help up..expected qualitypleased as punch
5,The Great Movie Stars,This is a great book. A must for any lover of classic films and the stars of that era. I had a copy that I read so much I wore it out so I decided to buy another.The copy I just bought at Amazon was in like new condition - really excellent!
3,Nice to have some more stories from the spy master,"It is nice that they released these stories of Ian Fleming's after his death to show the extent of his writing - creating a story. Not much action and adventure, but overall an OK addition to his collection."
2,Dissappointing Final Installment,"Octopussy/The Living Daylights is actually not a Bond ""book"". Rather it is a series of short stories about 007 or involving 007. A couple of the shorts were very good but I was dissappointed in the title stories. If you're expecting stories similar to the movies of the same name, skip this book entirely. If you're just looking to complete the series, probably still worth reading."
2,Boring,"This seems to be some mesh left in a drawer and published just to make some more money. The stories are to short and don't give any depth or real interest in Bond, compared to the normal novels."
4,Great musicological book,"Great source of musicological criticism. Comprehensive. Whittall not only treats the ""avant-garde,"" but also, great 20th century composers (like Puccini) that people actually listen to."
3,The picture sold me. Vote with your ears...,"I was somewhat disappointed with this album. If it consisted solely of Joe Ely songs, it would get five stars. Sadly, it only has one of his songs. But the presence of Terry Allen and wife Jo Harvey, does count for something, so I'll just say I'm glad I got it. Maybe you will be too..."
2,Un relato plano sin mucho interes,"Compré este libro porque habia una promoción a $2.99 en Kindle, pero debo confesar que aunque quería leerlo no encontre mucho de interesante en el mismo. Se trata con mucha superficialidad varios temas que debían ser mas profundos y otros sin duda tiene que acudir a la fantasía para recrear sentimientos muy intimos. En realidad su lectura no deja nada"
4,Very entertaining,"I really enjoyed this book. Teresa Mendoza is a badass! It was interesting to see a woman playing a typical male role. The story was so interesting it made me want to wish it were a true story!Overall it is a survivial story.Unlike Teresa stated at one point of the book, none of it was her choice, since life circumstances made her that way, I think she put herself into that. or at least from the moment Transer Nagra was founded.In her own way, all she is trying to do is to survive and leave behind the ghosts from her past.very entertaining book and story with interesting characters and ssorylines overall."
2,Not what I expected,It was a bit disappointing. I bought the book after so many good reviews but unfortunately didn't fulfil my expectations
5,Un librazo,"Una aventura en toda la talla. Pérez Reverte una vez más atrapa a sus lectores con esta historia que se lee como una película, y también como una pieza de gran narrativa. Es una lástima que a ciertos críticos les haya causado resentimiento el éxito rotundo de tan buena novela. En resumen, los lectores tenemos la palabra."
3,Bottom line... battery will cost you dearly,"The batteries are expensive. It is fun for the first couple of times until you start to feel the pinch in your wallet. I'd rather goto Walmart and buy Bryers all natural premium icecream for $3.99. This item would be good for kids for educational/entertainment, buy at a price."
1,Too much trouble,"I got an ice cream maker for 9.99. I saw others had a similar problem of poor or no mixing. It does start for exactly 5 seconds and then stops. Does not restart. Called amazon and had replacement shipped out. Same issue. Called Panasonic: Nightmare customer service. DO NOT BUY PANASONIC PRODUCTS IF YOU WANT THEIR CUSTOMER CARE. After over 45 minutes of hold on 3 occasions, finally got a kitchen small appliance rep who told me that products bought from Amazon are not covered. Finally, got to return both the makers. It was an awful experience, not worth the money: cost of going to UPS store 2x, retaining all packaging, trying to call Amazon and then emailing them, trying to call Panasonic for support. Very stressful experience: much better and faster icecream from store for 1.99/0.5 gallon including fat free, sugar free Splenda made."
3,Is it just me???,"I bought this ice cream maker for its convenient size after reading some of the mostly good reviews here on Amazon.com. I've made 2 batches of ice cream so far - the second batch is a lot better than the first one - but it tasted more like sorbet than ice cream.I am a raw foodist. I of course used the recipe from one of my raw recipe books. I suspect that my failure was due to the lack of dairy products ( milk, eggs, whipping cream, etc.) in the mix?I also feel that this machine doesn't stir frequently enough. Isn't it true that the more it churns, the more air it gets in the ice cream and the smoother the ice cream becomes?"
1,Batteries not included,I just received my Panasonic BH-941P Ice Cream Maker and was real excited about using it but no batteries was included. After 2 hours going from one dept. to another I still have no answers. I do not want to go to the store and buy when they were suppose to be included....so no ice cream for me.
2,Don't bother,I bought 3 of these during the Friday sale last week for $9.99 now they are $29.99 in the same Friday sale? I put it in and it spins for a few seconds and shuts off.. Tried all three.. they all do the same thing.. WORTHLESS..I'm not picky if I could have just gotten one cup out of it I would have been happy enough.. Nothing...Nada!
3,Just about worth the money,"If you have plenty of clear space in your freezer, and if you don't mind frozen desserts that are very, very sweet (because high sugar content promotes smoothness in the final product), then you can very easily use this device to make small quantities of ice cream, sherbet or sorbet. If however you have enough other stuff in your freezer to impede the free flow of cold air, or if you'd like to make a more tart dessert, then you will wind up with an equally tiny quantity of coarse, grainy stuff that you may as well have made in an ice cube tray.It IS a very clever little device, nevertheless, and worth the price just for that."
2,not what I expected,"First, this is a very tiny unit. Also, it requires 4-5 hours to make the ice cream. Although very inexpensive, it is not a quality product."
4,"A little ice cream, a lot of flavor","This Panasonic uses batteries and fits in your freezer. It doesn't require rock salt or that the bowl be pre-frozen (great! I don't plan ahead). It doesn't make a lot each batch (up to 3 cups). What it does do is make terrific-tasting ice-cream/sorbet in ample amounts for two people or modest-but-adequate amounts for four. We liked it so much we bought four more and gave them to family members (we are not extravagant - the price was THAT low!) and they like the machine too. You can find the batteries cheap online, so don't let that stop you."
4,"Good Ice Cream Maker, but a little too small","This is a very good ice cream maker. It is fast and the ice cream comes out as ice cream, not as milk mush (like some of the other makers these days). It uses batteries so you can put it directly in the freezer. The only real con is that it is very small and makes only enough ice cream for two people (one serving each). I recommend the product highly though."
4,Good Small Portion Homemade Icecream,"We have used the product 2 times since our purchase, and both have been very good experiences. The maker does a nice job. If you want something that only makes a small amount for a tasty treat, this is great. The only negative is that we found the instruction manual to be a bit confusing when it came to recipies other then the basic one. It took us a while to figure out what they were talking about. The product itself, however, works well."
2,You get what you pay for (when it's a 10$ sale),"I've used this ice cream maker twice in making frozen yogurt. I found it inefficient, and the resulting product was hard as a rock afterwards, and I followed the recipe exactly! My biggest issue with this machine, however, is that the battery it requires is 15$, more than what I paid for it. I would like to use it to make regular ice cream to see how it does there, but unfortunately, I can't seem to make the paddle attach properly to the motor anymore. I would probably suggest getting an ice cream maker that's more elaborate, at least with a core that you can put in the freezer, to achieve better results. Buy this if you're a college student like me, on a budget, or only want a cup or two of ice cream. Don't expect quality."
1,cheap but useless,The ice-cream maker runs on 2 lithium batteriesthat cost as much as the maker itself.Instructions and especially recepies are unclear.
4,Handy little ice cream maker!,"I just got my ice cream maker this week and have already made 2 batches. I really like it so far, it works perfect for me.Its really small, so it doesn't make alot...but its perfect for a single person or a couple. When we have made a batch, we have just enough with no leftovers. Some people have complained about the prep of the ingredients. It really isn't that hard or that time consuming. The ice cream that we have made so far has been really yummy! Though I would agree that the basic vanilla recipe is a bit too sweet!All in all it makes great tasting ice cream, and is very easy to use."
4,Read the Instructions!!!!!,The previous reviewer mentioned it started working for a few seconds and then stopped. Thats what its supposed to do!!! It will keep turning on and off based on the consistency of the ice cream. It also specifically states that in the instructions...will switch off after initial 5 seconds. Please read the instructions before using any appliance!All I can say its a great buy for $9.99. But not for $29+. Great ice cream maker but too small to make anything more than a few servings that will feed a family of four.
3,batteries are costly,"This is a nice unit ""except"" it uses CR-123 batteries, which aren't cheap. Other than that, it's good. You would think that they would use AA batteries, which are more readily available and cheaper. Just my opinion."
3,Ice cream maker,"The price was EXCELLANT! This compared to other places that had this same product to offer.Unfortunately, it did not produce as good of a product as other ice cream machines I have had over the years."
3,Give it off,"When I got this, my initial reaction was, wow so small and mmMmm ice cream, But once i took it out of the box i noticed it was battery operated. So basically u have to put the ingredients into the maker and put it into the freezer. Buying the ingredients are just as tasking as picking up ice cream at the store. Plus I still cant find where and what heavy cream is"
2,"Good idea, bad results","This ice cream maker attempts to solve one of the problems of low-cost ice cream makers, which either use a freezable bowl or ice and rock salt: the need to plan ahead. It sounds like a wonderful idea to be able to pop the whole unit it the freezer and magically get out ice cream, but the way that good, smooth ice cream is made is to freeze the mixture _fast_. Having ice or a bowl with frozen gel allows heat to quickly conduct out of the ice cream mixture, discouraging the formation of large ice crystals and creating a smooth result. This unit, however, relies on the cold freezer air to freeze the ice cream over hours. The result is a grainy mess. High-fat mixtures do a little bit better (the formation of ice crystals is limited by all of the milkfat), but forget ice milk, frozen yogurts, or frozen fruit desserts. The result, quite literally, will not be much different than if you just placed a bowl in the freezer."
5,"So down to earth,funny and educational.","I really like Ron's book...so matter of fact...written so anyone can understand and enjoy. Funny, and yet sad in many ways.I particularly liked the stories of his co-workers and about his Dad. I would recomend all readers to buy this book, and enjoy!"
4,pacy and thrilling,"This is a tale of an horrific house break-in and a very gory murder of almost an entire family.It seems to have taken place for no apparent reason,and it takes a very feisty woman detective to sort it all out.Lynn Hightower sets a cracking pace and maintains your interest for the entire book.This is a very good ,fast read, with aspects of hidden agendas and enough psychological twists to keep you guessing up to the last."
5,Shipped Quickly and Works As Expected,"The fantastic fan was an optional feature when I ordered my camper 10 years ago but I skipped on it because I wanted to save a couple of bucks. For the last decade I've spent countless nights in Baja California simmering in my camper while trying to catch a couple hours of sleep. I tried screwing battery powered fans to the ceiling but it was a hassle and I always ended up bumping into them.The fantastic fan is powerful and quiet. My camper has a solar panel to recharge the battery in the morning so power isn't an issue. The reversible switch allows me to blow air on myself while sleeping and ventilate the camper when cooking. Installation is straight forward and I was impressed the quality of the product. I have two vents in the camper and will be ordering a second fan shortly.The product shipped quickly. Enjoy camping in humid areas? If so, spend the cash and upgrade your sleeping experience."
5,The Dead Man Becomes Alive!,"This book is about witchcraft. In the story, Selwyn, the 17-year old boy, is accused of a murder.Farold is the guy who is murdered. Selwyn is innocent, but he is punished. He was sent to a burial cave and was locked. The witch helped him get out of there and made Farold alive in a bat's body. You'll have to find out who is the real murderer when you read the book. I greatly recommend this book. It's a GREAT BOOK!"
3,never trust a dead man,"This novel was very good. The plot of this book is Sewlyn was convicted of murdering his worst enemy.The village put Sewlyn in Farolds tomb and a witch came for some ingredients and found Sewlyn and listened to his problem. She raised Farold from the dead as a bat. Now Sewlyn and Farold , once great enemies, have to join togather to find the real murderer of Farold.This book would be good for about every age group 5-20.I really liked this book a lot. I liked this book because I could not put it down and it always had me on the edge of my seat. This is the book review for Never Trust a Dead Man by Vivian Vande Velde."
3,Pretty good color studies,"This book is OK, reproductions are fine, but a review of a book of this sort ends up being a review of the artist's work. The guy does some nice color studies, kind of analytically. I suspect he works from photos because a lot of the paintings have a traced look (but with, as I said, very studiously scientific color transitions), and the one charcoal drawing from life they print is downright awful (terrible proportions and no volumn). He's obviously imitating Sorolla, a contemporary of Sargent's who is really good, even to the kids on the beach subject matter. Sorolla's scenes look real, Asaro's look artificial, mainly due to the over-saturated candy colors, but there is also a contrived, impersonal quality to the work, as though he is demonstrating color theory. Most painters have a copy of this book on their shelves, though, and Asaro is considered instructive."
4,49th Parallel - self-titled (Lion Productions),"A lesser-known Canadian psychedelic band that I'm just finding out about. Thank goddness for the Internet, no? Band existed from 1966-70. Tracks that made this CD well worth hunting down are ""Get Away"", the foot-stomping ""Lazerander Filchy"", the power ballad ""The Magician"", ""Twilight Woman"", ""You Do Things"", the psych gem ""Close The Barn Door"" and ""Citizen Freak"". Personnel: Dennis Abbott - vocals, Dan Lowe and Bob Carlson - guitars, Mick Woodhouse - bass, Dave Petch - organ and Terry Bare - drums. On this CD reissue, get the lp's original ten songs + eleven added bonus tracks. This 49th Parallel work might sound a bit dated, but it's still great to listen to. The band's music clearly offers their fans strong melodies, fine playing and superb production to thoroughly absorb. Should do a lot for fans of The Nazz, The Move, Status Quo and Stillroven."
5,UC Logic Drawing Tablet,"I know everybody thinks ""wacom"" when they want a pressure sensitive drawing tablet, but recently I needed one to use on a trip and had the UC Logic 5X4 tablet shipped overnight.It was great. Yes, it has a battery in the stylus, but I didn't find the weight or shape at all awkward. The product works as well as my Wacoms, had all sorts of programmable hot spots, and was just a delightful surprise in every way. As a digital art instructor, for Eclectic Academy, an online school, I highly recommend this tablet.Christine Frey"
4,Good and effective,"I was really excited for this DVD to come out. I use it on my strength training days to supplement the toning of my mid section (which took a beating after having 2 kids).I like that it has different workouts depending on what stage you are at. I was hoping the third level would be a little more challenging, as my core is currently very strong. I usually just combine the 2nd and 3rd workouts, and that's a killer.I like her nutrition reminders, as eating is SO important, and I always need a reminder:) And my daughter loves that there's ""homework"" and always asks ME if I've done my homework :)."
3,Okay,"Got this for the diastisis recti exercises, but according to my physiotherapist who specializes in issues after birth, I shouldn't be doing most of those exercises until the diastisis heals anyway! The ones she gave me are much more basic ones, using the binding, pulling in the transverse muscle and then just lifting the head off the floor only ( not a full crunch), and the plank is okay."
4,Great way to start!,"This is a great exercise dvd to begin with! She really helps give you the basics of working on your pelvic floor. I am not very good at this, but she really seemed to break it down for me. I feel like Lindsay Brin knows exactly what it is like to be trying to regain your body back after having a baby instead of just telling me that so I feel better!"
4,Not too bad,"It's a good core workout, but redundant with her bootcamp video which I also have. Is easy to do superfast. Can't attest to results as I've been slack about actually doing the videos."
2,too easy,Too short too easy get something else: there is no way you get flat stomack by doing this every day
1,Would give it zero stars if I could!,"I am a huge fan of S. Laurens. For the most part I have enjoyed her series, but this is by far the worst S. Laurens book I have ever read. This author seems to be losing steam.The characters were boring, annoying, and completely unbelievable. The ""plot"" (if I can even bring myself to call it such) was unconvincing and poorly executed. The whole thing makes very little sense in a historical (or just realistic) perspective. It took me several days to finish this one because I just couldn't stay focused and kept putting it down.All-in-all... a waste of time and money!"
2,forgettable,"I have rather mixed feelings about this one. I liked the the two characters, and the initial storyline of the heroine who had replaced the hero as 'man of the house', However, I didn't like the everything-ends-well-ending which was completely overdone and unbelieveable (she goes from outcast to gods-gift-on-earth within a few weeks). The sex scenes were a little too frequent (although it fits the title) and it is ridiculous to link these to his concussion-needs-anaesthetics storyline.... all in all, a forgettable romance."
1,couldn't even finish this one,"I have read every book this author has written. However, I couldnot finish this one. The main female character was so argumentative, stubborn,and totally irritating that I gave upabout halfway through. I couldn't believe any man would put upwith her long enough to fall in love."
3,"Slow beginning, but gets better.","The book has some light, heartwarming moments, 10+ page bedroom scenes, adventure, suspence, and plenty of romance. For those who follow ""Bastion Club"" characters, there is a brief appearance of few of them in the book, or at least a mention of them.The book gets a slow start when Ms. Laurens gets into too much details of how the main characters feel. At times, it was like watching people in slow motion, because every move, every line of dialog was followed by three-four statements to describe the emotion behind it. Either I got used to it, or the ""sidesteps"" got shorter after a while, but the book got all much better after initial 100 pages. I am already looking forward to the next ""Bastion Club""."
5,Just Delightful!,"Oh this book was wonderful! My favorite so far. I particularly liked the hero - a gentleman of tremendous wisdom and integrity who has given up finding a suitable bride and gladly retires to his beloved home in the country. There he encounters a ""warrior-queen"" who ends up being the perfect match for him. He decides to win her by treating her as an equal and lending her unfailing support, even though that means curbing his natural dominance. What unfolds is a wonderful love story between two independent and mature people - two people who refuse to be manipulated by society's rules.It was so good I read it twice."
2,Finding it hard to finish,"I am having a very hard time finishing this book, I find the book to wordymost of Stephanie's Books are tooooo long, and wordy, maybe a little lessdetails, discribing the emotions and thoughts would make a better read"
3,TIRING,"I HAVE READ TEN OR MORE BOOKS BY LAURENS AND USUALLY ZIP RIGHT THROUGH THEM UNTIL NOW. MAYBE I'M BURNT OUT, BUT THIS BOOK LACKS THE LUSTER THAT HAS MADE ME SCOOP UP HER NOVELS OF THE PAST."
3,"Good, but I wanted more","This was an okay read, but I have been looking forward to it coming out and found myself wanting more. This book had no real push and pull between the hero and heroine. Everything just seems to fall into place and I was looking forward to another ""Jack and Kit"", ""Amanda and Martin"", or ""Devil and Honoria""."
2,Save your Money,"`A Fine Passion' just was boring. The romance story was passable but the mystery was confusing and tedious. It took me almost a week to read this book because I would find other things to do. So, if you need a clean house then pick up this book because you find yourself gravitating to others things. If you were looking for a romance/mystery, I would buy A Loving Scoundrel by Johanna Lindsey or `When We Meet' by Victoria Alexander and save your money on this one."
2,"Give me a ""B""!","This book is boring!!!! I'm finding it hard to finish a chapter. The female lead (Lady Clarice) is not one of my favorites. I can understand being attracted to physical attributes initially. However, after she opens her mouth, I'm not sure why Warnefleet is pursuing her. I haven't finished the book and I'm not sure I can. Its just that bad."
4,An isolated heroine,"Lady Clarice is one of my most liked Stephanie Laurens heroine: isolated, strong and independent. She has built a life for herself, when along comes the hero. After many comings and goings, everything comes into place and she is vindicated. I love it"
2,Disappointing,Love this series of book but this one is just too repetitive and drawn out - it would have been far better as a novella!
2,Hmmm.......,"The characters were okay, but nothing remarkable -- he the usual noble perfect man, she the usual feisty perfect woman, both the usual pair who can't resist each other once they ""roll in the hay.""The mystery, if it can be called that, was utterly boring. The love story predictable and somehow passionless. And way too many parties of ""the ton"" with too many Lords what-is-name and Ladies so-and-so. Who cares?"
5,library lady,Stephanie Laurens is a master at combining intrigue and romance. Once again she hits the ball out of the park. This is a book you will want to re-read every so often.
5,Nice for the Price,Infinity Reference and Kappa car speakers are the only brand/models I ever buy for moblie audio and for special projects like Sealed Lead Acid battery powered MP3 player boomboxes with small subwoofers.You will not be disapointed with infinity!
5,Great!,"This is my favorite mens cologne! First time I smelled it was on a hair cutting client of mine and I asked what he was wearing, when he said Pi by Givenchy. I ran out and bought it for my then husband for Christmas, that was 15 years ago! Still love the smell, just not on my ex-husband! LOL, a great deal at a great price as a tester, you will want to buy larger once you smell it!"
1,disappointed......,I was hoping for something better than this. I have a thorough background in this stuff and think it could have been presented in a much better way. A good break down of the CAGED system would have been nice for beginers using this book aswell as a bit of chord theory. There were lots of small errors aswell. If you know how too construct arpeggios you'd catch them but a beginer/intermediate might not. I think there were many redundent arpeggios in here and the book would be more work than what it's worth.....that being said I'm personally a study fiend and study as much usefull guitar material as I can.
5,Excellence is within your reach,"This is a bold book requiring high skill levels to achieve perfect results. However, it also covers a wide range of techniques which are helpfully broken down into small steps that the average or enthusiastic beginner can attempt with remarkable results. Careful reading of the entire book by the novice will show areas that enableall levels of skills that can be attempted or modified."
2,Self-indulgent claptrap,"Elvis Costello may be one of the most literate songwriters in pop music -- he certainly has the best vocabulary. This book, however, consists mostly of tedious line-by-line dissections of his songs for hidden meanings and social commentary, and much of the artistry is lost along the way. One is reminded of '60s types looking for hidden messages in Beatles and Dylan lyrics, and it's not a pretty sight. Only a die-hard Costello aficianado could make it through this tedious book, and so I did -- despite the hopeless morass."
2,"illuminating, but off the mark too often","I found the book interesting, mostly because it's only book I could find analyzing his music. The author is way off on some of his ""interpretations"", and delves into fiction sometimes with his own theories about what songs or phrases in songs mean. This is why artists like Costello HATE having their songs dissected. they usually get it wrong."
1,very poor effort,"Gouldstone comes off as an overzealous inexperienced high-school essayist in this flawed estimation of Costello's work. He brings up the kind of insights that one would think of on his/her own, yet not bother to articulate. Innocent trees died for this book. I'm a big fan of Costello's and was deeply disappointed on all levels, though I now understand why Elvis doesn't often speak with the press. Read Bruce Thomas' ""The Big Wheel"". It's a better ride."
3,Something's missing,"As a big Elvis fan and possessor of all the albums discussed in the book, reading this was essential. The author doesn't claim to be an authority of any sort. He also admits that he admires only ""some"" of Elvis' work. I got the feeling that this was an assignment. He does seem to draw some conclusions that no one else would but he certainly does a better job than I could. Fans of Elvis with an interest in his lyrics should get this. It does, however, shockingly omit some important background to the ""Get Happy"" album. There was an infamous incident that took place between the recording of ""Get Happy"" and the previous album that led to Elvis being temporarily banned from the U.S. It is debatable how directly the incident informed the lyrics but to ignore it altogether as if it didn't happen blows me away. I would love to hear the author's defence of this as it has certainly been brought to his attention by now."
2,It's Nothing Special,"This &quot;lyrical companion&quot; occasionally offers some decent insights into Costello's work, but Gouldstone often comes off as a mediocre writer trying to sound scholarly. The interpretations of his songs range from the obvious to the absurdly obscure. Worth reading for big Elvis fans, but otherwise, it's useless."
2,A Good Laugh,"If you plan to get some sort of deep insight into Costello's lyrics with this book, give up now. However, if you can stomach all 200 pages of this book, you will atleast walk away with a few good laughs. Gouldstone completely misunderstands practically each and every Costello song. Not to mention he insults some of his best albums. I got a kick out of this book because it made me realize that there are some people out there who are so arrogant as to think they know everything when they actually know nothing."
1,trailer cover,helloi was not satisfied with this product. the straps on the bottom of the cover fell off as i applied pressure to it. i called for a replacement and was told that they would fix the one i had and not send out A new one? i dont want the defective one. i was told thet i would recieve a call tag to return it but to date 11-24-07 i have gotten nothing. i would not buy from them until this is resolved! beverly bay horse trailer coverjb
1,Total crap!! Do not buy!!,"Do not waste your money on this trailer cover!! I have been through two, and both were crap. The first one I bought shredded to pieces after it had been on the trailer only about 6 months. They did replace it with a new cover, and that one only lasted 7 months! It too started ripping and fell apart. Now they say the warranty was fulfilled so they will not replace it again."
4,A decent introduction to mass transfer and separations,"I used this text for a junior level mass transfer and separtions course at Michigan State University. It's a good book because it covers everything from the basics of formulating mass transfer models to convective mass transfer to distillation, absorbtion and extraction, but I believe the book is better suited to graduate students or chemical engineering professionals. My undergraduate course only made use of the second half of the book, and I didn't feel it had enough design and application material."
4,enjoyable for parents and children,"This is an enjoyable book for both the parents and children, illustrated in a lively way."
4,All by Myself,The book arrived within the expected timeframe and was in good condition. I would recommend this seller to anyone interested in purchasing children's books.
1,Grandson had allergic reaction to diapers,"Sent these diapers to my grandson size 4, he had an allergic reaction to them not sure what is in the diaper to cause this. Before I could ask my daughter in law to send them back she had already donated them to a local charity."
1,Snug? Maybe. Dry? Not so much!,"Uggh! ""Snug and DRY"" does not fit this diaper! I used them for a few months because they are cheaper than Pampers and other brands leaked for my son. Well, this brand leaks too! I moved on to ""Little Movers"" and LOVE them! If you have a heavy wetter, or don't want to be changing your 14mo. old's diaper in the middle of the night (and sheets and blankets)...I STRONGLY recommend using the Huggies ""Little Movers!"""
2,Leaks like CRAZY,"I am not sure what the deal is...Every kid is different when it comes to diapers I guess. But, these for us, LEAK LIKE CRAZY! And don't even mention poop, WHAT A NIGHTMARE! Good price, not the best at keeping everything in..."
2,always leaks,"I have been using Luvs but got huggies on sale at target and wow what a mistake. I have never had a problem with leaks before but these diapers leak everyday. It is just a little during the day but they do not make it through the night at all. once this box is up i'm going back to luvs. could not believe they stood up better than these, I thought I was upgrading!"
2,Very Unhappy,"I have not been disappointed with Huggies in the past. I don't typically buy them simply because they are more expensive then Luvs, and I've found Luvs to be of excellent quality so far. But, the Luvs I normally order were out of stock so I got the huggies instead. I want my money back. I got the 150-something count size three, and I've had to throw away at least four CLEAN, unused diapers so far. When I gently pulled on the front strap to close the diaper around my 1 yr. old daughter, the strap has pulled completely off. I don't pull that hard. Very poor quality. Four diapers so far. I'm getting really irritated. Huggies diapers are expensive enough without my having to waste at least four of them so far. I'm sticking with luvs from now on."
2,Leaked every day,"My sister-in-law gave me some gigantic boxes of these when my husband was laid off. So we put them on our daughter and she leaked the first day. And the second day. And the third day. She leaked almost every day! We used up all the diapers since we couldn't afford to buy different ones. Once we ran out we went back to using the cheap Parent's Choice diapers that we never have problems with.I gave this two stars because we use Huggies Overnites with no problems. I don't know how they make great overnight diapers and crappy daytime diapers, but whatever."
2,Used to be my favorite,My low rating is less an indictment on the snug and dry and more the amazing upgrade with the Slip-Ons Slip ons rule the earth with an iron fist. I lve them .Wife loves them . darling daughter loves them . go slipons.
5,Great Product -- so my daughter says!,"I buy and have delivered these large boxes because they are such a value. My daughter, who lives in another state, has enough financial responsibilities so when I can help out, I do..and with an 18 month at home, you can imagine how helpful a supply like this is. She says HUGGIES are her favorite brand..."
4,BEST DIAPER FOR THE MONEY!!,GREAT FOR MY ON THE MOVE TODDLER AND HIS NEWLY CRAWLING BROTHER!! THEY HOLD LEAKS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER DIAPER I HAVE USED. WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY. EXTREMELY HAPPY AND WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.
3,Turns baby clothes blue,"The diapers are not as soft as Pampers, and the ink comes off onto all my baby's clothes, so everything is blue on the inside and stays that way even after a wash. Otherwise, they are absorbant enough, but I'm going back to Pampers."
2,Used to love them,"I have a 15 month old and have used Huggies Snug N Dry exclusively since he was about 3 months old. Amazon has the best deal I can find on them. I loved them and then they went and changed them. I got a box that put blue dye on my babies legs (the babysitter thought he'd had a horrible fall) and while he was in the he had a horrible diaper rash. It was dumb on my part but I didn't think about the diapers causing the rash until I got the next box that happened to be the older diapers that we used to love and the diaper rash immediately went away. I was hoping Huggies had decided to switch back to the old way of making them, but no. I got another box of blue diapers. I've already started shopping around for a new diaper for my baby."
1,Price up by 6 DOllars within 3 weeks,"Until MArch the box with 140 diapers was 23 Dollars with teh subcription discount - now it's 29 Dollars. Parents, you get it cheaper at TArget!"
2,Huggies,"I purchased this product and my son manages to always pee through his diaper. I dont think they fit him right, and my friend has the same problem with he son in these diapers. Luvs and Pampers seem to do alot better."
4,Love Huggies,"Love Huggies, only diapers that won't give my daughter diaper rash! This box was delivered open, but the plastic around the diapers was still intact, that's why I gave it only 4 stars."
4,Best Buy,"Not quite as absorbant as Pampers, but she still makes it through the night just fine. Only 3 blowouts in 6 months. Also, a better buy now that Pampers doesnt have free shipping. Esp with the subscriber savings. Recommended."
5,good diapers,"really good diapers. we did have a little problem with stuff coming out the back, but overall pleased. the pampers swaddlers seem a tad better, but also more expensive. you get what you pay for."
4,good,Good product most of the time (had two packages with several unusable diapers in those over 1.5 years of usage). Really good price with Subscribe and Save program.
1,"Don't buy it Huggies size 4 baby-shaped fit ,pack of 126 diapers","I've used size different Huggies. I think it is a good brand. For all the Huggies I used before I gave them 5 stars.But this time, I was very disappointed about the quality of this product. After put the diaper on my baby, the stuff in the diaper breaks and form several big chunks ever when the diaper is dry. It is uncomfortable to have big chunks under baby's body when baby needs lie down. So I have to change a new diaper every time my baby goes to sleep no matter whether the diaper is wet or dry."
4,Great Diapers,"I love these diapers, My baby was in the hospital for three months when she was born, and they started her on pampers then moved to premie huggies by the time she was out. I like huggies alot better. I like the snug and dry alittle better than the little snugglers, but I wish snug and dry had the wetness indicator too. Overall just great diapers, and buying here on Amazonmom.com is such a blessing and savings!"
4,Its nice!,"My son is 5 months now. I must say huggies snug and dry plays a big role in his and my life!Its good so far, but yes I have seen a little leak outs sometimes but they are mostly dry even after an hour. And they keep changing the designs on the diaper which confuses me with the size.Talking about the packing and condition, its really impressive. All in all a good diaper for your munchkin! :)"
5,Diapers,"I am very pleased with the Huggies brand diapers, I used them with my oldest daughter, who is now in her twenties and I glad to see that over the years, these diapers haven't lost their quality, having them delivered right to our door is a plus!!!!"
1,Try #2 Fails Again;(,"This is the second time I have given Huggies a try (the first being as a baby shower gift for when my son was first born). I was using Pampers and my son was developing a slight rash in the folds of his thighs so I thought that maybe it was the diapers that weren't fitting correctly in that area. I remembered seeing Huggies branding with the SnugFit design and thought maybe this would offer better protection. Well, I was wrong! Although these diapers seem to keep the leg area dry, his rash never subsided (only diminished after I used a plethora of powder every time), and almost EVERY time he would leak out of the top, especially during the nighttime. It's really frustrating to CONSTANTLY be changing and washing wet baby clothes. I will definitely be switching back."
1,Bad Labeling and Description,"This product contains ONLY ""Step 1"" size diapers. Do not be fooled by the ""Step 1-2"" labeling on the package and in the description."
1,leaky diaper,I have twin girls and made the mistake in buying these. We couldn't wait for the box to be empty. The girls always needed out fit changes due to the diaper leaking through the layers. One expects some leaking around the edges but right through the diaper. I will never buy again.
3,Great price/ not quality,"The price was good, however, it should indicate somewhere, that these big packages diapers are not the same quality of diaper as the regular smaller packages, you can get elsewhere. They are thinner and don't hold as much wetness in the diaper. So you have to change the diaper more frequently, therefore, is it really worth it in the end?"
1,Wasted Money - Constant Leaks,"We've used the Diapers.com brand diapers since our 2 year old was born - never any leaks. Since I was already placing an Amazon order I decided to add a box of Huggies Snug & Dry. What a HUGE mistake. They leak so easily that we might as well be putting him to bed without any diaper at all. I'm writing this review at 4:30 am because I just finished changing his sheets after another leak - the bed was soaked, but the diaper was barely damp! These work okay during the day when gravity pulls the wetness into the small absorbent area, but if they are laying down - forget it. Get ready for sleepless nights and wet sheets."
4,Good fit,The diapers fit my daughter beautifully. Unfortuanetly for some reason they bother her bottom so we are switching back to the regular huggies.
5,Huggies Diaper Size 3 Review,"I love Huggies diapers and I can always count on the quality when they come shipped from Amazon.Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers, Size 3, 156-Count"
4,Huggies Snug and Dry have worked the best for our toddler boys,"Our boys are 2.5 and 3.5 years old. They have used a few other brands at times, but Snug & Dry has contained most all messes the best. The extra leg elastic, the absorbancy and the back eleastic have allowed for very rare leakage. The only gripe I have is that sometimes the diapers have a rough bit of padding just below the waist band and I do not think that it would be very comfortable for them while lying on their back to sleep or during long car rides. I have brought this up with Amazon and they were going to speak to Huggies about it (especially important in the night time diapers - up to 12 hours in the same diaper with rough spots against their skin would not be good.) Amazon was great about refunding or giving credit for the rough/stiffly lumpy diapers.Huggies Snug and Dry are the best diaper for the 1-4 year old age range though! (However, I'll be glad when they are potty trained!)"
4,The Poop Stops Here,I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 because They are a bit stiffer than Luvs and Pampers. Also they are more expensive than Luvs.I had to switch to Huggies from Luvs because my baby girl started to have her poop migrate up her back! The Luvs were great until that started to happen. Huggies is the only name brand diaper that I've seen with the elasticy back or the Snug Fit Waistband as they call it. I just got the diapers in today and they couldn't have come quick enough. They solved the problem. The poop stopped at the 'elastic' and I didn't have to change another poopy outfit.
5,Great!!!!,"Same price as Sam's club, but more diapers. Received them in 2 days no hassel!If my son insnt potty trained by the time im done with these, I will be buying more."
5,Very good and comfortable for infants..,I have been using the Huggies diapers for my kids since last 5 years (2 kids) and have been very pleased with them.I have tried other diapers for my kids and have one or the other issues but never with Huggies.Though they are slightly higher in price but the quality is really worth couple of cents extra that you will be spending per diaper for Huggies...Not to mention that you will be using more diapers per day if you are using the cheaper brand. So the per diaper cost ma be less but total monthly cost will remain the same.....
5,Great deal!!,"This is an excellent deal for a bunch of diapers!! I couldn't believe that the price was right for so many diapers. Great product for great price. I could never use Huggies on my girls because they leaked, but they work great for my son."
2,won't buy again,I only buy pampers baby dry but thought I would try huggies because they have bigger tabs. They are fine if your child is not a heavy wetter and you are on top on changing right away. They leak terrible for night time even with a changing in the middle of the night. I will go back to pampers.
3,Enjoy the Ride Code is EXPIRED!!!!!,"purchased this around Christmas 2010, it's our 1st time buying huggies from Amazon, instead of Costco, and we noticed that the fasteners are the old kinds, not the new more rectangular looking ones that we got the month before from Costco. Surely enough, when we entered the Enjoy the Ride Code into Huggies website, all of the codes show EXPIRED. So I am guessing this shipment might have been the old stock from earlier time."
2,Overpriced,"My wife bought these at Target tonight for around $27, I don't understand the pricing at all."
4,Gentle and sturdy,"Great for sensitive skin! My kid gets a rash with any other diaper and pull-ups. These are better than the 'Natural Fit', because there is more padding and less leakage. The added padding is not tremendous- it doesn't inhibit movement and has helped cushion the falls of toddlerdom! I love these diapers and recommend them to all moms. The ONLY reason I don't give them 5 stars is that I've had to throw out at least 3 diapers per pack due to ripped seals or tabs. Still, I don't use anything else."
2,Leak and mess,"We bought Huggies and hoped they would be snug and dry and they were for the 1st hour or so, then they leak not from the sides,(like if they are wrong size) but from the surface, which I can't find the reason why.Liquid just sips through, even when they half full and you end up with clothes wet and your arm smelly when you pick up your baby.Contacted company which produces Huggies, they positive because of wrong size ( too big), but our baby within that size range, so I don't know what's wrong with them. probably will switch to another brand."
1,Pampers are so much better...,"I was given a case of huggies newborns for my baby shower, and proceeded to use them once she came home from the hospital. My daughter had a diaper rash within three days, and i tried everything to get rid of the rash. When I was at a friends house on vacation I ran out of diapers and sent my spouse to the store for diapers, and he brought back pampers, well needless to say the rash was gone within 48 hours. I honestly believe that the diapers caused her rash. I haven't used them again since then, and she hasn't had another diaper rash since, and she is now 8 mths old!!! I use the sensitive skin wipes and pampers swaddlers now...I wouldn't use huggies again, and besides the rash the diapers leaked, and bunched up between her little legs. I wouldn't recommend these diapers!!!"
5,Huggies are the best diapers!,"Huggies are the best diapers! I love Huggies Supreme but these are great as well. I have tried Pampers, but returned to Huggies. Huggies fit well, they are easy to put on, they rarely leak and they can HOLD!!"
1,Diaper Rash,"We've been using Pampers baby dry for some time, however Huggies seemed to be a little cheaper. We made the switch and ordered 3 boxes. Unfortunately, the diapers caused my boy to develop a bad diaper rash. We tried ointments with no luck. We bought a small pack of Pampers to see if it could be the diapers and sure enough the rash started to look better in a few days. He's since been rash free. I feel this is mostly due to the way the Pampers absorb fluids as well as draw them aware from the skin. If you have a sensitive skin baby, try Pampers and avoid the Huggies. Also, the Pampers tend to fit a little better, helping to eliminate leaks."
1,Very bad quality,"I used Huggies diapers before, that were good. For some reason the latest shipment I got are very bad. Their quality is very bad compare to same huggies diapers from SAMS. My guess is huggies is trying to clear their bad quality diapers through Amazon promotion."
5,Just great!,"My son is a big boy, one years old and wears 2t and weighs 28 lbs. he's tall and solid. Finding the right clothes and diapers have been a challenge. These fit him better than any of the others that come in size six. I've tried them all and they are either too narrow or rub against his skin too high on the belly."
5,Keeps baby dry,Ive always used huggies brand and love them. Theyve always kept my son dry and we have never had any problema with them.
2,Go with Pampers!,"Compared to Pampers products of the same size, Huggies seem to be bulkier, especially once they stay one for a bit longer. Went through one box with my second baby and switched right back to Pampers."
2,Not the best,Diapers are cheap and plastic feeling... They also leak and don't seem to seal around my daughters legs. I won't be purchasing them again.
2,Sizing is WAY different from the Huggies S & D I bought in store!,"Bought these diapers because I use Huggies and have always thought they are great, however, these size 3's are MUCH smaller than ANY of the 3's I've bought in store and are almost too small for my 19lb baby! I'm so annoyed I bought an entire box of size 3's which SHOULD fit him well but don't! Also, the tabs are different, they are not rounded at all and are scratchy if baby touches them, they also rip off just opening the diapers."
2,disappointed,"I found out that amazon sells diapers through a magazine promotion and jumped on it cuz i hate spending too much money on diapers, but i love the huggies brand, anyway, i got a good discount and free shipping, but the problem is that a number of the diapers broke off as i was trying to put them on my babies so they just went to waste unused and i also had unusual leakage problems..."
5,diaperdeal,"Amazon provided a great product at a great price. I took advantage of the Amazon Subcribe and Save offer that allowed for a 15% discount when you sign up for repeat delivery service for your order. A special promotion also allowed for an additional 15% savings on the Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers (Size 2 - 100 Ct.). The best deal was being able to combine an Amazon 20% off discount code from a Parent magazine. I researched the cost of diapers with sales and coupons and found the Amazon deal to be the best value. I have promoted Amazon to friends and family, and I will be on the lookout for more special deals."
5,Love subscribe and save,Amazon is amazing. I love the subscribe and save program. This is the best way to get diapers. Delivered to my door and super resonable! Thanks! Huggies are great diapers. I have used them for the past 4 years for my kids.
1,frustrated,"I'm so frustrated with Amazon I could SCREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've tried to cancel this order and they won't cancel, since they couldn't figure that out, I thought I would change the size they can't get that right, either. This is the third package that is incorrect. I don't like to leave negative feedback but this is beyond ridiculous!!"
2,Huggies Baby-Shaped Fit Diapers,Don't really care for these diapers because one they don't really fit my son because the size is too expanded. The diapers sag and make it appear that he's really wet and I know that's not the case because I change him often.
2,Good Absorption but it is not soft and with rash for my toddler,"My toddler using Pampers BabyDry and then to Huggies Snug&Dry. We noticed Huggies diapers would leave some cotton remains or like sand stuff if it get too soak, and my kid has rash. It can be a part of too long without the change, but it never happen in Pampers. Pampers BabyDry is softer and looks like better price if in on-sales. I probably stick with Pampers."
5,Huggies has yet to disappoint,"I have been extremely happy with huggies diapers, and these have been no exception. I will say first of all that although these claim to support babies from 16-28 lb at this size - I would be really shocked if my baby fit these diapers when she reaches 22-23 lb. She's 18 lb and they already seem like they won't fit for another month or two. I've read complaints that the dye runs on these diapers, but I haven't experienced it. One thing I have noticed is that these diapers don't swell as much as the other huggies. It makes it a little more difficult to tell if they are wet, but they are definitely comfortable for my little one. I haven't noticed any trouble moving, so I probably won't be switching to the little movers huggies diapers. All in all - I love these diapers!"
4,Great product for the most part,The only problem I have with the diapers is that the dye from the diaper tends to stain my daughters skin. It does wash right off but it is annoying. Other than that the diapers are great.
2,Not a fan,"I am not a big fan of these diapers...I am sure that they are good for some, but I have found Pampers better and these seemed cheap in quality and price."
4,Excellent Service,"I usually go to the local Target or Walmart store to purchase diapers. Since I usully pick up a box of diapers, it became a trip when I had to go just for the diapers, so I decided to order online, knowing I had at least a 4 days supply of diapers. I got free shipping and no *TAX* and the boxes (huggies size 3 and size 6) arrived via UPS together three days later. Will definitely order online again."
5,Huggies diapers,I have used Huggies diapers (and wipes) for 3 1/2 years and I've never had a complaint about them. That cannot be said of other diaper brands. The regular diapers work just as well for my active toddler and infant as the Supremes.
5,Excellent Quality with a Price to Match!,"I have to babies and these diapers are EXCELLENT!!!I don't know what was wrong with the lady that said these were low quality diapers. Maybe she left the remarks for HUGGIES by mistake! These are the ONLY diapers that we can use on our babies, if not they break-out with a rash. So again, was the remark ment to be for Pampers?Over all, this is the BEST deal for diapers! I buy them at over $100 per shipment, and save $$$ all the time!"
4,I love Huggies!,"Huggies are my favorite diaper. How I get them for so cheap is I get the coupons out of Parents Magazine, use gift cards I earn from Swagbucks, and sign up for the Subscribe and Save. This all equals some very inexpensive diapers that I love!"
3,Works for pee- terrible for poop!,"I'm going back to Babies R' Us generic brand. Have had way too many ""blowouts"" with these diapers. They are soft though."
2,Leaked more than any other diapers we've tried,"As compared to the Pampers Swaddlers and Nature Babycare diapers, these leaked much more often. I tried these instead of the Nature Babycare for price reasons, but should have known that you get what you pay for. Before we tried these, we had maybe 4 or 5 leaks since our son was born (he just turned 1). We tried a box of these for a month, and he woke up soaked at least once a week. We tried the user tips of unfolding them all the way, etc., and that didn't seem to make a difference. We won't be ordering these again-it's not worth the mess, laundry, and baby being uncomfortable."
2,They got cheaper,"I have been receiving these Huggies size 4 diapers with my Amazon Subsribe and Save subscription and have been very happy with them until now. However, when I got my latest shipment, I noticed they had a new design, and, now I see,they are cheaper quality as well. Although I had always needed the Overnites for overnight, now even during the day the outside of his diaper feels damp every time I change him. I think they are also stiffer and thinner. Oh well, we thought we had the ideal diaper for him, but now we'll have to reconsider."
1,Leaky and smells funny,"Very dissapointed in these, now I know they are the cheaper of the Huggies brand diapers but I've had nothing but leaks and they have a terrible smell soiled or not. I really wish they would make the snugglers larger than size 2. Looks like I'll be going back to the more expensive Pure and Natural Huggies as they are soft, absorbant and available in the larger sizes."
5,Love these diapers,Nearly the only brand I've used since my 22 month old was born. We loves these diapers and never have issues with leaks.
2,These have got to be the WORST diapers we've tried,"We have used Pampers since our 19 month old was born. From Swaddlers to Baby Dry to now Cruisers with Dry Max. My parents bought these Huggies diapers for my brother's kid who came to visit them, but they didn't end up using them. Figuring not to waste them, they passed them on to us. We used them and it seems like every single time she wears these diapers her onesie undershirt ends up wet or covered in poop. We took her to the dentist the other day and were totally embarrassed about the leaking on both sides of her bottom all the way through her leggings when we went in-- good thing she didn't care! I would never, ever recommend these diapers, nor will I buy Huggies products again. We didn't even purchase them and we regret using them!"
3,As advertised,Besides the great price for an already known brand there is not much to day other that this diapers have been used by both my kids and they seem to do a decent job. Only concern is that it seems that advised weights do not match. My kid is not near 27 pound however previous size won't work anymore.
1,Lower quality compared to off-line store,"I usually bought Huggies from W*lmart or T*rget and they had been all OK.But with a surprisingly good price, I bought huggies from this site, I found that this diapers had a very suspicious quality.At first sight, the printed pictures on the diapers are different from Off-line store's.Second, blue color from the pictures are stained on the baby's clothes.Third, the thickness of diapers are different from off-line store's. They are thinner than off-line store's.At conclusion, It reminds me that the cheaper is the worse.I will not buy huggies from this site again."
1,Crystals on baby's bottom!,"I wasn't happy with these diapers. They arrived with a small dent in the box though the diaper packages were intact, but the individual diapers somewhat stuck together on opening - when I unfolded a diaper I almost had to peel the diaper apart. Furthermore, when we went to do diaper changes I found crystals on my baby's bottom. I am normally a cloth diaper user so these are my backups for trips, needless to say I am not planning to purchase Huggies Snug and Dry as my backup diapers in the future."
5,I love these diapers!,I have one little boy and I've tried several different diaper brands. Huggies have been my favorite diapers to use. They don't leak or feel flimsy when they are soaked.
1,"Leak, Leak, Leak!","The diaper looks good with waist band, but don't be fooled. It can not hold too much urination. I got leakage twice in the past 3 days during sleep time, even I changed the diaper before putting my baby in her bed. The cloth and bed sheet were all wet when I got her up after 3-hour sleep. I never had this problem when I used pamper swaddler sensitive at new born size, even though she had more urination at those time. I have over 160 huggies size 1-2 I want to throw it away!!"
5,Always great!,I love huggies! FYI Huggies always seems to run smaller than Pampers. So they are always a good diaper to have when you start to have those leaks (hint: time for the next size up). These diapers are soft and have the little flap in the back to catch...BIG leaks! And buying them on amazon is always cheaper (sign up for amazonmom!) than any store. Two thumbs up!
4,great product,Great product. I give 4 stars because it is not as great as the one with the leak indicator. But the price is good. I just ordered another box two days ago.
4,work well,"I have tried all of the diapers out there, and my kids pee A LOT, and Huggies seems to be the only one that absorbs majority of it or my daughter will be a little wet in the morning. But nothing like pampers and esp Luvs, they are terrible at handling a large overnight load of pee. My daughter would be drenched in urine when I had her in those diapers. There have only been a handful of times when she has woken up in the morning slightly damp while wearing the huggies. Great product overall."
5,Huggies Diapers,I love buying diapers in bulk and having them delivered to my front door. So hum-bum to have to cart them from the store to the car to the house.
4,Subscribe and Save - FYI,"Subscribe and save works, and it does save you money, but be aware that Amazon will charge your account a day or two early. If you use an envelope system, and don't have money in the bank account, either use your credit card, or push the date back a few days. ie: if you get paid on the 15th, and you have it set to ship on the 15th, they might charge your account on the 13th or 14th."
5,Huggies Snug & Dry Size 4,"I like Huggies Diapers, because they are good quality diapers that don't cause skin irritation for my kids and generally don't leak overnight. I've compared prices and Amazon is the best place to purchase them."
4,Great absorbers but leaves blue dye on baby,"This is a great soft yet absorbent diaper. It is a reasonably priced and is a great substitute for Pampers. We were avid pampers sensitive users until we got to size 3 when the wetness indicator is taken away and the absorbent material inside the diaper switches to ""drymax"" which is has a terrible chemical scent and is NOT very good at absorbing. We had many leaks...especially overnight so the switch to Huggies went well. The fit is also very good with lots of room to grow but inner liner prevents leaks. My only problem with these diapers has been transfer of the blue dye from the inner liner onto my baby's thighs and some of the colored dye from the front of the diaper onto my baby's white clothes. Happens a lot more when we have to use diaper cream for her. Other than this issue...it's a great diaper."
5,Great deal!,"Good price, great diapers and great count! I love that I can order these and have them shipped directly to the door."
2,Can't tell if they are wet,When these diapers are wet they get hard instead of squishy like pampers. These diapers already have a bit of a solid feel to them so getting hard makes it hard to tell if they need changed. I'm sticking to Pampers.
4,I am very pleased with the product,"Great diapers for great price! I usually bought them at local supermarkets and try to collect coupons to get best price, but then I saw the subscription option on Amazon which made me felt WOW. And they are delivered free. Double WOW. I am so happy with this product, and my decision to subscribe from Amazon. Totally worth it!"
3,"Ehh, no good","I dont know how others have experienced this when using these diapers, however when I did, I found while changing my son there was a jelly like substance all over him and in the diaper, also found they seem to fall apart sometimes."
1,LEAKY!,"Someone purchased a case of these diapers for us at our baby shower. I've tried multiple brands of diapers (including store brands) and none have given us as many leaks as these diapers. Huggies have leaked on us 4 times now, with only using about 20 of them. That's too many leaks for me! I do have a son, and it seems people with little girls like these diapers. Maybe there just isn't enough wetness protection in the front? One of the diapers even came unvelcroed, which we've never had happen with any other diaper. I'm sure these work well for some, but they didn't for us. We now have about 170 diapers that we can't use, which goes against all my ""smart shopper sensibilities"". However, having to do an entire outfit change and bath every few diaper changes goes against the retention of my sanity (especially with the sleep deprivation that comes with a newborn - I don't want any more work than necessary). Unfortunately, can't recommend these!"
4,"diapers, diapers, and more diapers",This is a good size diaper box. I hate having to keep buying little boxes of diapers. They Huggies are good.
2,it smells a plastic,"These diapers have a strong plastic odor or a chemical. After using Natural Care ( from Huggies too), I think it was a mistake switch to this kind of diaper, I would not recommend it."
1,bad rash,"My baby girl went up a size in diapers last week, so I bought a package of huggies snug and dry from Sam's Club. After 4 days of using these my daughter had a bright red rectangle shaped rash that was hot to the touch and caused her to sob while wiping her. I stopped using these diapers, cloth diapered her for the day and she is now in Seventh Generation. The rash is fading. It was not diaper rash, it was from these diapers. I took them back to Sam's Club. Previously, I had been using Huggies Little Snugglers which worked fine but are not in a size 3. I will never buy these type of diapers again."
1,HUGGIES,You can get 228 size three diapers at Sam's club for 39.98. They will even ship them on line free of charge.
5,Too many,I bought this product because it was a great price for how many you receive but my child outgrew them before I was half through the box so it was way too many for us.
1,Diapers leak!,"I am a first time mon and my daughter uses size 3, she 19 lbs and she's had so many diaper leaks... It's not even funny... I change have to change it constantly to avail the leaks. I personally do not like these diapers. I will not recommend them."
3,Great Diapers - Frustrating Sizing,"These are size 1 diapers. the next size available on Amazon is Size 3. Just because the package says Size 1-2 doesn't make these any bigger. So, I am back to buying diapers at the grocery store again after my daughter grew out of the size 1 (she is not yet in the size 3).I love these diapers. I just wish size 2 was available."
3,Will think twice before purchasing again.,"I was excited to try Huggies, but was a bit dissapointed with some aspects of the diaper. It is an absorbent diaper and I was happy there were no leaks, but the diaper designs stained ALL my baby's onesies, tights and even some diaper covers. The white onesies are ""ruined"". I also didn't like that the diapers don't neutralize the pee or poo smells. This would be convenient when we are in church or other public places."
1,The Worst Product My Family Has Ever Bought.,"We bought these Huggies for my one-year-old, and they turned out to be a nightmare. They fail to hold his leakages. Every morning, we have to change his bedding covers, not to mention that we have to bathe him entirely. Furthermore, these diapers did not come cheap. They were quite expensive. We are asking that Huggies either refund us the money or mail us a new product, one which meets quality standards, etc. We are saddened that our consumer agencies are not doing their job to ensure that we, Americans, are fully protected against defective products such as these and a plethora of others. Buyer be ware!!!!If Huggies does not respond to our grievance, we will report them to the Better Business Bureau along with the Federal Trade Commision."
5,"Great quality, great deal.","I bought these with the [...] promotional offer.Great quality, great deal. Could'nt be happier."
3,Huggies Diapers,"Overall, I was not satisfied with this product. I had to switch to Pampers or huggies supreme. I had used these diapers since my daughter was born in December and was very happy with them until recently. They started to leak when she was asleep. Also, the liners were all stuck together when I received my order. The company did, however, send me coupons for free diapers."
5,Not as good as Pampers but the next best thing.,"AWesome deal once again with Amazon.com. I did the subscribe and save option for these diapers which gave me free chipping and a really really good deal. I love Huggies, not as much ans pampers diapers but for the price they are worth it."
4,Great deal with Amazon mom!,"Huggies are the best diapers I have found for my kids, and I love that I can get such a great deal with Amazon mom subscription! It's so easy to use, and I'm getting a better price per diaper than going through a membership club like Sams or Costco, AND I'm getting the name brand that I love!"
5,Good Diapers,These diapers provide great leak protection. Works well with my daughter. These are one of the best diapers out there for me.
2,Huggies CHANGED,"I have been a die hard Huggies user since my son came home 6 months ago. We tried everything else, but that elastic in the back just makes for a better fit. Unfortunately, though, this last shipment I received was NOT the same diaper I've been using. There is now blue dye inside the diaper (one of the biggest pros for me was dye free next to his skin). They are also considerably larger than the last box of 4's. The outside is softer now, which is nice, but they're just flimsy. I think changes like these should have been announced beforehand, giving me a choice, instead of just shipping this new crap."
5,Great product,"I used Pampers, Parents' choice, Luvs and several other brands for my three kids. This is the best brand and best price for quality pampers. I checked with several stores including Costco. But Amazon subscribe and save offers the best deal."
3,Not a fan,"I purchased these stupidly thinking there were size 1 AND size 2 diapers inside. The diapers are actually an inbetween size 1-2. My baby started wearing these at over 9 lbs close to 10 pounds and was 21 inches long. These diapers hung at least a good 2 inches down no matter how high I yiked them up. They are also very flimsy feeling. They held up most of the time, but she did have a few accidents. I went out and bought more of the Little Snugglers, which I was originally using on her when she was newborn size instead. There is no comparison. Little Snugglers are made so much better, she doesn't have accidents and they don't hang and look like she has a load in her diaper all the time. Since I'm stuck with a gigantic box of these, when she gains a little more weight I'll put her back in these and then continue buying the other ones."
3,Huggies snug and dry size 3,"I buy this all the time, but for some reasons, these were not good huggies. Each one were bunched up in the front of the diapers. Therefore causing leaks. The price is very good under the subscribe and save, plus free shipping. excellent way to bring products to the home,"
1,Diapers left ink marks on baby,There were many diapers in my pack that would leave ink stains on my baby's legs and bottom - it looked like bruises with the blue ink from Micky! Whatever they are using for the chemical ink rubs off and can't be safe! I am sticking to pampers or the target brand - both are great.
1,Poor Quality Control,"We had switched from Pampers to Huggies cause the Huggies seemed to do a better job now that the baby was running around and they were working great for a couple of months. The last case we bought, the tabs were all covered in fuzz and wouldn't stick to the diaper. Sometimes it would take 2 or 3 diapers to find one that stayed closed."
2,Fell apart and stained clothing,I love the protection this diaper offers. We got our first shipment and everything was perfect. I was so excited to find such a deal on amazon.com. Then the second shipment came and the diapers pretty much fell apart. It felt like gritty sand and this substance was falling out of the diapers. It would be all over my son when he'd wear them. There was one diaper that the insides just fell out when I picked it up. This may have just been a fluke but I went through each diaper and had to throw away nearly the entire box. The Disney pattern also stained his onesies.
5,"Great Deal, Fast Shipping",The diapers got here really quickly and they were such a great deal! I love Huggies diapers because we almost never have leaks (it is inevitable unfortunately) and they are a perfect fit! Definitely buying them again.
4,great value for the money,"I have tried Pampers, but have come back to these. The main reason is the elastic band at the top is helping prevent the blow-outs. There have been occasional leaks but much less frequently than Pampers.Little Movers are softer and slightly smaller"
2,Too small for my 10 lbs. baby!,"These Huggies Size 1-2 diapers were too small for my 10 lbs. baby daughter. That caused BMs to overflow and make a huge mess. Very disappointing. This size was adequate for other purposes, but not for BMs."
3,Amazon price hike should stop!,"Huggies diapers are very nice. However, Amazon keeps increase its price after they ""hook"" you on the subscription with an attractive offer. Now, their price is no better than elsewhere. I am not sure if I am happy with how the ""subscribe and save"" thing works because they can change their price at any time."
3,very average product,"i ordered these diapers because at the time the subscribe and save option made the price only about $22 shipped, then the weight advertised states that it can fit a baby up to 15lbs. my son at the time weight about 13lbs when i ordered these and they were snug. by the time he was at 14lbs, the diapers were just a struggle to get the tabs on him and up high enough so that it'll stay on. the diapers also feel very cheap and papery which was nothing that i expected from huggies. i'm going to stick with pampers and luvs which has a better deal right now anyways. i think that if huggies made it less misleading and lowered the weight down to about 12lbs it would get reviews because the product would be advertised more accurately. unfortunately, these are more like a large ish size 1 diaper not quite a size 2."
3,Guess I have a Pampers baby....,"I've tried all the diapers...Pampers, Huggies, Luvs. I bought these because of a rebate. I can't wait to run out of my big pack of 144. My 9-month old hasn't had problems with leaks for months...now it happens every time! We will stick with Pampers in the future."
2,Magical Gigglastic Leaking Waistband,"My 20 month old daughter is 24 pounds and this product appears to be too small. The side bands do not have the capability to fully ""touch"" from front to back so evertime she had a loose bowel movement... you guessed it. They leaked.They may be okay for children on the light end of the recommended weight scale, but they were not sufficient for my needs."
5,to the person that said they leak after 3 hours,"well, after 3 hours of not changing them - you wonder why your baby got a diaper rash? i didnt think i'd write a review about a diaper - but, common now - common sense would tell you that sitting in your own pee for 3 hours would cause a rash! need i say more? (diapers can only hold so much liquid - no matter what the brand!) but, huggies does rule!"
1,Not comparable to Little Movers,I was not happy with these diapers. I was receiving Huggies Little Movers until Amazon took them off of subscribe and save. I was hoping these would work just as well for my 23 lb 11 month old and I could keep getting them continuously once a month. Unfortunately they left a huge rash on my daughters back and lower bottom. They also leaked very quickly. I cancelled my subscription and decided to just get the Little Movers from Diapers.com.
4,"Good product, using it for 2nd one...","Good product, Using it for 2nd kid too. Only issue with diaper is rashes. Tried other product but didn't like it."
1,Poopie Leakage,"My baby is [...] and weighs 11 lbs. When I used this diaper, no matter how tight I put it on, his poopie would leak out of the diaper and make a mess everywhere. Not sure if it's the diaper, but when I use Pampers (similar size), I do not have this problem."
1,TOO LATE!,I'm really surprized to have this happen! and without prior notice. Item was ordered almost a week ago and till not it is not even shipped! it's delivery estimate is in 3 weeks!!!I'm not used to this from Amazon!
3,They're Okay,"These diapers I would put in second place versus Pampers but definitely stay away from the Supreme. They don't hold enough liquid causing a leak and the elastic was always falling apart. So i stick with pampers, but Huggies wipes are better."
1,Low Quality ....Do not buy online ..BUy from stores,"My kid has been using Huggies for over a year and I used to buy in stores and they were pretty OK.However, for last 2 months ,I bought them online on Amazon and believe they are worst, quality is poor. And these diapers are not good for skin, my kid has developed rashes and I had to take her to the doctor.Think twice before you buy them online. You may save some dollars but you end up getting low quality diapers and trouble to your kids.Well, I dont intent to say all the bad things about Huggies. When I ordered them online, I received them in 2-3 days."
1,No Packaging At All,I do not have a covered porch and came home to the diaper box sitting out in the rain. There was no additional wrapping to the package. The Huggies box was all there was. It literally looked like it had been pulled from the store shelf and placed on my porch. Fortunately the diapers are wrapped in plastic and were fine.
1,Not genuine huggies?,"These huggies I bought aren't the same as the ones I purchase at the store. The ink on the outside of the diapers is really bold, and I was afraid it would stain my kids clothes. In addition, as another poster has mentioned, the size 6 sold from amazon are bulkier than the ones sold in stores. They do not seem genuine huggies or they're made somewhere else, I have no idea.Due to the ink amount I decided not to use these diapers as I wasn't sure if they would cause a diaper rash for my son."
5,Excellent service!,I save so much money when I buy my baby's diapers from here and they always ship within 3-4 days.
2,Huggies Size 1-2: Misleading!,"If you are expecting diapers which are larger than size 1 but smaller than size 2 - forget it! There are regular size 1 diapers in this box! No joke, I called Kimberly Clark to confirm. Don't be duped."
5,Huggies are the best!,"These diapers, when put on properly, capture and retain the moisture better than other brands."
1,Stay away from this product.,"This is the worst quality diaper i have ever seen. Stay away from this product. I wish i could have returned this product, but could not as at is Internet order."
2,Snug & WET,"I really dislike these diapers. I don't get the lack of overlap on the waistband tabs or why the inside elastic has to be pulled out as some reviewers have suggested in order to work. Mostly though, they just suck at keeping my 7 month old son dry. He has at least 1 leak everyday - whether it's after a 2 hour nap (not being active) or playing on the floor for a couple of hours, he pees his onesie and shorts. They are also pretty rough. At least they don't stink like some other diapers. Going to try Huggies Little Movers next and give Pampers Cruisers another shot..."
4,Better for sensitive skin,"I have to say I preferred Luvs as far as leak protection goes and price as well, but my daughter has sensitive skin and a lot of allergies and with the Luvs she would claw at her bottom anytime the diaper was off. Pampers were the same way. Something about the chemicals used just made her skin itchy. Luckily Huggies have no such problems. I agree with those who say to pull the leg elastic out - it is imperative if you want good leak protection. When I do that we have very little problem. So we're Huggies fans for now. Also, as a side note Kirtland Signature (Costco brand) diapers are actually the Huggies little movers/snugglers. We compared, they are the exact same without the Disney character. So that might be a way to go if you have a costco memembership."
1,Not at all like Little Snugglers! Horrible diapers!,"I used Huggies Little Snugglers since birth for my daughter. Now that she's a size 3, all that was available was Snug & Dry--NOT AT ALL the same product. This feels like a much cheaper diaper, with a scratchy/gritty feel and a yucky chemical smell. I will not buy them again."
4,"Pretty good, but not as soft as other diapers","We use these diapers in combination with the huggies pure and natural. We started with the pampers swaddlers which are great, until my son's BMs started going up the back of the diaper. That's when we switched over to huggies because we love the elastic in the back. It has kept many ""near misses"" at bay. I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 because they are not as soft as the huggies pure and natural or pampers. We won't put our son in these overnight, because he will get occasional chaffing from the edges. We try to alternate with the softer pure and natural diapers during the day so there's never any chaffing. Once I did find a plastic thread sticking out of the diaper. They are less expensive than the other huggies diapers, so good product for the cost, although it's not as convenient keeping 2 stacks of different diapers around (since we use another diaper for night time)."
2,leaky for a 2yr old,I got these for my 2 year old daughter. They leak so much easier than her Pampers. I have to change her clothes b/c of leakage almost every day. I have to change her much more often than I did while using Pampers. Thought I'd try Huggies but now I know not to do that again. Not at all happy with them and will def. not be buying them again.
4,Diaper Daze,"These are great diapers. The Huggies Supreme have a better fit, but only slightly. And for the price the Huggies are just fine. My little girls prefers the Lion King characters to any others, too."
2,"Huggies is expensive, but not that good","Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers, Size 4, Giant Pack, 140 Countit leaks, and does not absorb as good as pampers. I wont buy it anymore"
5,Great deal!,"Having a little baby, it's amazing to get diapers deliver to your door and it's better deal than any other retail store!!I definately buy this again!Diapers are brand new, perfect condition!!"
3,leaks when baby grows,"My daughter started off using a size 4 and it was great. After a while she grew out of it and we turned to a size 6, but that didnt fit her so well. There were leakages no matter how tight we put it on. A leakage will make a mess everywhere and stinks pretty badly."
4,great fit,"My baby girl is 7 weeks, these fit great and will probably fit for one more month. However you can feel the wetness (not so good during the night)."
4,Love getting Huggies!,"The Huggies diapers fit my son the best out of all the brands we tried. While I REALLY love the Huggies Supreme, because they are so soft and less irritable, I usually get the baby-fit because of the price. Here on Amazon using the subscribe and save I am able to get them at a great price! I really shopped around, and unless I joined a wholesale shopping club like Sams or BJs, this was the best deal I could find. Plus they deliver it for free right to my door and I don't have to think about it."
3,Better off with little movers,"This product leaves a blue tint on the skin, I switched to Little Movers. Finding blue tint between your baby's legs is scary."
1,Leaky,"I know other moms that haven't had any problems but for me and my little guy, it is not the best. He leaks out if them the tabs break easily and he seems to get more diaper rash. They are less costly but you get what you pay for."
5,Great buy!,Great buy! More diapers and less per diaper than wholesale stores. Very absorbable and fit my daughter great! Will buy again
2,Where was the leak guard on the back?,"I love Huggies because of the leak guard on the back. I was using Pampers but was having problems with explosions out the back of the diaper. Someone gave us Huggies size 2 diapers (Snug & Dry) and they had a leak guard on the back that stopped a lot of potentially dangerous explosions. I was so happy to have had those diapers on a flight and I was singing Huggies' praises to everyone I met.But I bought these size 3 Huggies Snug & Dry on Amazon and they do not have a leak guard in the back. They have the snug waistband, but not that extra guard, which was the ONLY reason I loved Huggies. Without that leak guard, I might as well get just about any other brand. I have had several leaks out the back now and only since opening this box.I checked on the Huggies website and they advertise that these diapers should also have the leak guard on the back...so where is it?"
3,they used to be so much better,Several years ago huggies were the best you could buy. Now they leak so easily and are no where as good as they were before. I'm switching back to luvs.
3,Huggies Diapers,I is very good compared to others I find that it helps against baby rashes but they still need to improve it when the baby made big it leaked out thru the sides.
5,They work,What do you say about these other than they work. This site requires so many words so trying to find something more to say. LOL
4,Better than others!,"I prefer swaddlers, but regardless, Huggies is better than all other brands! Seems thin, but seems to do the trick!"
4,Size Matters,"We have used both Pampers and Huggies. My first daughter was larger and chunkier and Pampers worked very well, while Huggies leaked. My second daughter is very slim. Huggies work very well and Pampers leak. This is more or less what I have discovered with my friends' kids as well. Both brands are fine, it just depends on what fits your child better."
5,diapers,They showed up the next day on my door step. It was definatly better then having to drive and fight through the store to get them.
4,"What works, works.","The consistent quality and fit of Huggies keeps me as a customer for my daughter's very active 10-month-old butt. It handles the nightly poop-a-thons and the long days of busy-baby romping. The comfortable compromise between softness, durability, and price point make this diaper my go-to choice.Do I wish it was a cheap as the ultra-generics? Yes, but using my Amazon Mom subscription has really knocked down the cost. I've had two boxes shipped to my door for the price of $44. Hard to beat that!My one compliant about the diaper is that it seems to run small. At 19 lbs, my daughter gets the occasional wedgie with these supposed 16-28 lbs diapers. I am sure that she will be out of these long before she hits the weight max."
2,Not for Babies with sensitive skin!,"If your baby does have sensitive skin, I do not recommend these! My daughter (now 15 months) developed a HORRIBLE diaper rash wearing the size 4 diaper snug and dry. She's never had a rash before - I am always careful about giving her bum lots of air and using Eucerin, frequent changing, etc. They are a great price, super cute, but they don't let a babies skin breath whatsoever. I switched diapers and viola, the rash was gone. My daughter does have very sensitive skin I should add and these diapers did prevent leaks. If your baby has some skin issues, I would recommend the Huggies Natural line - works great!"
3,not the best for big blowouts,While I find these diaper help keep the moisture away from my little boy (Size 1-2) the messy blowouts escape on occasion. I much prefer the little snugglers or Luvs for blowout prevention.
2,Not one of my Favorite diapers,I have tried several types of diapers. These are one of my least favorites. While they are not bad as far as protecting leaks. I don't like the way the diaper looks once it is wet. It looks very uncomfortable to me and is rather hard. My son is always on the go and needs a diaper that moves with him.
3,pampers are better,my wife decided o try huggies just to try them out so we did the first day we got them the tabs ripped on 2 diapers just the first day. will not recommend are cheaply made.
3,just ok,"they are a little scratchy and they let out the jelly too easily. when i change my daughter after she pees, every time there is jelly all over. Normally we use the snugglers and that doesnt happen"
5,Best baby diapers. Keep bums drier longer!,"We haven't tried them all but Snug and Dry's keep baby drier, longer than the others we've tried. Best disposables we've ever used during our two kid's baby-hood."
3,New snug and dry diapers suck!,"This used to be a rave review of huggies, but I have to edit it. They changed the snug and dry diapers, and now they leavel little gel beads all over my daughter. I change her constantly and it still happens! I was told that it is fine andit doesn't harm my child, but even if it is fine, I still don't want whatever that stuff is on my child's most sensitive areas! If Im worried about keeping moisture away from my baby's skin, I will change her diaper, I don't appreciate huggies adding this to their snug and dry diapers. I hate the residue and it is so hard to wipe off! I switched to little movers since. I really do love huggies diapers, I just wish they would change the snug and dry back since it fits my budget a little better!"
2,Can you say BLISTERS,I was using another diaper but have used Huggies little movers in the past and have been very satisfies...when i bought the Snug DRY i thought there would be no problem. I ordered the Size 4 which is a size larger than my girls technically are because Huggies tends to run small. I put the dipaers on at 11am and changed it at 1pm and one of my girls ( the one with the more sensitive skin) had a HUGH BLISTER on her Butt Fold area and a rash around the waist band. I am very unhappy and called Huggies right away. They said they would refund me my money if I sent back the diapers. I am satisfied with their service but not the diaper. I do have to say that I have twins and one girl had no problem..but if you have a baby/toddler with sensitive skin or any type of eczema- Do not use this diaper. Good Luck!
2,Not a fan but I'm stuck.,"Not the best diapers around the only 2 things that keep me buying over and over are the good Amazon Mom price and accumulating Huggies reward points. A cut better than Pampers - kinder on skin, unfragranced, and don't sag as much - Huggies diapers I think are best on newborns till when baby is learning to walk, so they don't sag and they hold a good amount of waste. I love the elasticized back that helps to contain less than solid poop within. However for toddlers, these diapers sag when a quarter full. The leg elastics are so stretchy they just give and give. Thankfully the side velcro tabs aren't that stretchy or the diaper will fall off as what I've experienced with Pampers, these will only stretch so far and then it stops stretching."
1,Very disappointed,"Even though these are labeled size 1 and 2 diapers, they are most certainly not! They run very small! It says up to 15 lbs but not the case. My 6 week old (11 lbs) outgrew these and couldn't use them. Labeling is very misleading!!!"
5,Diaper Deals,Our latest granddaughter needed diapers in a hurry. I was told by a friend who works for pg that Amazon was the best place to buy diapers. We buy Huggies and save 30% and they are delivered right to the house.This is convenient and saves gas too.
1,Discoloration on a skin....,I have been using Huggies from the very beginning with our twin boys. Huggies from this seller have been staining their inner thighs blue. The blue discoloration only comes off after much scrubbing. We've never had this problem before with Huggies:-((((
4,Excellent Diapers,When our baby was born this past spring we started out with Amazon's Subscribe and Save program using Pampers Baby Dry. Not too long after using these diapers I noticed how wet they felt on the OUTSIDE - especially when baby got up in the morning. I had thought the diapers claimed to be dry for 12 hours so I was quite surprised. These diapers also easily leaked up the back with bowel movements (since there was no elastic around the top back). After reading reviews I decided to try the Huggies Snug & Dry. These diapers have been great! Feel much drier over night and all around. I'd say big step up!
1,Hate these diapers,We've been using Costco diapers for 18 months but got a good deal and couldn't pass it up. I'm sorry I did because these diapers leak. They have too much papery stuff around the edges and too little padded area to absorb pee. It's also hard to get these put on correctly because there's so much papery edging. I'll never buy them again.
2,Ok diapers,"Be careful when ordering the size 1/2 diapers. They are not as big as size 2. My baby weighed 12 lbs, which is within the limits in the description, but they didn't fit. They would work better for a baby in size 1. They were a waste of money because I can't use them. They're good diapers if you get the right size."
2,Not worth the constant leaking....,"Our little guy has been a Pampers wearer since birth. We took a risk going with Huggies. Unfortunately the great price isn't enough to keep us buying. The first thing I noticed was the size...smaller than size one Pampers. Secondly was the leaking. They just don't hold the urine! I expect to change blowouts that leak....but todays diapers should hold daytime pee! I am constantly changing diapers that leak....with hardly any urine. So even though I bought a lot of diapers for a great price, changing so often makes the price negligible. For reference I have a long and lean little guy!"
3,too tight on the thighs,love the absorbancy and price but they are too snug on the thighs and my baby is only average size..the last time I bpought these i had to stop using the last 75 diapers...have tried the new pampers as well.. though more expensive i feel they fit better..
2,Not leakproof,"I don't know if this is standard or I recieved a bad box, but the seat of my baby's pants is always damp! Like the diaper isn't totally waterproof. We usually use Up&Up and have never had that problem. Aside from that, they fit him well and seem comfortable. I won't be buying them again though, and only use these for when I know he can be changed within an hour or so, otherwise he'll need new pants."
3,Huggies Snug & Dry,"I used Huggies when my daughter was a newborn and hated them. She had blow outs left and right. I was told they are much better when they get into size 3 and up. She's in a size 4 so I bought a small pack to try them out and they were fine. I don't know if because she's now eating more food and drinking, but she is have leaks every time we turn around. I must now switch back to the more expensive Pampers :("
3,Getting too expensive,Nice diaper but too expensive now. Originally got these at $22 for our grandson with Subscribe & Save but the price keeps going up. Now at nearly $30 it's no longer an option - back to generic...
3,"Ok product, didn't work for my baby","Everything from seller side is great, packaging, shipping etc. I just dint like the product itself. My baby didn't do well with it. I felt it is not as absorbent as pampers swaddlers and it doesn't have the wetness indicator. It also felt rough and not dry My baby got more frequent diaper rashes with Huggies than Pampers. This is my first and last box of Huggies diapers. I love pampers and have been using it ever since."
2,Craptacular!,"I've raved about the Gigglastic in the past and truly thought Huggies made a quality product, but now I must change the assessment.With son #1, we fared well with Huggies and their Gigglastic waistbands. We had the occasional ""pee-through"", but nothing out of the ordinary. However, over the past couple of weeks, Huggies has not been able to contain the poo or pee of son #2. The blow out he had in Barnes & Noble last weekend was incredible--the poo ran up his back to his shoulders...amazing! Now, with each diaper change, we must change clothes as well. It defeats the whole purpose.Maybe the Gigglastic is better for the larger sizes. I don't know. It's unfortunate, because I want my son to giggle...with these diapers, I'm afraid it's impossible."
5,Huggies Diapers,"These are the best diapers! I am on kid #2 and have been so pleased that we just don't have leaks with these diapers. The price is great, no tax, and no shipping. Can't beat that."
1,A waste of money,"When my son was born we tried every brand of diaper. We went through our ""Huggies"" pack very quickly because about every third diaper the tab would rip off. We even bought a second pack because we thought we may have gotten a defective bunch. The same thing happened. It's a waste of money and also a waste of time. (Time is pretty precious when you are up every two hours or so with a newborn baby.) When I started to tell my sister about it, she cut me off and said ""let me guess, the tabs rip off, right?"" Apparently her and her friends have all experienced the same thing. We settled with Pampers and I haven't lost a tab since. Stay away from Huggies if you don't like throwing your money away."
5,Happy Camper,"I set this item up for delivery for my grandson at his home address several months ago. The diapers are great. He has sensitive skin and can only wear select brands of diapers - this being one of the best. It's so convenient to have them re-ordered and shipped without me having to do anything. Also, the discount on the price can't be beat! Thanks Amazon!!! :)"
5,Good Diapers,Best diapers for my toddler. I received the box in two days. And thee price is the best compare to the supermarket prices.
2,Not the Best,"I've tried several different brands of diapers and these are NOT my favorite. They leak a lot, both urine and poo. The inner lining on these is stuck down and the diaper is not very well made in-general. (Found some reject diapers in each package) Pulling up the inner lining helped a little bit with leakage, but we still have leaking issues. I don't recommend these unless you don't mind having pee and poo leak everywhere. lol"
4,good fit for narrow hipped babies,"When our son was born, he was 8 lbs, 6 oz, and Pampers Swaddlers Newborn fit him very well. After two weeks, the baby was 9.5 lbs and had outgrown newborn size. The Swaddlers size 1 were not a good fit, too low waisted for him and had a leaking problem. The Huggies Size 1 baby shaped with gigglastic waistband had elastic in the back so they were better at containing the contents. Fewer leaks, though still some urine leaks. Never a blowout leak.The one gripe - the velcro tabs stick to his fleece sleeper sack so occasionally you have to check to make sure the diaper is still secure.Caution - the diapers appear too small to last up to 14 lbs despite the labeling of 8-14 lbs."
1,Huggies- please return to old diaper style!!,"We loved Snug and Dry diapers until they updated to a new look. There's two huge problems with the the new diaper- the cyan color transfers to clothing and we received more than one bad batch which just leaked right through. We noticed the ""bad"" ones are manufactured in 2010 and the ones we love are manufactured in 2009. We could tell as soon as we opened the package that the diapers looked and felt different. Please return to the old diaper model! We're be switching to another brand until then."
1,Bad batch of diapers - will ruin clothing,"I have used Huggies for four years and two children and have been very happy... until recently. The Disney Babies pattern is terrible. The dyes rub off on the baby's clothing, staining onsies (and all else that touches the diaper) blue. It does not come off in the wash. You will ruin clothing with these."
4,Good if they are used properly,"I bought the diapers because they offer $50 rebate on an $100 order. I have tried Pampers, White Clouds and IUV before. Huggies was not impressive at first since I got a few incidents of leaking. My wife figured out that I have to open the folded wings of the dippers very well and align it very well on my baby. It's not too hard to do and I never had any problems ever since. I'm basically satisfied, but I'd expect more when I look at the price tag (before discount)."
3,What's with the ever-rising Subscribe & Save price??,"The diapers themselves are great, as Huggies are the only brand I have found to have a back elastic. However, the Subscribe & save price has continued to rise each month. Three months ago I was paying .12 per diaper, but now they are up to .19 per diaper!!! I guess I'm going to be switching back to Target diapers..."
3,Size was the only issue. for diapers 1-2,"The diapers of size 1-2 are actually only size 1. they were a little small. My child weighs 13 lbs and they seemed to be small, I don't see how it would fit a 15lb baby. I would still recomend pampers somehow."
2,Blue Dye Problem,"I've been using Huggies for a few years (with my first baby and now my second). Recently, I've noticed what look like blue bruises on my 18 month old baby's thighs. They were pretty ugly looking, but they didn't appear to bother her. Upon further research, I found a lot of parents with the same issue posting in various online communities. The common denominator appears to be Huggies Diapers. The dye from these diapers rubs off and absorbs into baby's skin. The dye doesn't wash off in the bath and only comes off with rubbing alcohol. I won't be using Huggies anymore. Amazon was very accomodating and refunded me for my last shipment of diapers - great customer service."
4,Great present!,"My sister is a die hard Huggies fan, so it really was no contest to buy this for her as a baby gift."
5,Huggies 1-2 diapers,"Great deal. The diaper size is just as it stated. We were very pleased with these diapers. We got them the next day we ordered them. Thanks ,Amazon!"
3,First time mom,Overall it is great. it contains well. Couple times of leakage due the baby's position (my daughter was in the sitting position when she is making a mess). The price at Amazon is a bargain.
2,Not for overnight,Purchased these diapers to use for my 3 year old who only needs to wear a diaper at night. Usually buggies work just fine but these do not work well. 8/10 times he wakes up with wet clothes even though he hardly peed. I will not buy these again for night time use.
3,Holy blow outs!,"My first son could not sure Huggies because oddly enough, they gave him a rash. With my 2nd that's what they used at the hospital so I stuck with them. We started out with Little Snugglers which seemed to be better because they have a quilted pattern on the inside to keep the contents actually inside the diaper. However, my 2nd son is a super pooper and has seemed to have massive blow outs in the Snug N Dry almost every single time. I'm lucky enough to ""know"" most of the time when he's going to go so I won't be out and about when this happens but it's such a pain! I like the shape, fit, and design however and they do seem to be a bit smaller VS other brands. All and all not bad."
3,It really leaks!!,"I should have listened to the other reviews! I wanted to try it though, but truly, the diaper really leaks. My baby was on my bed both times her diaper leaked and it was wet all over. The price was very good but I will switch back to Pampers definitely!"
2,huggiea snug & Dry diapers size 5,"I have been using huggies for almost 3 yrs for my twin girls, but the latest one it felt different that a normal ...not sure why. they stick together way more than usual and have a rougher texture, and hard....like they are of poorer quality. I hope they will change it, maybe more softness."
2,Leak out the back (and onto baby's clothes),"I don't know how many times I've shouted ""I hate Huggies"". Practically everytime my daughter has pooped. Everytime I would see that face, I would cringe and reach for the back of the diaper to try to contain the mess. No kidding, practically every time she pooped, it came out the back of the diaper and onto whatever she was wearing (and whatever was around that). They were great for pee and overnight pee, but I shouldn't have to panic everytime I see her about to poop while she is wearing a diaper!Note also: I switched to Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive which, for the most part, contained the poop, but gave my daughter a horrible rash. I think I prefer leaking to hurting my baby, but I'll have to shop around and find something else."
3,New design is not so good...,I love Huggies & have used them for all of my children. Unfortunately they have changed there design print on the diapers. It has a lot of blue in the design & leaves what looks like bruises on the inner thighs of my baby. Not so good... I was very worried the 1st time I saw it but thankfully it did fade in the bathtub. Will not purchase again until they change the design.
3,Not snug enough,"Up until now I've had a lot of success with Huggies brand products. But I have to say that the fit on these diapers is a bit on the ""irregular"" side. My little one has had a few more accidents than were had w/previous sizes: leaking around the legs and around the waist (while asleep in the crib)."
2,Okay if you're homebound,"I have a 2 yr old and an 8mo. old, so I know how hard it is to get out of the house to buy diapers (or anything else). I bought these in a pinch, but you can get a much better price at Sam's."
3,I remember these being better,I was not thrilled with my box of huggies. I remember them being less leaky. They also seem to irritate DD's skin. I've had better luck with the Huggies Little Movers. Maybe we've gotten spoiled over time.
3,Not as good as pampers,We are frequent buyers of Pampers Cruisers. I decided to try at least one pack of Huggies before my son grows out of diapers. They do a great job from leaking (so do Pampers) but are not as near as soft or comfortable for him. He's constant itching his lower back and you can actually hear the diaper crinkle and crackle as he bends over or runs across the floor. We will be sticking with Pampers from now on just for the mere softness and comfortability!
1,Terrible,"I bought these diapers because I ran out the Nature Babycare diapers and was waiting for an amazon shipment. I bought them yesterday morning. I started noticing redness but not enought to call it diaper rash. But throughout the day it got worse. After nighttime, today in the morning, my girl woke up with a raw horrible diaper rash. I would NOT reccomend this diaper."
5,Very Happy with Huggies,"I have used Huggies for both of my boys and have been pleased with them each time. I've tried other brands, but they just do not stay as dry."
5,Huggies do work!,"We have used both Huggies and Pampers for our girls. Both work well, but for the cost Huggies are what we'll stick with. Amazon has the best prices out there on diapers."
1,Subscribers beware!!,"I subscribed to a montlhly purchase because the price was really good. Even better than what we could get at Costco. My wife noticed that the diaper does not hold as much in them as the other brands. I'm not saying that I don't like them because we can't keep our kid in one all day ~but if my son were to pee once AND poop then we are talking overflow here.To make matter worst, Amazon jacks up the price ALOT after a couple of shipments. Sorry, I don't recommend at all!"
2,Don't buy Huggies Baby-Shaped Fit diapers,"Well, go ahead and buy them if you don't mind changing your baby's whole outfit 3-4 times a day!! I am definately disappointed with these. They leak up the back and through the legs everytime my son poops. The reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is only because the urine doesn't leak. Unfortunately, I bought a ton of them when Amazon ran their Huggies $30 off $99 coupon. Take this mom of 5's advice and spend the extra money on Huggies Supremes, or buy Luvs or Pampers instead. In my experience it is very rare to have leaks like this with the Luvs, Pampers or Huggies Supreme. These other brands have a much tighter fitting elastic leg band."
1,Leaked!!! Save money and aggrevation and try the Target brand,"My husband got a 36 pack of Huggies Snug & Dry for about $9 at WalMart during our trip.They leaked two nights in a row. I had to put the baby through diaper changes and it took him 30 minutes to settle back to sleep, and I could not fall back asleep on one of the nights. It was very disturbing for a whole family during our precious vacation days, all because of the leaking diapers!These are neither snug, nor dry. I discovered the Target brand diapers at one of the forums, and after trying them out, I switched completely away from brand name diapers. Target brand are softer (even compare to premium Huggies - the Snugglers -which we used for several months in the beginning), and don't leak. And they are less expensive!"
2,Where's the size 2?,"I too, expected to receive both size 1 & 2 in this box, but I was disappointed to find only size 1. I hope my daughter doesn't outgrow these before we get to use them all."
1,Bad quality,"After some research and good recommendations, I ended up choosing Huggies brand diapers for my son. However, I will not buy Huggies diapers anymore. Their quality couldn't compare to Pampers' (at least to the Swaddlers' which I have been using). The Huggies diapers are very thin, hard and leaks quite often."
2,These diapers leak...,"The diapers feel nice and soft, but the gathers don't go all the way around leg so they have a tendency to leak. I prefer the Pampers diapers because they fit a lot better than the Huggies. They also bunch up in the middle after he wets and look huge and uncomfortable."
1,"Leak, leak, leak!","I don't know what has happened, but ever since I switched my 2 year old son to size 6; he leaks through almost every night! I have been a Huggies fan for all my children, but now I'm thinking I should try something new. I thought that perhaps he was just urinating too much, but when I took it off there wasn't really that much there...not enough to leak like it did. He still sleeps with us and I'm tired of constantly waking up next to a pee spot! Maybe it's a bad batch...who knows."
3,Not the best deal out there,"If you can buy these a Costco, do it. Otherwise, this is a fine deal--just not the best one out there."
5,When the weight rating says 22 pounds.. they mean it.. it will only hold up to that amount,no leaks.. other then last week when my wife changed my sons diaper and forgot to put his fire hose in the diaper... grandpa was baffled when his shirt was all wet...
2,"Love Huggies, but...","Love Huggies, but...buyer beware. When the product description says ""economy"", they mean it! We've used Huggies for the past 2 1/2 years and have been very impressed. We bought these thinking ""hey, this is a great deal. And they're Huggies, so what can go wrong?"" However, at least 1/3 of the diapers in the box were defective and the strip on the sides that attaches the diaper ripped, making them extremely expensive per diaper for those that actually worked."
5,Good bargin and prompt delivery,"I was in desperate need of diapers for my child, and low and behold here is Amazon.com ready for a great bargin for the size and quantity I will be pleased with, I wasn't sure at first but the delivery was as indicated (right on time). Thank you, my baby's butt is happy (and so am I)."
1,Over a third of the diapers didn't have a tab on the side to secure the diaper,"I usually LOVE these diapers and they are always great, but thisfirst and last order I got through Amazon, almost a third of them didn't have a tab on one side of them to secure the diaper to my child. I had to throw out a lot of unused diapers and frankly that really sucked because diapers are expensive and I don't like wasting my money. I think I will steer clear of buying diapers from Amazon from now on."
5,Cheaper,Sometimes website is much cheaper than store so i start to search and found this one . It was good and much cheaper i save a little.
2,"leaky, corse, and loose","I usually use the ""Little Movers"" style for my daughter, but I thought I would try these to see if I could save a few bucks. Unfortunately, I didn't really like these diapers.Here are my issues:- Size for size - the Snug and Dry are a little larger than the Little Movers- Many more leaks w/ the Snug and Dry - hardly ever any leaks w/ Little Movers- Corse, hard, bulky and crunchy material as compared to Little MoversI will not buy these again - I'm going back to the Little Movers as soon as this case is used up!"
4,good for boys,"I preferred Pamper with my daughters, but will only use Huggies Snug and Dry with my son. They work so much better at preventing leaks."
5,huggies diapers step 1,"I've always liked and used Huggies for my three sons. I like them better than Pampers (personal taste), no matter the size."
3,Works well...but blue dye stains clothes,"I think the diapers work well keeping DD dry through the night, but they are hit and miss with the messes. Overall a decent diaper. What I don't like is that in the recent package we got, Huggies has started using some sort of blue dye in the lining of the diapers that actually stain clothing. I haven't been able to entirely remove the blue from her white onesies. Not a huge deal, but I prefer the all white diapers like they used to be."
2,Poor quality,"I purchased the diapers size 4 for my daughter. The quality is very poor. She doesn't even poop in them only occasional pees. And we do change her diapers very often. After a short wear, the inside will just tear apart and form different cotton knots. It is very disappointing!"
2,Leaking a lot,The material is comfortable but somehow it leaks a lot. We didn't have this problem with the other brand we also used.
1,don't fit,These diapers do not fit my daughter at all. They leak all the time. I much prefer the cheap brand from walmart.
2,Huggies diapers,Not a huge fan of Huggies everytime I have bought Huggies I'm changing my daughters clothes often because they leak. I get Huggies every so often cause of sales. I don't know if because of the design or what but the diaper basically turns into a diaper wedgie. It just doesn't seem to stay in place unlike pampers.
3,Good diapers,"I will give these diapers 3 stars,as they have good absorbency.But once your baby pees in them,they stink bad.U will have to bear that part.Apart from that they are good diapers for size 3."
5,ok diapers,"My son only wears diapers when he sleeps. There have been quite a few times that this diaper has leaked all over his pajamas. He used to wear the Costco brand of diapers which NEVER leaked. Since he only wears them when he sleeps, I am willing to make the sacrifice of a possible diaper leak for a much less expensive diaper."
2,Not the greatest anymore,"I've always used Pampers in the past for my girls and now with my son I am trying Huggies because of it's shape which I thought would be a better fit. But there still are leaks sometimes and now there's that dye problem others are complaining about. I've used Huggies for my son since nb size and this problem just started with their ""new"" diaper. All my son's clothing have the blue dye on it around the diaper area. I'm trying Pampers again."
2,Huggies,"I don't really like these diapers very much, I wish that the swaddlers came in bigger sizes. They do keep her dry I just want the other ones."
1,Amazon sent a box of opened/used? diapers,"Just to clarify at the beginning, I have never had major problems with Huggies diapers, this review is more about Amazon's service than the diapers. I received an unlabeled, small brown box addressed from the ""Amazon return center"" with a bunch of diapers haphazardly thrown in it. No original plastic bag, no Huggies original box... I cannot even be sure about the number of diapers I received... (I was not going to count them). I consider diapers personal hygiene items, like feminine pads, what would you say if you would get an opened box of those??? I am very upset and returning the box as it is. Will probably not use Amazon for my diaper orders in the future, although it used to be so convenient."
4,Huggies baby Dipers.,"I ordered Huggies Dipers 156 pack,, The delivery was quick and on time. This was cheap. The quality was a bit compromisable at tish price. If you baby is a hyper active baby, then baby will tear off the dipers quickly, otherwise good."
3,"Okay, but didn't turn me into a Huggies fan","I bought these because they were on sale and had an amazon coupon. Even though they are a 1-2 I really don't feel they are any larger than Pampers size 1....so I will probably end up donating most of them because my baby boy is growing so fast, but thats not Huggies fault! They are okay diapers...I prefer pampers swaddlers with dry max though. This is totally superficial...but I don't like the ""blue tint"" and mickey designs on these dipes either. However, they did come out ot be significantly less expensive than Pampers...and for that...they are a pretty good deal! Hope I get to use most of them!"
4,Good Product,"I thought this would be a box of sizes one and two, It is an in-between size. Bigger than a one smaller then a two. But I love Huggies they are the only diapers that do not leak and keep the poo from going up the Back!!"
1,it cant be bad than this,"They were really bad..poop leaked out many times and it got really messy.... it leaks from back-top and from sides.My baby is not a huge baby and specs says upto 14-15 lb, but side elastic leave marks on baby's leg even when he was 12lb."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"With my first son we stuck to Luvs brand diapers. It's what we'd received in the hospital and I never strayed from them. I was happy with their price and performance and never saw fit to venture on to other brands. With baby number two we received Huggies and I thought I would give them a try. I like the fact that they are roomy diapers, and the waist closures are very flexible. The diapers get good coverage, but don't hold much. I had to change my son every half hour, regardless of how much he'd gone- because the moisture would leak through the bottom of the diaper. We have since gone back to Luvs and haven't had that problem. Huggies might be good for newborns, but the bigger the size- the less they worked for us. We definitely suggest Luvs over Huggies. Save yourself the time AND the money."
1,MUST HAVE BEEN THE REJECTS FROM HUGGIES,"I HAVE BEEN A HUGGIES DIAPERS USER WITH BOTH OF MY CHILDREN, BUT NEVER HAVE I GOTTEN TWO ENTIRE BOXES OF CRAPPY DIAPERS. THERE IS ALWAYS THE OCCASIONAL DIAPER THAT HAS A MISSING OR TORN FASTENER TAB, OR MAYBE THE LEG ELASTIC IS STUCK TO THE INSIDE OF THE DIAPER, BUT I RECEIVED TWO ENTIRE BOXES OF THIS TYPE OF DIAPER. AFTER FIGHTING WITH THE FIRST BOX, (ONLY ABOUT HALF WERE EVEN USABLE) I STORED THE SECOND BOX IN THE CLOSET. WE TRIED TO CAREFULLY LIFT THE LEG LINER FROM THE DIAPER INSIDE LINER, BUT IT KEPT RIPPING AND SHREDDING THE DIAPER LINER, WHICH MADE THE DIAPER USELESS. WHEN THE TABS WERE MISSING, WE GAVE THEM TO OUR OLDER DAUGHTER TO PLAY WITH ON HER DOLLS.I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE SECOND BOX, BUT FOR NOW, IT IS JUST TAKING UP CLOSET SPACE."
1,Huggies Not What They Use To Be.,"5 years ago I used Huggies and Huggies Supremes for my oldest daughter. They worked like a charm and I never had a problem with them. I decided I would try Huggies again with my youngest. Huggies aren't like they use to be. The diapers leaked constantly both pee and poo. A leaky pee diaper....no problem, wipe baby down, change jammies, sheets, etc. Leaky poop diaper....not so easy to deal with, stained clothing, poo all over the place, headache and hassle, specially if you happen to be walking around say a public place like Wal-Mart or the Mall. Needless to say we aren't using Huggies anymore....Luvs seem to work just great....haven't had a leak at all."
1,Why change a good thing?,"I had the same problem with these diapers as I did with the overnight diapers. Huggies changed their packaging as well as their diapers, and I am highly disappointed in the change. The previous diapers had very little dye in them, and they were a better quality diaper. The new diapers have so much dye in them that they leave blue coloring on my son's white or light-colored clothes. My son had no problems with rashes with the other diapers, but he actually got a rash every other day that we used these diapers. We had bought these instead of Huggies Pure and Natural to save some money, but we had to go back to the Pure and Natural because these were so awful. Not so with the previous 'edition' of these diapers. They were thicker, held more, had very little dye, and very rarely leaked. These leaked more frequently. I would not recommend these, but I would buy them again if Huggies changed back to the other ones or made these better quality."
1,Horrible batch of diapers,"This was the first time I had ordered Huggies because of all of the positive reviews I had heard. This box, however, has been horrible. At least 2 out of 3 diapers I attempt to use are unusuable because they have holes in them. When a diaper is used with holes, it leaks everywhere. These have been the worst purchase of diapers I have ever had."
3,It's ok,"I was using pampers but tried huggies since they were cheaper(via subscribe option) and had decent reviews. They were good enough until I tried the target brand, Up and up. Amazingly enough, up and up was a better fit for my 2 months old and even cheaper still. In comparison, huggies felt really rough like newspaper and bunched up on her."
2,dye clothes,"I've used hauggies before with my older one, and don't remember having this problem.The diaper colors the clothes in blue/greenish color that doesn't come off!Also, it's quite a heavy diaper, and not so soft and flexible.From my experience with pampers sizes NB-2, they were much better."
4,Minor difference from item purchase at store,"Satisfied with the diapers purchase, the only difference I found out from same kind of diapers purchase at cosco was that these diapers do not have the tab on top of the diaper to fix the diaper better."
3,Did not fit my 14lb baby,The huggies were cute but they leaked out the sides on a fairly frequent basis (about once every other day) and were somewhat small on my 14lb 3month old girl. I've since switched to pampers size 2 and have been very pleased.
1,It will give your baby a rash...,I've had a major rash problem with sizes 3 and 4 from this huggies brand. Be aware... they will give your baby a horrible excoriating rash.
1,Huggies Stink!!,When I use huggies my poor son smells like urine as soon as he wets his diaper just a little. I am not rich and prefer not having to change a diaper every hour if not sooner. The smell is awful. Every morning I also had to deal with leaks. These are the worst diapers. I use pampers and love them. I have also used the target diapers and like them. Both choices are sooo much better then huggies. The only reason I ever use huggies is because that seems to be THE diaper for gift givers..lol I have a box in the closet now I will only use in emergencies.
1,The package was damaged,"I am waiting for the diapers package, and it is still not been sent to me. My son will have no diapers now. This is a bad thing"
5,Good for my two-year-old,"When I first used Huggies 1-2 size diapers for my little one when she was 2-3 months. I was so unsatisfied with the product (frequent leakage, very stiff when wet, gel particles and coarse surface...) that I switched to Pamper Swaddler, then Cruiser and didn't take an eye one Huggies product again. When she was turning to 2, her pants was very frequently wet in the morning even though I change her midnight with Cruiser. When I looked at the diaper isle, I talked to my husband why we didn't make a change. I bought Huggies Baby-Shaped Fit 4 for her from BJs, it turned out to be perfect (soft, very well fit, no wet pants, and no get). I won't go back to cruiser again even though there are good deals in the store. When I saw the good deal here, I order it without hesitation. The product from here is just same quality as what we got in BJs. However, I can save a lot at BJs when it in regular price."
3,$30 cert.,This message is for Michael. I had the same problem when I got these diapers a while back. I ended up by emailing customer service and they sent me the certificate code right away. I hope this helps.
2,these diapers are not a great fit,I didn't really like these diapers compared to others. I'm not sure what the difference really is but I feel that these diapers are not a great fit for my son. These diapers were given to us by a family friend who said they tried them on their daughter who is also 4 months old and they leaked on them.
3,Huggies not my favorite,"I worry about cost of baby products just like every other parent so when I received a coupon that would make the Huggies diapers the same prices as Luvs, I thought I would give it a shot. I will not be purchasing them again. They did their job, no pee pee leaks or poop explosions but the diaper was thick it was hard to feel if it was wet or dirty. LUVS does a great job, a little cheaper and you can feel if there is a little prize inside."
2,Worse than Huggies Little Movers,I previously used Pampers Swaddlers and Huggies Little Movers. But the only ones they had at Costco were Huggies Snug & Dry. I saw that the reviews for Snug & Dry on Amazon were decent and I figured they can't be too much different from Little Movers so I bought a giant pack. As it turns out that was a mistake. I don't know what the difference between these and Little Movers is but they simply don't last more than a few hours before starting to leak. That's fine most of the time during the day since they get replaced frequently but it's not acceptable for night time. And they don't handle larger bowel movements well either. Sorry to say that I'm very diappointed.
1,"Leaks, Leaks, and More LEAKS!","My son is 10 months old. We have been loyal Pamper Swaddler Diaper users since he was born. When the price of the Swaddlers went up, I decided to give Huggies a try since they got such great reviews. I also know that Costco sells them and I love Costco's products. After using Huggies for just a couple days, my son was wet at least 2-3 times a day. These diapers were horrible! I am not talking a small leak, his pants would become saturated. I was very disappointed. Changing a fussy baby is not fun! I will be going back to Pampers Swaddlers.....paying the extra $5-10 so my baby is happy and DRY!"
3,Meh,"These are serviceable as far as diapers go. They are a good price and shipping is quick an efficient. However, the little movers fit my daughter much better. These have a tendency to pull away around the legs."
4,Good... but possibly a sizing issue,"These diapers worked well while our baby was on the lower end of the weight range. Once he got over 20 pounds, he's been having issues with poos going up his back. He is kind of chunky, so he might simply be too wide and sized out of these earlier than expected.We're moving up to size 4."
5,CHEAPER AT Babys R Us!,YOU CAN GET A 246 COUNT BOX OF THESE SAME DIAPERS FOR $43.99 AT BABYS R US. I KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SHOPPING AROUND FOR THE BEST PRICES.
2,Product would bunch up,"I have twins, so we go through a lot of diapers. Huggies are known for quality, but this box of diapers were horrible. I have bought about 12-15 boxes of various sizes from Sam's club and they were of nice quality. The diapers would bunch up really bad and when I would change them, the diaper filling was all seperated. I was very disappointed with the quality of my online purchase."
5,size 4 diapers,"Holds everything in, as it should! If I am ever finding I have an issue with leaks I just have to move up a size and they work perfectly again."
3,"ok product,","not very fresh for my son's small put, has several redness issue after the use.I would try some better one for my son's sensitive skin."
3,We will have to go back to Pampers,"Not sure why, but all of our kids seem to do better in Pampers. These seem to leak more often - but we have no rational reason. Delivery and pricing with Subscribe and Save is great, but we will go with the same for Pampers."
5,Love Huggies!,"Such a great price for these! I was using a store brand, but these are just about the same price and such better quality!"
3,15lbs is pushing it,I use Huggies regularly and even though I was putting Katy in size 2 I thought the 1-2 would be fine since she was still only 13 lbs. I found they seemed a bit to small and were prone to leak more than using a size 2. Won't make that mistake again.
4,Better than Papmpers Baby-Dry,We have used this one for months and like it. It hugs the thighs comfortably and no leaking like the Papmpers Baby-Dry.
4,good,good price....after 30% off it is cheaper than costco or same club and even ship it to home for free
2,Stinks,"These were not bad diapers in that they didn't leak, but whenever my daughter urinated the tiniest bit they stank like pee. Obviously I can't be changing her diaper every 20 minutes, so these diapers were a no-go. Pampers have much better odor control."
4,great product,"I recently swithced from pampers to huggies do to a series of leaky diapers. This brand of huggies work very well for my daughter who just turned one and is 18 lbs. She is a climber and constantly moving. The diapers fit her very well, have good absorbancy, and are mostly white so they do not show through her outfits!"
3,"Ok, but Luvs are better","I bought these for my little one and for newborns they are great but as your munchkin grow they will most likely also outgrow being able to use huggies as well. Atleast mine did. As soon as we moved her up a size, they started leaking (and not because they didnt' fit or where too big). They just didn't want to hold much of anything. I had also not had any blow out issues until we had her in these. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. So as far as for newborns, they're great but the second they start to move at all, I'd switch to luvs. They are much better easier on the pocket book too."
2,Diaper dye goes off on my son,i loved huggies since day one that is all ive used. i had and still has great protection given the fact that he urinates alot. however a couple of months ago i noticed they changed the design on the diaper and all of a sudden my 10 month's old son upper thighs started turning blue all the time and it doesnt come off even after a bath!!!! its ridiculous! so i concluded the diaper dye of the design goes on his thighs. so i have unfortunately change the brand for that reason
3,differnt than normal,"these diapers were different than normal...not sure why. they stick together way more than usual and have a rougher texture, like they are of poorer quality."
2,"OK as far as protection, but ink comes off on clothes!","I decided to try and save a few bucks and switch to these diapers from my normal Earths Best. I was quite taken back when I saw the ink allover my sons onesies and shirts after only wearing a diaper for an hour or two. My son is 11 months and wears a size 4 (kind of big on him, but I found bigger is generally a safer bet anyhow). I do diaper changes any time I notice it's dirty or just kind of wet and hasn't been changed in a bit - basically, what I'm saying is it's not like the kid was sitting in a super wet diaper for hours - yet the ink still leaked allover everything. I didn't really have any issues with leaking or blowouts, so that was a plus, but the fact that the ink leaks is reason enough for me to run back to my chlorine free, gentle Earths Best diapers in an instant! I recommend spending the few extra bucks if you can and go with a better brand."
3,Ok... but have flaws,"I just started using the Huggies Snug N Dry and I'm not a huge fan. My twin boys have just moved up to size 3, so I switched from the Little Snugglers--which I really liked--to these.The two main issues I have are:(1) The blue liner is leaving blue marks on my boy's legs. One twin has this problem, the other doesn't, so it must be something with his skin chemistry. He does have more sensitive skin than his brother.(2) Not a great fit around the legs. I've been having leak issues (both urine and poo) around the legs. This doesn't just happen when the diapers are really full--they get change frequently. The ""seal"" around the leg just isn't that tight. The boys are at the bottom end of the size 3 weight range (17 lbs), so maybe as they grow they'll fit better. But, due to issue #1 I not going to test this."
5,Been with Huggies since Size 2,"We moved from Pampers to Huggies when my daughter was in size 2 diapers. That was the time when all the new Pampers came out, the ones with the new stay dry chemicals were put in. We were put off by that and have been happy with Huggies ever since."
5,Best diaper best price,Huggies diapers fit my kids the best with only rare leaks. Amazon has the best prices too with subscribe and save and Amazon Mom (even over what coupons and deal searching in regular stores can usually get you).
1,I think they changed how they make them,"I have a 14 year old, an 11 year old and a 2 year old. I have ALWAYS used Huggies diapers, hands down the best....UNTIL my last two shipments. I had trouble with the entire case. The closures didnt stick and kept coming loose, every diaper sagged and leaked,(and I ALWAYS change my son every few hours because he drinks alot in this southrn heat) I even tryed a bigger size, figuring maybe even thugh he fits in the 3, his bladder may just hold too much for a 3 but no change with the 4s either. I have also had the same problem with the Huggies overnights. I was so unhappy with this recent purchase that I switched to the Fisher Price brand diapers, which are ALOT cheaper, come with 2 bags day and 1 bag overnight diapers and I have had no problems with closures, sagging or leakage from any of them. Consider me an EX-customer. Whatever you changed, Huggies, please change it back or I think you will continue to lose customers."
2,Huggies Size 3,"The material of the actual diaper is hard to touch and it falls off easily, there is not enough grip."
2,Not very happy with the Huggies diapers - Subscribe & Save,"This is the second time that I have received the 156 count Huggies Size 3 diapers for my child. The box was a bit torn and crushed on one end. It seems that the manufactured date for the diapers is way in the past since I can see a notable difference in quality between the stuff I received the first time and the second time. The absorbent material seems to come out and stick to my child's skin after just a couple of hours of use. The diapers are all sticky and not so easy to unwrap.In short, I am disappointed."
1,not worth it,These leak a lot and the plastic irritates my babies skin and they smell like chemicles.
4,Never look back,I'm been using Huggies ever since my first born and with my second kid I stick to the same. It works as long as the child is not too close to the weight limit. If they are they might pee through it which is a sign to change to a bigger one. The only problem I have is that the newer Huggies have a scent which make it hard for me to tell if my daughter pee or not.
5,snug & dry vs. little movers and Pampers,"After trying all diaper brands even generic and cloth, Huggies snug & dry are by far the most superior on the market. Pampers and luvs are made by the same manufacturer and that god awful deoderant is so bad. I was taught as a teenager not to use scented products on my private areas yet we are putting them on our tiny little ones? Dont even get me started on scented wipes. Little movers are designed for babies with chunkier legs I think and my girls legs are more slender so she needs the extra padding on her upper thigh. Hope this helped!Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers, Size 4, 140-Count"
5,We've tried them all,"Since my baby was born eight months ago, I've switched from Pampers to Luvs and back again thinking Huggies were a little too expensive. Recently I did another price comparison and for the number of diapers I receive in the Huggies Snug & Dry package, the price is actually cheaper than the Pampers (especially with Amazon Mom). We've been using Huggies for two months now and haven't had a single leak, whereas with both the Pampers and Luvs we had leaks at least once or twice a week. I will keep buying the Huggies!"
1,moisture beads all over,I like the fit of these diapers over pampers bc they have a higher leg cut and cinch in the back but on more than one occasion the clear beads that absorb the moisture were all over my little guy when I changed his diapers.Back to pampers for us. . . that has never happened with his pampers
1,Different (and WORSE) than the Snug and Dry I came to know and love,"I've tried about half a dozen dif't diapers in the last 6 months, and this was my favorite (until I tried Nature's babycare recently) until I received this new box and the diapers are completely different. The previous diapers were a nice, well-padded, white interior (so presumably some kind of fiber). These are much thinner and filled with a blue gel substance. NOT A FAN! They are still absorbent and did not result in any leaks in the few I tried, but I am not comfortable using a chemical based gel on my baby. Will not be using anymore!"
3,Ok diapers but not my favorite,"This diaper did not meet my expectations. The only way that this diaper is ok for us to use effectively is during the day when our baby is awake and gets changed every one to two hours. For overnight use this diaper does not keep my baby dry and comfortable. Also this diaper only worked for my baby if she was directly on her back or belly(supervised) because on her side the pee went directly between the diaper and her legs and onto her clothes. The smell of the urine also pertrudes through the diaper and when she has wet the diaper even once, the smell is very strong. I would not recommend this product for overnight wear."
1,Substantial reduction in quality,"These diapers from amazon are total junk. We are not sure what they have done. The reduction is quality is clearly to increase margins. They have no elasticity, they have reduced absorbtion and just overall feel cheap. Dont buy from amazon. Get them from your local store."
1,Subscribe and Save Rip Off,The Diapers are fine but Amazon is using subscribe and save to rip you off. A month to month bump in price of $5 for these diapers is ridiculous and not reflected in the marketplace at large. Bad business.
2,Many defective diapers,"There were so many defective diapers inside the pack. Most of them had gotten stuck by glue, making it non usable. I had to throw away many since the glue mark on the inside of the diaper was hard enough to cause my baby blisters. I have been using huggies since my baby was born, never had such a problem!"
5,Great value,"These are great diapers. Huggies beats the rest... better than any other brand! And if you sign up for Amazon Mom and use the subscribe and save option, you can't beat the price ANYWHERE!"
1,defective,"this product was poorly made, my daughters legs were turning blue from the dye in the diaper. It would wash off after scrubbing with soap and water. it also caused her to get a diaper rash so bad we had to make a trip to the Dr. who immediately prescribed medicine for her. This product is NOT made for babies that are sensitive to rough materials."
5,diapering children for25+ years,"Huggies snug and dry diapers are the best diapers out there. I have been diapering children for over 25 years. Nanny, Mom of 3 (in their 20's now), Grandmother of 1 and Day Care Provider for 17 years. Another popular brand ""dry max"" claiming to keep babies dry thru the night didn't last two hours. At the time my Granddaughter was only drinking a 6 ounce bottle. Those diapers cost about $15 more on average a case then these. Also, Amazon has had the best price on these for about 5 months now. We have tried several brands so I'm making a fair comparison. These are a size 4 because we thought she needed the next size. In other brands she would need a 4. But, Huggies she could still wear a 3."
3,what happened?!?,"I used to love these diapers, but recently the diapers have had a weird blue dye on them. Also the tabs break easily when trying to unfold them. Lastly the prices seem to go up almost monthly. I hope that huggies fixes these problems."
2,Hey! Why did the price go up for subscription without notice?,Just noticed the price went up $6 on this subsribe & save since 2 weeks ago. Not much more than the instore value at this point. Some notice would have been nice.
3,leak,I like these diapers but they seem to not be high enough and leak around the legs. My son is 12.4 and has alot of blow outs with these.
1,leak!leak!leak!,Not the previous one! I must change the diaper in the midnight. If I do not change the diaper it will leak and make Baby One Piece Sleeper wet. So terrible!
1,"If zero stars was available, I would do it","So our 8 month started using these diapers. We figured why not as we had two huge boxes from some nice family members. I have not seen my baby girl in more pain than after the extreme epic rash she gets from these diapers. Happened at night. Baby wouldn't sleep, and would go into hysteria every 10 min. We thought it was her teeth. Fast forward to daylight, we are changing her diaper, and see a craze swollen rash on her bottom. Baby is also scratching herself in the spot, she know it hurts there. Switched diapers, baby fell asleep within 10 mins."
5,This is a blast!,"This was one of the funniest games of all...It is even better if you don't know the people to well as you will be able to guess their personalities...and so on...And the ones who think they know you don't know you AT ALL,,,,,,,,,"
1,Skip it!,"We recently started having Game Night at our house with our friends and borrowed The Game of Things and LOVED IT!!! So I wanted to try something different and did a little research and found Imaginiff....bought it and was excited to play with 8 adults who knew each other fairly well. Let's just say...it'll probably go on the bookshelf and not come back out again! If I could return it, I would. Compared to The Game of Things, it was dull and boring. The questions were often lame or didn't make any sense at all. We wanted to have a 7th ""fill in the blank"" choice to try to make it more interesting. I felt that the game really brought the vibe of the party down and I definitely will not play it again.Anyone want to trade a Brand New, Just Played Once Imaginiff for The Game of Things? I'd like to have my own copy."
5,Great Game,"I bought this game in Target because we were having a fourth of july party. The label on the box said ""Over 1 million sold. Numerous gaming awards won"". So I bought it hoping it would be fun. This game was a hit. People were crying cause they were laughing so hard. I truely recommend this game. We played with five people and we had a ball. I can't wait to play this game again!"
5,iMAgiNiff - Find out what your friends think of you,I played iMAgiNiff last night for the first time. It was a blast. It is a great way for friends to find out what they think of each other. Many of the questions sparked lively discussions.We had less than 8 people playing so we filled in some famous people in the extra spots. That added a cool twist to the game.I can't wait to play with my family. But I don't think I am ready to play with the in-laws.
5,Imagin Iff... is the best family therapy game ever.,"This was the best therapy game ever. My girls bought it for me, a gift because I love board games. We mostly played it with their friends. I have played with my children several times and found out some very interesting views that they have about me. I decided to bring it to a family gathering. I have always been distant with my eight siblings. The game started out with the kids and my sisters ect. then when they saw I was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to leave and just the sisters played. We had a total awakening of how we see each other. We have never been closer, since that game our communication has been wonderful. This game is the best. We laughed so hard we ached the next day. We played till 2:00 a.m. Our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home. We started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we'd just be an hour or two. LOL I have been instructed to bring the game to this Summers get-together."
5,Great Game for Adults!,I love this game. We play with friends over a few drinks. You do need to play with people you are familiar with though. We always bring this on vacation with us. Very easy to pick up and explain to people who have never played before.
5,Imaginiff,"It is a fun game. Have played it before. Nice to game to play with a family from kids to grandparents. Fun. Came quick, too."
3,Not for 2 players,"I was looking for games that 2 people could play. The site states that it is for 2 to 8 players. It is not. When I got the game and started reading the instructions it became clear that you need at least 3 players. Then I looked on the box and it clearly states ""for 3 to 8 players"". I don't know how to rate it because we did not get to play it."
3,You need competition in a game,"I don't think the noncompetitive angle of Imaginiff works. People are naturally competitive, and that's what makes playing fun. For fun not-too-competitive get-to-know you party games, I recommend Rigamarole and, if there are younger kids, Cranium."
5,Love this game!,This game is a lot of fun. You really get to know how other people perceive you in funny quirky ways and how you perceive them. What a blast!
5,Awesome game if everyone has the same circle of friends,"There is no better party board game out there if you are playing with a group of 4-8 people and you all happen to have the same circle of friends. This last point is key because you're asked to answer questions about 8 different people. If not everybody playing knows all 8 people the game tends to be much less fun. Some of the questions are a little hokey and more often than not you'll wish that you could add in your own response since the pre-printed options don't always get the job done, but all in all this is a very fun game. The directions are easy to follow and start to finish each game only lasts about 30-45 minutes."
4,For a gift,"This game came recommended, so I bought it for a gift. Haven't played it. Will play it when the person opens their Christmas gift!"
5,"Great service, great product","Product was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition. This game is so much fun, especially if you are a relational person."
3,"Looks good, medium quality construction","The frame itself is of solid construction while the silver screw covers are plastic. This is fine. My car had larger screws on before so we had to substitute those for the back plate and couldn't cover the screws, but they worked great on the front even without a backing. I bought an additional pack of screw covers and we used the plastic bits as washers.The biggest downside of this plate is that it is too small and covers the stickers. They're still readable, and hopefully still legal, but there should be dips on both sides of the plate for the stickers.The thing to keep in mind is a lot of cars only screw in on the top of the license plate. I ended up supergluing the screw covers to the bottom holes on the plate to make it look nice."
3,Don't Expect Screw Covers to Stay On,"The screw covers are very loose and I was only able to make only three of them stick on each plat (back and front). I believe the remaining ones will fall very soon. Since all four holes are not properly aligned with the license plates' holes, I couldn't even put one of them on. I think that one reviewer mentioned that ""they don't come with a replacment"", I don't believe that even if they came with replacement covers, it would work as you cannot make some of them stick."
2,NOT GOOD AT ALL.,"I got this mouse from Bestbuy and I had to return it. it's not very comforable, and the moment of this mouse is not good at all, I have a old mouse doesn't work too well, so I try to get a new mouse, but this one is about the same with the old one, the old mouse is 10 months old and I bought it like $10, this one I just got it 10 months after at the price is $30, and they are about the same, just a waste of money!"
2,"Good mouse, but buttons are pretty bad","I picked up one after my old Logitech mouse cord went bad. One thing I noticed off the bat (which might not be a common technical problem) was that the left and right buttons were not good. Clicking on something sometimes wouldn't work. The mouse button would ""click"" but onscreen it wouldn't register unless you actually pushed the button hard. Was very annoying and I quickly returned the mouse after testing it for a day or 2. Is a narrow mouse also, I don't recommend it for people with large hands, it just doesn't feel smooth and natural. Get a wider one."
2,Smooth but awkward,"I was immediately disappointed when I began to use the mouse. It is certainly stylish, well-crafted and engineered. But the click was loud, heavy, and sluggish - possibly owing to the fact that the left and right buttons are made of one continuous sheet of plastic, bent and split in the middle so as to provide separate contacts around the wheel. What's more, the height of the click panels is more than I was accustomed to. I began to develop a small ache after several minutes.All of this may be a simple matter of personal preference. But subtle and quiet this mouse is not. The included software is helpful if you want to customize which function goes where - I did not. A nifty ps/2 - usb adapter was an added bonus."
3,Delicious,"The items are tasty, unfortunately I developed hives and intense itching after ingestion. Never had allergic reaction to this type of food before but there's always a first. After initial hive breakout I stopped eating the pastries and gave it a few days to see if it could be from other things. The hives went away after a about five days and returned as soon as I ate the first piece after a week [they were refrigerated]."
5,wonderful as usual,"I used to visit the bakery when I lived closer to Dearborn, And I have always loved their food. I order the assorted pastries about every 6 months as a treat and they are wonderful."
4,Another great one!,"A very experimental work of art from Kevin Braheny, once again tapping into the hearts of his listeners. May Peace Prevail is one of my soul songs."
2,This book has too many omissions.,"A hastily-updated version of an older book originally published in Britain, it lacks guides for dozens of shows such as Beyond Reality, Tales from the Darkside, Goosebumps, Friday the 13th, Probe, Starman, Misfits of Science, etc. Even when shows are covered, they often consist only of a list of episode titles, e.g. Tekwar, Forever Knight, Captain Power, Wild Wild West, VR.5, Are You Afraid of the Dark, Hercules and Xena. Sometimes the listing is woefully incomplete: the book covers only 10 of the 65 episodes of Ray Bradbury Theater and only 13 of the 96 episodes of One Step Beyond. And you can forget it if you're looking for episode info on old shows such as Space Patrol, Rocky Jones Space Ranger, Flash Gordon, World of Giants, Commando Cody, or Way Out. Even some shows currently running on the Sci-Fi Channel, such as Boris Karloff's Thriller, are not covered. If you're willing to spend a little more, get Alan Morton's ""Complete Directory"" instead."
1,Junk,"Wow! I guess I should feel lucky. My MVR650 didn't start eating tapes until months after I bought it. Well, not eating them outright, anyway. It *always* chewed on them a bit. From the beginning fast forwarding would scrape the oxide off the tape (that section would never be watchable again) but it didn't actually start refusing to release the tape for several months. Shutting itself off as soon as you inserted a tape didn't start for months either along with ejecting that cassette once you turned it back on. Oh, but I said it wouldn't release the tape, didn't I? Well it would eject the *cassette*, but that doesn't mean it would release the *tape*.I lived with this piece of junk so long because it is hard to find a VCR these days narrow enough to fit on my shelf. Everyone seems to have gone to those 17 inch behemoths."
1,If it's anything like the 450 model stay away . . .,If it's anything like the 450 model stay away. I bought a 450 and it started to eat tapes 1 week after the warranty expired. Nothing else to add. Another piece of electronic junk for the trash that doesn't give you your money's worth of service.I really have to start reading these reviews BEFORE I buy.
2,You get what you pay for,This is cheap junk. Of course I paid a junk price (39.00). The main problem is it started eating my tapes. Also only one speed works properly.
2,Magnavox VCR. Not Too Great!,"All-Right, this VCR is in simple terms, A PIECE OF TRASH. I bought this and as usual everything says it's great, it's not! Whatever happened to Magnavox products, the company is slam-bang, but until I got this VCR, I thought that something got totally messed up; I think Magnavox should get themselves back on their feet, because I think they're a great company, but this VCR isn't worth paying for and trying to play!"
5,I love it,"This robe is just what I wanted. It is thick and soft and oh so cozy. The length is good, for me between ankle and calf. I'm pretty short. There is a lot of material through the middle. It is definitely not form-fitting or terribly sexy, but I think it's awesome. Since I got it, I seem to be in it whenever I'm home."
2,Too much,Too heavy. The fabric is soft but garment feels heavy and constricting. It would just be too much when worn with a nightgown underneath.
5,Totally awesome robe!,"Can't believe something so lightweight can be so warm! It's plenty long, soft, and cozy. There is minimal lint, even on the first washing. It's comparable to many high end robes that cost a lot more."
2,Too warm and bulky,"I was looking for a light, warm, and - most important - full-length robe. This one is full-length, but it's just too hot and too bulky-looking. Not very flattering."
4,OK after a wash,"Bought this for my wife at Christmas. Yes it is cozy and warm, but out of the box it had a ""stale"" odor. One cycle thru the washer and dryer solved the problem. She now wears it daily."
2,disappointed,"I found a bathrobe for 15.00 dollars that was nicer just a little less warmer.I had bought this one prior to the microfiber one I bought through you,even paid extra to get it here sooner.The collar on the robe,it's just... weird.My wife washed this one before she knew I had the other one so was unable to return and for 15.00 dollars and nicer robe we kept that one.I was expecting a higher quality product for the price."
3,fleece robe,"Robe is not as soft and fluffy as hoped. It has a more course rough look to it. However, it serves its purpose on a cold morning."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"This is an excellent robe.It is soft. warm and very durable. I am really happy with it, it has lived up to all my expectations."
2,not the material I wanted,"It won't help you get dry, it's more of a robe to hang out. I had to return it and the seller was really nice and gave me a refund."
1,dont spend this much,"please DO NOT spend this much for one of these robes.i gave 1 star only because of the price. if it had a hood i'd prolly rate it higher. walmart has a version of the same robe for under $20 also available in pink. don't know if it is the exact same. i purchased a black one last winter that i expect to last @ least 2 more winters, in fact i may get the pink one this winter just to have a change up. in combination with a pair of matching bootie slippers i feel totally pampered w/o paying a ridiculous price.not as plush as the two short hooded robes i bought @ target the year before but still very nice."
5,Like being back in the womb,"I am so satisfied with this product. After reviewing similar products, I eventually chose the Plush robe based on price and customer reviews. It was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not a robe guy but after wearing this one I can't go a day without it...I even take it with me when I travel! It's very warm and cozy; just wraps you in comfort. If you're looking for something to keep you warm in the winter, this is the robe for you!!"
2,Not as soft as you may think,"This hardly represents the ""microfiber"" feeling you may be familiar with. This felt more like a knotted up cotton bath towel than a soft bathrobe."
1,Not worth it!,"Wow! Maybe I'm behind the times, but this robe sure doesn't look like it's worth the money. Will be returning as soon as possible."
1,biggest regret ever,"I was excited about receiving a plush microfiber robe that's soft, warm and lightweight like it's advertised to be. Instead, I received what seems to be a used, ragged robe that has lots of pills. It is also very heavy and oversized. I normally would just return it, but they DID NOT send the return sheet in the box, NOR do they have the sender's info ON the box. If you are looking for a quality product DO NOT buy this."
1,What a Ripoff,"I wanted a nice robe to wear in the hospital when my son was born, and this robe had such glowing reviews, I had to buy it. Big mistake! I was greatly disappointed.I will say that this robe did have some things going for it: It IS soft, and comes in many colors.But, it is still WAY overpriced. And after only one washing on GENTLE cycle, the robe looks really ratty. Also, I was dumb enough to buy the matching slippers. There is practically no cushion to the soles at all, they are really cheaply made, and definitely not worth the $$$ I paid for them."
3,Haven't used blade yet,"The listing said it was for a pack of ten, but only one blade was delivered. The company noted it as a misprint and refunded my money voluntarily. The price did seem to good to be true, but no harm done in the end."
1,Not good,The darn grilled did not fit like they said it would. Had to cut it in several places to make it fit somewhat and the edges where sharp and it scrathed my bumber. Decided to keep it than to go go through the hazzle of sending it back. I will never buy from PUTCO ever again
3,Boggles the mind,"This CD had a couple of good songs and is from the 90's. I bought it because I'm a big fan of the Florida Freestyle scene especially if it has anything to do with Tolga Katas and Gary Tutalo who made mixed and produced music at the time. Tolga of course mixing/producing songs for Stevie B and Linear of course. I thought I might find some good songs especially for the cheap price I got this for and I was not disappointed. Most of the songs were not to my taste though, but I was not expecting much to begin with."
3,Nice sheets but not 5 stars,I purchased these sheets because Consumers Reports rated them very highly. These are not the same as a $400 set of high grade luxury hotel type sheets. The material is thin and soft but lacks that luxurious feel one would like to have in a set of sheets. Still good value for the money.
2,"Fit fine, but very poor and uncomfortable material","I bought these sheets last year, after a long search to find sheets that would fit my 20"" deep mattress. Good news is that they fit perfectly, better than any other sheet I've tried. Downside is the material they used is HORRIBLE. After a couple washes and a few weeks of use, the material began to pile and get very scratchy and uncomfortable. Stopped using them because it got bad enough that I was no longer able to sleep."
5,Best sheets for thick mattresses,I have a very thick sterns and foster mattress and these are the first sheets I have tried that fit the mattress without pulling up EVER. They are extremely soft and very reasonably priced.I would buy these again in a heart beat.LOVE THEM.
1,Far From Perfect,"Sorry to say, these Sealy Best Fit sheets were a bust on all counts. The capture-top pillowcases are a failure--fabric is not generous enough to make the design work and the bottom sheet does not fit squarely. Additionally, the type of cotton used for these sheets could be sold as a lint magnet. Unlike any other sheets I have ever owned, they come out of the dryer looking like they need to be vacuummed and forget about hanging them on the line; you would just have to put them back in the wash. After reading all the positive reviews, I thought I could not go wrong, but this is one sheet set I am eager to see wear out. They are totally disappointing."
5,Absolutely the best sheets you will ever sleep on!,"My husband and I both thought we were the best at choosing sheets. I bought the most expensive Egyptian cotten & highest thread count. My husband told me about Sealy sheets, he said they were by far the best fitting and softest sheets on the market. I hate to admit it, but he was right. We have a set that is 3 years old and still feels like they are brand new."
2,BAD quality product - BAD customer service,Pilling everywhere after washing the second time. I am very dissappointed with the feel and texture on my skin. After almost a year waiting Sealy customer service has not responded to my feedback regarding the poor quality of this product. Since this is the only product available for Sealy's extra deep mattresses ... Sealy has left one more customer behind.
2,"Fits well, but ""pilling"" is uncomfortable!","After about a week of sleeping on these sheets they started to get little ""pilling"" bumps all over the area we had slept. It keeps on getting worse, and now they're almost uncomfortable to sleep on... they feel like there are little grains of sand all over the bed and it's driving me nuts. This shouldn't happen with such expensive sheets!"
3,Sealy Best Fit 300,"Fit is wonderful, just as indicated, however, product arrived with a black marker-type stain just inside edge of pillowcase which didn't come out with first wash--also the sheets are pilly and no longer sateen after the very first wash. Too much trouble to return so will keep, but next time will be sure to purchase ONLY percale no matter what the thread count is."
1,"Fits well, feels terrible","I had high hopes when I ordered the Sealy Best Fit 300 Thread Count Cotton Sateen sheets. My husband and I like the feel of 100% cotton, and were looking forward to finding a set that would fit our bed nicely. The fit of the sheets is great. Wraps around the whole mattress without coming off on the corners. The sheets felt wonderful in the package, but after the first wash, they were horrible! I even used fabric softener and it made no difference. It felt like they were a polyester blend, very scratchy. We decided to keep the sheets in our closet for 'emergencies' only and found some wonderful sheets at Target instead. They are the new bamboo sheets - very soft, wonderful fit (even better than the Sealy), and wash very well. Sealy has it right....they do have a good fit. Too bad they don't have the 'best feel'."
5,Fine cotton sheets by Sealy,"Consumer Reports had rated these sheets as the top-rated in their survey of sheets. They have been very satisfactory so far. They fit the mattress well, and don't slip off as many others do."
4,Quality bedding from Sealy,"Bought as replacement bedding for well worn sheets. Found the fit,finish and comfort to be first rate. This bedding fits better thanand we've owned in 38 yrs. of marriage. Highly recommended."
1,Mysteriously poor,"I bought two sets of Sealy 300-count sateen Queen-size sheets, apparently the same except for color. One set is sateen, smooth, laundered well, and fits well. The other set ""pilled"" on the first washing and is not comfortable to sleep on. Consumer Reports rated these sheets at the top of the scale, but apparently the white sheets aren't made of the same fabric as the ""chamomile"" ones. It's a mystery."
1,Wrong Item sent three times,"I wish I could say something about the quality of this product, but I have received three sets of pillowcases and not the sheet set. There must be a mixup in the warehouse, but beware of ordering these sheets, because you will receive some expensive pillowcases. Amazon.com is always good about making it right (and they did), but it is a lot of trouble packaging up and returning."
2,I was in this film,"Yikes, it had the makings of being a funny T n' A / cult type movie but near the end the cheesy ""games"" were just too cheesy. It almost was a cool commentary on cheesy movies but lost that vision, if ever it had that vision. All I could do was be my best in my part. That and convince my movie girlfriend that we should make out (a lot!) before the cameras roll. Since we were supposed to be dating for awhile, our first kiss should not be on camera. I asked that our scene not involve nudity. There was plenty of that with the other performers anyway. More fun making than watching. But so is life!"
4,Wild Malibu Weekend,"Light comedy and humor of the Playboy generation. The story of several girls trying to get ahead in the entertainment business and their adventures along the way. The plot is light and entertaining with no real message other then trying to win the money and contract that the show has to offer.I liked the movie because it required no thinking or trying to figure what was coming up next. The girls were usual ""B"" movie types however I had seen most of them in other movies and this movie was closer to the start of their career so you do not have some of the bad body augmentation they have in more recent films which I liked. In my opinion the movie was one could could watch on a night when you just wanted to relax and not think but just wanted a laugh or two."
2,The low water mark of a once great show.,"Its the economy right? Right!Season 1 was great, Season 2 started to slide, Season 3 is a total disaster. None of the charm, humor,or wit exists here. What we have is Jeff basically losing his mind and alienating everybody around him,except for Zoila who is either just a rock, or is totally oblivious. Even Jenni who is just a livingdoll is walking around with this look of ..... fear on her face all the time. Yes its disquieting, yesits cringe worthy, no its not interesting, and it is absolutely not entertaining.I watched the entire season on DVD while they paraded through new character after new character that justdoesn't fit, and they are all mystified and terrified by Jeff who has by now just become a raving lunatic.Some extra behind the scenes features but honestly who cares. I hope these guys get their act togetherfor Season 4, but I'm not likely to invest in this series again."

3,Decent Little Teakettle,"I purchased a blue Camden teakettle, with no obvious defects. I've used it several times and I haven't noticed any paint chipping off or scratched places. It is a small tea kettle, but for the price it will work."
4,Good kettle,Just bought this kettle in red color at a local Tags hardware store. Does not look or feel flimsy. It is perfect for my needs. I need it to boil enough water for tea for two and it does that efficiently. The whistle works fine so far. I have no complaints and I'm happy with my purchase. Four stars because I think its too early to give it more than that.
1,Yellow Teakettle,"The same thing happened to me as happened to Diane Cody of Texas, only mine was an orangish yellow Garfield Teakettle, which had a huge black bare spot where paint was totally missing by base of the handle. Although it was darling, I, like Diane, didn't risk having it replaced after sending it back; shipping costs and inconvenience not worth it! So what's with the Yellow Teakettles I wonder?!Sincerely,Nan R."
1,Copco Yellow Teakettle,I ordered a Copco Yellow Teakettle. It came to me with a large portion of the yellow 'scrapped' off; there was just this big black 'hole' in the bottom portion of the teakettle. I had to ship it back - AND I HAD TO PAY POSTAGE TO SHIP IT BACK!! It was damaged when it came to me. It was a darling teakettle but I've already spent money on shipping twice now - and I still don't have a yellow teakettle. So I'm not ordering it again.DIANE CODY
1,Not worth the cost,"This video is not for someone who wants to pick up a few steps for social dancing. It seems to be directed at those who might want to get into competition. It is slow paced and does not include enough steps -- it is as if it were a trailer to get you to buy the next dvd.My wife and I are experienced dancers, so may be judging this too harshly. For us, it was a waste of money. We can learn more by pestering other dancers for hints. Again, we want only to do social dancing, not exhibition dancing."
3,Good for the price,"My partner is a poker fanatic and wanted a sort of ""starter set"". Having no clue about poker I couldn't possibly give a full review. The carousel was of much better quality than we had expected it is of substantial weight, and in a deep cherry finish. The quality of the chips and cards were okay according to the poker player :) overall I would say a worth it starter set."
4,Easy to put together,This was an easy unit to assemble. Just a Phillips screwdriver and a pair of pliers. The instructions were on the box. This took about ten minutes to do. I took it outside and tried it on the roof. We live in a single story ranch and the 16 foot unit reaches it with room to spare. I am waiting for it to snow to test it but it looks like it will work easily.
5,Great Tool,"Bought this after using my neighbors last winter, which worked great. So far, no snow, but it is ready to go. Went together well, and is well made. We know from experience that it works, so (not) looking forward to it."
3,"Seller great, product defective","The Garelick 89416 roof rake arrived safely. Assembly instructions were good. During assembly I discovered that one of the two support brackets was stamped wrong, deformed and bent. Really bad QC. Since I have a shop workbench vice, I was able to twist and re-bend the bracket to fit the mounting hole configuration, so I did not go through the return process.Other than that, I expect it will work well. I am still waiting for the first snowfall this year to test it."
1,Are negative reviews removed??,"I posted a lengthy review which was negative - nothing offensive about what I said but it is not here. Why?My concerns rest with the lack of customer service, the lack of interest in keeping a customer informed and lastly, providing initially misleading shipping information leading me to expect an earlier delivery of this item.So, I admit to being behind the 8 ball in trying to get one of these late in the game but, hey, the site said nothing about backorder or lack of stock so I ordered it. Then the stonewalling began. No details, no I am sorry but we are out. Nope, it isn't until I take the time to say -- hey, this should have shipped by now, then I get the answer --- we are out.Baloney!!!I am not happy and will not do business with these people again. And if Amazon wants to filter this review, I can avoid doing business with them, too. I do a lot of business here on this site but I can always find someone else who cares."
3,Needs to be clearer and cleaner,I was disappointed that there were not even minimal instructions for assembly -- just a bunch of parts. I also was not pleased that some of those parts had grease on them.
4,a roof rake is a roof rake,"It works just fine. I hadn't expected to get a workout in my shoulders like I do when I use it, but it's certainly capable of pulling snow off the edge of the roof. Assembly only took a few minutes using the instructions printed on the box it came shipped in. Nothing spectacular, but it works just fine."
2,NO ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS,"The rake was delivered 2 weeks after the original deliverery date. I tried to put it together without any instructions included, but the rollers are a real puzzle.The blade screw holes also seem to be on an angle. Is it supposed to be that way??The poles were advertised to have a snap lock button to secure each to the other, but they did not have such buttons or intelocking holes. Did I get an older version??"
3,they sent me the wrong snow rake,"I had wanted the Garelick snow rake butr was shipped a Suncast one. This did occurr during the crazy end of Jan when it was impossible to find a snow rake due to all the snow we had in New England.By the time I got it was too late to use it since I already had 3 feet of snow and ice on my roof but a friend who has a Garelick, has already broken his so I'll see how Suncast works out next year"
2,Piece of junk,"This is a piece of junk. I got this two weeks ago and never bothered to open the package and put it together. When I did need to use it I realised that instead of 3 straight rods and 1 curved one they decided to send me 4 straight rods. As a result I had to use the fourth straight rod and drill the necessary holes to use it where the curved rod would have gone leaving me with a completely straight shovel. Made in USA, but very poor quality control."
3,"Terrible Sound, Awkward Donning","I really wanted to love this headset. I really did. It is a bit difficult to don, but once in place, if you use the lapel clip, it stays put well enough. I'm using this with an IP phone, and the sound quality is, well, terrible. It works well enough if you just want to listen in on a conference call. But if you actually need to talk and need to be understood, you'll have to switch back to the handset. This actually happened to me on my last conference call. Maybe it would work better with an outboard amplifier?"
5,For 4 Runner,The description should say this 13094 is only for the Toyota 4 Runner.Product 13086 is for the Toyota pickup.
5,6 Books In One!!,"My kids loved this book so much they wore it out and I had to buy another one! If your kids love animals they will LOVE this book. It is 6 books in one, Baby Wild Animals, The Zoo Book, The Tiger Book, The Elephant Book, The Fish Book, and The Monkey Book. Lots of pictures and very educational."
3,decent Green Archer for the price,"Classic Super Heroes Collection (DVD) both Green Archer are complete. The Mill Creek Green Archer copy is a different source than Alpha studio's copy. Both studios source are from VHS. In Mill Creek Green Archer copy Both left and right have more details. The top is slightly more cropped than Alpha's. It also contains a missing scene from Alpha's copy, a couple seconds when Jory is a prisoner with gang interrogation. Mill Creek Green Archer copy is brighter, darker, sharper also. However, Chs 8 ff some scenes are too bright loosing details. A scene in ch 11 is missing but in Alpha's copy. Flash Gordon is too enlarged for some reason cropping top, left and right. I do not understand why everyone has to release another Flash Gordon. I bought this only for Green Archer. Image has best Flash Gordon. VCI and Super restored have best Archers."
3,I would have used another book had I known better,"The textbook is great if you think you have a solid grasp on Biblical Hebrew. The exercises concluding each lesson are wonderful, save for there not being a key within the book to help with potential incorrect transliterations and mistranslations.Mediocre at best."
4,Great for Class,"We used this as our first-year Hebrew text. The lack of an answer key makes it impractical for self-study, but I can't imagine learning Hebrew on my own. The paucity of exercises was a problem, but that is mitigated later on when you're able to actually translate text on your own if you want extra practice.I loved the simplicity of the paradigms listed as well as the mechanical parsing method. I feel like this book gave me a much better foundation for Hebrew than Mounce did for Greek."
4,Seasons of the Moon,"Although something I probably would not have picked up off the shelf in a bookstore, I am very glad that a colleague gave me her copy to read. It is a very well written book that I thoroughly enjoyed. I got this book one afternoon and was finished the next day. The story is unique and the characters are very well developed and you become invested in what is going to happen to them. I would recommend this to anyone."
2,could be better,Poorly written. Exercises not well described and not enough photos to demonstrate them. Not a bad overall program once you figure it out but it takes too much effort to decipher. I have learned much more from other books and (of course) from my trainer.
3,Basic Introduction to a Great Sport / Art,"The book gives a basic outline of the great American art of self-defense, Boxing. The author introduces the foundation to the necessary basics to train and compete, if desired. Yet, boxing is a hands on sport that must be physically executed to truly learn. A book can serve as a guide or to attempt to enlighten one to the basics, but without a coach or sparring partner it can never be understood.The recent trend to train in the exercises of a boxer has gained popularity because it is one of the toughest sports, if not the toughest, to obtain to appropriate amount of fitness in order to safely compete."
3,Just another wantabe book,This is a very basic book meant mostly for the beginner. There are many other books out there which will take the up and comming boxer well beyond the info in this book.
2,Not what I expected!!!,"The best of Chespirito Vol. 1 isn't what I thought it will be. I'm a big fan of all his characters. But I was thinking since I got Vol. 1 I will be seen some of the earlier episodes. It wasn't like that, they started with newest ones. They don't have the all original cast member, and it isn't the same. The episodes aren't as funny as the used to be. Another thing this DVD doesn't come with extras like some of the other DVDs of el chavo that I have. What they added as addional material were 4 tv spots that are 30 seconds long each. That really sucks!!! They only really good thing of this DVD are 2 episodes of El chavo del 8 that are really funny."
2,Only for the series completist,"If you enjoyed Ringo's ""Legacy of the Aldenata"" series, then you may enjoy finding out what happened to the universe 1000 years after the other books.Or, if you're a huge military SF fan and you like reading about Recon teams, you'll be pleased with the lengthy descriptions of the group slithering through the muck.Otherwise, skip this one. Thin plot, mostly stock characterizations, and a rushed ending. I've enjoyed other works by both authors, so this was a huge disappointment for me."
2,Why?,"Why was this book writtten? Does Ringo need money? The original Posleen series was fantastic. This and Callys War, they appear to be afterthoughts. Do authors cut and paste? Do they have left over thoughts that they throw together and call it a book?"
3,Just Barely OK.,"If you've read Ringo's other books about the legacy of the Aldenata, you probably know why this book should be more than OK. I'll tell you why I thought it was lacking. First of all, the characters were never people I could care about - well - maybe Ferret. I would have liked to know Tirdal's motivation regarding the artifact before the very frickin' end, and a good bit more information about the Darhel in general. The intro took way too long. There were also the story holes that never got filled in. Why didn't Tirdal ever need the enzymes from the camp? What the heck are the Bane Sidhe? Why are they special? Why were the local carnivores only dangerous at just the right moments of the story? The real problem comes back to the fact that none of the major characters ever became real people to me."
2,Not very original,"I'm a big fan of military SF books and movies, and this book was a little disappointing. This was because the plot was thin, and I got a sense of ""I've read this book before..."" feel from the book,but mostly the book was not very interesting. For example, (without giving too much away), one of the characters betrays the rest of the team for reasons there were...well, not original. Out of all the reasons the authors could have used for a book that was set in the future, the character's motivation was not original. I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't.On a positive note, I thought the military culture written in the book was well written. When references were made about their troop movements, or their weapons, it kind of reminded me of the ""Starship Troopers"" movie."
1,borrrring!!!!!!!,WOW. I was expecting exciting battles and fun action situations but instead received a yawnfest. Little character developement and very little species developement on the Darhel. Has the juice run out of the Posleen universe or are too many secondary writers diluting the stew. Callies War was bad this is just borrriing. The Posleen story line draws me in and then nothing new is explored.
1,Not up to Ringo standard,"Like many who have responded . . . this novel wasn't up to the standard I expected of a Ringo Posleen series book. Having served in small units similar to the DRT -- the ""fragging"" didn't seem plausible. Stopped reading after that chapter.Gave it one star for the first half of the read."
2,Not up to par,"If other authors feel the need to explore another authors world and expand on it, Please, Please study your material. This book is a 'cut and paste' version of 'I was there' war book. Just substitute the background setting with 'Vietnam' or 'Korea' or 'Bosnia'; substitute Darhel with the 'new guy'; or subsitute 'secret weapon' with the 'box' and its the same storyline. This was a tedious read for me. I gave up on it twice. But since I paid money for this book, I decided to read it to the very bitter end. Borrow a copy from a friend or see if your local library has a copy. This is just not a John Ringo book."
4,Gripping!,"The Hero is a top-rate action novel set 1000 years in the future of John Ringo's ""Legacy of the Aldenata"" universe. Williamson, the primary writer, does a fantastic job of creating engaging characters and keeping the pace of the story quick enough that you have a hard time putting the book down. His combat scenes are top-notch, gritty, and realistic.If the book has any weakness, it's that Ringo hasn't fully revealed his Aldenata universe to us, and that Williamson is unable to flesh the novel out with the backstory of the thousand year gap to save room for future novels set earlier in the universe.If you are able to look beyond that limitation, the book is incredibly enjoyable, well written, and just a plain fun read."
2,"Ho-Hum - Not ""Ringo-esque"" AT ALL","John Ringo has a Rep for mind blowing Action stories. I own Most of them. But this....kinda was a major let-down. Great build up, great charater development then Bam instantly boring. Dragged out to an unsatisfactory ending. The ""Hero"" was not a character that is easy to identify with or like, the Villan was almost Melodramatic. I was waiting for him to ""Twirl his mustache"" in an Evil manner.Sorry Folks, NOT a keeper."
3,Neither Author's Best,"I'm a huge fan of Michael Z. Williamson and I've enjoyed Ringo's Posleen War books but The Hero is a book that frankly lacks the best qualities of either author. As other reviewers have noted, The Hero is less a work of military sci-fi and more a character study. This character study, focusing as it does on the mysterious Darhel, was interesting but unnecessarily lengthy. The book could have been much shorter.Set roughly 1,000 years after the conclusion of the Posleen War series, The Hero takes place in an interesting universe of intergalactic war, human political conflict and the colonization of frontiers. Regrettably, this setting is explored little and largely treated as background noise to a slow-paced psychological thriller.In short, the book had its strong moments but reaching these moments took far longer than it should have. As a fan of both authors, I was fairly disappointed."
3,Slow to start and hard to read.,"This is the third spinoff of John Ringo's Aldenata series, all with different co-authors. So far I've only liked ""Watch on the Rhine"" and even that took a while to get interesting.""The Hero"" takes place about a thousand years after the original books and human space is being threatened by another alien species called the Blob. It involves a Deep Recon Team (DRT) investigation of a Blob installation on a planet. At least it should involve that, in reality it involves the conflict between three members of that team.Most of the book is slow, but devoting the first nine chapters of a 21 chapter book to the introduction of the characters is too much. I never did identify with any of the characters and when most are killed off my reaction was ""who cares"".If there is another book in this spinoff, I might read it, but I won't be looking to buy it like I will some other series that I've been following."
2,Disapointed Fan,"First of all, I just wanted to comment that I am a huge fan of the Polseen universe and Mr. Ringo's body of work. Well, except for this book.The characterizations were not engaging, the action sequences lacked ""snap"", the overall plot was rather tiresome and the ending was very disappointing. Actually the ending is horrid. What I did enjoy was learning a bit more about the ""Elves"" as well as brushing against some other aspects of the Polseen universe and its history.Mr. Ringo is a skilled storyteller who has brought me countless hours of happy reading. I look forward to what comes out next in the Polseen universe but I have to recommend that people skip this book."
1,High-Pitched Wave Music,"I love every other HOS CD I have bought, but I was very disappointed with this purchase. If you like high-pitched electronic wave music that has no melody, form, or ambience, then you will like this CD."
3,Too sentimental and trite,"I appreciate the good intentions of the author and I understand that he's not trying to create great literature here. But I found the book overly sentimental and trite. (Think ""The Wonder Years""-LITE). It reads like an after-school special.With everyone and their grandmother writing memoirs, a higher quality of writing sophistication is needed to stand out. I gave this book a 3 instead of a 2 because I think this book would be a good book to read in an eighth grade English class. For adults who crave more depth and wit, this book will not cut it."
4,A Witty and Insightful Tale,"Mark Salzman tell a witty and insightful of his less-than-normal adolescence set in suburbia Connecticut and the culture of the 70s. The story follows Mark from grade school through college and with the recounts of his experiences; you might catch yourself laughing out loud. Mark trains to be an astronaut by sitting in a cardboard box, walks barefoot to school to attain enlightenment and does push-ups on asphalt covered with broken glass in an attempt to become a kung fu master. Many of these experiences and the characters in the book seem to be a bit exaggerated, but the exaggerations often make the story even more interesting. These hilarious and sometimes ridiculous experiences allow Salzman to explore larger ideas about adolescence and finding yourself and your relationship with the universe. I would recommend this book because it is an easy read, as well as comical and intuitive."
4,Zen and the art of adolescence at its finest.,This book was so full of humor and true to life situations that it had me from the first page. Salzman captures the ability of the adolescnet mind to lose itself in a world of its own creation. I thought the last 1/4 of the book was a little slow and could of picked up a little. But all in all it was a very good book. I read it in less than a day.
4,Through the years,"I would recommend Mark Salzman's ""Lost in Place"" beacuse it pays great attention to detail and gives a play by play of the author's experiences growing up. It describes how the author wanted to be an astronaut, a kung fu master, a cellist and finally a professor of Chinese philosophy and language. The book begins when the author is about 11 and ends when the author is about 21, so it describes on of the most interesting times in almost anyone's life. Through this book you can relive your adolescence, your first relationship, your first big party and you first college experiences. As Salzman tells of the events of his life he is constantly striving to find meaning in it all and finally pulls some out in the end. Being taken through these experiences will make you laugh and will seriously make you question how you ever lived through that time in you life and came out okay"
4,A Highly Recommended Read,"In reading Mark Salzman's Lost In Place, I felt that the narrative was an easy read and very interesting. The characters, with their unique antics and personalities, gave an almost humorous appeal to life and growing up in the suburbs. Although the characters themselves were not easy to relate to, the ideas that were the basis of the book (self-identity, motivation, coming-of-age) made this a novel that would be applicable to almost any brilliant mind. As a narrative, it is satisfying to know that there was someone who went through a similar childhood, wanting to impress those who were important and wanting to know the purpose of one's existence. Overall, the narrative was marvellously written, and I reccommend it to anyone who wishes to write their own novel someday."
3,Enjoyable after time,"When first reading Mark Salzman's ""Lost In Place"", I thought it was an enjoyable and easy read. But I did not recieve any deeper meaning behind the characters or the plot- at first! However, after reviewing the book, I began to feel a greater connection between the author and the characters. The trials and tribulations that the author faced while growing up can be related to everyone's adolescence at one time or another. Also, the style that the author used throughout the book made me want to continue to turn the page to see what happened next!"
5,Laughed out loud,"Memoir of Mark Salzman's adolescent years in Connecticut. Outrageously funny in spots, touching in others, and interesting throughout. The author's description of Sensei O'Keefe and the stories surrounding the Kung Fu Dojo are riotous. Ed, his eternally pessimistic father, adds another element of humor to the story. The novel describes an eccentric teenager's failed attempts to ""change myself into something I'm not. The story of my life."" He obsessively pursues first Kung Fu to become a fearless warior, then years of cello training to achieve a dream of becoming a concert celloist, and majors in Chinese at Yale because ""it was the one subject I had a head start in and could therefore look smarter than I really was."" The book is a good reflection back on the eccentricities of adolescence with a profound message offered in the end."
1,Painful to Listen To,"Fiddling With TraditionThis comic music is absolutely painful to listen to. Of course I'm not a fan of ""rap"", even for comedy's sake... That being said, there is a yuk factor, but it's not the kind of thing I can play more than a couple times. So unless you're a fan of rap AND a fan of Jewish humor, you might want to bypass this one."
1,Treasure Island Book,The book shown is not the book I received. I received a children's edition written in an abridged manner with more illustrations than words. I was looking for the unabridged copy and thought by the picture this was an older version of the book and would be what I needed. This seemed like false advertising.
4,"Tiny, lasting, fragrant bubbles","I love the scent and was pleasantly surprised to find that the bubbles are small (hence 'foam bath' rather than 'bubble bath') and lasting. I like to take long baths and the bubbles last the whole time.The scent is not at all cloying -- very nice.I don't have dry skin, so I don't know whether the supposedly oatmeal whatever that is part of the ingredients helps dry skin, as the ads claim. Soluble fiber (found in oatmeal) is supposed to have a good effect on skin.My only minor criticism of this product is my skin feels a bit soapy when I get out, so I rinse off with clear water. Duh! How is it supposed to clean if it doesn't have some surfactant effect? So it's probably not fair to criticize the product for this attribute."
2,lavender???,"Doesn't smell any.... where is lavender??? It might have great effect as described, but I bought more for relaxing aroma :("
3,Nothing special--but it makes bubbles...,"I agree with previous reviews that the bubbles are small and don't last long. If you just want a few bubbles with very little scent, this is a decent bubble bath. If you want something that smells good and creates long-lasting bubbles, do not use this product. However, I have no idea if there are any medical benefits--it certainly doesn't make your skin tingle or feel any different than before the bath."
1,The positive reviews are lying,"I have used this 3 times so far and it has not made ANY bubbles. I am so disappointed. I did everything right, even shook the bottle. I squeeze some out under the faucet and it makes really tiny insignificant ""bubbles"" and by the time I get in the bath, they are all gone and what's left is cloudy water. Waste of money! Only positive thing is that it smells good. I don't notice that my skin is softer."
5,Great Bubble Bath,"Even if this weren't such a good price, this would be a good buy, because the product is so good. As others have mentioned, it is very mild and yet effective. I enjoy baths, but don't want to smell like a fruit bowl after I'm done. I don't know if it's the product or the bath, but I feel better afterwards.I recommend this very highly to anyone with sensitive skin."
3,3 Stars 2 B Nice!!,"To begin with Cosmic Gate did a great job on mixing CD 1, I liked his choice of tracks, but the only downside was the songs were too short. CD 2 was horrible, and took my ratings of 4 stars...down to 3 stars. I'm using CD 2 as a coaster right now!"
3,Not bad,"This cream was OK.Not bad, not great.It moistured my skin nicely all right.That's all I can say."
5,Cream it.,Clean and scent less. The best on The market for any skin. All the Vani products are great. Try the heavier lotion or hair gel which is all natural and water based.
1,More Like Wrestling,Let me just say this book was very very boring I mean this is the first worst coming of age story I ever had to read I didn't get any of it at all it's like I had to force myself to finish this book when I should've just stop reading it was just that boring it was not fast pace it was slow and to think this is this author's first book the first book always suppossed to make a good impression but this one has fail. I know I will not be reading anything from this author again.
4,She looks good.,"I liked this book. It took a while to get into, but once crack cocaine hit, she found her stride. I may have written that wrong, but I meant it well."
3,good way to describe readinging this book,"I pickedp up this book with great expectations,However i found this book very hard to get into. The dialouge was weighed down.Usually i can read a book like this a few days but i couldnt get into the flow of charactors. I agree with previous reviewer for Ms Smith to be journalist i expected a smoother flow in dialouge. The subject matter was great and reading about black youth coming of age in Oakland i could relate to. Reading this book was very labor intensive."
2,A struggle,"As much as I hate to say it, I found this book to be a great disappointment. I hate to say it because I expected a great deal from Ms. Smith based on her work with Vibe magazine. After reading the jacket cover, I was all set to settle in for an enjoyable read. The problem is, the book never seemed to go anywhere, making the read a slow and laborious one. The story moved along at a snails pace and never seemed to take off. Despite the plot twists (and admittedly,there were a few), the story started off flat and remained that way. I will admit that I only got 3/4 of the way through and that it may have picked up at the end. But I doubt it. And in my opinion, it wasn't worth the struggle to find out."
2,???,"I don't know if this was a good or bad recording.Actually,I don't have much opinion one way or the other.The whole album sounded like one piece of music stretched out for an hour.I listened to it 4 or 5 times,never got anything out of it,and traded it off.If this is what is called <Ambient>I don't think I'll be spending more time or money on it."
2,Not in agreement,"...I buy a climbing video for the climbing footage, and there were long segments of kickboxing footage on this video. So long, in fact, that it took a significant amount of time to fast forward through them! Another gripe - a woman bouldering with the male spotter grabbing her butt - come on, Paul Dusatko! Women watch climbing videos, too! I enjoyed some of the bouldering footage in Europe, despite my jumpy tape, but the editing of some of the route climbing was less than exciting. And I personally did not like the sound track, although this is a matter of personal taste."
3,Couldn't put it down.,"A quick-paced, enlightening book, it gives hope to those suffering the ravages of depression."
5,"""Did I Create the Sky?...""","beautifully written, these spiritual meditations are some of kerouac's best and most humble, opening up the quiet side of kerouac often overlooked, simply amazing"
4,A feminsist/womanist critique of The Femme Mystique,"This book is a poignant analysis of the often dichotomized butch-femme roles within the lesbian community. Via a collection of independent writings, the work highlights an often stigmatized and misunderstood group--the femme lesbian. Through touching, and often sensual stories of love and the search for an identity as ""a femme,"" this book allows a rarely viewed glimpse into the hearts, minds, and bodies of these women. Despite the quality of this book, I would have liked to see more explicit discussion of the lives of femme women of color. Sadly, their absence risks recapitulating the same ""othering"" that many women in this book discuss. The familiar arguments of feminist/womanist women of color--that we are largely absent from important discourse on women-- can be asserted with this text as well. Nevertheless, it is a powerful book and hopefully future editions will more directly address such issues."
3,A wee bit repetitive,"The book was good and I don't regret buying it but I tried to sit down and read it all the way through and soon was bored and frustrated. There are some great essays in there about the butch/femme dynamic and what it means to be a femme in the lesbian community but theres a great deal of repetition and I started feeling like I was reading the same essay over and over.. and over again. It's a nice book, but I won't be re-reading it anytime soon. If I could recommend a book it would be 'Out of the Closet and Nothing to Wear' instead."
4,"A Must Read For Any "" Femme"" inine Woman","My Girlfriend is femme and I am a butch. She just got this book yesterday and already is more than 1/2 through it!!! She cannot put the book down. Leslea has a superb righting style that makes the reader relate easily--my girlfriend has said many times ""that's exactly how I feel!!"" Coming from a small rural area we are not in contact w/ many other femme- butch couples this book is a great source of entertainment as well as info."
4,Networking is rough.. the rest is excellent (newbie),"Having never touched oracle as a DBA, I have used this series to easily pass the first two exams. Don't believe the folks that tell you these exams require hands on experience (although I am sure it would help).After reading the Networking section (100 pages) at least 3 times, it finally started to come together. However, there are still large disconnects in my mind. The author assumes you know too much about the overall networking environment. A few more schematics and some better explanations would serve us much better.Backup and Recovery (user managed and server managed) are covered very well.I passed the exam last month and thought the test standards seemed kind of low. Definitely low enough for a reader of this book alone to pass. The test required 41/63 questions to pass and I passed by a 15 question margin.Thank you Mr. Velpuri."
2,Not in-depth enough,The real exam questions were more difficult than what this book prepares you for. Buggy software on the CD Rom. Use this book only as a study outline.
2,Please Get Away,"The music isn't all that bad, but I was very dissapointed. I was expecting Princess Stephanie of Monaco. THIS IS NOT PRINCESS STEPHANIE OF MONACO. If I were you I would save your money until the real thing comes along."
4,Yes a Princess but not from Monaco.,"In all fairness I couldn't help but reply to the previous ignorant review. If you think this is ""Princess Stephanie of Monaco"" I suggest you come out of your shell and educate yourself! This is Stephanie who helped make '80's dance freestyle ( commonly known as ""bubblegum"" music ) what it is today. She was one of the first female artists to give us those bass-booming, latin beat influence ""heartbreak"" music. If you know anything about ""freestyle"" music you know what I mean. Look at Debbie Deb, Shannon, Meg, Judy Torres, and Cynthia ( for example ) and then you'll know where Stephanie fits in. Stephanie's ""Get Away"" album drops hard and rolling beats mixed in with a couple slow songs. Her vocals are fine and the production is exceptional. If you liked the dance music scene in New York and Miami in the late '80's, early '90's, you'll enjoy Stephanie. ""Fighting Back the Tears"" is the type of song which will send shivers down your spine. Great beat! This is Stephanie!"
1,sqeaky balls,cocker spaniel tore into the ball within 5 minutes and had it in shreds...luckily i was watching him or he might have choked...thought they were more like a tennis ball!!! possibly good for very small dogs but no indication of that when ordering!!
3,"Content: good, weight: bad","This book is quite well written. Using one application and buildingit in the course of a book is a good idea. However, it's a bit thin(189 pages) and it doesn't address too much content out of the scope of the project under construction. There were a lot of time I'd like to have seen some more in-depth information."
3,"There are 1/5 sands in the powder,but another one has no send","Rresently, I bought a battle of Nowfoods - Barley Grass Powder - 2 lb.It is horrible.If you take of one teaspoon of barley grass powder, there is 1/5 sandsin the grass powder.My husband is a colon cancer survivor, he needs to take barley grass powder every day.He is very hard to swollen it and after he took it, he made a face and diarrhea, so I have to buyanother barley for him.(my husband had a stroke.He can tell how he felt.)So I have to try it.Wow! after I drake the powder with water, I felt full of my mouthis sands, specially, between my teeth.I have to use a lot of water to rinse the mouth., but there is still some sands there.When I bought one more bottle, there is no send,so I change my review now."
2,"Ummm, Maybe Another Brand",I drink barley grass for its supposed benefits and for the benefits of juicing in general. I recently ran out and purchased this brand because it was fairly cheap. My verdict: too grainy and it left a barley grass 'sludge' at the bottom of the glass that was very difficult to finish! Not dissing barley grass at all...but I'm honestly not fond of this brand.
5,Fresh and easy to use,This item was fresh out of the bottle easy to mix and not overpowering like most. Wide opening easy to access the product we will buy again.
3,Barley Grass Powder,It was kind of grettie. Have trouble mixing the barley grass powder in my juice. It did not desolve very well.
3,ALMOST,"Stephen Hill, of Hearts of Space, knows good from not so good when it comes to Ambient music. And so, this c.d. was a bit of a disappointment for me. HOS produced this album, TRISTESSE, by Paul Sauvenet. Was so hoping tracks 2/3/4/5 would, in some measure, come up to the heart-stopping, ravishing beauty of the first cut on the album: Adieu. But they don't, not even close. If you don't mind having one superior selection containing classical as well as ambient qualities to the music (and I certainly don't), and then four selections that don't approach the beauty of that first song, you might like this c.d. I like it; wanted to love it. I sampled it on and then it purchased from, Amazon."
3,Could be better...,"My 3-year-old son loves trucks, and was fascinated by a monster truck show he saw on TV one evening. So I bought this video for him. He likes it a lot, so it gets some stars. But half the enjoyment of monster trucks, at least as I see it, is the noise they make. And most of the trucks in this video are silent -- their awesome noise completely covered by music. Well, at least the music is pretty good -- powerful rocking stuff. But I think my little boy would be more interested in hearing the truck's true sounds. On top of that flaw, the editors have introduced some special effects with the video footage -- I guess they don't think plain old monster trucks crunching over everything in sight and crashing and rolling on the ground is exciting enough. Not too many effects, but more than necessary. So not a perfect monster truck video. At least there isn't any annoying narration!"
1,Very interesting...,"The review from Joseph Judge is exeactly the same (word-for-word) as Kidz Bop 1. I smell a corporate plant.For those saying that it's not for adults ""but your kids will love it"", must have little robots instead of kids. I let my 3 year old daughter listen to these things after hearing the originals, and not only did she know the difference, but she absulotely HATED the Kidz Bop versions.If there was a negative star rating, this line of CDs would get it."
1,I'm about to go insane,"To all the parents that say these cd's are not as bad as they thought, I guess that means they were expecting to listen to a Yoko Ono cd. Actually, having to listen to this is much worse than listening to a screeching woman. I personally think that the singers should do us parents a favor and stop singing permanantly (not to mention, those kids could use voice lessons). I can't think of one good thing to say about Kidz Bop...even my 4 year old triplets all hate this. When we listened to this in the car, I had a strong urge to drive off a cliff. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF AND DON'T BUY THIS CD.PS-I hope they stop those annoying commercials, too."
2,I don't believe this...,"These kids do not understand the meanings of the damn songs. ""Dilemma"" was obviously a kid's song but I don't get how this hapenned... I mean...How could---Next thing you know they'll be singing ""Me and My Girlfriend""(and not Jay Z's but 2pac's original one). Or no wait they'll probably be singing Eminem songs, yeah like ""Kim"" and ""Cleaning Out My Closet."" Save yourself a dissappointment(I WAS NOT CRAZY ENOUGH TO BUY THIS!!) and buy some GOOD music... Tribute's are not very easy to make, so I understand how tough it was(especially with kids singing it, running around the room. Why'd I have to bring that up??)."
1,dont buy,"DONT BUY!!! this cd is for little little little little kids who can't listen to innapropriate music. these kidz bop cd's make me sick. listen to the radio or buy the real songs with the words bleeped out. you can get them on itunes i think and just burn them on a cd. also, the little kids who sing on them (who are like 5 by the way) get really annoying and they make you want to slap them. these cd's kill really good songs and just kill really good bands. just buy the real thing, just bleeped out so your precious little kids dont learn mean words and things about the real world."
1,YOU WILL HATE THIS TOO!!!,Oh the humanity!! More songs sung by unknown adults and kids who can't sing like Professionals?! They must be CRAZY!!
1,YOU WILL LIKE THIS FIRST TIME OUT (IT SHOULD BE 5 STARS),"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT MANY FORMER STARS SUCH AS MICKEY MANTLE, TED WILLIAMS AND SANDY KOUFAX PLAYING THE FINAL GAME OF THEIR CAREER. AUTHOR JOHN NOGOWSKI GIVES US A BIT ABOUT THEIR CAREER THEN GOES INTO DETAIL ABOUT THE LAST GAME OF EACH PLAYER ALONG WITH THE BOX SCORE. HE ALSO PROVIDES SOME GREAT PICTURES AND COMPLETE SEASON BY SEASON LIFETIME STATS. YOU GET ALOT IN THIS BOOK. I READ THIS IN 2 DAYS. HOPE MR. NOGOWSKI PUTS OUT ANOTHER BOOK LIKE THIS SOON. VERY RECOMMENDED.."
3,Largely disappointing,"firstly this reviewer is a racer and has quite some experience in the various disciplines of AR (adventure racing) so bear that in mind.The book is quite well laid out covering most things you might expect in AR. The exciting glossy cover belies the lower quality paper and pictures used within- no smart glossies inside, rather some average b/w photos.The information inside is fine but can largely be found elsewhere with a quick google search. Still a good repository of information.If you are looking for some guidance re AR equipment, training, techniques, tips and have not looed for the same on the web, this will be a useful book, if you have looked then it is something to have on the bookshelf. It is not of sufficient quality to have out on the coffee table as a conversation piece!My 2cents."
2,Boring,"I was expecting to see more of the daily life of the nuns rather than almost all interviews. I viewed ""Into Great Silence"" and love that movie and was expecting something similar. If you like movies with interviews, you will like this one"
4,The Silence of Righteousness,"I have always wondered why anyone would sign up for Poverty, Chastity and Obedience and this film shed light on the women who have. Very respectfully produced, No Greater Love provides insight into the lives lived by these holy women and traces their days through prayer, chores, rituals and conversations. They live a life of quiet and meditation but are far more aware of what is going on in the outside world than they might let on. This film shows what a life in love with God looks like within the context of Catholic culture and offers some surprises."
3,Will little ones get the concept?,"When I looked through this book, it was as an adult who had read Booklist's review and knew what the concept was supposed to be. However, even knowing that ahead of time, I had difficulty figuring out the connection between what was going on in the picture and what it had to do with a real circus.Once I did pick up what those parallels were supposed to be, I found them to be extremely boring! There is no real story line, no satisfying ending. In addition, the illustrations are rather dark and not very inviting.The book has practically no text, which is a big part of the problem. More verbal cues would have been a help, for both children and the adults who are sharing the book with them. (Such as, ""Who looks like the tightrope walker?"")"
4,What a fun demonstration of imagination,"This book uses shadows of real life scenes that become circus characters as a child anticipates the coming event. It's an apt exploration of a child's imagination, and would work well in a circus unit to discuss characters and expand vocabulary for a primary class."
3,Not such a fan,"I bought this wordless picture book on a whim because it was on a very good sale. I planned to give it to my niece's pre-k teacher, with a bunch of other wordless picture books.I don't like it that much. One of the good things about wordless books, I think, is that they're... well... wordless. If - as in this book - you have to be able to read incidental signs to understand what's going on then it's not really wordless, is it?But the pictures are subtle enough that even WITH the signs it's not always clear what you're looking for. Might as well have gone all the way and included some narration.I'll still give the book, but I won't buy a copy for me."
3,Not what I thought ...,This book's description and what it was did not meet my expectations. I really thought that the shadows would more closely resemble circus items.
1,Disappointing,"I enjoyed Krasnow's first book, ""Surrendering to Motherhood,"" but can't say this one is worth reading. It goes on and on about....nothing.Here are some of the things that make Krasnow happy and help her to rediscover who she is: Working out with her trainer, getting away to the beach without her husband or kids, drinking coffee in her peaceful riverfront kitchen and feeling sorry for the poor souls who have to fight traffic to get to work at dawn, going away to an expensive sleepaway camp with her sons, and driving her shiny, sporty Ford Escape that reminds of her being young, carefree and childfree (she uses an additional car to tote the boys around town).For those of us without the luxury of time, a third personal car, a personal trainer, a rich husband, etc, it will be a little more difficult to re-discover our souls. We're too busy paying bills, working, trying to find the time to spend with our children, friends and husbands."
2,Amazing book,"I am awestruck...not because the book is terrific but because some people have figured out (or found agents who've figured out) how to write books about incredibly obvious things -- and make a handsome living at it. Furthermore, I love it when rich people tell me to put my feet up and savor the ""good life,"" a life they probably wouldn't be able to savor themselves if they didn't get handsome checks for writing dreck like this. I haven't learned this much from a book since Suze Orman told me to look behind the sofa cushions for spare change."
3,Inspirational,"I have owned this book for many years, and toted it around every time I move house. I still find many beautiful things to interest and inspire me in Maria's work. I wish I knew more about her and her work."
4,blue bracelet,"This is a wonderful bracelet. It matches my daughters graduation dress. We like it so much, we might purchase another one. We received it in a great amount of time; arrived sooner than we thought and the price was great!"
4,Feel Gods Love in Sandi Patti's voice,"If you need encouragement, turn to the sounds of Sandi Patti. She sings her praises to the lord and you can feel the spirit listen. Sandi Patti is a great contempary christian artist."
2,Not her best,"I was hoping for better when I bought this CD, but I found that it more boring than uplifting."
5,new carb,"i replaced my old carb with this one on a second generation chevy camaro with a 350. i tryed rebuilding the old one but it was useless. this carb is bolt and go. i did not have to make any adjustments and it was easy to install. the car started right up, and has run great ever since, no more hard starting or stalling. i would recomend this carb for replacement and it is good for regular street driving"
3,Pedestal Cake Plate,Square cake stand is nice crystal. Just wish that it was more level. Used for shower cake and everyone loved it.
5,Happy with this purchase,"I looked quite a while for a square footed cake plate. I normally do not order online, but since this was something I wanted I decided to take a chance. After I placed my order the cake plate came in 3 days...really quickly. I opened the box and the first one I received was completely shattered! I was disappointed, however I went online, went throught the very easy return process (not having to pay shipping or anything for the return item) and within another 3 days I had the new cake plate! I could not believe how easy the return process with amazon was. And to say a bit about the cake plate itself. It is very heavy and solid crystal. It is beautiful."
5,Good service,"I have a craving for Altoids Sugar Free Cinnamon gum. It is very cinnamony and really makes your mouth taste fresh. Unfortunately, it is hard to find and it is easier and less expensive to purchase it online through Amazon.It was sent promptly and with no fuss. I plan to use this vehicle in future purchases"
4,For new Tai Chi members only,"I only rated this DVD a 4 star because it is for people who have never taken Tai Chi. The title is a bit misleading. 6 forms aren't given. 6 movements are taught in one form, the simplified Yang form. As a person with intermediate Tai Chi experience I was hoping for expanded forms. This DVD is for a complete novice. As such, it is very good. The movements are given from the front, back and side so novices can easily copy the movements. Especially helpful even for an intermediate student was how the instructor pointed out common mistakes students make in the various movements. The lessons get longer as the student goes through them. The end of the DVD gives references to more advanced videos as well as Tai Chi movements for specific ailments. If you want to learn about Tai Chi without taking a class, this is a very good start. As a reference for more advances students, it is not really worth it."
3,To be fair...,"It's tough to teach OR learn tai chi by video. It's true that the production quality is amateurish, the movements can be hard to follow for a beginner (which I am), and the way in which the 6 lessons are presented is annoyingly choppy. On the other hand, Dr. Lam provides valuable details on proper form and common mistakes - and the warm up, cool down and qigong exercises are good. I'm glad I bought the video - it met my expectations and I've learned from it."
2,It's okay...,"This DVD was a little hard for me to follow. The filming is kind of low budget too. I would not recommend it for a complete beginner. The title says ""6 Easy Lessons"" but I had a hard time getting through the first ""easy lesson."""
1,FRUSTRATING,"Absolute worst instructional video for a beninner I can possibly imagine. It may be fine for someone who knows the bare basics, but for someone who has never attempted Tai Chi, stay away from this one! Dr. Lam does, indeed, break down the forms, step by step - but he very quickly shows one step, very quickly you view the step with his assistant (from behind), and once more with ""the class"". That's it, move on, next step. Don't know how to *smoothly* get your hands from point a to point b because you were trying to pay attention to the feet? Don't know how to coordinate the feet & hands? Feeling completely akward? Too bad, next step! Definitely NOT relaxing and meditative."
2,Frustrating and Disappointing,"I've been very excited to try Tai Chi for a while now, but found it frustrating and ultimately impossible to watch Dr. Lam's video. Four key reasons why this didn't work for me:1) The pacing is all wrong. There is not enough time for me to emulate what the instructors are presenting before they move to something else. It also continually shifts from position to position, and I lose track of where I should be starting from and moving to.2) There is no philosophy taught behind the movements. I wanted to know a bit about the reason for each of the movements and the philosophy of Tai Chi.3) These are real-life people who have no stage training. Their talking is stilted and disjointed.4) The production quality is low. The navigational elements are minimal, and the studio set looks like a junior-high production.Ultimately, I'm now shopping for another DVD that I can actually watch and from which I can learn something."
1,Confused,"I'm confused how anyone could rate this DVD five stars??? Are Dr. Lam's friends writing in? This is by far the WORST instructional video I have ever seen. Talk about low budget...it looks like it was filmed in somebody's basement!I've never written in a review before, but I feel compelled to warn people not to be deceived here. This video is truly awful. A complete waste of money. Nothing to be learned. Sorry, but there is just not one single redeeming quality about it."
2,made like an instruction manual,"This video breaks Tai Chi into pieces. The instructor of the film doesn't practice Tai Chi; one of his students stands by him (a mute white adult male) and moves through a given maneuver. He then holds it, and the instructor explains what he has done. After a short, uncomfortable silence between the two, the instructor nudges him to move forward, and the mime progresses to the next step.If you like reading manuals and don't want to watch this more than say... once... then I reckon this is a great movie. He does go through the steps, he shows very well and throughly what it means to hold your hand upright, what a ""straight"" back means, etc. This kind of piece-mail approach is thus somewhat scientific, though I felt entirely mechanistic."
1,Tai Chi 6 forms 6 easy lessons,I recently received this DVD after it was on back order for over 3 months and it will not play on my DVD player or on the DVD-ROM drive on my computer. My computer gives me an error message saying it is not readable. Do not buy this DVD until the technical problems are resolved!!
5,perfect for backpacking in western europe,"I backpacked through the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and Germany, staying in hostels, over 3 weeks and this book was perfect. Useful phrases and very handy mini-dictionary for each language. The pronunciation guide was a lifesaver!"
4,"Handy size, needs no batteries, but not without issues","Very handy pocket-sized guide with good selection of phrases/vocabulary. This may need some updating -- for example, ""SIM card"" is included but ""wifi"" is not. Print is too small for middle-aged eyes. The French and German pronunciation guides are OK but my Danish and Dutch friends laughed themselves silly at the examples."
3,READ the description for compatibility first!,Didn't work for my iPhone 4. Should have read the description. Assumed it would work since the chargers are all compatible between the iphones and the ipod touches.
1,Cheap quality product,"I received a defective piece. So it didn't work at all. But regardless of that, I could just feel the cheap plastic material that its made off. It wouldn't have lasted much anyway. Returning it to the vendor."
1,Didn't work!,This cable didn't pass audio at all in the itouch or iPhone. It did not even stop audio from passing through the headphones.
4,Pretty Good Cable,I bought this for the new Ipod Nano. I got this to use in my pickup. I have a Eclipse Head Unit with the Aux Input cable witch is connected to this cable. Although it does provide a true line out it didn't play has loud as I thought it would. Cd's and the radio were louder. I usually listen to the Radio and Cd's around 36-42 volume setting. With this it's around 55-60. It could be related to the path the sound needs to travel. Through two cables. I had a Sansa Fuze which doesn't have a true line out. Was using a 3.5 mm to rca cable connected to the earphone jack and it seemed to play louder. That's why I give it a 4.
1,Does not work with iPod Nano 5G,"I know it's been stated before, but I just wanted to add to the growing list of complaints about this product not actually being adaptable to all iPods. I ordered a 5th generation Nano hoping to play it through my home stereo system, only to find sound coming out of the tiny built in speaker. I searched in vain for an internal setting that would fix the problem, but after a brief online search I discovered that others were had this problem too. Next time I'll make sure to read the reviews *before* purchasing..."
3,Not iPhone compatible,"This cable works great and sounds great with an older iPod, but my iPhone 4 won't play through it - even with the cable plugged in, it plays through the internal speaker and does not pass audio to the line out pins of the connector."
1,Not compatible with iPhone,"This product had wonderful reviews and that is why I chose to buy. Since iPhone is also an ""iPod"", I incorrectly assumed it would be compatible. It is not compatible with iPhone so beware."
1,Doesn't work!,"If you have an IPOD touch, this product will not work. This information should have been included so customers could make the correct purchase decision. Guess it works with older IPODs."
4,good sound,"I have an amp to power my cd, cassette, phono, vcr and WII system. I had an extra port so I was able to plug right in.It words great and the sound quality is as good or better than the other components I currently have."
5,Great item!,We used this at our wedding to hook up our ipod to our stereo.Does exactly what it says. Sounds great!
4,Happy with product,"This product has been a key element in getting the clutter of the CD pile out of my living room. First I bought a cable from Bestbuy that connects the RCA jacks to the headphone jack of the ipod. That sucked. The music was muffed and I was miffed. My daughter had a little speaker set that docked the ipod and it sounded better so I surmised that the difference was the dock connection vs. the earphone connection. I think I was right. I was considering buying the Bose speaker dock ($400 and still no FM or CD capabilities) but then I was able to use this cable to connect ipod to existing home stereo. In iTunes preferences I selected the highest quality bit rate and selected AAC files. This works pretty good. I'm sure true audiophiles will still notice some of the music is missing, but it's good enough for most of my listening."
1,Did not work as described in the product description,"I ordered this item based on the product description that I would be able to connect my iPod to my stereo system and control the volume of the music from my stereo. When used this connector, there was no music coming through my stereo. I tried a couple of times and it still did not work. I returned the item."
1,Disappointment,"I bought it for my iPod touch, clearly not a good idea. It didn't work. I probably should have read up a bit more."
3,"Beware, it doesn't work with iPhones","I bought this cable, hoping against hope that it would work with my iphone. Beware, it doesn't. The seller doesn't pretend otherwise, but neither is it explicitly said that the cable is not made for iphone. No complaints. I had figured a cable is a cable, and after all an iphone is also an ipod so it should work. But like everything that Apple makes, there is always a catch. So all those people who want to buy it for their iPhone: DON'T!And if anyone has any suggsetions for where to buy a cable that will allow my iPhone's ipod to play music on my hi-fi system through the line connector, please come ahead."
1,Junk,"This product does not work at all on a Ipod or Iphone , no sound comes from amy home stereo piece I hook it to."
5,this cable is the bomb,"This cable is EXACTLY what ""Colton Cat"" described and the sound of the ipod using this cheap cable, is totally and absolutely the bomb. I just plugged my ipod into my home stereo and can't believe the difference in the sound, between using the headphone jack (before) and now, directly input into the iPod. The sound is fuller and richer, with a greater frequency response seen on my amp guage and in my own very ears. I'll never by a headphone to receiver jack again. Can't believe what we've been missing all these years."
2,Not quuite for a true beginner,"I was disappointed with this approach to teaching the language. The book goes from explaining grammar and pronunciation right into dialog, with no pronunciation or sentence structure breakdown accompanying the dialog sentences. Unless you take to the cyrillic alphabet right away, there will be a lot of flipping back and forth to try to figure out the words. The pace presented was just not a beginner's pace. The spoken words on the tapes are not always clear and unless you have the book in front of you in a quiet room, they're difficult to follow. The overall contents of the package may be thorough but for someone truly starting from scratch, this set was not a good first step. I couldn't get past lesson one without giving up in frustration."
2,Challenge for Speaker of Mongolian,"I have a BA in Mongolian Language (old script) and wanted to find a book to review and bring it back. I saw that this book was rated as difficult and fast moving by most reviewers so I figured it would be great for me. I ordered the set with a book and CD. The book is indeed hard to follow and lacking in a lot of clarity and missing needed explanations. The CDs are sadly read very monotone, which for a language that is full of excitement in intonation is a pity. If I were to use this book as a true beginner with Mongolian I can see that it would be quite frustrating.If you have a background in Mongolian language this book will help you to review the language. Mongolian and Japanese are very similar in their syntax so maybe it will be easier to learn if you speak Japanese, but there is still a lot of lack in clarity and ease of use in this book. It doesn't seem to grasp the true essence of the language."
2,It's not a good colloquial book,"Despite the book title, it is not a book that someone who's not studying it professionally should take. With very little preparation, the author goes right into discussing complex grammar and noun cases. The dialog is very formal and will not be very useful in normal conversation. It's better for the scholars than the average speakers.The cassetts are generally clear, however, because of the fast pace, it's very hard to follow for someone who does not have the mongolian ear."
4,Best Mongolian textbook available!,This is a very thorough book and provides an excellent foundation. It familiarizes students with Mongolian structure in a very natural way. An excellent choice!
1,questions previous rating,"My SP 1604 N in a 2004 compaq Computer has worked fine for eight years. It is now warning me that it is about to fail. On start up it hangs at start and I have to punch F 2 to get it going. I was going to order this exact replacement but the review sounds awful. I have to do something and internal hard drives are not available at WalleyWorld or RS in my town. Guess I will have to go ahead and order this one and take my chances. I have already had to reload from scratch once and I hate to do it again. It takes days and days just to get programs back in and working. If I do, just watch here for my review later.Update: Order submitted Feb 26 and issued Feb 27. Tracing the shipment to the supplier went unanswered. Delivery was promised March 05 - March 20 - It is now March 27 and still nothing. After 30 days I would never use this supplier again."
4,Got my attention from page one,"The author e-mailed me from a review I had done in amazon.com, saying he thought I would enjoy his debut if I liked the Stephen Hunter novel. I figured that kind of door to door marketing and belief in one's product was just novel enough to warrent a looksee. The guy invented the start buttom for the PC, and that is way more than most accomplish in a lifetime. His writing career can be just as bright. He makes you care about the characters and the action really moves. I also liked the way everyone at Megasoft is known by their e-mail name. This was a fun read and the pages flew by."
3,Be afraid......be very afraid!,"I'm not a programmer, hacker or even someone who could author a web page, but I do understand invasion of privacy and it scares me to think that there is no way of protecting ourselves from the information age.The author emailed me and asked me to consider reading this book. I purchased the book through amazon.com and settled in to read.As an espionage-phile from way back (I remember when Ludlum was GOOD), I cannot say that this book belongs with the greats, but I did enjoy it, especially the last 1/3, where everything begins to fall into place for a riveting climax.I look forward to other Oran books...I'm sure he has more ""Megasoft"" stories to tell.In short, this is a great, light, fast summer read."
3,Perfect summer reading!,"I read the book because the author e-mailed me, (made me feel real special)! I couldn't get particularly involved with the characters..the main character seems to do a lot of dumb things,but I love ""tech talk"" ,the novel moves along quickly, and I can recommend it to my patrons in the library."
3,"I liked it - I didn't love it. OK, not great.","'Ulterior Motive' starts out suspenseful (murder, then attempted obliteration of the crime) but then coasts along from there. I found the story just too predictable - it was obvious to me who the REAL criminal mastermind was after the first couple of chapters. (I won't give it away here!) I found the techno stuff interesting in that I learned about back doors into programs. And the OneWire premise was intriguing/disturbing in a frightening sort of way. I wish Dan had done more with exploring the ""nothing is as it seems"" concept in this story and come up with three-dimensional characters; 'Ulterior Motive' would have been much more enthralling! Full disclosure: Dan emailed me and asked me to read his book. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I did, because I am willing to give just about any book a chance. I'd recommend it as a good summer vacation read!"
2,Just another Bill Gates/Microsoft based suspense novel...,"I bought this book based on the Amazon reviews. I often wonder what other books people read before they read the one they reviewed. I thought this book was average at best, and at worst I had to struggle to keep interested. The plot was the same as ten other novels, the story was so over-explained as to be ridiculous (this could have been a 100 page novel and still got its point across). I will say that the action is well written, so I suspect that consequent novels will be better conceived/written. Its a quick read, but nothing will stick in your head past the last page."
4,Excellent source for scuba divers around the Pacific NW,"This book is a must for any scuba diver venturing into the waters of Puget Sound, coastal British Columbia and Vancouver Island. It was a great resource during a recent 4 day diving trip to Barkley Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island. It provided us with hours of conversation about what we had seen and what to look for next."
5,works well!,My husband uses DocQlace for chronic constipation and it works better than anything else that he has tried. I recommend it.
5,Great to have!,I have been riding my motorcycle now for over 35 years and found it to be a pain to stop and dig out a map to see where I went wrong. This handy little item is a necessity for anyone traveling on a motorcycle. I used the top half to display a folded area of the map and the bottom to display the turn by turn directions. Works great!
1,Insufficient explanation makes this impossible to use,"There are a lot of excercises in this book, but they seem a strange eclectic choice. But who knows as there is a short explanation at the beginning of each chapter, but this is not enough to get the concepts over in a clear manner. The print is very big too!So thats the problem, the material may be very good but it is ruined by badly edited explanatory material. The catchy chapter titles (what on earth is a ""Cookie Cutter""?) do not make up for the complete lack of decent, relevant tutorial information.And then there's the CD - its not linked into the book at all. I assume its supposed to be to give you some material to play over in given keys but its hard to tell - some chord charts might have been useful (or have I missed the point, who knows?). Some interesting music might have been nice too.Sorry... must do better. Look elsewhere."
4,an elequently told story,"I don't think any single book can broach all of the facets of dying, death, and grieving; but for children facing the prolonged terminal illness of a loved one, this book can be a very useful tool for parents or caregivers in engaging a child in a conversation about their feelings about the dying process. The butterfly is one of the most used images to talk about death and it is very well used here."
3,Not very informative.,"The shots are nice enough and Sweet certainly has his technique down pat. However, I really learned nothing from the book.Perhaps I was expecting too much. I've been a serious photographer for nearly 40 years. Not to pat myself on the back, but I know the basics as well as anyone and was hoping for a bit of insight into Sweet's reasons for making certain shots.All this book provides is an explanation of what equipment was used. If you're into using filters for every shot you might learn something here.I think that the money would be better spent on one of John Shaw's books. ""Focus on Nature"" comes to mind as Shaw really explains his thinking behind each photo and doesn't just list the equipment that he used to make it."
4,"Nice Photos, Short on Instruction","Sweet's book is basically a portfolio of about 50 images, with camera, lens, filter, and exposure information.The photos are great, but the explanations that go with them are fairly terse and could provide more instruction."
5,Beautiful Book!,"Tony Sweet's photographs are breathtaking! As you look at each photo and associated rationale for how and why he chose a particular exposure or composed it in a certain way, you realize the keen awareness he has of his environment and the obvious care and patience he places in his work. I am so glad that he shares the technical side to his wonderful work. I think photographers of all levels will have much to gain by reading and studying this book!"
4,"Lovely book, but repetitive.",Nice book. Just not super substantive. He has a style of using about 4-6 approaches to nature landscapes and sticks with them so it's repetitive.
4,Nice summary of Sun style Tai chi,"In this video tape Dr. Paul Lam teaches 12 movements of Sun style (Commencing form, opening and closing hands, single wip, wave hands, opening and closing hands, brush knee, playing the lute, parry and punch, repulse monkey, push the mountain, opening and closing hands, close). It is very easy to follow. Dr. Lam first demonstrates the movement, then it teaches it to a student/instructor, then they demonstrate it together (one facing front and the other back), then the student/instructor performs the movement, and finally a group of students demonstrates the movement together with the previous learnt ones. At the end Dr. Lam demonstrates the set from the front and the back view. A qigong excercise follows. The video also includes warming up excercises. Almost all of the students are elder people, however the set is beautiful and can be practised by younger people as well. What I didn't like was the quality of the production."
3,Good excecise but not easy to follow,"This is my first Tai Chi video so I have nothing to compare with. Overall, I liked the excercies and I liked how he broke every move into multiple segments to make sure the viewers get it. But his explaination of each move is not very clear and sometimes lacks details. For example, he should point out when a movement requires shifting weight or bending knees. These details are ommitted from time to time. He also needs to incorporate more breathing instructions into the movements. I was able to follow it, but my mom (whom I bought the DVD for) was confused by the instructions."
3,Sifu Sensi's Opinion,"Not a review, a need. How can I purchase this or other videos when I do not own a credit card. To old and to risky for a cancer survivor. but I am the ceo of a cancer non profit org. EIN 33-0782388 sponsored by American Cancer Society and tapes for Tai Chi are useful to my group, Inland Empire Nu Voices in Riverside, Calif. How may I purchase these videos from you is the main question. reviews of which will follow at a later date...I am retired MA and need update on Tai Chi For Seniors, I quit the arts 22 years ago.."
4,I have really enjoyed this Video very much!,I am pleased with my video on Tai Chi for Arthritis I bought throught Amazon and how fast I got it to my house. It is well worth the money.
3,Single disc product,"This product does not contain the most recent warmup movements that are approved by the Arthritis Foundation. It also does not contain the full scope of Tai Chi movements, left and right."
4,Choose your language,"He teaches step by step, from the front and from the back, and adds warm-up and qi gong exercises. The video is well-conceived.I find Dr. Lam's Chinese/Australian accented English a bit hard to follow, so I use the beautiful French track."
5,Getting Fit,"Since arthritis hit me hard a year ago, I have been looking for ways to improve my health, I am hoping that Tai Chi will be the start of a better me."
4,"Easy to follow, Easy to do",I really liked this tape. I found the techniques in this video extremely well demonstrated and easy to follow. The heavy use of experienced students in the demonstrations with Dr. Lam give taichi beginners a more realistic goal to aim for than many similar tapes.I have had multiple orthopedic surgeries and tried other taichi tapes but ended up with knee pain. The sequence Dr. Lam has worked out seems to avoid that problem. I actually found the warm up exercises more challenging than the taichi exercises. I solved that by simply limiting the number of reps and extent of motion.
2,So-so,"There is quite a bit of extraneous informational/promotional material at the start of the DVD. I was not interested in being told at length about the history and value of Tai Chi, I just wanted to learn how to do it.I gave this two stars because the instructors broke a basic rule for teaching any kind of physical movement: they started their teaching of each position while facing the camera, thereby forcing the viewer to try to learn by mirror image. They did break the positions down into steps and slowed them down, but as someone new to Tai Chi I still found it nearly impossible to follow along with a mirror image. Eventually the teachers turned around, but at that point they demonstrated the move at regular speed, assuming you had already mastered it. Which I hadn't. Not an insurmountable problem for the basic positions, but when they moved on to the advanced ones I gave up. And I'm not new to learning steps or positions, having had 20-plus years of dance lessons."
5,Superior Directions for Tai Chi for Arthritis,"This DVD explains the benefits of ""Tai Chi for Arthritis"" and takes you through opening exercises and twelve movements, closing with exercises. Everything is well explained and well shown in sequences."
3,Tai Chi for Arthritis,"Video quality could be a lot better. Would be nice if host spoke better english. Needs better reverse instruction. The on screen right is the viewers left, it gets confusing."
3,"Well, I didn't get into it...","I like chillout music. I've got over 50 discs of it. All I can say is this didn't really tickle my fancy. Here's why:1. I didn't like the music (but you might, of course).2. The discs are gimicky. (Read other reviewer's comments about including your voicemail messages...)3. Not everything is mixed, let alone mixed well. I like my chill to be continuous. Disc 2 here isn't mixed at all.4. The discs aren't full. Not to nitpick, but if you have two 50-minute CDs with a bit of crud on them, you could really make it a single 80-minute disc. If I get two CDs, I expect at least 60 min/disc, and probably 70+.5. There is better stuff out there. The MoS ""Chillout Session"" series is better than this. The Euphoria chillouts are better than this. Ultra, Radikal, and UBL have better stuff than this. Heck, even Deca and Beechwood have better stuff than this.Can you tell I'm disappointed? I like Paul Okenfold and Perfecto, but this is a letdown..."
5,If you can't make it yourself!,This tastes like old time home brewed root beer. It is the best and I have tested many brands. Drink it plain or OMF with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
2,Cheap and bad,"The holster itself is ok quality, however the holsters are tiny and could only hold a 1:2 scale gun. I have two normal sized airsoft guns i tried to fit in but it wasn't even close. Would not recommend."
2,"Promises much, delivers little","What fantasy fan wouldn't be attracted such beautiful cover art, the promise of a story not only about dragons, but told entirely from the 1st-person perspective of a dragon, from hatching onward? Buy it and read it, however, and you'll find paper-thin characters and a plot of uneven speed -- years occur in paragraphs with mighty happenings referred to in passing, while other brief periods in AuRon's life are written over chapters with long descriptions and yet fail to bring the characters to life. In places, E E Knight falls prey to the sin of describing the action (he was very tired) instead of writing it (on the 17th day of the journey, no water was in sight).A very good concept, executed middling-well. One of the few series starters I've read for which I have no desire to read the 2nd installment."
3,very slow developing story,"I found myself flipping through many pages of, to me, unnecessary descriptions, plot lines, dialogue, etc. Auron is a dragon who has no qualms about killing and eating ""hominids"", including humans, although that may change in future books. He does change from a young, self absorbed dragon into a more mature and thoughtful entity as he becomes an adult. I'm not sure if I will buy the next book, still thinking it over.Actually, he did ""adopt"" an orphan human girl, whom he took care of for many years and loved. He meets her again many years later, along with a dwarf whom he also befriended, and even managed to make life a lot better for the ""blighters"", a sort of ape like hominid. He also manages to avert a disastrous war of extermination by a human who wants the earth to be populated only by humans. In doing so, he also manages to free captive dragons used in the war and rescue females and their egg clutches. All in all - a fair story if you are really a dragon person."
2,An utterly dissappointing book.,I picked up this book with extremely high hopes. Finally a story with a dragon as the lead character. I was in for a huge disappointment. Auron the dragon is an evil dragon who's only thoughts are for himself and wanting to kill his brother. I found myself identifying more with his brother than with him. True the book does create a very complex story and background which would have been great...if the main character of the story wasn't truly evil and if the dragons were more dragonlike.
4,Good all around book,"I have read the first three books in the series, and the only one I would say I enjoyed is the first. 4 stars for this, 3 for the next two. Dragon champion was better because the main character felt more driven and intelligent. His story is in depth, detailed and I enjoyed the antagonist. On top of that, the fact that he is born with a weakness forced him to adapt, making him even better. The premise itself was very good. Reading a book from the perspective of a dragon was awesome, and I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the story. I would recomend this one, and might read it again if I ever have some time to kill."
3,Just Ok.,"This one is a 2.5 for me, rounded up instead of down because of the quality of the prose. The ending of this book is deplorable. Thrown together like the author had an important engagement and was getting brow beaten by his wife to get in the shower. I would have my kids read this though, as it is far better than Riordan's fill-in-the-hero templates or garbage like The Dragons of Deltora series. Don't know if I'll pick up the 2nd in the series or not. Right now I'm reading Abercrombie's latest, Red Country. I dread the day I finish it and have to go back to searching for a good read while George RR Martin finishes the next in the Song of Ice & Fire."
5,I dare you!,"I'm not big into epic fantasy, though I loved Robin Hobb's Mad Ship trilogy and a few others. I picked up Dragon Champion because I had seen it several times on my way to another shelf to pick up my usual fare of dark/urban fantasies and paranormal thrillers. I opened it, planning to satisfy my curiosity and put it back, but it was not to be.This dragon snatched me into his world so easily I didn't realize it had happened till two hours later when I came to myself, sitting on the floor under the shelf from which I'd taken the book. Dragon Champion is a fierce, haunting tale of terrible loss, self-sacrifice and heroism. The end gave me goosebumps and brought tears to my eyes. There is so much I love about this book I dare not share it here and spoil your enjoyment. So, go pick it up...I dare you to read the first few pages and put it back on the shelf.....I dare you!"
3,"not bad, not great, but fun","While i loved the ideas behind and underlying this book, it really isn't great High Fantasy. The story can be slow and the writing lackluster, the dragons are boringly human in how they think (even though they seem to consider humans primitive and have trouble understanding them, contradictorily). Plot devices are heavily relied upon, and the climax falls around a rather depthless late-in-the-game unexplored antagonist. It's written out s if it's strongly intended to be one coherent tale, while it reads more like the ""various disjointed misadventures of a human-brained lizard."" Don't get me wrong though, while it's neither epic or gripping, it is a fun read the world and setting is interesting, and it's a quick, fun read. It's not great, I'd be hard-pressed to even say it's good, but it was enjoyable enough to convince me to buy and read it's sequels (none of which are any better, but are equally fun to read)"
2,"Entertaining, but not for those looking for high-quality fantasy","This book was recommended to me after I mentioned reading/loving Robin Hobb, so I guess I was expecting it to be the same level of depth and quality. Sadly, it was not. The characters are mostly surface, with a few (unsuccessful) attempts to deepen them, and every challenge the protagonist faces is somehow miraculously (and unbelievably) dealt with in a snap. Still a somewhat entertaining read, though, if you like dragons - there were a few new ideas regarding dragon biology/behaviour that made it worth exploring."
4,Very original,"These books are good. 1 and 2 are both good. I got side tracked and will have to read the rest someday.I love the story from the view of the dragon. It's very original. Too many fantasy books are almost cookie cutter, I've never seen one like this.It's no George RR Martin but it is well written.Definitely a fantasy readers must read."
3,So So,"While a big fan of Knight's ""Vampire Earth"" series, I wanted to try his ""Age of Fire"" books and after reading the first, found it to be less than engaging. Not sure if I want to waste time on the rest."
4,A practical look at Peace,"If you are interested in looking at new ways that your congregation can promote justice and peace, this is a very helpful book. The ideas of Shalom and true peace is looked at quite closely in this book. While this was written for the UCC's transition to a just peace stance, this could easily fit other faith traditions. This also includes study questions if one would like to use it in a study setting."
2,Device suffers from interference.,"The device will not work with a 2.4 GHz cordless phone and may not work in general as a result of susceptibility to 2.4 GHz signals emanating from wireless routers, etc. Cardo technical support is no help."
3,"Pretty good, but I wish there were better books available","First, note that this is a book about creating game art for 3D games--that's all. For some reason the game books seem to have a surplus of reviews from frustrated users who didn't seem to notice what the book was about, or that a book with many detailed tutorials ""didn't tell them how to do it.""That said, I'd say this book is adequate, but not great. There's a shortage of books specifically about creating art for 3D games, and the first 150 pages are informative and well written. Unfortunately the next 150 pages are about Genesis3D, an Open Source engine that doesn't look as if it's really going anywhere, according to the URL's supplied by the book. The book does cover such topics as creating and managing textures, game interface art, and some level design. Pick up a used copy if you can."
2,A Gamer,"When I got this book I was like WOW! This Is good.But after Iread It 3 times and did what It said I was very disaponted!It said what a game shoud be but not how to do it!It only does a few short lines of That.If you want two completely copy Doom Get this Book,If not,Don't."
4,Appliance water filter!!,"This product was exactly as advertised with the exception of the type of hook-up offered. The price was super, checked all over and you could not beat the deal Waterboy gives on these quality filters.....delivery on time and without problems.....in the future I would not order the quick disconnect, my plumber does not like them and says if the connection is moved much they will leak.....hopefully these will not. Otherwise I will definitely do business with Waterboy again!!RP345"
4,Financial Independence by Eddie Solomon,This book cuts through the bull.I've read many books on this subject and this book stands out as the best of the bunch.I highly recommend this book to any one who truly wants to begin to understand the true way of financial independence.
4,AN EXCELLENT FINANCIAL GUIDE AND A MUST READ,"EASY TO READ, FOLLOW, AND UNDERSTAND. FULL OF INFORMATION FOUND NO WHERE ELSE."
5,i bought the book,"oh my god!simple to read-laymans terms!full of good information!cant wait to work for an off shore company,and soon own my own bank!thank you Eddie!"
1,Dog Tricks Volume 2,Big disappointment. I wish I could get my money back. These DVDs show trained dogs doing tricks but if you have an untrained dog you would do much better with something like the Bow Wow series by Virginia Broitman and Sherri Lippman.
4,Was Shakespeare A Sellout?,"Some people believe that William Shakespeare was so influenced by his Christianity audience that he would purposely write indeed for their likings. I didn't believe this at first but after reading this book, things changed for me. This book goes into detail on how Shakespeare was Christian or at least wrote in Christian to grasp the awareness of his audience. By reading this book, you will come to understand and ponder about ""If Shakespeare Was Writing on His Beliefs or Was He Just Another Sellout?"" This book, being under 200 pages can be understood and enjoyed by everybody."
3,Cut version,"I have this movie on VHS tape from a movie channel, and this DVD edition has been cut. It's a fun swashbuckling film, but I was disappointed that the movie was edited."
5,Now that's what I'm talking about !!!,"I bought this last week at Sam's, and am AMAZED at the picture, esp. the HD. After taking back a Vizio piece of crap, this is more like it. I installed it in my basement family room, and it doubles as the computer monitor. My ONLY regret is that they didnt have another one for our bedroom !!!"
1,"Great TV...at first, then...big problems!","After 10 months of perfect viewing, this tv developed bugs. First, upon start-up the image would be blk/wht and only cycling the power would return the color. Then 2.5 months later, right when warranty ended, no sound upon start-up, too-bright image, a glitch, then sound comes on but image is blk/wht. After 4 min, the image returns to normal.Philips tv's have quality issues. Do a search on youtube or google and you'll find many other unhappy Philips consumers."
4,Accounting Student,The item arrived quickly and in good physical condition. My local bookstore carried Vol 1 but not 2 even though we were using the same book for the next level class. While my book was not new it was in very good condition-only a few marks and notes from previous student.
2,Disappointed,"I was not disappointed with the films, just the quality. The lip sync was out in each of these shorts...the audio preceded the video. Very annoying. In no way were these ""digitally remastered"" of course, they did not promote this on their packaging. It sure needed it. I've seen this collection at a much cheaper price and if I were you, that's the one to buy. I feel taken."
3,"I trust Source Naturals, but lots of interactions with medications.","I ended up not even trying the tablets because of the interaction with medication warning on the side of the bottle. However, I give Source Naturals a lot of credit for putting the warning on the bottle, many supplement companies do not. I would trust Source Naturals as a great resource for supplements because of the honest labeling."
4,Good Film,"This film is spooky without making you afraid to turn off the lights. Jesse Hacket hates his teacher Mrs. Fink and wants to get even with her. He purchases an ancient doll. The doll changes and begins to take over Mrs. Fink's life. This film is engrossing, but it's also sometimes slow. Recommended highly."
5,Very unique,"These dessert plates will be the talk of your guests. They are flat, heavy and classy. I have other forks as I find the forks too small but if you want a dessert plate to show off your cooking .... this is it!!!"
2,When your cable has been shut off...,"...you rent movies. Sometimes you let your boyfriend pick one out. He felt pretty bad about this one, at first, but I reassured him I was thoroughly enjoying it, only lamenting that we had not altered our consciousness beforehand. This movie is SO BAD that it's hilarious...I don't think many Mexicans were actually involved in the making of this film, and it's a miracle that it was actually made into a film. Actually quite fast paced, but really as silly as can be. Bring your own brownies."
2,MEXICAN BLOWED!,This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Acting sucked. Story line sucked. A waste of time. Sorry to give a bad review!
3,Some behind the scene info..,"Ok, Blow isn't the best movie I have seen so far. But if you know how this film was made you will understand why it hasn't become a blockbuster. The movie was made for like $ 150.000,= or so, which is nothing. Director Will Harper took is crew in busses to Mexico and, guerilla style, started shooting. Asking locals to cooperate. There wasn't enough money for stuntmen, so Will himself did some of them, which he'd better not done. There is a scene were all hell breaks loose and there is one big explosion where that Vincent guy flies through your screen. In fact that is the director, crying from pain, because the mechanism that launched him shred his Achilles tendon. It took him 2 years to recover... So, yes this a B-movie, but with this info in mind it's worth to have a look at it... ;-)(no I wasn't involved in this movie!)"
4,Fixin' To Be Texan,"Enjoyed reading this humorous manual of how to become a Texan. Easy reading, some special insights into Texan's habits. Helpful to know about the weather problems and scary insects."
5,"So true, so true!","I chuckled all the way through this book as I was eatin' my chicken-fried steak, swiggin' a beer and swattin' at one of them big, flyin' cockroaches. Helen knows all of us a little too well, and she's the only one I know with bigger hair than I got. If you don't like this book, well...yawn yoan."
2,Don't Bother,"A friend told me about two shave creams, Brave Soldier and Lab Series. Brave Soldier is awful---doesn't lather at all; very messy; a waste of money for a rather smallish tube, and it just clumps and clumps. It is even difficult to wash out of the sink or tub. Forget this garbage. However, I highly recommend Lab Series shave cream...absolutely the best I ever used. But a caution: Remember, these are not like the foaming shave creams, so you need to use a larger quantity of the product....I often use the Lab Series as a base and add the canned shave cream to it. But as for Brave Soldier, take my advice and do not buy it or you will definitely waste your money."
4,Brave Soldier Shaving Cream,Very good product. I've made two orders for a total of three. This product is extra good if you use a pre-treatment of King of Shaves shaving oil. Of course nothing works if the blade isn't sharp. I like to use Gillette Fusion blades even though they are expensive.
3,Pleased with the book,"I thought that Locked Inside by Nancy Werlin was a overall good book. I found that it kept my attention good. I do have to say that it is at sometimes a little boring. In the beginning they spend most the time describing Marnie, who is the main character, I think that this helps to a point but they got a little carried away when they started to go into describing the computer game, and all of Marnie's bad habits. Then in the middle of the book it was really interesting and that kept me wanting to read more, but then again at the end they got into describing to much. I think I would probally recommened this to someone depending on their reading levels."
4,Fast paced and complex,"Werlin always puts a twist in her stories - just when you think you might have figured it out, she blows you away with the cleverness of the plot. In Locked Inside, a wealthy girl with few authority figures or lessons in trust has to learn some major life. Brainy Marnie has become a loner, finding a niche for herself in the world of Internet gaming, where she can be both anonymous and well known, powerful, and in control.When she is kidnapped (her mother was famous and left her a lot of money) someone from her gaming community sets out to rescue her. This remains far from a damsel in distress type book. Fast paced with complex issues and detailed characterization, this is a not to miss pyschological thriller. I have to admit, it took second reading to warm up to the character (unlike Werlin's Edgar Award winning masterpiece the Killer's Cousin) but it was a worthwhile read."
4,Locked Inside,"Locked Inside was an awesome book I would say. If I had to compare it to another book which I read over the summer, Catcher In the Rye I'd say ""Catcher"" and Locked Inside are two totaly different books. Catcher in the Rye is told in first person and Locked Inside is told by a narator. I, myself can relate to Locked Inside more, because I'm a computer geek just like Marnie was and I too get carried away in games and chatting.On the downside, it would have been better, had it more detail in Marnies and The Elfs thoughts. If you like a story that keeps you on your toes Locked Inside is an excelent book to read."
1,Threw it in the trash where it belongs,I read this book after finding a copy at work. I am so glad that I didn't have to pay for this book. This was one of the worst books I have read. No point in even picking it up. When I finished I threw it in the trash and will never recommend it to anyone. I hope to just forget that I read it all. The author needs to pick one of the two stories and go with it (meaning the gamer Llewellen or Marnie) I thought the gaming aspect was very cheesy. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!!! The only good thing about reading this book is that I did it at work and got paid for it.
2,THIS BOOK LET ME DOWN!,"Ok, you guys. As I have stated, this book let me down! It practically ends on page 195, and there's still 65 pages to go! My advice-Don't even start it. Also, I tried The Killer's Cousin. I wasn't pleased with that, either. So, my conclusion: If you're looking for a good read, don't expect Nanxy Werlin to fulfill your needs. If you need good, suspenseful stories, try Lois Duncan or Caroline B. Cooney! One great, outstanding, wonderful book: Swimmer-Graham Masterton."
4,the perils of having an attitude,"This is a really good read. The development of the main character is fascinating and very realistic. There are a couple of twists of the plot that stretch credibility, but those are easily overlooked in the general excitement."
4,Overall pleased with the book,"I think that Locked Inside by Nancy Werlin was an overall good book. I feel that it kept my attention pretty good. I do feel however that at sometimes in the book it got a little boring. They spent a lot of time in the beginning and the end describing the character and what was happening to her emotionally and physically. During the middle of the book it got REALLY good because it was when Marnie, the main character, was being kidnapped and everything that happened to her while she was in there so that was really interesting. I think that I would recommend this to someone depending on their reading level because people with high reading levels would most likely find the book boring."
3,PP and M do not hold up well in the new century...,"I was a fan from the beginning, but over the decades I think this trio's work has seemed more dated than that of their rivals, The Kingston Trio, The Chad Mitchell Trio, The Highwaymen, and Jim and Jean. Maybe it is the too-frequent and too-familiar reunions on PBS that bothers me. This album is memorable only for the two Dylan songs, ""Don't Think Twice"" and ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and yet the latter song has become annoying to me in recent years. Read the review below by ""J in Boston"" who complains about the price for these CD transfers of the original LP's, and also protests the lack of Mary Travers' later solo albums on compact disc. He is right on both counts. Neither Peter nor Paul's later solo efforts were memorable, but Mary had at least two releases which were superb."
2,Flat Base?,"I have other products by Best Manufacturers and have been quite happy with them so far. However, this pastry blender has not quite lived up to the name. I like the handle and long upright position but the the flat bottom has only hindered my success in adequately cutting fat into the dry mixture. In a round bowl the cutting blades don't fully make contact with the surface, leaving butter somewhat untouched and sometimes taking some pretty deep gouges out of the bowl surface. If the bottom had a more rounded cutting area this would be the perfect product for me. Until then, I am going to need to look somewhere else."
