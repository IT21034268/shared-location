4,Nambe Moon 8x10 frame,"frame looks very nice, simple but elegant. You can put your picture horizontally or vertically. I placed 8x10 picture and there was some place left in a frame, and it created very nice look. I purchased it as a gift from our department for a manager who took another position in company, and she liked it, as well as my coworkers. You can create engraving in a foundation."
1,he's full of it,"after meditating and studying the art of meditation, I found this book to be no help at all,unless you have a sleeping problem.Then I would reccomend it to all insomniacs."
1,Don't waste your time on this one.,Don't wast your time or money on this one. Order the first Highwaymen video. The quality and the sound of this one is horrible.. They all look as if they haven't slept in days and sing like it too. Johnnie doesn't sing as much on this one as the first one. The first video is just excellent...Buy that one!!! I love these guys. What happened to this video? IT IS THE PITS...
3,Highwaymen Live,"I have waited for years for the original Highwaymen Live concert to be released on DVD. Well it is on DVD...www.tracsnz.comJust search for ""highwaymen"" and you will see it there. Incidentally, this is the ONLY place online I can find it."
2,Buyer Beware Can't View on USA DVD players,I was very disappointed to find out that this DVD is not formatted to play on an DVD machines that are sold in the US. I purchased this for my mother and after receiving it we found out it was DVD 9 format. DVD players in the US need to have a DVD 1 or DVD global format. We are very disappointed that she can only watch it on the small screen on her computer. I had to pay way too much ($50) for a DVD that cannot be viewed properly.
2,Take the Money and run...,"The production of this DVD is so poor that I am amazed thatfour superstars would let such a piece out of the door. I wasvery disappointed in the quality of the sound and the fact thatthe four stood on stage and pretended to play. Its almost as ifthey had to meet some deadline to produce, or perhaps had a taxbill or mortgage payment to make.I must say if you like to hear Johnny Cash sing, its worth alook. Willie Nelson crushes his pieces too. KK, what were youthinking? Go to eBay and you will see my copy up for sale...Don't pay full price for this one - sorry - call me odd ballif you like..."
5,What can I say?,"Got goose bumps - I mean Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings & Kris Kristofferson? Thought I'd died & gone to Heaven... The video - incredible + the Lovely June Carter Cash makes a comment. A treat in it's self."
3,Racism and Forbidden Love,"This is a good movie but not a great one. It is certainly worth watching because for its time, like The Searchers with John Wayne, it addresses racism in the old west. Burt Lancaster is his usual stellar self as the older brother and leader of the family. Doug McClure is their too as the young brother as is Audy Murphy as the hot headed jerk of the family. Audry Hepburn is the sister that ends up being an adopted indian child who has grown up with the family not knowing of her true past and true people. Then a strange old man comes and bust her out about her real identity. This not only causes the locals, who hate ""injuns"" to come down on the family but it also causes the local natives to come to reclaim their child and sister. Their is a lot of fine action in this film and it is a good western and beautifully shot. I like it cause it is different in that it does tackle the racism issue but there is something missing. Good but not great."
1,Aweful,"This was an utterly terrible movie. A complete failure. The begining was boring, and the end had a slaughterfest of pointless killings. I walked away from this thinking what a bad movie. Do yourself a favor and watch The Godfather instead."
5,The Best Western Of All Time.,"I own them all. This is the best one. It has it all. Endless conflicts between decent people, romance, and love triumphs in the end. The film is a classic tragedy where every player has 'right' on their side.She's Indian, he's white. Theyre in love. His father stole her from her people, her brother wants her back. The whites hate her for causing problems, the Indians hate him for causing problems."
4,Humminbird Marine Radio,"I keep this on board my Boston Whaler in case of an emergency. I don't go too far from out so I do't need a very long range radio. Hope I never have to use it, but it adds a feeling of security."
1,This DVD isn't relevant at all and never was.,"I'm sure CHB is upset because his gravy train has been disrailed, but the truth is this curse was always something the media loved to bring up instead of talking about racist owners and bad baseball decisions.Except for Dan's relatives saying how you should buy this DVD, this story is due to hit the bargain bin anyday now. The Dollar Store will have it too.I'm sorry Dan. Now you are really going to have to work to write your column."
1,NDB got it right,"Someone named ""NDB"" (and I'm willing to bet a princely sum of money that he goes by ""NDBoston"" in certain other online venues...ahem) hit it right on the head. There is no curse. There never was. Glad that the phantasm of a curse managed to put Dan Shaughnessy's kids through college OK, but the Red Sox have had damned good reasons why they've lost over the years, and none of them has to do with ghosts, specters, curses or other figments of the imagination.None of which takes away from the unbridled joy that we all feel in Red Sox Nation at this wonderful, beautiful championship.(By the way, NDB, Shank is still gonna prime that pump. Check this site for enthralling details of the windy-titled ""Legend of the Curse of the Bambino,"" due to hit stores in May, and deep-discount racks in July or August at the latest.)"
4,Not very complete...,"I watched carefully the part of the interview with Glenn Stout, autor of the wonderful book ""Red Sox Century"".In that book Stout explained very well all the stuff of the Ruth's sale to the Yanks. But in the DVD, Stout explained little... it seems like that he was reserving stuff only for his already published book."
1,Dan Shaunessey is a putz,"I'm sick of DS making a ton of money off making us Sox fans look like miserable morons. This movie is way to over the top, and focus' on all things negative. C'mon, we're better than that. The sox have alway been competitive, and us sox fans have had many great players to watch & many exciting playoffs to watch. Our time is soon."
5,good expensive on hold device,these onhold machines are easy to use and easy to install messages to. we use strictly the sd ram attachement so we can mail the same message to 6 branchs.
4,Works and easy to use,"Works great, have owned one of these for over a year and decided to get a second one when the on-hold cd player in my other office broke."
5,An extraordinary sonic fantasy,"An astonishing work, created in the late 50s and in STEREOFor all those who are interested in sound engineering and haven't discovered Joe Meek then this is a challenging introduction.Basically it's a home studio recording of Mr Meek space fantasy CONCEPT album, him being famous of course for producing 'Telstar' by The Tornados a major hit in the early 60s.The recording methods used broke all the rules and created a unique sonic lanscape that in the main still sounds fresh and exciting fifty years on. recommended"
2,But Is It Music?,"Not really. For Generation Gauche, a robot is sufficient. For myself, I need the human factor. I know this is hard for children to conceive, but actual instruments are the mark of a performance. Consider: Gibby Haynes uses ""Gibbytronix"" to enhance the experience. It is never, ever to be seen as the experience itself. Techno is like disco, but the latter had heart, and real human beings; and horrible, horrible fashions. Yet, THEY BOTH SUCK!!!!! Hye, I got your d.j. right here!!!!! Meek had his moments, but as an artist he was well-named. If this has infuriated you, Generation Gauche, read my review of Heinz; not Teresa, not the catsup. Just Heinz. In my view, there is only two people who get by with using a single moniker: Jesus and Jordan."
1,Hack story. Go elsewhere.,"Hey, what's big right now? Fullmetal Alchemist and Bleach. I gotta great idea, lets mix the two together and throw a new name on it.That's basicaly the whole idea behind this show. Though it rips A LOT more from Bleach than it does FMA, the show is a very poor attempt to capatilize on the two series. For those looking for something with the same heart and soul as Rouroni Kenshin you will not find it here. Weak character deveolpment and even weaker narrative. While I'm not a huge fan of either Bleach or Fullmetal Alchemist, I willingly endorse both shows as a better option than this, ""pokemon"", version of the two better written and animated shows."
4,Helps me keep my game sharp,"I much prefer to play with friends, but the Pro Bridge 610 is a pretty good way to play and getter better atthe game. The button layout takes some getting used to, but the screen is big, and has lighting."
3,This is not my cup of tea(or in this case poison),"The msuic here sounds incredibly dated now, and not at all timeless, but at least Toni sings s=no jazz standards here liek she seems to be doing a lot lately, if you want to hear toni in her element then this si the cd to buy."
2,I bought this Cd for one song and that one is all I really like all that well,There are a few songs I like but many are remakes of songs from other artists. I am disappointed. I would not suggest anyone buying it.
3,It was OK,"I love the Carpenters, but this Cd has some tracks that for me had too much instrumental in the foreground that drowned out the singer. To me it was not balanced well enough to hear Toni's voice and words of song-on some of songs."
3,Need to Hear More,"Hello, and thank you for your time.It's really hard to get the gist of the song,with such a small amount of it being played.I would suggest at least one (1) minute.Again, thank you for your time, and pleaseconsider it.SincerelyPreston R. Thurman"
3,Better Live,"Having seen them live years ago I was a little disappointed in the cd. On stage they were fun to watch.When I lived in Akron, they were played on 'oldies' radio all the time, now I live here in Memphis I had to go out and buy this cd in order to hear them at all.Would I recommend this cd? Yes, it's fine. Live was better!"
4,Almost the ultimate...,"This collection is well mastered, and an excellent overview of this duo's recording career. I am disappointed by the exclusion of the single ""This is Not the First Time"" (""Gentle Stranger,"" which is on the collection, was was its B-side -- the liner notes are incorrect on that), and the failure to include any tracks from their Australian-only album ""More Than Dancing"" or their ultra-rare charity single ""Tahoe Snow."" Still, it's easily the best Captain & Tennille collection out there. If you only buy one, this is the one to get!"
2,Not again.,"Well, the labels did it again. First, when they released the album ""Dream"" on cd. Their biggest hit from that album ""You never done it like that"" turned out to be a re-recorded version on the cd release.They did it again with this ""Ultimate Collection."" That being said, I love some of their other hits, especially ""The way that I want to touch you."" Luckily, the rest of the tracks are the originals. If you're looking for the original version of ""You never done it like that"", you would have to get the 20th Century Masters collection of theirs."
4,An amazing thriller,"If you think you've got it tough or you can't overcome your situation or your attitude, you need to watch this movie. This set a new standard for ""a really bad day"" while proving what a human is capable of ""one step at a time"" and ""never giving up""!"
5,Most Incredible Survvial story I've ever seen,"Most Incredible Survvial story I've ever seen. Better than Alive, 127 hours or Jack London. Not just re-enacted, but on location. imagine navigating those pillows on one leg is impossible to fathom."
5,Amazing Story of Survival,"This is based on a true story and I was literally blown away by the movie. The indomitable spirit of man to survive, the many trials and obstacles overcome while grievously injured, and the strength of character it took to just keep going are amazing. An excellent movie!!!"
2,The Archies are fine....it's just this release that's less..,"I love the Archies music. I bought this CD thinking I would get the same perfect quality I did when I bought THE ARCHIES: The Best Of, released by Cult Records, but nope, I didn't. Many of the songs are the same but the songs on this release were not remastered and in fact, the songs are actually worse in audio than originally recorded. What happened here? Some of the songs actually max out and make your speakers sound like they can't take the sound. I recommend buying THE ARCHIES: The Best Of, if you want a perfect, remastered version of THE ARCHIES."
4,beautifully made,"The seat covers were beautiful but I had to return them. They were supposed to fit my specific truck, but they didn't take into account that my seatbelt was in my seat. Would have loved to have them in my truck but it would not work :("
5,CHICO COMES OUT WITH SMOOTH GROOVES,CHICO IS VERY TALENTED AND EVERY SONG IS WORTH LISTNENING AND ENJOYING THE WHOLE ALBUM IS WORTH THE MONEY
3,Good and bad,"This book is very good at what it does cover and very bad at what it doesn't cover. It's clear it was written by a mathematician. The topics and tricks dealing with functions and graphing are great. Anyone taking a math class such as Algebra, Trig or Calculus will be helped. It doesn't cover certain important topics at all or very lightly. There is nothing on programming. Two pages are dedicated to writing your own functions with nothing on how you can use a user defined function in a formula. While the book carefully explains how to make sure if variables are defined or not there is nothing on folders which would be a great help as the scope of a variable is a folder. By organizing folders you can keep things seperated and track when variables are defined. There is nothing on units of measure which is a strong point of this machine. That would be important in say a physics or EE class. It has very little on statistics for someone in a statistics class."
4,TI-89 Graphing Calculator for Dummies Review,The book is very concise and useful to understand the operations of the TI-89 calculator. There is not much information in the book about using the programing capabilities of the calculator but focuses most of its material on graphing.
2,It's ok,"This book is of course much better than the horrible manual that comes w/the 89 (who were they kidding)...however, it could be MUCH better at showing how to imput expressions or equations. I am a math idiot...the TI89 has saved my butt (I just need to take Algebra even though I am a history major) but if you do not know EXACTLY how to enter say a radical then you are left hanging. The examples that are shown are good, but for much less complicated problems...not dealing w/indexes and exponents at the same time. Unless I've missed something. I've had to call TI tech support to teach me how to input various problems...and they were very helpful....now if they would only rewrite THEIR manual and not assume everyone is a math wizard."
1,This book sucks a--,"This is the worst hack job I have ever seen. It should really be called, TI-89 for imbecile sucker fools. The book rushes through various functions without giving a single example of anything that the user can practice. In many places not enough information is even given to do a simple task. This book is best suited to kindling for your wood stove. Winter is almost here. Be smart and get a real book that has real math exercises in it."
3,TI-89 Calculator guide,This book is OK for those new to the graphing calculator but it falls short of giving examples for some of the more advanced features of the calculator. Also there are a few typographic errors that could confuse less advanced students.
4,TI-89 for dummies,The book was helpful explaining the basics and also gave me a little confidence to read the textbook.
3,Could be better,This book was helpful. I expected a little more from this book I expected an easy and helpful read but it read like the calculators manual a lot of the more important functions of the calculator were hard to find. I needed the calculator for Statistics yet the book covered very little if any of the statistical functions of the calculator.
3,It's for dummies and nothing beyond,"For all topics explained, it does a good job but it leaves a number of issues untouched."
4,Pretty good.,Most anime fans have heard of Death note. Light yagami picks up a notebook of a death god. Now he can kill people by writing in the notebook.The dub is pretty good. It does the series justice.
5,UNDERATED ANIMATION,This show will keep you involved an in suspense the whole time you watch. I recommend getting this. I wish that Naruto would come out as fast as this show because it is up there with Death Note. I am going to keep on getting all the episodes that comes out. This is as addicting as Heroes.
4,The plot thickens,"I have read the whole Manga series and my wife didn't. We both enjoy watching the Anime together. The Anime stays faithful to the Manga story. The plot gets more complicated and interesting by 10 folds. She is really getting sucked in the story as Light & L battle wits.The enclosed mini L statue is plasticy and nothing too excited. I wouldn't buy it on its own. But for a few bucks along with the DVD, it isn't bad and L crouches happily on top of our TV. You may want to concider the regular edition without the statue.What I hate about the series is the English dubbing, which quite lame, but not bad. The extras are nothing to be excited about, so I subtracted a star for the cons I mentioned. Otherwise, it is a must buy."
3,Mello is Always #2,"Did anyone else find it extremely ironic that a huge picture of Near graces the top of the packaging for the Mello figurine? It's easily 3 times as large as poor Mello. Given the relationship between Near and Mello in the series, I can only assume that the manufacturers were feeling particularly sadistic that day.Perhaps, in the spirit of things, we should have Light's giant face featured on the packaging for L's figurine."
5,Amazing,this dvd light gets his memory back about the death note and alot of questions are answered in this dvd.
3,Overly Convoluted,The pacing at the start of this anime is fantastic. The story is interesting. I'd give the first half of this anime five stars. Then things just start to get dumb. It really should have ended with the showdown between the two main antagonists in the first half of the series.
2,"108 PC Magnetic Building Sets, Magic!","The pieces were too small for a 4 year old...also too many ""warnings""...did not give to child but am keeping it until he gets older."
3,good,"good magnits ,kids love them .I ordered these after seeing the yellow & green colors .unfortunately they came in blue/red which my son already had ."
1,SHAMELESS RIPOFF,"As another reviewer noted, these are a shameless ripoff of the much better Swiss-made GEOMAG product. These here correspond to the ""GEOMAG Pro"" sets sold over in Europe, hence the smaller size. Everything is otherwise identical to the legitimate product, except for one BIG difference: the cheaper, flaky plastics that give off a noxious odor.I'm a big fan of ""buying US"", but not when it's a ""market quality"" ripoff of a product known for having exceptional quality. I'm sending this over to GEOMAG's PR/legal people.... Shame on you, CMS Magnetics!"
2,Disappointing!,"The grandchildren and adults have enjoyed Magformers Magnetic Building toys for the past six years. They are always the go-to items for anyone visiting in our home. This year I wanted to add some more Magformers to the collection. I saw the CMS Magnetics and decided to order them based on the reviews. I would suggest that if you have ever had the Magformers do not purchase these. Children and adults will be disappointed with the comparison.The on-line tracking provided was worthless. It stated that the package was delivered Dec 19 when in fact it was delivered Dec 24. Maybe not the fault of CMS Magnets but the shipping method will be considered for future orders. Sticking with items that are eligible for Amazon Prime is best.I gave the 3 ratings because it is OK, just OK. I prefer to purchase items that kid love to play with, provides excellent learning experiences, is durable and stands the test of six years constant use instead of six minutes then forgotten."
5,Very impressed!,"I bought these for my 7-yr-old son after he'd played with a much older similar set of a family friend's. The magnetic power of these pieces is INCREDIBLE (sometimes frustrating when he is trying to keep them apart!). Very fun--he plays for hours--there are enough pieces in the 108 piece set to do quite a bit with and they are easy to take places (they travel to his sister's games for entertainment on the sidelines!). Also, I might enjoy building with these as much as my son does. I highly recommend these, but would suggest them only for older kids, due to the danger of ""losing"" pieces if pets and small kids are around. Great toy! Going to buy more so our creations can be even bigger!"
5,birthday present,This was a birthday present for my grandson. He just loves it and plays with it all the time. We practice counting all the pieces everytime we play with it. This has really helped his counting. He loves how easy it is to build things and never get tired of the set.
4,Just as listed,I love the set I just wish that it could have been double the amount for same price. No complaints on the shipper.
4,Vast improvement over Hearts of Iron I!,"I played and really like Hearts of Iron I, but hated how much time you had to spend micro-managing your economy, your colonies, and your armies. It was fun, but way too tedious.Hearts of Iron II is still a little tedious, but they made it a lot more simple to control what you do with your economy, and armies. They also improved the tradeing you can do with other countries as well.I find this new version to be a lot better, and a good and solid game to play."
3,"Production, Research,Technology,ect., ect.,","Just too much to do, to fight world war 2. The United States War College should put this in their curriculum. I like the concept but very, very, complicated to play. It is for the die hard world war 2 strategist."
3,Not Historical,If you are looking for an interesting war game you may like this one. If your looking for a historical accurate game look elsewhere.
1,Wow! this really sucks,This game is impossibly complicated. What a useless game. You are better off just watching some tv or going for a walk at the park than trying to play this abomination of micromanagement. What a waste. I want to throw up. And I wish I could have my money back. Dont buy this garbage.
3,Great game. Takes time to learn.,Plan on devoting some time to learn this game. From what I played of this game it is fun. I would recommend this seller. Received it the time promised.
4,Hearts of Iron 2,"WW II simulation, war time strategy. goes past WW II and into the cold war.Almost to indepth, slows the game play.If you are looking for technical and indepth game play this is it."
2,Very disappointing,"I got this game from my wife on X-mas. My family was excited to play it that evening. The game was excruciating to play. We are average SNL viewers having seen most episodes at some point in time (there are reruns on everyday), but the questions are TOO difficult. You would have to watch the show 12 hours a day and take detailed notes to get most of the questions right.The DVD only plays a few questions from each catagory so when you use up the questions it refers you back to the written questions. Lastly the DVD plays the same few SNL theme notes over and over again. We had to pause the game to make it stop.We returned the game the following day."
3,This game is lame,"I received this game for my birthday and was anticipating it to be a lot of fun. However, when I began playing it with my family, I discovered that most of the questions were meant for die hard snl fans. I was expecting the questions to be a lot easier to make for fun competition with anyone. I would recommend this game to anyone that is a die hard fan like me because it challenges you to remember all that useless snl trivia over the years."
2,Questions too obscure,"In order to answer the questions in this edition of Trivial Pursuit you would need an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutae of SNL. Most of the questions were beyond the ability of my family, who have watched SNL since it began, and who quote it frequently. I was very disappointed in this game."
3,LIKE A GAS STATION SELLING ESPRESSO,"I have only played this game once, but it seems to be well crafted. Most importantly, The questions are balanced enough between the obscure (sorry, Tim Kazurinsky) and the satisfying (""What cartoon song did Andy Kaufman lip synch to?""). For the impressions category, I find if I just guess ""Darryl Hammond"" 100% of the time, I am right more than 70% of the time.The DVD seems like it was included to be ""relevant"" (like a gas station selling espresso in the 90's), but it is useless other than generating some extra income for Don Pardo.In the scheme of Trivial Pursuit games this one ranks higher than most (The Beatles being the lowest on the scale with inane questions like, ""What color shoe laces did John Lennon wear while recording Abbey Road?"" Answer: ""Trick Question: He was barefoot"").The Beatles Trivial Pursuit"
3,Classic but difficult,"I do like Sly Cooper and knowing about the pattern of the game is great! The only problem with this game is dying if I get hit once, unless I have lucky charms. I mean-what the heck?! It made a lot of the levels difficult. And speaking of difficult levels, the levels in this game that do NOT work are shooting 40 treasure chests but losing if a crab steals one of them, hitting 50 chickens while dodging creepy waddling red bomb roosters, and almost every level in Clockwerk's place! This game is good but it still needs improvement!"
5,it is my favorite game,it is a fun game.you do not kill poeple.you kill things like monkies and dogs.you do not use guns.it is a realy fun game for kids.
3,The Thievius Raccoonus!,"""Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus"" is a moderately fun platformer, where players take the role of Sly Cooper (the raccoon). The story is very cartoonish and kid-oriented so this isn't a bad game for those younger gamers. But how about for everybody else?Well, ""Sly Cooper"" does have it's moments. A number of fun, platforming ""missions"", which (while doing nothing new for the genre) are usually fun to play.Although there are a number of things that are in ""Sly Cooper"" that are just downright terrible. A number of weak missions, a story only really enjoyable for younger gamers, and some difficulty issues, all hurt this game's appeal.Still, ""Sly Cooper"" can be fun, and if you are looking for a game to play with a younger gamer, this isn't a bad choice. Just keep in mind if you are older, you probably won't be a fan."
2,SLY COOPER AND THE THIEVIUS RACCOONUS,"I love the Sly Cooper Series, but I must say, this is my least favorite. The graphics are poor and getting keys get boring after a while. The most fun part is the driving games with the Cooper Getaway Van. Can't wait for Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time!"
4,cool game,"my child loves that he can be sneaky and steal stuff like keys , profiles etc....if he loves crash bandicoot and sonic he will love this"
5,Simple platforming fun.,"There's not really much to say about this game. It has a cell-shaded style (which I predict will look pretty dated in 3 to 4 years). It's your basic platformer that tosses in a few extra stealth elements to spice up the mix.Regardless, all these little 'extras' really help to keep the game's fun juices going, this makes for such a creative, diverse game. Everyone should play it."
4,best game ever!!!,"This game is sooooo awesome!!Sly is easy to move and gameplay isn't hard. i haven't gotten stuck in this game once. And, the graphics are awesome!!! I definatly recomend this game."
4,"A lot of fun, but I have a problem","I agree with everyone who liked this game. It is fun, clever, good-looking, etc. Unfortunately, it gives me motion sickness. Most games don't.I bought the game for my son, and he's fine with it. So I know it's me. (No big deal; it keeps me from hogging the controller.)I have had a similar problem with a few other games for PC, notably Castle Wolfenstein (the OLD one) and Myst III. If you don't have a tendency to motion sickness, then I recommend it."
4,fun for the whole family,"i highly recommend this game. my 2 sons ages 6 and 9 as well as myself(a mom), have all enjoyed this game. players of all skill will find this game fun and challenging. the game has a good story line and there are 3 different challenges within this game; first, to beat each level. second, to find and collect all the bottles to open the vaults in each level. and third, to beat the timers for each level. the different challenges make the game even more interesting and fun to play."
5,Great Thief Game,"Sly Cooper is about a thief who goes around and steals stuff with his buddies. The graphics were great, sound was great, gameplay was great, and story was great. You should check out Sly Cooper, it will be worth the while."
4,good but flawed,"The game itself is fun. I could live without the mini games, but fortunately they're pretty easy. Alas that is one of my two beefs with the game. I don't want impossible, but if you're going to have the game be this easy, there should be more rounds. I'm far from a master gamer and I beat this game in 2 weeks.The other problem with the game is that it's a little buggy. Every now and then it crashes... once when it was showing the movie after beating a boss but before it saved the fact that I beat it. There's also a spot in the Cunning Disguise level that you can jump into that will cause the screen to mess up. You have to restart the level to get it back.Other than that though, it was a lot of fun to play. The characters are amusing and hey, in the end... well you'll just have to find out yourself."
3,Standout Game -no room to move,"This game really stood out among the others and I rented it. One problem I had was how easily Sly dies because he really can't see far in front of him. This causes him to get taken out by dogs and arrows,etc as soon as he lands on a new platform. And when he gets hit, he's out. There's no life gauge or mascot hanging around. You have no access to firepower or any real protection. I once used an invincibility code and then the hang/swing button failed to function, so I couldn't advance. I need a game where you can relax and wander, not be on constant guard for enemies attacking you before you can even step back or defend yourself. This has kept me from trying Sly 2, but I think I will now."
1,worst platformer avilabale,if you do buy this crap it should be because you wanna burn it. the game is garbage. levels are slow paced and the game can beat in a mere 2 hours. get jak and daxter instead.
1,overated peice of garbage,who needs this game. warning unless you are 10 years old do not buy this game. just pass this one by. and get jak and daxter or rachet and clank both are much better games. do yourself a favor get out of this reveiw selection and go look up those two games.
2,Sly Cooper,This game is the gayest game ever it is for 4 year olds do not get this game it is a waste of money.
1,This game is great..........not!,THIS GAME IS GREAT!AND THE GRAPHICS........[are bad].It's 2-D!Gee...I shouldn't have even wasted energy in my FINGERS writing a review for this one.Man...[money] too...
4,Sly is great!,"This game is hard to get used to, but that's where the cons end. Thsi game is so addictive, I have beaten it twice and I still can't get off it! I mean, if you want a game that you can keep playing get this! Though don't even try the master theif sprints; they are imposible to beat. Adults, don't get me wrong, this looks like a kids game and the story line is like a kids game, but you will be playing for hours! This game rocks! Get it, and play it again and again and again!"
4,Great game,"The graphics are awsome, the gameplay is incredible, and in my opinion, this is the most underrated game. When i first bought it, i was a little skeptical, I had just bought Medal Of Honor: Frontline, Street Hoopz, and NHL 2003. And all 3 were great. That got me thinking that this game wasnt very good, oh but it was. I was amazed on how much fun the game was.... Wats not fun about stealing stuff w/ a stealth raccoon? If u like games Like Spyro (and there is a new spyro coming out on PS2) then get this game"
4,okay,"Once again on my quest for Spyro-like games, I rented this and immediatly liked it. There is a huge flaw though. You get hit, you die and it's back to the beginning! I tried to solve that with my gameshark, but for some reason that code makes a button go all crazy and it wont work. So, you can't grab hooks, you can't get to the boss w/ the mirrors top layer. If they make a Sly 2 and I am sure they will, I hope it will have a life meter! Very fun to play though as long as you don't die too much.I reccommend Ty The Tasmanian Tiger and all Spyro. This is not a kid game."
5,WHAT A GAME!!!,"It all started when I went to my friend's house. He asked if I wanted to play Sly Cooper and I answered,""Sure!"" So we started on the level when you are first introduced to enemies and bottles. I started to love it the more I played. I asked my mom if I could get it. She said ""Yes"" and I got it! Six months later,I beat the game! My Favorite part was beating the Panda King. I thought that the hardest level was when you fight the Master Mind of the Raid on the Cooper's House. I also like this game because when you get a certain amount of bottles, you'll get cool moves. My favorite move is the stun attack. This game is also very good with graphics. And Boy! It seems like I am inside Sly Cooper's body!"
2,"""dissappointing""","I'm dissappointed with this dvd. Some parts seems like ""youtube-amateur-porn-softcore""... Just save your money. If you wanna see amazing woman (real hot) just try the serie: Actiongirls."
1,A Waste of Money and Time,"I was really hoping that this book would provide new ideas, techniques, and inspiration for the use of sociodrama within work, school, and training settings. It offered very little new that has not been better covered in ""Sociodrama: Who's In Your Shoes?"" The writing is dry. The ideas are limited. If you weren't already experienced in using drama as a teaching and/or therapeutic tool, this book would not help you become skilled or knowledgable about it. I felt like I really wasted my money and my time."
4,"An interesting trip into ""What if...""","This book deals with 2nd generation members of the Manson Family and how their lives have been affected (distorted?) by Charles Manson and his brood. It's an interesting look at ""what if..."" Manson's followers rose again and somehow freed him to roam and terrorize the countryside once more. The main characters are believeable, but not sympathetic enough to really root for in this novel. I give Perry credit for some imaginative research and development with his book, however. A somewhat predictable ending help to keep this from being a really top-notch thriller."
1,fiction/exploitation at it's best!,"What if...what if Charles has been a ""drugged out hippie guru"", what if Charles had been involved, even in the slightest in the murders, what if Charles had even been in the area for the so-called ""Tate"" murders...what if Charles so called friends hadn't taken and turned on him, becoming deceitful little liar, some even hiding behind their religion that too is a lie, in my opinion)...Anyway, if these ""what if's"" even had a tiny little bit of truth to them, this book may be considered non fiction..People need to stop buying into these exploitative lies and those lies put forth by the king of lies, V. Bugliosi...Open your minds and stop being robots.Charles did not ""lead"" anyone.If anything, his only crime was trusting people and surrounding himself w/ liars who woul dsell their mother's soul for their own selfish purposes."
2,shudda read the fine print,I tried to read the specs as I didn't want an older outta date book but I failed and ended up with a eight year old version ..... makes no sense to buy a book that old when dealing with fast changing subjects..... I did check when I initially looked but slipped up.
5,A classic!!!!!!!!!,I highly recommend this book to gain greater insights in the Music business or any business. donald does it again. this is one of the only legal books on the Music industry I would recommend. It was a great buy along with a couple of manuals I purchased from Musicbrains.net entitled the Indie label Kit.
4,Buen libro.,"En conjunto con mas libros que compartan diferentes puntos de vista sobre el mismo tema este puede ser un gran comienzo para personas que esten interesadas en saber por completo como es que se maneja el dinero en el negocio de la musica.Mi fuerte no son las matematicas, y aunque tiene algunas ecuaciones que desconciertan si no se sigue un hilo sobre el tema, no impiden tener una imagen completa de como se maneja el dinero y las cuestiones legales.Para finalizar, el libro tiene el defecto de dar los temas incompletos, dando pie a que: se contrate a este señor que se dedica a esto o en una forma u otra asegurar el trabajo a sus colegas.Buen libro, pero no es una biblia, por favor..."
5,"DON'T Put It Off !!! ... Read it NOW, before it's too late!","... ""Listen-Up, Spuds!"" - as DEVO and Neil Young would say - and heed this advice: DON'T Put It Off !!! ... Read it NOW, before it's too late! ... Yeah, it's a HARDCOVER. ... Yeah, it's kind of COSTLY. ... Yeah, it's a BIG book with a lot of legal jargon and business mumbo-jumbo. ... TOO BAD! ... Ignore it at your own peril! ... Read this book now - NOW! - before you get in so deep into the deep water in the deep end of the pool, and don't know what happened, how to deal with it, or what you can do to get out of it without having to hire a lawyer for THOUSANDS of dollars to save you from economic ruin! ... Trust me: just buy it, read it, and make everyone else in your band read it, too! ... You will NEVER regret it - NEVER! ... Besides, Donald Passman writes like a real pro and makes it interesting and fun to read. You WILL get a number of laughs out of this book, too. It's THAT good... YOWZA! - The Aeolian Kid"
5,informed,"this book was recommended by ludacris the singer and i would like to thank him for the referrel. it is valuable information if you are interested in entering into the business of music, i purchased it for my son he is very pleased with it, thanks luda, and thanks amazon for having it"
3,Kind of cool and has some okay tips,"Has some insight about how to get put on, but not much more than I already knew about."
3,Good if you're getting signed to a major label,"A great resource for musicians who are signed to labels or hiring management, but virtually useless for most musicians, the ones who play gigs in clubs on weekends or festivals. Would have loved to read more tips on booking strategy."
3,Good for beginners,"It is a very good book for beginners. But if you are looking for more detailed and professional informaiton, then lookg for other sources. This is helpufl in giving you a broader picture and getting you to industry standards."
5,All You Need,"Like the title says, this book is a straight-forward no-nonsense guide to all you need to know about the music business. I have read it several times and I recommend it to all my clients in the entertainment industry."
4,Definitely A Get This!,"The title's got it! The Music Industry is a Business. Okay, some of us like to think it's about art, culture, the aspirations of humanity, the beauty found in a voice singing unto the Heavens. But, there's a ton of pre-packaged stuff out there that makes my grocery store look like it sells stuff only on the same day it gets them.I really enjoyed this book. It really helps lay out a plan for how to do it, and who couldn't use some help? But, I didn't think it was as strong in the whole pr area that it is in others. Another book, Guerilla PR: Wired, really came through there, especially with the 'Net--Blair Witch, remember? It's gotta help to have total strangers know who you are."
4,Practical Guide to the Music Biz,"We have been offering advise for new and upcoming musicians since 1968 at our site. We recommend the book by Mr. Passman, as well as refer those interested in purchasing said book to Amazon.com. Amazon.com really does have the best prices."
3,"""...and nothing you need to know about the future of the music business""","iTunes? CD Baby? Releasing your music online? Myspace? Pitchfolk? Nope, none of that is in here. This book is about holding onto a slightly larger piece of the pie when you negotiate with a record label for a traditional multi-album contract. This is definitely the right source for that information and is hugely respected for it. But the success of Death Cab for Cutie, Arcade Fire, Interpol, Vampire Weekend, MIA, etc. are cut from a different mold. Sure they eventually need to negotiate with the suits, but the record industry is now also about how to virally market oneself (or one's band), distribution via digital channels, and taking advantage of the ""piracy"" to gain an audience.The fact that this is the new edition makes it clear how quickly the music biz is changing. It seems dated already."
4,Music Biz,this book is very comprehensive and enjoyable. it's easy to read and i learned about some important things to watch out for in the music business. it's an excellent reading for those who are considering a career in the biz. it'll save you a lotta money hen you hire a lawyer because you'd be familiar with most of the contractual / basic rules already.
5,You can't live without this book!,"Without a doubt one of the most resourceful guides for not only aspiring musicians, but managers, producers and regular record and radio folk as well. You can't say you're interested in a career in the music industry without having this book on your shelf!"
3,"some useful information, some hype","If you aren't a musician this is more than all you need to know about the music business. If you are a musician this is nowhere near all you need to know about the music business. But most of what you need to know you learn by getting involved in the business itself, not by reading books. A large part of this book's large readership consists of wanna-and-will-never-be's, but take a look anyway. (Remember that you also need to know how to play. For that I can do no better than recommend PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns.)Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
3,Could have been better,"On the spine it says Bon Jovi One Wild Night Live 1985-2001, what a rip! Runaway and In and out of love are the only songs on the album recorded at a concert from the 80's, the rest was recorded in 1995 and 2000. You'd think Bon Jovi would use material from the Slippery When Wet and New Jersey tours since during those two tours Bon Jovi was at their peak in popularity, but instead were given tracks from the Keep the Faith and Crush tours. While most the album is good, Jon's voice is weaker then it used to be just play the first 4 albums and you'll hear what I mean. Besides many of Bon Jovi's biggest hits missing there are a couple of covers we could have done without, and songs like Someday I'll be Saturday and Just older aren't in the same league as their classics and where is Bed of Roses. I'm sure a Bon Jovi concert is a lot better than this album. They should have made a two cd set, so they could include the more essential tunes."
5,Bon Jovi still rocks you to your feet!,"This is a great album for those that may have never heard Bon Jovi live throughout the years! The band is definitely the best one I've ever seen live. The quality of their performances matches the quality of their studio albums which very rarely do you get a band that can do that. I recommend this album for anyone that wants to listen to a CD and feel like their at a concert too! Be sure to check out his other albums, they're all awesome - he's never released a bad song, and his new album is set to be released in early Oct. of this year!"
4,STILL ROCKIN AFTER TWENTY YEARS,"Though I was very young at the time, I have been a BON JOVI fan since SLIPPERY WHEN WET debuted in the 80's. Having never gotten the chance to experience a LIVE BON JOVI concert, their newest cd ONE WILD NIGHT is a fantastic way to substitute the energy. Songs like LIVIN ON A PRAYER and RUNAWAY still hold up twenty years later!! The guys are still going strong. I highly recommend this cd and cant wait until BOUNCE is released in October!!"
5,Unbelievable,"Ok I will cut to the chase. I am a diehard Joviaddict. When this cd came out I was in the store that day to purchase it. This cd sums up a live show in no uncertain terms. As Jon said about the release they wanted it to be a ""snapshot"" of what there live shows are like. The sound quality is awesome. This just goes to show that these boys from Jersey , can still wipe up the floor better then any rock band from that era. Could this be why they are still here pleasuring us all with their blend of Heartfelt music and Talent???????? All the non believers need to get with the program. By this cd....I tell you....you will believe."
3,What happened???,"Bon Jovi is one of the best live bands I have ever seen in concert, (and I have seen such mega acts as Paul McCartney, U2, Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones and Nirvana) but this album did not seem to reflect the energy and quality of the live shows I have seen the group perform. It really is not a bad album, per se, BUT it could have and should have, been better. I am REALLY looking forward to their live acoustic album coming out in the fall, because if you have not heard such classics as ""Livin' On A Prayer"" or ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" acoustically, you will be in for a treat. Let's hope they get it right with that release, and even put some covers on it as well."
4,Live music is the best,"Wow! Powerful music. The opening to ""It's my Life"" had me in tears. Anyone who grew up listening to Bon Jovi should own this CD. It's a great mix of old and new,and the fact that they're all live recordings is just that much cooler. Loved when the crowd chanted the lyrics to ""You Give Love a Bad Name"". So full of emotion and memories. There's not a bad song on here,and I'd strongly recommend this CD to anyone who considers themselves a Bon Jovi fan. Heck,even if you don't maybe it's time you start. This is good stuff."
4,"Good, but could have been better","When I first heard of this cd, I was very excited. I have been waiting for a Bon Jovi Live cd for years, living off of the live/bootleg material I downloaded on mp3. While this cd is very good, it could have been better.This cd includes some of Bon Jovi's best, ""Livin on a Prayer,"" ""You Give Love a Bad Name,"" and ""Wanted Dead or Alive,"" for example. However, it lacks such great songs as ""Always,"" ""Bed of Roses,"" and ""Tokyo Road."" For the beginning Bon Jovi fan, this cd should be enough to satisfy you, however I feel that the lacking of these songs detracts from the cd. Even though some of these ""missing"" songs were Jon Bon Jovi solo efforts, they should have been included, heck ""Rockin In the Free World"" is on this album."
1,Overdubbed Pro tools live maybe,"Song Selection was decent. A double live may be more fitting if one was trying to actually see what a Bon Jovi show is like live. The few b-sides they took sounded much better and much rawer than the over polished, redubbed many times, ""live"" versions here on the cd. Do yourself a favor and find the bootlegs for these shows and the import singles for a true Bon Jovi experence."
4,Good live CD but...,"This was a very good live CD but I just didn't care for the songs Something to believe in because of certain lryics on the song as it was sung. Also I didn't really enjoy the song I don't like monday's. But to me rest of the CD rock because it had most of the hits all on one live CD. I think if your a true Bon Jovi fan like myself, then pick this live CD up, then also buy the CD called Cross Roads which has the main hits all on one greatest hits album. Then between the live CD and the greatest hits CD you have the whole set of Bon Jovi. Then you can sit back and relax plus enjoy song after song of their music."
1,zero stars,One WEAK night!...zero stars if that was available. I never realized Bon Jovi was this bad a live band. They obviously get a LOT of production help in the studio because this album (several different concerts in several different venues) is ALL bad. Sorry for them and sorry for me for buying it.
3,Where's the hits??,"I agree with many of these reviews. This should have been a ""greatest hits live"" double-disc set with ALL the hits. The setlist should have been.DISC ONE: 1. One Wild Night 2. You Give Love A Bad Name 3. It's My Life 4. In and Out of Love 5. Always 6. Just Older 7. These Days 8. Livin' On a Prayer 9. Something For The Pain 10.Something to Believe In 11.Bed of Roses 12.Wild in the Streets 13.I Don't Like Mondays 14.Blaze of Glory 15.RunawayDISC TWO: 1. I Believe 2. Say It Isn't So 3. I'll Sleep When I'm Dead 4. Hey God 5. Tokyo Road 6. Someday I'll Be Saturday Night 7. Lay Your Hands On Me 8. Bad Medicine 9. Wanted: Dead or Alive 10.I'll Be There For You 11.Only Lonely 12.In These Arms 13.Next 100 Years 14.This Ain't a Love Song 15.Keep The FaithIf you agree with me, please press ""review helpful"" to show the best band in the world what is missing. Even if you disagree with some songs, click it just because of the point. Thank you."
5,It's About Time...,"After many, many years, and many, many performances, finally Bon Jovi has given the fans what they wanted. This live CD includes many of the band's biggest songs, as well as others that are not as well known. There are new songs, as well as old favorites and every one of the band's CDs is represented. From old favorties like ""Livin' on a Prayer"" and ""Runaway"" to ""It's My Life"" and ""Just Older,"" ""One Wild Night..."" covers everything that represents Bon Jovi. The remix of the song ""One Wild Night"" is hot and a great way to finish off this wonderful collection. The sound quality is terrific, and for those who have attended Bon Jovi concerts in the past will remember the energy and excitement of being there with this live CD. Finally...."
4,Good stuff!,"Great Music by the band after a long comeback season. Check out the wild night song, it has a crunchy beat of hip-hop too."
2,this is it?????,"Since 85 i've been a loyal fan to this band. Once i drove all night to attend to one one of their gigs and i've done so many things and spent so much money to support these guys, buying everything with the label bon jovi on it. after so many years of waiting for a live album i'm so dissapointed. I just wish that someone have had the interest to give fans something worth. I can't believe this album is out.It has a pretty bad editing, a terrible live sound, jon isn't singing at all, i mean, anyone could have done this album from their own home.one wild night 2001 is so popish that for a while i thought i was hearing ricky martin doing his stuff and besides, it ain't a live version as it says on the album sleeve. I also didn't like the sleeve work. The song selection could have been so much better. I can't imagine a bon jovi live album without ""wild in the streets"" on it but instead i have to hear at Mr. Geldof. I think Bon Jovi still owes some fans a descent effort on a live album."
3,Not very happy,"I'm pretty much the biggest Bon Jovi fan in the world, and I was so pumped about their latest release! But when I slid the cd into the player I could tell by the first track, It's My Life, that something wasn't right. I felt like I was sitting there listening to some bad boot-leg recording. I understand it's live, but when did that mean the recording had to suck? Also, some of the song selections on the album have me scratching my head. ""I Don't Like Mondays""? With all the great songs that didn't make the cut . . . ""Always"", ""Lay You Hands on Me"", ""I'll Be There For You"", etc . . . why did two cover songs make the set? True Bon Jovi fans will buy the album anyway, but I think you'll come to the same conclusion."
3,Solid...but disappointing,"I was very excited when I heard about this live album, espescially since it supposedly had performances spanning Bon Jovi's entire career. More that half of these songs are from the Crush tour, however, so not much of Bon Jovi's early days are represented. Some songs, such as Bad Medicine, actually sound more tame than the studio versions. Also, to say that there are a few songs left out would be a huge understatement. On the good side though, there are killer versions of ""Livin' on a Prayer"" and ""In and Out of Love."" ""Rockin' in the Free World"" is also a cool cover song. I recommend this album if you are a true Bon Jovi fan, because it is very good. It just should have been so much better."
5,Beautiful feeder!,"I purchased this hummingbird feeder and not only do the birds love it it looks beautiful. It has a hidden feature i like too...the base is actually a funnel, so all you do is flip it over, rotate the plug and pour. No more sticky messes trying to pour into a narrow neck!! I was super excited if you cant tell. I was curious whether the flowers not being red would affect the birds but they just swoop on in! :) great feeder. I purchased the top filling one too!"
1,Leaky Feeder,"This one's a leaker! This hummingbird feeder is very, very pretty, but has a major functional design flaw. The removable plug makes it convenient to fill the feeder. However, the plug ends up at the bottom of the feeder when the feeder is hanging, and herein lies the problem. The normal temperature variation over the course of the day (up to 20 deg difference between the high and low temp on a normal day) causes expansion and contraction of the plastic parts. This makes the plug move just enough to cause the feeder to leak. Bummer, because I really liked the way the feeder looked. It is well made otherwise, but sadly this design flaw caused my feeder to drain within ~3 days from the constant dripping (not from hummingbirds). I decided to throw out the feeder one week after I received it."
2,Hummingbirds never used it,I bought this last year and hung it up and the Hummingbirds never used it. They went to my conventional feeders instead. I thought it was pretty but I don't see a Hummingbird being able to sit and drink. The swirly part they would land on isn't positioned just right. I may give it one more chance this year but I'm not too optimistic.
3,not the best,"so far the hummers haven't embraced this feeder. the colors are not as bright as they appear in the picture. I probably wouldn't have purchased it had I know the dullness of the color. unfortunately, it fell the first day so I have it taped so that the bottom doesn't fall off. i am hoping the birds begin to use it."
1,Really Wanted to like this,"OK - before the comments get out of control, let me say a few things#1 - I love Salvatore's work - I loved the Drizzt series and his work on Amalur and I have no ill feelings towards him AT ALL#2 - I have grown up on D&D; and understand fully the game and its mechanics and everything within, having following since second edition#3 - over 50% of the books I read are fantasy genreI could not get into this story - none of the characters had any life to me and the whole thing just seems like a waste of pages (or download in my case) and I am confused.Every time that I wanted to quit, I told myself that it was Salvatore and it would get better - all the way until i hit the final page - what a colossal let down and a waste of my brain pan -Sorry folks, but I cannot support that which I do not like, nothing against the author, but I do not like this book in the series."
4,Absolutely Wonderful,"This is an absolutely wonderful book. The characters are magnificent, and very funny. The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars is it seemed that Danika, the main chacter's girlfriend, was the hero. Now that i've read the other novels, I know that that isn't true. The ending really suprised me! As Pikel would say ""Oo Oi!"""
3,Dissapointing,"I found this book to be very hard to get into and not a very entertaining tale. It was written well, and was slightly better than mediocre, however, I found it to be unnecessarily violent at times. In addition, I found it dissapointing at the end. Barjin was supposed to be one of the most powerful priests Castle Trinity had ever seen, yet he was very easily defeated. Salvatore made a point of showing the reader how powerful Barjin was, and I felt the end was rushed and I was unable to believe that a man of Barjin's power would be dispatched so easily"
5,Another Master piece by Salvatore!,"No matter what kind of book you like this has it! You reallyget to know the characters and watch relationships develop,it also has adventure, trechery, and a touch of humor. Thisis a definate MUST READ!!!Lord Theasa"
1,A Mundane and Horrible book.,"I completly hated this book, and it was quite a chore to finsih it. Maybe im just spoiled after reading Drizzit books... But this book is horrible. The main characters are just mundane good guys and bad guys with no character devolpment and the fight scenes are boring,predictable and very unrealistic (even for a fantasy novel). The only way i could reccomend this book if you like straight out black/white evil vs good and good always truimphs over evil books with no imagination and creativity."
2,seems well written but not what i'm looking for....,"I read the first two chapters of this book, and although Mr. Salvatore seems to write very well, even after reading the first tw chapters i was disappointed. There is too much magic in it and i dislike some of the things about the charcters. Otherwise it would have been ok."
3,"A great, magical, enchanting series... a bad book","The Cleric Quintet is a masterpiece of Salvatores, in my opinion far outdoing Any of Salvatores oither works. The series contains many believable characters, stunning action sequences, and a realistic Romance between Cadderly and Danica. At points in the seond, third, fourth, and fifth books, I laughed, I cried, and I clapped. That said, let me move on to Canticle. Canticle was just plain horrid. It reads as a cutesy, yet dark, childrens novel, with emphasis based on the ""silly"" aspects of thew characters, rather than the realistic. All the characters but Cadderly, Danica, and Druzil read like cheesy soap opera characters. Thus, the book itself garners a one star rweview from me, but the potential greatness earns it two more."
4,Bene tellemara!,"This was a well done book to start the series with. The premise of the story took me a little time to follow, but I enjoyed reading about Cadderly and the other great characters around him; Ivan and Pikel are the kind of dwarves I love. The Chaos Curse wasn't exactly something I understood, but the climax of the story and how it affects the main character was unique.Some would consider this a mediocre book; bland, boring, or slow. But I thought it was refreshing to read and just follow an adventure, uncertain of whether the main character had the strength to get out of situations or not. Since the main character differed from most others I read about, it was very exciting to watch him progress.The evil characters were well sculpted too. I'll be interested to see how they change over the next books, especially a certain imp.I give it 4 stars, simply because it was a good book; not a great and spellbinding literary piece; just a good book."
4,Lacky of the stupid one.,"I have enjoyed alot of R.A Salvatore's books. This one is no exception. The characters are very different from his usual mix. Which is good and bad. Some of his characters are good and strong and interesting and others like the love interest and the headmaster are rather shallow. The plot is fun and the villains are well thought out, especially the Imp. If you enjoy the forgotten realms line of books then give this one a read."
3,Almost a good sword and sorcery beginning for a series,"The idea of a place where a lot of different priestly ordersof magic exist along side each other.The book deals mostly with a priestly school and librarymuch like a Catholic order on monks or a Buddhist order of monks.The young hero is a second generation student ( no celibacy here).Magic like Druid shape changing and alchemy are going on side by side with martial arts and theology.An attack by a evil (demonic) order of priests that worships the goddess of poisonis the theme of the book with a chaos causing spell at the center.So we have the young hero, his martial arts girl friend and some others holding off a master of the dark arts."
5,Clean Raw Leads,Really enjoyed listening to some cool music. Nothing sugar coated about these guys playing. I just liked the idea of hearing every instrument clear. Best song I liked is Cheri Love Affair.
5,Happy Times,"I have just finsihed reading Those Wide Open Spaces and it is a great book. It is a book that the whole family will enjoy. It has been a long, long time since I went to those Saturday matinee movies in Philadelphia and watched by hero on the screen, Roy Rogers. This book brought back such wonderful memories that I had forgotten. The biographies about each star was very interesting with information that I had never known before. You will really enjoy this book and I recommend it for all ages. Looking forward to his next book."
4,Those Wide Open Spaces,"This is an excellent compilation of nostalgia about our twentieth century western movie heroes. It brought back many memories of my youth, when life was more simple and childhood heroes were easier to find."
1,It was Empty,"The product arrived empty. When i opened the box, the perfume had been watered on the box. So i paid for nothing."
2,Charming Story Drowning in Smut,"I am a long-time Anthony reader and I am certainly no prude but this series is uncomfortably graphic. The storyline sucks you in instantly but you have to wade through scene after scene of graphically detailed sex. There are numerous rape scenes and our heroine (Gale) decides at one point that it is best not to report a pedophile.The storyline itself is nothing new. It is the classic fish out of water/man of the people rise to power story. You know the one, he is better suited for the job because he didn't want it and has no political ambition. The fish out of water portion is how uncivilized he is. Think Beverly Hillbillies but in this story Jed Clampett becomes president not a millionaire.Even though the concept is not new it is still a very nice story just be prepared to skip about every 4th paragraph because it seems like that is how often the graphic sex scenes appear."
4,Vintage Piers with sexual twist,"It had all of the elements of a Piers Anthony book with the strong sexual content added. I always enjoy his word play and even though it has a lot of sex in it, this book and series does tackle some of the sexual social issues in todays society. As usual it was also a quick read."
2,And I like Piers Anthony!....,"I like Piers Anthony but this is not one of his best books. It is a series of little stories with very little to push the story forward. Yeah, just not worth the time to read, sorry to say."
5,The Best.,"This book is essential for the student of Medieval Philosophy. It is the best, I prefer it even over E. Gilson's introductory Medieval works. It is not superficial, it is rigorous and yet not boring. The serious undergraduate's thirst will be quenched. His history is accurate. This is the standard by which the rest of the Medieval texts for undergraduates will be judged."
3,Dreamy to a New You?,"It was relatively decent in quality, adequately informative, and pretty enjoyable `read'. Most of the book revolved around ideals and dreams that the reader *should* turn around and apply to his or her own ""future-view""... though the methods to actually carry out this path are not quite concretely described. The section on creativity really piqued my interest and had some good ideas. I would recommend this book."
3,meh,I purchased this for a drum as it was recommended on the product label. I think similar products would do the same trick.
3,Left me a bit cold,"I wanted to like this one, I really did. Honestly though, it left me cold. While the graphics and sound were all decent enough, I just could not bring myself to care about my characters or the story. The story was very linear, and felt no emotional attachment to what I was doing with my character, unlike Baldur's Gate 2, which pulled me in with its eccentric characters and an environment that changed more according to my actions. Obviously, some people like this one, and it is certainly hard to find fault with the mechanics of it, plus it has a huge fan base of mods and multiplayer virtual worlds. But if you want an engaging story, I would look elsewhere."
5,Worth the wait,"I waited for five years for this game and I am not at all disappointed. I opened it up last night, installed it, and sat in awe while I played all night until I fell asleep at the keyboard. I'm still so in shock at the grandness of it all that I'm going to have a hard time explaining my feelings. Even on my measley - by their standards - 400mhz G3 powerbook it runs beautifully. Not astoundingly fast, but the only problems with loading were with text conversations in large areas. The in-game system is easy to understand and use, the characters are as well done as you would expect, I absolutely love the music. Also, it's the closest by far that I've ever seen to sitting at a table and actually playing pen and paper dungeons and dragons. Congratulations to the companies that created and put it out, it's a thing to be proud of and has accomplished the feat of playing D&D at home by yourself.My only complaint: Waiting a year longer that they advertised for the mac version to come out."
1,DONT BUY IT IT WILL NOT WORK!!!,"this program runs off of powerpc which is a set up that mac no longer supports. it will not install or run on any os newer than snow leopard. there are no cracks or patches to get it to work anywhere. do not buy it for mac!!! it's fun but it will not work, at all, ever, for any reason, if you have anything newer than snow leopard. being Lion or mountain lion osx. the computer will not be able to run it."
4,"Great, but not so expansive.","This game has an immersive plotline with several subplots. It plays like reading a good book or watching a good movie, only it's interactive. It is quite versitile and open in that you can use single-player characters in multiplayer, but restrictive in that ultimately, there's only one or two paths to follow. That goes for plotline, character development, and even the equipment you use. This is as much fun as real Dungeons and Dragons as far as adventuring goes, but I'd still rather have the face to face interaction, roleplaying, and character development that Neverwinter Nights lacks."
3,MAC Version,"If you want to play a fantasy RPG, this is a pretty good one. There are a couple of things about it that I found frustrating:henchmen - you can only give them potions which they use right away, nothing else.the BIG DISSAPOINTMENT was that the module designer program that comes with the PC version of the game is NOT AVAILABLE on the MAC or LINUX versions of the game - so you cannot create your own modules. You can still do the on-line play, and the DM client is included so you can DM the game."
4,Great seat with ONE flaw...,This seat is AWESOME and so EASY to use. I love the fact that I dont have to remove the straps to adjust them to different heights just one squeeze of the button and slide them up or down. Its very roomy and comfy and my 2 year old LOVES it he has been in it for about 1.5 years and still has plenty of room. I love the fact you can adjust the recline position of the seat even when using it forward facing since most forward facing seats only have one position UP RIGHT well not this one I can keep my toddler slightly reclined for those long trips so that he can nap comfortably.The only thing I HATE about this seat is that you have to completely remove the back cover (you must use a screw driver to remove the 4 screws) to take the cover off so that it can be washed.I would definitaly buy again if I had too.
4,We really like it,My husband and I each bought car seats for our cars when our son moved up from the infant carrier. He bought the Evenflo Triumph 5 car seat (mainly because it was the only one that would fit in his car) and I bought the Costco Alpha Omega Elite.I love the Evenflo Triumph 5. It takes some getting used to as it has a crank feature on the side to tighten the straps. This was a little different for us as we were used to the tightening feature on the infant carrier. The straps on this seat NEVER tangle for us as another reviewer noted. I feel like my son is strapped in really tight when he is riding in this seat. We have a newborn daughter and we will be purchasing another Triumph 5 when she moves up from the carrier.I would recommend avoiding the Costco Alpha Omega Elite at all costs. The straps on that model are constantly twisting for us and we never feel like our son is in there tight. My husband curses the Alpha Omega on a regular basis.
5,An spellbinding thriller with a sense of humor,"Clary Hale's children have been left home alone... or so they think.Underneath a faade of suburban bliss all hell breaks loose when a psychopath obssessed with his childhood sweetheart comes calling and leaving a bloodbath in his wake. With crisp, edgy writing, funny lines and characters one can't help but care for, Kit Craig (pen name for cult-favorite horror/Sci-Fi writer Kit Reed -- ""Tiger Rag"", ""cry of the Daughter"", ""Catholic Girls""-)creates a roller coaster of suspense without the formula that has made such authors as Sidney Sheldon, Mary Higgins Clark and Iris Johansen so commonplace.Here, you never know what's going to happen next... and it is all great fun!"
3,Boulder,"I'm reading this book now and it's kind of like pushing a boulder up hill. I want to know how it ends, but it's a struggle to get through it. I would probably read this author's next book though, just to see the growth."
1,Poly bags from 007 Design inc aka ProPackagingSupply is no good,The poly bags sold by 007 Design Inc (aka ProPackagingSupply) has adhesive that resembles melted hot glue and does not stick to the bag properly. I would suggest you avoid buying this item from this seller. These bags from other sellers do not have this issue.
2,It works - just not very well.,"I bought this a while ago and while it sounds like a great idea, it just doesn't work very well. It is battery powered and is REALLY slow and weak. So, you pretty much need to adjust it by hand to where it is all but clamped to begin with. So, I guess it works, but I don't use it at all because it is just too weak."
1,"Ther she is Miss America: the Politics of sex, beauty & race in America's most famous pageant","this is the most disappointing book i've even read on the pageant. Poorly written, with way too much analysis of each topic that becomes as remote from the main topic, (the pageant) as it can get. Other books get into the contestants & the comptitions that keep them interesting and readable. This book is completly unfocused & frankly, boring."
4,Delivered as sold,"Functional, possibly a little too wide for the visor if you are tall. Making looking at traffic light a little difficult."
3,Danielle Black Velvet Pouch,"The pouch seems to be sturdy. It has two compartments, which is great for storing a small supply of makeup for overnight on one side, and your make-up brushes on the other side."
2,Annoying,"I think Sarina Paris could have a pretty voice, but you really wouldn't know from this album because of all the affects that are put on her voice in every track. She also gets too high pitched on some tracks and grates on the nerves. Her cover of ""True Colors"" is awful because of the computerized sound of her voice in there. ""Look at Us"" is the only good one in my opinion."
5,Amazing Music!,"Typical love songs are slow and sad, which make them boring after you listen to it for a while. This one gives a energetic beat to the music. It should be a great for anyone needs some energy in their life. All the songs have very similar style as Look At Us and Just About Enough. If you love those two, you will love the album."
3,"Empty pop, but addicting","I usually don't care for music like Sarina's but for some reason her music just dragged me back. In many ways I want to hate it, but I just can't."
1,"Sarina, go back 2 Paris",This is one of the worst albums I own...ALL the tracks sound alike...and the melodie's are distracting!
5,Great CD!,"I have liked every song on this CD at one time or another. ""The Single Life"" is one of my favorite songs, but they are all really good!"
3,*Sigh*...too bad.,"Well, I'll give her credit. She has an absolutely lovely voice, and she can produce a wonderful song (Look at Us). The trouble, as it has been for so many other artists, is filling an album. Other than the slightly rebellious The Single Life the uncharacteristically angry Just About Enough, and the ever-so-teensy-bit-slightly experimental I Love You, there isn't a shred of variation here. Lovely for a short listening, but it gets old very quickly.It's far from a lost cause, so I'm giving it 3 stars. Still, given her undeniable talent, you have to think she could've done a lot more. (The greatest tragedy, of course, is that she never did *any* more after this.)"
5,Sarina is awesome!!,"This CD is wonderful!! Anybody that loves music with a good beat would enjoy this CD! I love it! This music is great to dance, sing, exercise,etc. to. I listen to it every day."
4,Vocoders At Best!,"Sarina Paris's CD is a very good one! Her music is danceable yet with a pop appeal. However, there is a dark side: The voice os Miss Paris. It is not her REAL Voice it is 'vocoded' which menas someone played the notes she was supposed to sing and mixed it in to her real voice using a machine called a vocoder. However, this CD is very well done. Not really the lyrics, but the songs are danceable and fun. There's the first single ""Look At Us."" Then the outstanding ""You"", the Vengaboys-esque ""So I Wait"", the best song ""Just About Enough"", and the only ballad ""True Colors."" All in all: VERY NICE!"
1,No Shogun,"This one's a real stinker. I began reading it hoping that it would at least be a cheap knock-off of Shogun, but it's much, much worse. The story is lame, the writing pathetic. It's a travesty that trees were felled so that this book could be published."
2,Same Game,"This game is the exact same game as last year. From the main menu to the gameplay. I was shocked how similar Madden 2003 is to 2002. The only thing different is the soundtrack and the addition of the Texans with it's new divisions. You also have rookies in the game like David Carr and Joey Harrington, which 2002 doesn't have. But everthing else is the same. The franchise mode, custom league, season mode, practice, etc.I often find Madden saying the same sentence three plays in a row, and then not say anything for the rest of the game. Its more like Al Michaels 2003.It also could be harder. I went 16-0 and won the Super Bowl my first season on All-Madden. I did a Franchise and decided to trade some of my players to other teams only to find out that the computer was incredibly stupid. You can get pretty much anybody you want if you offer them a draft pick.If I were you, I would buy this game, but make it the last Madden game you buy on playstation one."
3,DOES NOT COVER AUTO A/C SYSTEMS,"Good book for the basics, but it leaves out auto a/c charging and diagnostics. Since I bought the book specifically to learn auto a/c procedures, I wasted my money. This lack should have been explicitly noted in the publisher's blurb."
5,Well layed out and completely covers basics of HVAC.,"This book is layed out well and completely covers the basics of HVAC. Any person who has used NAVEDTRA Manuals will find this to be both similar in lay-out and comprehensity of subject. It is inexpensive for the depth of knowledge contained. For the price, I don't worry that it may get wear and tear as I carry it around in my service van. You may be interested in Modern Refrigeration and Air Conditioning (Althouse, Turnquist, and Bracciano/ 18th Edition) the ultimate inclusive textbook as used in trade schools and colleges. It is relatively expensive but worth the investment for a career person. I have both."
2,Basic but inexpensive book,"As someone above pointed out, this is a very basic book. The theory in it is ridiculously oversimplified and the description of many working and diagnostic procedures lacks detail. On the other hand, it is not very expensive compare to other books on the subject."
1,"Will not recommeded, useless information.","Well written book if it's still 1995, this book is out-dated and ancient. It was published in 1995, it don't even cover any of the tools and gauges we use today to trouble shoot or service the modern air conditioner or Refrigeration Systems. This book should be thrown away, it had useless information as of June 2007."
2,Disappointed,The problem I had with this book is that it's geared toward the mechanical side of servicing. There is no indication that is what your buying. Not exactly honest.
3,A fun little sequal to a great movie.,First of all this is not at all as good as the live action first movie. I think you have to be an idiot to expect it to be. If of all if you enjoyed the first movie for its comedy you will hate this movie. The comedy is mostly bad and the fun humor of the first Evolution had to be dumbed down for its Saturday morning origins. If you liked the first movie because of its alien busting action you will love this. This movie is full of alien busting fun and we are intruduced to Scopes the leader of the Genus (as they are called in this sequal) who is a great villian and it was unfortunute we didn't see a live action version of him in the first. I enjoyed the first for both alien hunting and comedy so I give in a 3 out of 5.
4,Revealing & Important for Young Writers,"This film is a mixture of live action and animation. The film has three alternating narrative lines: Franco's dramatic reading of ""Howl,"" which includes interpretive animation; the ""Howl"" obscenity court case (against Ferlinghetti), and an interview with Franco playing Ginsberg which is used as a commentary on everything Ginsberg. All three parts form a nicely tight-knit union, which offers insights both on ""Howl"" and Ginsberg.I resisted this film for a while because I did not like the idea of watching an actor imitate Ginsberg. I still have a problem with that, but after watching the film, what I took away were the distilled and sensitive insights into poetry, humanity, and society that it delivers. The film resists stereotyping Ginsberg, and it gives some pearls of wisdom that young writers could learn a lot from."
4,A true son of Walt Whitman!,"Impressionistic and episodic in structure, this film and James Franco's excellent acting are very effective in bringing to life Allen Ginsberg and the times in which he lived. Not a complete biography, it gives you a very clear taste of his anarchic, loving and very sexy spirit and to want to know more.I saw him in real life only once, at the very first National Gay Rights March on Washington DC in 1978. Remarkably, a million people attended, and Allen was up there, on stage, reciting a poem in celebration of the event and feeling so jubilant that at times he had to jump up and down with joy! A lovely and loving man, he is truly a son of Walt Whitman in his celebration of life and love regardless of the boundaries set by others."
2,60's coffee house pot era movie to no where,"I grew up during the era of coffee houses of Amsterdam, pot smoking hippies, ban the bomb, burn the bra down with the establishment. That's what the movie eaks of. If your into deep thinking because your life revolves around the dream world of gay love and drug use, you will love this 60's drama. Personally, I am glad I only rented this ""deep movie"" of two gay lovers whose ""rhymes"" would only make sense if you were high. On the positive side, while the story and the ""xxx?"" historical poem, and Ginsberg's life story with its center point being a nothing rambling poem, had its 15 minutes of fame, it left me cold. The animation did much to try and save the value of the movie and added some clarity to the verses. However, save your money and get clean. LOL"
5,Most enjoyable; a tribute to a sweet man,"I'd seen Allen Ginsberg in his later years; he was a bit chubby and hairy and as charming as a spring day. Howl takes place long before that, and I was surprised how Franco resembled Allen in his earlier years. The court scenes, well presented by Hamm, Strathairn and Balaban, as well as the various witnesses, were compelling, mixed with flashbacks of Mr Ginsberg's motivations. There is no ""script""; all is exactly as said from all. This is admirable, and makes this film all that more compelling. Mr Franco is excellent in his earnest display of the angst that Mr Ginsberg must have felt. I was impressed. DVD extras have some great insight into the private life of Allen Ginsberg, a sweet, harmless poet who had passions that simply needed to be expressed. I recommend this film to everyone who wishes to be enlightened to the censorship that used to prevent a man from speaking his mind. Mr Ginsberg was a pioneer, much more than many realize."
4,beat poem,"this movie is a poem in frames. shows all the passion and all language inovation from beat generation. ginsberg broke the rules, he is a liric rebel, someone who never accepted any moral code. the animation in the movie is quite amazing, you feels the words with that images. james franco's performance is wonderful, dazzling!"
5,An unforgettable classic,"DeBalzac's 'Pere Goriot' is a fantastic novel. Taking us into the realms of Eugene de Rastignac's impoverished life, 'Pere Goriot' is a brilliant statement on the French astistocracy in the 1700's. But brilliant characters and flawless writing make it an altogether unforgettable novel."
4,"Amazing work, but binding is awful.","That was my first time reading Balzac and he truly had a gift with characterization and documenting Parisian life after the Bourbon restoration. The French was not so hard to read and any advanced student should handle it. I don't so much want to comment on the work itself as much as on this particular edition. The supplementary reading is very helpful. There were a few typos here and there (the most shameful being a pure grammatical mistake), but my main qualm is with the binding. The book started falling apart barely after I started to use it. I suggest you be careful with how you handle the book; for me pages started falling out in droves."
1,Hardcover version print quality terrible,"I ordered the hardcover version of Pere Goriot. The print quality is horrendous, the letters are very faint, hard to read, and at some places even missing. I asked for a replacement, which was the same. Do not get it."
5,Worth Every Penny,"Once you open this book you won't want to put it down. There are so many hints and beautiful patterns. The author includes very useful illustrations and instructions for the beginner, and many useful stitch patterns (insertions, edgings, textured stitches, filet crochet, etc) so that the more seasoned crocheter can add a few new tricks to her/his bag!"
5,Lefties too,"This is a really good crochet book with very clear instructions for both LEFT AND RIGHT hand crocheters. It has an inspiring number of old and new pattern stitches and some interesting projects (cute little fine yarn anklets & a multi, multi-stitch philosopher's coat). Love it."
5,Excellent Crochet Resource,"This book is a must have for beginners, and those interested in doing more on their own. I recommend this book to anyone who has just picked up crocheting. The directions are easy to understand and THOROUGHLY illustrated (a huge plus). The book also has a nice array of projects, but is more oriented as a reference, not a book of projects.The section on different patterns is what I use most...again, thoroughly illustrated and photographed. Thanks to this book, I am making my own designs now instead of buying patterns from the store. There is also a great selection of trim/edging patterns, so you can add something special to an existing item, or add on to a current project.I cannot say enough good things about this book. I only wish there were more Donna Kooler projects for crochet available in stores (they all seem to focus on her needlepoint projects). I can't wait for her Knitting Encyclopedia to come out -- it's already on my wish list!"
5,Exciting Crochet Book,"I have been waiting for a crochet book that deals with colors and this is certainly it. I found this book easy to understand and did I mention the COLORS, hehehehe. Instructions for the right and left handed. Bravo Ms Donna Kooler on a job well done. Thank You."
5,A must have!,I have made ponchos and shawls and scarfs only using this book as a reference and I'm not a crochet expert...I began to crochet about 2 months ago nd this book has been a perfect support.It also brings diagrams of the stitches which I found very helpful in the beginning when written instructions look like chinese for me
5,Absolutely the best!,I love this book. It is well written and would be great for a beginner to start with. The illustrations are right on and the diagrams for stitch patterns really make it easy to follow with the instructions. This book will keep me busy for a long Long time.
5,Absolutly Wonderful,"I love this book. I have been crocheting very simple things for years, but I had not done many patterens before I got this book. I have not done any of the projects in it yet, but I love the patterens for all the different stitches. I have several crochet books, and this is the best. Wonderful for ther person just learning, as it has basic technique and easy projects, but also good for a more advanced crocheter, with sections on thread crochet, fillet, bead crochet, and wire crochet. An astoundingly good book."
2,Lackluster,"Donna Kooler should stick to cross-stitch. The instructions leave a lot to be desired and mistakes are evident throughout the book. The book itself is very large and difficult to bring along with you in your bag or purse, and does not stay open well if you are trying to look at the pictures and do the step at the same time."
5,Indespensible....,"How did I ever manage without Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of stitches? I have found that designers often overlook some of the most basic instructions a reader needs to get the project done. Kooler has stepped in and provided all manner of instructions for experienced and inexperienced crocheters in her nifty encyclopedia. She even throws in a few projects of her own, including a beautiful `wedding keepsake'. Her book includes many examples of the old-timey stitches, including antique pieces of preserved lace, as well as specialty and exotic items such as `Tunisian' crochet.The examples in this book range from simple to complex and some involve embroidery and knitting finishing touches. One item, a little blanket she calls `Baby Bobbles' looks relatively easy to make and it is awfully pretty (all single and double crochet, the bobble being a cluster of double crochet stitches)."
4,Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Crochet,"I particularly like this book because as well as the usual stitch instructions and some very interesting patterns, it contains a brief history of crochet. This is very hard to find. There are many books with information on the history of knitting, but this book is special because of the crochet history."
5,The best Crochet book I own!,"This book is my favorite out of all the crochet books I have or have seen. It's very clear and easy to understand. The pictures are nice, and there's a neat section on the history of crochet to read. I love how the directions tell you to chain in multiples of whatever number so you can apply a design to any project."
3,Easy to follow,"This book arrived so quickly and was in perfect condition, even though it was listed as used. Excellent service. My issues are really with the book. It's easy to follow and understand the directions, but the names of stitches are not consistant. If you are looking up popcorn stitch, it's called something else so you have to check all the pictures until you find what you're looking for. It is helpful, but not the easiest to search."
4,Deal Breaker,"Really good book, I loved it. The solution was kind of an unfair surprise but the suspense kept me turning the pages. I recommend this book to anyone who reads and enjoys Harlan Coben."
2,Myron Boitar.,".Deal Breaker. - Broken, could not read it and returned it. I liked his other books, maybe I have outgrown this type of thing. Bored, bored, bored."
5,Top-Notch Mystery,"I picked up Deal Breaker one afternoon, started reading around 2, and finished the book in a single sitting. A light, gripping read, Coban clearly excels at both weaving a suspenseful mystery and creating enjoyable characters. I picked this up after reading One False Move, and can't wait to read the rest, provided I can find them."
4,Good read,I really enjoyed this book. Well written. A good story line. Well developed characters (one of them not too believable however). A page turner. The book provides great entertainment.
3,Only Okay,"I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't care about how realistic a story is. The ""snappy repartee"" made me think of 1940's books with the fast comebacks and wise cracks. It was generally a fairly good story, but I wouldn't read it again if I had a better choice."
3,Not as Good As I Had Hoped For,"This is the first book in the writers' Byron Molitar series and it has been recently reprinted. It is fast and harmless reading with the writer managing numerous plots and sub plots in a deft manner. There does not appear to be the suspense in this work that the writer is able to bring about in his works that he has written that do not utilize his trademark character. Where Coben is the master at the surprise and twist in his other works and one is rapidly turning pages in order to see what type of a ride the writer chooses to take the reader on, this is missing in the Bolitar books. One continues to read because of the skill of the writer yet the end result is not nearly as satisfying as in some of his other works."
4,Loved It,I really enjoyed this book. This is my first Harlan Coben book and I will definitely be continuing this series if not most of his other books. I loved that it wasn't the typical cop mystery. I'm not going to go into the plot summary since so many others on Amazon already have. But I will say I enjoyed the secondary sports theme. I really liked the chemistry that was developed between Jessica and Myron. I loved the Win character. He's so fascinating and mysterious. There are a lot of twists and turns in this book leading you down the wrong path. Stay on your first instinct and you will still enjoy this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves a humorous mystery.
4,Good beginning to a fun series,"Myron Bolitar, sports agent and former pro basketball player, keeps straying into well constructed mysteries. The dialogue is great and the supporting cast members are example after example of PI novel archetypes turned on their ears. Especially Win, the Hawk to Myron's Spencer. Great fun."
5,Fantastic,"Anything that Harlan Coben writes, goes superb. Try any book from him. you'll be delighted"
3,DEAL breaker,"Deal Breaker pales in comparison to Shelter. While it was suspenseful, it was unfortunately sometimes predictable. I prefer Bolitar`s nephew."
2,Deal Breaker by Harlan Coben,This book was recommended to me by a friend who knows what kind of books I like but she goofed on this one. I made myself plow through it but it was hard to do.
5,I LOVE HARLAN,Since I now read the first novel in this series I am looking forward to all the other ones I love his writing
4,Show me the money,"Harlan Coben is relatively new to me, but I've thourghly enjoyed the works that I have read so far. With ""Deal Breaker""; however, I slightly got tired of some of the repitition and seemingly long wait for the ""punch"" of certain segments. I didn't find a real ""can't wait for the next chapter to see what's going to happen"". Now this has nothing to do with his writing, which I find facinating and with just enough wit to turn up the corners of your mouth. Deal Breaker is one of the earlier Coben novels (1995) and later offerings have proven to be much more to the point with the hook to keep you turning pages. You will eventually become a Harlan Coben fan, all you have to do is keep reading him. Amazon has several Coben novels, enough to get you hooked, so keep looking and take some of the not so good, with the really good."
3,Deal Breaker,"The book has Myron Bolitar, a sports agent and former basketball star, negotiating a contract for the top college quarterback prospect. The star's girlfriend turns up missing and then her father is found dead from an apparent suicide.The story is a fairly good read although for me it was fairly obvious as to the outcome. Coben does a good job with the characters and Bolitar in particular was strong. Overall it was a worthwhile novel to read."
3,Come again?,"Did I miss something, or what? I purchased this book from Amazon based on its 5-star rating, but I beg to differ. A couple of laughs, a half-decent story-line, but that's it.His books are often mentioned in Forbes magazine, so he must have a great press agent. I'll try one more of his books before writing him off...."
3,OK,"I think I expected more.I think I expected more.I think I expected more. Ok,OK,OK, I don't want to say more"
3,deal breaker,"A good book but it had too many characters to keep track of for me, so it got a little busy and confusing who a possible bad person or good person was and trying to go back and remember a situation that had happened with a character ...but all in all it was a pretty good read not one of Corban best"
3,Good Start but slows down dramatically,"Coben grabs you right away, his strength, with a good seemingly good story line. The problem is it begins to meander about a third of the way through. The story also goes from reality based to absolutely inconceivability."
5,Meet Myron!,"When I first got this audiobook, I was skeptical. A mystery with a sports agent as the protagonist? Really? Sounded way too cheesy. But I gave it a listen. First thing, yes it is a bit cheesy! But that's part of the charm. Coben mixes in wit and humor into his story to keep it fun. And the narrator, to me, had perfect delivery of this wit. As for the mystery aspect of the book, I was pleasantly surprised! Coben really knows how to throw around plot twists and keep the reader guessing.This was my first Coben book and it hooked me on his books!"
3,"Sassy, but just average","I'm another one who was really looking forward to reading the Bolitar series. And although I wasn't necessarily disappointed with Coben's fairly standard whodunnit plot , I didn't get that ""gee, I can't wait to read the next installment"" feeling either.Myron is an ex-basketballer cut down by injury before making his mark in the NBA who has turned PI. A likeable hero, yes, but not as interesting as his sidekick, Win, the gun-toting, martial arts expert resident billionaire stockbroker.Obviously there's plenty of intended tongue-in-cheek in the writing, but for a more engaging hero of his type try Val McDermid's Kate Brannigan series."
5,Harlan Coben books,I love Harlan Coben books. I bought all his books and read them in copyright order. Coben is at the top of my list of favorites.
1,I don't understand the love for this novel,"Nothing made sense. Yes, the investigators pieced everything together. But no real human beings would behave the way the characters in the novel did. I guess I'm supposed to believe that all the characters in the novel are complete idiots. But I'm a bigger one for wasting several hours on this book."
2,Yet Another Adventure of Bulletproof Clowns,"All the hallmarks of H.Coben are here: the plot is simply superb, the delivery is annoying but this time without extremes, the clowns are still bulletproof."
5,A new find,"I love reading series. Picking up a new book from one of my favorite writers is like visiting old friends. There is no adjustment period, now awkard silences, just immediate pleasure. The only problem is what to do between new books? Luckily something wonderful happened; I just discovered Myron Bolitar and his supporting cast. I picked up Deal Breaker after reading a few of the reviews posted here and I'm so glad I did. The story was fun to read and I enjoyed getting to know the characters. The best news is that there are several books in this series that I will now get to read. Now if I can only pace myself and read them slowly.."
4,Better than I expected; light read,"I bought this book because of the good customer reviews, although I didn't really expect to like it. I was pleasantly surprised. It moved well, the main characters were engaging, and the descriptions were good. There was, of course, the overt male chauvanism you'd expect with a book centered around the sports world. I could have lived without reading about what a hot babe each of the female characters was (with no other redeeming features that I could see). And I found many of the secondary characters to be sort of one-dimensional. Other than those two factors, pretty good book."
2,Leisure Story,I listened to the audiobook of this story. The narrator was great-very funny when speaking as Myron Bolitar. The story was just okay but the character of Myron Bolitar made it interesting. The audiobook is probaly better to listen than just reading the book
2,I've Read Better,"I have really enjoyed some of Coben's novels, but this wasn't enjoyable. I generally don't like his Myron Bolitar books as well as his stand-alone novels, but I liked this the least. It seemed like a formula. For example, every time Myron got in a jam, Win was there to save him. Usually, I can't put Coben books down, but I found this one hard to finish."
2,I cant't understand how this saga is so popular,"I bought the first book in the Bolitar saga because of Michael Connelly. I am a huge fan of Harry Bosh and I thought (as the writers are friends and also speak great things about each other) that I would enjoy this saga. I didn't. The second book is even worse. A sport agent who lives with his parents and solves crimes? The story is even worse, believe me. I don't know if the story gets better (because I know there are many books in the saga) but the first two are the worse."
4,"Fun, interesting read.","The story is interesting. The author's first published book, so it's dated 70's. But it's good. Funny. Dry wit and interesting. I laughed out loud more than once. Enjoying so far and I'm 3/4 done. Saw Harlan Coben on Murder by the Book on TV and thought his writing would be good. I was right. Will read more of his."
4,Good Book,I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more Myron Bolitar mysteries. Harlan Coben is definitely one of my most read authors.
4,Coben cooks up a great read,"Harlan Coben's Bolitar books can grab you on the first page, engage you with characters that elsewhere would seem unreal, and trap you in a plot that cannot go on without you! This first one is good but not his best, and what better reason to read them all? His people are witty, worldy, and oh so human. And underneath all that, there's a quiet lesson in doing the right thing, even if it hurts. More, please."
4,Deal Breaker,My first book by this author and truely enjoyed it. Very suspenseful and full of twists and turns. Highly recommended.
2,NOT YOUR USUAL ZAWINUL,"If you like Big Band and Zawinul, then this one is for you. I happen to like Zawinul A LOT (been listening to him since his days with Miles, Cannonball, and Weather Report), but I am not much for Big Band. SO, this one is just not my ""cup of tea"" despite my fondness for Zawinul. Joe Z does best, in my opinion, in a small combo environment: Adderly, WR, Syndicate. The Big Band seemed like it was mostly studio pros who were good, not great, musicians (Zawinul usually played with the best), but collectively were just not ""tight"". Some of the band solos lasted waaaay too long - and Joe Z was too often buried in the background. I'd give this one a 1-star, except I recognize that it is my strong preference for Zawinul in his natural small-combo environmet that makes me disappointed with this recording. Zawinul was a virtuoso, a genius, an innovator and an original - I just prefer his music a-la-Zawinul, straight with no chaser, and this one is not."
3,Slightly disappointed,"After hearing clips, and even downloading ""A Remark You Made,"" I had been coveting this disc for some time. I loved Joe Zawinul's harmonic sense, brilliant writing, and singular improv. For me, however, this is one of those 2-disc releases that might have been better off as a single. The second of the two holds my interest MUCH more, perhaps because of the song selection. Joe's arrangements (I assume) do leave me with renewed hope for the big band format - nothing on here sounds stale, like some other big band material can, and ALL of the players are wonderful, particularly Alex Acuna & Victor Bailey."
5,Thank You Mr. Zawinul,Thank you Mr. Zawinul for sharing your music with us and I wish that someday there will be a new Weather Report with Mr. Shorter. Your music will live forever. El mundo necesita musica de Jazz como esta simplemente lo mejor! Long Live Weather Report!
3,It's an inner tube,"Holds air and does the job it was intended for. Can't do any better than that. Easy to install, just don't pinch it."
5,Terrifically relevant today ... 50 year later.,"I highly recommend this movie; hopefully it will be re-released to DVD one day. Incredible cast and the themes on business are exceptionally current. William Holden is at his peak; and the speech at the end is 100% right on. The character of Shaw reflect QUANITATIVE business today (it almost put our car companies out of business). I see it in the company I work for and in the management above myself -- they live in fear and have forgotten what they are in business for. Ms Treadway is perfectly a symbol of the company heading for its own distruction (suicide).Anyway, if you want to learn about the QUALITATIVE side of Economics (mostly long since forgotten about as it tend to be LONG term based and not short term ... short term is predictable and has little risk; yet tends to sacrifice the longterm good)."
5,Excellent Movie,"This is a top-notch movie. It is star-studded and has a high production value.However, Barbara Stanwyck fans will lament as her scenes are few.If you are looking for a good William Holden movie, this movie fills the bill. He carries the movie quite well."
4,EXECUTIVE SUITE COMMENTARY,"Star-studded story of how a new CEO was selected when the one man company's one man died. Good, although somewhat dated."
5,Wonderful Drama,You'll never see a movie like this on the contemporary movie screen. Grab it while you can!
4,Very good character drama,"I remembered this film from years ago when I was younger (I am 33). I watched this on either AMC (before they had commmericals) or TCM as the movie where the guy has a fit at the end and breaks the table. Later, as I grew to appreciate William Holden, I realized he was the guy and I watched the movie again. Great cast of 1950's heavy hitters: Holden, Barbara Stanwyck, Dean Jagger, Paul Douglas, Fredric March (who was one of Holden's boyhood idols), Nina Foch, June Allyson, the list goes on. I am glad to see this finally coming on DVD."
5,Executive Suite,This is a great short story. It's a shame it's in Black & White.I enjoyed it immensely.
3,A Great Cast and a Great Director are Not Enough,"I'm going to swim against the stream of the other reviewiers. EXECUTIVE SUITE proves that a great film must have more than a great cast and a great director. At the beginning of the film, the president of a major furniture manufacturing company dies suddenly. All the junior officers are caught in a power struggle seeking to find a successor among themselves. The movie plays like a soap-opera, only with better acting.If you think about it, ask yourself why we watch movies? Because they take us to places we normally can't go and allow us to meet people we normally never would. In EXECUTIVE SUITE we meet normal business people experiencing normal business problems (not normally of this magnitude, of course). It's just not very exciting. The film is well made and mostly well acted (except for Stanwyck, who overplays her role), but just a little too ordinary."
2,Very Disappointed,"The mats where a bit faded like they've ""been around for a while."" But I guess the most disappointing thing is that the mats did NOT come with the holes that fit into the pegs on the floor of my ML500. I probably need to call the company and complain but I'm sure it'll be some type of hassel to get it corrected."
4,Good book,"Mark Gold is a bright doctor indeed and this book is a comprehensive source of modern psychiatric information for depression and other mental illnesses. However, treatment resistant depression is a serious problem and that fact is that many people simply do not get better from medication, no matter how many strategies they try. Medication has a tendency to stop working and only now are new therapies being invented including transcranial magnetic stimulation, and recently, vagus nerve stimulation. Gold says that ""only the rare person will fail to get better."" Fact is, medication is usually not the answer for complete relief in of itself and should be combined with some type of psycotherapy for maximum effectivness."
4,My kid loves this game!,Got this game for my 6yr olds birthday and he loves it! He plays the game constanly! He likes to see how much destruction he can do! I think it also helps with eye/hand coordination! Educational and fun!
4,Best weather game ever!,"This is a great game for anyone. You don't even have to like tornadoes to like this game. You can control F0s, F1s, F2s, F3s, F4s, and F5 tornadoes in large praires or towns or dairy farms or cities or even make maximum destruction in an amusment park and destroy tons of rollercoasters and ferris wheels. You can make objectives in the game or just freeplay by pressing tornado alley on the menu. Enemies like police choppers or planes or weather chaser trucks will bring down your power. When the power bar gets empty, the tornado flies back into the clouds, the weather gets sunny, and it's game over. However, it isn't that challeging, it's a highly-recommended game for anyone!"
5,fun for tornado obsessed child,"To say my son is obsessed with tornadoes is an understatement. He walks, talks, and thinks tornadoes every waking moment, spinning around the house picking up and throwing things.Thankfully I found this game which has allowed him to virtually be a tornado instead of actually throwing and breaking things in the house.The game includes 2 levels, one better suited for older/experienced gamers as it has tasks to be completed and levels to reach. There is also a 'tornado alley"" included which is better for the younger or less experienced gamers as you are just a tornado and move around destroying everything in your path.Although the game may not sound fun, it is actually pretty entertaining and fun even for my wife and I (and we have no interest in tornadoes)."
5,Kerouac in the 21st Century!,"If you like Kerouac,If you've ever made a rug angel,If you've ever danced with abandon,If you've ever made a journey of the soul,If you've ever looked at the world through a haze of clarity...this book is for you.Author josh davis certainly has a muse within..."
5,What Mr. Marley would sound like today,"roots reggae has sort of fallen down these days and and has been over taken by dancehall and rap like reggae. There are still a few out there keeping the roots alive. This, in my opinion, is a classic. Nuff said. de only other ting I&I haffe sey is the spirit of Mr. Marley roars strong with in dis lickle son."
5,Rastamon vibrations - excellent songs!,"I didn't know who Ky-Mani even was until I seen ""Shottas"", an excellent movie about Jamaican gangsters. My first CD was ""Radio"", which I was VERY pleased with. I decided to search for other music by Ky-Mani on Amazon, and came up with this disc, ""Many More Roads"" and another called ""The Journey"" - his debut album from 2000.I bought both of these CDs from Amazon, and listen to them quite a bit. The lyrics are explicit, so if you are offended by this, he also offers the ""clean"" or ""edited"" version.The music is a blend between hip-hop, reggae, and rap. Being a fan of Motorhead, Black Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, and hard rock/metal in general; I don't usually like ANY rap or hip-hop - but this is Ky-Mani!If you like Bob, you'll like Ky-Mani. ""Dis bwoy bring da island sound to da world - just like 'im fadah. Long live the Marleys!!! Jah bless!!!"""
1,"Don't recommend, period!","Bought three of these based on reviews from their own website. Should have known better. My air conditioner filters more particulate. The filter intake barely could hold a tissue in place, so you can tell there is really not much volume passing through. The fans are not strong enough to pull air through the filter. The filter medium is just too thick and air does not easily pass through. The ozone feature deoderizes, but I wanted air purification. We noticed no difference in air quality. Go with a better known brand like the Hamilton Beach. To the reviewer who suggested the filter cover may not have been removed - the perforated cover was removed."
3,not bad but not good,"this product indeed circulates the air and makes the air seem less stuffy. it feels good but at the same time the awful smell it lets out can make you feel pretty bad. walking by this unit i feel very sick because of that weird smell it emits (i think its ozone, and yea, it even smells horrible when the ozone button is OFF). i liked the way it kept my room pretty cool and dust-free but the smell is just overwhelming so i had to return it. if it wasnt for that painful smell, which is ozone, this unit would be a good one, i want one like it, but without the damn smell.Update: Just to let you all know, ozone is actually very harmful to your health. This product claims to have a button to turn off ozone (which you will notice increases the horrible smell it still emits while ozone sanitizer is off) but it can't ever be turned off.Here is a link as proof that ozone emitting air purifiers are detrimentalhttp://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html"
2,Very Loud + Little Purification = No Recommend,"The only reason I gave this product two stars is because it worked better than having nothing at all. I am very allergic to my wife's dog which brings about asthma attacks so I originaly bought the Biozone 3000w and it worked like a charm. Unfortunatly it was just to strong for the bedroom, but very quiet (it is rated for a minimum of 500 feet, so in the 200sqft bedroom it smells a little like bleech) so it now easily purifies the rest of the house all day long. I read some good things about this product from Surrond Air and thought I would give it a try. First of all it was very very loud, I was ok with that because I have slept through earthquakes, my wife also falls asleep easily. The problem is that it does not work. I put the biozone back in the room after trying this product for three weeks and I am sleeping well again!"
5,The Best Book,"My husband and I both loved this book. I've read it twice and am now ordering it for gifts, especially for dog lovers or owners. Check it out! It's a quick and fun read!"
5,Excellent Shape!,"The book arrived quickly and was in absolutely excellent shape, as promised. I was giving it as a gift, so had needed a book that was like new. I was told this book was just like new and indeed it was. They also sent the book out extremely quickly. I was more than impressed and would do business with them again."
5,I adore Boy!,"If you are a dog-lover this is a must-read. If you just like to read--this is a must-read! Wonderful accounts in the dog's perspective which makes some to-the-point, and hilarious observations. The is one to read over and over again because it makes me smile all the time."
5,Recommended for anyone who owns a dog,"I was given this book by a good friend who said she had tried, but simply could not get into it. Having nothing else to read I figured `why not', and after three pages could not figure out what it was that she wasn't enjoying. After a while I realized what it must be - that I am a dog owner and my friend was not. Therefore, I would not be surprised to find out that some of my fellow, not so impressed reviewers, were, like my friend, not dog owners too. This is a fun, easy, must read for every dog owner that will have you laughing not only at the prose, but also at your own ridiculous pet. Read it!"
3,A Dog's Life,Wasn't the best doggie book that I've ever read but it was sort of cute. A humorous look into one fellas life.
5,Peter Mayle best book ever,This book is a joy from beginning to end. I never read a book that elicited so much laughter. Peter Mayle has a way with words that makes writing seem easy. I especially liked the dog/child comparison (despite the fact that I am a parent and don't have a dog)
4,Funny and original,"What a great thing it is to see the world through the eyes of a dog. Mayle is a good writer, with an eye for details and conveys convincingly (and with a lot of wicked humour) the emotions of human kind's best friend."
2,"A long, slow, semi-humorous comic strip.","Where other reviewers seemed to believe that this was ""whickedly funny"", I can not concurr. It is a sweet little book, but not funny nor interesting enough to keep the reader's attention. Possibly the type of Euro-humor that is sadly lost on me."
2,"Sometimes funny, mostly not","This book, about and spoken from a canine named Boy's point of view is about as exciting as the canine's name. Although Boy's experiences are sometimes funny, the book lacks spark."
3,"A good, quick read for a rainy Sunday.","The author uses a dog as the vehicle to report observations about the human race. An interesting premise that makes for a ""cute"" read, especially if you are a dog owner.No further analysis is required. If you try to go deeper to find ""meaning"" in this book, you've missed the point."
4,Fun to Read for Any Dog Lover,"This rating is based on what this book is -- not as compared to all books written over the course of history.It's a quirky, tongue-in-cheek little book about daily life from a dog's point of view. Having read a number of Mayle's books with varying degrees of enthusiasm for each, this one is refreshing and different. Mayle also pokes fun at the dog owners as well. The book dragged a bit in places but also had some truly laugh-out-loud segments. It a word, it was ""delightful""!Recommended for all dog lovers with a solid sense of humor."
5,Provence through the honest eyes of a man's best friend,"I was reading A Dog's Life once while waiting to board a plane. While I was sitting there in the boarding area, I was so involved in this book that I wasn't conscious of anyone around me. I had started laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes and my face actually hurt from laughter! ""Must be a good book"", the lady sitting next to me said. That it is. A Dog's Life changed the way I look at my dog. It is heartwarming and above all, hilarious!"
4,Funny and well written,"Anyone who has read Mayle's non-fiction ""Provence"" books has already been introduced to his dog ""Boy"". However, A Dog's Life, goes into great detail into Boy's life--from birth to middle age (in dog years). It is well written and truly funny. If you're a dog lover like me, you'll find yourself chuckling and nodding in agreement throughout the book.(Rosie, my Labrador, gives this book Five Biscuits!)"
4,An Entertaining Light Read,"Being a cat lover, I wasn't sure how receptive I'd be to a story told by a canine. I mean, I like dogs, but I LOVE cats. Peter Mayle is an excellent writer. His words flow beautifully and Boy's escapades are thoroughly amusing.While reading the book I began to wonder if my cats see the world as Boy did. We humans must baffle domestic animals and I've been catching myself feeling foolish talking baby talk to my kitties. Do they think I'm a nut job? Probably. But they love me anyway.What did disturb me about the book was the two or three descriptions of animal cruelty. Butchers weilding brooms and neighbors swatting Boy with dead chickens did not make for pleasant reading. But overall I loved ""A Dog's Life"" and recommend it highly to anyone that owns pets.P.S. Excellent illustrations!!!"
4,atmospheric mystery,"Stroud has always been under the radar in the world of mystery novelists, which is a shame because his books are always interesting and well written. As another reviewer mentioned, he excels at creating a real sense of atmosphere, and characters you care about. This one, set in Montana, with some Native American characters is no exception. A book, and a novelist, well worth checking out."
5,Good.,"The Earth Rider - The Essential John Stewart 1964-1979Good product. I only purchased this cd for the song ""Gold"". One of my favorite and memorable songs from my early childhood. At the time, this cd was the only one available from amazon with this song on it. Would have been nice if their was a wider selection of cd's on amazon with this particular song on it. But otherwise, good cd and song. Thank you!!!!"
3,Great book for kids,This is a great sea story for kids. As an adult I even enjoyed it. It did not have as much adventure as some but is worth the read.
5,just what i wanted,I got what I was looking for. I bought this for my son who enjoys the Beast figure very much. He likes the realistic features of the toy and movable parts.
4,A Wonderful Beginner's Guide,"I found this book very interesting. I liked how Perry wrote an introduction of British Comedy leading up to Python. This gives you an idea of what the Pythons were up against.I also thought it was nice to split up the book into the mini biographies of each Python and then to go into the Python years as a whole. I especially enjoyed the sections on John Cleese and Michael Palin. Perry has a way of picking out the more interesting details. He does a good job of outlining the Pythons early careers in television and comedy. I was also introduced to a few post-Python projects through this book.This is a great book, although there are better in-depth ones. I would reccomend this book for those who are unfamiliar with Monty Python and who want to learn more, but individual biographies of each Python would be better if you want to get a more in-depth view of the Python People. Otherwise, a fantastic resource."
5,Greenies,My dog loves the Greenies. He is a 12lbs pug and the Tiny size were too small for him. These are a better size for him. He loves them. He recently decided that he didn't like many of his treats but he still loves these.
3,Greenies,I thought the greenies were the petite size for small dogs instead they were much larger. I'm having to cut them in half for my 6# Yorkie.
1,Dog wont eat them,Had to buy another box of the same thing at Petsmart. She eats those. Must not be fresh. How can you tell when they look the same.
2,Our dogs liked them OK...but!~,"Our dogs liked them OK...but!~....Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews....they are pricey and our two pooches love ....Veggi Dental Chews ...that's all we buy them now on Amazon of course!~"
3,GREENIES are GREENIES!,"Dogs love them, this box was economical as compared to vet prices, BUT they by no means help my dog's bad breath. I get stared down every night at ""TREAT TIME"" by my golden retrieve and sheltie, until I am forced to get out of my comfy chair and give them their EXPECTED DESSERT every single night. As always, my dogs walk all over me! lol"
5,Amazing!,While they are expensive Greenies do the trick for a dogs dental health. We tried a couple other brands and went back to these. The price on Amazon cant be beat. Dog is happy as well and gets excited whenever anyone says Greenie! His breath is so much better after just a day or two of use.
5,Simply The Best,Greenies are my pups number one favorite treat. He loves them and they help keep his teeth clean. I reccomend these to anyone who wants to spoil their pet.
5,My Westie Loves Greenies!,The Greenies are a favorite of my little westie. He simply doesn't want to wait one minute while I'm trying to get the greenie out of the seal fresh bag. Excellent product.
3,Not for my dog,"The product does seem to work. If my dog has had a few of these over the course of a few days, her breath is noticably fresher. However, I walk her every single day, and she usually has to use the bathroom around this time. I do not give her Greenies daily, but I have noticed that every time I do give her one in the morning, her bowel movements are not formed well and very loose during her afternoon walk. This could well be a reaction in just my dog and not for others, but I would rather err on the side of caution. These just don't seem to digest well for my pup, so I will not be buying another bag. However, I cannot completely slam this product, as it did help her breath somewhat.If it matters, my dog is a 5 year old long-haired Black Cream Daschund. She hovers between 12 and 12 1/2 lbs."
4,Hope to help dental issues,"All my prior dogs loved greenies, so I thought I would buy these for the dog I have now. Unfortunately, she doesn't love them, but it is hysterical watching her try to hide them under my husband's head when he is sleeping! Seriously! I think this is a good product and I think it will be good for her (bad) teeth, so I will continue to give these to her."
2,Our Shiba Wont Eat Them,They dont seem to work with our 5 month old shiba. Perhaps we'll try them when he is a bit older since we got the bigger size and our little Yoshi is still a pup.
5,Great deal,Will only buy greenies from here. The deal is to great to pass up! greenies arrived promptly . . .
4,Great Deal???,Purchased for a good price. My Chihuahua likes them. Did a subscription and received tub for $16.92. However a week later went on line to find the subscription price had gone up to $20.99 and no notification was sent to inform me of price increase.
5,My Dog Goes CRAZY!!,"I don't write too many reviews, but I read them all the time...so I though it was high time I wrote a review for this product (my dog told me to). I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat. Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit. First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out. The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before. The greenies are not hard - you can bend them. Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush. She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up. She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind. There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them. So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats! Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out."
3,No savings in 36 oz. value pac,Greenies 36 ounce dental chews value tub regular size with 36 chews in package is actually more per chew than the same item in the 27 ounce package. where is the value or savings in buying the larger package of chews. The 27 oz package cost per chew is 0.78 cents each chew the 36 oz package is 0.85 cents per chew. Why buy the larger tub for more money. am I missing something here? Great product though just misleading price and value advertising. 3 stars only because of the misleading value advertising.
5,The boys love these,We have two boys (Pekingese and a shih tzu). They stare at me every night until I get their dessert out.
5,"Greenies Tub-Pak Treat for Dogs, Large","Dogs love the taste of greenies. I ordered the large size for my daughter's two Standard Poodles. Yes, I would recommend this product."
5,best price here,"My poodle tends to build up plaque. $300 to fix at vet's office! I give him 1/2 of a a Teenie Greenie, twice a day (cut in half with kitchen shears). Plus, in the morning I wipe his teeth with a rag and then give him Biotene Oral Gel. So far so good: 3 years without needing another dental visit. Yea!"
4,My Dogs seem to like them,"We have a large dog (over 90 lbs) and a small dog (under 20 lbs) and they both eat the same size greenies. I can't tell if the product cures their apparent poop breath, but it helps immediately following the treat. We bought these because they were on sale and wanted to try something new. No issues, no mess, no pieces left around the carpet, no complaints! To cure the breath issues I try to bake homemade treats with parsley or mint, or do my best to clean the backyard daily to avoid any other 'treats"" being eaten. We will most likely purchase these again."
4,My Dog Loves Them,What can I say my dog goes crazy over these things - wish I really understood what are in them that makes it so desirable...now if we could only do this for vegetables so kids would be excited!!
4,My dog LOVES these,"Ok, can I just express how much my dog loves Greenies. I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them. She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them. She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other. She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it. The only downfall is the price. I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can. If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else."
5,My dog's favorite,"My jack russell, Didi, absolutely loves Greenies! All I have to say is, ""Do you want a greenie?"", and her little head cocks to the side and she runs to the Greenies bag. A greenie a day makes your dog very happy!!"
5,My dog loves these!,"I purchase a lot of my pet products from Amazon, and as usual you can't beat the price or excellent service!"
4,My pups love it!,"I have two dogs and they both love this it. I've been giving them this treat for over a year now and had no issues. The only reason why I give it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it does not help my dogs with their minor tartar build up like it's supposed to. Other than that, it's a great treat."
2,Way too pricey,"My dog loves these but I'm not impressed. They smell funky, they're super expensive, and my dog 50 lb dog can eat one in 3 seconds. They definitely did not improve her dog breath and made my pantry smell funky."
4,The dog likes them but I'm not sure they're all they're supposed to do...,"If I was simply buying these for bones I would give this five stars as the dog does love them. I'm not sure they're doing much for her teeth though. Shes a big chewer of toys, rawhides, etc and these bones are two bites and a quick gulp for her. I was hoping that they would last a little longer so she could get more of the dental benefits from them."
5,Our two dogs love these!,We have two 12lb and 13lb dogs. They love these. We buy the Teenie size to get more for our money so the box lasts longer.
5,Best,"I, like many pet owners, have issues with my little ones teeth. Keeping them clean is too hard and I put it off all the time. These are great. They actually work and my pups love them. This was a great price and shipping was great I will always try to keep some around for my little puppies."
4,Good Product,My sister's dog loves these and I was a little hestitant buying this product from Amazon because some of the reviews said they found little white worms in the packaging or the inside the greenies bag or box. But I've ordered them off here a few times and never had any issues. And they do help keep the dogs breath fresh.
5,My dog loves it!,My dog loves it though she is not hard to please. But her breath actually stinks less... so that's awesome!
4,Greenies Canister,"always a good item. The dogs seem to love them, just wish they were a little bit cheaper to buy"
5,~ Fantastic Price On Greenies ~ One Happy Pomeranian! ~,"Our Pomeranian LOVES Greenies, But I Was Getting Really Tired Of Spending Almost 50 Dollars A Pack At The Local Pet Store, So I Decided To Check On Amazon. I Spent A Lot Of Time Checking Prices From All The Different Sellers And Found That These Ones Were The Cheapest. I Ended Up Getting 2 Boxes For The Same Price That I Would Have Paid For 1 Box At The Pet Store.The Package Arrived Very Quickly & We Even Recieved A Free Sample Size Bag Of Dog Food, Which Was An Unexpected Bonus. The Only Issue I Had Was I Feel They Could Have Put Everything In A Smaller Shipping Box. Other Then That We Are Extremely Satisfied & So Is Our Sweet Little Pom. Thank You Amazon!"
5,Best Price,"For some reason, these are nearly twice the price locally. My dog likes these and his teeth/gums seem cleaner, but I don't know how to quantify that. The foil bag inside the cardboard container is reclosable which helps a great deal with freshness."
5,Greenies From Amazon,The price is excellent and the product arrived in a timely manner. I will always buy this product from Amazon.
5,Great treats,"Penny loves it. She keeps asking for more and more :)I was very glad to know that because its healthy, cheap and tasty. I definitely will buy more, next time!"
5,"Yummy and Good-for-you, Too!","These treats occupy my dogs (quietly!) while they clean their teeth at the same time. The first time I tried them, I bought the large ones to cut in half so I'd get more for my money, but believe me, it was definitely NOT worth the hassle. They are very hard and hard to cut. The ""Regular"" size is perfect for my 50-65 lb. dogs."
2,"Dogs love them, but they're not healthy","Greenies tries to position itself as a healthy treat, but I'm not so sure.My dogs love them, but buyers should be aware that one of the main ingredients in Greenies is wheat, which, according to my vet, sticks to teeth like glue. In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy. You're better off giving them a cheaper rawhide stick, which does a much better job of cleaning teeth."
3,"They do work, but this isn't a good deal","I bought ""Greenies"" after hearing rave reviews about them from friends. I buy all my pet supplies on Amazon.com and was able to purchase the value pack 36oz container when on a lightening deal ($22). My dog loves them, but she eats anything - I do think they help with tartar and her breath. My reason for 3 stars is because I don't feel like it is that good of a deal. There are not that many chews in the box and I thought I was getting a steal on them when I did. No one in their right mind would pay $130 for this container, I think even $35 is a ripoff."
2,Greenies Treats,Not the best product for the price. I got these for my dog that has plaque problems but I haven't really seen any improvement since we got them. They are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque I don't think they work at all.
1,Fatal,"Why aren't there more negative reviews on the site? Greenies are known for the harm they've caused many dogs; just look it up to see for yourself.Years ago, my Pomeranian died due to biting off a chunk of a Greenie bone and having it obstruct her intestine.It was a painful and horrific death and I found out the same thing has happened to many other dogs due to the fact that they are full of cellulose fiber. There are many other types of teeth-cleaning bones out there that WON'T seriously injure your dogs. They're probably cheaper as well."
1,puppy didn't like,"Bought the big box to be economical..bad choice. My dog ate one reluctantly and then never ate another--and this was over months. I gave them to a friend. My friend who owns a dog store said that many dogs have digestive upset with these, so I'm not sad that my dog didn't like them."
5,Great,This is a great deal. So much cheaper than the pet store. My dog loves these and it helps her breath smell better. It used to be terrible but she has gotten better after eating these. I just wish they lasted longer for her as she can chew one up in about 2 minutes.
3,Jumbo Greenies-Good but Very Expensive,"Bought the Jumbo Greenies for my Black Lab. He loved them, but at $2.66 each they are way too expensive for regular use. Didn't notice any difference in breath which was the primary reason for buying."
5,Greenies,"They are expensive, but the dog loves them! They definitely help freshen her breath better than anything else! I highly recommend."
5,Greenies,"Great product for your dogs. My dogs love them, and they also clean the teeth, you can't go wrong with this. Highly recommend!"
5,GREAT FAST SERVICE!!!!,MY DOGS LOVE THESE TREATS HELPS THEM WITH THERE GUMS AND TEETH ALSO REFRESHES THERE BREATH :) I WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT...
5,"Good treats, good price","My dog likes these a great deal, and they definitely make a noticeable difference in the build up on her teeth."
4,great,"This is something my dogs love, not sure about the teeth cleaning, but does a good job on their breath. I like this larger size box too."
5,Fresh and Clean!,"My reaction was ""wow!"" the first time I gave these to my 8 year old lab. His teeth were extremely dirty with what seemed like plaque or whatever it was on his teeth that I could not get rid of by brushing his teeth. I thought I would need the vet to professionally clean his teeth. I was amazed as to how his teeth became pearly white after a few of these greenies not to mention that his breath did not have a nasty smell either. I give these to my 2 year old pup as well. Her teeth have never been as dirty as my 8 year old's but at least her breath is fresher too.5 STARS ALL THE WAY!"
1,Company irresponsible,It's not the product I don't like it's the Nutro Company. The first canister arrived as a solid ball of Greenies. I contacted the company and they talked as if they were a tad interested and would take responsibility but in the end they did nothing. After a month they'd sent me a mailer to return some samples that I'd pried off to test if the product was safe for my dogs. They said they never received anything and maybe the mailer was lost in their mail room. That was the end of their customer service.
5,Yummy Greenies,My two yorkie/apso dogs come in from morning outing and get all excited waiting for their Greenie. They've been getting one teenie size every morning for only 2 months - but their teeth and breath are looking and smelling good. I recommend this healthy treat.
4,Dog loves these,Dog loves the taste but I wish it were a bit harder for him to scarf them down so fast! How's it going to clean your teeth if he eat it so fast little buddy?
4,Good...but overpriced,"Our rat terriers breath smells like death. These do help, they are just a little too pricey. Will probably continue to buy them. She loves them."
5,Teenie Greenies,My puppy loves these and I appreciated the good price and packaging and fast service. Saved me a trip across the island. Mahalo.
3,Worth the Price?,My dog really loves these treats but they are quite expensive and I'm not sure they really clean her teeth better than dentastix which is half the price. I think I'm just gonna cheap it out and maybe only buy these as a special snack once in a while.
4,My dog loves these.,"My dog is not wild about many treats but she loves Greenies. She just can't resist them. She never eats the cat's food, but once I had some cat Greenies in the bowl and she scarffed them up! The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that I wish they weren't so expensive."
4,Good value and dogs like them!,"These do help to keep my dogs teeth clean and they are just the right size for my 7 lb chihuahua. Much, much better value on Amazon then your local pet supply warehouse."
4,the Wonder Dog's Favorite,"My vet recommended these, and the Wonder Dog loves them! They're a bit pricey and smell terrible to me, but apparently smell great to a dog!"
4,My dogs love Greenies,"Greyhounds notoriously have bad breath. I first bought Greenies years ago when my first greyhound, Sophie, was alive. She very much enjoyed these treats and her breath improved, at least a little. Several dogs later, I was excited to bring a box of Greenies back to Mexico to give to my two dogs, Etheldreda - a greyhound, and Sadie - a greyhound mix. I'm sorry that I can't find them in Mexico and I hate to ration out the Greenies because of the short supply. Greenies are expensive, but they do help with the dogs' bad breath. And my dogs love Greenies."
5,My dogs favorite treat!,"Greenies 27 oz Canister Teenie 96 CountI limit my 2 female JRTs to 1 Greenie a day; I'm sure that they would many more if I would let them, they love them! I like Greenies because they are good for my dogs. I especially like the fact that they help keep my dogs teeth clean: I guesss that's why they are shaped like a little tooth brush. I am getting a great price from Amazon too!"
4,greenies teenie for clean dog teeth,my italian greyhounds loves these greenies for their teeth and have used them for several years as they are very prone to cavities. They are 8 years old now
5,My doggies love these,"These are the best doggie treats ever. My little dachshunds go crazy for these. If I forget to give them their morning greenies, they come looking for me in the house and leap in the air and whine until I get up and go to the cabinet and fetch them a greenie. They do a good job keeping their breath clean too."
3,Greenies,I do not recommend these for people. My dog seemed to enjoy them. They were too big for my cat.
3,Greenies never has clear description,"hello,i don't care if it's manufacturer's or Amazon's description, but it's weak. 1, you can't blow up product picture. 2. description is inconsistent. sometimes it states quantity in box, but most of the time, it does not, as with this size ""petite"". by the way, can someone tell the manufacturer it's bad french, there's no ""e"" at the end?!thanks"
5,Dogs love it,"I always buy these on line for the dogs because the pet stores and grocery store prices are four times more. For my small 10 pound dogs, I should have bought the teenie vice petite size though. Great product."
1,throw up every time,"I bought these as a treat for my dog and he started vomiting about an hour later. I thought it was something specific to that dog but when I tried giving them to my other two dogs- they both got sick too. I think they eat them like a treat rather than chewing on them and then they block their digestive tract. Whatever is going on, I wouldn't purchase them unless you don't mind dog vomit."
2,Not too thrilled,"I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this. I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them. Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies. Not neat and easily stored at all. The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies. I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored. My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one. My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog. My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described. Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing."
1,do not feed this product to pugs.,My pug almost died from this product. A piece did not digest and got stuck in his intestinal tract. He had to have emergency surgery and 3000.00 later is now OK. Any knowledgeable pug breeder will tell you not to feed these to your pug. All the company did was refund me 25.00 for the cost of the product.
1,No go,"My dog won't eat these things. I can offer her nothing else to eat all day and she still will literally turn her back and walk away from these things. I tried gifting them to another small dog owner, only to find they are warned against as a choking hazard. Turns out they are so gummy that they sometimes get stuck in a dog's throat and choke the poor thing to death. Maybe my dog knew something I didn't... or maybe they just don't taste or smell that good to some dogs. Buyer beware. (Message me if you want an almost full 96 count box for just the cost of shipping, since if you are going to buy them, I hate to throw away something someone else can use.)"
3,I don't recommend this treat for your dog.,"From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog. As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean. The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth. Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them. This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them."
2,Good but GONE,"Supposed to be for cleaning their teeth - right... well - that would assume they held up to some for of chewing... our little Border TERRIER (not Collie) ""eats"" one of these in about 5 minutes... too fast to be of any use to the teeth and almost too fast to cause concern in the digestive tract. Bummer too because these are supposed to be great for pups teeth... just an agressive chewer defeats Greenie... that's all."
1,Not the best,"My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out."
1,BEWARE,"I have bought greenies for my dog for 7 years (since she was a puppy). She has always had digestive problems, but we didn't know why. While googling greenies a couple of weeks ago, I found that several dogs have died because they were not able to digest greenies. Please do some research before buying this product again. It could save your dog's life. Since switching to another dog treat, my dog has not had any problems (although it has only been two weeks)."
5,Best price ever!,What a price for a product I always buy for my dog. Thanks so much Amazon! I will be back to buy more Greenies!
5,My dogs love them and have clean breathe,"No complaints. My dogs both enjoy them and they have nice breathe afterwards. My dogs are 10 pounds each and I got the Teenies. They are very chewy so it takes a bit for my dogs to eat them, but I think that is part of the fun for them. Highly recommend!"
4,Doggie Crack,"Dogs LOVE Greenies. We can't even say or spell the word without our three flipping out. Their daily Greenie is the high point of their day. Greenies work as advertised, keeping their teeth white and their breath smelling as good as a dog's breath can."
3,"Large size is ""small""",While my dogs do like the chews the picture is misleading. The actual package is small and so are the chews ( even the large size)My dogs' breath is a bit better but I'm not sure they are worth the price.I'll be trying other brands.
2,Please read---important,"Please read this, it might save your dog's life and/or health.This was on CNN and Veterinarians cautioned against giving these.I know , I liked those too, but our dog's health is more important.[...]"
1,Check Contents First,"Half way through the supply, I noticed that there were tiny white worms boring through a greenie so I checked the remaining greenies and they also had worms. Please empty the contents of the box and check the greenies when you receive your order before giving them to your dog. This may have been an isolated incident but it would only take a few minutes to check the contents for freshness."
1,Make sure they're not expired!,I've ordered Greenies two times now and both expire within a week of receiving them. I sent the first one back and won't see my money for 4-6 weeks. Guess I have to do the same yet again. Spend the extra dollar at the grocery store to be sure they aren't going to expire before you can use them. I don't plan to feed my one dog 30 greenies before they expire on the 4th.
3,Good for breath,"These bones are great for a dog's breath. However, I was looking for something that would take him more than a minute to chew. Still a good treat for doggy breath."
5,Why do they increase the price each month on the product?,I have subsribed to the monthly shipment of Greenies 27 oz canister teenie 96 count product and each month the price increases. If i sign up today the price drops to $19.94. Why the increase? Seems like they lock you in for a scheduled order and then take advantage of you hoping that you won't notice the price increases.The product is great and my dogs love them but the business practice of the price hikes is terrible.
5,Fantastic!,"My corgi loves these greenies! I like it how the greenies come in a zippable bag inside the cardboard box! I have the choice of throwing out the bag and using the box or vice versa!I chose the free shipping method. It took awhile to ship, but once shipped, it came in a timely manner."
3,Wrong size,"I ordered the GREENIES 'PETITE' size for my dogs, as I have done many times before thru Amazon. This time however, the WRONG size greenies arrived. The thing is, the box DID say it was the PETITE size on it! After I opened the box, I found that it was the next size up and too big for my dogs to eat. Now I have to try & cut these stinkers with a scissors each day! I'm NOT happy...but I couldn't return them as I had opened the package.I am afraid to order more, as the entire batch that Amazon has, may ALL be MIS-labled!"
4,Doggies Addicted!,"I have two Peek-a-Poo's and just say Greenies and they go crazy. These are the reformulated Greenies are made with gelatin compared to the old ones that had harmed some dogs and were pulled from market. These are easily digested as I started them out slow and made sure they chewed and not swallowed them, which could be harmful. I trust Amazon to sell me items that will not cause harm. I personally thoroughly check for anything foreign which is due to the manufacturer and not Amazon."
1,PLEASE RESEARCH BEFORE GIVING TO YOUR DOG!,"Read the stories online....dogs have died from Greenies. I gave my 50lb pound dog Greenies for the first time 2 weeks ago, and she became very very sick for more than a week. She was vomiting and having potty issues the entire time. These cause blockages and do not allow the dog to fully digest. I can't believe these are still on the market.From one loving pet owner to another - DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE GIVING YOUR DOGS GREENIES! TRUST ME."
1,The product is great.,My dog loves greenies and they work great. My problem is I ordered small size and they sent me large. Very disappointing.
1,Didn't receive what I ordered,I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. I returned the product because I did not receive what I ordered. Amazon couldn't replace my order because they couldn't guarantee I would get the right product if ordered again.
2,wrong size,I ordered the large size but received the regular size for dogs 25-50 lbs. My dog is 75 lbs and needs the other size.
2,keeps breath fresh but gives diarrhea,"I bought these without first doing some research. I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews."
4,The dogs love it.,Nothing wrong with this product as far as the dogs are concerned. They always want more than just one a day but we try to limit them to that amount for their own good and our pocket book.
1,"Dogs cannot digest this, vet told me to stop","Our vet asked us to not give our dogs these because they cannot digest them. Whatever they are made of does not break down once eaten, made my dog sick and when I cleaned his potty I saw entire chunks on the treat. They claim the new formula is digestable, but it wasn't for our dog at least..."
5,A great healthy treat for dogs,My dogs love this and I like the economy size. i have two dogs and they get really excited when they see me get their box of Greenies out.
5,Awesome!,This is a great product. My 2 year old Golden Retriever hates to have his teeth brushed and this product made his teeth white again. Great seller and great price too!
4,My cat loves the dog greenies,"I was looking for a way to help clean my cat's teeth so at first I tried the feline greenies,but he wouldn't have anything to do with those. I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door."
4,Greenies are great but....,"Great stuff, just a bit pricey. My dog loves them but I can barely afford to give her more than 1 a week.I can only afford these when they are discounted."
5,Dogs love it!,My dogs love greenies and they were a great price with quick shipping. Definitely need to buy more soon for my 4 miniature poodles!
5,Exactly as ordered!,These are great and buying them in bulk is the way to go. Arrived quickly and my dog loves them!
3,Misleading,"My dog does love these, and when I saw a 36oz Canister, I was ok with overpaying just slightly to get the can to store future Greenies in. However there is no canister. It's just 2 18oz packages in a paper box."
5,great,"I have used these on my other dog has well and wanted to try it with my new rescued pup & she loves it. Yeah its a little on the expensive side if you get the bigger box, but my dog actually prefers theses over the denta-stix by Pedigree."
5,His #1 Favorite!,"It has always been difficult to get Lucky to eat his dinner so I use treats to bribe him. Once he is done eating, he will seek me out for his treats. I will put 3 treats on the floor and he ALWAYS snatches the Greenie first!!!"
3,"Good, but...","Well, the dog loves 'em, and eats 'em as if it were a treat every to everyother night, but she still has a bit of plaque build-up. So, it's not a replacement for brushing, but I'm sure it helps somewhat."
5,Dycee's Mom,"I don't know much from a personal point of view, but Dycee say's they're necessary. She loves them and wouldn't be a very happy pooch without them. If you have a dog, you probably know what I mean. This is one of her MUST HAVES."
5,Greenie Clean!,"My dog loves these, This was an awesome price too! These are sometimes 40 bucks at the stores for a 27 pack. I will def buy these again."
4,Pooch loves them...breath and teeth are nice,My puppy loves them. She burns through them like nobody's business and they give her a softer stool but she really goes nuts for them. She has no tartar and nice breath though

1,a few key pointers to read before purchasing,"okay. Your first pointer: Do Not Buy. I have been plaing the guitar for 1.5 years but I will tell you I did not start out on this guitar. My neighbors have one and somtimes i'll try to tune it but it dosn't matter because they never play it. the strings never stay tuned and they are horrible quality strings. I own a Gibson Les Paul Epephone. It is my third guiar. Do not even buy your child a guitar unless they are interested. A way you can tell is, How creative are they? How often do they use thier right brain? If they are interested you have to spend atleast $115 for a nice guitar. My eleven year old self hopes that this helped you/ Thank you very much."
1,not a real instrument,"This is a toy guitar. I can not say that enough. It does not stay in tune. My son received one as a gift from a relative a couple years ago. The only thing I can say is that, if you just want to see if a child would be interested in guitar, then you could buy it for that reason, it's cheap enough. It would certianly not be good for a child with a real interest in learning the guitar as they would be disapointed in the guitar not staying in tune and might then lose interest. If your serious about a true instrument, stick with the known brands and visit a music store to learn more about what would be appropriate. The real ones (child size) can be found for around 100.00 so it's worth it."
2,"Looks good, sounds terrible","So, in this case we definitely got what we payed for so it shouldn't come as a suprise. It looks swell next to the Tacoma on the stand, but it is painful to hear. We couldn't get it in tune, much less keep it there. As far as I can tell, there's no way this will ever sound good.On the other hand, it works great for the four year-old twins that play it. Hopefully the sound won't drive them away from learning that instrument."
4,It was missing the pick,"My brother had gotten this guitar for christmas. He was all excited about playing it. We opened it and there was no pick. At first we thought maybe it didn't come with one, but we went online and once we found out it was supposed to come with a pick me were shocked. It is a good guitar though, but if your going to buy one you might want to buy a pick first."
2,"Poor quality, wouldn't recommend.","I thought that maybe we had a bad experience with this because our kids are only ages 3 and 4 when they got it. It sounds like other reviewers who got it for much older children had equally poor durability issues with this guitar. The screws which held our tuning forks rather quickly stripped and the whole functionality of tuning the guitar was shot because the tuning bases were no longer secure. We also had a string break with what seemed not extraordinary tension. My kids did love playing with this guitar despite being clueless to how it actually worked. It was dropped and stepped on frequently and did not lose it's integrity to be played. The tuning fork screws are miniscule and will not hold long. That, will quickly render the guitar playless. I would definitely recommend chosing another guitar over this one. You get what you pay for!"
2,Cannot be tuned,"I am knowledgeable about guitars so I was reluctant to buy this thing to begin with, knowing that you usually get what you pay for. But I gave it a shot anyway.This guitar is made to be BOUGHT not PLAYED.The intonation is so bad that it cannot be tuned, especially the low E string.The problem is the height of the zero fret.It looks nice, but no child can learn to play on this guitar. Save up and get one that can be tuned."
2,Just Buy A Real One!,"Just get a real one. It's a waist to get a student guitar. Trust me just spend $20.00 more on a real one, or better yet just don't buy a guitar. That may be the fad this decade but kids like me are going to need that money to go to collage or buy a car later on. Save your money kids, save your money!!!!"
5,would buy the dasco boot shaper again!,I am very pleased with the dasco boot shaper...I bought two for my boots and happy with the way they fit easily into my boots. I can't believe I waited this long to purchase something of this nature. I looked at several different styles and delighted I decided to try these. Anyone who has expensive boots needs to purchase a boot shaper to keep them looking good.
3,Not with standing,"The book to me wasn't what I was looking for,Although the info was withstanding it wasn't wordest as I had wished I know they were called teamsters,servants an so on I was looking for something that called them soldiers,Up to now you have had great matreilThank you"
4,he is fast but....,"Eldar no doubt is great Jazz pianist and probably the fastest ever. This album showcases his ""speed"" in well defined manner. But it is more of classic Jazz and jazz has moved very far from be-bop era since 1960s. That is what this album lacks. It lacks improvisations. Lacks electric sounds like ones in chic corea or joe zawinul or mile davis or Brian Auger and thus lacks imagination as well. If Eldar wants to 'call it a day' with his next album for his career then he can continue in same fashion. But if he has to survive mean world of Jazz where Joe De Franchesco rules now a days...he will have to be more than just imaginative..and i hope he will be ..else a serious waste of talent"
2,"Wow, he's so young! -Look at his fingers!","This is the perfect example of how jazz is at risk of becoming a purely academic subject of study instead of a vibrant cultural (real-life) life-force. His playing is so polished and contrived with his lines half-improvised (practiced a thousand and one times before -then rehashed ""live""). It doesn't sound like fun it sounds like a ""prodigy showcase."" I hear alot of great music though, but I just don't feel anything . . . I just can't like this album on the basis of : ""wow . . .he's so young!"" or: ""look at his fingers!"""
5,One Reviewer Must not understand the piano,"I am not sure where the reviewer who was a bit negative is coming from, although certainly entitled to his opinion. The comparisons he makes however, fall short. Comparing Eldar with Joey DeFrancesco or Chick's Electric Band is not valid, because the entities are different and serve a different musical purpose. The kid has it all, and I mean ""all"". The reveiwer must not understand the piano very well near as I can figure. I have not heard anyone get a ""sound"" like Eldar does really since Bill Evans, or Oscar Peterson, whom I have heard live 4 times.Most of the folks I know who gripe about someone having ""too much chops"", normally don't have too much chops. Oscar took heat for that, too, mainly by people who didn't get it. I am going to go hear Eldar again as soon as I possibly can. Fantastic!!"
3,Very Familiar,"Let's just say that this book hits very close to home. So close, in fact, it seems like it is real."
2,Too specific,"The book is written by the CEO of IMG, a company that manages international stars and athletes. The book is supposed to be about selling however I found it too specific to sports marketing and IMG. For example he talks about taking time, sometimes years to close a deal. He talks about large customers who expect you to ""entertain him and his people...at least once a month"". There are many salespeople out there who cannot relate to these scenarios. Many have only one shot to close a deal. Many don't sell to the type of clients who need to be wined and dined.There are many more examples in this book of situations which I feel are not widely applicable. In many senses it is not so much a book on selling as a manual on how IMG conducts its business. There are some useful sales tips inside the book but they are interspersed between largely irrelevant anecdotes."
4,A Good Guide for an In-Experienced Salesman,"Although it can be said everyone is in the marketing game, not all of us can say we sell for a living. Mark offers some great insights into an area that I have limited experience. From a 20 year veteran, I could see where this book presents a very high level view. However, for myself, the book is a great tool that can be applied to any selling opportunity. The insights and stories bring the examples to life and can be easilly be applied to my own situation. Business reading can be boring and uneventful, but Mark has the ability to create a scene where I can place myself sitting right next to him. Nodding in agreement to the client. Visualization is powerful tool and everytime I listen to his tapes I'm there selling my heart out. Hmmm, I wonder where my commission check is?The only book of Mark's that I have not read is the one on communication and I have already purchased it."
4,Good second seat for the money,"The Tribute is a very good value. I purchased this seat for my mom's car, as she would be caring for the baby during the day. It was easy to install using a seatbelt and if it needs to be moved to another car, it's not so heavy that it becomes a chore. I've moved it from car to car and it's very easy.The one thing that I would say is a drawback is that the cushioning is too thin. For now, because the baby is 3 months and the seat is so big, we are using Kiddopotamus' Snuzzler for additional cushioning. I would recommend this seat for short trips."
5,Second in the Trilogy,"Second in PC Doherty's trilogy about Pharaoh Akenhaten, now followed as Pharaoh by his only son (from a secondary wife, not the famous Nefertiti) young Tutankhamun, who came to the throne at the age of about 6 or 8 yrs old, and is surrounded by enemies. Also, the priests of the old gods want to reinstate the old gods. P.C. Doherty evokes the era, the sense of danger and doom very well. Again, it is narrated by the loyal Mahu chief of police, an actual historical figure of the time."
5,Have to have it,"If you are a Selena fan, you have to have this. It is awesome!!!! I watch it all the time and it never gets old. Selena and The Dinos were awesome!!!"
4,Not perfect in production but the Tejano queen's last concert...,"and one of her best. I bought a t-shirtof her in Houston back in '99 when I wasthere to cover a Thunderbears Ar.FL game.Rest in peace, princess!"
4,"Great Concert, But edited too much!","The concert is great, but they added unneeded graphics...For one, the split screen-shot during the disco medley...Second the slow motion during ""Cobarde""....Another during ""La Carcacha"" they stop showing Selena too much during her dancing...And the last they cut out something Selena says during her goodbye (this is edited on the CD and DVD...After she says ""Hasto Lo ego,Chow, Buenos Noche"" if you listen closly on the CD she says something else that is cut out, the only word I could make out was ""GROUPO""... Other than that, the DVD is great!"
5,SELENA FOREVER,"THIS DVD IS THE BEST TRIBUTE OF SELENA. I LOVED IT AND SO DID MY FAMILY! THERE WAS EVEN A NEVER SEEN BEFORE FOOTAGE OF THE MAKING OF ""SELENA"" MOVIE WITH JENNIFER LOPEZ. I WAS SO GLUED TO THE TV THAT I WANTED TO CRY BECAUSE SHE WAS SO TALENTED AND SO BEAUTIFUL. I REMEMBER I WAS TAKING A VACATION AT ENGLAND WHEN MY SISTER TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS KILLED, I WAS IN COMPLETE SHOCK. I FELT LIKE I LOST A FAMILY MEMBER BECAUSE I ALWAYS LOVED HER MUSIC. MAY HER LEGACY ALWAYS LIVE ON!"
3,A Final Goodbye Concert!,"This concert was good because it was memorable and a final goodbye to Selena! However, it is outdated and a little corny. I ended up giving it to my sister and she loves it!"
5,HARDCORE SICK RAPPIN' B.G,HOLY S*** BLINGING GANGSTA MUST BE WHAT IT STANDS FO' NOT BABY GANGSTA BUY DIS CD OR YOU GONNA PAY FOO' NICE AND SMOOTH IS NOT AS GOOD AS DIS IT'S ROCKIN' H**L BUY IT B*A***!!!!!!!!!!
5,i like the old cash money crew,"Bg started out young in the rap game.... And this cd is one of his best cds he made...... With guest appearances from bun b , mac, and many more"
1,1 star for 1 good song,The only good song on this album is N*gg* in Trouble because it has my boy Mac from No Limit. By the way if you want a good album get that World War 3 ya heard me.
1,who made this dude rich?,"I have listened to this album and I would just like to say this is probly one of the worst displays of rap talent in the world. (...)This is country cotton picking music but worst than that it's just plain bad music.They have no lyrical talent. Nobody will listen to this years from now (...)It is really ashame what Cash money has done to the rap game.This is just cheap azz music, I guess I can call it music?"
5,Chopper City,The album that starts the rise of the B.G. This is definitely prime material. My personal favorite is Retaliation. Definitely check this one out. You won't regret it!
1,tablet did not dissolve,"The Country Life chelated magnesium tablets were purchased before learning that magnesium oxide, which is what these tablets are, is the least absorbable form of magnesium. Still, I hoped these chelated magnesium tablet6s would break down and be absorbed. To determine whether the tablets dissolved well, I placed one in vinegar and left it for 30-40 minutes, adequate time for it to dissolve, or at least show some progress. The outer 'layer' had barely begun to break down in that time. The tablet was still solid. Since I have a bottle of 180 tablets, I'll crush them, or cut them into smaller pieces and add to milk shakes, until they are used up. I will look for another form of magnesium that can be absorbed more efficiently next time, and in capsules."
5,Love this stuff.,THis product is for expelling unabsorbed calcium and toxins out of body. It has to be chelated to work that way.
1,DANGER DO NOT BUY THIS STRoller,all the negative point the other review mentioned are true!! I bought this thinking I was getting a great deal on a stroller I plan to use for about one year. However --day one flat back tire. Day 3 other back tire flat --seems to be a tube design flaw. One month in my front wheel collapses --the stroller rolls over my baby girl --she walked away with out a scratch --but I'm not sure how but the grace of God. Customer Service never answered and I don't think they would have ever gotten back to me except the fact that I bought if from a pretty well know website (that would not take it back themselves suggesting to me there has been trouble with the model) and Tike Tech is crediting my money back.
5,ram cd,"Ram CD holder, looks great fits truck wonderfully, has excellent colors, and holds CD's in a easy to access place."
2,ram cd pouch,"recieved mine and the ram logo is crooked. very noticeable! This product says it is made in the USA, Jobs are so hard to come by now. You would think an American would take more pride in their work! - very dissapointed."
1,Doesn't fit,Bought this for my 03 Dodge RAM since it has the Ram logo on it. And the straps are not long enough to go around the visor. Otherwise it would do the job.
2,Plastic stuck,"The plastic wrapper melted onto the item & would notcome off. Not pleased, I wouldn't have item shipped in thesummer."
2,"John, Please Shut Up!","Terribly frustrating.In fairness, this documentary was originally aired on public television for an audience the producers apparently felt was more interested in Rubinstein's celebrity than in his music. But who if not music lovers will buy this DVD, and they will find only brief snippets of Rubinstein's playing.As for biography, the great raconteur does not get a word in to tell his own story until almost nine minutes into the program. Instead we are treated to a self-indulgent display of his son John's narration, analysis -- even his conducting!The many photographs of Arthur Rubinstein are marvelous (though other people in the photos are never identified), and a few moments with Daniel Barenboim provide desperately needed reflection.But -- tell me, someone - is there no better DVD providing a musical and biographical profile of Rubinstein? He deserves one."
2,"This is not ""The Love of Life""","I agree with another review that implores a dvd from the film titled ""Love of Life"", a documentary/interview with the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein. Here in Brazil the film was received, at that time, like a piano concerto: people applauded at the end of the exhibition! Please, the world deserves this gift."
3,Bring back Love of Life,"I just received the Feb 2012 Member Calendar from the Museum of Modern Art in New York. They will be showing ""Love of Life"" twice in February. I'm in Los Angeles and if I didn't already have commitments on both dates I'd fly there to see it! I saw it back when it was produced and have been trying to see it again ever since.I went online again to see if it was available and found all these other people who feel the same way as I do.Rubenstein is my favorite pianist precisely because that love is at the 'heart' of his playing! I would love to have this film as I remember it captured that so well."
3,The Love of Life,"I saw ""The Love of Life"" some three decades ago and it left an indelible mark on my memory. Great personal footage of Rubinstein, frank interviews, and footage of his concerts around the world make this movie a must see. Please release this movie on DVD."
4,"Strong Reference, More Cases Desired","'The Entrepreneurial Venture' is a strong reference that covers both strategic & tactical perspectives of the topic: from planning, launching to managing new venture. Each perspective is rigorously analysed & coherently presented; it would be a '5-star' book if the material is further illustrated by more case studies."
1,Damaged disk,"actually I cannot even give it one star because I ordered it last fall and put it away for my husband's birthday which was this week--when he opened it, the disk is broken. It didn't show on the label, but it has a y-shaped crack on the disk itself. I think that as much as I order from you that you should replace it,"
2,"Madden Football, or is it really just madness","This is very dull. The graphics are attrocious and the game play, don't even get me started on it.The extras are dull, the soundtrack is a bore (except for the anthem by GC, and their leads Joel and Benji probably could have made a better game) So in conclusion buy this game if you want to die a dull and painful death. *shout out to my fella Rafe (You forgot your diapers at Melanie M's)"
4,The tightest football game ever,"Thi isn the greatest game ever. With all the new players, an ability to throw sidearm, more defensive moves and better gragpics this is the best Madden yet! Has the best and easiest formula to work with and is hours and hours of fun! For $$$ it is a no brainer that you have to buy this game."
5,IT'S TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!,"This edition is far beyond 2002. There are more plays and features and on play now you can control classic teams like the '88 49ers. Also you can challenge plays, BUT there are no mulligans. Mini camp is the best new feature. In Mini camp there are 7 different drills. In Pocket presence you have to dodge flying tennis balls while completing passes to dummies. Once again IT's TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!"
4,Madden 2003,"Madden 2003 is a great game, with realistic graphics and gameplay. Better graphics then 2002. The off-season is very real and the manager as a new name to it. It has hundreds of plays and all the NFL playbooks.But there is one thing to it that I don't like, when you create a team you have to replace it with an existing NFL team. Versus in Madden 2002 there was an expansion draft at the beginning of the second season in Franchise. So that way you could have all the teams and it would be more realistic. Other than that it is a great game, you should buy it."
2,Letdown,"I AM a fan of football games but this feels WAY too much like NCAA Football 2003 with a different title and cover art. It does have different modes, not too deep. I was struggling last week with a decision whether or not to get NHL 2004 PlayStation2. NHL 2004 happens to be MUCH better. It also doesn't have a good ""addiction level"" as I call it. Besides, the box now has a hobby, collecting dust. Commentary is quite annoying. Just the same thing again and again and again. Anyway, if looking for football, buy it. Otherwise, buy a better game like NHL 2004 or Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee or even Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2."
3,"Starts Out Slow, but Finally Picks Up","Sonsteby was obviously one of the unsung heroes of the war. His work with the resistance was essential in keeping the Germans looking over their shoulders for the next incident. But, the book seemed to ramble for much of the first half of the story. I found it hard to keep up with the details, and often had to look back in earlier chapters to get myself re-oriented. The later chapters were much easier to follow. It was a quick and interesting read, but there are better books available on this topic.I'd highly recommend Blood and Water (by Dan Kurzman) if you are interested in a related story of the resistance in Norway."
5,I am interested in stories from WWII.,"I couldn't put the book down when I started reading it, and the fact that it's a true story makes it much more interesting."
5,"From the review in ""Gramophone""","The sound for Somm's new coupling of two previously unreleased Beecham Sibelius symphony recordings is not outstanding, with the Fourth in particular (BBC SO, 1951) being crumbly and emaciated. And yet if you're willing to listen through the sound, rather than to it, you will surely appreciate a performance that in terms of expressive shading, rhythmic flexibility and imaginative phrase-shaping has a discernible edge on Beecham's pre-war 78s, even from the opening cello solo (I also prefer it to the Beecham broadcast that BBC Legends put out a few years ago). The Sixth (RPO, 1954) is taken from a Prom and sounds a good deal better than the Fourth and, again, there's that feeling that the notes are being tended with a crucial degree of extra love, especially in the Symphony's touching coda. This is an important CD, though those who are normally wary of historic recordings should definitely sample before purchase."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"If you loved the first Empire Earth, you will hate this game! It is not fun, boring, and I had to deal with a million different glitches and other problems. I also had a problem because it was too slow. Once you get into the game, like most of these types of game, can be lower because every nation has expanded and more units are doing something. However, this game would take HOURS to load. This might be my computer, but I have a windows 7 and a XP, both doing the same thing. You should save your money on this game."
2,Not The EE your used to.,I was excited to get it at first because I enjoyed EE1 and EE2 but this is just a horrible game I played through it pretty fast and just didn't enjoy playing it as much as EE1 and EE2. No wonder this game flopped. If you really want to try it go for your money. But I suggest you just pretend to play it and go back and play EE2. or something else.
1,Not much to add!,"This game is garbage compared to EE1 and 2. What was the developer thinking? I cannot tell you not to buy this, but if your a fan of the gender you wont like it.Shame because the lack of popularity of this game may kill out the EE line.I agree with every negative comment made by the other users, and cannot really add more complaints.Stay away!Dan"
3,A bit laggy...,"I experienced a lot of lags when playing this. Things slowed down a lot, screens took long to load. Maybe the game is too taxing for my system.However, the Multiplayer was quite entertaining and I kept playing longer than I would have ever guessed.It's just a little sad to see the third installment of this great series going down the hill."
2,You've got to be kidding,"1) Graphics are terrible - far worse then EE2 but much higher systems requirements2) Voices are annoying at best, grating at worst3) Unit and building styling looks like a bad comic strip4) The gameplay is just plain boringWhat happened? EE1 and EE2 were so much fun, this looks like it was developed in 1998."
1,Horrible,"I've played EE1 and EE2, and this, by far, is the WORSTTT game ever.EE1 and EE2 are WAYYYY better than this piece of crap.It's very dumbed down and just overall retarded.Do not waste your money on this game. Look at other choices :)"
2,"Great delivery, and condition.","I received the product in good time and good condition. Had no problems whatsoever. The game wasn't like Empire Earth 2, but like all other commercial RTS games. The way they changed the game wasn't for the better, but closer to the standardized money making version of other games. This is my own personal preference of course, but I would have liked more of Empire Earth 2 in the game supported by bright new ideas in a third series of the title."
2,I am going to wait.,The reviews of this product showed an undemanding version that takes away from play instead of improving it. What a shame. I will reevaluate this game at a later date.
1,This is Empire Earth?!??,"If you played the original Empire Earth you will be sorely disappointed in this game. They utterly ruined the classic EE. I played the demo only briefly was could not keep going beyond 1 or 2 minutes. The goofy taglines for 'citizens' 'riflemen' and the 'helicopter' lost me. It looks like Sierra abandoned all hopes of recapturing the lightning they had in a bottle with the original Empire Earth.Save your money. If you doubt me, download the free demo which you can find anywhere online, before you even consider buying this atrocity."
1,Dumbed Down,"I have played each empire earth version always impressed at the strides made with each successive version...until this one. It looks like EE III was redesigned to better cater to players interested in a first person shooter (FPS) game instead of an RTS. The variations of the different cultures and their technology evolutions were completely thrown out in favor of 3 basic cultures: western, eastern and middle eastern. The more advanced technological stages were diluted and ""cartoonified"" into something resembling a weak PS3 game. The bottom line is that it looks like if you are interested in a rich gaming experience with plenty of variation and some realism thrown in, go this Age of Empires III. It is everything this game isn't."
2,EE3 ruined!,"When I first saw this on youtube, I was like, ""ok? this is wierd...."" when i read customer reviews i was like ""uh oh"" and when i tried a demo, i was like ""WT* IS THIS"" I mean, seriously, this game is WIERD! Wierd styles, especially wierd talking. Like when you select a builder, he says ""What am I supposed to, uh, funny guy!"" with a wierd accent. The style is like a lame strategy game mixed with a wierd cartoon made for 5 year olds. They completly changed the way you collect resources, instead of making people who mine and stuff, you gotta build seperate buildings. The AI is very easy, the first time i played i destroyed a normal difficulty enemy in 10 - 15 minutes. This game is stupid! Stupid talking, styles, graphics, etc. DOMT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS"
1,Save Your Money,This is the worst game I have ever owned. It seems like a cross of the video play of Zeus or Poseiden and Rise of Nations. Please save your money and spend it on a good game like pong.
3,Expected more...,"Those of you that still remember the first Empire Earth, will know that if you set-up the game for 2 players, the difficulty to the default setting and hit the start button... you'll be sit on that chair for 2hours++ just to get through the stone age.I could still remember that I use to play one battle for more than 2 days.For me the only really weak point of Empire Earh III is the game play duration. If you start a Skirmish battle with the same setting as meantioned above you'll probably finish the game within 2 hours. (So much for RTS). The rest of the improvements are quite nice, they have added ""World Domination"" mode (almost like the board game: Risk). Improvements are made on the character/object modeling an the enviroment.For those of you that like the long game play... stick to Empire Earth I. Other than that, the overall game experience is really nice."
2,Medieval Total War III,"-The most disappointing for this empire earth series it's that it doesn't have any story-lines for the three factions.-If you like Warcraft III, you're probably like the graphic in this game.-The gameplay for single player campaign is more like Medieval Total War II with RTS features (like gathering resources and building units).-Be aware of the system requirement, even with my thin gaming laptop, i couldn't play the game smoothly and had to turn all features to the lowest. below is my system:2.0Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo2GB of Memory RAMATI x1400 of 256MB"
5,Candiria Is the Best,This CD is absolutely amazing. I don't know anyone who can't at least appreciate how talented these guys are. Even my dad likes them and he HATES hardcore/metal. I listen to this CD constantly and it deserves WAY MORE than five stars. This is definately one of my favorite CDs. I highly reccommend it.
2,Disappointed- very cheaply made board,"We love playing Michigan Rummy and we were happy to find the game available online. However, when compared to a very old version of this same game... the bonus cards are different in this version and the quality of the board was a much sturdier plastic than this version. This game's board is made of extremely thin cheap plastic, very easily cracked and/or crushed. Not durable at all: we are thinking of ways we can reinforce the board due to the flimsy materials used. When playing we had to leave the board in the box to give it additional support."
5,Good for adults,Good get-together game for adults. We are using it to give some older people in the community a chance to get together with others.
1,unbelievably cheap,this game is not worth anyones money-the plastic is so thin that a sneeze would blow it off the table-save your money and make one yourself!!
5,Oldie but Goodie,Pressman Michigan Rummyis a game that is very similar to Tripoley that has been around a long time but has lost its popularity to be stocked in most stores that sell games. It's a game of chance that is easily learned and played by ages 8 years to adults. It's very fun as a party game for adults. Amazon. com was where I was able to find the game since the game I had for years has been lost with my latest move.
4,Rummy fun!,A great fun family game. It's a hit when friends and family come for a visit. Good value for the money.
2,cheap game,We have not used it yet but it appears flimsy at best.We were looking for the original royal rummy that rotates and works for several games like michigan rummy.
3,Right price for what you get.,You can't expect much for the price. I didn't expect much more than what it was. It's not suppose to be a family heirloom. I will work for a game that we play a few times a year.
1,michigan rummy,game is not the same as i played years ago it has pay cards that are not hearts. was expecting something different game needs more information then just a picture.
1,Check out Ebay,"Don't waste your money on this cheap tray. It is so flimsy, I doubt it will make it thru more than a few games.Ebay has vintage Michigan Rummy boards. Spend a little more and get a sturdier game tray."
2,Not a toy.,The whole thing about Michigan Rummy is the tray you place the money in. This one is so flimsy I do not think it will become a family heirloom. But it does serve the purpose.
2,Flimsy,"I ordered two of these based on one my daughter-in-law had been given some years ago. It's a great game - but this playing board is pressed from very thin celluloid and is so flimsy I feel it will not last many games. In fact, one was received (in Cincinnati)very slightly deformed as the box had been slightly crushed in local transit."
2,Unsatisfied Customer,"I used to have loads of fun playing this game when I was around 10 or 11 with my mother and brother and the neighborhood kids during summer vacation. We would sit in our garage at a card table (because it was the coolest room in the house!) and play Michigan Rummy and laugh for hours. I wanted to replicate those times when our family and friends get together and play games, so I purchased this Pressman version. I was disappointed when I opened the packaged and saw the poor quality of the plastic used in making the game board, there are no betting chips included (even though they are listed on the box as being included), and the game was also missing instructions. I was going to return the item, but figured I could buy the chips (or we could use pennies, nickles, and dimes) and copy the instructions off of the internet. It was just a disappointing purchase all around."
2,cheap plastic,"We've been searching for a Michigan rummy game board for family game night. I was excited to find this item and purchased two since we have a large family for game night. I was quite disappointed when we opened the box to find a thin, cheap plastic mould game board. We'll be lucky to have it last for more than a few games."
2,VERY flimsy tray,"This is a GREAT game that all of my family members enjoy. However the tray in this game is EXTREMELY thin and flimsy. When the game arrived, still new in the box, the tray had already sustained damage somehow and had to be pressed back into shape. The tray loses shape with just the slightest of touch. I highly recommend the game, but the quality of the Pressman version of this game is terrible. We are saving our money to get a wooden tray... This is no reflection whatsoever on Amazon--they shipped very quickly!!"
5,Kling4,Great book. Interesting to read about Fort Lauderdale & great suspense novel. Also intetesting learning about the salvage business. Love the main character!
4,Need a 4.5 rating,"A fairly fast-paced story that kept me reading until the end. I guessed the main points of the plot very early on, but then, only Agatha Christie can keep me guessing without cheating--holding back vital information. I figured out what would happen but was interested enough in the process to keep reading to see how it would happen. Rather like ""Presumed Innocent""--the fun is in the process. The characters are likable. I bought her first book in the series minutes after finishing this one."
4,Archie Moore,"Very good account of Archie Moore's career. He was a true character in an out of the ring. Does not go into the detail of a possible tanking of his fight against Rocky Marciano. That account was put in the Devil and Sonny Liston. But overall, it was very good."
1,no friends allowed,"What a dissapointment. They add all types of new play, improved graphics, and a chance to climb up the ladder of power. But, they took away why I even play the game. I actually have friends and enjoy playing games with them. If you dislike playing games with your friends, this is a game for you. If you like kicking some [rear] in a game and only being able to impress yourself, this is your game. This is a 1 player game. Unlike every other romance I've played (and I've played since part 1). I preordered it, with me and my friends dying to play. Then I opened the box and see it's a 1 player game. I sent the game back the same day I got it. So much for improving on a great thing. I recomend for the people that have friends, that you stick with romance 4."
5,Best ever strategy game this year.,"I've played quite a few strategy games in the past and this is by far the best one I've played yet. Every time you play the game, it changes. I'm looking forward to version #8. Thanks KOEI."
5,History,"This game is by far the best that Koei has put out yet. That could all change with the hopefull release of Nobunaga's Ambition Online, but for now ROTK7 is wonderfull. You have to play the game to really get a feal for it but just talking to someone who has played before and you will want to join in.I must say that the most fun part for myself was that changing of history. If you know anyting about Chinese history and youve played this game you know what im talking about. This game is a must have and deserves better that 5 stars."
2,not the best world tour only one good match,Hey this tape is ok not the best the WWF ever put out butthe only good match on here is the Hart/Austin match the rest are lameYokozuna and Ahmed Johnson vs. The New RockersBret Hart vs. Steve AustinDuke The Dumpster Droese vs. British BulldogAhmed Johnson vs. Owen HartAhmed Johnson vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsleyok matches the Hart/Austin match was the best to me i would rent this one if its out there thats it take care
1,You might want to go clip your toe nails instead.,Boring! Doesn't the front cover just scream awesome with Ahmed Johnson on the front? (Sarcasm) Even for the old school wrestling video collector like myself this was a hunk of boring junk.
2,poor resolution,search the picture on web and send to a printing co. I got this it sucks. Good lamination though
1,Boring and over rated,"This book didn't have many new additions and its rules for drug addiction and other ""evil/Vile"" rules left much to be desired. There where a few redeeming factors like a few of the special abilities for weapons but all together this book wasn't worth the money."
3,The Evil Anti-Defamation League hates this book.,"This book had some cool items, workable dieties, and useful spells, but the feats and classes were a bit silly for the most part. The worst things by far, though, were the assumptions about the nature of evil. They're somewhere between funny and offensive. It might satisfy players who've never really thought about it, but it's painfully simplistic and 'good-centric'. It's as if evil is just a collection of taboos and reactions to good; 'Oh, the heroes don't like undead? I guess I do, then.' Any DM or player worth their doritos would just ignore the alignment based stuff altogether - funny, considering that's what the book is supposed to be about.I think Monte Cook might be alignmentist. For shame."
3,Not Enough Information,"This book is priced incorrectly for the amount of information in it. (...) For all of the hype about exploring the ""dark"" side of characters and phenomena in the D&D gaming environment, what we're seeing are more and more prestige classes, more and more spells... D&D gamers are far better served by detailed explanations and examples. We don't need hundreds of prestige classes. I was expecting much more from this book, but I'm also starting to say the same thing about each release for the third edition. The core rulebooks, plus the FR campaign setting were great. It's been sliding downhill since those releases."
3,Not quite vile enough for my standards,"Monte Cook isn't a bad writer but I felt that this definitely wasn't one of his strongest books. For a book about Vile Darkness I felt it was just another source book to pump up monster abilities and powers. Oh well, guess it's too much to ask for substance these days in the big world of 3.5E."
3,BVD-ok but not great,"I purchased the BVD in hopes that the long avoided evil aspects of D&D would finally be appoched. However most of the book is filled with somewhat interesting magical items, prestigue classes, and powerful monsters. This is not a great buy."
2,"Not very dark, bland stuff","I thought the Mature Content warning on this book was nothing more than an advertising gimmick... the content isn't all that evil or offensive (at least to me anyway). A lot of what this book states is obvious and can be thought up by anyone with an imagination (evil weather, for example). Some of the pieces of artwork are well done but others left me cold. Taboo things like bestiality are touched on but what's in the book is nothing that can't be found in an encyclopedia or on the internet. I had hoped this book would really delve into the darker aspects of the game (and maybe it did before the editing process took place) but in its current form, the book only takes a mild look at evil. If you have an active imagination, don't bother with it."
2,Less Than Expected,"While the book certainly does offer new and usefull information, as well as a new perspective on D&D gaming, it's not really as vile as you might think - or hope. The book focuses a lot on dealings with outsiders and touches on a few of the evil deeds one can do, but I don't really feel that it adds as much of a vile element to the game as it could. From the hype, I expected more, and if you're expecting real degredation and evil, this is not the source to find it in."
2,Not what I expected,"Reading the description of this book lead me to believe it was a source book about the evils that could be inserted into some of the less savory areas of the campaign world. Like slavery and prostitution. And maybe some hooks to allow good characters to rail against them. However, this book does not have much of this information. It is largely a source book of foul extra planar creatures and the mortals who follow them. (Prestige classes, clerical domains, and spells included.)"
3,Pretty good,"If you can get it for under twenty dollars including shipping and handling do so (used copy for example), I wouldn't spend more than that ... lots of interesting ideas to incorporate into a D&D campaign but not as impressive and well written as say Buffy the Vampire Slayer RPG, Nobilis RPG or All Flesh Must Be Eaten ... not nearly as controversial as people are making it out to be (mildly so at best) but still it's a good solid entry in the D&D line"
3,a little bit heavy on the game mechanics,"First I want to say, that I am not a D&D; gamer, so some of my abjections may not apply to you. I mainly baught this book, because it ""offers an insight to evil"", which I translated into a psychological discussion and insight into ""how an evil mind works"". It does offer some motivation hints of the various villians, a GM can throw at his players, but that's it. A good portion is given to new spells and outsiders, whereas I never understood, why D&D; distinguishes between deamons and devils. Anyway, the book includes good artwork, some nasty spells (Death of Thorns.. my favourite) and a few prestige classes a vampire after 1000years on the material plane might pick up. Alltogether a mixed bag, IMHOOlaf"
4,needs a bit more,"I agree about the prestige classes, but I think the same could be said about all of the prestige classes save one or two-either they're requirements make them more of a hindrance than a help or they're simply too weak to compete with the base classes.There are some nice spells, some cool feats, and quite a few interesting bad guys.But I especially agree about the price. When you charge ""full price"" (what it costs for the player's handbook, for instance) you should have that amount of useful information. Both this and its sister Exalted Deeds need about 20% more ""stuff""."
1,Releasing this was a bad move,"This alongside the other rulebooks on store shelves makes parents more concerned with D&D than ever before. It's hard enough to defend rpgs without giving critics extra fuel. Are parents going to say yes you can go play D&D as long as the DM is not using the book of vile darkness or are they going to say don't go back to that bookstore, I don't want you playing that game anymore. Great job, Monte; the damage is done. Forget censorship, instead think before you release sick stuff."
4,"Interesting, but how much will ever get used in-game?","The book is an interesting read, but I'm curious to know how many DMs will actually use more than a small element here or there in their adventures. We have had rules for drugs and torture that we just made up for some years now and the rules in the book aren't going to replace them. Of more interest to me was the return of the actual lords and rulers of Hell and the Abyss including new character classes as their disciples and followers. Some of these are fantastic and can be added without much difficulty to most campaigns without unbalancing them too badly (IMO ;-))."
2,"Great looks, little content","Don't be fooled. Nothing ""vile"" about this book unless you have led a very sheltered life. Pretty much ""PG"" at best. The graphics are, as usual with WotC, excellent. As far as content goes: you'll get just as much for far less by doing a web search for ""torture device"", ""sexual deviance"", and ""lame evil prestige classes"". Out."
3,Not quite what I expected,"First thing - this book lives up to being vile and dark. It focuses too much on Demon Princes and Arch-devils. It's cool that they're back from the 1st edition D&D, but they made a separate prestige class for thralls of each one. They could have used the space for other prestige classes. The spells are good (or is that bad?) and nasty. The vile monsters aren't too vile, I'd say they're comparable to some of the freakier Ravenloft ones, with some really cool HR Geiger Alien-ish things. The art has lots of ... The rules for insanity and drug addiction don't look too bad. I was expecting a bit more variety (i.e., slavery, crimes etc), which was oddly missing, and it would have been cool to see fear, horror, and insanity check rules like in Ravenloft. Overall, I'd say that there are better sourcebooks for mature content ..."
5,Wonderful Finnish fairy tales.,Great for kids old and young! Tall and short too. Enjoy this fantastic escape from anything alike our normal worLd.
2,6th Grader's Review,"The Moomintrolls, small fictional animals, find a big black hat. They soon find out that the hat changes whatever is put in it. They go on many small adventures, making new friends and starting to figure out where the mysterious hat came from. Moomintroll is a young character, who goes on adventures with his friends and family, always eager to discover something new.I think that Finn Family Moomintroll wasn't very good. It didn't have much plot or theme. Characters would do this, do that, but everything always turned out the way they wanted. I didn't really understand what the characters were either. Most of them seemed to be different animals, but it never said what they were.One of the better qualities of the book is that it is short. It was a quick, easy read, and did not take very long. I would recommend this book to people looking for a quick, fictional book.Reviewer: Ellie"
2,waste of money and space,"my daugher is 15 months. rarely plays with it. if she does, it is for about a min. wouldn't recommend it."
4,Another great steering wheel toy,"This is a great toy for any child that likes things with steering wheels. My son has had hours of fun with it and at 30 months, he still plays with it. I would recommend this toy."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I was very excited upon recieving the V-Tech See Me Go! Driver. After spending 10 minutes slapping the horn, my one year old completely lost interest. Even sitting with her and showing her the cool things it did didn't help her interest. She will however bop her head to the music if I push the button for her. It is brightly colored with many different gadgets and lights and sounds which should make it a very appealing choice, just not for my young one."
5,baby loves her sleep sack,My baby loves her sleep sack-it keeps her warm and snuggly and let's her keep her arms free. I only wish they made one a bit lighter weight for warmer nights and naps.
4,Great Bargain Album,"This is a great bargain album for the 1980's melodic metal act. Although it could have included Tooth And Nail, the song selection is very good. And at a cool price. Alone Again was the band's biggest hit, reaching number 65 or something on the Billboard chart. This also includes the MTV favorite Dream Warriors from the Nightmare On Elm Street soundtrack. For a Dokken beginner, this is a best bet."
1,Waste of money,I bought this cable to go with the OBD II scanner I also bought at Amazon. It's supposed to allow you to get updates from the Internet. But when I went to Actron's website they reported online updates weren't available yet. So why did they sell me the cable?? Pretty expensive cable that has no use other than to fatten their coffers.
2,No reason to buy this cable!,"I bought this cable expecting an update from Actron. After reading the other reviews, I figured that after TWO years Actron would get their ACT together and release an update. However, I checked today and still no update. Why would you release a product that is useless for over 2 years!! The scanner works great, this cable is not worth buying unless they come out with an update. Save your money and invest it in a better Actron scanner."
5,Good Highchair Toy That Stays Stuck,"My seven-month-old has yet to unstick this toy - the suction cup works well. He enjoys spinning and twirling the pieces and listening to the noises the enclosed balls make. It's not the most captivating high chair toy I have seen, but it does its job and stays stuck well."
3,Prime Suspect 6,"I was dissatisfied with the way I received this movie this movie did not have a wrapper on it which makes you wonder if it was new like it stated. I have not watched it yet because I ordered the whole series and I do not want to watch it out of sequence. When I do I will write another review.For now I am not happy with my order and I am reluctant to accept the rest of my order. I read all the reviews on this company and they were positive but I do not have a positive review. The rest of my order said it was shipped and I have yet to receive the rest of it this has been 2 weeks now since they said it was shipped.AnnMilwaukee, Wi. USA"
4,Best of them all: Jane back to bring war criminal to justice,"I saw the 2nd part of this on Masterpiece Theater, and it's definitely the best of all 6. In this latest Prime Suspect Helen Mirren uncovers the murderer of 2 Bosnian refugees. The suspect turns out to be a Bosnia Serb war criminal, but is protected by the British government a la Szell in Marathon Man. Jane Tennison is older and wiser as she goes against orders to bring the mass killer turned smooth London professional to justice.The script writing is superior, even to the earlier episodes, as we get this psychological cat and mouse between Jane and the suspect, his wife, and his underling. And as part of the investigation Jane even travels to Bosnia and has the inevitable affair with her assistant. This shows the Bosnian war should not be forgotten and we've got to bring Mladic, Karadic, and the others to justice."
3,Ties up Some Loose Ends from Big Stone Gap,"It works as a sequel toBig Stone Gap: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)but I don't think it stands on its own.I liked it somewhat better than Big Stone Gap because the story line, while still romantic fantasy, was more realistic. The characters were still one dimensional, but the description of stress in marriage was good.I read this on a plane and the flight attendant (as well as my cousin who gave me the book) said thatLucia, Lucia: A Novelis the one to read."
4,"It's different, for sure, but good in its own right","I really loved Big Stone Gap, the first book in the trilogy, and looked forward to reading this one. However, I must warn readers that this book is not as light-hearted and fun as the first one. Ava Maria and Jack Mac have to deal with REAL LIFE problems, and though it all works out in the end, there are twists and surprises in it. I still loved the book, it's just not Big Stone Gap. I went on to read Milk Glass Moon as well, and it is also different from these two. Adriana Trigiani has quickly moved up to the top three on my list of favorite authors."
4,Ave Maria is back and better than ever.,"She's been married to Jack Mac for almost 10 years and a lot of water has passed under the bridge, some good and some not so good. We are faced with a fall from Grace on more than one front and the tantalizing aftermath.A wonderful study in the strength of marriage and the sadness that can permeate life after a tragedy takes a family hostage. Ave Maria takes herself and her daughter to Italy and there among her mothers family members she struggles with the things that she has kept buried deep inside.This is a wonderful book and I have to say I enjoyed it as much if not more than the first book. The author was kind enough to chat with our on-line book club and is as warm and honest in person as she comes across in her writing. I can't wait for her next book. Kelsana 12/21/01"
2,Why go there?,"I loved Big Stone Gap. I was eager to read the sequel. I was very disappointed; so cliche', so repetitive. It really lacked the fresh, involving soul-searching of Big Stone Gap. The characters seem to be dragged into a trite story-line which was oddly uncharacteristic. I wish the author had left the story alone."
4,funny and insightful,I loved Big Cherry Holler. It was interesting to see how the characters from Big Stone Gap had grown and changed. It was also astonishing how much Adriana has grown as a writer. I felt like I was part of the conversations. The author compassionately handles death of a child and infidelity. I thought the book was theraputic in dealing with these subjects. I laughed and I cried. Good story about everyday life and its ups and downs. I can't wait for the next book.
4,Life goes on...,"Following on from Big Stone Gap, part 2 of Trigiani's trilogy picks up Ave Maria's life 8 years after her marriage to Jack.Darker, sadder but more honest and insightful than Big Stone Gap, Big Cherry Holler faces up to the fact thata) life isn't always a bed of rosesb) people often screw up... but it doesn't have to be the end of the world when it happens.NB: I'd ordered this at the same time as Big Stone Gap, and enjoyed reading them back-to-back, while the characters and `history'of Big Stone Gap was still fresh in my mind."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I read this book all in one day. It simply just kept getting better and better. I would have loved a little more of the visit from Italy, because it didn't seem like Pete could ""fall in love"" with her in that short of time and then to find her just didn't have the backing that I think it should.Other than that, Milk Glass Moon is on my agenda today and I look forward to it! I wouldn't mind a book 4 either!!!"
3,Not as good as her other books,"Spent way too much time on the main couples marital problems. Not interesting, stick to the story. Trigiani's other books were much better. I enjoyed them."
3,Big Cherry Holler,"Have read Trigianni's later novels and they are much better. The Valentina novels are deeper and more relevent to me. Being of American Italian descent I enjoyed her description of Italy, and reading about strong, determined women."
2,A Marriage in the Doldrums,"Long time spinster Ave Maria Mulligan married Jack MacChesney in the far better novel Big Stone Gap. But, alas, the marriage has grown stale. Following the death of their second child the two find it increasingly difficut to communicate, or even to muster much concern for the other. The supporting cast of characters is so much more fun than the main characters that I have trouble mustering up much concern for Ave and Jack myself. The book comes alive when Ave and her daughter travel back to Italy-without Jack--to spend time with her family. Upon her return to Big Stone Gap she and Jack eventually effect a reconciliation. One hopes that it ""takes"" because another novel exploring their further marriage travails would be too, too much."
5,Way to go Adri!!!!!,"Having grown up in Big Stone Gap and having known Adri, I am just so proud!! After having read both Big Stone Gap and Big Cherry Holler, I can see that my pride is completely justified--not only is she a wonderful person, but an extremely talented author. Both books hook the reader with vivid characterizations and keep you there with intriquing plot lines. It's like revisiting the Big Stone Gap of my youth, so let me invite you to come on in and let Adri take you on an incredible journey to the lush hills of Southwest Virginia where everyone you meet can be a friend, and I promise you will want to return again and again."
2,A sad second.,"After reading Big Stone Gap I fell in love with the characters. Everytime I looked at the book it made me smile. But, after reading Big Cherry Holler, I just want to sell my book back to the book store. The characters are still wonderful, except they take certain roads in their life I would have rather not known about. The ending to Big Cherry Holler was also very disappointing, but I'm assuming that is because she will write another. I say just stick with Big Stone Gap and keep the love of the characters in your heart."
2,Choosing your destiny,"The second in the Big Stone Gap trilogy finds Ave Maria and Jack at a crossroads in their marriage. It's well plotted and all the familiar characters return, but something about this book rang hollow with me. I could read ""Big Stone Gap"" repeatedly and never tire of it; I read this once and never picked it up again."
4,Trig is Great,This book is well written and entertaining. I enjoy all her books that I have read so far. Will read more.
4,Big Cherry Holler,"A thoughtful, sometimes funny, sometimes sad story. The characters are compelling and engaging. A really good read and fun to read."
3,It's ok,"Nice bag, but it is MUCH smaller than a normal Bat Pack bag. Cant even fit his helmet in the bag. Barely fits 2 gloves. Can only caryy 1 bat."
2,"corolle Tidco Suce Pouce in pj's - 12"" doll","I purchased this doll for my Great Grand-daughter for christmas 2010. I was very disappointed as I was looking for a baby with real life skin and all for the bath tub with her. Guess I didnt read enough of the reviews because as soon as I saw it had a cloth body, I knew it was not what I wanted but too close to christmas to try to exchange it."
3,Baby Doll,"This doll looks just like my daughter. She's really adorable and we purchased the baby bottle, pacifer, and bib for her. My daughter likes to take the pacifier and bottle away from the doll and keep it for herself. It's really cute. The fact that the legs are not full legs, they are chopped off at the thighs, was odd to me. I have never purchased one of these dolls before by this maker, so I had no clue. The doll is cute for now, and is one of her buddies and we will have this for years to come."
2,"okay, but . . .","This is a cute doll, but much smaller than I thought it would be. The body is not the moulded plastic that I thought it would be, but rather a weird, waterproof bean body. I liked that it was life-like (more so than the cabbage patch my daughter already has), but the smell was over-powering when I opened the box. I much preferred the mild smell of the cabbage patch to the Corolle doll. I had bought this as a birthday gift for my almost 2 year old, but returned it and plan to either buy an additional cabbage patch doll or a circo brand doll like she has at grandma's house."
5,Wonderful toy for any child,I got this doll for my 2 year old granddaughter. She has many dolls but this one is now her favorite and she treats it just like a real baby. She enjoys that the doll can suck it's thumb. I am so glad that there is a doll out there that seems so well made. She is easy to cuddle for little hands.
4,Corolle Tidoo Baby,My daughter loves this doll. She takes it everywhere with her and the best part is the bath tub. My daughter used to put her other babies in the tub with her and it took hours to dry them out. With this baby it dries so quickly. The only problem I have with the doll is its price.
1,begone with ye,"Rehashed, warmed-over pop Wicca with an unappealing separatist slant. Went straight into my resale pile."
4,The pioneers of Smoke Coke Rock,Explosive... This debut effort is worth buying if you like Dinosaureous-toot-Punk-Metal-Crank-style-Riffs-o'plenty. You can smell the Candy in these grooves. Can you say: Sabbath-C-5? Stooge-Brains? Chrome Locust can & does. Raw like Iggy & Ozzy like it!
3,It Was Just OK ..........,"I had been looking forward to getting this season and seeing the gang again.I could tell from the first story that ""something"" was missing.I don't know if it is the difference in writers or if they just aren't givingit the same quality attention they did when they wrote Season 1, but I just didn'tfeel it was as good.I think leaving out the ""personal"" parts of the their lives hurt the stories as thatbroke up the seriousness of the stories. For me it gave it a good balance.Sandra and Jack seem much crankier than they usually are.........Just not as much fun to watch, but there were some good stories and those were the oneswith Brian and Esther.Hope Season 8 is better."
5,New Tricks,"I absolutely love the characters in this series. Each actor/actress portrays an individual much different than the others, and stays within that character as they all interact. They are good people in the series and you can trust them to remain true to their natures. They make me laugh. I would love to see more. So sorry to hear they were finished with the series!"
3,FATIGUE MANIFESTING ITSELF,Seven years is too long a period for any story-line to remain vigorous. The efforts was good as long as it lasted. It cannot last much longer.
5,LOVE THE NEWS TRICKS CAST,I LOVE NEW TRICKS STORY LINE AND ACTORS. THEY CONSTANTLY MAKE ME LAUGH. I LOOK FORWARD TO EVRY MONDAY NIGHT.EACH CHARACTER IS SPECIAL TO ME.
4,my input,"i enjoy the characters in the series and most of the story content. new tricks has humor, a wonderful camaraderie and often, some enlightenment into life's little mysteries."
3,"It is good, when standing alone.","I would greatly suggest this game to anyone I know. Definetly one of the best Football Games in the world, and I've played them all. You probably are wondering by now 'why the 3 stars then?' This is because, since I have played nearly all football games, I have seen this games master. I'm talking about nothing else, but NFL Madden 2003. Sure, the intro for Gameday is hella tight, and almost makes buying the game worth it. But, when compared to the almightly Madden, this game is nothing. This game is simpler, yet with much fewer choices. If you have this game, Warning: DON'T PLAY MADDEN OR YOU'LL NEVER HAVE FUN WITH GAMEDAY AGAIN! BE HAPPY WITH YOUR GAME AND LIVE LONG AND PROSPER!"
5,"Gripping work,vry smart &moral author, couldn't put it down!","An earlier reviewer said this work is somewhat ""polemic"" - it MUST be polemic to make its' point! Not for the faint of heart or trepidatious. This book is a MUST READ for all Real Americans who fear for our nation's future. Very nicely spiced up with germane quotations from some of the greatest Thinkers in history, and asides which reveal the authors profound autodidactic nature and inherent wisdom, bravery, morality and courage. BUY it and READ it NOW!!!!"
3,"Stick with the Gun Bible, you'll be glad you did","Better than different SHTF novel by Matthew BrackenEnemies Foreign and Domesticbut far from what I expected when I read the short teaser in Boston T Party's excellent guide to weaponcraft and preparednessBoston's Gun BibleHe makes excellent points in choosing Wyoming for the FSP instead of New Hampshire but the narrative reads like a choppy diary instead of a smooth prose. While I liked it enough to finnish it I would never loan it out to any fence-rider because it comes off as bit too preachy and contrived. The epilogue is definitely a bit rushed and maybe even too heavy with the warm & fuzzy ""we win in the end"" self-congratulation."
3,Corruptisima republica plurimae leges.,"First off this is not a true novel. It is a Libertarian reader with bits of novel thrown in. The quotes strung through out are very pertinent to the times we are living through now. This book will make you think, which makes it worth the read. I found myself agreeing in some places and shaking my head in others. If you want to read a book that promotes total freedom and self reliability this is for you. If you want to see that there is a alternative thought process then the current D and R craze that is sweeping the nation give it a read. If you want a EFAD style book you better look somewhere else."
2,hmmm...i dont know,"well this really wasnt what i expected it to be, it just didntcome accross as a story but more of a primer on politics andlegislative processs and rules, so it was really disappointingfor me. i guess reading j. rawles ""patriot"" was what i wasexpecting. The fact that it pertty much was done in a bloodlesscoup format didn't help me much either. i'm kinda sorryi bought this book for my patriot collection i had to readit twice as it also wasn't in a ""readable"" format that i amused too with ""what if"" stories.."
2,I wanted to like it...,"I really wanted to like this book. I have heard good things about the Author's other works, and as someone who majored in Political Science in college and is in the US Army, I figured it would be a good combination of my interests.The book was marred by multiple page length quotations from dry sources, attempting to (as far as I can tell) inject some sort of intellectual foundation into this work of fiction. The book suffered from way too much ""telling"" instead of ""showing"" and could have been about 100 pages shorter without losing any important content. If you cut out all the pull quotes, all the random asides, and the rest of the clutter it would be a really great book.I would give it one star, but since I liked it well enough to finish it, I guess it wasn't quite that bad."
5,A Must Read for free Americans,"What would happen if a bunch of freedom loving Americans concentrated in Wyoming, and transformed the state political system to favor liberty? Well, an intriguing and suspenseful story for one thing! Hint, the federal government doesn't take kindly to a state government respecting and enforcing the entire Bill of Rights. Halfway between a political/espionage thriller, and a historical novel with documentation, 'Molon Labe' is a great read. If you think liberty is in precious short supply in this great land of ours, you'll be cheering."
4,Good book with some flaws,"First let me say; I liked the book. It was worth reading for those who love freedom and love the intricacies of a good story.The asides, to deliver information or viewpoint, were sometimes distracting, but almost always interesting. I don't mind a stories flow being interrupted, but I do know it bothers some people, so be aware that if side trips bother you, this may not be the book for you.Overall, it was what I would rate as very good and I have no doubt that future efforts will be even better. I hope Mr. Royce continues writing."
2,bad reference book,"The book gives the solution to some heat conduction / mass diffusion problems. However, the book contains only the solutions of the basic cases of the conduction/diffusion. There are typing errors in some equations. The book is not well arranged and always not very clear (e.g., nomenclature is missing; in the chapter ""Diffusivity mechanisms"", even the explanation of the symbols in the text is not clear).I recommend the book of Carslaw, Jaeger: Conduction of heat in solids for people, who are looking for the mathematical solutions of the heat conduction equation for many special cases, or Bird, Stewart, Lightfoot: Transport phenomena for the people interesting more in engineering approach."
2,"Okay book, but there are better tools for learning CS2 out there.","This book, InDesign CS2 for Dummies is okay for a quick information look-up, but won't really help you learn to use the software. A better reference for learning to use InDesign CS2 is the book from Adobe Press: Adobe InDesign CS2 Classroom in a Book the official training workbook from Adobe Systems. It comes with a CD-ROM tutorial. Excellent!"
1,To bad,"I was really let down. This book struck me as a book written by a kid who is mad at the world. His priority shows to be nothing but money and yet he still seems like he is trying to fill something in his life.It saddens me, because it is a good school with good intentions yet the author of the book managed to really shed a negative light on the school. If I had read the book before becoming a student I would have thought twice. I hope that this book will not deter people from furthuring their education.I want to reiterate that the school is a great idea and I have been a very successful student. Please pay no attention to the book when chosing to advance you educational career."
4,Classic Dumb Humor,"If stupid things make you laugh, Andy Milonakis is a good choice. Most episodes of his show can be found online either through Spike or MTV2, but since I'm a big fan I wanted to own the DVDs."
1,I appreciate stupid...I love stupid...,"and this is just dumb. Stupid humor is hilarious...invader zim, oblongs, family guy. This is the most incredible waste of time ever. I've actually sat down and watched some of the episodes on TV, and this is just the epitome of everyone jackass related getting a tv show. No matter how undeserving or how utterly lacking in talent. He's a dimwit and a dumbass."
3,Nothing really side splitting,"Andy had a gray patch on the right side of his head. That's the only thing that looks old on him. His show is just a little to odd to follow. A few of the skits are funny here and there, but some just don't make much sense or are just to childish to be too amusing.Some of the skits are a little embarassing like his man-on-the-street trying to get people's reactions. Most just look at him like he's nuts. One guy even tells him to take his pill.It's an ok one time watch, but repeated viewing for me are not in the future."
5,the best show on tv,"You have to be the right kind of person to enjoy this show, but if you happen to laugh at everything silly like I do then this is the best show ever! I'm pre-ordering it because I cannot live without my ANDY MILONAKIS!!!"
5,Mid-20th century portrait technique masters,"About 100 full-page images and lots of smaller ones showing how to make the kind of portraits that the generation coming home from WWII had on the mantle or got published in Life or Look magazine. Between the diagram on every right page and the portrait on the left, any modern photographer could duplicate the shadow angles and intensity to get most of the way to the portrait style. The text of the interviews with the photographers gives some hints to the style of handling subjects to get the best results.The medium size (8.5 x 11 inches) book is just the right format to show a customer a type of portrait for their approval."
2,Using power cord no flip-out plug & longer charging time,"I wanted a compact charger with 100-240V worldwide voltage. My original preference was Sony BCG-34HD4. I was attracted by the word of 90-minute quick charger. Kind of regret after received the package:- It comes with a power cord. Not a flip-out plug like other compact charger.- It will NOT stop charging when you put a fully charged Battery in.- The charging time is much higher than 90-minute.From the user manual,NiMH AA 2100 mAh (1-2 batt. 105 min. & 3-4 batt. 230 min.)NiMH AA 1850 mAh (1-2 batt. 95 min. & 3-4 batt. 215 min.)NiMH AAA 750 mAh (1-2 batt. 145 min.)I experienced even higher charging time.Should buy Sony BCG-34HD4."
4,Impresive Look at Monsters around the World,"This production leads the viewer into the very real posibility of Cryptids around the planet. You don't get unrealistic hype, but a very sober look at animals curently unknown to science. Every cryptid has eyewitness acounts laid forward in a very matter of fact way. My favourite segment was the Austrailian ""Yowie"" (Bigfoot). Some very creepy moments in the retelling of some of these events. Recommended!"
1,"DISAPPOINTING, MONEY WASTER","ALL SEGMENTS JUST SHOWED ""INVESTIGATORS"" TRAVELING AROUND BUT NOT REALLY LOOKING/FINDING ANYTHING. REALLY BORING DVD. THE SHOW HAD BETTER SEGMENTS. REALLY,REALLY,REALLY DISAPPOINTING."
3,Book Review,I didn't care for this book. It was a book club selection for a Spirituality and Religions book club and I thought it was a poor choice.
1,horrible,"this game is a slap in the face for all of us who have stuck by ea sports. not only can you still put up a 150 points up on the bears using the texans , but now it seems they have just stop trying to impress our eyes as well. this game has not changed since the 2000 version and now 2003 looks worse than 2002. all this said though i can really only hate madden ea's ncaa football did improve and is by far the game to have for college ball, but if its nfl you want stick to nfl 2k3 or even fever.its hard to let madden go at first but dont keep being used by the ea sports team get a great game that trys to be better every year like madden used to do ."
2,sick of madden the name the game the graphics,Multi platform games [arent' good] and this is just another example of the same thing for the last 5 years of madden. Graphics are ok but not breathtaking. It seems the only thing that sells this game anymore is the name personally I think everyone should take a stand and quit buying this cookie cutter game. Let someone else show what they can do for a while like sega.
3,"Hey, its Madden!","I have been playing Madden since it came out for the Genesis so many years ago. I have always thought that Madden was the best football game until the 2K series came out to challenged it. I'll keep it short and sweet. Madden 2003 is really 2002 with mini camp, side-arm passes, gang tackles, faster running speed, Al Michaels, and on-line play (on PlayStation 2 only). I would have given this game a 4 star maybe even a 5 star if EA would have made some great improvements. If you have Madden 2002 stay away from this one. Not unless you have a PS2 and really want to go on-line with it. Dont get me wrong. Madden 2003 is a very good game, just nothing much new. It should have just been an add on! It probably took the developers 2 1/2 months to make. There is a better football game out there right now.............(2K3)"
5,Madden 2003,this is probalby the best madden series because the game play is much more easier than any other maddens available. this is a classic!!
3,Close but no cigar,"alright alright. i have madden 2003, and nfl fever 2003. My brother has madden 2003 for ps2, also. Ive played madden constantly, then one day i bought fever for xbox. Madden is great, don't get me wrong, but THERE ARE FLAWS THAT WILL ANNOY SIMULTANEOUSLY. Fever has flaws too, but nothing like madden's. defense in madden can be described in one word, worthless...unless it's on easy mode. fever's graphics are much better, and the animation is incredible. madden 2k3 is still an awesome game, but since i've played nfl fever, i have to give madden a 3/5."
4,"Very Good, Madden Rules","I enjoy this game better then 2002 because the game play is quicker the running backs and WR move much faster. I like the new features on 2003. The only draw back I notice was the graphics from 2002 is better, crisper. But overall Madden 2003 is still the best game out."
4,Strawberry Wig,"The wig is fun and was a hit at our local Strawberry Days festival. However, the wig came packaged in a small plastic sleeve and was frizzy and out of place in some parts. It was difficult to get the wig to look like it did in the photo on the website. It was much more wild and unkempt than the photo. But if you are looking for something silly and fun, this is the wig to have. Everyone loved it."
1,Waste of time....,This book is not worth the paper it is printed on. Maybe if one was high while reading it you might be able to make sense of it.
4,Much better than instant tapioca,"This product yields a much better pudding than instant/quick cook tapioca. The process takes about 30 minutes longer, but that is mostly idle time, allowing the tapioca to soak.I make my pudding with zero calorie stevia ([...]) and skim milk for a lower calorie version."
5,Yum!,"I never knew how good tapioca could be until I purchased and made this tapioca pudding! Now I'm ""hooked"". It does take longer that the fast-cook grocery store version, so you have time to read the mail while you are stirring it. You'll also have a few more pots and bowls to wash. But - hey - put on some good music."
5,great stuff!,"I know tapioca is sooo old fashioned, but when made with the real pearl kind, and much less sugar than suggested in any recipe...and maybe some coconut flakes & vanilla & almond flavoring - really good. Or make it & pour (preferably homemade)caramel on the top before chilling...it will come out something like Flan."
4,Monkey Puzzle - the pieces all fit!,"Why do people always feel the need to make foolish comparisons? Were they really expecting another ""Lights Out"" when they purchased this CD? If you enjoy rock n' roll and you're ""generally"" a UFO fan, you'll enjoy this CD.Take a look at a handful of these reviews and you'll notice that many of the reviewers are pointing out different favorites...and overall, the majority of songs are given praise. There's truly a lot of listening pleasure to be had here. Forget Schenker. He had his moment. If you listen to any of his solo stuff lately, you'll realize that Mogg and Way are much better off without him these days. If you're a true UFO fan, take a listen to ""Chocolate Box"" (Mogg/Way) and ""Dancing with St. Peter"" ($ign of 4) - both with guitarist Jeff Kollman - both fun and rockin' CD's. Nothing will (likely) ever equal the classics, but good rock and roll is not such a bad ""next-best"" thing. If you think you can't enjoy UFO without Schenker you're sadly mistaken."
4,Monkey Puzzle is actually pretty good,"Although this will never be a classic like Lights Out or Force It, the album is pretty good. I left it in the CD player in my truck for a couple of weeks and have to say that the tunes really grow on you.At first listen the CD was kind of generic, but after actually paying attention to the songs for awhile the album has become one of my recent favorites."
1,waste of my money,Sorry folks but this is the worst cd ufo has put out. I listened to it several times and not one song is memorable. Don't buy this it'll be a big let down. I can't write much about it 'cause there is nothing worthy to write about it. My recommendations for later ufo releases is Walk on water.........Covenant..........and Sharks as some folks have already pointed out. These last three are exceptional great rockers.
4,A promising start,"Dr. McGinley's book is a scholarly, reasoned, and balanced view of current Catholic teaching and actual pastoral practice regarding homosexuality, and the divergence and contradictions between the two. McGinley argues that people cannot be separated from their acts, particularly in the Catholic frame of reference, and so the ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" ethic is a total contradiction for the gay community.The bios he selects to make his points are a variety of styles and backgrounds, and richly descriptive of the humanity of their writers. This is not a sensational volume, and may prove to be a disappointment to those looking for a ""tell all"" type missive. It is thought-provoking, and will hopefully provide the jumping-off point for honest discussion among Catholics."
4,Excellent summary of the results of delving into New Age .,"It held my attention through twenty chapters. At midnight I collapsed into sleep...After breakfast, with my energy restored, the grace and beauty of his fulfillment sparkled through the final pages."
4,"SOCOM is fun ""on and off""line","I admit I bought this game because I needed something else to do online other that play Madden 2003, but I was surprised to find it was also fun offline. I began in one-player mission mode to learn the controls and to try the voice recognizion, neither on disappointed. The controls are easy to learn and the computer responds well to your commands. The missions are fun and they help you prepare for the online mode.Playing online is what this game is really all about. I was already in a game with 12 people with no slowdown. Below is my breakdown, but I would recommend this to people who want to see what PS2 online is all about.Sound - 10 - What can I say, voice recogniztion and online voice chat!Graphics - 8 - Smooth rendering in online mode, but backgrounds are generic in some levelsControls - 8 - They respond well enoughReplay - 10 - Online will keep you coming backOverall - 9 - A good game for PS2 owners, with or without the network adapter!"
1,Socom,Cosidering that I Paid all this money for Socom and the Network Adapter i can't even play this game. Where i live they do not have broadband. I did not know that SOCOM could only be played through broadband. So for you all that only have dial up do not buy this game.
5,The best - if you can connect,"This is by far the best game that sony has produced in my opinion. It is challenging in the single player missions, and the online gaming is exceptional. When connected to a surround sound system, you can hear the gun fire from all around you.I loved this game, until Christmas. I don't think Sony was prepared for the additional server load, and now I find it very difficult to get connected, and stay connected. It is very frustrating to have paid so much for this game, and now not be able to play online when I want to.I would not suggest that anyone buy this game if they want to play online. At least not until Sony communicates that they have rectofied their bandwidth issues and connecting is no longer and issue."
4,Time consuming,"If you're thinking about getting this game, be prepared for a game that takes much more than a dedicated weekend. This game takes a while to finish, but it's worth it. It is a lot of fun and it takes a whole lot of strategy. The online hook-up is also awesome with this game."
4,One of the best games to date,Ok now i see many games out there that arent worth the time of day SOCOM on the other hand is 1 of the hand full of games that are really good and will have u playing it for hours. Now i heard people talking about Tribes: Aerial Assault was better than socom. That's a bunch of nonsense. So far i haven't played online mode (which is why i didnt give it 5 stars yet)on either simply because im still waiting on the delivering of my PS2 network adapter. But as far as offline goes Socom is superb to many games out there. get 60$ and buy this game it will be worth it (60$ is cause it comes with a headset which lets u acually issue commands!)
2,"OK Single player, NOT OK Multiplayer","If you enjoy PC-style online FPS gaming, I would NOT reccomend this game. The online version is very poorly done.1) You cannot join in the middle of the game2) You only have 1 life3) You die very easily (like 2 shots)4) It is basically a bad deathmatch, no one goes for any of the objectives, so you just run around and kill eachother.Unfortunately, I havent had the chance to find a better alternative, so I would recommend to keep with PC FPS!"
5,terroist don't stand a chance,after i saw the reviews on a different website they have SOCOMUS NAVY SEALS a 9.4 over all which is great.. if you have broadband internet that's a plus if you don't you can play it online with dialup one fall back you can't use the headset..if you don't get it you'll miss out on all the action of beinga seal.. before it's to latethey're motto: the only easy day was yesterday
5,Holy ****,"This game is worthy [$$$] you can stab a guy in the neck,or rifle butt him< or just plain shoot him. ...there is really realistic guns and shells and best of all you can tell them what to do with the head sets they give you!..."
4,Great Game,"This game is amazing. The only bad thing is that when you play online the games are limited to 5 mins. That is the only problem I have, other than that I highly recommend it."
5,The BEST,This is the best game out for ps2. Online play is superior to any other game out there! It is a must have for ps2 owners!!
5,Buy it!,This game kicks so much [rear] its not even funny. Its so awesome its sick. You have to buy it! stop reading this and go buy it!
4,Yet Another Gory Game?,"He let himself be seen, how could that moronic boomer ever become a seal? Someone obviously felt sorry for him at the academy. For five times in a row, one plays the same level from the beginning, there are no ""checkpoints"" or other devices to make this game a little easier. To put it in plain terms, if you die, you die. So what does one do to prevent this from happening again? Simple. Shoot boomer in the head the first second that you gain control of the ""elite"" commander. Other than that monstrosity, the wonderful people at sony have come out with a deliciously delightful game. It is worth your time, trust me."
2,could of been better,"this game is really not that good, graphics could of been better, when your palying it's really difficult to move and shoot, ""i hate the controller configuration"" rent it don't buy it."
5,the best shooter of all time,"this game is one of my favorite games, i cant stop playing it. Even though i dont have online play the single player is still fun, i deffinately recomend this, and socom 2, even if you dont have online"
5,GREAT GAME!!!!,"This game was incredible!! Challenging, addicting and entertaining! Highly recommend this and Medal of Honor!"
1,Way to boring.....,"This game have bad grafics, stupid music, idiotic plot and they kill you each 5 seconds, this game sucks, and the real reason everybodie play it, is because its say's US navy seals."
4,man worth 1000stars,i got this game 3 days a go the 3rd level is pretty hard and your team can be dum sometimes want to hear something funny 1 time i told a teammate to throw a grenade at the enemy but instead he threw it right in the middle of my team and we all died and 1 time i told him to put a c-4 bomb on this weapons cache(something you gotta blowup on 2nd levl)and in return it gets planted on my back how nise i didnt know my birthday was today i thought my birth day was 1 day before i bought the game but dont think the game is bad from the grenade in the team or my birthday present that1day aftermy birthday just goesto show ya dont trust teamate spectra ohhh well after doing5 objectives in each level kill spectra trust me hell give you a late birthday present or early now open it up before ten seconds or die! but i played for hours of fun those were just two mistakes but theres a viris in my ps2 that cuased all this. bylee freeman.end transmission.
5,Awesome,"Ladys and gentleman this is the next james bond but better, b/c they're is the headset!!! i think this is the best game ever and you will to when you buy it. one bad thing wen you rent it the headset doesn't come with it but who cares the game is great!!! I rented this game at Block Buster and after that i was hooked the game deserves a 5 star rating. some ppl complain about the fact that you cant save after objectives are complete, but i don't that is the only bad thing about the game i can tell you i wont let it bring me down at all. and i hope you do the same dont waste your time renting the game go get it now!!!!!"
2,...and i was looking forward to this game,"i was disappointed with the gameplay and bad AI, i was hoping it was going to be like counter-strike, but you get killed after about 1 shot, i wish this game would have at least started with a decent first level, i cant believe i was going to buy this game, i'm glad everyone was sold out and was stuck renting it...i recommend renting it first"
5,Little Army That Could,"What a way to spice up the first person shooter but with the Navy Seals. This game offers alot from the headset to the graphics. Get everything from a hand grenade to the M-203 Grenade Launcher. Talk to your team with the headset and get through the mission alive.The game manages to trip up along the way to show what consequences the Seals have. You play the commander of another 3 other seals. Pick between 30 weapons like the M-16, MP5, and M203. The game is a Tom Clancy Rainbow Six all over again. Just a better all around game. If you are looking for the best first person shooter then this is the game you need. I give SOCOM:Navy Seals a 5 out of 5 stars."
5,great game!!!,"this game is definately worth the money!!!not only is the single player setup great, but the online playability makes it one of the best ps2 games i've played!"
5,The Best FPS Ever,FPS at the realest it could possibly be. No radar to cheat and know where everyone else is--much like the real world. Maximum hits to kill is typically around 4 or 5 (sometimes up to 7) with 1 hit as a head shot to kill--much like the real world. Real time communication with your team mates online for ultimate use of strategy--much like the real world.It doesn't get any more real or intense than this!
1,This game is horrible,"I don't know what it was about this game that made me dislike it so much. Oh wait, could it be the fact that it was boring, my teammates never did what I wanted them to do, the weapons were boring, and did I mention it was boring? Usually when I finish a game I am dissapointed and want more, but when this game ended I was relieved and promised myself that If there was ever a SOCOM II I would stay as far away as possible."
5,Excelent Game Worth Five Star,"Socom is the best game I have ever played. Great graphics,awesome firearms and weapons. In this game you protect America's FREEDOM by ruthless terrorist who TRY to defeat America. There are twelve exciting,deadly,heart pounding missions from being on a deadly ship to being in the middle of a jungle in the Twilands Socom has it all...dont rent Socom BUY IT!!!!"
5,Best Shooting Game Ever,"SOCOM U.S. Navy Seals is the best shooting game i have ever played. It has excellent graphics with the great amounts of details right down to the bullets that hit the rock wall. It's better than normal 1 player shooting games, you can command 3 other characters and still have the chance to play against other people around the world with the internet adapter."
4,This might help you for your Trainings into Seals,"This is the most awesome FPS game ever, I never stop loving it. It feels to me about how to command the team with teamwork, of course, I love teamwork, but not on the gym a few times unless there is many people. I am a Deaf Person and I made it without hearing it and the game makes me more smarter than Red Faction 2."
5,Experianced Gamer's Words...,"Ok, I've played alot of First Person Shooters and currently am hooked on Counter-Strike and Unreal Tournament 2k3. I played this game and I think it is a big step in the right direction for console online gaming. This is the first big step from any console to go into the online game. Online is the future of gaming, and this game is a masterpiece in the right direction! If you dont have this game, get it, and get the network adapter. Lots of people are already playing it, why not be one of them?"
5,Excellent online entertainment.,"If you're looking for relief from this war going on then buy SOCOM. It's a tactical online shooter that has a goofy twist to it, depending on who you play with. I's addiciting gameplay and online voice command is enough to make this a worth all 60 of your dollars, and even more if you really get into it."
4,Great title for a great price!,"I have always loved the Socom series, and the original is no exception! Great price for a solid game, definitely worth purchasing!"
5,"Mom, you better get this!","I played this over at my friends house. It ruled! You put on this headset and talk to other guys fighting on your own team. The graphics are incredible and the action is amzing!There are all these different lands that you get to fight in, and you have to follow orders and stuff. It was so real! I can't wait to get this game!"
4,This game Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is amazing. This is one of the best games I've have ever played in my day.Just imagine this game has over 30 weapons and you get a headset with it.When this game comes out I am going to get it and the online adapter with it.
3,busted!,"Don't you love how video game company employees post rave reviews of their own games all over the net way ahead of the release date as if they don't figure anybody will catch on?Come on guys, I'm an art director at a PC game company and I know how it works. Rather than insult people's intelligence, why not come right out and say ""Hi, I'm X from Y video game company, and I hope you really enjoy our game, Z. We've worked really hard to make a game that's A, B and C, and to include some new features we think you'll like like D and E, as well as some other things people have been asking for like F. If you like the game, please review it here and let people know what you think, thanks.""Although I have no idea how fun your game will be, you definitely have some very cool cover art, and for that you get a few stars. You're not fooling anybody with these reviews though, so why not just cut the nonsense and be upfront about things?"
3,Socom U.S Navy Seals was good but could be better!,"Socom was a cool game but could be better. The first day I brought this game home I was excited. I was thinking a game where you can talk to your commrads. After the first 3 levels it got boring because it was the same every level.The headset was an excilent part to the game but without it,it was another game like Max Payne. I did not like it much because it was a short and boring game. I thought it was more than 12 levels. It is an ok replay value game but after awilie it gets boring and easy. I beat it in like 3 days and only about 2 hrs. a day. All together this game was a dissapointment to me. If you like games with no replay value and very short then you would like this game."
4,Great record,"Solid, driving, pummeling, tight, huge guitar. Monolithic. This is the soundtrack to a medieval raid. Only problem is I can only take these guys in small doses. Some of the songs are a little too repetitive in an all instrumental format. If you are a fan of bands like Kyuss and the like definitely check these guys out."
4,karma to burn,"karma to burn are a 3 piece instrumental rock band from west virginia. i really dig the fact that they dont have a singer. there is way too much chatter in rock these days anyway. wild wonderful purgatory is a pretty straitforward rock album, drawing influence from zeppelin, sabbath, kiss, etc. this is good, classic rock n roll the way it should be played, which is sadly very rare these days. not much being released now days is going to be remembered. this may be an exception. it rocks hard."
5,Beautiful Anklet!!,This is an absolutely gorgeous ankle bracelet. I love mine so much I don't want to take it off!
3,One more DVD RipOff !!!,"Why Oh Why- When we pay good=hard to get money for a great film like LAWMAN do we get a cut & butchered copy w/ many minutes missing-this is dim & we all are being RIPPED Big Time by the powers that be!!! Still a great movie & I did order it= but it is not the same film that I saw years ago at a cinema in my hometown of Glendale Ca,I'm really disappointed about the scene w/Burt & miss North in bed- the film I saw then showed her good looking breasts,but the DVD I received from AMAZON has those covered w/a sheet! that along w/all the other cut outs OMG we all are getting RIPPED.Lawman (1971) [VHS]"
4,Lancaster Calls the Shots,"""Lawman"" (1971) features Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan at the top of their game in this decidedly nontraditional Western. Both stars are surrounded by an excellent supporting cast (notably Lee J. Cobb, Sheree North and Joseph Wiseman) and striking Mexican locations. Director Michael Winner gets carried away with the zoom shots, but the contemporary style works in the film's favor. A genuine sleeper that predates the postmodernity of Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven."""
2,Lawman Remake,"The original release of this film starring Burt Lancaster as the relentless alpha male and Sheree North as his attractive erstwhile lover contained an explicit bedroom scene which revealed more of the latter's earthy charms than seen in the recent remake. While the latter shows better on the screen--the original film is rough and worn through aging--the deleting of such racy images detracts from the film maker's artistic intent. Perhaps the new edition's editors expect to gain a broader audience by not offending puritancal tastes, but for me it's a disappointment. Specially since it's the only film I've ever seen of Sheree North topless (fortunately the original shows occasionally on cable t.v.). While such gratuitous editing occurs frequently on network television, one wouldn't expect it to happen on a DVD. This viewer certainly wouldn't have bought it had he known it had been cut."
1,Good flick. Lousy sound.,"No matter my inclinations towards Lancaster and his no nonsense duty and honor, the movie was not at all enjoyable due to the lousy sound--I've heard better in downstair closets filled with 20 years of dust. What went wrong?"
2,Unbelievable,The movie was unbelievable for two reasons:There actually were few gunfights in the Old West.Nobody but Burt could shoot straight.Should have called it Low Noon.
4,A really good western; but one caution,"This movie remains one of my favorite westerns and Burt Lancaster is excellent as the lawman who won't be bought off or scared off. The entire cast is excellent with Lee J. Cobb, Robert Ryan and lots of familiar faces.The ending has been criticized and I don't find it entirely satisfying. If the ending made more sense to me this movie would get a 5-star rating.The DVD lacks any real extras but the picture and sound are really good.The one caution I would give is that this DVD does NOT have any nudity by Sheree North. I know that the Bare Facts Video Guide says she is topless in this film, and I have a tape of the movie from a television airing that contains the footage. But in this version that scene, although still in the film, is an alternate take with a sheet pulled up and no nudity. Just in case anybody was interested.This is movie worth having on DVD."
5,Excellent!,Secured and very nice look. Unfortunately sold the car. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20.
2,"Great Artist, Poor recordings","It is sad to listen to this poor quality recording of Peter Cetera live in Salt Lake.I wonder if he did listen to this cd because if he did, he would fire his sound-crew immediately. Because the songs supported by the symphony orchestra are special and well performed, it is a shame that this product is sold. And even a bigger shame on Peter Cetera who's recordings normally have a 5 star rating.Sorry Peter.Rogier from The Netherlands.(or is it possible that this cd has been dubbed in the wrong way..?)"
4,The Way Time Feels on Metal,"This work is a record of a period of life spent in the presence of an object-a crystal which, writes Coolidge, ""has thirteen facets"" (as Coolidge's name has thirteen letters)and which comes to dominate Coolidge's reflections. Coolidge writes with humor and authority, and the verse evokes, at various times, a scientific investigation, a Kerouac-influenced stream of consciousness, and an absurdist collage. An excellent example of how contemporary poetry can remain vital by drawing inspiration from unlikely sources."
4,Getting in shape,"Joyce is such a hoot, she makes working out fun. I wasn't sure I would like to the pyramid approach but love it. It is flexible and any size of weights can be used. Adjustments to Increase weight can be made easily to continue receiving a challenging workout. I have purchased several of her DVD's to vary my workouts."
4,Good factory replacement pedals,"Bought these pedals as a replacement to my diamondback outlook mountain bike. They are exactly the same pedals that came with the bike. These are perfect for what I need them for, economical, sturdy, and does what it needs to do. Easy to install, done in a matter of minutes. Would recommend to others."
1,Worst book on Aikido I ever saw,"This is probably the worst book about aikido I have ever read. It does not contain any useful information, and the title are highly misleading. The authour seems to be on a ego-trip enjoying his own pictures, but I surely did not. If you are looking for a good book, I strongly recommend to keep looking because there are plenty of good books out there. This is not one of them."
5,Great book!,"This an a fantastically written yet heartbreaking story of a mother's quest for justice in her daughters murder. I have read this book several times, and each time I am drawn in. Excellent read."
5,Scary,I'm almost finished this book and only started it yesterday. A sad and scary story written by a well known writer about the shooting of her youngest child. It's a thriller as well and keeps you wondering what next! I have to say this is on my best books list. I'm hoping they find the murderers but there are so many different twists that I still don't know what to expect. I would recommend this book to people who like true life thrillers.
1,Misleading,Writer is obsessed with physic readings that are painful to read through. If there wasn't anymore facts to the case. Wrap it up or at least talk more about the viictim so we can get some insight to her personality. Include pictures.
4,the by,"the story begins when lois Duncan, a popular, daughter Kait walks in and greets her parents. She said that her boyfriend got in to a few fights and and refuses to leave her apartment. Later she is found in the dead in her car. there was one eye wittnes. he was a truck driver. at the end of the story they never found the ki"
2,*meh* I didn't see the appeal,"I feel bad for the mother and the story itself is very interesting, but its dependence on ham-handed psychic readings was a pretty big turn off. I admire the mother's chutzpah but her investigative techniques are far cry from those displayed in Graysmith's far superior Zodiac."
2,Left me Frustrated,"This book started off really good. In fact, I couldn't put it down. But then all the psychic readings stuff....snoresville. All of that could've been left out. Also I was very frustrated that this book ended with no answers. I felt like there was no closure. All in all, it was an ok read, but I skipped a LOT of stuff towards the end."
2,Unfinished.,"I stayed up until 2:00am to find out the conclusion to all the mysteries only to find that Duncan stopped writing before the story ended. Overall, a good piece of non-fiction for a fiction writer. Next time please have the patience for the story to play out before ending it."
1,Well written but meaningless,"Found my 12 year-old daughter reading this so my Wife read it also. Well written for the intended audience but absolutely full of channeling and past life stuff.If you're a parent concerened with ideas of past life regression, chanelling and other mystic junk portrayed as *fact* (with some biblical attribution to make it sound ""offcial"" thrown in..) then please be aware of what your child is reading when they pick up this book. If they read it you must also - if only to explain what's wrong with the ""facts"" in the book."
3,very touching but frustrating,"I was very touched by the honesty and pain that Lois so clearly wrote with. I am very frustrated that no one has been brought to justice over the murder of her daughter, I give Lois alot of credit for her strength."
2,too much psychics!,"I read a lot of murder investigations, but this book makes me very uncomfortable because its constant reference to visions, psychics, religion to a high degree, and reincarnation. To such an extend that it becomes quickly irritating. Some of the things the author writes about are totally unbelievable, such as her ability to see into the future. All in all, I felt after having read this to have been wasting my time and will switch straight away to Ann Rule."
5,Awesome and Heartbreaking Story,"This is one of the best non fiction books I have ever read. It is a real tear jerker. I would definately recommend it if you love a good mystery book. Also,I definately disagree with the well written but meaningless review comment. It is not meaningless and the facts are real. I am 13 and I would definately allow my child to read it if I were older. It is a good book."
5,Excellent Product for the Price,"The phone is fantastic. Features included as great (Answering machine, speaker phone, 5.8 GHz, Caller ID and what not!) Its an excellent product for the price offered at Amazon. I always prefer to purchase products at amazon."
4,Tangie from The Tangerine Bear movie,"Our son became interested in the movie, ""The Tangerine Bear, Home for Christmas"" this year and wanted a bear for Christmas. After searching, this TY Bear was the closest I could come to finding Tangie (The Tangerine Bear). I think TY made this bear to be like the one from that movie, but he's missing one key feature- he is missing the upside down smile that Tangie wore (the basis for e movie)"
3,Completely impersonal biography,"I've never seen a biography that contained less personal information about its subject. This DVD, for example, never mentions Balanchine's marriages to the dancers Maria Tallchief and Tanquil leClerc, or his obsession with the forty-years-younger Suzanne Farrell. These relationships are important for more than just gossipy reasons - all three women had a significant effect on his work. There are some good performance clips on the DVD, but the selection is oddly biased: lots and lots of Peter Martins, but never a glimpse of Edward Villella. A fine ""starter CD"" for those just learning about Balanchine, but frustrating for fans."
4,Quality Sounds,Compared to other FX CD's - this one sounds extremely good and is an overall good sampler.... Worth every penny!
5,Great Sound F/X CD!,Has a great list of sound F/X. You can't go wrong at this price. The gun shot F/X are great.
4,The Underdogs..,"Its about time that an independent magazine shows us that there are other artists out there and other artists we should look for. If you havent picked up the magazine, get it. It's based out of toronto but has worldwide appeal because its not a toronto or canadian content based magazine. They of course shine light on their own - but it has appeal to all - thats why they have US and Europe distribution now.. congrats and I look forward to more issues - www.urbanology.com for more!!"
1,ugly,"flat print only, cheap version, no nice colours, no beautiful gem stylereally disappointing, make yourself own ones and save money"
4,Manual for this watch,If you need instructions for this watch go to tha Casio site and selectmodule #4756. It is a pdf file you can download and print. Took me a whileto find it.
3,"Wanted to love it, but eh.","I'm a fan of Miss Kittin and had heard a couple of things from Fdh that I enjoyed. I figured this album couldn't miss. Unfortunately, I listed to the whole thing and I was bored. None of the songs really got my attention and I had to keeping checking the cd to make sure it wasn't the same song. It's not a horrible cd, but it won't rock your world."
2,Waste of Money..,"I was really looking forward to play this game, but I am really disappointed now. First, I personally do not like Madden-style up and down field mode. Nonetheless, I'm glad I only paid $ for this game.PS I would really want to see Tecmo bring back Tecmo Super Bowl (SNES Version) to Gameboy Advance. Tecmo Super Bowl is the best football game ever!"
2,this is a poor excuse for a madden game,"I hate this game and if your a madden freak you might get it forcolletion but not for fun.it:boring,no fun at all.but all in allthe best thing is the create-a-player thats it.If you know madden,this madden game looks like madden 1996 on SNES.i am going to tell you the pro's and con's for you can understand.PRO'S:Create-a-player is great but not that all greatGot all teams even all maddenbut i got to give them credict..they try to give them a cool inzone daneits got link play action..2p actionCON'S:game play sucks like hell...thats right i said helli told you about the grahics it look like 1996 maddengets boring real quick i..mean quickwell thats all about this stupid game.Im telling the truth i gotthis game by mistake..i well speak the truth."
5,best book on animal liberation,"After anyone reads this book they will look at radicals with logic, reason, and a compassionate heart. This book, more then any other animal rights book from Animal Liberation by Singer or The Case for Animal Rights by Regan, stands far above them all. While at the same time all of those books are outstanding and must be read. The anthology approach of gathering many people together to write on an important topic should be done on all critical topics, bravo Best and Nocella. I now know so much more about different viewpoints and a strong stance to debate the use of direct action."
4,GO ALF!,This book did more to get me modivated then any other book I've read. It is well writen and it's nice to hear different prospectives of opinion while not losing sight of animal rights. Awesome.
3,Expands my pea sized mind to the size of a walnut,"I bought this for a dollar in a ""used, no one wants these"" type bin in a record store in Philadelphia many years ago. It was some kind of imported Canadian copy. I'm not sure why I have it, or why I am reviewing it. I like dub music, but this isn't really dub in the true sense- very little analog manipulation, reverb, or the usual Lee Perry/ S+R type tricks- in fact it sounds like a drum machine/ casio attempt to nearly mock the genre. However, I put it on sometimes for a laugh in a party full of people off their heads and see if anyone catches on or comments. It unleashes the swirling colors of repetition upon a fragile consciousness that is imploding to nowhere. HAHAHAHA."
3,Nice - but could be better.,"The set is quite pretty and very well made; but I am unable to give it 5 stars because the only claim it has to being a set is the stone cut and setting similarity. Ie: the pendant stone color is the lovely dark amethyst purple shown in the picture, and the earrings are so much lighter in color that, if not for the same cut of the stone and settings, they wouldn't even look like a set at all. For the $19.99 price I got them at as a Gold Box deal, I guess I shouldn't complain; but the difference between the pendant stone and earring stones is VERY noticeable. Bottom line; I'm quite happy with the pendant - but not with the earrings; which I should also remark on as having some of the longest posts I have ever seen."
4,A little small,"These were a little smaller then I had expected, but for the cost I would not complain."
1,Haven't received this yet,I'd like to know where this is. I haven't received it yet. It's been a month.
4,I loved The Shining and A Clockswork Orange...,"I love two films the other one is very strange but is also nice, the three movies come on individual blu-rays discs but on the same box... the item description is wrong this is a 3 discs box not a single disc with 3 movies."
3,"Good films, Nice Quality","Format is good for these 3 films. Every history has the Kubrick sign. Good image quality and sound quality is good, but could be better, in order to maximize the performance in Hi-Fi home cinemas. But for the cost is pretty good. Subtitles spanish available."
4,Good value,"Yeah, the set is pretty bare-bones, but you're getting three fantastic films for $10 (at least that was the price when I ordered it). Knocked off a star because the teeth that hold the central disc holder broke the first time I opened the case."
2,Very poor copy. Not a digital remaster.,"Three of the best movies of all time in one convenient package. What could be wrong with that?I'll tell you.This is not a digital remaster. The films appear to have been copied directly from the original film to Bluray, with absolutely no cleanup or remastering. So the sound is terrible; the video contains abrasion marks and other defects from the original film roll. I'm very disappointed they didn't at least cleanup the digital copy before selling the Bluray. You might as well be watching the films on VHS tape."
3,Disappointment ensues...,"This triple feature would have been great if it had "" Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, and Clockwork Orange. I hat 2001, slowest damn movie, and boring. Why does Warner have to screw with things?"
1,Not just more of Forde from different sources,"After reading all of Gerharde Forde's books at least twice, some as many as six times, I was anticipating reading other men with a similar perspective on the gosdpel of the grace of God who had been affected by his ministry. With very few exceptions, I was severely disappointed. They are either men coming from a different perspective or they did not learn their lessons well. If you are anticipating more of Forde from other sources you will be disapponted as well. However, if you are looking for a wide range of perspectives on what Forde preached, though not necessarily with a similar understanding, then you may appreciate the book, as the men are well-recognized scholars. I'm going to try to sell mine."
5,Great stripped-down rock'n'roll,"This is one of those albums that just creeps up on you and takes over your soul. On first listen, it may not seem that special. The production is raw, the musicianship is rough-hewn and the vocals are nothing spectacular.Then why does it end up being one of my favorite albums of the past two years? Because these two women have rock'n'roll pumping through their veins at full force. Drawing on all the right influences (delta blues, 60's garage rock, PJ Harvey, Mazzy Star, the Cramps and possibly the White Stripes), Mr. Airplane Man have created a near-flawless chunk of soul-drenched, attitudinal rock. It's deceptively simple, but after a few listens I was hooked.This is not mainstream or slick in any way. It's for those of us who value soul over studio sheen, and true emotion over calculated theatrics. If you dig the aforementioned acts, you stand a good chance of liking Mr. Airplane Man. Give it a listen."
5,who says guitar heroes are dead?,"ed mundell totally outdoes all his work with monster magnet(which i never really dug anyway)the best recreation of 70's heavy rock ever created.the heaviness is everything you want in your metal but never seem to receive.i especially appreciate the tommy bolin tune,he has been one of my heroes for years.screw kyuss and all the rest-this is the real deal!"
3,Not what I expected from the reviews I read,"This album is not as great as everyone would have you believe. 5 stars? C'mon. It's good, it's rockin', it's groovy and all that but, the album kind of sounds like one long song to me. My favorites were the straight ahead, simpler rockin' tunes. Some of the tunes get a little too ""jammy"" and kind of don't go anywhere or sound a little too classic rock. They even attempt to blatantly rip off Santana on one tune. Would be better if a little heavier."
2,Atomic Bitchwax - Please Don't waste your money!,"I am a big fan of ""stoner rock"" and I play guitar. I gave this CD a chance to WOW me but I was almost disgusted. Lyrics are non poetic and almost painfull to listen to and Guitar riffs are stolen from 80's rock bands and uninspired. I don't mean to plug other bands in this review but If you want a true rock experience by any CLUTCH album, they put this band to shame!! Don't let the other reviews fool you this album is a 2 out of 5 at best."
5,This album makes Limp Bizkit and Korn look even MORE weak!!!,"The drums are phenomenal, the guitars are totally downtown 1971 . . . the bass is straight up supergroovy Sabbath with MORE GROOVE . . . . vocals are rockin' . . . what do you want? Opera?? No way you freakies . . . .this album scrapes all the other 90's bands off the bottom of its' shoes! Buy this if you are tired of all the MTV substitutes for ROCK. Rock ain't even close to dead . . . you just need to get on some Atomic Bitchwax right now . . . . DO IT. . . if you don't like this album . . . email me and I will give you back your money! I ain't worried though . . . you will have to scrape yourself off of the floor just to press play again. Now shut up and get it."
5,Unbelievable album...,"If you're a musician, this is one of those albums that makes you want to throw in the towel after you hear it. It's perfect, in every single way. Anyone who's seen these guys plays in Jersey over the past several years knows what I mean. The musicianship -- especially the drumming, which is absolutely mind-blowing, like Moon and Mitchell rolled into one, times one thousand -- is beyond incredible. A total heavy rock classic."
5,Amazingly Beautiful and Educational !!!,"The film is a lovely combination of education and art! i learned a lot from the candid way the women in the film speak about their sexuality, and enjoyed the beautiful erotic scenes. Please note-this film does contain explicit adult content! You will see real women ejaculating...it will definately make a believer out of any skeptic."
1,don't believe the hype,"This video is supposed to be about female ejaculation through the g-spot, but it seemed all the females here had them through clitoral stimulation with very little g-spot stimulation, was I the only one that noticed that?And the actresses were not very attractive and I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know. I have a feeling that all these positive reviews were left by people who produced the film. So do yourself a favor and skip this one, it's not worth it."
3,"Useful for initiation, but not more","Well, if you have never heard about female ejaculation, you'd probably find this product useful. Otherwise, there is no much techniques explained. Also, it's a matter of taste, but I do not find the actors particularly young and attractive, to say the least..."
5,FROM THE PUBLISHER:,"This is an examination of the foundation texts of socialism. It cites decades of ""sloppy scholarship and deliberate censorship"" and links socialism to conservative, racist and genocidal ideas. Drawing on sources from Robert Owen to Ken Livingstone, the author asserts that socialism was a conservative, nostalgic reaction to the radicalism of capitalism, and not always supposed to be advantagous to the poor. Two chapters study Hitler's claim that ""the whole of National Socialism"" was based on Marx, and bring to light the common theoretical basis of the beliefs of Stalin and Hitler which led to the death camps."
2,IP5,Didn't care for this movie because it made no sense and did not have a good storyline. You are left wondering what are they doing and what is it really about. The only good thing about this movie is it has Olivier Martinez in it. He's a great actor and should not be in this movie.
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","From what started out as rare and interesting, 5 minutes in it was bad quality video trasfer, borrowing heavily from previous dvd releases and basically a waste of money. Pity. The blurb says footage never previously available on DVD which is misleading and basically not true.Mark"
4,Yessongs is a great live recording of Yes at its best..,"I'm a big Yes fan since the early 70s, the video of a concert during 1973 is excellant especially the guitar work of Steve Howe, he improvised quite often from the regular playing on CDs, I was even more impressed with him than before. A must for Yes fans!"
1,Don't Get Misled....,"Although Roger Dean's artwork on the cover of this DVD may evoke some nostalgia in many Yes fans, don't be lured into parting with your money for this one. The quality of the sound is terrible, and the video looks almost like a home-movie. None of the atmosphere of the Rainbow Rooms is captured and the whole experience left me thinking I should have read some reviews before buying! Put on your Yes CD's and close your eyes - trust me, you'll have a better experience."
5,A Progressive Gem,"Everything in this video is perfect: the songs, the performance of the musicians, the sweet voice of Jon Anderson. If I had the chance to take a trip around the universe to not come back anymore, certainly I'd take Yessongs to listen in my spaceship everyday. A real gem."
1,Sound Quality Unacceptable,"The sound quality is the same as VHS before the days of Hi-Fi which is totally unacceptable. Otherwise it would have been a great documentary of Yes in the ""Golden Era"" of rock. I had to return it."
1,If the sound was good it wouldn't matter -- but ...,"I've been a long fan of Yes. Steve Howe is one of the greatest guitar players ever, however, this DVD sounds TERRIBLE! I acutally went and re-checked my wirering to make sure something wasn't wrong. The video is not good either. The camera is out of focus or SOMETHING! Too bad. This is Yes at their prime. For you guitar players, it's worth it just to watch the master at work. But for everyone else -- don't buy it -"
2,"GOOD CONCERT, BAD SOUND QUALITY","You could see the YESSONGS movie in the cinemas, I believe it was 1976, and it had better sound and more tracks as the video a couple of years later. Why, Oh Why is it not possible to make a good video and DVD of this movie. They can get Elvis on stage again nowadays but it's probably to difficult in the age of computers to remaster and to digitalise this beautiful concert. Oh, it would be so nice to relive this concert again and with good sound quality!! Well, I'm still hoping that day will come."
1,How could this be released ?,"I waited a long time to buy this and it was going to be a treasure as I had seen the band live many times in their early years, including their Marquee residence every Tuesday night (entry fee approx $1 or 6/6d in English currency). What a disappointing video and the sound is not much better. Having recently purchased Keys to Ascension and appreciated the quality of production, I was amazed a band with such integrity would allow this third rate DVD to be released. Come on now, lets get the band on a soundstage like Eagles, Mac and Fogerty and showcase the excellent musicanship that they are still capable of. It will be a winner. As for Yessongs, I would save your money. In fact it was so poor I traded this DVD in, it simply was depressing to watch given the memories I had of watching this band."
2,i was disappointed...,"i know it's only the early seventies, but the audio, video, and production were not good. this should NOT have ever been put on dvd. what a waste..."
3,YesSongs versus Keys,"If this was to be the same as the Album, I think this would be a video to remember. Although the songs and pics are great, I do feel this video is put together in a hurry. No comparission with The Song Remains the Same for example, from that other Atlantic band. Or to their later Keys to Ascension. For YesFans a must. For music lovers a posible hit, but more likely a miss"
2,Yessongs - An Album & Movie Willfully Neglected,"We all can bet that contractual blither-blather is holding back a proper redoing of this film and it's album. Brian Lane, I'm guessing. Otherwise this tripe quality of such great material wouldn't have been released. Ragged print - what a joke. Looks like a VHS transfer from some 3rd generation film after gathering dust for the past twenty five years."
5,Yes to Yessongs,This is classic '70s Yes and it's great to visualize the album.An absolute highlight is witnessing Steve Howe's guitar mastery and 'other worldly' abitlities on The Clap.The whole thing is a 'trip' for the senses and the memories!The recording and colour are great - you won't be disappointed.
2,Yes - Yessongs DVD,"Back in 1972, the progressive band Yes was in their infancy and with an original line-up of Steve Howe, Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Rick Wakeman and Alan White played most of their songs from the Fragile and Close to the Edge albums. Video quality is poor and grainy as befitting that era and sound is even poorer in PCM stereo. Only for hardcore Yes fans. The more recent Tales of the Tsongas DVD is a much better alternative with the same line-up."
1,"Yes, it's awful","Yes is one of my faverate 70's bands, this was really a dissapointment. Quality is horrable"
3,"Bad Cameraman, bad special effects, but good music.","The problem was (and it is now sometimes) that who has the camera does not know the music, when Steve is playing, the camera take Chris, the special effects showing stupid things instead the show, are so bad, I think the director never thought about the documental value of the film in the future.The editorial says that the dvd was taken from a bad copy of a 16 mm film, where is the original? I can not believe that they don't couldn't it.I think the show is not complete ~70 min. But anyway it is a good dvd if you like to see Yes in December 1972.Yessong it is not Steve Howe, ... is from Yes.you can not found it easy serching for yes dvds.Also the Editorial says that it is one of the two discs available, it is not correct, there is a complete show (2 dvd) Yes / Live 1975 at QPR (Japan I think)NTSC DVD Region 0, you can play it anywhere.... The sonund is not too good, but it is Yes."
1,"YESSONGS, not worth it-","POOR QUALITY, DARK, GRAINY VERY POOR, POOR SOUND, DEFINATELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY, WOULD SEND BACK IF NOT FOR THE HASSLES INVOLVED-"
4,"The Music is STELLAR, but....","If you're a fan of the music or the album, the DVD is worthwhile.Unfortunately, the photography and the editing look like they were done by a drunken high school student.When Steve Howe is flying through Yours is No Disgrace, we get to see Chris Squire's boots. Also featured are several close-ups of Rick Wakeman's sequins. Not to mention the overdone, smeared out effects which produce spiffy colours and little else.Hard to tell that Alan White was part of the band from the movie.One can only hope (pray, actually) that the original film is in a locker somewhere, waiting to be re-edited by someone who understands the usefulness of split-screen when presenting a band of virtuosos.Mr. Howe??? Please protect your legacy. Arrange for a proper edit of this wonderful concert. I'd buy it again, if I could actually watch you play."
2,I don't feel I got my moneys worth for this book!!,"This book is not for the novice, it is more for the advanced retailer. It was vague in a few places and I didn't understand where the writer was headed. Very disappointed."
1,Disppointed,"The only good thing about this chair is it's color. It has an absolutely ill fitted cushion seat that keeps sliding up from the back and then out every time someone sits on it, especially if they sit on the edge. The springs at the bottom are higher in the center part of the chair than in the front or back therefore the cushion is not snuggly fit in the chair which is awfully bothersome. I have inserted an anti slip mat underneath but it kind of doesn't work."
5,"Great item, great price","Great price for these glasses. I looked elsewhere online, and they were much more expensive. Can't wait to use them. The rhinestones look awesome."
4,A Great First Novel,"Sandy Santisteven's first novel, Song of the Cicada, is strangely captivating. From the first page the reader is drawn into a world of the past, a tuberculosis sanitarium set in the desert of Southern California. The images conveyed by the author give the reader a feeling of being the proverbial fly on the wall as we watch the characters move about in their daily lives. The continuous descriptive flow, with little actual dialog, caused me to want to absorb every word, rather than skim through quickly. I look forward to more from this new author."
5,A delightful read.,"This book 'Zee s Not scared' will entertain, inform and comfort all at the same time. Page after page will find us following the little zebra as he tries to capture his parents attention - even though he should be sleeping..... Some scary events later the little zebra emerges perhaps more grown up than he wished as he finds himself comforting his parents.This is the kind of book which will be read over and over again."
3,"Reggae = yes, Movie = no","I enjoyed this film more in the theatre (better sound). As I viewed it again, it's pretty boring. There's no dialog. It's not even a movie really. It's just concert footage. The Mystic Revealers are especially boring. I wish it featured more Luciano, and Garnett Silk..."
1,They call this reggae?,"Unfortunately, this is not true roots reggae, nor dub. This DVD contains some of the hollowest sounding pop-reggae performances ever made. A waste of time."
5,Great Ideas,"The project ideas in this book are excellent. There are a wide variety of experiments, theme gardens, recipes for the harvest, etc. for both indoor and outdoor gardening.Some of the suggestions for what to grow are a bit out-of-date, but the descriptions of what to look for are such that one could easily substitute the variety in the book for a more current one.This book has been great for finding things to do with 4-H'ers, school kids, daycare kids, etc. It is very well done."
2,Edited copy.,"CRUEL WORLD was a great movie because it dealt with a boy (Edward Furlong) whose low popularity pushed him to the edge, so he decided to do something, violent and life-ending, about it. Which doesn't sound right unless you've been in the bullied kid's shoes before. This kind of thing may go through someone's mind, but this movie shows what happens when the line between fantasy and reality blur and everything falls apart.Why 2 stars then, if it does such a great job? Because the original, with a well deserved NC-17 Rating, did a great job. For whatever reason the company chose to only re-release the terrible R Rated cut on blu-ray, in which less than 33% of the story is even TOLD, let alone depicted. It's a terrible let-down."
1,Couldn't believe it.,This case arrived with the opening end completly severed from the rest of the case!!!????? What can I say???? It was returned.
2,Door flap on PRO model broke on first airline trip,"Flambeau Outdoors Bazuka Pro Rod CaseI fly to Mexico at least once a year. I have had many trips with decent results using Flambeau rod cases. However after a recent trip my case got damaged by the airline, and I decided to spend the extra cash for the larger PRO model. The door flap broke on first trip and the rods got damaged as the door opened and rods slid out. Also broken was the steel locking fastener? I am now thinking of going with the Plano cases?"
1,Didn't make the maiden voyage,I took the rod case to Cancun for the first trip. When I got my case at Cancun the top cap was hanging half off. I tried to tape it to get back to Denver but it didn't make it. The cap was totally broken off. The top needs to be reinforce
5,Sturdy Case and Lots of Space,"I have only traveled with this case once, but I traveled with 7 other fishermen and all of my buddies had case envy. This is an extra large Bazooka case. I carried about 8 rods in it with no problem fitting them in. Four of the rods were heavy to medium action saltwater rods 7-8ft one pieces with large guides. The case was also easy for TSA to examine (as they did on both flights).Enjoy!"
2,Too repetitive,"Stet Howland of WASP, David Ellefson of Megadeth, Peter Scheithauer of Belladonna, and Todd Barnes of 13-A; on paper Temple of Brutality sounds like a heavy combination. On their debut album Lethal Agenda you can't deny that they ARE a heavy combination as powerful riffs, pounding drums, thumping bass, and furious vocals tear your eardrums apart.However, once you feel the burn from the opening track ""Lethal Agenda,"" you'll swear to God that you're feeling (and hearing) the same exact burn over and over again until it's over. You're sure to get a kick out of the bonus video that was apparently shot in someone's backyard."
5,Greatest Hoax of the 20C,"Rich in detail, this book dispells the myth that Jr. was in charge of coordinating architect and client.I visited Fallingwater, one time, and regret not having hadToker as my guide"
5,"Definitely the ""Wright"" stuff","Last August, my 17 year old son and I visited Fallingwater. In December, said son bought me ""Fallingwater Rising"". The book is a tremendous read. I now need to go back to Fallingwater (this time with my wife!) to get an entirely different view of the masterpiece.This is a history of the merchants of Pittsburgh, to a history of architecture, architectural publishing, with Ayn Rand, Henry Luce, the Carnegies, the Mellons, Frida Kahlo and of course the Kaufmann family and Mr. Wright included. Do yourself a favor and pick this book up. If you have never visited Fallingwater, you will yearn to; if you have visited, you will be anxious to return. Thank you, Mr. Toker."
3,All About ABBA,"I like a few ABBA songs and don't consider myself a fan, so for me, Elisabeth Vincentelli's entry in the 33 1/3 series brought some new light onto this group. Although it is a book about a greatest hits album, Ms. Vincentelli goes into the recording of each of the albums the hits were taken. Despite being known as more a campy group, ABBA were craftsmen in the studio and the endurance of the music is nicely detailed."
1,I know this is free but it's no excuse for garbage.,I was quite excited to see some Ezra Pound on the kindle for free. But I was quite disappointed by what I downloaded. Everything looked like it was cut and pasted poorly. I should point out it was free so you get what you paid for. Hopefully some day there will be some decent Ezra Pound collections on the kindle.
1,Never got it.,I never recieved this cd. Once again I lose my trust in ordering online. Was looking forward to hearing some old Coe.
1,This movie sucked,"This is the worse movie on the planet. Even worse than Darkman. Bad russian accents, horrible acting. I cant beleive someone produced this film on purpose. Run Run Run...."
2,"Ritz fans beware. The Ritzes walked out on this one, and so might you","THE GORILLA was the crux of a contract dispute between the Ritz Brothers and their studio -- the comedians complained about the script and walked off the set. They came back to finish the movie... but they were right. This has handsome production, atmospheric direction, and above all a solid supporting cast (Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill, Patsy Kelly, Wally Vernon, Anita Louise, Joseph Calleia), but the results are more noisy than funny in this stagey adaptation of an old play. Not at all typical of the Ritz Brothers, who were much more at home with musical comedy, and first-time viewers shouldn't judge the team by THE GORILLA. Lugosi fans will also be disappointed by his limited role. Video versions derive from retired 16mm TV prints."
3,LUGOSI IS A BUTLER (!),"When murders are committed by a criminal known only as ""The Gorilla"", his next target is Lionel Atwill, a wealthy man living in a creaky house with Bela as his manservant. Atwill hires the then-hip Ritz Brothers to solve the case. The three brothers are a sub-par Three Stooges/Marx Brothers troupe, with one of them even trying on a Lou Costello impersonation.Lugosi is an obvious red herring in this brief 1939 outing. His career would subsequently be briefly re-energized by a re-signing to Universal, before sinking into the murk of Monogram and Ed Wood films."
5,VERY FUNNY!!!,"The movie was a bit hokey, but still very funny. It wasn't scary at all (and I am easily scared). The Ritz Brothers were great. They really are overshadowed by others like The Three Stooges (whom I never thought was funny) and the Marx Brothers, so many people today tend not to remember them, but in their day they were highly regarded. I recommend this movie as a good family film."
5,Great cat toy!,"My cat discovered that slinky jrs are loads of fun to play with and bite/chew. So every year or two I have to buy him a new one because they get rusted from his slobber. I would recommend the larger/regular slinky to someone buying this for their kids but this is the perfect size for a cat toy. Just hang it from something and they can play with it on their own whenever they want. Just beware that if it is close to your bedroom, your cat might wake you up at night by playing with it."
2,Destroyed in 12 hours,"A slinky is what a slinky is. My five year old had fun with it - while it lasted. By 12 hours it was all stretched out and by 48 hours it was a modern art sculpture. I'm not really blaming it on anyone, but keep in mind that every young child I know destroys these things in a hurry."
4,"A mixed bag of original singles and airchecks - still, it's a good sample of Patti Page","This CD contains, as I said in the title, a mixed bag of some of Patti Page's hit singles and airchecks form about the same time. Most of the hit singles are available on other CDs; there is at least one CD that covers some of the airchecks (and I reviewed that one, ""The Uncollected Patti Page with Lou Stein's Music, 1949"" more than 4 years ago), so that this is really not an essential CD to get unless you are enough of a Patti Page fan to get the few tracks you can't get anywhere else. (But I suppose I _am_ enough of a Patti Page fan!)So the album gets 4 stars because I _do_ like it, though I can't really say it's a ""must-get"" because so much of it overlaps other albums."
3,Prettiest Song is Tennessee Waltz,This CD is okay. I purchased it for the song Tennessee Waltz as it is so beautiful. The other songs are not my favorite.
3,"Gangs, Drugs, & Redemption","This is a movie about a young man aimlessly drifting about a world of drugs, sex & gang violence. After being placed in a juvenile mental institute by his mother & step-father, he struggles to exploit & beat their system. Veering between the desire to find a place to belong (outside of a gang lead by his brother) & the desire to be with his violent friends, the main character tentatively comes to a resolution. Donald Sutherland finely plays the psychiatrist (with a drinking problem of his own) who tries to help the adolescents at the facility while in the process of losing his own family to the pressures of his job. This movie is worth watching for a fine version of ""Many Rivers to Cross"" performed by Toni Childs that runs over the final credits. The music redeems the weaker parts of the movie."
3,"Overall, not a bad album, Some good tracks...","I enjoyed Annihilator's Alice In Hell album. Jeff explores some interesting areas of the mind, and successfully conjurs up some interesting nightmares. I would have to say it may have been even better if it had more individual input, other that just Jeff Waters."
3,AMAZING GUITARRIST,"THis album has an amazing guitarrist in the fomr of the band leader, Jeff Waters. But he's clearly held back by the bad performances of his mates, the singer and the drummer (don't even want to know their names). The drums mixing is dreadful in this album, and the vocals, after the track ALICE IN HELL, are a disgrace. Anyway, this album has a punch that few trash metal albuns have."
5,Total classic!!!!,"Well, this album is a classic example that makes one wonder why some bands (or artists) manage to achieve enduring stardom and others simply don't. ALICE IN HELL is better than anything Metallica ever released, for example. (except for the vocals - but they fit the music here). Maybe that's because trash's heyday was already past in 1989, when ALICE IN HELL was released...Great album, all the tracks are special. And NEVER NEVERLAND would soon come..."
1,I can't enjoy this film,Today is the 2nd of August. And I don't still have this DVD. I ordered it on the 27th of June.
2,Thought provoking,"John Ralston Saul has the ability to identify the core matters that affect how people experience the world. His exploration of the six dimensions of human-kind that underpin our humanity is often provocative, and always stimulates the thinking of the reader. But he uses many words, and doesn't choose them particularly well. It's a difficult read and would have benefited from more careful editing. It is, however, very topical in relation to the impending American onslaught on Iraq. He identifies the fear of uncertainty as a key motivation for the adeherence to ideologies (such as those that guide the Bush Administration). Fear of uncertainty (Saul says) is an obstruction to thought - it's easier to embrace the simple guidance of (especially) conservative (and insular) ideology that America uses to protect it from an uncertain world. And that is what makes the book so topical.A difficult read, but worth it."
3,Useful but questionnable,"I liked the way this book is presented - like a dictionary. You can go to your area of interest immediately and get to the point. It deals with a lot of things from how to write a story to grammar and punctuation. However, I found mistakes in the use of punctuation, for example, the comma."
3,This is for advanced people.,I don't mean to discourage other people to buy this. This is a great book. But I needed something for my piano student who plays in the highschool Jazz band. It is too advanced for her to use it in the class.
3,Quality of Merchandise,"The merchandise I received looked send hand. The gun's nose was rusting. Looks like it had been used a lot and retuned, although I paid for a brand new stapler gun."
4,Chinese medicine,"A very good reference to understanding the Oriental view of how the body works and how herbs can help when ""just another pill"" can't."
5,Perfect As Described,"I bought this book used in good condition and it is exactly that. The book is actually in perfect condition minus the fact the the paper covering the hard binding is a little worn. For the price I can't complain at all, it was a great value! Thanks!"
1,AWFUL,"I WANTED TO LOOK UP MY CHINESE BODY TYPE, FOOT REFLEXOLOGY DIAGRAM, OPENING THE CHAKRAS, FINDING AILMENTS AND LOOKING FOR THE TYPES OF HERBS THAT WOULD BE RECOMMENDED. IN OTHER WORDS I WANTED TO USE THE BOOK AS A SELF HELP BOOK. BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED! THE BOOK HAD NONE OF THESE THINGS IN IT. IT INCLUDED THE HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THEIR PRACTICES BUT CONTAINED ALMOST NOTHING PRACTICAL. WASTE OF MONEY."
5,Shelley Duvall Bedtime Stories,"We use to let our 3yr. old grandson watch a couple of Shelley Duvall Bedtime Stories when they were ON DEMAND on cable, before he went to bed. Then they took them off. So when I discovered them on amazon, I was excited. They are fabulous. Our grandson loves them. They have become a bedtme ritual. I would very highly recommend these to anyone."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE TITLE!!!,"The title of this book is very misleading! The overwhelming majority of the programs listed require some time on campus. Although the program descriptions are good, the title doesn't deliver what's promised. If you want a guide that delivers spend your money on Bear's College Degrees by Mail & Modem instead."
3,This book was okay,The book was very informative and I can definitely see myself referring to it in my career should I be allowed to develop my own assessment systems but it was rather boring. A good resource for assessment ideas a lame book to read.
1,"Too breif, looks like a free handout for $27","This book was a huge disappointment. It looks like a pamphlet or brochure you would be given at as an advertisement for Montessori. I cannot believe they are charging over $20 for this booklet that is a mere 20 something pages most of which are illustrations like a comic book or children's book. The information in the book is OK, but nothing you cannot find on the internet for free. It looks like something a Montessori school would give to a parent who was considering sending their child there."
3,Not as good of a gift as I thought it would be!,The Golfer's Edition was nice but yet it still wasn't al that I had expected. It showed the thoughtfulness in it but I thought it didn't show as much of the inspirational aspects in golf as it should have. Is was to general for the Golfer that I bought it for.
3,A good gift!,The Golfer's Edition was nice but yet it still wasn't al that I had expected. It showed the thoughtfulness in it but I thought it didn't show as much of the inspirational aspects in golf as it should have. Is was to general for the Golfer that I bought it for.
4,"pretty earrings, but...","These are very pretty earrings, but the day I got them, I thought I broke them. I was scared about that!But it wasn't me, because they have a hinge closure that can bend easily. So you should be a little careful with these."
3,Great book for windows based users only!,"This book is great over all but It has a flaw.The book gives great detailed instructions if you are using Microsoft Windows, and all of the code is usable on other operating systems, but there are no instructions no how to use compilers or utilities for other operating systems.so if you use Gnu/Linux aka Linux, or Unix, or Unix based operating systems such as FreeBSD or Mac you may wish to avoid this book because of lack of instruction....if you do use the book look at installing GCC, GCC-C++ and GCJ.... for Linux,unix and mac... other apps are needed too but that will allow you to do most parts of the book."
1,don't waste your time,"when i took c programming, i tried the all in one desk reference for c. it was a godsend. so when i took java a semester later, i eagerly bought this book hoping it would work the same miracles. it did not. it doesn't focus so much on the OOP aspects of java, and frankly is very confusing. i was quite dissapointed.i tried two other java books after that, and finally got it right on the second try. 'head first java' is the holy grail of java books. don't waste your time, or money.. just get 'head first java' and thank me later :)"
5,I'd give it 20 stars if I could,"I have seen many journalism books, and this one is simply the best IMO. I can't wait to buy the second edition when it comes out!"
4,Not really a kid's show / was hoping for more b&w episodes,"I'm a big fan of Soupy. Ever since I first saw the show at age 7. I used to run home after attending classes at my depressing Catholic grade school in Connecticut so I could catch Soupy on t.v. This show was on WNEW in NYC, and was broadcast live. I am still looking for the episode where he tells the kids to go to their parents' purse or pants pockets, get a dollar out and send it to him. The reward? A postcard from Puerto Rico. Soupy got the plug pulled on his show (literally - they took it off the air right then and there because it was live) after telling dirty jokes on the air - this was a KID's show, but really didn't operate like one. I thought it was the most radical thing I ever saw (at age 7 anyway) and still have fond memories. However, this video has 50/50 b&w (old show) and color (new show). I was hoping for 100% vintage Soupy. Especially the banned episodes."
2,Absolutely the Worst of the Soupy Sales Show!,The Best of the Soupy Sales Show and More Best of the Soupy Sales Show are much funnier than this one. Save your money.
3,Soupy is not all here.,Not enough of the old Soupy. I think most of his tapes were thrown away. One good skit with White fang and black tooth.
1,Dead saw,"Bought this saw online. Died after 10 minutes of operation. Engine will not start, won't even kick over with starting fluid.Spark works, cleaned out entire fuel system including carb, put in known good fuel, still won't start.Expensive dud."
5,You'll be shoveling money into your wheelbarrow,"This is a really good book that will help you through the ins and outs of publicizing your business and yourself. From press releases, to getting yourself in the media, from creating your own talk show to establishing yourself as an expert, this is a book that will help you enhance your network. The section on how Mike Litman made his book Conversations with Millionaires #1 on Amazon.com was amazing!!! Simply amazing.The info from David Frey on writing ads was great as well. Just a well put together book that will help you rethink how you go to market and publicize your business."
4,Start getting that ONLINE gold!,This book is great for beginners. There is so much confusing information out there about how to make money from your website. This is a good first investment in your education on how to make the most on your online business at a reasonable price. A lot of education about online stuff is expensive and many times not worth it. I was able to take specific steps and start using them in my own business immediately. This book was written by 2 men who actually did what they are talking about and have the success to prove it. Good job!
4,"Hmmm, I thought I reviewed this one already","The best online marketing book there is, despite the grammatical errors. If you're new to marketing, this book spells it all out! It's a great resource, but could use a good editor."
5,REALLY NICE!,"I like this video! The best thing is that it's 3 in 1 so you don't need to buy 3 videos to watch all three of them. This video includes Sleepover, Birthday and Mall Party. They're all really nice! Mary-Kate and Ashley were also soooo cuuuuuuutttttteee when they were younger! I totally love them!"
5,I love this video!,"Mary-Kate and Ashley at their best! The videos contained in this comboare Mall Party, Birthday Party, and Sleepover Party. Sleepover Party is the first party movie the twins ever made. The songs are cute and classic, like ""Video Monster"" and ""Gimmie Pizza"". Birthday Party is cute, too. It has neat songs like ""Moon Bounce Madness"" and ""Pool Party"".Mall Party is recent. The songs featured in this one include ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Decisions, Decisions""."
5,Excellent episodes,"Being a Saiyuki addict, I very much enjoyed the retelling of how the Sanzo-ikko met. I liked the ecomomy of movement and use use of stills and voice overs. All together a must have."
1,Not that great...,"The whole ""story-telling"" theme wastes a lot of space that could have been filled with useful information.Having designed electronics for many years, this book does not show me anything I know to be wrong. So I don't know where that title is coming from????I do not believe this book is worth what I paid for it."
4,i had never seen her before this.,"i had never seen carole lombard(i had heard of her),before i saw this,i was dissapointed with ""Man Of The World"" and ""The princess comes across"" both were very slow and i didnt liket hem,However My favorite out of them all is ""Love Before Breakfast"",it was such a fun film. my other favorite was ""Hands across the table"", ""Were not dressing"" was cute/fun but not that great."
1,"Disappointing, slapdash presentation of Lombard..she deserves better.","Like Sardines packed in a tin, 6 of lovely Carole Lombard's lesser Paramount efforts are crammed on to two DVD-18 discs, so you get a nice cheap disc..which reflects how much respect (no less appreciation) Universal has for Lombard.The films range from mediocre to OK. None of them great, none of them bad. The prints have not been restored, and look OK, but this is what Universal has to do when they are selling these films as a budget item.Don't expect the incomparable high quality you get from Warner Bros. on these releases....the prints they were taken from are worn out and just plain bland.in life, Lonbard was on fire. On these DVDs, she merely fizzles out."
1,"Sorry, but just not good.","I am a fan of the thirties' movie era, but this collection just doesn't cut it. Imagine all of the bad qualities of Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With The Wind and none of the good qualities, and you have Carole Lombard. Her on screen persona in these films is just that of an irritating, flat out incomprehensibly difficult, and irrational female. The plots are all too far-fetched because no man in his right is going to adamantly pursue such a distasteful person. The plots in this collection of films are too stretched and too remote to be even slightly believable. The comedies aren't funny and the romances not interesting. Sorry to write such a negative review, but if I would have preferred not to spend my money on this set."
1,amazon shipping zero choices,Amazon now only uses USPS for shipping the buyer has zero choice in this. so if usps doesnt deliver to your address.... too rural for at door delivery or even worst live in a hotel you are SOL. I would not recommend purchasing from amazon under any reasons until ups or fed-ex is allowed as a choice for shipping. this product never arrived because usps wont deliver to my address. amazon needs to change this policy
4,classic Lombard,"Even when purchasing this set, I was not aware of this period in Carol Lombard's career. These films reveal her growing prowess as an actress and how she could command a scene. Other classic actors/actresses of the period are also preserved for our enjoyment. A good purchases if you like Carol."
4,Carole Lombard - The Glamour Collection,Carole Lombard is one of the most talented & beautiful actresses that ever played on the silver screen. This is a must collection for anyone that has fallen in love with her movies. Enjoy
2,A Big Disappointment,"I may be jaded by today's technology...but this film failed to deliver on multiple levels - it was forever leading to ""something big"" and only delivered on having to sit through to an unrewarding promise. I consider this a complete waste."
5,Stylish and comfortable,"I was looking for an orthopedic shoe that is stylish and, these May Janes fit the bill. I wear these with dressy pants and have gotten compliments on them. IF you walk alot for your job, as I do, I would definitely purchase them."
4,Shoes,"These are great shoe, only better if i could have gotten half size. They look great and feel good."
1,"Nice shoes, but they don't fit me.","Good delivery, easy return, beautiful shoes, but they don't fit me. Soft,nice leather, very nicely made. Gaped a bit widely at the front, at the ball of my foot, when I took a step. But, I doubt it was the shoe, think it is my feet."
3,Comfortable but Clunky,"I bought these shoes because I'm tired of my feet hurting by the end of the day. I am a teacher and I stand all day long. The shoes are extremely comfortable, but they are very clunky-looking. One of my students said they look like Mrs. Frankenstein shoes! I don't know if I quite agree that that assessment, but I certainly wouldn't say that they are stylish. I'm keeping them because my feet felt great at 4:30 - the heck with style."
5,"So very comfortable, from the start.","I bought these before, and wore them out. Propet makes great shoes for wide feet. At work I am on my feet most of the day, simply put; my feet don't hurt anymore. Do wish Propet made more styles though."
4,satisfied customer,"Love these, wish they had a buckle instead of the velcro strap, comfortable and true to size. Will order more of this brand!"
1,piece of garbage (and im being polite),"Perfect size, just what we were looking for to make snacks quickly. Love that the basket comes out, love the steel, love the fact it has a thermostat. Doesn't make a mess. Absolutely hate the stupid magnetic plug. More than once I've dropped a basket of food only to realize the plug had come loose (I think the lightest breeze loosens it) and I was soaking the food in cool or lukewarm oil. So you gotta pay attention to that. Unfortunately it just stopped working after less than a month. Now that I read the reviews, I see we're not the only ones that happened to. Willing to give it another try, sent for a replacement. If that one dies too we'll be looking at a different manufacturer.UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE. The replacement stopped working as well, only this time JUST after the window to return it expired. But if you want a greasy $44 doorstop, by all means send your money in."
1,It died in 30 days!!,"My wife had the same fryer under the Euro Pro brand and it lasted over 1 year which was also a short life, but, she liked the size of the unit since it took up such a small amount of counter space. After the 1st one died we looked for another like it and found the Deni. We purchased it and it workded fine for a month and then it would not heat any more. On the upside, it makes and excellent food bowl for our dog."
3,"Nice fryer, wish it was easier to clean","Needed a small fryer to quickly cook tater tots and fish sticks for the kids.Pros: The fryer heats quickly and it doesn't take up much space on the counter.Cons: kinda hard to see the temp numbers on the dial. You have to stoop down to counter hight to read them. My biggest problem with this fryer is its difficult to clean. The metal liner inside the unit is not removable. What this means is you have to very carefully hand wash the fryer, making sure you don't get anything but the interior of the fryer wet. Kind of a hassle. I wish it was removable and the next time around if this one quits working I'd buy one with a removable interior metal liner."
5,Love it,Great little fryer. Perfect for 1-4 people. This small appliance fitsnicely into a Motorhome or other smaller space. Its a lot of fun too!
3,Too small!,Fryer was too small for my family nothig was wrong with it would be best for a single person or college student.
1,Broken,"On opening the box, I found that the glass in the lid of the fryer was cracked. The glass wasn't very thick so it's easy to see how it could happen which is why I gave the item a 1 star rating. I sent it back for a refund and decided to buy one (different brand/model) at a local retail store instead of asking for a replacement be shipped to me."
4,Bought For a gift,I bought this for a gift. It seems to be pretty decent quality. I might buy one for my self.
1,Deni 9301 mini deep fryer,Product is not worth the money used mine maybe 6 times and now it is not working. Not much to go wrong but a heating element.
1,Good While It Lasted...,"I really liked the compact design for smaller quantities of food and having to waste less oil than the larger units out there, however as another reviewer mentioned, it broke. I had mine about a year and used it maybe 3-4 times. I went to use it one day and it no longer worked, so it wasn't due to overuse. A nice design with a major quality problem."
1,Total Piece of JUNK,Its made out of cheap light weight plastic and when I went to plug the power cord into the back of it the thing shattered shoving the connector into the bowels of this junk item. Not worth a dime!
3,Deep Fryer,This deep fryer is okay. It's much smaller than I thought it would be. But it works for the purpose it was intended.
3,"Good Fryer, but Small & Hard to Clean","This fryer lasted about 2 1/2 years. We used it quit a bit, then it just stopped heating up. We defiantly got our moneys worth out of it though. Only a couple of things. It is small. You can only cook one servings worth of anything in it. It is also hard to clean. There is a raised circle in the bottom and that makes it hard to get all of the gunk out when you are cleaning it. The lid was also extremely difficult to clean with all the grooves it had in it. Overall though, if you are just wanting something to cook snacks in this is a good choice for the price."
4,Small but good,"We've used this fryer to make a couple of different fried dishes and they came out great. The basket that comes with it is handy for draining the oil from the food, but if the oil is not hot enough then the batter will tend to get stuck on the mesh. Also, it is small so you can't fry a lot at a time, but that is expected since we weren't looking for a huge one."
2,A Truly Overrated Novel,"I'm very surprised that the majority of reviewers have given Flower Children five stars. The author's basic concept is a good one--share with the reader the experiences of children brought up in an unorthodox (read hippie) household. The novel itself does little to bring that concept to life. Although she has an interesting--almost poetic--writing style, I finished the novel feeling like I had learned almost nothing about the characters. The main character's three siblings are basically interchangeable, with no distinguishing characteristics. The readers are supposed to be empathetic with the children, but I felt as if they barely existed. Although the preliminary short story is compelling, none of the following chapters live up to that promise. This is a slight book built on a great premise. Extremely disappointing."
3,"Nicely written and compelling, but not exactly original","It should be noted that Swann is working within a French tradition (she has a master's degree in French literature & lived in Paris for a number of years). The French influence is obvious: this book owes much to The Lover by Marguerite Duras and to the novels of Jean Rhys (British, but living in Paris). Compare deflowering scenes in The Lover and Serious Girls and you'll see. Not that writing within an established style is bad, but keep in mind that this novel is not ""entirely original."""
5,An unforgettable novel,"Maxine Swann's book is something rare. She has put her finger on something about my personal (and what I assume is a universal) experience about becoming a woman that I don't think I have ever read before. Reading this book had a powerful impact on me akin to my first experience of reading ""Catcher in the Rye"" and others, but it was so beautifully unique. I will cherish this book for a long time to come."
4,Wheat Allergy Relief,I found a useful recipe for a wheat replacement flour. I am experimenting with utilizing this mixture in the place of wheat flour for baking and other purposes.
3,should have been titled Vegan Food Allergy Survival Guide,"Half reference book, half cookbook, there's a lot of great information to be found in this book. However, I wish the title had specified that this is a book designed for those following a vegan diet. For some people on very restricted diets it isn't practical or healthy to follow a vegan diet."
2,Didn't like it too much,"This was a good book, I guess, but it didn't serve the purpose too much for me. I have different food sensitivities than what what provided in this resource. I'm sure it could be more useful for others though."
2,Questionable information,"I was very dissapointed with the quality of information provided in this book. This book is filled with many half-truths and unsubstantiated claims. I am very supportive of a vegetarian lifestlye, but this book is hugely biased toward promoting a vegan lifestyle. People with food allergies already have so many limited food choices- this book makes it seem that they must follow an even more limted diet than they need too. Just one example- under the discussion of the health benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids, fish is not even mentioned as a source. This is misleading information. The topic of food allergies and intolerances is already filled with so much confusion and misunderstanding, I am afraid this book does nothing to help the situation."
3,Great item - not so great shipping options,"this is one of the best teas I have ever had and is a hard to find item. I was in heaven when I realized I could order it through amazon then very very disapointed when I had to ship it to my mom in Texas and have her forward it up to me here in Alaska. I do not understand why I can have a full length oak mirror shipped up here by priority mail but tea can not be directly shipped to me!??? We purchase a LOT of things off the internet and priority mail works Great and is inexpensive. As much as I love the tea, I am not sure it is worth the hassle of ordering it again."
1,Stick to the basics,"After using the older version of this book, I was disappointed by the sequel. Not only was the shipper terrible, the book showed up sliced and with no return instructions, but the content was already outdated. It has been a disappointment."
1,Dont like book,book is very basic. for the home owner (or joke architect) to become familiar with the basic concepts of building. not for a contractor or engineer.
2,COMBI ROCKER,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY BABY... I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING AT ALL... DOES NOT FOLD UP... THE HOOD DOES NOT STAY UP WHAT SO EVER... WHATS THE POINT OF HAVING A HOOD IF YOU CANT USE IT??? AND THE THING SUCKS UP YOUR BATTERIES.. I DO RECOMMEND HOW EVER THE MACLAREN SEAT... WORTH THE MONEY!!
5,This book is appealing to budding young scientists,"I cannot think of a nicer beginning book than ""My First Batteries and Magnets Book"". The color photographs make a child excited about starting the project. It is comprehensive in how to do the projects and what materials are needed. The only drawback may be the availability of some of the materials needed, depending on the where you are located; however most can be purchased at hardware stores and hobby shops.The projects are not many in this book but are of quality. Any child that enjoys this book will feel compelled to venture out on their own...searching for more ideas and inventions. Isn't this what we all hope... to inspire a child's mind? This book has it!"
5,"Pure, unadulterated brilliance","Unlike his solo grand piano work in ""Lovepiano"" or the classical favorites he jazzed up in ""Chopin in Africa"", in ""Ballad of the Rain"", Vyacheslav Gorsky effectively uses both synthesizer and piano to create smooth jazz music that is uniquely his own.I usually consider myself lucky if I can find two or three tracks on an album to which I can honestly give 5 stars. But on this CD, four tracks get my highest personal rating. They are:#2 Revelation (a tune as smooth as silk),#3 After the Carnival (with its great bass and percussion - especially the steel drum),#7 White Piano (grand piano, backed by bass guitar, synthesizer and Ruslan's excellent brush strokes), and#10 Whisper of Love (grand piano, backed by a synthesized violin section).It doesn't get any better than this, kids."
3,Disappointing,"I purchased the 2 pack and wrote a review for the beginner dvd. Unfortunately there is not much difference in the two DVD's other than different outfits so there isn't much more to say.This is a very simple basic workout. Do not be scared by the fact that it's led by Laila Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard. Anyone with no major physical impairments should be able to do this workout. I'm not sure why they're doing the video, but neither of them are motivational. The lack of energy Laila displays is shocking; especially after watching her on Dancing with the Stars.I will give them credit for putting together a good quality dvd from the standpoint of cueing, cameral work, sound, equal reps on each side... I have no issues with any of those things."
5,Great photo book!!!,I don't understand the one star reviews. This a beautiful photo book of a beautiful woman. Honestly how many of us will be models anyway? Great pics of Heidi and cute stories - what else do you want?
3,Like a Magazine,"This book is easy to read and is very visual much like a magazine, hence the cover art. It is packed with photographs from Heidi's long career. The layout is done in short segments so that it seems like a magazine filled with stories. There are several how-to lists like one that records what members of the opposite sex should know about each other.This book is a fun, female oriented account from a popular super model. Men will like the book for the many photographs, many of them semi-nude. It includes a bit of a biography telling how Klum got into modeling and information about her family. However, like a magazine, this book is nothing outstanding. The information is grazed over and the many how-to articles do not really add much. The opinions held are often those that can be found in the latest issue of Cosmopolitan."
4,"Beautiful, gracious, generous","A revealing book with lots of photos you might not see anywhere else.You get to learn Heidi's motto and get advice from lots of her famous friends.I recently got to meet Heidi in person, and I can say she's as beautiful, gracious and generous as she is in this book."
3,Great book but slow delivery,I bought this book as a vacation read and placed the order 1 month in advance...It took a month to get the book delivered to my door (which I didn't expect would be so loong) and luckily I got it a day before my departure for vacation. I'm happy my original plan wasn't ruined but it came close. I wish I was notified of the delivery time when I was placing the order. Otherwise the book is great and in excellent condition.
3,not the best,"needs more flavor-not enough butter, sugar and otmelher flavors-the caramel corn at the grocery is just as good-sure is notgourmet"
5,John Deere Steering Wheel Cover,This was a well loved gift! Great quality product and perfect price. Rather unique gift and perfect for any John Deere lover!
5,Great product,This is a great steering wheel cover for any John Deere enthusiast. It has nice grips and looks awesome. Perfect for collectors.
1,Boycott Katherine Ramsland and HarperTorch,"I gave this 1 star because that's as low as Amazon will let you go. Where does this lady get her information? What really upsets me is the way she approaches the ""West Memphis Three"". I've got news for you Katherine...they were not a ""satanic cult"". Why don't you and HarperTorch publishing get your s#@!t together and get your facts straight before you decide to print this garbage."
2,Piercing What Darkness?,"The author spends a lot of time discussing her forays into Goth, vampire, and fetish communities, but gives mostly soundbites about the people she encounters. We go from anecdote to anecdote, without really figuring out why people enter these subcultures, and what their everyday lives are like. She meets some nasty, scary types, with some deeply internalized pain and hostility, and does little to help us understand or sympathize with them."
1,What a pity.,"Given that the subject matter is pretty interesting, I found the book hard to read, mostly because of Ramsland's scattered organization, wierd investigative techniques, and uneven coverage. As befits an Anne Rice scholar, she refers constantly (even relentlessly) to Rice's books, even when it makes no sense to. Considering the constant references to Goth culture, it would have been nice if she'd given us a coherent definition of it first. Also,frankly,some parts of the book were just goofy: the ""vampire porno"" viewing session (which told us what?), her personal experiences with an ""emotional vampire"" (which was obviously a personal rant), and the whole encounter with Wraith, the 'real' vampire, which left me feeling that she is so gullible that the rest of her book is seriously questionable. Over all, I would still like to know more about this subculture. I just don't want Ramsland to write anything else."
1,Another avertisement for Anne Rice,"With all of the references to Anne Rice in this so-called ""investigation"" into modern-day vampires, you would think that Anne was getting co-author credit. This book is not worth the pages it's printed on. It seems the author was much more content to see how far into this world she was wiling to go than to actually inofrm the reader as to what this world is actually about. What ever happened to ""unbiased"" reporting?"
1,LAME!,This book is a total waste of time & money. It offered no insight on vampires. You get more info in an episode of Buffy or Angel.
2,The author's surprising stance on rumors,"I'm surprised that Ramsland fell for the hysterical hype about Damien Wayne Echols. She didn't do her homework with the first paragraph of her ""criminals"" chapter and has done a great disservice to the many scapegoated members of this ""subculture"" and others by simply quoting rumors. Damien is not a ""vampire,"" a ""satanist"" OR a murderer. He was not a member of a ""dog eating"" cult. Let's move beyond Geraldo once in a while and check those facts.. It IS important. - b u r k"
3,Interesting book....reminder for WM3 supporters,"The book is written in a very conversational style, and dashes all over the place. The reader would do well to remember that Ramsland wasn't JUST writing this book, but that she was researching a number of other books during her escapades.Also for WM3 fans, please keep in mind that at the time this book was written the injustice of this case was just beginning to come to light. The commentary on it in this book was unenlightened at best, and in the years since then Ramsland has even written an article on bitemark evidence that cites the bitemarks found on the victims and exonerates the WM3.We must in our passion and support of Jesse, Damien and Jason always speak with intelligence, and not just knee jerk reactions."
2,I'm glad I bought this at Buck-A-Book,"I found this book very disappointing because it presented itself as a work of investigative journalism, but soon turned into a socio-psychological treatise on the allure of the vampire image in modern society. Too much of the book was philosophical speculation; too little of the book was hard journalism. Ramsland's writing style is hardly riveting, and I skipped dozens of pages to find interesting parts. Too often she writes pages and pages of dialogue with ""vampires"" who are obviously dysfunctional and emotionally disturbed, expressing themselves with bombastic language a la Anne Rice, Poppy Z. Brite, and Giles of Buffy fame. I found it very hard to wade through page after page of this drivel. There were some insights, but nothing that hasn't been thoroughly revealed by others in previous works."
3,Nonfiction? Debatable.,"This could have been a fascinating read had Ramsland really put her money where her mouth is and gone ""undercover"" and/or indepth. I never believed for a minute that she was actually going to risk her safety to get the real material that surely exists. The characters are interesting but unbelievable and the outline elementary. Basically it's another fast and mindless read that I am embarrassed to have spent six bucks on."
2,"Bad Fiction, Not Good Journalism.","Which would be more insulting to a reader's intelligence? That Ramsland's ""investigative journalism"" is so flimsy that she's taken in by transparently fictional vampire stories spun by a neurotic goth named ""Wraith""? Or that Ramsland made the stories up herself, and for the sake of ""a good scare"" expects us to buy into the cardboard masquerade?Hey Katherine, if ""Wraith"" is real, he was playing you. A first-year journalism student would have seen through it. If you made it all up, then publish it as a novel next time so we'll know where to file it.A shame, too. Ramsland skims the surface of a fascinating cultural phenomenon. Too bad she didn't have the discipline to follow through."
3,positive with hesitations,"Not graphic enough to be a trashy read and yet not insightful enough either to qualify as a psychological analysis of the vampire subculture but interesting enough despite being a good 100 pages too long. Very episodic as well. And she is a bit naive -- quotes casual acquaintances like they were believeable, reliable sources."
1,"I'm terribly sorry for this pun, but this book lacks bite","I'm not sure what bothers me more about this book--the deeply flawed ethnographic research or the profoundly offensive fetishizing of the subjects by the author. Despite the fact that the author apparently cannot tell the difference between s/m and b/d, and despite the fact that the subjects of this research are exploited for narrative purposes, there may be a modicum of value in this study--if only as a model of how not to write a book. Ramsland should stick to penning hagiographies of contemporary horror authors and leave the sociology to true professionals."
1,Anti -Psychotic Medication Required!!!,"I loved Ms. Ramsland's book ""Cemetary Stories"" so I was really looking forward to reading about her foray into the Vampire Culture in search of a ""real"" Vampire. All she found was a lot of sad lonely individuals of questionable sexual persuasion who engaged in 'Vampiric Costume Drama"" for the sole purpose of having a sexual encounter. One gets the feeling that these poor misguided individuals could all benefit from a great deal of Therapy and/or some Heavy Duty Medication.Even Ms. Ramsland becomes jaded with these poor folk by the end of the book.One gets the feeling that it would be easier to find a 'real"" Vampire working the Graveyard Shift at your local 7/11 than in all of the S&M clubs she visited."
2,"Thrilled, Chilled, & Disappointed...","If you are about to buy this book stop! The book will thrill you, chill you, & disappoint you. Taking you into the vampire underground & blood fetish territories this book will get your heart pumping. However the book will leave you with an extremely bad feeling at the end. That feeling is disappointment. I personally looked past the harangues, but the ending shocked me. How the author didn't pickup on the meaning of vampires 'till the very end is disturbing. Yet on the good side this book will keep you listening until the end. It will entrance you & leave you with a cacoethes to keep listening. You'll want to know what's going to happen next & what other curios the author will encounter. But then again for the price I'd take a look at another book..."
3,informative,"I read this book about 6 mths ago, but from what i can recall, i remember being very much entranced by it and not being able to put it down. It is basically about this woman (katherine ramsland) adventure into the ""dark"" vampire world and her encounters with different people. The only part i would say that did not intrigue me was the part about role playing. Those chapters may be skipped. Overall, an average book."
4,A Very Pastorale Album,"The theme of the album is consistant through the album, pastorales. There are a few songs accompanied by oboe, a wondereful combination. The opening cut, Pastorale, is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard, the oboe and organ presenting a hauntingly beautiful combination. I've put this album on and found that it makes for nice background music. It can also be rewarding when devoting one's mind completely to it.There is a sound heard on the album which might be the organ keys or other mechinical noise. When I understood what it was it was not a problem for me but added a certain presence of the organ.The album does not come with a booklet when bought as an MPG3 download. I hope in the future Amazon does what other music sites often do and include a printable booklet."
4,Bluesy and ballsy,"If you've come this far you're obviously someone who recognisesSteve Marriot as one of THE voices of rock,blues and soul music.This disc showcases a particularly sweaty night in Germany in 1985.The recording itself is a little booming but that only adds to the authenticity of this release.The voice is in fine form with Somekind of Wonderful,All or Nothing and Tin Soldier being standouts.Steve's guitar work is great.At times understated genius,elsewhere loud,raucous and totally rockin'out.But it's his voice that really shines.That whiskey soaked, soulman voice that never really got the recognition it deserved.If you like your music meaty,beefy,big and bouncy give this one a go.Heavy,blues rock done by a master."
5,The Dude Rocks,I'd almost forgot how good this album was. Lost in my album boxes for years. A great dance-funk sound. Louis Johnson (Brothers Johnson fame) and Steve Lukather (Toto) really jam and just add to the all-star cast Quincy Jones gathered. You really need to add this CD to your collection.
3,didn't live up to my expectations,"From what I knew of some of Quincy Jones' other releases, and judging by the comments I'd read, I was expecting something a little jazzier than what I got (especially since Patti Austin's name was attached to it). The CD is well-produced (I wouldn't have expected otherwise), but the selections are pretty standard disco/soul-era pieces with not a lot of creativity and edge. My favorite cut was ""Velas"" - a sweet, tranquil piece featuring Thielemans' harmonica. ""Just Once"" and ""One Hundred Ways"" have been done to death on the smooth jazz and adult contemporary stations. I suppose I should have checked the copyright date - 1981 - which would put this towards the end of the disco era. A decent CD for those looking for this type of thing, but jazz/soul or urban R&B or swing big band lovers should look elsewhere. Just a warning so you don't get caught like I did!"
4,Love it!,I'm a fan of Quincy Jones and much of his various musical offerings of the 60s 70s and 80s. The Dude is a classic album with some productions reminiscent of his 'Of The Wall' work with MJ a couple of years prior. Definitely worth buying!
2,Way Too Difficult for Elementary School Reader,"I'm a fifth grade teacher. Several of my students read the book before I picked up the audiobook to listen to. My student didn't like the book, and listening to it, I can see why. The humor is way over the heads of even some of my better readers. I've enjoyed it, but it's not a book I'd recommend to students."
3,Stale Roth,"This satire on the Nixon Administration was flat when it was written, and is even flatter today.The extraordinary talent and inventiveness of Roth on occaision lose themselves in formula- projects like this oneAs there are so many rich and good Roth books I would not even waste my time with this one."
2,Very dated satire.,"Definitely one of Roth's lesser books, ""Our Gang,"" written almost entirely in dialogue, purports to be a pox-on-all-your-houses take on the Nixon Administration. Unfortunately, it's chiefly notable for being one of the most heavy-handed satires in memory, as Roth repeatedly extends promisingly witty riffs well past the point of endurance. The over-the-top finale completely jumps the rails. Hard-core Nixon haters might like it--but don't you have better things to do with your time?"
3,Chispa,"I love Bill Cosby and this disc was funny enough, but very short. I listen to the whole thing in my 40 minute drive to work."
4,bill cosby millennium collection,"funny stuff but old so I have heard it before but Cosby is funny, i enjoyed it, and would recommend it."
2,"material is great, but cd makes a weird noise in our stereo","I bought this cd for my son's Christmas stocking and he was very pleased to receive it. The material is classic Cosby and is very funny. However, the CD itself makes a ""whirring"" or ""humming"" noise in the cd player that is so distracting you can't enjoy the cd."
5,Grandchildrens favorite,My grandchildren love the cd. I do not have a DVD in my van so they listen to Bill Cosby. We laugh so hard. They know the routines. All their friends are jealous
5,Crooked,"This is a great novel by one creative author. i am 16 and live in miami.. and my parents were [upset] because i wouldnt put this book down. i read this book during dinner, at the beach, in the car, at red lights, everywhere. i loved it. i never knew i could speed read until i read this book. this novel doesnt follow a typical motif or theme, as in other works of literature. Melody (the main character) acts like someone in the real world.. not just someone in a false pretense existence. i truly thank god for freedom of speech after reading this novel. i would definitely recommend this book."
3,Interesting....,"This was an interesting book. I don't really know how I could be engaged enough to actually finish it. It was painful to read and it kind of brought feelings that I didn't want to feel while reading this book. You pity the main character for her experience in jail, then her work and release job... but later it seems as though all her actions are vindicated through her reasoning.. and you wonder if thats normal? I don't know, I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,Sputtered at the end.......,"Despite its predictability, the story was compelling and kept me interested throughout. Most of the characters were fairly stereotypical: Spoiled Rich Girl, Spoiled Rich Girl's Spoiled Rich Freinds, Bad Boy from Other Side of the Tracks, Ivy League Educated Bored Financial Guy, Bored and Unsatisfied Wife, Mob Underboss Aspiring to be the Boss, Two Bit Mob Soldier/Capo, Exhibtionist Sexy Foreign Wife of Super Rich Guy, Mediocre Career Detective. But the story did take a twist or two that kept it entertaining, but the end was a disappointment. After spending many pages developing characters and plots, the whole thing got tied together neatly at the end rather quickly. Too neat and too quickly--it reminded me of a Brady Bunch episode. It all worked out at the end. Not that many novels regarding the mob are steeped in reality, but the ending here was too neat and clean for a Wall Street meets Godfather story."
3,The story seemed to stick in the mud after the beginning.,"Living close to Seymour, IN, I was able to watch the making of this movie one summer. I was very excited to see the familiar scenes on the big screen. I am a big Mellencamp fan so it was hard to be critical of this movie. The story line seemed to go nowhere."
3,A good effort,"I've been a Mellencamp fan for years, but I just now watched this movie. The acting is pretty bad at some points. The script could be better. The plot is the kind of thing that appeals to the same people that like Mellencamp's music, though -- big themes here are people's failing relationships and struggles with middle-class mediocrity. I think it's worth watching, but I'm not going to buy it."
1,What a disaster!,"Horrible. Absolutely horrible. Even though I have been a Mellencamp fan for many years, I feel it necessary to warn anyone to avoid taking time out of their life to watch this movie. Bad script and tragically bad acting."
1,Can't Understand a Word,"What a disappointment! I saw Falling for Grace in a theater (one of four people there.) I'm a huge fan of JM, but the story was confusing, and even though I lived in south central Indiana for 5 years, I couldn't even understand the dialects of some of the actors. Anyway, it was nice to see places like Medora and Seymour on the big screen."
1,How Many Singers Have Gone Down this Road Before?,"Self-Indulgent doesn't even Descripe this Boring film.John Mellencamp who I Respect More as a Musician is Lacking as a Director,Actor etc...This FIlm you can watch for free almost every night it's called Jerry Springer."
1,One of THE WORSE movies I have ever seen!,"This movie was AWFUL. What the heck was this movie? John Mellencamp playing HIMSELF? The man is a medocre actor, at very best. The rest of the actors were WORSE. The plot was dumber than dumb. Long and drawn out, with no redeeming value whatsoever. Do NOT buy this movie! I would have not given it ANY STARS if that option was available, so I had to settle on giving it one star. Too bad, since I really enjoy Mellencamp's music."
5,great movie,i have no idea why so many folks are bashing this film. sure its not a special effects extravaganza with a huge hollywood budget . but as a movie exploring small town life and the things left behind its pretty good. mellencamp's acting is suttle but pretty decent in my opinion. the ultimate test of a good movie is if it entertains and it did the trick for me.
4,Mellencamp in a great movie,Great movie about small town living with a big star that comes back to shake things up. It's a very good story. Mellencamp is not the star in this movie. The story is.
5,FULL METAL AWESOME,"FMP is the story of Kaname and the Mercenary Sousuke. Kaname is a high school student that holds the key to black technology. An advanced form of technology used in military applications. Sousuke is a mercenary assigned to guard her. The problem is that he has been fighting battles since he was a young boy, and he has no common sense or social skills. He is always causing trouble for her, but he's the best candidate to keep her safe. The story follows their adventures from their high school all the way to the battlefield and back again.FMP has everything you could want out of an anime series. Action, comedy, drama, sci-fi, and a bit of romance. The animation, story, and soundtrack are all awesome. It's a 5 star series in every possible aspect. It also stars the best voice actors in the business. I have always loved this series and I hope you do too."
1,Save Your Money,I didn't care for the book. The book was full of redundant information. This could have been printed on about 5 pages.
5,Great Book - Logic & Math,"I found this book to be concise and to the point. Written by a mathematician but in plain, easy to understand English. I read it in one sitting. I was so impressed by the book that I ordered his Lottery software program the following day. It's a smart investment if you're serious about winning the Lottery."
5,"Brilliant, inspiring!","As every Bernstein video or performance, I found this DVD very amusing and most inspiring."
4,Almost as good as the movie!,"This video is the first 3 episodes of the new series.. It introduces most of the characters, and gives good insight into the younger years of the X-Men. I would reccomend it to all fans, over the original animated series."
4,enjoyable take on xmen story,"Liked this revisionist take on the teen Xmen going to a regular high school and trying to fit in while living at the Xmansion. Good stories, art, and voice acting kept the quality up and the high school atmosphere ensured a lot of jokey humor."
4,X-Citing,"X-Men: Evolution is my favorite cartoon on tv right now, with good reason.Unexpected Changes contains the first three episodes of this awesome series. In the first, Strategy X, Scott's powers are accidently unleashed at a football game while tying to defend another mutant named Todd. Meanwhile, Kurt Wagner adjusts to life at the Xavier Institute, with some interesting results. In The X-Impulse, Kitty Pryde's powers develop one night, and she meets Lance, a fellow mutant who will be a very important figure in her life even after they're recruited to opposite sides. In the final episode, Rogue Recruit, a young goth named Rogue develops a dangerous power with unlimited possibilities, and Mystique makes sure she'll never join the X-Men.While these episodes aren't as good as some of the one's in the second season, it's a strong start to a cool show. The animation is lovely, the music is catchy, and the characters are great. I highly recommend X-Men: Evolution!"
1,Sacrificing Quality for Diversity,"Where's Ice-Man?Ice-Man has been a quintessential part of the X-men since their creation. Yet, he's no where to be found here. Instead he's been replaced with ""Spyke,"" nephew of Storm.There's no reason for this substitute except for ""diversity"" and this unnecessary change really lessens the quality of the story.I'm a huge Ice-Man fan. I was greatly disappointed by this series."
1,Not too bad for an unknown.,Musically the guitar playing was enjoyable but at times it seems like he struggles to hit the high notes. He moves in and out of chest voice so much that it breaks the smoothness of the song. The voice is nothing unique but in all just an OK cd. There are much better cd's out there worth buying.
2,It's not worth the money,"I own this book. While it does contain some valuable information on the Value Methodology process, it not to be considered more than a companion to the author's course on Value Enigeering. Thus, I have not found it to be a good nor readable resource.Much of the text (326 pages) is devoted to overhead presentation type information, i.e., heading and bulletized list likely originating from the author's own presentations developed to teach his class. Have you ever received an overhead presentation without the author's notes? It is very difficult to understand the points being made. Many pages contain examples of forms that a VE team leader might want to use. They amount to little more than a page full of empty boxes. In the latter portion of the book, many pages contain very little information and lots of empty wordless space. This text is not a book, it is a compilation of stuff gathered over the years that the author has taught his VE course."
3,"Heavy, heavy reading","Note to any casually follower of this genre. Do not buy this book. Deep Politics And The Death Of JFK is a heavy academic read that doesn't come off the page lightly or with any pace. Each page is filled with meticulous and exact information that grabs you fully. This isn't a light read with a dramatic storyline, this is a real hard look into the facts surrounding the relationships that dominated politics at this time in U.S. history. While it is an impressive piece of work it is not to be read lightly."
2,Disorganized Mess,"This book could have been so much better. While I don't agree with all of Mr. Scott's views, it's clear he's put some time into them. The problem is that the book's presentation. It is a complete mess and it assumes you know all of the background on the people he discusses. The book is a rambling mess and if it was a college paper, it'd scrape by a passing grade. What a disappointment."
4,Into the mind of the killer,"What makes Chikatilo fascinating is that it took so long for him to be caught, and the reasons for this delay. He was incredibly lucky, in some ways, but the structure of laws, customs and means of communication in the Russia of the time are the real reasons for his long career as a killer. Conradi explains all of this clearly. What is not so clear are the details of how all of the info he presents was acquired. Did the author have access to confession documents, or interrogation documents? If so, the readers would sure like to see them included in the book. Overall, a very readable, informative book."
3,"uneven crime study - masterpiece in some areas, lacking in others","Conradi's book is not too bad. My biggest problem with it is that it is subtitled ""Russia's monster serial killer and the men who stopped him."" This is somewhat misleading, as there is very little about the policemen and the detectives who stopped him.On the positive end though, one will find few books anywhere that spend so much time discussing the mindset of a killer in such detail. Conradi does a masterful job recreating the horrific crimes. And even though the psychiatric interview at the end is extremely tedious in the first couple of pages, the summary is well worth the time."
4,Tough read but worth it !,"Bizzare on both ends, the killer as well as the cops. If you like serial killer books this is unbelieveable!"
1,"One star too many, not worth any stars","I sent this product back. Awful. My lower back, shoulders, upper back and neck HURT for 3 weeks following the 3 or 4 times I attempted to use this product. Very high impact I would say. And the crazy thing kept creeping backward on the carpet, I would have to get off and reposition it after every 2 reps. Terrible product. I also didn't feel it was doing any good, for hips, buns or thighs. Just killed my back! Went to see my chiropractor the following day and the popping my back did, wow. Threw everything right out."
5,Not as simple as it looks,"This product really does tighten the buttocks and thighs. I love to do it while listening to the TV or music. I began to see results after two weeks, and using it four times a week for less than thirty minutes. This beats going to the gym anytime!"
2,Not what I thought it would be,I am not a fan of spurt natural like books or movies. Plot was ok gut just not. For me
3,Different & Hard to follow at First...but a good Read,"This was my First Melanie Jackson Novel. It was different than what I was used to and was hard to follow at first. I expected it to be like other books I have read, I guess. Melanie Jackson Definately ""Breaks"" the rules of the average Romance Novel but really pulls you in with a storyline that you have to read & FInish, even if the Love scene's were somewhat lacking. This writer definately DOES have talent though, because it has made me want to read her other stories to see if they could be better than this one. If you are looking for Something Different & Interesting to pass the time, Get this book. If you are looking for something like hot and steamy, you'll be disappointed in this book. If half star's were an available rating, I would rate this 3 1/2 stars."
1,Missing parts,"It clearly states the product comes with a mounting bracket and quick connect fittings. Both of which are missing for me. Since I already have a plumber here to do the job, he has to ""make it work"". I am totally bummed out."
2,short term,"Opened the package from amazon, inserted the battery. Read the manual and plugged it in. Read the codes, repaired the vacuum line, reset the faults. Everything was fine till then.Checked the website and found out it cost <$10.00 pm to be useful.Checked the codes in the scanner and then checked the memory: the minute I did this the scanner went dead with error 2, MEMORY FAILURERETURN FOR SERVICE.THE SCANNER HAS BEEN IN MY POSSESSION FOR LESS THEN 4 HOURS!"
5,Actron CP9175 Auto Scanner,The product is user friendly & you are able to move about screens easy to read codes right in the unit it's self insted of looking in the book .But the unit comes with the book also. Item was what was described in the ad and very GOOD service. I will use this site again. THANK YOU. Ronnie Eaton
4,Did what it was supposed to,"Easily retrieved codes. Would have been nice if there was a way to look up the ""meaning"" of the code. All you get is a generic description of the code from the unit. The only problem is the connector gets stuck on my Nissan Maxima (there is a hole in the connector that latches onto the car connector) and it is very hard to disconnect."
2,Nice device but....,"I purchased this device with high expectations after reading reviews by several persons, only to discover it does not work on several OBD II equipped Japanese vehicles I've connected it to. It attempts a search of the vehicles' computer but the end result is an error message on the scanner's display screen. I just tried it again on my brother-in-law's 2005 Toyota Matrix only to get the same result.Even more disappointing is the lack of software updates for CP9175 which has also been noted by other reviewers who've purchased the device."
4,"Nice unit, but updates are vaporware","The scanner works great and the messages are understandable.The ""Internet update"" does not exist - vaporware. How can they sell a cable without having the drivers available?? Dunno."
3,Actron CP9175 AutoScanner Diagnostic Code Scanner,"I am satisfied with this product. It is quick and easy to use. The only complaint I have is that it promises to erase fault codes therefore turning of the ""service engine light"" I found that even though it does the warning light comes right back the following day for the same reasons. Other than the above, the codes readings are clear and seem accurate.Pizzo"
1,Actron CP9175,I have found this item to have little to no usefullness at all.it seems it is only good for limited items.Kurt Kaufman
1,Good Luck Getting This,"After ordering this in stock item 10 days ago, I just got an email that says it will probably be another 16 days before it arrives. I have purchased over a hundred items on the internet and it has never taken 26 days to receive an in stock item from anywhere. I have even received items from Hong Kong and China within 7 days. I don't know what kind of problems Amazon is having but this is a little ridiculous."
5,Actron is always improving,I have used the older Actron products for years and this one has everything I wanted to troubleshoot our 2006 model.
4,great needed tool to have,geat tool to have for your car. I bought this because it also had the RS232 (DB9) connection. not able to connect to computer thou. Still not a big deal.
5,Works Easily as Described,"I bought this to verify independently the meaning of a ""Check Engine"" light whose repair was to be quite expensive. I have had trouble with repairs made following prior interpretations of this light in the past. The device connected as explained in the documentation. It gave me the verification I wanted. My use is only occasional for information, so I can't address how it might perform as a mechanic's tool."
4,reason price and very easy to use.,This product is cheap and easy to use. the only thing I dont like is the book does not have the code description. You have to search on line. well now this day every body able to access online that must not be a problem.
5,Save diagnostic charges with Actron CP9175,Very well built. Easy to use without reading a manual. Comes with the codes stored in the handheld device.I am just sorry I did not buy one sooner.
1,PUTS CARS INTO THEFT LOCK-BAD!,"I HATE ACTRON, I THINK THEY ARE JUNK...I BOUGHT A CP9580 AND IT PUT MY CAR INTO THEFT LOCK, THEN I COULDNT START IT ... DONT BUY JUNK, FACE IT , THE WORLD SELLS A LOT OF JUNK !"
4,"very good tool. A battery eater, though","Tool is extremely useful and handy to have. One caveat though.... a brand new 9v battery only lasts several hours on it, even with the unit turned off..."
5,Actron CP9175 Scanner - performs as advertized,"The CP9175 is not a substitue for a VAG programming tool, but it will perform all advertised fucntions efortless, and competienty. It scans, displays DTC codes, translates them and erases them as promised. Use it once at it pays for itself. Highly recommended as an adition to any enthusiasts tool box."
5,The only battery for an Eberline SK-1 Speaker,"The Energizer 504 is the only battery that should be used in an Eberline Geiger counter speaker. You will see posts here and there about using various other batteries of improper voltage. Why would anyone do this when the correct battery is so readily available and at a great price. The only compliant I have is I wish it was available in a alkaline battery. That said, these carbon-zinc batteries last for many hundreds of hours of continuous use. I highly recommend these in this application."
3,Kissing the Bride,"I though it was a good book, but once again the ending seemed rush, or not as good as it could be. It was wrapped up again with like effort on the hero's part. I liked Henry and Jenova, and they were great character. I would give in a 3.5. Still a good read, if not a great read."
4,"Exciting, indepth story of the violent Cookson Hills of Oklahoma","A well researched story of the violent times in the impoverished Eastern Oklahoman area that was spurred by the depression.I really enjoyed the read and was most impressed by the research Morgan went to in order to make the connection between people, places and conditions.Morgans summary at the end of the book as to the lives of most everyone in the book was especially interesting.Fred Staff author of Young Bass Reeves."
1,Y i hate the movie,First off the movie stinks munchie looks like a ghouly rip off every thing about this is lame.its so bad i fell asleep till the end. If u must buy it dont pay more than a couple of bucks for. It.
4,Excellent!,This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. The laughs just kept on a comin'. You should definitely buy this great one.
1,Munch on this,"Munchie can make pizzas fly down the street. They found munchie in some box hidden away in a mine or something. Jennifer Love-Hewit is in this. So is Loni Anderson. This is a heartwarming tale of a kid who finds Munchie, then gets springboarded to popularity. Munchie is cool. He looks stupid, and when he talks, his hands twirl around. Watch this movie late late at night with friends, you'll laugh your head off. That one big guy from Canonball run is Munchies voice."
2,Not Much Fun,"This toy is not much fun. The box boast about ""REAL LAZERS YOU CAN SEE""!!!!!, But it is not true. You can't see the lasers, it is just 2 red cords with little hooks to clip them from one side of the base to another. the game is pontless, The Objective, bounce foam balls through imaginary lazers! not much fun or much of a purpose. If you have that ""oh-so constant and unbearable urge to bounce stupid balls through a ""light"" you can't see"" you might as well just use a tennisball and a flashlight. P.S., does TIGER ELECTRONICS come up with these stupid concepts, I mean how stupid are they, WHATS THE POINT OF THIS!"
1,BORING,"I bought this for my 7 year old. It's boring. There are no lazers either. My son played with it that day and hasn't played with it since. Even if it's cheap, don't waste your money on it."
5,Perfect,"There are only four stories in this book, but each one is a jewel. The characters are all distinct, with a unique way of speaking, and their own story to tell. The writing is sharp and crisp and every word is there for a reason. Each story should be savored but I dove in and read them all in one sitting, and now I plan to read, and re-read each one over and over. How is it that I've never heard of this author? This book is one that should be passed around to friends, left on subways for strangers, and handed out as party favors.After spending way too much time slogging through books that aren't worth the time it takes to read them, this book is a fantastic, unexpected surprise. I plan to order all his books and hope each one is as good as this."
4,Palace Thief plus filler,"This collection of four (no so short) stories is uneven at best, but the title piece, The Palace Thief, is a gem. The Kirkus reviewer didn't think so, but then that reviewer's summation of the story was surprisingly simplistic. I think most readers will get more out of it than that. My advice is to get the book for this piece alone, although story number three is also a worthy read."
4,THE ACCOUNTANT MEETS WILLIE MAYS AND QUESTIONS HIS LIFE,"I ESPECIALLY ENJOYED THE SHORT STORY ""THE ACCOUNTANT"" ABOUTA MAN WHO CONSIDERS HIMSELF MODERATELY SUCCESSFUL LIVING AMETHODICAL LIFE.HE CONSTANTLY COMPARES HIMSELF TO A FLAMBOYANTAND HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL OLD FRIEND WHO HE GREW UP WITH.AT THE END HE SURPRISES US WITH HIS IMPETUOUS ACTIONS, HISCONFESSION TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS QUESTIONING OF THE CHOICESHE MADE DURING HIS LIFE.I ENJOYED THE RELAXED WRITING STYLE OF THE AUTHOR AND HISINSIGHT INTO HOW A MAN TRAPS HIMSELF IN A LIFESTYLE ANDWONDERS HOW HE GOT THERE."
2,Only one gem in the palace,"This book contains 4 short stories that are good, but not terribly memorable (even though the back cover calls them ""unforgetable""). I read this book only a couple of weeks ago and can only remember one of the stories very well: The Palace Thief.The Palace Thief has nothing to do with a palace or a conventional thief. It was also used as the basis of the movie, The Emperor's Club. The story has the same feel as Dead Poet's Society with a professor that gets his students to dress in togas as they study Greek history and literature. The story is good but, in my opinion, the only true gem in the palace of this book.Ethan Canin likes to infuse his stories with baseball and other diversions enjoyed by men. I suppose these are the types of things he himself enjoys when he's not writing books or working as a doctor."
5,Has every feature I wanted!,"I have had this unit for months and use it at the office daily.Simply Love it.Used a SKYFI2 boombox for a year before replacing that unit with this one. The ability to use FM radio for certain shows, XM radio for part of the day and even cds from one single unit is terrific. Sound quality is acceptable for an office from low single cube volume, to loud TGIF afternoon celebration volume. Equivalent sound quality to the boombox, that does NOT offer the FM radio/cd option that this unit does. The XM Roady has the stock ticker option so even when I have the sound down, the ticker shows the stocks everyone in the office tracks.The product is large and bulky, not suited well to carrying around. But if you are looking for a portable unit that mainly stays in place, this unit will work just fine. I have used the SKYFI receiver in this unit and a Roady XT and both work well.Yes, I recommend this. Very satisfied with this unit."
1,I've Been Had !,"1. This system is OBSOLETE - it has not been made for the last 2 years It advertises RoadyXT compatible - they no longer manufacture the receivers for this - a receiver isn't included. There's a 30 day return policy - I purchased this for a birthday gift - 3 weeks early. There is a 20% restocking fee and return shipping is out of your pocket. You can purchase on E-Bay for 20 bucks! Delphi or Digital Media was absolutely no help on this Hard, but good lesson learned....."
1,Impressed but technical problems,"The concept and design are very good. However, I returned the unit after 1 week because of technical problems. I asked for the same product as a replacement but, it was not available. My money was refunded. The technical problems were; a low level noise when playing the XM radio and the display screen did not funtion properly when playing the CD. I replaced it with another Delphi XM product and have been very satisfied."
4,"easy to use, good value","I bought this for my wife at Christmas. It looked pretty good and has decent features, although I've since learned of the limitations. First, the remote doesn't work from more than a few feet away, and needs to be pointed a certain way (although I'm not sure what that is yet!). The sound is pretty tinney, and of course, the antenna must be positioned to face the southern sky......so home application is limited. I haven't taken it out in our boat yet, but hope it will work better there.3-2012.... I have now taken this to two new homes, put the account ""on vacation"" twice, and now have reactivated it. I upped my rating because its easy to carry around and gets reception most anywhere. It sits in our back yard."
4,Great boom box,Great multipurpose radio for someone just looking for a boombox. Wish the alarm worked when in XM mode.
2,Third times a charm,"Well, I learned one thing from ordering this product. Porttronics has a wonderful customer service department. I had to return two Delphi SkyFi CD Audio systems due their failure to work. The first one worked for a day and then the speakers quit. The second one, the CD player would not work at all. The third one works but there is interference when playing CD's but only when it is reading the CD into memory. It is a great concept but the follow through with quality production is just not there.On the other hand I would recommend Pottronics (them being one of the many companies partnered with Amazon) to any Amazon customers due to their excellent customer service."
3,OK for the money,"Unit makes motorboat hum in the background. Turning up the volume decreases the effect. I read other people returning unit for another, however, it is not worth the hasle for the price paid because it will probably make the same background noise. Good for the price, but don't expect Bose quality."
1,Tired of Sending it Back,I sent this boombox back to Delphi twice for power issues. The power would drop in and out and then eventually die altogether. Delphi never did get it fixed and I ended up eating the shipping costs. What a waste of time and money.
4,Best buy,"All are original videos from the 50's and 60's. It is a pity that the most well-known hit Changing Partners is not included, otherwise this DVD deserves 5 stars."
4,B+,"Suuuuuper fast shipping!!!! I really appreciated that. Loved the product!It looks great, fits good, and feels great! My only complaint would be the condition that the item came in. I can tell it has been on the market/in stock for a very long time based on a couple of cosmetic blemishes, but its okay because I loooove The Simpsons"
3,Okay,The Olson twins really are growing up quick. Quicker than what I imagine. The movie was not the best but it wasn't the worst either.
1,STOP IT,"Im sorry, but the videos in which they were 4-10 years old were Um, but this is pathetic. At least it is one of thier last creepy videos. THIS IS SO FAKE. I mean who's life is like this, Nobodys. And their is one dumb backstabbing freind who is uglier than Mary-Kate's bush hairdo (AND TRUST ME, IT'S UGLY)."
1,This is supposed to be High School?,"This was the stupidest movie they have done. Mary-Kate and Ashley (sorry can't remember their matching too-cute names) attend the Spring dance (Springdance.com, how creative!!). One of their dates dumps them (but then gives them a rose) and the other doesn't get to be cyberqueen with her boyfriend (oh no!). They also sing their horrible raps and songs which used to be cute but now are just dumb. They really, really can't sing (painful painful),Their school looks like something out of degrassi junior high (with a marble bathroom!!), and the dance decorations are not something a highschool budget can afford. I wish that they had least made this a middle school dance, but why highschool? Both of the twins could pass for seven without the caked makeup and styled hair."
3,"1,000 Back-up Singers Too Many!","Ok, the video starts out cind of strange! The girls are totaly lip singing. Not only do they have bad singing but they have about 1,000 back-up singers! On the song Monday Morning I couldn't hear the Olsens at all! I liked the clothing. My favourite song is What's All The Noise Aboute Boys(because Mary-Kate and Ashley dance in it)."
1,WORST MOVIE,I saw this movie on tv.IT WAS SOOOOOOOO LAME. I mean come on. Mary Kate and Ashley always get what they want. AND WHO SINGS DUMB SONGS IN THE SCHOOL BATHROOM? Reality check. Just a waste of our time. Oh and the plot and ending was so easy to guess.
1,Thank goodness it only lasted 26 minutes,"This movie was just SO BAD. I actually like the Olsen twins even though the constant ""cuteness"" can really get on your nerves sometimes. But nothing in that movie was realistic, at all. First the twins are supposed to be in high school but none of the girls look older than 10. Second, girls you are very good actresses... but please please please dont sing or dance ! The singing was atrocious. Dancing was no better. The ""lyrics"" if you can call them that are beyond lame.I think Mary-Kate and Ashley, if they watched that movie now that they are 16, would cry of embarassment !!"
5,will ashley become queen of her school?,This movie is awesome!You'll watch it over and over again with fun filled music life and olsens.It is spring dance for marykate and ashley for their school.Thy've each got a date.But the one question asked is will ashleys last?Will she become queen with her king or will another lucky get the guy.To find out buy this movie.I guarentee it!
5,Classic Joe Sample,I have alot of Joe Samples Recordings both as a Member of Teh Crusaders&Solo&this Album is one of those Albums you wanna play non-stop.Joe Sample is such a Genius on His Overall Fusion within His Playing Style.the Man has a Way of Building up a Groove&then you get the trademark Guitar Licks&Horns come right on with the Drums.this Album has all His Trademark Musical Ingrediants&so much more.Joe Sample is one of the Baddest Musicians I've Ever Heard.A Must Have Set.
3,so far so good !,this had bad reviews but so far so good for a simple system it seems fine . not many connectors so if you have more than 1 hdd and optical you are screwed ( 3 star rating) i have hell with power supplies but i put this one on my sons upgraded system .. so we will see ..
2,Logisys PS550A-BK Computer Power/Noise & failure Supply,"Ordered this power supply in February 2012 after the OEM power supply on my PC died.As stated by other reviewers this is a noisy PS, and the variable fan speed is annoyingly obvious because it changes speed all the time even when the PC is idle.Even with all its faults it was a usable PS, for a short time, but it has started to fail after only eight months of moderate use. So I can only give it two stars.I have ordered a different and slightly more expensive (and better rated by Amazon users) power supply, (Thermaltake Power Supply 240-Pin 600 Power Supply W0388RU). I just hope it arrives before this failure of a PS dies.Best advice for prospective buyers: 1. Don't waste your time and money with this power supply. 2. Trust the Amazon reviews, They are generally spot on correct."
1,"Horrible power supply, ridiculously loud","I can't believe how loud it is, and I've owned a lot of power supplies over the years (including some really cheap ones). I recently ordered a more expensive PSU just so I won't have to put up with this piece of garbage anymore, it can't get here soon enough."
1,Wouldnt buy this thing again if it was the only one manufactured.,"It worked well for the first 2 weeks, then the intake fan started to sound like a bi-plane taking off until it finally stopped altogether and overheated. The dollar sign caught my attention, and evidently I got the one that quality control let slip by. But you get what you pay for sometimes. I know better for next time. Good luck to the rest of you guys. Hopefully their return policy works better than the actual product."
3,Loudest power supply I've ever owned,"I found this power supply after filtering on Amazon for ""silent power supplies"". I needed it for my HTPC setup.It is by far the loudest power supply I've ever owned.It's too cheep to send back and I'm too lazy to do it. So, I decided to keep it.Other than that it successfully supplies my HTPC with enough power to work. Also, merchant was very fast shipping it."
2,Logisys PS550A-BK,"This product, although a reasonable price, had a very long power connector to the motherboard. This power connector cable had about 24 individual wires which were not contained inside any sheathing or wrapper. This made for a very messy install unless I personally found something to wrap these wires in to prevent them from being loose and in the way, hovering above the motherboard. It made me worry very much about the real quality of this product. If I had known about this beforehand, I would not have ordered this."
1,Not for 5th grade.,This book is a collection of math problems. There are no systematical lessons followed by problems.Besides this book doesn't contain the 5th grade level math. So not a useful book for 5th graders.
4,How importnat the Land is to an Irishman,My husband and I just returned from Ireland so we saw first hand how important the land is to the Irish. Richard Harris is Brillant in The Field. It really showed the struggles of a family in an Irish village.Will make you think twice the next time you complain about how hard your life is.
5,A parable of Irish History,Richard Harris' performance as Bull McCabe a tenant farmer determined to preserve a way of life that is threatened by progress (represented by the American played by Tom Berenger) drives this film. The story has qualities of a classic tragedy almost King Lear like in McCabe's obsession and ultimate downfall.The screenplay is excellent and the locations and authenticity of the settings lend the film a realistic atmosphere that is truly outstanding.Very well directed with not a wasted scene. A true quality production that got little notice but deserves to be seen by anyone with an interest in Ireland.
2,The Field is horrible,"I did not enjoy this movie at all. It makes Irish men look like a bunch of buffoons. I do not recommend it to anyone, as it portrays Irish people bery badly."
2,"Well acted, but depressing","The other reviews do a good job of reviewing the acting, scenery, etc. It was a good movie if you like to see the decline of a man's sanity. Mid-way through the movie, when he beats the Yank to death on a rock, I lost interest. The field was everything to the man, which I guess was the point. It was depressing and somewhat gruesome. Not my choice for a good movie. My life is hard enough, I don't need to live someone elses hard times. Thanks, but this movie wasn't for me."
2,Powerfully depressing and bleak,"With ordinary actors this movie would be depressing. With Richard Harris finding enormous, brilliant energy in his role as the doomed main character, it goes beyond depressing to being scorchingly, searingly upsetting. It's bleak, harrowing, dismal and severely gut-wrenching. If that's your kind of thing, this movie delivers it in spades, way more forcefully than the next ten downer flicks put together.I saw it on cable and walked out before the final, awful ending. My wife sat through the whole miserable story and confirmed that the ending was even heartrending than the rest of the movie.Two stars because of the acting, otherwise zero stars. Life is too short, and there are enough miserable things to deal with, that I prefer not to voluntarily subject myself to painful movies.You've been warned. I wish I had been."
2,"Wonderful film, terrible DVD","I'll leave comments about the value of this movie (which I love) to other reviewers. what I want to warn buyers about is the rediculous lack of features on this DVD. There are, literally, NONE. There's not even a language menu for close captioning... it's essentially like buying a VHS tape that's been transferred to DVD. Don't waste your money."
5,Extraordinary Drama,"This is one of the finest tragedies to ever come to the screen. The story of a man's obsession and his fall from grace. Only a Richard Harris could pull this off. It surely ranks as his finest hour. This film is an undiscovered gem. How unfortunate that Pioneer's DVD release only offers the truncated aspect ratio of 1:1.33! Perhaps one day they will release a version that shows the entire ""field""."
5,emotional,"richard harris is amazing in this film. it is a complex story, but keeps coming back to the central image, the field itself. its moving, and very sad, and anybody with a soul will connect with the characters. also, the irish scenery is beautiful."
3,The Internet for Dummies (--For Dummies),"Probably the hardest books to review are those that have the potential to be the very best and just don't make the grade. The authors have impressive backgrounds in the subject. The ""For Dummies"" series offers the potential for superior editorial guidance. Yet I felt that this book fell substantially short. Although many subjects were covered in depth the book consistently left me wondering ""where's the beef?"" For example many topics were often covered in just a perfunctory way leaving me thinking ""I need more information on this subject just to begin the subject."" Two examples of this are the coverage of downloading software off the WWW and ICQ. What if the authors would have not told their continual little cutsey jokes and puns and supplied more information? What if the publisher had not left so much unprinted space on each page and supplied more text? Perhaps then they would have delivered a superior book. As it is it is just mediocre."
5,Your Pass to the Net,"Almost everyone has heard of the ""For Dummies"" books. The ""Quick Reference"" series' direct method and clear (sometimes playful and fun) language make learning easy. ""The Internet For Dummies Quick Reference"" is a fact-filled quick reference that gives the chance to find out a small, clear and fun guide which takes the horror out of meeting the Internet for the first time.""The Internet For Dummies Quick Reference"" is a quick guide designed for beginners. Authors do an exceptional job of explaining a large number of Internet terms. You'll also find here a lot of tips for optimizing your browser for speed, building your first Web page, managing e-mail, subscribing to mailing lists, and go shopping on-line. Here is really the perfect guide to help users find their way around the Internet."
1,Out Dated!,"Just felt it was out dated and way too basic for anyone who has ever been online. I was hoping for a little more meat. It was probably a great resource four years ago, but with the internet changing so rapidly, it needs to be updated tremendously. Most of my disapointment is my own fault... I should have seen the March 1996 publishing date and clicked away."
1,"Too cute, not enough solid information.","This was my first ""dummies"" book, and definitely my last. There's enough basic information to help you get started, but I spent too much time trying to make my way through the too-cute text looking for solid information. This series may be a bestseller, but my dollars would have been far better spent elsewhere."
4,You never answer a question or problem completely.,I keep getting knocked off the web or my computer (compact Presario4540) will freeze up while I am on line. I cannot get an answer as to why and I have searched your book from cover to cover. AOL on line cannot help either. They told me to empty my temporary internet files - OK -- HOW? This information is not covered in your book either. Help.
4,Dummy and Dumber,"Yesterday I installed Eudora and followed the tips in the book. I've also used the book to find help for friends with e-mail and/or Internet problems. I'm new to the computer and ""Internet for Dummies"" has helped me in the quest to be ane-nerd."
4,great for first timers,great book for people that aren't very familiar with the internet and all its workings.
2,Simply...AWFUL,"I can truthfully say that I am not a died-in-the-wool fan of Simply Red; however, they have released several songs which I thought were quite palatable. After reading all the other reviews, I thought...well...we'll give this one a try. Big mistake.I don't really know how to describe this music: folksey? middle-of-the-road? pop? easy listening? bluesy? I think they were going for just about all the above but they should instead think about the ""blues"" part.Sorry folks but I just couldn't get into this one."
5,PLEASE BUY IT,"WHEN I HEARD SIMPLY RED 15 YEARS AGO , I SUPPOSED THAT THE MUSIC OF THIS BAND ALWAYS STAY FOR YEARS, EVERY ALBUM GIVE US SENTIMENTAL, DANCE , MIX, WHATEVER, MICK IS THE BEST SINGER AN BEST SONGWRITER AN MUSICIAN, YOU NEED TO LISTEN ANY ALBUM,, NOW STAY GIVE US THEMES, THAT REMIND THE CARRER OF THIS GREATES BAND."
3,Quality production of fair material,"Good quality complex vocals and arrangements as to be expected from SR, but somewhat disappointing regarding the consistency across all songs. Overall lyrics felt too familiar to previous work. Only a couple songs have the potential to be memorable and will bring me to revisit the album again."
5,LOVE this CD!!!,"Honestly, I did not even know ""Simply Red"" was still recording. I remember them from the 80's (Holding Back the Years), but can't remember anything from them since then. I was listening to a jazz station last week and heard ""So Not Over You"". I immediately came home and ordered the CD. I love it!!"
3,simply red,"love the one song, & the rest are ok. he has a unique sound of his own. but glad he has a new album out, its been a long time"
4,Gave as a gift,"Was expecting it to be more of a game, where as this is individual card solving logic questions. I gave it to a family with three children 5, 8 and 11. They enjoyed it because it has all their different levels for their age level. The mom and dad liked it because it was educational. The 8 year old seemed to keep going when everyone else stopped. I don't think it was his age as much as he liked logic. Great for kids. Very glad I bought it. My one real complaint is that they should have given more ""tiddlie winks"" so everyone can have enough discs to work on their puzzles at the same time."
4,What do you expect?,It's an outdated consumable for a technology no longer widely available...it's a blank tape. It works. What more do you need?
3,"some good, some bad","These tapes hard to find so glad to get them. They arrived timely and were all in new packaging. However, some (at least half) of the tapes are unusable as they make lines, noises, play at wrong speed etc. This was very disappointing."
2,Martina has officially sold out!!,"Continuing the trend that started with her last CD, Martina McBride has decided to trade substance and credibility for some crossover pop success. Whatever happened to the days of ""Independence Day"" and the like? The song ""I Love You"" is a trite, contrived piece of pop bubble-gum. The whole CD just indicates what is wrong with country music...its personality crisis. Mainstream country artists these days will sell their souls and record any kind of junk just so they can be accepted. If you want to record pop, please just go and do a pop album...the country-pop blend is corny and simply sounds ridiculous. Either do country or pop, Martina, not both. But she's not the only culprit....just look at Shania, Faith, and the countless other me-too country artists. I actually used to like Martina before she got claimed by that thirst for cash/record sales."
2,Bland Bland Bland,"Cutesy bland country pop, sung with earnest conviction. Lovers of Garth Brooks and Faith Hill will doubtless approve."
1,Very Disappointing,"I am a big Martina fan and have been anxiously awaiting her new release. I have never been more disappointed, and what makes it harder is that it is such an unexpected disappointment. Martina still has an amzing voice, though she doesn't use it to it's full potential on Emotion. The songs, however, are terrible. This is not country music, it's sellout fluff. I gave my cd away after listening to it once, and they actually gave it back to me on the same day after hearing it for themselves."
1,should go back to her roots,don't jump on the band wagon of trying to cross over. was very disappointed and wish they would give refunds on cd's
2,Just Not Country Enough,"Country Music fans are fiercely loyal to their favorite artists. I am a country music fan, but I won't blindly buy a CD just because it is put out by an artist I enjoy. I pride myself in telling it like it is. Let's face it...Martina's voice, while enjoyable, is really only average at best when compared to true country divas like Trisha Yearwood or Reba McEntire. But in the past, her songs have still been pretty good. Unfortunately, this CD sounds more like a Debbie Gibson 80's bubble gum pop album than a 90's country offering. If there's a country song on this CD, I haven't found it yet. Therefore, an average voice with little ability to convey ""emotion"" coupled with slightly below average songs equals a disappointing offering. The best thing about this CD is the cover."
2,Evolution is tough to top,I know that Most Martina fans realize that Evolution is hard to top. This cd does does not have the same fire and boldness as Evolution and is missing a lot of steam. Their is a lost of passion in many songs and its clearly not a great effort. Sad to say this being a big fan of hers.
3,"I love her voice, but it sounds too simple.","Every time I listen to this CD my mind roams and I can't quite concentrate on the songs. Martina does a good job with her amazing vocals, but the overall sound is mainstream country. Unlike with Evolution, I couldn't quite hear her stand out from the crowd of considerably talented female singers in Nashville. I love Evolution and this CD is a good follow up. I just wish she had more of her own sound - that's all. With her voice she could be even better! I agree with Billboard and give her a B+."
3,Not for me,"I love Martina McBride and I have all of her previous CD's which are absolutely awesome. However, the latest CD, Emotion, does not stand up to the others."
5,You Go Girl!!!!,"I can some this review up in one word, WOW!!! But I have more to say about this fantastic CD. Martina joins the ranks of Shania, LeAnn, and Faith by crossing over to the Pop/Rock music arena. I think it is great that some of the hot, young female country singers of today are not being pigeon-holed to just the country music arena and that they are being allowed to spread their wings into different music genres. Martina voice is so strong that sometimes it blows me away and other times it brings me to tears. The selections on the CD suit her versatile voice perfectly. When I first heard ""I Love You"" from the ""Runaway Bride"" soundtrack, I knew that I just had to have this album. Martina has a fan for live with this listener. I look forward to future releases from this rising star, and let's not forget, Contry music's Female Artist of the Year (it's about time!!!!)."
5,WHAT A GREAT CD!! I LOVE IT!!!!,"To say that Martina McBride has an amazing voice would be the understatement of the century but it's more than just her amazing voice that makes her the best female singer in country music. I've been a country music fan for 20 years and not since Reba McEntire has a singer touched me like Martina. I always thought that Reba was not only a great singer but the best ""interpreter"" of a song i had ever seen or heard until I heard Martina. Her emotion, attitude and feistiness on such songs as ""Love's the Only House"", ""It's My Time"" and ""Make Me Believe"" makes me want to hear more. ""There You Are"" is possibly the most beautiful love song I've ever heard and ""I Love You"" is so upbeat and fun. I can honestly say that Martina McBride is the best singer I have ever heard. ""Emotion"" takes the listener on a powerful and fun emotional ride. Thanks Martina."
3,Good Martina - but missing her usual punch!!,"This album is missing the punch of Evolution, however it is a much softer,less dramatic album. The songs she has chosen are strong in lyric yet don't display her powerful range. I think this album is good - I'll probably listen to it for years - will it be one of my favorites - probably not - It's missing the heartbreak of Independence Day, the passion of That's Me and the power of Standing on the Side of the Road.....Hopefully Martina hasn't sold out on her country fans as this album is missing a true country song."
3,"Good, But Evolution is much better!","This CD is pretty good but has way to much pop sound to it. The best songs on this album are ""I Love You"" and ""Goodbye"". The first has been a #1 for several weeks and deserved it. The second single, ""Loves The Only House"" has a good beat to it but with corny lyrics that tries hard to send a message similar to David Lee Murphy's much better song ""The Road You Leave Behind"". The opening song, ""Do What You Do"" is a good pop song but will probably be played on country radio. I rate Evolution 4.5 compared to this 3 star album. Buy that one and you won't be sorry."
3,A good cd but not her best,I love Martina McBride and I think she has the most magnificent voice of any female singer. I was kind of disappointed with this cd but there are a few good song on it. Her best cd of all is EVOLUTION.
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I AM A BIG MARTINA FAN BUT I WAS LESS THAN THRILLED WITH THIS ONE, DEFINITELY NOT HER BEST EFFORT. ONE OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS COMMENTED THAT SHE HAD ""CROSSED THE LINE INTO POP"", THAT MAY BE FINE FOR SOME BUT IT'S NOT WHAT MADE HER THE STAR SHE IS TODAY, THIS ONE WAS MY LEAST FAVORITE OF ALL OF HER CD'S TO DATE."
5,NEEDS TO BE SEEN AND HEARD MORE,"I am a big fan of country music and the sexy siren Martina keeps my love for country going. Martina McBride is right on top with her piercing eyes and melodic voice. This cd explores the ""pop"" side of country. For some artists who have already crossed over into the pop scene like Shania, Garth & Faith; Martina remains as a true to her country roots but seems to enjoy flirting with the pop sound.""Do What You Do"", ""Make Me Believe"", ""Anything's Better..."", ""There You Are""; are just examples of the exploration she takes to find a little pop in country. But the song (s) that are almost completely covered with the ""pop"" icing are ""I Love You"" & (ballad pop) ""There You Are"". As for the rest, they are mostly her true roots: country.This is one of my favorite cds of all time. I have a list of my top 25 cds of all time; this is on the list--trust me. She is not only sexy but talented."
3,Kind of disappointed in this latest album,"I have been a fan of Martina's since I first heard ""Independence Day"". Since then, she's given us so many wonderfully written songs; especially on Evolution. Her music has always gone beyond country in my opinion. I don't have a problem with the pop edges on Emotion, it's the songwriting. Martina does her best to sing these songs, but I don't hear her heart in them like I'm used to hearing. If you listen to Wild Angels or Whatever You Say, and then listen to the songs on Emotion, you can almost hear two different voices. I like her voice a lot, but I need to have something behind it too. To anyone who bought this album, I recommend Evolution, so that you can hear the Martina that I think is the real one. On a side note, does anyone else think that she looks a lot thinner?"
2,"Her weakest effort , more suitable for the pop charts","Having purchased four other CDs by Martina McBride, and having been completely satisfied with them, I have to say how disappointed I am in this new effort. I am appalled at the pop overtones to this CD and the selection of tunes presented. After Evolution, which was a tremendous album, it's a let down to listen to this one. I'm sorry I spent my hard earned money on this CD and in the future am going to be more selective before I buy another one by Martina. P.S., her voice is, as usual, exhilarating and spine tingling, I just wish she had chosen her material more wisely."
3,"Great Voice, Good Songs, Poor Production","Martina McBride is undeniably the most talented female singer in popular music today (yes, better than Celine Dion). Her voice is liquid gold! However, ""Emotion"" is a step backward from ""Evolution"" and her previous efforts. Several of the song selections are suspect (like ""Do What You Do"" and ""From The Ashes""). The good ones are produced poorly, with thin instrumentals and no steel guitar or fiddle. That was her intention, but I think the plan backfired. Country music is based on its instrumentations, and McBride has stripped these songs of their heritage. What is left is bubblegum pop music. Martina has set her standards so high that this effort looks like pure fluff. I hope she remembers her country roots on her next album. I recommend this album, but just barely."
1,Wish I'd bought something else!,"Like everyone else, I anxiously awaited the release of Emotion. Wish I'd listened to some of the songs on the CD before I wasted my money. Martina is one of the greatest singers of all time. It's disappointing that she has turned her back on Country Music just like Shania and Faith. This CD is defintely NOT Country Music!! Until they start singing real country music, I'll spend my money on someone else."
4,ONE OF A KIND VOICE!!!,"This makes the second Martina McBride CD that I own, and I really enjoyed most of the tracks. My favorites are ""Do What You Do"", ""Anything's Better Than Feeling The Blue"", and my all around favorite is ""Make Me Believe"". The songwriter's definitely got it right!!! Martina shows us her vocal talent on the whole CD!!! Keep up the great music!!!"
3,LOST IN POP,"IF YOU WANT TO HEAR MARTINAS BEST COLLECTION OF SONGS AND MUSIC WITH,"" EMOTION "" POURING FROM EVERY SONG, BUY THE WAY THAT I AM. HUNGRY AND DRIVEN THAT IN MY OPINION IS HER BEST. SHE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THE MOST TALENTED FEMALE VOICE IN MUSIC TODAY.IT IS ASHAME INSTEAD OF LETTING PEOPLE FLOCK TO HER AT HER BEST IN COUNTRY,APPALCHIAN STYLE SHE TOOK THE EASY ROUTE AND WENT SUGAR COATED. THERE ARE STILL SHADES OF GREATNESS ON THIS CD IN,MAKE ME BELIEVE AND A KILLER IN I AINT GOIN NOWHERE IS JUST PLAIN GREAT.I GOT USED TO HEARING TOP TO BOTTOM EXCELLENCE AND FELT THE SLIP IN ( EVOLUTION ) AND EMOTION WAS A LET DOWN FOR ME. THE FIRST THREE ARE TOP TO BOTTOM 5 STAR QUALITY. MAYBE 4 BARELY FOR EVOLUTION, AND 3 STARS FOR THIS ONE. I SURE HOPE ITS NOT A TREND FOR FEMALE COUNTRY,GOD FORBID IF PATTY LOVELESS VENTURED OFF I WOULD BE LISTINING TO COURTNEY LOVE."
3,Country Overlaiden with Pop,"I was very excited for Martina's follow-up to the brilliant ""Evolution"" CD. There is some pretty good stuff here, but for the most part, it's a little too ""pop-ish"" for me. I just hope this turns out to be an experiment and Martina goes back to her true roots in country. She's got one of the most incredible voices around."
3,McBride's Vocals Are In League Of Their Own,"Martina McBride's amazing vocals take center stage in her fifth album, ""Emotion."" The album boasted four charted singles (all with different messages). Many say this album shows a level of inconsistency unusual for the seasoned veteran, but McBride has a unique and strong story-telling talent -- appreciated mostly by women.""I Love You"" is a wonderfully written love song that highlights the bubbly, sparkling new feelings one feels when they have fallen for someone. ""It's My Time"" has a great message of blossoming into being your own person and realizing it right now (hence the title).Other highlights are the other two released singles, the plight of those less fortunate in ""Love's The Only House,"" and the romantic ""There You Are"" that introduces a soothing piano introduction. Different beats coincide in ""I Ain't Goin Anywhere"" and ""Goodbye.""Crisp country sound in varied beats showcase McBride as a true vocal talent -- making it worth the purchase of the CD."
4,"I loved it,but not every single song.","I loved the cd especially ""I Love You"" and "" It's My Time"". The cd was great I recommend it to anyone who loves a good country-rock mix. Thanks."
5,I Love Martina's Voice.,"Once I Heard ""I Love You"" A Number 1 Hit, The Voice Was So Beautiful. But This CD IS ""Love's The Only House"" A Top Five Hit. Buy This CD Today."
4,superb explanation of how the Imagineers operate,"This is a fascinating look into the mind of the premier Disney designers. Hench explains how every single detail of the Disney parks is designed to fit into a great whole: color, form, space, and even time must reinforce a narrative theme in every single ride or experience, as if the viewer had entered a film sequence. All detail is foreseen - with storyboards! - discussed, and built with this kind of total consistency of experience in mind. I was astounded that the parts were so much more deeply planned than I had imagined.I read this as part of my research for a writing project on Disney. For this, it was extremely useful and informative. It strikes me that the imagineering method is of great relevance to all managers.While easy to read quickly, this book will give anyone who likes Disney a fascinating new perspective on one of the great American success stories. Warmly recommended. The writing is clear and to the point, while elegant."
5,A good introduction,"This book is a beautiful little introduction to the way Disney creates appealing designs. It's not an in-depth text, but that's not what it claims to be. Instead, the author gives a nicely structured overview of the various facets of design used to make Disney's parks and attractions more appealing.I read it because they are masters at what they do -- look at the crowds that keep coming back -- and it's important to me, as a programmer, to have at least a clue of what works. It was well worth my time.Even if it hadn't been useful in my eyes, this was an appealing book and I enjoyed the time I spent reading it. What more could I ask for?"
2,"OK, but not what I hoped it would be","I wouldn't buy this again. The author use the term ""I"" way to much for someone that worked for ""team disney"". It's not terrible, just kind of tedious."
2,just ok,"This is a very small bag. From some of the pictures I thought I would be able to get my camcorder and digital camera in it, but could not. The material is thin and lacks padding. If you have a cheap camera I would recommend it. If you have expensive video equipment I would get something more substantial."
5,The Best of Country is a better title,"Paul Overstreet has the ability to incorporate the best of good living into real country music. No ""she's cheatin' on me, so I'll cry in my beer"" type songs here. Just good, uplifting messages borne from a deep relationship with the Lord. ""All the Fun"" is about a man who doesn't need to find something outside of his home. ""My Father in Me"" is a real tribute to fatherhood. ""Richest Man on Earth"" helps one appreciate what we all have; and ""Heroes"" is a great song about the importance we all have in someone's life. Good...no, GREAT stuff. Amazon should carry ALL of Paul's music - songbooks, too!"
3,Repetitive.,"I'm intrigued by the polar literature and so was excited to see they'd done a miniseries. Maybe because I already knew the story, but I found it repetitive. Not enough story, not enough character development to last as long as it did."
4,The Last Place on Earth,"""The Last Place on Earth"" video is a great historical adventure of the discovery of the South Pole told from the research accounts of Roland Huntford, the book's author. The fine acting and scenic photography in difficult weather conditions makes this DVD a must buy. The only issue I have is the clarity of the DVD which is slightly fuzzy. Possibly playing it on a Blue Ray DVD player may make the image resolution better. It would make a great Blue Ray DVD emphasizing the fine photography. Key missing elements from the PBS Masterpiece series are the episode introductions by Alistair Cooke."
4,An Adventure of Courage,"Some fifteen years ago when this series was aired on PBS, I was captivated by the story. Although I knew the basics about the race to the south pole, this series explored the personalities involved. Regardless of how one condemns or praises Scott and Amundson, it is a grand adventure that explores courage and honor, loyalty and conviction, and perserverance in the face of impossible odds. It is a wonderful, inspiring true story."
1,Unimpressive DVD quality,"The other reviews are on the mark with content: this is a superb film. My low rating is due solely to the poor production standards of the DVD set. No digital remastering here. The grainy transfer to DVD looks every bit of twenty years old. No sound enhancements either, only a single AC3 stereo channel. Worst of all, Alastair Cooke's episode introductions, which accompanied the series when it was originally shown on Masterpiece Theatre, have been eliminated, replaced with cheap graphic images of the production company's logo. Unfortunately, this is the only Region 1, NTSC-format of this important series that we are likely to get."
4,Feel Better Naturally,"""Flower remedies are nature's soul food. The right flower remedy can bring about inner transformation and guide you back to your true path. After taking flower remedies many people experience a subtle shift in their sense of well-being, their mind is clearer and their enthusiasm for life is renewed.This A to Z lists three types of flower remedies: Flower Essence Society, Bach Flower Remedies and the Australian Bush Flower Essences. From Agrimony to Zinnia, benefits of each remedy are described in detail. You will learn:- What flower essences are- how we are informed by the doctrine of signatures- how flower essences are made- how and when to prescribe these natural remedies- the healing potential of each flower essence- and more""Excerpt from the back cover of Flower Remedies- feel better naturally by Mark Wells (naturopath and homeopath)"
3,A Better Manual Than The Manual With The Camera,"Essentially, this is a well written manual that helped clarify some of the operation of my Olympus E10 digital camera. It's sad you have to go to a book to get the information a product manual should provide. This is a manual for the camera. Do not buy thinking it gives you more information to do different camera techniques."
4,Good supplement to the manual,"This book includes boilerplate language on general photographic techniques found in other books in the series by the same author. What is extremely helpful, however, is explaining some of specifics on the operation of the E-10. I never would have figured out how to use the white balance settings based on the manual that comes with the camera--it is woefully incomplete. That section probably justifies the purchase of this guide."
5,Nice Necklace,It is a nice necklace and well made. I sent it back because the beads were too big for the pendant I had in mind to wear with it. It would make a nice stand alone piece because of it's length.
5,Seeing is believing,"I love the toe ring, it is very pretty and nice. I will buy again from Serenity Crystals"
4,Very comprehensive,"It is a detailed reference book, with lots of how-to, stitch pattern library and some projects. It also has alot of diagrams to show how the stitches are worked especially for some complex stitches. However, diagrams on some basic know-hows like grafting etc are missing altho it is covered in the text but it is ok as such info are readily available on the web or just ask someone. Overall, a very good & comprehensive book on knitting."
4,For all knitters libraries,This is a good book with beautiful stitch directions and every knitter will enjoy having this in their library of knitting resources.
2,violet,"This is definitely NOT an encyclopedia of knitting, but I like the book. Like most knit books that call themselves an encyclopedia, it gives you some stitches and the rest is patterns, but no in-depth information about knitting."
5,Great Knitting Book for every skill level!,"What a fantastic book for skill levels from beginner through advanced. It has great illustrations of every step to make learning basic stitches or advanced stitches a breeze. The combination of history, needle advice, detailed directions and illustrations make this a must have for every knitter!!I purchased this after reviewing Donna Kooler's ""Encyclopedia of Crocheting""...which is equally fantastic!"
5,A great help in understanding the Book of Hebrews,"If you want to thoroughly understand the book of Hebrews, you should get this book. The author first delves into the background of Hebrews--who its intended audience was, who wrote it, when, where, etc. Next, he explains the author's goals and how the author makes use of first century techniques of persuasion to reach his audience. Then, deSilva breaks Hebrews up into ten distinct passages, providing an overview, detailed commentary and summary for each. Important issues, whether theological, historical or cultural, receive special attention. In addition, deSilva provides great insights into how to apply the messages found in each passage to our lives today. This inspiring commentary will greatly enrich your understanding, not only of one of the New Testament's most difficult books, but also of Christ's work on the cross--work for which we should all be grateful."
3,For sports fans only,This was purchased as a present for our fifth-grade grandson and Mets fan. It should help him keep up with the schedule and times.
3,Crazy,"Hey live inside the craziness of James Franco, lol. If you are a Franco fan and would like to know how he would make a movie, than here it is. get a glimpse into his world lol."
1,The Ape; bad language,"I enjoyed Franco in the Spiderman movies so I decided to look up his other films and I bought this one because of the reviews given by others. The one thing that they don't tell you is that it is full of bad language throughout the movie (I guess but am not fully sure because I had to take it out twenty minutes into the film and throw it away). I can take an occasional ""sh.."", ""a.."" but this is full of ""fu.."" and ""GD"". I wish people would consider these things when they fill out their reviews. I have little children and consider this one very important factor when purchasing a movie."
4,better than a old towel,"It works just like it's supposed to. It does not interfere with my legs, like I thought it might. I use to use an old towel to keep the sweat off my bike, but sometimes it would fall off mid-ride or it would sweat through. I know, gross. I have seen bikes that weren't taken care of and you'd be surprised how much damage sweat can cause on your expensive bike."
5,Great and a great price,This fits my specialized secteur perfectly. Great to keep damaging sweat off my bike when training indoors in the cold NJ weather. Holds up well in the wash as well.
5,Best Lentils for Soup,These red lentils make the best lentil soup ever. Another winner from the great folks at Bob's Red Mill. I haven't found a product yet that they don't do best.
1,mushy,Disappointed with the red lentils because they cook down to a mush. No discernable shapes of lentils are present when finished cooking. Prefer dark brown or black lentils. Don't know if Bob's Red Mill offers them. Jean
4,Good commando action.,"""Missing in Action"" is the originator of all 80's military action movies. Chuck Norris, as burned-out Vietnam vet James Braddock, lives a tormented life knowing there are American troops still being held captive in Vietnam. Somehow he hitches a ride to Vietnam to meet with the Vietnamese General about POW's. Then he sneaks away, meets up with his old war buddy Tuck, and proceeds to equip himself and start to blow things up. Yes, it's mindless, but it's miles ahead of ""Sense and Sensibility."" For a full Norris experience, watch this movie, then ""Missing in Action 2"" and then ""Delta Force."" You'll be a better person afterwards."
1,Ground Chuck,"A one star for some movies means that it really sucks. But one star for a Chuck Norris movie, this Chuck Norris movie, means that it is one of his better ones. I thought Missing in Action was a pretty entertaining 80's action movie. Sure it is crap but it is fun and exciting. Chuck is a horrible actor and has never gotten better but this movie is not a bad flick. Compared to some of his movies this is a 5 star. Compared to other movies... it is a one star."
4,What's with all this anti-liberal stuff?,"I'm a liberal, but I enjoyed this movie. Well I enjoyed laughing at it. It really is just B level action flick, if you don't want to think you will have a great time. It was on TV while I was eating lunch at a holiday party and the sound was off. Chuck Norris is in Vietnam fighting terrorist."
3,A heavily biased review,"To be truthful, if it were any other person as the star, I'd probably give this no stars. But still, I have a special place in my heart for Chuck Norris. Most people know going into a movie like this that it is not driven by brilliant story telling. You want a fun movie where the hero kicks butt and takes names. Well, it takes a while before Chuck does those things. For me, its a let down because when he DOES serve up justice, its almost entirely with guns and explosives. This from the 6 time world karate champ & 8th degree grand master in taekwondo. I realize this is an 'action' movie and not a 'martial arts' movie, but Chuch could have at least thrown us a bone on this one.At the same time, I still love the feel of the whole 'We are America, screw everyone else' attitude. Pretty good fun for a lazy Saturday night."
2,could be better,"I must say big fan of the Missing in action series. As for the blu ray release of the first two movies i will say the picture quality is not bad i honestly dont expect much from these movies based on there age and the quality that it was filmed. I will say it looks great on my hd tv. I only have one complain and that is the audio quality, really mono dts you have to be joking me i at least got stereo on the dvd release of this movie come on you use a 50gb blu ray disc dont tell me you couldnt even add stereo. just on the audio alone is why i rate it 2 stars. if you are a big chuck norris fan or just like missing in action i cant blame you for wanting to get this on blu ray. I will just like to hope one day they release this movie with better quality audio."
3,A good Chuck Norris-film!,"I saw this film just some days ago. Norris is James ""Jim"" Braddock, a washed-up-old(38 years)-has-been-war hero. He believes there are still American soldiers in Vietnam. He goes there and kills an evil general. Then he looks up his old friend Tuck in a hooker's house in Bangkok to help him get back to Vietnam and rescue his fellow Americans. What I like about this movie is the scene where a man hides in Chuck's locker and gets thrown out of a window, just before Chuck is being attacked by bad guys with rocket launchers. There is also a car chase before Chuck sets off to the deep woods. A man with an axe attacks him on a boat, Chuck sends him to heaven with a quick remark. So far the movies quite good, but the fighting in the jungle is too short. It should have been longer. The film also ends too quickly."
3,Xplosive Review,"This VHS contains the Episodes 4,5 and 6 of the first season.Episode 4 is Mutant Cush which introduce Fred Dukes aka The Blob.Jean Grey was just helping him but Blob takes it too seriousl like a crush.Then next is Speed and Spyke which introduces Storm's nephew Evan Daniels and his nemesis Pietro Maximoff.Storm thinks Evan is having trouble with his powers and thinks he must go to the Xavier Institute.But he has some other plans besides that.He has to deal with a fast rival who keeps getting him into trouble.And last is Middleverse which introduces the old-young Forge who accidently trapped himself in a dimension called Middleverse and Rogue accidently transported Nightcrawler to Middleverse.This three will rock your spine!You will love this tape!"
5,x men evolution review,"I think the episodes were so,so cool. My favorite episode isspeed or spyke because it introduces the young Evan Daniel'sand he's my favourite character. I think you would really likeit. you face heap's of action and adventure. I think it's thebest."
4,just in case you were wondering what 3 episodes this include,"i don't think anyone else has mentioned this, but the three episodes on this video are:- mutant crush, feat. the blob and jean grey- speed and spyke, feat. spyke and quicksilver- and middleverse, feat. nightcrawler and forgethese were the orig. ep. 4-6 in season one of the evolution series and thus they were the first appearances of the blob (who gets recruited by mystique and who develops a crush on jean grey), spyke and quicksilver (former friends who get recruited by mystique and the x-men respectively), and forge who has been trapped in a place outside of time b/c of an invention gone slightly awry and who gets brought back when nightcrawler gets ported there.worth 3 or 4 stars, although these episodes aren't nearly as good as the later ones, such as the ones late in season one and season two. if i were going to get just one of the vhs tapes i'd get one of the other two first, esp. since both of those inc. an episode w/ rogue."
5,A modern day mystery with classic detective novel trimmings.,"Martin Edwards is a modern day mystery writer who is not averse to using classing detective story elements in his work. He has a good plot, a professional and amateur detective investigating, a very clever red-herring right at the beginning, and a few other surprises of the Golden Age genre along the way.A master gardener was murdered several years previously without the murderer ever caught. Then an anonymous letter to the police accuses the victim's wife of the murder. And other anonymous letters also appear. The way it all coalesces and develops is the story told by a modern master who never forgets he is a contemporay writer nor the legacy of classic detective fiction."
5,The Cipher Garden,"I first started reading Edward's books while in England, although Yorkshire, not the Lade District.I look forward to the settings and watching the main characters grow as the books move along.Having traveled through the Lake District many years ago, I can envision the places the stories take place in.I can't wait to go back again (in the books, as well as in travel."
2,Why so expensive??,"I love the Saint and I enjoyed watching the episodes contained on Set 1 of the Saint. However, I was terribly disappointed when I found out that Set 1 only contains 6 episodes. Effectively, the price for Set 1, is the same as an entire season of many other great shows. I think that this is a real rip off! I'm certainly not going to buy more Saint DVDs until the producer brings down the price to a more reasonable range."
5,Epitomizes the NY post-punk scene,"This sadly overlooked recording is a prime example of the vitality coming out of NY in the late 70s.Sort of New Wave, but not the wacky wildly dated sounds that characterize the genre.If you are familiar with the scene but missed this one (most people did), you should give it a listen. It's first rate stuff."
2,"Hard, small & uncomfrotable - PLUS way too expensive!",Wish I hadn't bought it. Nothing more to say really but the review requires me have a certin number words. There!
3,Not bad,Eddie proved that he can do a serious role. I was impressed by his acting and the movie was ok.
2,Blast not much of a blast.,"The movie is quite mediocre, but not as bad as you may think. The casting of Eddie Griffin as a tough action guy is ridiculous, to say the least. But the reason I bought this dvd is because Nadine Velazquez is so hot! She plays a villain, is incredibly flexible and does some great martial arts kicks. I hope she will be in other movies as the baddie, but in a much bigger, sexier, and action packed role. It's worth getting this movie if you love beautiful latino women, even though you don't see enough of her in the film."
3,Diehard type movie.,You know... terrorists/criminals take over a structure and there's one retired special ops type hero innocently on the inside. I will not waste your time describing the story any further as there's nothing new to tell. The action scenes are decent. The story moves along at a good pace. Character development is good for a pure action flick. Actors are all decent. Chemistry between the main protagonists threatens to ignite. It never quite does but it's entertaining enough to watch. Eddie Griffin pulls off the hero role well enough. He's not gonna be the best action hero but he's better than a lot of actors who try it. There's nothing special here but it's an entertaining movie for an otherwise boring evening.
3,DISCOUNT DIE HARD,"This straight to DVD action movie is as derivative as can be, but it's still entertaining enough to pass ninety minutes. BLAST follows a tug boat captain (Eddie Griffin trying hard to be Wesley Snipes) who is tugging an oil rig on the California coast, much to the chagrin of environmentalists. A group of these do gooders take over the oil rig and have something else up their sleeves, of course. Vinnie Jones sneers and leers as Michael Kitteridge, the head of this well organized group, with lovely Nadine Valesquez as his head honchette. Breckin Meyer is on board as a federal agent working undercover, and Vivica A. Fox is the sexy FBI agent trying to work out the hostage situation. Director Anthony Hickox keeps the action moving and Griffin and Meyer have a good comic rapport. Nothing new, but okay for a diversion."
3,Pretty Decent,"First of all, Eddie Griffin does well as an action hero, if you have not heard of him before, but otherwise you wonder why the switch? Second, the movie is obviously low budget, because you can see the ""green screen"" effects from a mile away (saves money). Finally, it had some good action scenes with a lot of ""cheese"" thrown in for good measure. I rate this movie a 3, but I do recommend it if you are looking to rent a basic action movie."
2,Don't listen to those with good reviews,"This movie is so substandard! Lukewarm plot that is so formula...I went to the bathroom, came back, and STILL didn't miss anything!The acting is so wooden, you could tell the editor used the slateboard and `cut!' signals as edit points.The ONLY redeeming factor is Eddie Griffin. His lines suck as much as Schwartzenegger one-liners, but the man did the best he had to work with.So here's the plot....retired black firefighter (an ex-fireman with combat skills? Puhlease!) has custody of dead white partner's son (what? there was no family for this poor kid!!!). Terrorists disguised as Earthfirsters take over oil rig. Eddie saves the day.Everything in between has been done over and over.Leave this poor skunk on the shelf. Don't even rent it. Wait for it to come on cable so you can fall asleep using the sleep control on the tv."
3,i hope this was strictly a comedy,"this movie was hilarious from beginning to end. this was obviously a low budget movie but it really didn't occur to me until this scene with a crane pushing a helicopter off the side of the oil rig did i realize how low budget it was. not to mention the close ups on eddie griffens face whenever it is supposed to dramatize the situation. this was close as it could get to undercover brother with those close ups as possible without making direct references to that movie.i hope the actors in this movie didn't take it seriously and it was just one of those movies that was made as payback for something in the past. overall, i don't know who to recommend this to because it was quite obviously unintentionally funny for an action movie."
5,A great collection of Sci-Fi!,"This is, by far, my favorite collection of science fiction stories. As the title states, this book showcases some of the best short story examples of the most common themes in the genre.The first theme showcased is that of Alien Worlds. Tom Godwin's ""Too Soon to Die"" is a riveting story that has you cheering by the end. Other authors include Roger Zelazny, Alan Dean Foster, L. Sprague de Camp, Fritz Leiber, Poul Anderson, Arthur C. Clarke, along with many, many authors of note.Frederic Brown's ""Answer"" will chill you. Robert Sheckley's ""Odor of Thought"" will intrigue you. J.W. Schult's ""The Santa Claus Problem"" will amuse you. Raymond E. Banks contributes a classic Space Opera theme story called ""Transstar"" that has all the gloriously cheesy qualities you would want in such a story.The cover reads ""Fifty Great Works of Science Fiction."" I couldn't agree more."
5,Wonderful Surprise,"One of my first SACD purchase I made from Amazon, having no idea who Mr Blanchard is and his style of music...However, what a wonderful surprise this has been and still the SACD is one of my favourite album. The stellar cast of singers and musician and the quality sound made this an excellent album to spin, especially late at night. For those with 'audiophilic' persuasion, an excellent disc to spin for your system."
5,Very well done,"I listened to the cd. Loved the rendition of ""Too Young To Go Steady"" so much that I went into the Vanguard to hear it live, as did the McHugh family. I noticed that they appreciated the vocal as well as I did. Get this cd."
2,Overrated film,"I bought this film to have one of its genre in my Japanese film collection. I was disappointed because this is not the same film described in Tadao Sato's book on Japanese film. It is directed by Kumashiro and of the correct 1974 vintage, but apparently the various Kumashiro films are different chapters from a book. If you buy it for the sex described in the product description you will be disappointed. And the political climate of the times is quite scantily dealt with as well. The English title is misleading because there are much better films dealing with aspects of the geisha world."
3,Fascinated with Geisha,"Ok, I bought this film and watched it a few days ago. For me, it's been hard to find films about geisha. This film portrays Geisha as prostitutes, plain and simple. There are a lot of sex scenes, which are totally NOT hot. Most of the sex scenes made me laugh. This film was made in 1974, and it has a sort of Austin-Powers-Meets-Geisha quality to it, although it's not MEANT to be funny.If anyone has any recommendations about other geisha movies, I'd be glad to hear them."
4,The World of the Fox,My wife and I enjoyed this book. The photos are excellent and the text is good.
1,One of Williamson's more forgettable works.,"I wanted to like this one, because Jack Williamson has always been one of my favourites. Alas, he has presented us with a rambling, disjointed tale, populated by characters that are more suited to grade-school space opera fantasies. He has no respect for the readers' intelligence, and feels that he has to exagerrate every character trait to make sure we know who the good guys and bad guys are.The story drags when it should move, and leaps over important parts with little more than a flat statement that something happened. Subplots are left entirely unresolved and uncommented on, leaving the reader wondering why they were mentioned at all.All in all, not one of Williamson's best efforts."
2,"Dull, predictable, and wordy.",My first Williamson story; I was not impressed. I felt the story was dull and wordy (could have been condensed easily into a short story)
1,black sun-less,"This was the most pathetic sci-fi book I have ever read. I have been reading sci-fi for over 45 years, and I am so mad that Williamson could write a book that apparently written for 10year olds or younger. He has no grasp of how people react to or with one another and is unable to put together a believable coherant story. My 15 year old daughter is able to write better than this person and I will NEVER read another of his books. I have 2 regrets; having read the book to the end; NOT being able to send this message to him personally!"
4,Spooky!,The Balck Sun was an intriguing story. I was truly with the passengers on the wavecraft waiting for lift off from earth. I could feel the tension of not knowing where you will end up. There were a couple of empty spots that left me wondering what was going on. Exactly how many people were on this ship? Only a few were described to us. There really seemed to be problem after problem for these traveling earthlings. One thing that seemed to be far fetched was that they sure had a never ending supply of food. I didn't want the poor people to starve but it would have added to the drama a little bit if they had that to worry about. For the most part the story was really entertaining. I liked the whole idea of not knowing where you will end up and what would you do when you got there. It kept me turning the pages.
3,Slow paced expedition,"As the translator of the hungarian edition of this book I read it twice. Well, certainly will not be my favorite. Not being a native I cannot know why Williamson's characters can only 'shrug' or 'shake their heads' for a million times, as if other english phrases did not exist. Moreover, one third of the book deals with the everyday life in the spider, whene did the characters eat, when slept, when did they climbed the steps to the bubble. Simple boring after a hundred pages. The last page lacks the usual 'to be continued' insert often seen in movies, since the story ends rather abruptly. On the pro side, I was fascinated by the complexity of the amphibian history, which gives some depth to the novel. To me the best part was Kip's dream as the Watcher, that chapter was simple unbeatable."
3,Almost a great book. A very good novel.,"I agree with the read who said the book was exciting but lacked depth. The story line was great, but slow. The end of the book seemed like it should be the beginning of a sequel. And I think I'd have rather read the sequel."
3,"Some good, some wandering thoughts.","This book is a mixed-bag. Some parts of it read very succinctly and directly, such as the author's definition of myth (primary and secondary), of fantasy, and of science fiction. But there are other parts that are wandering, a bit abstract, and one wonders whether they address the issue of myth and religion in Tolkien succinctly or squarely. The author will talk quite a bit about comparing or contrasting Tolkien to C.S. Lewis or Ursual Leguin, for example, and the analysis of Tolkien himself seems to take a back seat. There are some very good aspects to this book, such as the review of the religion and myth of the Silmarillion, and some of the personal letters and ideas of Tolkien. Altogether I would say there are some good and important observations on Tolkien in this book, but mixed in with a style that at times can seem rambling. So I remain somewhat lukewarm to this book."
2,I Tried To Like It,"I really did. I've heard so many good things about this book, so I went out and bought it. I loved the idea of it. I thought it romantic that a young man would go in search of a fallen star for the woman he loves. But the woman he loves is so obviously disinterested in him, I had to wonder why he even bothered. There were a couple times in the book I wanted to just forget it, but I forged ahead hoping it would get better. I'm sorry to say, for me at least, it didn't get better. Tristan and the star were the most interesting aspects of the book, but it wasn't enough for me. And the ending was so...blah. I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it, but I expected more of a reaction out of Tristan at the end regarding Veronica...Victoria? I've already forgotten her name. It just didn't do it for me."
3,STAR DUST,"IT WAS A GOOD BOOK. IT'S DEFFENETLY A FAIRY TALE. A FAIR TALE FOR ADULTS MIND YOU. IT WAS SMALL AND EASY TO READ. VERY INTERESTING CONCEPT FOR A BOOK. THE ILLASTATIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED WERE VERY COOL. I'M DEFFENETLY GLAD I READ IT, BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF I JUST RENTED IT FROM THE LIBARY. I DON'T THINK IT WILL ADD MUCH TO MY BOOK COLLECTION. ALL IN ALL I GIVE IT THREE STARS OUT OF FIVE."
2,Lighter than air,"Neil Gaiman is a wonderful writer and when I picked up Stardust and read the first few pages I was prepared to be enchanted. Unfortunately, the spell never quite took. There is so much to like about Stardust - the basic premise, the main characters, the descriptions both of the human town of Wall and the faery land of Faery. But for all its plots and subplots the story has no depth. It's like only being able to dip your toe into the pool on a hot day when you really want to dive in. As another reviewer here points out, everytime we appear to reach a crisis Gaiman gives the character an ""easy out"" and there's never any real denouement. Stars may be able to survive without substance, good stories can't."
4,"Kindle Version: Formatting Errors, Low-resolutions Images -- UNACCEPATBLE","The book is a lot of fun and worth reading.With that out of the way, the Kindle version is rushed. With typos, formatting errors, and extremely low-resolution images. Now that eBooks have been out for a while these sort of issues should have been sorted out. They haven't been. Complain with your reviews and make these problems known so we can stop this problem as soon as possible."
5,"Beautiful, perfect, magic book","""Stardust"" came as a real surprise to me. I don't like fantasy and I don't care for fairies and unicorns. On the other hand, I was told I'd like it (and I do love ""The Princess Bride""), so I agreed to read it.I decided I would just read the first chapter.I was hooked. It was like chocolate or ice cream, something rich and lovely that you never want to stop. What fairy stories must be like in a perfect world.I suppose it made me feel like a kid again. I loved the romance and the wonderful way Neil Gaiman puts words together. I wished I had someone to read it out loud to.Do yourself a favor, and read this book."
2,There's something missing here,"Stardust is one of the most remarkable books I have ever read. But this edition is sadly lacking because somehow, another publisher purchased the text only from Time Warner without the Vess illustrations. If you read this edition you will sadly miss much of the beauty of this book. By the way, this book was originally published as a comic book by Vess and Gaiman. Don't let this text only version fool you. You'll miss out on the beauty of Gaiman's prose as seen through the eyes of Charles Vess."
5,I'm Hooked!,"I'd never heard of Neil Gaiman. I picked up the book in the grocery store because I had read and reread all my Orson Scott Card books, and needed something new. This book absolutely blew me away. What a fabulous story! As soon as I finished it, I ran out and bought NEVERWHERE -- ALSO EXCELLENT! I am now a HUGE Neil Gaiman fan. I love his style of writing. This is truly a wonderful book!"
2,"Oh, no!!","Warning!!! The Paperback version has no illustration. If you plan to buy this book because of the illustration, do NOT buy the paperback. The Amazon preview of this book is not creditable. I am very disappointed withthe paperback version."
2,Watch the movie instead,"This is one of the few cases where I actually recommend watching the movie instead of reading the book. Maybe it's because I fell in love with the movie many times before reading the novel, but I just felt that the book was rather... odd. And not in a good way, like the movie is odd. Also, the ending is abrupt and anti-climactic, although I won't give any specific spoiler details.If you're a fan of Neil Gaiman, you might enjoy this book, but i really would recommend seeing it portrayed in film. They took a mediocre book and made it incredible."
2,Not as good as the movie...,"This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in reading a book after seeing a movie. Usually, the book is always better.... Lord of the Rings, The Golden Compass, and The Princess Bride just to name a few. Stardust, on the other hand, was a pretty bad novel. I found the characters in the movie much more interesting where as in the book they were fairly one dimensional.Overall, rent the movie and skip the book."
3,"Not Gaiman's best work, but still enjoyable","I will be honest - this is not Gaiman's best work. Mind you, I am not trashing him. I love his Sandman series, and have several of his novels... American Gods, Neverwhere, Smoke and Mirrors and loved them all, but this one was lacking.I will admit that I watched the movie first before I read the book, but it was startling to see that the movie had wonderful scenes in it that were not here in the book. The pirates, for one. I had been hoping to have a fun scene with them in the book, but they were practically nonexistent.I was also disappointed with the ending and liked the one in the movie better. I am very glad that these scenes for the movie was added, because if they hadn't, it would have been a less satisfying movie. The book felt rather bland to me, to be honest.Sorry, Mr. Gaiman. But this isn't your best work. That doesn't mean I will stop reading other books you write, though, because you have written quite a few excellent ones."
5,Stardust in my heart,"Read this a while ago, and the story is still fresh in my mind Every time I read it, I have such a a great visit to the town of Wall and behind the wall. There is magic in this story. I have yet to find a Neil GAiman book I dislike- and his style is so varied. I actually am a fan of the movie as well, and followed Gaiman's adventures in script writing and movie making from his blog."
5,Amazingly Entertaining,"It was simply an enjoyable read. Not necessarily a literary masterpiece, but you found yourself emerged in the story, and feeling emotions as I read. Laughing wondering, and generally just having a good time. While reading."
2,Expected a better storyline,"First of all I don't think this book is appropriate for children under 16...I think 16 is questionable, so I'm not sure why this book was published by Harperteen. The description of Tristran's conception was inappropriate and the intimate detail was not a necessary part of the story line. Also this is an almost singular case of watching the movie before reading the book, and 99% the book is always better, sadly this is not the case with this book. In my opinion, most of the changes made for the movie would have greatly enhanced the book. I'm not going to go into an depth review as there are numerous others that have already done so."
