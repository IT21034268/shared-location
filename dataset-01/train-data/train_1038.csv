2,Not for iPhone / iPad,"I own several printed versions of Ken Schultz's books and I would recommend all of them. This book is well written and organized.HoweverI bought this e version to keep on my iPhone and iPad when fishing for classification, but all of the prints are in black and white (as mentioned by several other reviewers) making classification difficult. I really wish the publisher would issue an update in color.I saw another reviewer say the same thing, but I went ahead and downloaded it just to see if it would display differently on the iPhone or the iPad, apparently the plates are B & W on all devices, what a disappointment.Unfortunately I cannot recommend this book based on the lack of color plates"
2,Sadly not for Kindle Fire,"This has descriptions of most common fish, but all the pictures are black and white. That is ok I guess for Kindle that is black and white, but for the Fire I just expected high quality color pictures. It was very disappointing."
2,A great book for college teachers but not secondary ones.,"I used this book for a graduate level course on Foreign Language Teaching Methodology given by my school district. I am a secondary level French teacher. The theories of instruction that this book explores are very enlightening, however the practical examples it offers are more suitable for university level instruction. My biggest complaint with this text is that the examples of communicative language teaching methods it offers are in English and are too vague to lend themselves to practical application. One is left wanting more specifics than the examples give, especially when the text advocates such activities as ""brainstorming"" or group input activities. For example, how can one brainstorm in the target language when that is precisely what one is trying to teach? I made lots of notes in my copy of the text, but I have not had success in applying what I've learned in my classroom."
2,arabic flavor electronic loops,More hypnotic loops. Seems sort of medium energy (think tool). Very simple beats in short sequences.
3,conflict zone,"the game is not a first person shooter .if your expecting something like operation flash point youlle be disapointed its closer to a microsoft close combat type of game . the detail is great and the graphic are too but you move your combatants with a mouse . the price isnt bad at all .it gets old very fast ,i logged about 3 hours before it went on the shelf."
1,Hames over the calf tube sock 6 pack,Not good advertised that the sock were 27 inches. They are not. It is absolutely necessary that my husband has very long tube socks. He has braces on both legs. These were not as long as advertised. Waste of money for me.
1,"Mid-Calf, NOT Over-the-Calf","I needed socks that are actually over the calf. I have some old tube socks that fit like that and from the tip of the toe to the hem, they're 28 inches. I didn't even have to try these on to see they were too short but I measured them anyway and they're only 23 inches. I'll have to give them to my nephew."
2,Hanes over the calf tubes,"The socks are very lightweight, probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books. They were just ok. I would not purchase again"
2,Poor Quality Socks,These socks kept sliding down the first day they were worn. They're not worth buying.
2,Half Calf,Got these because of the reviews but as it turns out the socks are too short. I wear a size 12 and they are too short for over the calf
1,Over calf? Not quite.,"The socks are good quality but only reach over ankle, might reach over the calf for a very short person."
1,Worst Socks Ever!,"My last over the calf sox where bought at Wal-Mart about 3 or 4 years ago. Just some off brand, not hanes or FTL or anything like that. A 6 pack has lasted me a good long time. The heels started to rip recently in most of those so I decided to throw them away and get new ones. These Hanes on Amazon looked like the perfect sock for the perfect price. FIRST WEAR THE HEELS SPLIT! again...FIRST WEAR THE HEELS SPLIT!!!!!"
1,Dont buy,The material got stiff after the first wash. Not what I had hoped for. Was hoping for something more flexible.
2,keep looking,I needed some socks to stay up and not fall into the abyss of my boots. These did not even come close. I was still getting ready to leave and these were rolled up around my ankles.
1,Poor Quality,"I was looking for tube socks, which no on seems to sell any more. I like the ones that are over the calf and although most advertise that they are, they aren't and this one was no different. Half way up the calf. It wasn't was I was looking for or promised from the advertisement as usual."
3,Socks are OK but Nothing Special,Socks are as desribed. If you have shoe size 11 or 12 these socks will be tight. Material is rather thin also.
1,Hanes over-the-calf socks,The body of the socks is thin. The elastic top small. They are not long enough; they come to mid- calf. The worse part is the do not stay up.
3,Pretty Decent Socks,"These socks are pretty decent. My only quarell is that your calf size is an issue with these, I have muscular calves so these socks fit a bit awkwardly at the top, they often over stretch and slip down, so I have to pull them up frequently, however they are good for their price."
2,Sock it to 'em,"Hanes briefs are fine, okay, good.Hanes sports socks are barely worth one-star. The crew socks fall down and wear out, 1-2, bang, bang. The over-the-calf-socks generally stay up, but barely last one wearing. Okay,rough heels: I plead guilty. I am not going to be guilty of buying any more Hane sports socks, made in the USA or no. Ubiquitous or no.The shortie socks last longer, re-enforced heel, but I always feel like they are about to come off. Okay, two stars for the shorties.I'm cheap. Going to see if Fruit of the Loom socks are any better."
1,money down the tubes,you buy hanes socks you will be buying again in two months because there will be holes in the heels.
2,Washed Up,Socks didn't hold up after a couple of washing cycles. Must continually pull up to keep above my boot tops.
3,Damn,"It is really really fun, a great price, but for me it is really hard. I got it because i watched Pewdiepie play it and i it looked fun, but i just get pissed cause i cant do that arrow, number key, thing."
3,Need to get out of the library,Hi I am a new gammer thanks to my son...I am having a great time with my first game Indigo Prophecy...but I cannot get out of the library. There is something I am doing wrong and not sure what it is...I choose he books and none seem the be the one the Asian book keeper is looking for. Can anyone help me with this. My email is wokkawoman@hotmail.com..Thanks....
5,Great horror survival game!,"This is one of the best horror survival games I've played... and I've played a lot. Though it doesn't live up to Silent Hill in game play itself, the graphics and storyline make up for it. Great voice acting, unbelievable views, and great music are also some of this game's highlights. I would have preferred more puzzles and more difficult game play, which is the only reason I didn't give this game 5 stars for fun."
4,Enjoyable to a point.,"Pros: Great Acting, story, plot, scenery and effects.Cons: Horrible controls they interfere with the enjoyment of the game and there is a possibility of destroying your keyboard."
2,Indigo Prophecy Review,"Ok, so this game was the best game I had ever played until about 2/3 of the way through it, then it became the worst game I had ever played. The infamous Indigo Prophecy syndrome exists, and this is where it all began...Story is excellent until the middle, and the mechanics are hard to master, but that is a good element to the game.As for buying the game? Probably not worth more than $20.00 maybe even less at this day and age.Thrilling and worth the effort to play, but looking it up on wikipedia is probably sufficient."
2,Great Music Destroyed by Annoying Vocals,"It's amazing how few people are disturbed by this wheezemeister's annoying noise that distracts the listener from the music. What a frustrating experience it is for me - just as you are starting to enjoy a great solo, as you watch its progression, that dreadful wheezing starts and knocks the bottom out of it. Arrggg!"
5,MUST HAVE FOR SERIOUS HANDICAPPERS,"I have read every serious book on handicapping I can find, and most of them end up gathering dust on the bookshelf after one or two readings - but not this one. This book is about money management and mathmatical probabilities of horseracing and for most horse players - that's where their game needs improvement. Afterall, if you handicap it right, and bet it wrong, the return will still be zero. Buy the book and then follow the advice - especially for Pick 3's, which is terrific."
3,Useful,"The book is a useful, nuts and bolts approach to money management at the track. Meadow insists on having wager value of a price greater than the expected probability of winning for all wagers at the track from win, place, show, to the exotic pools that are so mainstream today. There are some charts in the book that estimate probability of exactas based on the win probablities of the combinations. It's a good start for beginners and it's a good reminder of what investments a gambler needs to stay in the game long term."
1,There are good books . . .,"There are good books on horse race betting, this just isn't one of them. You do need to have deep pockets to follow this guy's advice, and a large bankroll at home."
1,"From 1990's , not current","I didn't pay much for this book, and that's about what I got out of it - not much. It's old and outdated, not from 2003. I recently bought 4 racing books, each were from a different POV of betting. This is supposed to be about money management. Some of it's OK, but it's directed at the bettor who knows ahead of time what the value is of a horse and will make a ""line"". Way too many ""formulas"" for mathematicians. Pick 6 was full of columns and columns of numbers. You get the idea. I'd give it 2 stars but the publishing date ""error"" makes me not want to."
5,Canines on Patrol,I really enjoyed reading this book. It shows the love of a dog and great friendship between Jerrod and Sadie. I believe that kids all over will enjoy this book. And will learn a lesson or two. The Author has a great sense for animals. She love of animals is great and I hope it passes it on to kids as well as adults.
1,Not a fan of singer's voice,"I had a hard time listening to this CD that we received as a baby gift because the woman's voice sounds like she's singing in too high of a note. I'm very particular about what our children listen to and really can't recommend this music. The songs themselves are absolutely beautiful, but I wish the singer would have sung in a lower tone."
2,"Very soothing, but...","The music is lovely and soothing. The lyrics, for the most part, are profound and meaningful, but are occasionally sad and occasionally preachy. What bothers me most about this CD is the lullaby for the innocents, never to be sung. It's a poem printed in the book and CD jacket, and is a sort of requiem for aborted babies. I did not like thinking of aborted babies every time I put the CD in (listed as sort of the last track). Further, I would never give this as a gift to anyone who lost a child to miscarriage, my best friend being one of those people - her much-loved and desired little one also could not be calmed by her lullabies and is far beyond her reach. I think Michael Card was just not thinking of those poor women when he put in his requiem, and it would be heartbreaking for anyone who ever lost a child to read this poem."
4,Like it but I love the Angels All Around by GENIE,"THis is a prety nice CD, really super Christian churchy and all but nice. Michael Card is a great writer. Michael doesn't sing on this CD. It's a lady who has a nice but kinda churchy voice.I would definitely get ANGELS ALL AROUND by Genie.IT calms your baby and keeps them asleep and is very soothing for you to listen to, not babyish or boring at all.I suggest you get them both and alternate as you feel appropriate."
3,Let Down,"I thought that his CD was going to have more of a boost to it. It turned out that it actually brought me down rather than bring me up. It does have good rythms, but I would't recomened that anyone try listening to this particular CD to get an ""energy"" boost."
5,love this album,"If you are expecting, have a child, or want to fall back min love with why God wants us to come to Him like children, this is a wonderful album. The scripture based lyrics are a wonderful way to call blessings onto children of all ages and stages!"
5,Gold Amongst a Littered Field,"There are so many books in the trauma field it is hard to know which one to invest precious time reading. I highly recommend this book, for several reasons: 1) it is clearly written in a down-to-earth style, 2) it provides an integrated framework for understanding and working with various experiences of trauma, 3) it offers specific tools for helping people overcome the effects of trauma."
2,"Great Idea, but...","Thought watch was beautiful online. Very different. In person, it justs looks a little strange. Quality is so so. Watch more for the ""hip-alternative"" type person."
3,"Good, if you're into that sort of thing.","This is abstract football at it's best. Imagine taking a third grade game of touch football and swapping out the players with inmates from the violent crimes ward at Joliet. Crushing hits and intense stylings make this game seem and play like something it isn't, but it's true to it's arcade counterpart. If you prefer a more realistic sports sim, go with NFL 2K, but if you like stylized arcade-isms, go BLITZ!"
5,GREAT GAME,has great game play its very simple if you dont want to play a game where you have to hit all these buttons to throw the ball also if you like this game you will like NFL2K1
1,Unrealistic and Pathetic,"This game is a sorry excuse for a football game. If you like wrestling, it might be of some interest, but it bears no similarities to actual football"
3,"Good Movie, with some bad acting.","Purchased for Rooftops, since it is not available on any streaming services at this time. Good Movie even if some of the acting is bad."
2,A pile of #2 for the price of 1,"Two truly average movies all in one glorious 2-sided disc, what more could you want? Rooftops answers the age-old question of what could be better than combat? Capoeira, of course! Meanwhile, on side A, some of Hollywood's brightest young stars (and by this I mean absolutely the opposite) gather to put their own unique spin on Shakespeare's classic. By ""unique"" I mean pointless and unnecessary, this movie sucks, and so does Rooftops."
3,good and bad,"the game has very good graphics and it looks really cool but the game itself is very hard to learn. In the beginning, you can go through a training scenario except when the person instructs you what t do, he seems to do it out of place. Like when he tells you to turn at a cetain point, he seems to say it very late. Also, the game is very challenging and it is very complicated but otherwise a good game."
4,sim pilot,"I like the historic cd that comes with it. The terrain down low looks like JetFighter 3. That is the only down fall I noticed. I use my CH Flight stick control. Most keyboard controls are like most other flight sims. This is an older game now. If you like easy to fly and land planes, this is for you."
1,Shame Shame,"This tape can hardly be understood and it was listed for sale as ""very good"". It's VERY BAD."
4,"Good, but, like cigars, not for children.","What's not to like about science articles?Reuters Science has, not surprisingly, readable and interesting science news. There is little overlap with AP Science, which I also get. Both are informative, but AP is clearly more ""PC"", so they present, for example, the PC version of how there is global warming consensus, and that it is clearly human caused, etc. Reuters doesn't come across as though it has an agenda.As I said, there isn't much overlap and so, for example, Reuters covered the memristor story, but I didn't (yet) see it in the AP Science blog.One warning about Reuters Science though. It may not be suitable for that young reader you've given a kindle to. I had to cancel it on that kindle because of an overly descriptive story, ""turn-ons, turn-offs, desire varies widely among men."" That's what prompted me to write this review. No surprising conclusions in the story, no real science to report, just a big inappropriate in-your-face faux pas."
5,A readable synthesis,"Great book, read it multiple times. Great synthesis of theory and empitical work. Anyone interested in population biology should read it."
4,A Great Deal for Many Great Games!,"""ALPHA, GO..."" GO ON, AND CLICK THE ""Add this item to your cart"" button! These are all great games! There isn't much variation between them, so if you dont get bored of the same ""rescue the hostage"" deal, than you'll love commanding a team and leading them. I really like the music in the game! While your making a complex map of where your team will go, you can tap your foot to some cool music. Also, in the actual game play, it becomes like a movie where you hear the scary music creep in. I have noticed some glitches.. mostly when you try to go up stairs. Sometimes, I would fall through and get stuck. (Maybe my guy should've laid off the doughnuts) A GREAT Game overall! One more CON, is that it has the US as the good guys and any other country as the bad guys. Like our country is perfect... Ha!"
5,Extremely Realistic!!! One of the best games ever!!!,This is an excellent game. It is very realistic and the guns and locations are amazingly close to the real thing!! Rainbow Six has 16 missions; Rainbow Six Eagle Watch (add-on) has 5 missions; Rogue Spear has 18 missions; Rogue Spear Urban Operations (add-on) has 5 missions; Covert Ops has 3 missions plus 6 training missions. It is awesome. (All games talked about included +Covert Ops Additional Intel)
4,Neuro-scientific vindication of psychotherapy,"This review is an update of my previous one from 2001. From both a psychodynamic and a neurological perspective, Vaughn shows us the inner workings of psychotherapy. Thanks to neural plasticity, successful psychotherapy can modify neural pathways and brain structure. Support for this can be found in the way dreams change in the course of successful psychotherapy. During REM sleep, the reticular formation is activated and, as neurons from that area are fired, habitual story themes are cranked out that reflect a client's Core Conflict (as described by Luborsky). As successful psychotherapy progresses, dreams change; i.e., the Core Conflict changes, which in turn indicates that the neurons fired from the reticular formation are being fired in a new, different way, with fresh pathways and patterns. Yes, good psychotherapy does work, and it does change the brain."
4,Analytical without Boredom,Susan makes her case very well in this intriguing book. Frankly it was exactly what I expected and was looking for ... a technical discussion of the process of change at a physiological and emotional level.Even if you dont agree with her ideas it is hard to say she doen't present well.
5,Very helpful book for a layreader,"I was very excited when I recently found this book. Having studied cognitive processes and most of the recent professional journal articles on memory recovery, I was very surprised that the author's theories - written in 1997 - are now being confirmed left and right! Better yet, she explains the concepts in simple ways that nearly anyone can understand. She's right; there is no Wizard of Oz hiding behind the curtain during therapy sessions. Clients need to be taught how their cognitive and memory processes work. Armed with that knowledge - as provided in Dr. Vaughan's book - those clients may experience the new, delicious, empowering sensation that they - not their therapists - are in control of their own minds and lives."
5,Romantic,This was a wonderful book! Very romantic and a great love story. You won't be able to put it down!!
1,Be very careful,These instruments have nothing whatsoever with an original Aboriginal didgeridoo. They are mass-produced in Indonesia and as mentioned are made from a notorius cracker Bamboo. An aboriginal didgeridoo is mostly from termite eaten log -brach of a tree (eucaliptus) which Aboriginal crafstman works into an instrument.I strongly advise against such terrible instruments and encourage those interested to go find an authentic stick for their own satisfaction as well as the respect for the true owner of this wonderful instrument. Avoid mass produced sticks. Respect Aboriginal men.
5,Celebrating Children a winner,"I heard this group sing at a large gathering in downtown Los Angeles. The audience was entranced. The children have lovely voices and a rare degree of professionalism.The original songs are melodious and clever. Some incorporate the poetry of published authors.All in all, this album is a winner!"
5,The catchiest children's tunes I've ever heard.,"Once you hear this cd, you'll be humming the songs nonstop. It's perfect to keep the kids amused during car trips and they love hearing other kids singing the catchy songs. I've been a fan of Mrs. Music for a while, my family enjoys her first CD ""It's Holiday Time"" just as much as ""Celebrating Children."" Once your kids hear it they'll definitely be hooked."
4,"Smells Yummy, Crickets Like It",Smells yummy citrus. The crickets like it and devour it before they are devoured by our lizards. Good product overall. I have used several other Fluker's products all ordered on Amazon and I'm very satisfied with their quality.
4,great qaulity,i like this because it is good quality at a low price come on its three times less than at the pet store order it from here its great
2,Just use Windows Media Player for playback,"Looks like an interesting peice of software but it did not fix the screen overlay problem found on the OEM version shipped by Dell. In the end, Windows Media 9.0 fixed the issues I had with playing DVDs on my high end laptop. Probably a great tool for video editing but adds little value for just videa playback."
3,Win DVD 7 Gold for Laptop,"Only works sometimes on laptop. Seems to lockup and I have to reboot my computer. Some movies seem to work fine, while others I have trouble with."
4,Classic De Palma,"Blow Out is another of Brian De Palma's Hitchcockian-esque yarns, and it's definitely one of his best. John Travolta plays a Philadelphia sound technician who's stuck making sound effects for low budget horror films. One night, he's out collecting some sounds, and he becomes a reluctant witness to a tragic accident which kills a Presidental candidate. He soon learns however, thanks to the recording he was making at the time, that it was no accident at all, and he becomes trapped in a deadly web that also involves a hooker (Nancy Allen), a sleazy photographer (Dennis Franz), and a homicidal killer (John Lithgow) who holds all the cards. Like all of De Palma's 80's films, Blow Out is dated as can be, but his camera techniques are superbly done, and the cast, in particular Travolta and Lithgow, are electric. Blow Out is classic De Palma all the way, and it's denouement makes it all the sweeter."
4,ONE OF DE PALMA'S FINEST,"'Blow Out' is one of my favourite De Palma films, right after 'Dressed To Kill'. John travolta and Nancy Allen are perfect. I adore these two actors and there's something alluring about these two characters they play. De Palma's use of direction he takes the film is superb and the musical score is astounding. A must see for DePalma fans.By Justine Ryan"
4,Intriguing,"Interesting but derivative thriller concerning a sound-effects guy (John Travolta) who becomes involved in a murder mystery when he accidentally records a car crash killing a would-be candidate for governor. He befriends the candidate's mistress (Nancy Allen) and they team up to provide evidence as to whether he was killed or died by accident. DePalma borrows heavily from other, superior sources (""Rear Window"" and ""The Conversation""), but he still makes this film fun to watch. It drags in some areas, but you're always intrigued and you're left wondering what's going to happen next. However, while DePalma's other 2 films, ""Carrie"" and ""Dressed to Kill"" got loaded with features, ""Blow Out"" only has a trailer. I guess this is because it was the least successful of the three films, but movie buffs and casual viewers should still check out this one. (Trivia: Travolta and Allen already appeared together in another DePalma film: ""Carrie."")"
2,Dissapointing,"I love movies from the 70's. The Conversation, All the Presidents Men, The Parralax View to name just a few. I had not seen this movie and looked forward to watching it. Too bad it was not very good. The acting was o.k. (Travolta was very good) but the story had so many holes in it I had stopped caring what was happening halfway through. With the exception of John Travoltas character nobody else stuck out as being interesting at all. A few things that might have helped. A decent soundtrack. The music was terrible and did not make you feel the least bit of tension. It sounded almost out of place within the movie. Travolta driving like a madman through a parade without any regard for the people he almost killed and never gets in trouble, even jumping out of the ambulance. The movie ends and you never even know who was responsible for the murder to begin with."
2,Big Blow of Disappointment,"Had never seen Brian De Palma's Blow Out but became aware of it through the Criterion site prior to its release on Blu Ray.Good cast and a really interesting premise hooked me in. Comparisons to 'The Conversation' and 'All The President's Men' added to my interest.So, I purchased the Blu Ray. Well, I'm sorry to say I hated it!The script and acting are generally awful. John Lithgow is the best thing on screen. I often like old seventies and early eighties movies for their 'look' but I was even left disappointed from that point of view. I found the score to be lacklustre, but at least for an early 80's pic it didn't enter into poxy synth territory.Finally I was underwhelmed with the Blu Ray transfer. The scenes in the mob car look terrible and bear no match to other dark/black/night scenes in the movie - what's the story with that?My copy of Criterion's Blow Out on Blu Ray - coming to an Ebay page near you soon."
2,An easy film to sum up...,"Just repeat the following several times.1) Draggy plot2) Uninspired acting, especially Allen, who almost sinks it3) unimaginative (story, direction, etc)Then get a Hitchcock film."
3,CRITERION is lousy,"The movie is great.The transfer is, well, sufficient as to make it worth buying the movie in Blu-Ray format.CRITERION chooses to make their editions LOUSY.No subtitles? Most BluRays nowadays take advantage of the technology by presenting their products with subtitles in a wide number of languages.What about deaf people? What about foreign people? What about French-Canadians?A huge number of people living in NorthAmerica don't speak English.How can the people of CRITERION be so selfish and self centered as to neglect the movies to an ultra wide audience?The BluRay association AND AMAZON.Com should demand some standards to those who produce and sell these products."
1,Criterion Collection,There are a very good movies into the Collection but there are limited for the lack of subtitles in other lenguages
1,I agree with LF,"Such a bad film. I remember laughing out loud at ""It's a good scream."" Such bad memories.For some reason, I thought de Palma had promise. This monstrosity cured me of that disease.At least this is better than Scarface, which was violence pornography.Bad, bad, bad."
4,Solid paranoid thriller,"The Bottom Line:Blow Out is a fine thriller-ized take on Antonioni's Blow Up, with an appealing John Travolta in the lead and sufficiently creepy villains trying to prevent him from exposing the truth about a supposed car crash; Nancy Allen does hurt the movie with her awful performance (that showcases none of the winning qualities she displays in Dressed to Kill) but it's still one of DePalma's better films.3/4"
4,A Good Buy at Amazon's Price!,"The case is well made and designed and suits my camcorder and accessories perfectly. I wish the shoulder strap hooks were metal instead of plastic, but it seems sturdy enough anyway."
5,Very helpful!,"This book is fun and paced so that your child can ""jump in"" wherever they need some extra help or understanding. After doing plenty of pages in this (big) book, your child will definitely have a firm grasp on the subject of money."
4,...and people wonder why small towns are small,"Growing up in a small town myself, everyone heard the local ghost stories. Reading this brought back all of those memories with haunting precision. I felt as if I was one of the characters in the book. This book will not allow you to ever go past a graveyard with confidence again. Thinking the whole time that 'something' may be in there. Watching. Waiting. And planning its next move....A future classic other works will be compared to. A definite must buy!"
1,Another Mac port gone wrong,"Thought I would finally get a decent rally game on the Mac and was totally disappointed. While everything looks good the steering is absolutely unusable. The dead zone just does not set correctly so you have to throw the wheel back and forth to get any sort of response. This surprises me since the Ford Racing works so well.I see from other reviews and chat forums that this is a common ""feature"". Emailed support twice with no response.Definitely would not recommend this until a patch is released. Then I am sure things will be as promised."
2,a insult to clive barker,"candy man 2 is a lifeless rehash of the classic barker fstory the forbidden ,,,i"
4,good sequel,"this one has Tony Todd reprising his role as the Candyman. good horror and the story drags here and there but its fast going and enjoyable nontheless. Todd knows how to stick it to the people, especially in the beginning where the guy is sliced in the bathroom. other scenes like when the cop chants the guys name in the mirror and suddenly he is hooked and he is thrown out of the window, then the brother of the woman gets shot down I thought was a highlight in the movie. it tells also of how Candyman came to be, he was a slave and they caught him with some guys daughter, they tortured him and cut off him hand(thats where his hook comes in at) then they rub honey all over him and the bees just start crawling on him. its pure fun if you can stand the slow pace and some wooden dialouge but in the end it pays off."
2,"Mirrior, Mirrior, whos the scariest of them all??","Candyman Farwell To The Flesh is very dissapoint- ing and unsurpsing. It is dissapointing and it was no where near as good as the first one. The only reason why it got 2 stars was because it had the same music from the first one, and the begining was good, only because it has characters from the first one. Expect better?? Candyman 3 Day Of The Dead is very good, and the best Candyman sequel."
4,Decent thriller,"The first Candyman movie was the best in the trilogy, hands down, but this is actually a decent sequel. In the first film, the main character was the resurrection of Candyman's love, but the protagonist in this film is the descendant of the child that was spawned between the man who would later become Candyman and said love, a white woman who was the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner.I liked this film because it offers insight into Candyman's past and reveals more of how he came to become the dreaded Candyman (including the origin of the very name itself) along with Candyman's association with bees, and the reason he had a hook for a hand. Ever hear the expression 'skeletons in the closet'? This movie explores the skeletons of the family that descended from Candyman, as well as exploring the relationship between the two star-crossed lovers. Definitely a good sequel to the first 'Candyman'."
4,Not as good but still effective,THis entry in the Candyman series is actually not as bad as one may think. This time the story revolves around a woman (as usual) who is a direct decndent of the cnadyman. She doesn't know this at first. SHe finds out more about this after her brother is arrested blaming the Candyman for the crimes. The woman summons him sometime along the lines and he is going about the task of seducing her and taking her back with him. IT is in tehis entry that we discovered he had a daughter with teh woman he loved. In the end it is revealed that his power is in a mirror that his girl had.THis is an effective entry but not as much of an impact that Cnadyman had. Still decent though.
4,Very good sequel,"The first candyman is a great scary movie. So here you are candyman 2... If you have not seen this movie you are probablly thinking just another sequel I will pass on this one. WELL DON'T! After seeing this movie on TV one night I was very pleased. The storyline is great, acting is very good and candyman is just as horrifying. This sequel is about candyman tracking down his bloodline and in this movie you get to see what really happened to him. This is not just another sequel, there is something special about it. Check it out you will not be dissapointed"
4,this one was better than the first one,"really good.a little cheesy horror,but good.i was like,totally freaked out by the first one and couldnt sleep for days.but i just saw this movie last night on sci fi and was scared no more.i thought it was so good,i taped it.cause it was on twice in a row I think"
2,"Ok, but not really worth looking at","Candyman isn't as creative with his hook murders as he was with the first. Lots more gore and people getting gutted, but not nearly as entertaining as the first. The same as most of Clive Barker's sequels, lacks imagination."
3,not better than the original,it was kinda scary in a way like the beginning the thing that doesnt make it scary is because he doesnt have the voice. The cool part is when he opens up his jacket and bees come out.
2,Sequel,"Break the mirror- break the curse. A white woman had an affair with a black man, who gets his hand chopped off and killed by bees after being glazed with honey. ""Sweet is the sweet,"" the crowd said and gthey said ""candy man"" five times. If you say ""candy man"" in a mirror five times supposedly he would appear. His soul was trapped in a mirror. Wher the first Candy Man was scary, this sequel explains its origins. They raised Candy man's child as a white girl and no one suspected a thing. Not really scary, but suspenseful."
2,The Corney Candyman seequel,"Candyman: Farwell To The Flesh is a dissapointing and chessey sequel. The cast is good, the story isn't, and the setting isn't orignal. The film could of been better and it was no where near as good as the first one, but the third Candyman movie is better. This film isn't all that great but I recommend it, and I only gave it two stars because the beginging was good because it had details from the first one."
3,ok sequel with some chilling moments,"canyman was truly a classic horror film and although this sequel comes with a great start, it crumbles under its own weight. The first 10 minutes are genuinely creepy, but after the first half hour, you will find yourself somewhat bored. The suspense scenes are too far and too inbetween, you'll find yourself wishing that soemthing would start happening. Only the first ten mins. and the last three are worthwhile. The climax is pure cheese,but the performances are good. Worth watching only if you're a fan of the origina. But get ready to be dissappointed. Even the HBO sequel, Canyman 3 was better!"
2,Candyman: Farewell To The Box Office.,"This has to be one of the worst movies i have seen in my live of loveing horror films. CANDYMAN 1 was a god film and i had big hops for this one, but waht can you get out of must sequels these days. It's nothing to original, but it thalls you how Candyman became candtman etc, etc. And it had some good gore scenes, but only see this film win you have a movie to see you know is good.Rated R for horror Violence and Language."
2,A sequel...need I say more?,"As if the first was'nt bad enough and even now a 3rd candyman film is out with yet the same kind of plot. Tony Todd is good as the baddie, but these films lack originality, sure you may say I'm just a reviewer what would I know, I could'nt do better, but in fact I can, I've come up with better ideas.Sequels can be good and in some cases better ie; TERMINATOR 2, ALIENS but this candyman 2 is just very weak and the best bit in the whole film was the end scene where he breaks like a mirror into a thousand pieces."
2,HORRIBLE,I JUST DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE OR THIS SERIES. I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME
1,sucky,i had accidentilly rented it along with the surgeon (boring) and mistaked it for the first one. i got mixed up with both movies (rented 1 and 2) and found the only conclusion is to watch them over again and found that the second had a worse plot. the first though (i think)(i hope) from what i have seen had a plot as a college person and went to discover candyman she had done the thing saying his name 5 times forgetting to let him out and he started framing her
3,"My thoughts on ""Teen Berries""","When I saw this book in my school library I just picked it up thinking it would be just like all the other ""chicken soup for the soul"" books. This book is about life, love, friendship, and tough issues of a teenager. This book really touched me with all the stories. I believe this book isn't as good as any other ""chicken soup for the soul"". But the writings are up there. They still touched me. Some made me cry, some made me laugh, and some made me mad. I recommend this book to other teens that are going to these problems of life."
1,What a Rip Off,"I bought this book because I saw it advertised with the other Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul books. I still don't know if it is part of that series but if it is something went terribly wrong. I loved the other books, but honestly this one stank. I could not even read more than a few stories. Then there is this dribble in between stories that they didn't do in the other ones. Someoen please tell me...is this a Chicken Soup book?Or is it a rip off? Whatever you do ..don't buy it, stick to the ones by Jack Canfield and Kimberly Kirberger."
3,A Few Shinning Moments,"Taste Berries For Teens was just like any other ""Chicken Soup"" book. If you do not tire from reading these stories of hardships and achievements,then Taste Berries For Teens is great for you. Though, I found it a bit dull; it did have its shinning moments. The shinning moments in the book were brief and strong. Taste Berries For Teens made me become a slightly better person."
1,uugghh,"When I saw this book I was really excited because I thought ""another chicken soup for the soul book!"" Well I was wrong! I couldn't believe how corny and fake the stories were. and the themes created by the authors throughout the chapters made it even worse. The book claims to be original but it is really a take off of the chicken soup for the souls and an awful one at that! i havent even finished the book yet and i don't think i ever will! if you want to read REAL stories by real teens then the chicken soup for the soul books are the way to go!! not these books!!"
1,DUMB STUPID BORING RIP OFF,this in no way AT ALL compares to chicken soup for the teenage soul books...this was a boring book didnt keep mya ttention at all..didnt like the way it wa slayed out how they did it..stories..etc...i give it two thumbs down
5,An ispirational book for all ages.,"I really enjoyed this book. It has stories about love, friendship, parents, and popularity. Even if you are not a teen you will love this book! The stories are uplifting and joyful, yet sometimes a little sad. If you liked Chicken Soup for the Teen's Soul you really need to read this! I highly recommend it and hope you will enjoy it as much as I did."
2,"All distractions aside, this book just doesn't cut it","This book promises the same sort of inspiration and relevance to young people as the Chicken Soup for the Soul books but it fails to deliver. I think, similar to the Teen Love series, this book tries too hard to offer something more than the Chicken Soup books that it does itself a disservice... the author attempts to add in extra sections in between the stories that only come off as condescending. Whilst some of the stories are worth reading, none of them managed to stir up the same emotion and feelings as the Chicken Soup series and if you are looking for this type of book, I strongly suggest you look towards the Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul series which now features over 5 excellent books full of encouragement, originality and inspiration."
1,51 bad plans,"This book has fifty one plans. About 5 are less than 2,000 total s.f. About 8 are between 2,000 to 2,400 total s.f. The rest are over 2,400 s.f. up to 4,000 s.f. Most are a 60's contemporary design with 1,550 s.f. each side. Also, almost every plan had a garage for each unit."
5,Excellent for Woodworking,"This is a good, strong vise that is easy to tighten and loosen. The lever swivels very smoothly and is large enough to give you a good grip. The overall design is excellent. The way the mounting holes are positioned, you can mount the vise on the edge of your workbench so it has a fairly low profile. This means that the vise is very unobtrusive, staying out of the way, yet providing access when you need it. The inside of the mouth is smooth. However, I taped some padding on it to make sure it doesn't damage wood. If you're a woodworker, this is the best kind of vise to get."
3,njbulitka,"I found this book to be a little on the thin side in terms of detail. I was hoping for a more detailed treatment of unit testing in general, and the various Frameworks available. For an introduction/detailed treatment of unit testing, you want to get another text. For an overview of various types of unit test frameworks, this book is OK."
5,"Great, nice and simple for my 2 yo","My little man loves this book! I have since tried to find another Sesame Street book as good, but they're all too complex- with pics or words. This one is perfect for his age."
4,Here is a chance to run under Linux!,"Great series. My all time favorite was Ultima 4. With Wintendo 3.1/95 as the requirement for the OS, I'm thinking of trying to make this work with WINE under Linux (maybe even use transgaming if that fails).Then I can make it work with my MythTV Mythgames. My kids are in for a surprise :-)"
5,How can they get away with charging this much for this?,"Now, don't get me wrong, I've always been an AVID fan of the Ultima games. In fact, Ultima 8 is what got me into game programming myself. However, at $89.90 for a used copy of this, that's downright highway robbery. I got A FREE copy of it with Ultima 9, which costs $20!At any rate, only fans of the ultima series are likely to jump on this one. If you enjoy Ultima Online, I'd strongly recommend you go back to the origins and see where Ultima sprung up from. My particular favorite was the last in the series, Ultima 8.Keep in mind that some of these games are over 20 years old, so don't be expecting graphics at ALL in some cases. More interestingly is reading the documentation files that come with the CD to see how Lord British (the founder of the series) started with Akalabeth, a game that only incredibly vaguely resembles Ultima, selling copies of it at his college on 5 1/2"" floppies in sandwich bags!-Javin"
3,Amazing Personal Stories,"This book is one of the best books depicting the horror and determination of the Jewish people and supporters. It incites hatred and disgust on a whole new levels for the Nazi's and their followers, and also brings a real like look at the Jews in the camp; playing chess, falling in love and escaping with extreme courage.The book, however, is at times a little confusing with time periods and events, rather than staying in chronological order I wish the auther would have stuck with characters instead. I would read about someone in Chapter 1, then in Chapter 10 and have to go back and reread saying ""Oh ok him."" I would also have to reread certain sections because it was with history, personal, political agendas mixed in. I understand the author's wish for extreme detail and the many characters necessity but the flow of the book would throw me off time to time.Over all a good read and an even greater story of heroism."
5,Excellent,"Words are not effective in reviewing this book. It is heartbreaking to learn of what occurred at Sobibor; it is unimaginable, unthinkable. As a Jewish woman, I wanted to know more about WWII and have read many books; this one being unique in that it was solely about Sobibor. It was painful to read of the cruelty - not an accurate word - the evil - that had been forced upon the Jewish people in this camp. Their will to survive was amazing. A tough book - not fiction - all fact - and difficult to comprehend that other human beings could be so inhumane. This book opened up my eyes to the excruciating and extreme cruelty towards the Jewish people more than any other. If you want to learn, to be informed about a death camp during WWII, this is for you. It was excellent."
5,personal bond between the reader and human lives involved,"I am so glad the people whose lives are told about in this book were willing to share there personal histories with us the reader. I am also greatful for Richard Rashke for the time and energy spent researching this book to bring it to life. The people in this book will touch your heart and you will find yourself thinking of them as people you know and care for and cry for and pray for even still. Even though many books have been written of holocaust survivors,every one deserves to be read,no matter. They speak out for the living as well as the dead. We must never forget,and we must read books such as this one to keep them alive in our memories."
2,Canon i80 Printer,"The i80 printer shipped quickly and I love the size and efficient way it prints. However, after using it for a short period of time the printer is not performing as well as I thought it would. When I replaced the ink cartridges the color was faded and when doing a cleaning I still have the same problem. Sheet feeding seems to be an issue at this point also. I'm using it as a second printer because of these problems. You get what you pay for."
4,Great for light duty travel.,"I've owned this little printer for maybe 6 years and, while I've not used it a lot, have never had a real problem with it. I bought it for quick printing while traveling and it excels at that. Occasionally, when you plug it in, my Dell 600M has trouble finding it, but a restart gets it running. I've had no trouble with ink drying out even though my uses have been 6 to 8 months apart. The little cartridges don't print a lot of pages, but they do what needs to be done. Very light although slightly bulky, but way better than lugging the old HP along."
3,Working so far... looks very used.,I bought this to replace one that stopped working for no apparent reason after printing maybe 100 pages. I recived this one and it was in ok shape but looked like it has been around the block a few times. It was very dirty and scratched up perty badly I just hope it lasts longer than the one i purchased new.I haven't checked the ink resivor tank to see if it will need a reset but i can do that myself when needed and I have the one from the old printer.So far it works and that is why i bought it I also used the battery and bluetooth adapter from my broken one if the batt. and adapter would have worked on canon's newer model I would have gotten one of thoes instead.
1,Printer Heads Dry Out,"I agree wholeheartedly with Mark Page-Botelho's review. This printer is not for regular use. I had the same problem with the black print head drying out. The available maintenence functions have not been helpful, and the Canon service reps advice similarly has lead to a lot of wasted time and frustration, along with a lot of wasted ink and paper from doing cleaning and testing repeatedly."
3,Decent cheap mp3 player with a few quirks.,"This mp3 player works fine, sound quality is adequate. One plus is that the USB plug is integrated into the machine (rather than using a cable, like many other similar products). So there's no cable to lose. On the other hand, this does make the device slightly larger than some comparable players. A minus (in my opinion) is that the earbuds are integrated into the lanyard, so if you want to replace the earbuds with something better, you either carry around 2 sets of earbuds or go without a lanyard."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Piece of junk. First one arrived and would not come on. Wrote Petco. Replacement arrived. Plugged in. Flickered, came on for about two minutes, went out, will not come back on. JUNK. Wrote Petco and asked for refund. Garbage. Will not buy a Zilla product at all ever or another product from Petco online again."
4,Just The Thing For An Intelligent 12-Year-Old,"I read this when I was a kid and it really impressed me: derring-do, occult thrills, a hot dame, and Adolf Hitler. I dipped into it again years later and discovered a fairly pedestrian thriller, but if you're young and looking for seemingly arcane and forbidden reading, this will fill the bill. I read several other Wheatleys and this was, for my teenage (well, pre-teen) money, the best. It spurred a life-long interest in the occult. Though I remain a skeptic, I love reading about the mountebanks and charlatans who populate its byways. ""They Used Dark Forces"" boasts a nasty magus clearly based on Aleister Crowley, who was a thousand times more interesting than his fictional counterpart here. Still and all, good fun for an undemanding (or naive) reader...."
3,Fairly interesting,"If this book were entitled ""They Didn't Actually Use Dark Forces But There Was A Lot Of Excitement, Courage And Interestingly-Applied Psychology"" it would be more accurate.Worth reading, but don't expect more than an above-average adventure yarn."
3,great drill,"this is great, i have a black and decker dr601 drill before and it struggles when drilling in concrete. this drill does the job very well. i am satisfied with drill and would recommend this others. i use this drill like twice weekly."
5,Looks Brand New,"The drill and case look brand new, not a scratch or mark on any part of it. The drill itself is a heavy duty looking tool, a little bigger than your standtard drill. I have not used it on any large projects yet, but it has worked great so far on what I have needed it for."
1,Never worked!,Never got it to work. Even downloaded latest vers. Tried on a different computer. No joy. In fact that's how I would describe this product...No JOY!
4,it's ok,"It deals with feedback and control like the book title says. A little dry in some areas and could use improving, but overall a good book."
3,Undergraduate Student in Electrical Engineering,"Why are there no solutions to the presented problems? Most all books I have used, in my 3 years of studying EE, have had the answers to the odd numbered problems. One example within a chapter is not enough for a student to be certain that other, more different, problems can be aproached and solved in the same manner.If a solutions guide is available, I am more than willing to purchase it. suckomj@yahoo.com"
3,Interesting contemporary music.,"As an affictionado of more traditional NA music I have mixed reviews on this one. It is a contemporary album from a Native American raised in Germany and the European influence shows. That isn't a bad thing, it lends a refreshing twist to the music. However the blending of ""nature sounds"" is, to my ears, poorly done. The bird and water sounds are so processed and bright that they intrude rather than include themselves in the mix. I find that a negative, hence the 3-star rating. In spite of those flaws there is a definite positive spirit in the music. Track 4 can easily bring you to your feet and make you want to enter the circle with dance. Other tracks are spirited, relaxing, and meditative in turn. It's a good mix and a decent album, but don't expect traditional here. I do hope Peter finds a better mix engineer for his next album.... Live in Peace, Walk in Beauty; Morningfeather"
4,well played,"Kim Kashkashian still has my vote for the best recording of the Gamba sonatas. This record is well played, and adds a lot to the catalog of viola recordings. It is however not a very moving performance. If I hadn't heard Kim Kashkashian's first I would have probably given this recording 5 stars."
1,I bought it for one song.,"Only one song, ""Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman"" is worth listening to. Wish now I'd bought the CD for the movie soundtrack rather than this album. A REAL disappointment."
2,Nowhere near as good as his previous work,I didn't enjoy this album. The songs lack the interest of his older ones. There no songs that really stand out. Definitely this is a an album to skip--stick with his better ones.
3,Not as good as Waking Up the Neighbours,This isn't as good as Waking Up the Neighbours but still has some really good songs you will want to own. 18 Til I Die and Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman are the two standouts. H Y E R L a W is a sensational Spanish sounding love song. Do to You is a great fast song. Star starts of like a movie soundtrack sound and is an all right slow song but not one you'll play over and over again. We're Gonna Win is a good one to play if you're trying to get pumped up for a sporting event. It's not a bad motivational song. I Think About You has a good drum beat and lyrics. It Ain't A Party if You Can't Come Round is pretty good too.(I Wanna Be) Your Underwear and The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You are pretty stupid but are original sounding songs not like others on other albums. The other songs on here are pretty much the same as others on other albums just with different lyrics.
5,Bryan you've done it again,"Great CD. Track number 5 is so beautiful. Whenever I hear it, it reminds me of Jack. I love Bryan Adams. Keep up the good work."
3,"a VERY different BA album, but still a good one.","This album BA tries with a more hip and commercial style. Half of the songs are ballads. Not rock ballads, but still some very nice relaxing songs. The rock songs are more funny- kind of- easy rock songs. A very different BA album, and alot more relaxing. But actually a very happy and nice album! Best cuts are ""let's make a night to remember"", ""it ain't a party if ya can't come 'round"", ""The Only Thing that looks good on Me is You"" & ""You're still Beautiful To Me"". Go buy it, but not if you're expecting an album like ""Into The Fire"", ""waking up The Neighbours"" or ""Reckless""."
1,"sorry, but...","As a die-hard Bryan Adams fan, I was very disappointed with this outing. Without the input of Jim Vallance and Bob Clearmountain (song writers and producers of ""reckless"", ""Cut's like a knife"", etc.), Adams song-writing has clearly gone down hill. Klunkers such as ""I want to be your underwear"" and ""Black Pearl"" are scrapings from the bottom of the barrel. ""Mutt"" Lange's finger-prints are all over this album, from the corn-ball lyrics to the hackned riffs and choruses. Mutt produced one of the greatest albums in rock history, Def Lep's Pyromania, but since has done nothing but trivialize the genre. I'm sorry, but this album lacks quality and substance. The production is good, though. The vocals and guitar work are clear and crisp, also a Lange trade mark. I look forward to an Adams album when he's reunited with Vallance and Clearmountain."
4,Should've Been Better...,"This was a good album, but as BA is my favorite singer, I hold him to high standards. This album wasn't quite up to them...It's fortunate for him that I've bought all of his albums from ""Waking Up The Neighbors"" onward. This album has some awesome tracks, ""I'll Always Be Right There,"" ""I Think About You,"" the seminal ""Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman,"" the cheeky and funny ""I Wanna Be (Your Underwear),"" as well as ""Let's Make A Night To Remember"" ""Star,"" and ""The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You."" I like ""We're Gonna Win"" as well, though it is not much like his other songs. In some of the worse tracks on this album, though, it seems like Bryan needs to grow up a little. I'm 18 myself, and I certainly don't want to be ""18 'Till I Die."" The title track, as well as the horrible song ""Black Pearl."" keep this album from getting 5 stars. Shame on you BA! You made a good album, but it should've been better..."
3,Sell Out?,"** and a half. adams goes for big on two hit singles, most of the other ""stuff"" is filler, adams souds like he writes a couple of hits and quits after that.Dissapointing"
2,You Can't Stay 18 Forever,"Bryan Adams was a huge pop star back in the late '80s and early '90s, but this is the album that ultimately derailed his career. Released in 1996, the album marked the birth of the newer, ""cooler"" Bryan Adams: the one with slicked back hair. The image overhaul unfortunately overshadowed the album, which had its fair share of hits. ""Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman"" was the big hit here, and deservedly so. However, the album has just as many misses as hits: ""We're Gonna Win"" is Adams' sad attempt to create something of a stadium staple. Also, song titles like ""The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You"" and ""(I Wanna Be) Your Underwear"" are just creepy from a guy who once told us that everything he did, he did it for us. And that's the main problem with this album: Adams was the ""nice guy"" of rock and roll for too long. His new image and slickly produced album just don't quite work. Buy his ""Best of Me"" collection, or ""Have You Ever..."" as a single, and leave it at that."
2,"Bryan, Time to grow up.","The titles give it away: ""18 Til I Die,"" ""The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You,"" ""Do To You,"" ""I Wanna Be Your Underwear."" This is a work of deliberate immaturity, not a valiant effort to recapture youthful exuberance. This is just a mistake for a performer who is capable of quality material. There are ""guilty pleasures"" from such obviously infantile lyrics but they do not hold up for more than any one song. Add in Adams' worst movie theme (""Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman"") and you have what is possibly Adams' worst CD."
3,Not bad but not as good as previous cd's,"Bryan explores new horizons, that's fine, but the result is not as good as we are use to with this artist. It is a good cd, there is few songs that I don't really like but I would say that I like 80% of the album and Bryan is still a very good signer and composer, good rocking songs, excellent ballads (Let's make a night to remember and Have you ever really loved a woman) and more..."
1,Shoddy knock off,"Even though this item is pretty, the construction is poor. It's tinny and really, really hard to set. It's got a trusted old U.S. name but it's a cheap Chinese knock off...so sad."
3,Roger,"This is a very pretty clock. It is gold in color, twin bells atop the clock, a good sound to the alarm, easy to read face, easy to carry handle, but the set time knob and the set alarm time knob are very stiff and hard to turn. Otherwise it fits right in with an antique look."
2,not what i expected,"if you are looking for sweets this is a great book. but if you are looking for vegetable side dishes or easy recipes (as claimed on Oprah show) they are almost non-existent.all recipes are involved and the order of recipes in the book is a bit confusing. one chapter titled ""food for love"" has an odd mixture of soups, veggies, cakes,... so you have to leaf through the book to find what you want."
5,Warm and Wonderful,"Though my family and I do not often buy cookbooks, we agreed that this one was a ""keeper."" Some interesting recipes that are ""doable,"" and good text."
3,joeth,This book is pretty cool I like it. I will probably buy another Art Smith book in the near future.
3,Not quite what I expected,"At first glance the book was great. It's a feel good book that carries a good message. However, I found that the recipes were not for everyday cooks. Many of the recipes called for special ingredients that are not available at regular grocery stores. The author does provide sources for mail order but doesn't offer alternate ingredients. I found the same to be true with the appliances and cookware the author says to use. Not everyone has a Kitchen-aid or cast iron skillets, again, no alternate methods were given."
3,Fun but aerobically lacking,this is a pretty interesting and fun workout. You work some muscles that you might not realize you own. In comibination with diet and other aerobics this can really give you some nice ab definition. However..This is not a real aerobic workout. It takes a while to get used to the moves and be able to feel as if you can do them. If you're rhythmically challenged... this will be a toughie. Dolpina is also very weird... but i found that entertaining.
1,Don't bother,"I did this workout just once and had no desire to try again. It was boring, hard to follow, and gave no cardio benefit to speak of. The instructor's feet are partially covered by her costume at times so you can't see what you are supposed to be doing. And when they say ""goddess workout"" that is what they mean - you get to hear about the instructor's religious views as they relate to bellydance."
5,Surprisingly great workout!,"I purchased the ""Goddess Workout"" for fun in adition to my traditional fitness videos. I wanted to have something different to keep me motivated. To my surprise, as well as being lots of fun, Dolphina's DVD is really a great total-body workout while at the same time being low-impact. I have a knee injury and had no problems with any of the workout. I would definately recommend this DVD to anyone at any level of fitness."
4,Nice workout,"I consider this to be my more relaxing workout. It is low impact, but massages muscles and helps my body feel great after a long day.The camera work in certain sections could have been better, thus I took off a star. However many of the sections do not require the full body to be shown due to the area of isolation. The section that could have used the most work was the Hips section, since you can barely see them for most of it.The sections that stand out as the best in my opinion are the warmup, head and arms, chest and shoulders, and the shimmy. After that the hip circles and undulations. The hips section is poorly filmed and there also seems to be an editing flaw.Once the workout has been done a few times, the workout does become more clear. I don't think this is a workout to form an opinion about after the first use."
3,Not the best Bellydance workout,"This is more of an instructional video. The camera shots annoyed me only when it focused on the instructor's face at inappropriate times that I wanted to see the movement performed! I can tell the instructor is experienced in this dance and compared to other Bellydance videos, she actually explained certain movements with precision. I loved seeing her many dancing costumes, she's beautiful to watch and I appreciated her telling us spiritual and historical background of bellydancing. I feel it's more of an entertaining video to watch than to workout to."
1,Is this supposed to be bellydance?,"She might have tried to make an introduction to bellydance, but she didn't succeed. I've been bellydancing for several years. I don't know much about american dancestyle, but I dought that you will learn how to bellydance from this DVD. It doesn't look anything like oriental bellydance."
4,Fun but not Necessarily Fitness,"To my surprise, this is the first workout video that I've ever tried that I actually had FUN doing. However, it really isn't much of a workout - I didn't even break a sweat. It's still good to mix in with your other workouts on days you want something less strenuous. Another good point is the music, you get caught up in it, and the moves come more easily, I think. Dolphina is lovely and a good motivator. Camera angles leave a little to be desired, though, as previous reviews have stated - but I found that I could still figure things out after a few times through the DVD."
3,Perfect for in-between class practicing,"I love the music, set, and costumes in this DVD. And I think this is a great workout - to those who are not getting a workout, you need to be working harder to perfect the moves!! Either that or you need to go on to advanced. The workout is challenging and full of good belly dancing moves for a beginner like myself.However, it does not take the place of a class with a live instructer to answer your questions and critique your form. Especially if you don't have a mirror to watch your form while you dance. I use this to practice when I'm not at my weekly class and find it far superior to other bellydance DVDs I have. It's worth it!The only reason I gave it three stars instead of 5 is because too many times the camera focuses on her chest and face instead of her hips and feet - where the action is!! She is very pretty, but that is not what I bought the DVD for! : )"
2,Entertaining but...,"...not an effective workout. I didn't even break a sweat. Additionally, it's hard to follow because the camera is always focused on her face. If you want a good bellydance workout I would recommend the Bellydance Fitness for Beginners series with Veena and Neena."
3,Not that good,"Dolphina's instruction is adequate but the filming is pathetic. Hello! Dancers need to see the moves they are supposed to be learning! Also, I've been taking Cabaret and Tribal style dance lessons for several years, and Dolphina's names for the moves are different from any I've heard anywhere. The costume changes were unnecessarily distracting. I wouldn't buy this again and would prefer to have my money back!"
1,Poor instructional video,"I have been taking belly dance classes from a local professional once a week for over a year and thought that I would use this tape to fill in the rest of the days during the week. A number of the moves she does are beginner moves, but she never gives the proper name for the movements nor does she break it down for someone who is beginning. I was familiar with the moves so followed along easily enough. The worse part of the tape is the camera work! Horrible! The producers are so focused on using numerous camera angles that they miss a LOT of the movements that she is trying to teach. The editing is so bad and choppy that it significantly disrupts the flow of a movement. The ""routine"" is laughable. Not only was it jerky, poorly filmed, poorly edited, it didn't make any use of the music that we are supposedly dancing to. Nice costumes and sets, but save your money and find a tape that will actually teach you something about proper technique and give you a workout."
1,The worst bellydancing instructional DVD around.,"This is absolutely the worst instructional bellydancing DVD I have come across yet - and I've been through about 20. The beautiful costumes and sets cannot camouflage the fact this DVD is more about her ego and less about bellydancing. However, if you're looking for laughs, be sure and stop here."
5,Dolphina Goddess Workout Bellydance,"I am 52 and have given birth to 6 sons, last ones being twins. I am so excited about this workout. And Dolphina is absolutely adorable and is an excellent teacher.I just ordered her Introduction to Bellydance for my daughter in law.I highly recommend it and am looking forward to mastering bellydancing with the Goddess Workout by Dolphina.Jill"
3,"Pretty good, but.....","This DVD is not for people who are just starting out in bellydance. Apparently the cameraman really likes her face and upper body, because the shots of her legwork are rare. I'd suggest getting Neena and Veena's Basic Moves or Discover Bellydance videos first because they show either their entire body or the specific area(s) used in the movements, and they break the movements down well.If you're already familiar with basic moves, this is a fun routine with good musical selections, but not the most vigorous workout. Also, don't expect to get the choreography at the end the first try. She does not break it down.....just expects you to follow along."
3,"It's OK, but not great.","As many others have said too much of the DVD is spent on Dolphina and specific areas of Dolphina such as her face or breast. The costumes are wonderful; she gives great history and is very motivational. However, not enough repetition is given with certain moves. Sometimes as she explained the moves the camera was on her face and never showed the move she was performing with her body parts. The camera should be panned out completely when she is demonstrating and move and then it can refocus on her face or what have you. The only reason I am able to follow about 75% of what Dolphina does is that I have taken a beginners class before. I think I am going to try a different belly dance set."
1,Face Time,"This is the WORST belly dance workout video I have ever purchased to date. I have been belly dancing for almost two years and wanted to improve on basic movements and possibly learn a few new moves.If you decide to purchase this video, you will spend more time looking at dolphina's face and questioning what you should be focusing on. Also, if you do not have any knowlegde of this dance, you may experience some shoulder and neck pain as I did. Lastly, the video is very choppy. Dolphina focuses on several body parts then changes into a different outfit before giving new instructions. I found this to be very distracting.Don't waste your money. There are much better video's out there that focus on bellydancing and not the faces of the instructor or their outfits."
2,Not for the first-timer,"I got this DVD as a gift because it was part of the collection of videos which include more advanced work. Having danced for several years, I have to warn the beginner that this DVD is not going to teach you the right moves or give you the bellydancing workout that you crave.I was suprised to see that it was directed by a female because the video certainly spends the majority of the time highlighting Dophina's bellydancing physique and changing costumes rather than focusing on the actual moves and how to do them. So, in essence, this quickly became a Dolphina performance tribute rather than a lesson on bellydance techniqes.If you know what you're doing, it's a simple refresher - once you get past the glamorous Dolphina aspects.However, all in all, I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner or a learned bellydancer."
1,Horrible!,"I guess the camera operator was a guy, because throughout the workout the camera is focused on her breasts leaving you clueless to what you're supposed to be doing. Your money would be better spent on another video. Although, it is good for a laugh because it's like having a playboy bunny talk to you about chakras and spirtual energy."
2,Not the greatest DVD,"I have to agree with some other reviews. Eventhough, Dolphina is very pleasant and not nearly as stiff as some other instructors, the DVD was poorly made. Apparently, the cameraman did not understand his job. When Doplphina is describing a move, quite often that is all you get, instead of the view of what you are expected to do. This could have been a much better starter DVD for beginners. Don't get this DVD, if you are just starting out. For somebody very new at this, I would recommend Jenna's Belly Dance basics and beyond. If you already have an understanding of the basic moves and just want some variety, maybe you will like this DVD. It stays very basic and is a practice routine. You are not very likely to break a sweat with this one."
2,Never felt like a goddess...,The one good thing I can say is that some of the video was actually quite relaxing. The goddess/spiritual aspect kind of threw me off. You never have her tell you want to do with your arms when you're moving your hips or your legs. Half the time I followed her and half the time I had my arms waving around not knowing where to put them. The camera angles are off as most of these other reviews mention and she does appear to be seducing the camera man.
2,NO INSTRUCTION - NO BELLYDANCE,"The camera man is preoccupied with either her navel or her smile in this video. You have glimpses to the feet and leg work required to do the hip work. This could have been a great video had the camera man done his job. Instead, you have footage of unhelpful information throughout this video. It was like the camera could not get far enough in the space it where it was filmed. The best part of this video is the warmup which was professional (why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star)."
2,Suffers from bad camera work,"The only real problem I had with this was that the camera work in certain places is positively awful, while in others it's quite silly. For most of the workout the camera is focused on her face and upper body even while the lower body is being worked. This is a particular problem in the ""hips"" section. It is possible to infer what you should be doing with your legs, but it's not always shown clearly. In other places, effects have been added which are unnecessary and actually made me laugh.You should also be prepared to hear a lot about The Goddess, since it is the goddess workout. Moves are often explained by the way they relate to the chakras or Dolphina refers to their healing powers.The sets are lovely to look at and the music is enjoyable. It is possible to get past the shoddy camera work and follow the video, but it's not always easy."
1,How can you learn to dance if you can't see the teacher?,Most of the time the camera is focussed on Dolpina's face. Thismakes it impossible to see what her hips and feet are doing. Howcan you learn hip movements by looking at the teacher's eyes? You can't. Dolphina is also a poor dancer. She is usually off the rhythm of the music playing in the background and her technique is stiff. The cluttered backgrounds that she uses are distracting. I am an advanced dancer and I frequently couldn't understand what she was trying to demonstrate. One of my beginning students was completely lost. Save your money for a better video.
3,Lacking in many places,"If you have no prior experience to belly dance, I really don't recommend this Dvd/Video. If you do have previous experience in middle eastern dance and want a fun, new workout to do at home, this would be a good buy for you.The theme of this video seems to be Dolphina's beauty rather than her dance skill. She lacks rhythm and makes her routinues hard to follow. Her worshiop of the goddess is appreciated here, but in a part of the workout she states to perform a move with the feeling, ""you know you want me, but you can't have me"", which is a representation of belly dancers that we are trying to get away from. There are other more inspiring teachers/videos to first learn from such as Rania and Veena and Neena."
3,Good introduction...,"but nothing more. I would recommend it if you are interested in the history of swing (particularly the music) and want a guide to swing musicians. Do not expect to learn to swing dance from this book. The lindy hop chapter is like like a glossary of swing dance terms.Overall, it is well written and and provides a good introduction but it is too general and its focus can be too brief at times. It doesn't contain anything you couldn't learn from going to a swing dance or using a search engine."
4,Good for beginners to intermediates.,It is light in weight and has great power but lacks control once you move towards advanced play. If feels good in hands and really easy to move around. Large head size and wider frame help generating great power.
1,Too much power,"I didn't like this racquet at all. Too much power. Any small amount of force you use, goes out of bounds. I was trying to modify my swing style and holding the racket not to the edge, but somewhere in the middle to hit with less force, but still couldn't get it to work for me."
2,"the racquet came with head original strings, never restrung","seller promised restrung racquet. However, it came with the original string. Went to Dick's sport and compared with the orignal string. There is no difference. The string snapped after 3 weeks. Unfortunately, it is high school tennis season so cannot return it. Have it restrung at a local store. Kept the original string and planning to go through Amazon to issue a complaint."
3,Too much string tension,"This is the same racquet I currently use and have been using for the past 3 years. My tennis coach noticed the excessive vibration and doesn't think it's entirely due to the way it's strung. Much different from my older version. It still handles well but I'm not entirely comfortable with it. I'll just save the new one as a spare instead of the other way around. Also, though I ordered both racquets online, the first one came with a bag but this one did not."
3,Good racquet for beginners only,"I have had this racquet for about 2 years now. I started playing tennis 3 years ago and wanted to improve my game. This racquet turned out good in that respect. It helped me learn the strokes, serves etc. But thats where the usefulness of this racquet ends. The fact that this racquet is very light and head heavy, is a problem. There is not much momentum going into the shot with this racquet. Yeah, one could argue that with a faster swing, more momentum can be generated to produce violent shots. But I have found it very difficult to control my shots on faster swings. The ball would tend to hit the racquet off center very often. This racquet is extremely difficult to control with faster/topspin incoming balls. And for the volleys at the net, unless you are holding the racquet with both hands, it would be hard to even return the ball. Lately, I am having a wrist pain with this racquet. I would not recommend this racquet to anyone other than a beginner."
4,Head TiS6 strung racquest,"I had to have the recquest restrung to get tight enough strings, but I have never purchased one strung that I did not have to restring. A good overall lightweight balanced racquet, I can get power and control with it."
3,Broke frame on second time playing,Bought this racket from sports authority and the frame cracked on the second time I played with it. I didn't even do anything that would strain it. For the time I was able to use it...it generates a lot of power on its own. I had to adjust my gripping to accommodate for the natural power of the racket. Once I figured it out I began to like the racket. I would recommend insurance if the seller offers it.
4,It holds well,"I really like this racquet. Had demoed several others without success before an expert recommended this one to me. He was right. I have no complaints! Its light, it's powerful. It holds well. NO vibrations. The price was right. Now, I just have to work on my strokes..."
4,Head Ti.S6 Tennis Racquet,Pretty good racquet at such a low price especially for beginners up to near intermediate. Only problem is you need to time it hard at balls that are coming fast at you. If not the shock will get to your wrist. Overall I rate it as a good buy but definitely not for players who are already at the intermediate stage looking for advance racquets.
5,Great Racket,"Still getting used to this racket, I've been overhitting b/c I got so used to it with my crummier entry level racket. When you hit the sweet spot on this guy, the ball has some great zing to it, and the spin it puts on the ball is great. I'm still not that great so I can't provide a really in depth review, but I'd recommend it."
4,I love this racket and can't believe the price. Can't beat it.,"This racket is terrific. It was recommended by my sister because my arm was bothering me with my old racket. This racket is very light and powerful.My arm feels much better, my game has improved and the price on amazon is phenomenal. It is a great price for such a high quality racket. I highly recomment it.So much so - this is my first time writing a review and I have been buying from amazon for years."
3,Actually not a bad movie!,"If your a fan of the legendary godzilla films or giant monster films I reccommend this to you. When Danish mining engineers discover the tail of a huge prehistoric monster deep in the arctic ice, they ship it to Copenhagen for research. There, Professor Martens keeps the tail frozen in a large refrigerated room. But someone leaves the door open, and the tail starts to thaw... and grow! In time, it spawns an entire monster, kills a lab assistant and escapes. Reptilicus soon terrorizes Copenhagen in a grisly rampage. General Grayson and the army hunt down only to discover that their explosives will creat hundreds of new creatures! Terror and suspense build to a spine-tingling climax in this vintage sci-fi classic...one of the most exciting horror films of all time. Those were not my word but the description given from the movie itself. Maybe not the greatest , not even close , but a fun to watch!"
3,Hey....what did you expect.....still good for what it is,"If you have done your research , you know that this movie 's soundtrack was redoneand there was lots of other problems...but its still a monster movie and when isaw it at the theater many moon ago i did enjoy it as a kid. Now a big Kid i am,im still enjoying it for what it is.Classic movies will last forever."
4,Good Old Fashioned Creature Feature,"Great old fashioned creature feature about a monster that grows from a fossil and wrecks havoc in Copenhagen Denmark. Sure the effects are not very good, but this film has a special place in my heart as I saw it as a child and loved it. That magic hasn't gone away. Print quality is very good, and this DVD brings back the memories."
3,"Great Story, horrible effects, but a classic monster movie!","Reptilicus is a great story that happened on film too soon. Its makers didn't have the Jurassic Park effects available today, and obviously didn't have the budget to make a decent film. But the story is a good one, it's believeable, and is always a good relief from the cheesy Japanese movies that are out there. It's filmed in Denmark and the actors speak English. If you want some great 60's sci-fi without rubber-suited Japanese monsters, horrible dubbing, and stupid story lines, try this one. It's bad, like all monster movies, but it's good fun."
1,Easily the worst giant monster movie of all time,"People think Godzilla movies have bad special effects? Well, after seeing this piece of cinematic waste, maybe people will respect the workmanship put into the G films. This movie is absolutely terrible. The special effects, like I said, are extremely egregiously bad. All of the live action scenes are nauseatingly ridiculous. It just has no redeeming values whatsoever. It's not a ""good bad movie"" just bad in the most extreme way. Why can't MGM release some other monster movie on DVD? Why not release The Mysterians instead? Oy."
1,Not Good at all,"This is one of the worst kajiu film I watch.Sorry But its hardto be on the level on godzilla at this time.Reptilicus to me is a cheap version of Manda (Destroy all monster).The story line is stupid and Its just plain cheesy.Please don't waste your money owning this flick, my as well go play sports,read or book or something then to watch this!!!"
3,Cheese Danish!,"I didn't even know that Denmark had a film industry! If you like cheesy sci-fi films (and I do, especially when I am on summer vacation), this will be right up your alley. The fact that almost everyone in it looks Nordic and speaks with a heavy Danish accent and that you get a mini-travelogue of Copenhagen in the middle of the movie, only adds to its uniqueness. The Danish janitor does a scandinavian equivalent of stepin fetchit, complete with bug eyes. There are actually a few impressive scenes, such as thousands of Danes running throught the streets from the monster. As movies go, it stinks. As bad movies go, it is fun. Check it out."
3,I saw it on the big screen when I was 10 . . .,"The 3 stars is for sentimental reasons. It scared the daylights out of me when I was a kid. Yes, it was in the day when you could ride your bicycle on a 10 mile ride as a 10 year old with your mother not knowing about it, end up at the State theater in the middle of the city and see a matinee for four bits. When done with the 10 cent Dots, 25 cent soda and popcorn, you and your buds could speculate about the mysterious and terifying ending for hours on end. Even though it is a horrible movie by today's standards, it was on the big screen and as I recall the theater was full. It was a great way to spend a summer afternoon in air conditioned splender. Sure this would be a good candidate for Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it still is one of those Movies that reminds one about a purer and simpler time and famous freinds no longer seen. ""EEEEH! REPTILICUS!"""
5,"Uffda, Pass the Aalborg please!","All I can say is that this is without a doubt the finest ""thawed out, prehistoric monster on the loose"" movie ever made in Denmark.If they could have kept him frozen like a bottle of aquavit things would have been just fine but NOOOO...Until they re-master ""From Hell It Came"" this will have to do as my all time worst monster movie.In other words, I love every nasty frame."
3,Now if they'll just reprint the novelization,"Once upon a time Reptilicus , Gorgo , and Konga had paperback novelizations.In the case of Reptilicus the book was better.Although the film's plot isn't that different , the realization of the monster was much better left to one's imagination than what appears on the screen.This is the one Tri-Star should have remade.They could have even blown Reptilicus up and had 100's of small one regenerate in the Garden."
1,A Sublime Stinker,"This classic piece of junk has withstood the test of time to reign as #1 in the ""so bad it's great"" category. The premise is totally ridiculous, the locations are mind-numbingly dull and colorless, the acting is stinkeroo all the way, and the monster is a hernia-inducing sock puppet that terrorizes....Copenhagen.A must see for all true afficionados of cinematic garbage. I rate the MOVIE a 1, but the whole experience rates a 10."
4,Beautiful CD - Spiritually uplifting!,"I purchased this CD as a gift and it's recipient is very happy with my choice. I did listen to this with her and although the songs and music themselves are great, I feel it lacks professional recording. The quality of sound that should be there, is missing making it a little inferior to those CDs recorded with equipment superior to what was used in this recording studio."
4,A little above average,"Condidering most of the CYOA type books are over after about 10 paragraphs, this is pretty good. I ALMOST got through the first time, but made a minor goof. So, not really a challenge, but it's interesting (and ususally funny) to go back and look what would have happend if you made some silly or less than optimal solutions. BTW, look out, some questions ask you if you have or if you found something. I missread the first one, thinking it said something like, 'if you would like to use the key'. Which lead me to believe that the key was in the room there."
1,Rip Off,"I bought this and when I received it there were no CDs. I had a replacement sent and that had no CDs. Don't waste your money for this edition, it's a total rip off. Save your money and buy the standard edition instead. This sucks."
2,Superior audio with inferior setlist,"The 5.1 mix on this DVD is a vast improvement over the Rush in Rio disc. But, true Rush fans will be extremely disappointed to find this performance heavily edited. The most memorable moments from the concert, YYZ, Red Sector A, La Villa Strangiato and By-Tor and the Snowdog, are left on the ""cutting room floor."""
2,"older, not better","This DVD certainly doesn't live up to Rush's standards. They are older and showing it. The perormance is lacluster at best and the audio quality is sadly lacking also. For me, the 'Moving Pictures' concert is still the best as far as performance and song selection. All the extras in the R30 set are peripheral at best. I'd rather have one quality DVD without all the add ons."
2,Incomplete,"There are so many songs missing from this set. The tour R30 had a total of 33 songs that were apparently played throughout the tour but for some reason that I can't understand Rush only decided to perform only 22 songs for there DVD release. Some of the tracks that are missings are Red Sector A, One Little Victory & others. Do yourself a favor and try to find either a bootleg recording of a show on this tour or save your money & buy something else."
2,"FRUSTRATED THAT ONLY HAS BLU RAY SHOW, AND JUST HAVE NO EXTRA INSERT","FRUSTRATED KNOWING THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT THIS BLU RAY Definitive lack the footgear and clips [bootleg] WHAT'S IN THE ISSUE OF ANY R30 DVD, SIMPLE [2 DVDS] OR DELUXE EDITION [2 DVDS AND CDS 2] Ask a question COMPREHENSIVE ABOUT THIS, THE PAGE OF OWN REPORT THAT RUSH iS ON IT WITH ALL THAT IS IN THE DVD THAT SHAME, THE PICTURE IS BEAUTIFUL, BUT IT IS NOT A Definitive EDITION, ONLY COMES THE SHOW AND NOTHING MORE, AND WHAT NOT INSERT CONSTA THERE, THERE IS A LOT OF LIES THAT PUTS THE MANUFACTURER AND THERE ... I BOUGHT IN MY AMAZON HERE, AND IF YOU KNEW WHAT WAS THE BLU RAY WITH NOTHING, ONLY THE SHOW, buy only the DVD, Ta equal to JOKE OF BLU RAY JIMI HENDRIX LIVE AT WOODSTOCK, EVERY DAY LAUNCH ANOTHER ISSUE WITH EXTRAS, 3 ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH TO EXPLORE ISSUES ... .. ALREADY .. IT BECAME Slots dipped itself in the documentaries that WERE ALREADY IN THE WOODSTOCK BLU RAY THAT'S LEFT ALMOST 1 YEAR ......"
5,What else is there to say but......UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!,"The music rocks! The video rocks! THE BAND ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RUSH has been my favorite band since the mid-80's and they will never lose that #1 status with me! I own several of their LPs as well as more than 20 of their CDs!!!! I have seen them in concert twice (first time row nine, second time FRONT ROW!) and plan on seeing them again on their next tour. RUSH ROCKS 4-EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Rush R30 DVD,Thanks Rush for another chance to to see the Fanatastic R30 show . I saw 4 UK shows on this tour and it was jaw dropping. Forget about the 8 dropped songs and enjoy the 22 we are lucky enough to get. (And the extra bonus stuff !!)
4,"Good Concert, Great Extras","The concert on this DVD is an excellent collection of songs, although there are a few glaring ommissions as others have pointed out. I actually find it hard to make it through the whole concert in one sitting, partly because it is long, and partly because it isn't quite good enough to take me to that zone where I lose the ability to leave the room (the very best concerts do).Where this set shines is the extras. There are excellent clips of performances and TV appearances throughout their career. I'll probably end up watching their amazing performances from back in the 70s as often as I'll watch the main concert.This set doesn't quite reach the 5 star mark, but it comes close. Highly recommended."
4,rush r 30,"excellent concert dvd, wish i could have gotten it in hd but it is still well worth watching again and again"
4,"""Rush"", dont Run. Steady as she goes.","Rush is amazing. I have to admit, I have only seen them once, but amazing. This video captures much of the magic without ANY hype whatso ever. I think this was the intention. The interviews are great, candid. When someone says ""live by example"", I say Rush would be the epitome of this concept as a rock band.Thanks for all the great material fellas and keep it coming.PS. I gave this DVD 5 Stars, but for some reason it came our four. FIVE stars is what is should have. Its worthy of it."
5,Perfect Selection,"I love the song selection. Of course as with any die hard Rush fan, there are always songs that I wish were added to the set list. From what I saw online the boys only eliminated songs that were already released on Rush in Rio (RIR). I was expecting basically the same set list and thought it was too soon for a follow-up to RIR. I was expecting to be disappointed. There are 13 songs, including the Overture and Der trommler, that are not on RIR. I hope the sound has a little less crowd noise than RIR, even though those fans ROCK. Finally, you throw in the rarities! Rush never fails to amaze!Anatomy of a drum solo soon to follow. This should satisfy my need for new Rush material until the next studio album."
1,Very Weak,"If you love Rush as I do, spare yourself. I have to think the band must be at least a little embarassed by this product. The performance comes off as very formulaic and flat and posseses none of the soul and electricity of Rio.Also, this '60s tribute material is painful."
1,Rush Drops the Ball With This One,"How does the greatest band in the world celebrate their 30th anniversary? By giving us a DVD with (count 'em) EIGHT songs missing from the set. Never know to be in touch with the cult following of die-hard fans that they have, Rush has disappointed many times when it comes to past concert releases,although, given the nature of VHS and it's time constraints, it was acceptable, this isn't. This Rush release is sure to leave many-a-fan disenchanted. Go for Rush in Rio and take a ""Pass"" on this one. I'm sure they'll double dip and release a ""special edtion"" HD-DVD version in the future with the missing songs to milk the fans some more."
4,Rush Power Trio,"1.Sound- great but could have been DTS2.Image-Very, very good3. Venue - Great because not too big , not too small, therefore the sound is great4. The medley at the begining is amazing and the second one with XanaduCompared with RIO, In Germany the sound and image are betterbut the huge crowd in RIO is awesome, depends what you are looking for.Both are great."
3,"RUSH ROCKS, but ...","Hello RUSH fans! I'll be seeing RUSH in concert on Sept. 8th 2007! For the 25th time, in Chicago! So... every one knows they are my 'fave' band! This is a good DVD. But the camera work needs to be on each player for more then 20 seconds! So we can all get a good view of how they each... play righteoualy, ""wink""! RUSH should have been in the ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"" (USA).. awhile ago!! Bummer, they're not...(yet). Overall. It is a good DVD, buy it! Be safe and good!"
5,RUSH is amazing!,"I am one of the fortunate people who actually got a hold of an advanced copy of the RUSH-R30 and let me tell you, RUSH fans will not be disappointed at all (as if we really would be right? I mean, come on, its RUSH!). The concert footage and the interviews and music they've done over the years, all of it is great, especially the audio and visual quality of the footage being shot in high-definition. The DVD also comes with two limited edition Rush guitar picks (which is perfect because I play the guitar as well and gives me more motivation to continue growing my passion and talent) and a souvenir backstage pass. It is the ultimate 30th anniversary package to celebrate the bands success with. They allow us to be a part of everything that took place with a click of a button and souvenirs to keep, as though you were actually there. NOVEMBER 22nd! Don't forget :-)"
5,Haven't seen it all but I know it's all terrific,"The concert footage is amazing (what's with the washer and dryer?) and the interviews are fun to watch as well, except for the last one with only Geddy and Alex and we all know why - Neil doesn't want to be asked about the loss of his daughter and wife in the late 1990s. Can't blame him.I have seen them 4 times, each in a different state, and all were wonderful shows.September 1982: Des Moines, IowaSummer 1990: Omaha, NebraskaApril 1994: Kansas City, Missouri (just happened to be in town that day!)Same week, April 1994: Moline, Illinois - 4th row, center stage.Keep on rocking for 30 more years, guys!"
3,R30 No CD's,The DVD's are great but the CD's were missing! Not cool since that was the reason I bought the deluxe edition. Rip Off.
1,Never Got the chance! Missing CDs on 2 attempted deliveries!,"Sorry, I never got the chance to play this DVD/CD package as the CDs were missing.On two deliveries, both were missing the CDs.... After 2 attempts, a refund was issued.The main reason I purchased this particular item was all about the CDs (to play on my stereo system)...did not care of the DVDs."
2,Disappointed,"Instrumentally they pretty much still have it, but Geddy has lost his voice. I also don't think the audio is as great as some claim."
4,Awesome concert,Awesome concert! I received this video in pristine conditions.Thanks Amazon.On this video you can see Rush celebrating 30 years of great music.They play the best of their best.They also performed the 2112 album and some classic rocks like the seeker among others.Fantastic concert from start to finish.A MUST! for Rush fans and for people who want to know the band's music.
3,Gread DVDs...but where are the CDs?,"First of all, what everyone else said: the performance here is great (despite Neil Peart's misgivings he expresses in the book Roadshows about this specific concert). Too, the 2nd DVD is a wonderful treasure.All that being said, my affinity for this package is tempered by my experience with Amazon (but maybe it's the supplier's fault, not Amazon's). I've ordered it now three times...and I have ensured I ordered the Deluxe version, advertised as a 4-disc package (2 DVDs and 2 CDs).However, each time there have been no CDs. There's a cutout on the right side of the package for an insert for the CDs, but alas, no CDs. Again, this is three times I've received packages from Amazon that do not have the CDs.Sadly, this experience knocked my stars rating down."
3,Stellar stereo mix......and that's about it.,"The stereo mix is a VAST improvement over the ""Rush In Rio"" DVD, although I hope fans will remember that the set-up time for the recording gear for ""Rush In Rio"" was desperately brief and the show was lucky to have gone off at all. It was all they could do just to put on the show.""RUSH 30"" sounds great! But the show itself is lacking the energy, spontaneity, and fun of the ""RiR"" show. The bonus features are interesting and merit the purchase if you are a Rush fan.I was a little disappointed with Neil's drum solo. It lacked the spark of his ""RiR"" piece. But that is just one man's opinion."
4,Del Putas!!!,"El show empieza con animaciones de todas las portadas de sus albums Y rompe la ansiedad con su Overtura R-30 y a la mitad del concierto una mini-pelicula de Alex, Geedy y Peart como muñecos peleando contra un dragón... y lo que viene después TIENES QUE VERLO!!!!, no solo es un simple concierto, es un DVD que vale la pena, y por si fuera poco dos CDs adicionales de audio, un parche, dos vitelas firmadas por Alex y Geedy en un excelente empaque ...A Must Have!"
4,RUSH R30 MUCH BETTER THAN RIO,THE SOUND AND VIDEO ARE 10 TIMES BETTER THAN RUSH IN RIO THE BONUS DISC MATERIAL IS GREAT AND THE AUDIO CD'S ARE ALSO 100 TIMES BETTER THAN RIO WHICH ARE UNLISTENABLE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BLOW YOUR SPEAKERS. THERE ARE A FEW MINOR GLITCHES ON THE DVD BUT NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE OVERLOOKED. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE MISSING 8 SONG'S THAT THE BAND DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE. HOWEVER I FOUND A BOOTLEG FROM THE NYC USA R30 SHOW THAT HAS THE MISSING 8 SONG'S AND THE AUDIO AND VIDEO IS OF EQUAL QUALITY AS THE BAND'S RELEASE. NEXT TIME PLEASE RELEASE THE FULL SHOW I BELIEVE IN THIS CASE YOU DID OWE IT TO YOUR FAN'S AFTER THAT HORRIBLE MISTAKE RLEASING RIO WHAT A MISTAKE IN LIVE RECORDING .
2,Could Be Better,"I bought this DVD awhile back and was a little disappointed - the concert was mostly very dark and you really could not see much. In addition Geddy Lee's voice is now in poor shape, his vocals are nowhere near the qaulity of the original recordings on the albums. However there is alot of material here aside from the conceet to dwell on, for a true Rush fan this set is a must, but don't overexpect."
4,Slowly but surely,"Another great DVD from Rush, but it doesnt always seem that way. The Live in Rio DVD sounded great, but why didnt they release the show from Different stages instead. To me, that sounded much better and you had much less crowd noise interfering with the music. Also, why can't they release ""Through th Camera Eye"" and ""Grace Under Pressure"" DVD's as well? It seems Rush gives us things only in segments. Anyway, I will always be Rush fan and of course I did purchase R30 mainly for the vintage cuts on the bonus DVD."
5,R30 is great,"what an awesome package. 2 dvd's, double cd, guitar pics and more.I opened this package with joy and really enjoyed the contents.Listening and watching disk 1 for someone who never has seen Rush in person was fantastic.Disk 2 was interesting but felt short. I wish they had found more video to put on this disk, however the Hall of Fame clip was just out of this world.A great buy for any Rush fan"
2,"Pretty, but very uncomfortable","The product look fantastic, but after trying it out I was more sore then ever. My quest for a comfy female seat continues :("
1,Not the quality I was expecting,I purchased these sanding discs hoping to get a good quality product and I was so disappointed. The discs are super thin and wore out very quickly. The Diablo pads I used in the past will sand circles around the Mirkas. I will never buy these again.
5,GREAT,"If you have ever heard Gayle in person, he is like a Christian Robin Williams. neither His audio or book version d brings out his true preaching style but it is both insightful,and at times humourous..especially the electric chair...you'll see what I mean. BUT Gayle also brings out those things we always knew but never realized that we KNEW them!!He brings out simple, but overlooked VITALLY IMPORTANT truths about Jesus. He brings to light just how Jesus did things and how WE should.His manner is easy to understand and down to earth.A great guy and a great book"
4,Very relaxing music from a real talented musician,"A very fine piece of work, specially when you realize that this album was recorded in only one take.In my opinion some backing tracks would benefit the whole opus, like some soft drumming or perhaps other additional voices, but it's just a matter of personal taste. Anyway I like this CD a lot and I think is really worth of a listening for several uncommon reasons: it's a true solo performance, an electric violin album is a rare collectable item and last but not least the music is real good."
3,I liked it.,"I liked this CD very much, but I didn't LOVE it. I think it's because I play the violin though...because I prefer the regular acoustic sound over the electric violin sound. Other than that...he's an awesome musician of course!"
1,Too salty,The almonds in this mix were great - crunchy with a bit of lemon flavor; but the olives were too salty to consume.
2,BEWARE! only includes half of the movie alexander directors cut,"picked this up as it was cheap but i guess not so good a deal as i thought...o.k for heaven & earth , any given sunday , and natural born killers but alexander directors cut only includes HALF THE MOVIE ! INCREDIBLE ! this is indicated NOWHERE on the packaging. DISC 2 material NOT included"
1,You've GOT to be kidding me!,"I just finished watching 2 HOURS of Alexander, get to the end of the disc and see it's PART ONE Only?!?! Part 2 is NOT included? You get just HALF of the movie? The movie wasn't even that good, but watching it until it ends at some random point was frustrating.Don't buy this DVD pack for any reason, giving money to Warner Brothers for this crap is criminal."
2,Alexander Disc 2 NOT Included,"As others have indicated, Disc 2 is missing, and I want a refund! Not that I really want to see the 2nd half of Alexander, but this is false advertising."
5,dark comedy,great movie lots of great actors awsome cinematography and writing. I dont know how this movie is not more popular.
2,"Interesting, but not really a point","The movie was sort of interesting, but it didn't seem to have a point. I also didn't like the constant killings, even though they weren't actually shown. I wouldn't call it horrible, but I don't see a reason why anyone would want to see it. I don't even know why anyone bothered to make the movie."
5,oak,I have owned this product before and it has worked quite well for sanding curved surfaces or corners and edges. compact and fits well.
3,Misleading???,"To the person below who mentioned how this product is misleading...since when did the infamous show ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" deserve a rating of R, when after all it was originally aired on the friendly, kid targeting network, Nickelodeon???"
5,Great EX Set,"This is one of my favorite Weapon EX Sets. It's a neutral color so it works on many shinkis, not just the blank ones.""The figure has a cute face with cute packs with giant freakin' guns. The most obvious weapon is her giant Gatling Gun.The figure comes with a cute head that features pigtails, 2 position visors and a breathing apparatus. The body additions include various packs and armor. A backpack is included that can store several different accessories and has Rabbit-like ""ears"" that you can position freely.Waffebunny is no slouch when it comes to armament - Included with the figure are 2 pistols, 2 machetes and a large Gatling gun. The gun features a removable armor clip and a stand.""It's a great set if you're looking for some extra parts to load up your favorite Shinki."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this for my daughter. I was happy and excited, but that feeling changed suddenly when we tried to play the fourth movie called the Majestic. It did not load like the other movies. Apparently, that movie was blank and never loaded on the cd. I am as my daughter extremely disappointed. My confidence is shappetefd. I am angry. I am not sure i could shop on Amazon again. This of course can change if the seller can see me a copy of Jim Carey's the Majestic movie. I want this resolved."
3,Great movies. Less than standard dvd case.,"The movies themselves are fantastic. They are definitely great choices to show case Jim Carrey's talent for acting. When purchasing this collection I had assumed that the four discs would be displayed separately within the one case. Turns out, they are piled on top of one another which makes getting the movie disc at the bottom of the stack a slight annoyance."
3,It's Jim Carrey,"3 our of 4 ain't bad. I purchased this DVD set & I mostly watch ""Yes Man"", ""The Mask"" & my favorite ""Dumb & Dumber"" and I haven't really watch ""The Majestic"". I always enjoy most of Jim Carrey's movies."
5,On a spiritual high!,"Father Stan is sooooo awesome! Just last summer i was in St. Louis for the Franciscan University of Steubenville youth conference and he performed ""Do you love me"" and spoke to the youth. his message comes across so clear and powerful it makes you want to cry for joy at the works of our Lord. I've seen him quite a few times now and he comes here (to Bermuda) quite often. His music is just awesome....especially the reggae in ""Do you love me?"" Buy it!!!!!"
1,Different grit received from what I ordered,"I ordered 60 grit sanding belts, but received 80 grit sanding belts. The outside of the box in which the five belts were packaged said 80Y on one end and 60Y on the other end. First time I have received an incorrect item after ordering through Amazon after many, many years. Will keep the 80 grit sanding belts as I can use them. Just won't be as fast as the 60 grit. Will not order again because I don't need another box of 80 grit sanding belts and wouldn't trust them to get it correct this time as the box is not labeled correctly."
2,good quality belts with poor quality tape/glue,"Out of the box of 5 belts, 2 had failed within a few minutes of use (tape holding the belt together came apart) Contacting 3M resulted in a fast reply but they just passed the buck to Amazon.comAmazon.com did nothing to help me other than to waste my time discussing the problem on the phone. I will never buy 3M sanding belts in the future as I need quality/reliable sanding belts"
3,35 more Cards to Capture in 1 Volume? Doubt it...,"In this volume of Cardcaptor Sakura, Sakura meets an old man whose lost his Grand daughter on her holiday with her father, Toya and Yukito and spends some time with him. Next is the school play where Sakura is playing the Prince to Li's the Princess in their schools version of Sleeping Beauty in the talent show.Sakura only captures 2 cards, Light and Dark. And they mostly give themselves up anyway. This volume was a tad disappointing considering it's suppose to be about capturing cards. Li is supposed to be her rival and he hasn't caught any!And where is Meilin? She hasn't even arrived, and I begin to doubt she ever will.Most of this volume was dedicated to ""who is Yue"" and yeh. Knowing who he really is, isn't that much of exictment for me.This volume was a tad disappointing, but still overall a must get."
5,Roar of Love ROCKS!,"I guess I'm a little bit skewed on this because I had this album on vinyl when I was a kid, but it truly is one of my favorite recordings. I love the tight harmonies and the wonderful storytelling. FANTASTIC!"
5,Excellente!!!,I absolutely LOVE this CD! I recommend it to anyone who has seen the Chronicles of Narnia... it's like the story in song. It arrived in excellent shape and on time.
4,Great Music - but Short One Cut.,"The displeasure is with Amazon, not with the music.2nd Chapters of Acts always has great music, however the Amazon Version has only 13 cuts while the original album has 14 cuts. The missing cut is ""Gifts From Father Christmas"".I did not discover this until after purchasing the album on Amazon. There were no notices that stated there would be less cuts than the original. Buyer BEWARE - Read over the cut list, comparing with the original CD list of cuts, before buying."
2,"Good CD, but missing a track!","Interesting CD from my childhood, but one of the tracks is missing! Track 7, Gifts From Father Christmas, is listed, lyrics and all, but is not actually on the CD. If you're looking for the complete album, you'll have to look elsewhere."
5,Great in 1978. Still magical in 2005.,"I received my ""Roar of Love"" CD in the mail today and it is playing right now! This is the soundtrack of Narnia and my youth. It is all here: the Lamp post, the Witch in her sleigh, the Stone Table and the Lion who is a lamb. If you know and love ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" you will hear it come to life in these songs from 2nd Chapter of Acts.The ""Gifts From Father Christmas,"" although listed as track 7 is actually at the end of track 6 and is one of my favorites. But for me ""I've Heard the Stars Sing Before"" is the best; a very ""2nd Chapter of Acts"" sound without being as 1970's as the ""Witch's Demise."" The stars singing also harkens the image of the creation of Narnia from ""The Magician's Nephew.""I loved this ablum as a kid and now I can enjoy it as a ""grown-up"" without the skip in the ""White Stag"" song like my LP had! I can't wait to share the music with my young son when we start reading the Chronicles of Narnia together."
5,This is sooo cool!!!,"My husband has wanted to get a video projector for a while, but just never took the plunge. (...). I convinced him to get this for himself for a late Christmas present.We brought it home and hooked it up easily. My family is watching ""LOTR - The Two Towers"" right now. We can not believe how cool this is.I am so glad that we bought this. This video projector is neat because it is lightweight and portable. We can use it in any room. We are not limited by screen size, only by the size of the wall. So far our picture is 70"", but as soon as my kids move a couple of books shelves (ha ha) we will expand to 150""."
2,Party downer,"This is a cheapo cheapo compliation of a few hits and some nicely obscure trys by solid street corner songsters.Ya got "" Gee"" Crows w/the original ack wrong vocal, the Cleftones ""Little Girl of Mine"", Wrens Valentines, and the sublime,""Sunday Kinda Love"" Harptones.The cover if the CD is better than the inside..."
4,Horror with comedy,"saw this for the first time recently and recommend it strongly. Vincent Price stars as Edward Lionheart a famous Shakespearean actor who is snubbed at the annual critics awards. In a fit of depression he kills himself or does he? The critics then start mysteriously dying in horrible ways.This is well done with a strong black comedy element that works well. In fact if the film hadn't had the comedy element it wouldn't have been anywhere near as good. Theres a classic laugh out loud line for Eric Sykes near the end which he delivers off camera - very funny.The cast is superb collection of mainly British actors, as well as Vincent Price you get: Ian Hendry, Eric Sykes, Arthur Lowe, Dennis Price, Diana Rigg and Michael Horden and a little cameo role from Diana Dors.Well worth getting at the right price."
5,Theater Of Blood,"Edward Lionheart (Vincent Price) a demeted Shakespearean actor, adds murder when he takes gruesome revenge on the eight critics who didn't give him an award for acting. So now he's going to make them pay. He fakes to commit suicide so they all belive he's dead. One by one he kills them based on Shakespearean plays. His daughter (Diana Rigg) helps him in his plan. Theater Of Blood has lots of graphic violence but its fun to watch. Watch for Ms. Moon ( Vincent Price's wife) as he electrocutes her in the play Joan of Arc. Theater Of Blood is a lot like The Abominable Dr. Phibes And Dr. Phibes Rises Again. It's A great Vincent Price Film."
3,Answering the critics . . .,"Theater of Blood is an over the top romp that just can't be taken seriously. Horror maestro Vincent Price is Edward Lionheart, a Shakespearean actor who takes his revenge on group of critics that failed to acknowledge his talent, driving him to attempt suicide. Aided by his daughter Edwina (Diana Rigg), and an odd collection of homeless people, Lionheart administers a gruesome version of justice with a profoundly Shakespearean bent. The offending critics are dispatched in a series of creatively wacky and dramatic executions.The tone is pretentious, and the humor very dark. Price seems to delight in this role. Robert Morely's performance as a poodle aficionado is just precious. Price's duel with Ian Hendry is another highlight. Avoid the release by Alpha Video, as the image quality is extremely poor."
3,And you thought blackbirds in a pie were disgusting,"There's not much of a plot here, but watching Mr. Price's character concoct and carry out all kinds of interesting murders based on classic Shakespeare scenarios is black humor at its finest. There's a good bit of gore and several memorably disgusting images (those poor poodles!), but as none of this is meant to be taken all that seriously, such scenes aren't that hard to take. The DVD offers a nice widescreen image of a good source print."
3,"Great film, Lousy transfer","A film that deserves it's title! Vincent Price and Diana Rigg are truly outrageous as the merry murderers. The gore element could have been toned down, but an otherwise good film. What lets it down is the awful transfer. MGM has used a decades old laserdisc transfer and it shows. The picture is soft and grainy and full of nicks and scratches. The soundtrack is even worse. Distorted and hard to understand at times, this could have used some cleaning up. MGM should have put some money into remastering this wonderful title for DVD release. Shame"
4,BLOODY GOOD,"An average actor, deluded and grandiose, successfully counterpoints his critics as they drop like flies. Anyone with verve enough to ridicule him shall meet with a Bard-like demise (?). Wonderful murders, Vincent's priceless droll, and Diana Rigg to boot! Sophomoronic fun!"
5,Vincent Price At His *BEST*,"This movie is one of Vincent Price's *BEST* films, in my opinion. I bought the VHS around four years ago. I love the movie so much that I just bought the DVD. Vincent Price is truly brilliant in this film. If you love Vincent Price and you haven't seen this movie I suggest watching it."
4,"If revenge is a dish best served cold, Price delivers.","Nearly identical in structure to The Abominable Dr. Phibes, this Price vehicle is a tale of revenge, done Shakespeare-style. Like the Phibes films, we follow Price from murder to murder, wondering what ingenious trap will befall his next victim. Each meets his end with an extra helping of poetic justice, like the gluttonous character who is force-fed to death by Price. With a wonderful score, a quality print, and the beautiful Diana Rigg, this is another great entry into the Midnite Movies series by MGM. Recommended."
4,Fabulous film on a mediocre DVD,"Theatre of Blood has always been my favorite Vincent Price film. I saw it when it first came out , before I was legally entitled to see an ""R"" picture, and it is etched into my unconscious mind like a branded iron. Hammy, but always gracious, Price has the time of his life in this film, and Diana Rigg is marvelous in male drag.Unfortunately, MGM -- or whatever conglomerate now owns the rights to this film -- has chosen to do a careless, sloppy transfer to DVD, far less than this film deserves. The print is hardly pristine, and no effort has been made to improve it; the sound is muddy and you can scarcely hear Michael Lewis's haunting main title theme. Despite this, the DVD has an honored place on my shelf, at least until Criterion decides to tackle the vast and creepy Price back catalog."
4,fun for the not so squeamish,"extremely funny and bloody. Very nicely compliments the corman poes and the phibes films in the vincent price collection. Twice told tales goes well with this one, like the other two pairs do with each other, get them all.Hehe, loved to see him from get carter as a lead character... forgotten his name, but he always makes me laugh when we're supposed to take him seriously (as a gangster or a spy or a hitman etc etc... all of which professions are denoted by his ridiculous 70s sideburns and his shades) so nice to have a film where we're supposed to laugh at him'meridith merridew, this is your dish' is the choicest moment amongst many"
5,Absolutely entertaining.,I don't recall having seen a film where the actors enjoyed more playing their roles. They seemed to have had a ball.
4,Relevant History,"Excellent read for local historians and civic groups venturing into making local history more inclusive and meaningful. James Oliver Horton and Lois E. Horton have assembled a collection of essays that are timely in attempting to present public history. The essays reveal the difficulty and controversy surrounding topics involving the Civil War, slavery and race."
5,Best dance song I've heard for a long time!,"This song is so good; a upbeat, fun, clever dance song. Something you don't see too often. The singer's voice is very nice, compliments the song very well."
4,Inspirational,"This compact but profound book offers an examination from a Christian perspective of the concept of hope, why it is crucial to human existence and what constitutes true hope. Maalouf is eloquent, thought provoking and inspirational in his encouragement, offering specific steps to cultivate hope in one's own life."
1,this movie is repulsive,"this movie after seeing it is very repulsive,disgusting,and disgraceful.i recommend this to no one.dont waste your time and money."
1,ILHM Reviews Breeders,"For an awful journey into the strange and unexplained, look no further than Tim Kincaid's BREEDERS from 1986. BREEDERS is consistently terrible from start to finish. The police have a serial rapist on their hands, but the female victims are unable to recall any of the details surrounding the horrible events. They soon discover that the acid burns and viscous black fluid found on the victims bodies have been left behind by an alien life-form that must breed with human women! BREEDERS follows four basic steps: woman talks about her virginity, woman gets raped, police are baffled, repeat. The mindless dialog is only made worse by the stifled performances from each of the talentless cast members. We haven't seen this much bad rubber monster rape since HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP! Any film that can turn excessive nudity and gore into a borefest deserves to sit on the shelf.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,OMG!Terrible!,"This is the worst horror movie I've seen! Apparently, they think showing white women with tiny tits and flat asses would better the movie. Some of the worst acting and the monster was laughable. The excuse of this being an 80s movie is useless because there are many great 80s horror movies, The Thing, Aliens, The Shining, The Blob, A Nightmare on Elm St, The Poltergeist to name a few. I believe most great horror films came from this era but this one is just plain stupid!"
2,"Randy, Bug-Eyed Goo Men...","BREEDERS is sort of a cross between HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP, INSEMINOID, and INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS. Unlike these films however, BREEDERS is annoyingly dull. Yes, nearly every female disrobes within seconds of appearing, but this does nothing to make the rest of this imbecilic mess bearable! No laughs. No tension or drama. No point. Just human blocks of wood parroting their lines. This one gets an extra star for the mutant offspring w/ the sideways mouth. Other than that, it's rancid..."
3,More nudity than you can spank a monkey at!!!,"This is one of those films you buy just for the skin content. There are 5 or six women that get buck naked, and it's a constant theme throughout the film. Awesome. Simply awesome.The acting is absolutely atrocious--wow is it bad--but the director is clearly the kind of guy who focuses on things other than the acting, if you follow me. Lots and lots of naked women. What could be better in a lousy movie? At least this movie has the redeeming factor of abundant flesh to make up for the horrible acting, which so many other crappy films don't have.Any guy that loves nekkid chix will have no problem with this film."
1,"Aliens are bulletproof, but not boardproof.","Earth women gettin' raped by aliens. How could you mess that up? Well leave it to ol' Tim Kincaid, mastermind behind such hits as ROBOT HOLOCAUST and THE OCCULTIST to figure out a way.It really is rare to see a movie this bad and not just overall bad like WILD, WILD WEST or SIGNS but bad on every single level. Directing, acting, script, FX, sets, continuity, everything and what makes it even worse is it wasn't funny bad, but painful bad.Well, actually it was a little funny especially when one of the main characters beard disappeared!!!!!!!!!! Also the deformed alien baby was funny. I liked it when the cop shot the baby five times with no effect then just picked up a board and clobbered it over the head and killed it."
3,Amateurish but guiltily entertaining sci-fi horror.,"Cheesy and badly acted, but really amusing sci-fi/horror flick about an alien running loose and impregnating women. This 77-minute feature is mostly an excuse to show a lot of nudity, and it's probably because of the major abundance of T&A; (especially from the very sexy Frances Raines) that this is as fun a movie to watch as it is. Hilariously awful acting from Teresa Farley as the doctor.** 1/2 out of *****"
5,Hallmark 4 Pack,Good movies. Like having the opportunity to view themall and on one disc. Makes more room to buy more.
5,This is a Christmas gift so I know we love two to them.,Two of these movies we watch on netflix on our Roku netstreaming box fairly often. As this is a gift the package is unopened but I imagine we'll love these too!
2,Hallmark 4 Pack,The ad said number of discs: 4.There are only actually 2 discs with a movie on each side.I ordered because it said 4 discs so therefore I was disappointed.
3,Family film,I liked 2 of the movies and 2 of them were just OK for me. I still got my moneys worth and would still buy them like this in the future.
4,Check flicks,"Fun, happily-ever-after movies with enjoyable story lines and acting. I will watch them over and over. Wholesome entertainment for whole family."
4,This is not really a review,"This is not really a review. I just wished to add this information about the four movies included in this collection. I hope it is useful.Bridal Fever (2008) - TV Movie - 88 min - Romance - Director: Ron Oliver - Stars: Andrea Roth, Delta Burke and Gabriel Hogan.The Good Witch (2008) - TV Movie - 89 min - Family / Fantasy - Director: Craig Pryce - Stars: Catherine Bell, Chris Potter and Catherine Disher.For the Love of Grace (2008) - TV Movie - 88 min - Drama / Romance - Director: Craig Pryce - Stars: Mark Consuelos, Chandra West and Corbin Bernsen.Come Dance at My Wedding (2009) - TV Movie - 85 min - Drama - Director: Mark Jean - Stars: John Schneider, Brooke Nevin and Roma Downey."
2,Wish I wouldn't have purchased,"A good deal for four movies, but I should have looked closer because one of the movies was about witchcraft. I was able to salvage one movie which I haven't watched yet and just took the ads off the outside. Probably still a decent deal if that one movie turns out to be good."
4,Hallmark Delivers!!,Hallmark movies are the best. I Loved these movies and I know you will too. John Schneider was excellent in Come Dance at my Wedding. The good witch is the first of a series of movies that are really excellent.
4,Hallmark 4 Pack,"Great movies! Maybe not for the youngest, but nice movies for women. I really only wanted one of the movies. And found the other 3 quite nice."
5,A great value,"Four good movies for the price of one. A great deal, great service, and 4 good movies. How can u lose."
4,The Unfinished Autobiography,"A good book with which to start if you're new to metaphysics and even if you're not. It is always interesting to get to know an author once you've read her books or even before you begin. What an author has lived is, more often than not, experienced anew through writing; therefore, what better way to get the most out of an author's writings, than by reading her autobiography?"
1,"STINKY, STUPID STEREOTYPES","Stinky Jason does it again. The nasty thing is just a stereotype -- glasses = brains. (Incorrect equation, but a tired old chestnut that still has withstood the test of time in the funnies). Bubbleheaded sister Paige who has a makeup mirror for a brain and a blue collar big brother. Every stereotype is revisited in this collection. Jaason and his stereotypical siblings should be as extinct as the dinosaurs. The Foxtrot characters all have oven mitt shaped heads. These mitten heads live up to their tired stereotypes in this collection."
4,"Very funny, but recycled","As with all the other FoxTrot books, this one is hilarious. However, everything in this book has appeared before in other books. Had I known that, I would not have bought it. If you don't already have most of Bill Amend's other books, this is a good one to get. If you have many other FoxTrot books, expect everything in this book to look familiar."
5,One of Bill Amend's best,"This new Foxtrot collection is one of the funniest yet.The Camp Bohrmore series is hilarious.The whole Fox family is here, in this brand new book.What happens when Jason and Marcus become the A-V boys for their class?Or what happens when Roger floods the house?Find out in this awesome Foxtrot collection."
5,You'll want this as well..,I didn't want to spend the money on this one but I'm glad I did. It's very helpful to have something you can just toss in the wash when baby drools or spits up on the Bjorn and not worry about dirtying the carrier. Glad I got it!
1,Don't waste your money; put a bib around your baby's neck.,"Not wild about the Synergy carrier and definitely don't like these bibs that are supposed to go with it. The thinness of the material is a non-issue beacuse, they do have a non-permeable membrane to keep the drool from penetrating to the carrier, but a simple (and more cost-effective) plastic lined bib will do the same job. I don't like these overpriced bibs beacuse they fall off every time you put your baby in or take your baby out of the carrier. I hate to pay for something that is suppose to make your life easier and only proves to provide more frustration. I have found that a simple, plastic-lined (or not) baby bib works better for my baby in (and out of) the carrier and costs much less!"
2,Scratchy and falls off:(,I was disappointed that this didn't fit my active bjorn better. It also has a rough feel to it. It honestly works better just to put him in a bib and then tuck it into the front.
1,black bits falling off,this product has got black bits of towel/terry falling off right out of its packaging. i had to be picking up all the bits.. everywhere. on the carrier and even on my baby too.I wonder if it only happens for black?
3,Serves its purpose.,This is not what I expected. I assumed it would velcrow on or at least stay on the sling. It seems ones I would take the sling to take my child out the bib would fall to the ground most of the time only being able to use it once. There isn't a way to secure it.
3,Could easily use a bib and achieve the same thing,"Annoying to get on and the fabric feels very cheap. It surved the purpose but so could a bib. If you want the Bjorn to look stylish, buy it, if you want to just keep it from getting drooled on buy a bib and save some money."
1,Terrible,"Every single time I unlatch the carrier, this thing falls off. I've had to use a safety pin to hold it in place, which means I might as well just safety pin a burp cloth to the carrier. Oh, but that would cover up the BabyBjörn logo. We wouldn't want that!"
2,Waste of Money,Thin fabric. Pain in the neck to keep in place. Have to reposition or replace every time you take the carrier off. Better just to use a burp cloth.
2,You dont need these,I rarely used these you can just wash the baby bjorn when it is dirty and dont really need to spend your money on these.
2,ok,not super easy to put on with the baby in it and they fall of while you're putting the baby in it if you try to put it on before...not really necessary
3,Not bad,"Slides off the active model but keeps the drool off which is the point. Actually wish I'd just made a couple from an old tea towel, its a waste of money to be honest."
1,annoying!,I regret this purchase. These things are annoying to use - they are kind of hard to put on and always fall off when I put a baby in or take them out. I just end up sticking a burp cloth between the baby's face and my shirt.
4,It's pretty good,"It's a good product and fits very well with the Original, the Air and the Active-Sport carriers. I just wish that it could be a little bit softer though."
2,Bjorn bibs are ok...,"I was hoping that these would be thicker. They're super thin.....much thinner than a cheap hotel washcloth. I think I'll be better off folding a burp cloth over the Bjorn front flap so our little one can chew on it without the saliva soaking through. I was expecting the bibs to be more substantial than this, especially for the price."
5,Perfect for a chronic spitter-upper!,These bibs are perfect for protecting the BabyBjorn from spit-up and drool. They fit perfectly and stand up in the wash. Sometimes certain food stains don't come out but that seems to be the case with most bibs and the fact that I don't attack the stains right away. This is a great add on to the Bjorn I would highly recommend it for any Babybjorn purchase.
1,DOES NOT work with Baby Bjorn Comfort Carrier,"I recently ordered this item along with the Baby Bjorn Comfort Carrier. The bib product description states that it fits all Baby Bjorn carriers. Amazon, please update your product description. It clearly states on the outside of the bib product packaging that it DOES NOT fit the Comfort Carrier. I can't honestly review this product because I was not able to use it, but I wanted to get the attention of others with the 1-star rating. BUYER BEWARE!"
3,Handy and overpriced,Nice to have but not much better than using your own washcloth. Especially when you consider the price. I wouldn't think each cloth is worth more than 5 bucks
3,"Fine if you want it to look ""built in""","I find the function of these perfectly fine, but you'd probably do just as well with a bib hanging over the edge of the bjorn instead of tucked in. The only benefit is that these are branded with the Bjorn logo and fit well to the carrier so they look sharp and like they are a built in piece of the carrier."
1,Beyond an inflated sense of self worth,Beyond the Comfort Zone is a tedious read at best. It is nothing more than an egomaniacal piece of work from a juvenile author. Most disturbing are his notions of leadership. Save your money. American Canoe Association is sending this book free for joining. I question the ethics and morals of this organization for their choice in associating themselves with the morals and ethics voiced in this book.
3,Get the Same Information in Different Book,"If you buy ""Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings"" published by Wiley Investment Classics, you will find that the 'Other Writings' are the full text of this book, ""Developing an Investment Philosophy"" and the full text of his other popular book ""Conservative Investors Sleep Well"".This book contains good information, but the best bargain is to buy just the one book."
5,Roswell: The Next Chapter,"A lot of time, energy and thinking went into this book. It was very well written for a first time writer. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. This is definetly a must read for Sci-Fi readers. You will not be disappointed. I am looking forward to the next book to be written by Mr. Cotoggio."
2,Neither very erotic or entertaining. . .,"Those who seek this video for hot action of Christina Applegate as a stripper will be disappointed with all but about two minutes of this film. It's a rather dour tale of a Southern girl from a rich home (Applegate) who runs away from her ""evil stepmother"" (what the exact problem is with the stepmom is never adequately explained). An Italian drifter happens along and they strike up a romance, although she is rather abivalent. The film is basically about the ins and outs of their relationship. There's very little humor and not a lot of sexual heat--the main message seems to be ""life sucks, but it's all we have"". Based on a short story by Heidi Hall (""The Magnifcent Rescue""), who also scripted the film. Perhaps the s story had more of a point."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it.","I can honestly say that this movie wasn't interesting in the slightest. The only reason that I even watched it is that my best friend and I were extras in this movie. We were in the strip club scenes. It was great. I almost hit Christina in the face with a pool stick once. It was first going to be called ""Claudine's Return"" but they changed it. I wish someone had told me. I had to find out several years later from a friend of mine who found it on the internet. I thought that the movie had been scrapped or something. When I finally watched it, it bored me so much I had to fast-foward it to the scene that we were in. My friend did the same thing. Christina did a great job acting though. She has great talent but made a bad choice in making this movie. If they had chosen a different actress to play Claudine, it wouldn't even be worth renting."
1,I played a small role in this film,and I have to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched alot of the scenes being filmed and I can tell you that in her cocaine induced state she still can't act. I own it only because it reminds me of the days that I had long red hair... yeah that is me the amateur porn girl heheheh
1,Christina gets a paycheck,"The biggest gyp I've ever seen. The costume she wears is out of Annette Funicello and the 1950's. She has no heat - whatsoever, no dance moves either. This is strictly a marketting movie all about selling the cover."
5,AWESOME,"I love this cd,I'am a BIG ""weird al"" fan and thank you to Al looking through his website I found Stephen's cd and I'am very glad I bought it, it was worth every penny. I highly recommend it."
5,Tangled Strings--a rare treat,"A very talented musician and composer. Superb beat, a special blend of instruments. Serious, contemplative, sensual and sensitive. Highly recommended."
4,A good mix of musical styles that result in great music.,"I admit I only know Stephen Jay for his work with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, so I had no idea what to expect from this album. Even so, I was somewhat surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The songs have a good beat and the lyrics are... interesting. Jay's voice blends in well with the rhythm, especially with songs like ""You Are Alive"" and ""A Cool Dry Place"".I would definitely recommend buying this."
2,Why is this the only continent in the series?,"My issue with this book is not the actual counting in Kiswahili, but that the other books in this series are countries and not continents. This book could misinform a child that Africa is one large homogeneous group, and not made up of many different countries as well as cultures."
4,Secret Gardens of Santa Fe,"This is a beautiful book! I am designing a garden in Australia, this has given me so many ideas, from plant selection, colours, points of view and interest. Incorporating modern art and traditional building ideas. I hope you enjoy this too!"
5,Consistant quality and easy to dispense,"This product is great. It dispenses easily from the box, always sticks to the pad, and is long lasting. The price isn't bad either, and the shipping time is great."
4,Very Nice,"This device worked fine on my network with a little attention to detail... Here's how to configure it if using Windows XP.1) With the power off, plug in the printer to the print server's USB port. Plug one end of a standard network cable into your wireless router and the other into the print server.2) Plug the AC adaptor into the print server.3) Install & start the Bi-Admin software utility. It should seek out the print server successfully if your completed the first two steps. (An alternative is to use web interface to configure the networking settings, WEP etc - if you know the IP for the print server ahead of time)4) Configure the print server with the Bi-Admin utility. Record the IP number down of the print server for future use (eg 192.168.2.3) It should be readily displayed.5) Use the IPP printing protocol to setup your Networked printer under Windows. eg http://192.168.2.3Good luck, the print server is a decent product unlike other reviewers have stated."
2,Works well except on Vista SP1. Lousy support,"Purchase this product and worked well on Vista. Then upgraded to Vista SP1 and it caused Blue Screen of Death. Contacted support who initially rejected the problem. They told me that they could not duplicate the problem on a machine with only plextor software and Vista. After escalating, they submitted it to Engineering where nothing has happened for a month. Support does not issue incident numbers, does not track them, and has not done any follow up. When I contact them weekly they just state that engineering has it. Would not recommend any products from this company given this support and testing."
4,Captures good,"At this moment I have captured 6 VHS Tapes, and the quality is very good.I have just captured and stored in my hard disk. I have not used the video editor integrated, so at this moment I don't know if the editor software is good. In fact I prefer my own video editor software.The program for capturing is very easy to use.I have tested it in Windows XP SP2 without problems and in Windows Vista I had to install two times, the first one broke up, and in the second attempt it finished and worked fine.The capture software has been running very stable in both windows.For the price I think it is an excellent product for beginners. I liked my new gadget."
1,Black and White,"Could've been me, or bad connections. Who knows, but after fooling around with it for quite a while I was able to get either a good steady B&W transfer, or a garbled color transfer. Needless to say, I returned the product."
4,Blast from the past,This was an awesome show from the 80's. It's very dated now as far as effects are concerned but it's appropriate for kids and educational. There is a history lesson at the end of each show. The actor accidentally killed himself on set with a blank so there is just the one season. He was quite handsome and had a great future. I recommend this to any family.
4,History Lesson for all,"Although not exactly true to all facts, this series brings to life historical events that everyone should know. Basic history at it's best. It;s a pity it was cancelled so soon."
5,Finally!!!,"I am from Costa Rica and as a child I used to be a history buff (I still am) I just cannot forget this wonderful show, it give me such a wonderful sense of craving for knowledge. I am so grateful it will finally be released. In Costa Rica the show was recently broadcasted but now I will have my own dvd set. This show is a must have if you want to see a nice, innocent show or if you want your children to enjoy a non violent-educational show.I am so sorry about what happened to Jon-Erik Hexum, he was just 26 years old, I cannot help but thinking he would be around if they handn't cancelled the show."
3,"Great when I was a kid; as an adult, it's a bit dated","I really wanted an Omni when I was a kid. Still do I suppose. I bought this out of nostalgia, and while my kids and I enjoyed watching it, we had had enough by the times ran out of episodes. It's good for a trip down memory lane."
5,Great stuff,"This is even better than I remember it as a child. Just enough excitement to keep the kids interested, but not too much to be ""over the top"". Love it!"
4,Voyagers,this was one tv shows i watch whin i was growing up.so i got it for my grand kids to watch.
4,Time travel is fun,"I remember this series very well. The adventures and characters were delightful. Purchasing this item was nostalgic, and I am sharing the episodes with my grandchildren(who find the old television amusing)"
4,Voyagers,"This was a great family show. Wonderful for everyone to watch. You learn or re-learn your history in a fun way. Granted it's a little hokey for today, but that's part of the fun. I have shown it to neices and nephews alike and both have loved it!"
4,Voyagers; complete series,"I loved the show as a kid, wished it had lasted longer than 1 season... seeing the DVD's brought back all the old memories. I wanted to learn more history as a kid because of that show. (if the producers are reading, I am a writer, if you ever want to revive the show, I have some great ideas.) Thanks again......."
5,Voyagers Omni Fan,Finally Voyagers is released onto dvd love all the episodes incl the pilot where we see Pre-V:The Original Miniseries Actress Faye Grant guest star. Also we see Soleil Moon Frye's brother Meeno Peluce Star in. Episodes deal with Historical Events kind of like Quantum Leap. Omni device is way cool wish the dvd came with one incl. Too bad it lasted only one season would be cool to see many seasons with more historical events.
2,cute at first but got boring,"I watched this as a child, it seemed to have been important to me back then, now I wonder why. I had a few chuckles, but there's not much variety in the plot. My kids even got bored, they still haven't gotten to disc 2. The actors worked well together, but every episode was pretty much the same."
5,Delightful Show for a New Generation...,"Like many reviewers here, I watched this show as a child - and am so happy it has been preserved for the next generation... Twenty and thirty-somethings - get it for your kids, and yourselves. It is a delightful set of stories about how even heros struggle with self-confidence, and that with the right encouragement from people who care, we can all get our lives on track and make a difference. With a terrific mix and range of stories, this series celebrates intelligence, honor, and faith in one's own abilities and the future - wonderful lessons that are as badly needed now as 25 years ago."
4,Bring Back Your Childhood,"Whatever your age when you saw your first episode of Voyagers!, this DVD Set will bring back your childhood and Saturday morning cartoons. Truly original!"
2,Not the original,I thought I was buying the original looney tunes that I saw when I was a kid. This is not it so I was dissappointed.
1,Dumb,"The hero spends most of his time having sex with his fiancee , which incidentally, he does not love. Says quite a lot for his morals!!!"
2,Protective Pants,"The refastenable portion of this protective pants does not provide a snug fit. On one occasion I had the boost insert actually come out through the side of the under pants. In addition, the absorbent material in the underpants breaks up in sections when wet with urine."
4,work good,"My elderly mother has used a number of brands, but says these work best for her at night and around her home. They are easy for her to get on and remove, though they are too bulky for use under clothes when she is going out."
5,Just as expected!,This item came in quickly and as expected. I will be ordering this item as often as needed. Stores around me are not carrying this particular item. Grateful that Amazon does!
2,Too bulky,These are very bulky since one size fits all. They are hard for a handicapped person to put on and off by himself.
3,Useless except in emergency,"my mom has a foley catheter so I don't need an absorbant diaper, just one that covers her so BMs don't leak out. Even so, these diapers are USELESS! She only weighs 120 lbs and is a size 12 in clothes, but these supposedly Large/Extra Large diapers HARDLY COVER HER! How would they cover people with waists up to 48 inches? I never tried Depends before because I figure you get what you pay for. And I was right. These will be useful only in emergencies when no other diaper is available. It is really too bad because the better diapers are twice as expensive. From now on, nothing but the better kind."
3,Defects abound!,"I purchased these for my elderly father as part of a subscribe-and-save promotion that made them remarkably inexpensive (compared to the prices I was seeing at a local store) and was pretty pleased with them UNTIL the second delivery, whereupon almost 10 of the briefs came with legs glued to each other in such a way that unsticking them meant ruining the garment. What a waste!Still--these are good ones to use EXCEPT at night, when you might want to get yourself or your loved one these:Depend Fitted Maximum Protection Briefs (Formerly Overnite) Size Small/Medium Pk/20 .Those Maximum Protection briefs really do the trick. My father can go all night without a single leak, and it makes it far, far easier to do linens and the like the next morning when he uses those. They're more expensive, but worth it for night-time use."
3,Depends,"I purchase these Depends for my Elderly Mom...87, in Asst'd Living. They seem very bulky, and do leak, at times. Even have to purchase her slacks a size larger. Wish they had something more fitting and absorbent for smaller frail elderly ladies."
1,Depends 4-tab,"I ordered the 4 tab unintentionally. They are not useful for a bed-ridden patient. The 6-tab style is.They don't stay up well either, when contents are added to the weight. They are not useful for either of my parents."
3,my personal opinion as a caregiver,These are ok but I did expect more absorbtion of urine. They are easier to take off but the other styles are too.
1,Depend are good but this one hummmmm,"I get Depend for an old person, and are really good, why 1 star?, is the first time that I get this kind and I do not really like it, I prefer the noN adjustables.thats is only my opinion for this one, maybe you will like it but I prefer the others one.i can say I WILL NEVER YOU THIS AGAIN. I WILL USE THE NON ADJUSTABLES."
4,Oregon Pedometer,I purchased this as a gift for a friend who says it is a great asset when determining how much walking a true New Yorker really does. The only downfall was that it took awhile to get it correctly calibrated to measure effectively.
2,Wise at his worst...,"If anyone has doubts about the general mediocrity of Robert Wise's work as a director, ""Audrey Rose"" should remove them. It's a tensionless, tedious bore that fails to emotionally engage the audience. It has many of the same problems as ""The Haunting"", a slightly better (but still poor) film, most notably a loose and unfocused script. Long before the end of the film, you wish someone would defenestrate Ivy and set the /audience/ free.The '70s color cinematography is dreadful, with bright, generally flat lighting that rarely makes any attempt to set a mood or express emotion.Wise was pretty much an uninspired ""hack"" director. When the script and actors were good, he usually delivered a good film. When not, he contributed nothing of his own to fix the problems, or enhance the better elements of the material. I'm partly biased, because I don't believe in reincarnation, but a much better film could unquestionably have been made from this material."
3,"The characture ""Ivy"" was horribly cast but Hopkins was great","This was a strange and fassinating film, all the more so because it was based on a true story. The photography in this film is worth noting as it really adds to the mysery in setting up what is to come. Marsha Mason was wonderful, Anthony Hopkins was perfect and had they cast the role of Ivy as carefully as the other actors it would have been a much better film. The story line is really very good and focuses on reincarnation and even lending a degree of creedance to clarvoience. The film leaves the answers to a great many questions up to the individual viewer. I believe this was deliberate since the topic itself invites personal opinion. All though the ending is a bit week, I would reccomend seeing this film once. Not a movie I would reccommend for the home vidio library."
1,THE WORST Anthony Hopkins movie I have seen.,"I can't believe this movie is rated 3.5 stars overall. I almost never leave reviews, but I am writing this in hopes of helping drag the overall rating down where it belongs. Just about the only people who could like this movie are those who liked it when it first came out in the 70s. There were some great movies in the 70s of this type. The Exorcist was such a movie. This garbage was not."
1,Exorcist Spoof,"Gosh, now i know not to judge a video by its cover! When i rented it i thought it would be good ( practically anything is good with Anthony Hopkins ). When i watched it all throughout the film i kept thinking "" Shut that girl up!!!""! She was awful along with her father!! So much of the material was the same cliche!!! Especially from The Exorcist!! Take my advice, don't waste your money buying or renting this movie!"
4,Chilling reincarnation flick guaranteed to give goosebumps!,"Picture this: A 5 year old girl trapped, helpless, in an overturned and burning automobile. Therein lies the true horror of this film. This movie is positively chilling! A reincarnation storyline that doesn't need elaborate special effects or excessive blood and gore to keep the hairs on the back of your neck tingling. The plot doesn't suffer in the transition from book to big screen, even though it does lose some detail. If you like 70's era occult flicks (like The Reincarnation Of Peter Proud, Magic or The Amityville Horror), then you should like this."
4,The Comeback Kid...,"Basically, AUDREY ROSE is to reincarnation what THE EXORCIST is to demon possession. A little girl named Ivy (Susan Swift) is plagued by terrible nightmares, or are they really memories from a former life? Anthony Hopkins (Magic, Silence Of The Lambs) seems to be stalking Ivy for some unknown reason. The girl's parents (Marsha Mason and John Beck) are both afraid and angered by the stranger's relentless pursuit of their daughter. What does he want? What secret motive drives him? The story unfolds well and gives a good sense of the building dread / terror experienced by Ivy's parents. I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to all fans of supernatural thrillers..."
4,Okay,"This is for fans of Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen kind of. It's about riencarnation. Pop in the Dvd and watch the theatrical trailer first, then watch the film. A shocking ending. Haven't read the book. Some of the acting is hokey, but it can be forgiven. Rent it!"
3,Really stupid. I wasted my time watching it.,I wasted my time watching this one. It was pretty entertaining up until the end. The dad was very annoying and the little girl also started to get annoying. The ending was really dumb. I wasted two hours of my time watching this one. The only reason I'm giving the movie three stars instead of one is Anthony Hopkins. I really like him and he is a good actor with a very pleasant accent.
3,Hot Hot Hot Young Anthony Hopkins!,"Okay, that was a joke, 'Hot, hot..."" is a line from the movie...But he was quite dashing. C'mon! That's why I bought it! Otherwise, this super-creepy film doesn't really merit a second glance. Once is enough. Marsha Mason plays frazzled again- and she is good at it. Tony Hopkins makes a nice father figure. (But then you see glimpses of Hannibal coming through). This is a film best given to the local psychic for seance material, or as a Halloween Party Door Prize. Or just watch it for fun. I did say it was Creepy..."
3,"uneven, 2 halves not a whole","This reminded me of million dollar baby, where the first and second halves of the movies were almost separate films. The first half of this one is a horror/thriller like several others of that era (exorcist). The second half was like a documentary on reincarnation and hinduism.Still, the film was definitely watchable and overall entertaining. The acting by Hopkins and Mason was excellent. Ending was a surprise, not what I would have guessed."
5,A great prayer resource for your family,"This special book by Fr. Antoine Thomas will be a wonderful resource for your family. Each of the 30 brief (two to three pages) chapters contains the following sections:*Illustration and quotation*My Question - a first person query on a particular topic*The Word of God - relevant scripture passages*Prayers*A Friend of Jesus - a quote from a saintThe books resources on the Mass, scripture, the Rosary, the liturgical seasons and much more will be helpful to your family both at Eucharistic adoration and at any time of prayer."
4,A Young Girl's Diary,i loved this book it was a sad and fun book at the same time it has a surprising ending and anyone who reads it will love it. i wish there was a sequal. i would pay to read it.
2,Wishy washy,"2 1/2Inundated with far too much hippie-dippy technique sold far past its expiration date, Allen's admirable compositional skills take a back seat to patented quirky delivery."
4,Much better than ad exec wallpaper music,"Da Lata have made a fine, fine album - sensual, rhythmic musical. It's not bossa nova, but it is *influenced* by it. Using modern sounds and textures, they've created a wonderful soundscape that can also make you move. I would advise ignoring the dissenting review - it seems as if the gentleman is expecting the girl from Ipanema to walk thorugh his door any minute now..."
5,Put your dancing shoes on!,"I'm usually very critical when it comes to evaluating music in general but this cd had nothing to be critical about. The beats flow through your body striking the core of your spirit leaving you with no choice but to dance. Although this cd does not contain the traditional outstanding beats that most brazilian music puts forth, it's more mellow undertones lift you high above to a place of utter enjoyment. The beautiful vocals only add to the experience. I strongly recommend this cd. You won't be disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money on this tape,"This video is a rip-off. It's nothing but a lot of talking and not much singing. I thought I was going to see at least one full song, but not, only tibits of songs here and there. Just a lot of bull. Thus, the cheap price."
5,View Out the Window,"Life's loneliest roads of grief and death are overwhelming; but there is a friend in these times. The great Friend has a troubador who can take our hearts straight to his door--who can open the window on the piece of the sky where hope and peace glimmer in the dark hours. Tears shine,the reality of hope glows, and the last ray of sunset lights upon the path through the wilderness; the ray of light glimmers on Michael's guitar strings, and the wind sings in his voice."
5,Satisfaction,"The fiends have been around, seemingly for an eternity and a day, and they haven't lost a step. The in between bits (wild green fiendy liquid, and spot you lucky wasts)on this album are excelent, but what really does it are the covers."
1,Not even worth ...,"Like most MattelInteractive game titles for children, this game features circa 1995 graphics and gameplay, a major disapointment for children accustomed to games with true 3-D rendering and animated play."
4,Deserves to be read,"The book shows a in-depth investigation, and deserves to be read, even though the style is not outstanding. Anyone who uses a computer, or whose life is somehow influenced by computers (i.e., anyone on the Earth's surface), should be reading it. Can't wait until its distribution worldwide."
5,Rohm reveals the true nature of Gates & Co.,"Everyone should read this book. It's rather scary that so much of the information infrastructure of the world is based upon the products of one company. And Rohm has shown that one company to be ruthless in its acquisition of technology and its destruction of its competitors' ability to compete. While working at a major US corporation, I've seen the results of Microsoft's strategy as first all of the Macs disappeared... then we said farewell to Netscape as well. Rohm explains eloquently how it all happened."
2,"Interesting Facts, Ackward Story","Overall, the book contains what appear to be well investigated facts and plausible conclusions. However, from page one, the book starts to read like some dime store spy novel. Fortunately, it sheds that drama, but it still remains ackward by jumping around chronologically.If you can get around the attempt at high drama (rarely do ""behind the company curtain"" stories make great high drama for those who were not involved), you will certainly find out some interesting facts and understand how Microsoft executives have been able to delude themselves into believing they are not doing anything wrong."
3,Read It,"This volume suffers greatly from the obvious lack of a strong editor. Some stories are started but never finished while others are told two or three times. People appear in the narrative without even being introduced. Incidents are referred to but never described. It has the feel of a series of separate articles shoved together and rushed into print to catch a cresting issue. Read it anyway. Because despite its sometimes poor organization and tendency to forget where it's been, it also contains a large amount of information about Microsoft's business practices, much of it from Microsoft's own documents and much of the rest from eyewitness accounts of meetings. And if half - no, if a quarter - of what the book alleges is true, Microsoft deserves everything the Justice Dept. and the states can throw at it."
5,Interesting and Informative,"Microsoft has maintained its position in the computer world. This book gives you an insight on how the software giant (and its leader) conducts business. You will also meet the heads of other companies, and how they react to Bill Gates moves. Enjoyable."
2,Weak. There are better Gates books available.,"I found the writing to be choppy, and some of the ideas presented to be a bit of a stretch: For example: The author attempts to make us believe the Bill Gates is 90's equivalent of John D. Rockefeller. On the surface there are many similarities, but where the comparison falls apart is that people truly need oil, they don't need software. I, as a user of a personal computer can happily run WordPerfect on DOS 5.0 for as long as I want. The same can't be said for the oil to heat my house or run my car. Oil eventually runs out.I think there are better books about Gates, if you're interested, I liked Mane's ""Gates : How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry-And Made Himself the Richest Man in America"""
2,A little too tabloidish for my taste.,"I bought this book hoping to find the real ""case against Bill Gates"", or more specifically against Microsoft. Goodness knows he and his cronies made plenty of secret business deals that, exposed to the light of day, would really damage the company. A book detailing (and, more importantly, documenting) all these things I've been trying to tell people for years would at the least make me seem less of a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist among my peers.But, unfortunately, this book seems to concentrate mainly on what kind of a person Bill Gates is, including a truly baffling amount of coverage of Bill's courting of some woman who worked for Microsoft. I don't care about that [stuff]; I want to see the LEGAL case against him, not things that belong in the gossip column.Thus disillusioned, I never finished the book, so for all I know it may contain what I hoped to find, but if so, it's not in the first half of the book."
1,A torture to read,"Awful, awful, awful. This book is truly awful. How this dreck gets published, I'll never understand. Wendy Goldman Rohm manages to reduce the interesting and complex saga of Microsoft and Bill Gates into a lurid, third-rate soap opera. The writing is out and out laughable at times, especially when the author delves into the main characters' heads to tell us what they are thinking. You'll have to look elsewhere to find the real story of Microsoft's rise to the top."
1,Abysmal,"I couldn't get past the first four pages -- I wanted factual reportings, not some drivel from a would-be novelist. The book is written from a first-person perspective of the characters involved -- Bill Gates, folks at the Justice Dept., Microsoft Lawyers, etc. In trying to capture their states of mind, and then writing as if she were those people, she's stepped outside the bounds of journalism and into TV-movie scriptwriting. I tried twice to read this book, then I returned it."
3,"Subject Matter Interesting, Writing Style Distracting","After having read the book ""Apple : The Inside Story of Intrigue, Egomania, and Business Blunders"" I was curious to see the ""other side"" of the computer world, and I read this book. Although I found the melodramatic writing style distracting and that a bit too much literary license had been taken, I must give the writer some props for trying to put together a tome of otherwise boring and inundating material into a readable form for the masses. I felt the book was informative, and clear in it's presentation, if not a smidge one sided (against Microsoft). It's not a bad read, and aside from all the melodrama (which I just skimmed through anyway), I would say I liked it. Check it out if you're interested in getting some information on how Microsoft has been allegedly (and in my opinion, truly) handling itself and it's monopoly."
1,Boring book; rehashed cold potatoes,"According to Ms. Goldman, when the then-single Bill Gates went out with a single woman, it was a ""liaison"" not a date. And so it goes. The normal and the commonplace are hyped to seem like the secret and the mysterious. I learned nothing from this book. Unlike Pam Edstrom's book, ""Barbarians at the Gate"" which has some real ""insider"" insights, this is a pretentious, boring book that rehashes well-documented old stories about Microsoft and its competitors(a huge amount of space is devoted to how Lotus was sold to IBM, for example). What has not been told before was simply made up. A titillating title, but ""where's the beef?"""
3,Great Reference for Steamship China Collectors!,"Anne Anderson's tome on the cube teapot is without doubt the definitive history on the subject. Of special interest to steamship china collectors is the impressive number of photographs showing the cube tea service in use on board the old Cunard ocean liners. There were a number of different patterns applied to the service and Anne provides us with an excellent photographic reference of each one. Loaded with vintage photographs, this book is a must have for collectors of this type of china. I am so happy to see books like this documenting something that would otherwise be lost forever that I am reluctant to offer criticism. The narrative in the book, while thorough, could use a bit more editing to smooth it out. There are several typos in the book as well as instances of paragraphs with random facts thrown in that are irrelevant to the main idea being presented. Hence my rating of three stars."
4,no slip paper,"adheasive on back holds paper tight to pad, sands faster, last longer, easy to change. GREAT"
4,Soul revvin' true music.,"Lost and Found puts out a fresh, new sound that will get you hooked as soon as you start listening. They radiate an incredible vibe that emerges from the authentic message of their songs."
4,"Moving, funny, sad...","This book is really a collection of vignettes about an interesting and remarkably alive girl growing up in a quintessential middle American town in Ohio. Like Mona Simpson without the emotional fireworks, the stories are sustained by the freshness and depth of the central character. Her love interest is not as clearly drawn, but the women around him are carefully and poignantly depicted. The whole story has a sadness and sweetness which is leavened by her keen and often humorous observations. The stories are strongest when told from the point of view of the young girl, and saddest when the author assumes an omniscient voice. This is good stuff, I'm looking forward to more from Lynn Lauber."
1,"Just because you can, it doesn't mean that you should.",This song is one of the biggest pieces of junk from the early rave scene. Enough said.
2,"Exellent selection, but bad sound quality","Femmes de Paris series is an excellent set of groovy female songs of that era, so buying this disk is generally good idea. But keep in mind that most records are not restored, so be prepared for noize and cracks."
1,I woudn't recommend this product.,"After using these hex sockets on a impact the roll pins that hold them in snapped off. The hex bit is not a press fit into the socket like most other brands. I traded them off for a different set and am glad I did. S-K ususally has pretty good tools, and I would recommend their combination wrenches to anyone. However, this product simply has a poor design and isn't worth buying."
2,too thin sheets for sanding,"I purchased Mirka gold as it was a very good price. However when I received it, and used it with my sander the paper was so thin it did not last for very long, so the economy of the purchase price was not for me effective. I still prefer 3m products, though they may cost more to begin with, you can use them over and over again on a small project."
5,great for ethics continuing education,This is a must read for clinicians. Check out myceusage to see how to earn CEU's in california for this book.
5,Genes're us,"I have never written a review before, but in the case of ""Living with our Genes"" I feel I must recommend this book most highly. Of all the books I have read on this subject - and on other science subjects - I have to say that this book is among the best. It is witty, wise and enormously informative. At the same time the laid-back style makes the book as readable as a good novel. I, for one, couldn't put it down. Here you have a book in the best tradition of top scientists talking with complete assurance about what they really know - delivered in the informal style of a tutorial by a very good teacher, in love with his subject. I have to say that to make the best of this book you should have also read the seminal book on this subject - Richard Dawkins' ""The selfish Gene"". R.F."
4,Living with Our Genes,"This book offers an easy to understand look into how genes affect a human's personality, addictions, and behaviors. If the reader is unfamiliar with DNA and genetics, the authors do a wonderful job of putting the concepts in simple and concrete terms. Even if one is knowledgable in the genetic's field, this book provides some new and interesting ideas. After reading this book, one will be enlightened with a better understanding of themselves and others from a biological viewpoint."
4,"This book is readable, informative and up to date.","Having recently read Bertrand Russell (many), Robert Pirsig's ""Lila"", E. O. Wilson's ""Consilience"", Richard Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene"", Steven Pinker's ""How the Mind Works"" and Douglas Adams' ""Dirk Gently"" and ""Hitchhiker's Guide"", this book falls right in line philosophically and subject-wise. A fast read with the exception of pausing to muse, many interesting genetic factors as they pertain to our behavior are explored. The D4 dopamine receptor, homosexuality and personality types are covered with tasteful insight. This book was a pleasure to read."
2,A misleading yet entertaining pop culture book.,"The main problem with this book is that it fails to introduce any new information regarding the so caled ""nature-nurture"" debate. A disappointment because it failed to offer anything new to this field, entertaining because of it's pop culture vignettes and slangy writing. Not useful for any type of intellectual advancement."
3,"Good, but there's better to be found","The book cover describes this book as ""groundbreaking"", but it's not. In fact, it's really quite light. In a fashion typical of psychologist, it tells many quaint stories about people that the authors seem to believe makes their discussion more interesting, but really just insults the readers' intelligence. This book makes a decent attempt to describe the relationship between genes and behavior. It's a good place to start. But it reads like it were written for first-year college students, and merely restates things that are much better stated elsewhere. If you want a book that does a MUCH better job, and is much better written, try Matt Ridley's excellent book ""Genome"", or his more dense ""The Red Queen"". And for serious books that truely are groundbreaking, try E.O. Wilson's ""On Human Nature"" or Richard Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene"". Each of those books are significantly better than ""Living With Our Genes."""
3,The future belongs to the genetically perfect,"I've been living with my genes for a long time now. It's like living with a violent, crazy family member, one that'll be nice one day, and bury a butcher knife in your back the next. This book reminds me how hopeless the whole thing is - the future belongs to the genetically perfect. Me? I'm disqualified -crooked, decay-prone teeth, eyeglasses, and male pattern baldness. Only the preppies will be allowed to breed. Guys like me will be hunted down and killed."
5,Excellent book for those who never majored in biology/psych.,"The authors did an excellent job in explaining how genetics determine behavior, etc. The fact that basically anyone can now understand the basics of DNA is a complement to the authors."
5,I thought this book was extremely interesting & informitive.,"I really injoyed this book. I learned alot and everything made sence. The author explains in way anyone can enjoy it. You learn how we are and why we are that way, in a scientific way."
3,Good but often not in-depth enough,"Overall, I liked the content matter of the book but I often felt the writing was uneven. In some parts, the writing seemed to be geared toward a very uneducated audience, almost to the point of being insulting; at other times, some advanced terms were not explained at all and glossed over. It almost seems as if the authors wrote this book in haste, without adequate revision, as I found many spelling and grammar errors.Nonetheless, the content was intriguing and thought-provoking and what I liked was that the authors provided a balanced mix of research from various science fields, rather than just from genetics.However, I often felt like I wanted a lot more from this book in evidence and research than it gave and couldn't help but feel that it was too ""pop"". For comparison, I recommend reading Stephen Jay Gould who has a knack for writing about science in an engaging way and yet without either glossing over the details or confusing you with too many technical terms."
3,The strength of facts do not compensate the weakness of...,"I wanted to research this book to no end. The lack of footnotes and endnotes angered me to no end. For that reason, the authors are speaking out of their hats. This book is merely speculation until there is a credible resource attached to it (no time soon). To put it in a frame regarding the author, ""this is what I think is true and must be true, anything else is wrong since there was nothing using the parameters I thought were relevent at the time (which I won't verify nor make accountable) to say otherwise.In other words, this book is worth a grain of salt in it's information. It may start the broadening of horizons for others. That much is reasonable."
5,The Killing Room,"Excellent read. Gerri is an master of weaving plots to keep you interested in wanting to know the out come. I find it difficult not to read the entire book at one sitting. I highly recomment this book, and I don't think you'll be disappointed. I wasn't."
3,Look around a little more...,Bought this for my son's campouts with Boy Scouts which is once a month. Haven't had it for a year and is wearing down. I think I would agree with the reviewer that compared it to cotton balls in a ziplock bag. I'll be looking for another pillow soon.
4,Dontae is near perfection,"Dontae's ballad cd is great. I just can't believe that I met this young man several years ago. The rich, brassy sound of the trumpet is magnified by the spirit and power of Dontae's talent. I greatly suggest this cd to any jazz fan that wants to see glimpes of the past while viewing the future of jazz."
4,Great flixble wrenches,Love em except these wrenches are very long which makes them impractical as your primary use ratchet. If these were a few inches shorter they would make a perfect tool.
1,Speechless,"Wow, what can I say. 15 minutes of the most amateurish narration I have ever heard, saying the same things over and over again with the same 3 photographs and then 40 minutes of ""Raw"" footage which consists of what looks like some guy walking around in his backyard but we don't know because there is no narration or dialog just random pictures and the ""Raw"" footage and some captions.I can't believe that Amazon is charging for what appears to be a high school history project and a poor one at that as a full length documentary.Do NOT download this film you WILL be disappointed."
2,Google search more effective,"Don't waste your money. You can look up Billy Gohl on the internet and learn more about him. The ""movie"" is more of a slide show lasting 15 minutes with narration. Then you get to watch the same 15 minute slide show without the narration. I had never heard of Billy Gohl and was ver interested in this documentary, but was very disappointed when I viewed it. Even the 15 minutes of narration repeats information several times, undoubtably to prolong it. I enjoy true crimes and mysteries, especially serial killers, but this documentary is not worth the purchase price. It views more like an amateur film student project. Again, the internet will provide more satisfying results if you want to learn the story of Billy Gohl (pronounced like ghoul, somewhat ironic)."
2,Great High School Project,"Poorly done, slow moving and boring. Reminded me of a nicely done project for a high school class. Should have been 10 minutes long."
1,Amazon should be ashamed,You should be ashamed of yourself for even listing this terrible amateur slideshow much less charging for it. Anyone who has rented this movie deserves a double refund for the offense.
1,DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR THIS,This is a total rip-off. It sounds like a bad narrator reading a 5th grade report that is poorly written. And the narration lonly lasts a few minutes before there is no narration only slides of the same photos playing over and over again. I did not listen to previous reviews BUT I SHOULD HAVE!! Don't make the same mistake I did - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
2,"Amazing trip, disappointing video","The trip this video documents was amazing, but the video is not worth the money. It's low-quality, short on material (especially video), and sputters along. Too bad."
4,Fast Moving Action In Louisiana,"Talba Wallis is a hip young Private Investigator who also happens to be Black and a poet. A friend of hers dies. Police consider it a suicide. But, Talba and the deceased girls ex fiancee think otherwise. The ensuing investigation comes up with plenty of action and reveals skeletons in many closets including that of a favored gubernatorial candidate as well as those of prominent local families. A quick solid read."
5,Annie Herring - There's a Stirring,The golden voice of the Jesus Movement and one of the pioneers of Contemporary Christian Music only gets better with age! A must have for all 2nd Chapter of Acts fans!
2,this hose is garbage,"I bought this hose so I can tap off the compressor to send a guy to do strapping around the house. this hose is heavy plastic/rubber. I bought it because it was cheap and we constantly are breaking hoses. I guess in the summertime when it gets hot, the hose will get softer."
4,Props to electroslide,"Somehow I missed their first album but I was able to get my hands on Near Life Experience. Now I must say, I have alot of respect for these folks and what they can do, but some tracks I just can't hang with. None-the-less what I hear on this album is a truckload of potential and some wonderful tracks to keep me happy with my purchase. Several tracks have a sound reminicent of St. Germain, others of old 45 jazz and funk albums, yet somehow they also get in some experimental electronic / downbeat / dnb-ish / jazz influenced numbers. Some I think they could do without. If you're looking for something new to round out a collection by all means check this group out. If not its inconsistency may turn many people away. Still deserving of four stars for the effort though :)"
1,Provides incorrect information on breastfeeding benefits.,"Very negative book.Author disregards scientific studies and proofs of breastfeeding benefits. She also characterizes LaLeche League members as cultists,which is totally false information. I found this book to be irresponsibly written because it leaves the uneducated reader misinformed."
1,Irresponsible,"I don't think anyone should judge a mother for her feeding choices--what business is it of ours? Unless we are the family's healthcare providers, none.But this book was written with ridiculously poor research methods. Statements by breastfeeding mothers are assumed to be biased, while statements from bottlefeeding mothers are taken as gospel truth.The comparison of the ""breastfeeding movement"" to a religious cult was laughable.Most comprehensive baby care books cover bottlefeeding. Get one of those instead."
3,I think that people take feeding much too seriously.,"happy bottlefeeding is much better than miserable breastfeeding and vice versa. babies can sense the tension in an unhappy mother. I breastfed my baby, but after 4 months he didn't want to anymore so i had no choice. He would scream forever it seemed when i tryed to put him to my breast. I felt extremely guilty after giving up and bottlefeeding. THe book helped me to feel better, but I didn't like the attack on breastfeeders since I was offered so much help by them."
1,"Misplaced ""Advice""","What a nasty view of breastfeeding and breastfeeders. Yes, breastfeeders shouldn't condemn, either. Every situation IS different and of course there are those who cannot breast feed. But a world of variation does not change one simple fact: breast feeding, if possible, is best for the baby. Big-company formula recipes do not replicate eons of nature. One wants to ask the author ""What exactly do you think breasts are for, and why do they produce milk? Are they the creation of a conspiracy?!"" If you cannot breastfeed, take heart, be strong and forge ahead. But don't use this book to attain peace of mind. It's too negative."
1,A poorly researched and written rant,"My husband and I both read this book together. I was appalled at the poor research compiled by Ms. Robins, and amazed at how badly the book read. It was not informative, it was argumentative. The topics would start out in an informed manner, but then quickly collapse into either a rant about breastfeeding, or misinformation, or more frightening, incorrect information. My mild mannered husband was moved to shouting at the idiocity of her '38 reasons' since the vast majority of them put the mother's wants before the needs of the child. And that's selfish.Don't waste your money on this book, that's my suggestion."
1,This book is self indulgent catharsis,"This book does little to address the real issues of guilt experienced by mothers who cannot breastfeed. I mean REALLY cannot, not just can't be bothered. I would love to have breastfed my adopted babies, but lacked the information and courage to induce lactation. This book is nothing but a slam on breastfeeding and I wouldn't be surprised if the author owns mega shares in Mead Johnston"
1,Sad,"When I picked up this book, I was curious. I am a breastfeeding mother, but I thought that it was nice that a book would support women who CAN NOT breastfeed. Instead, this book seems to have the attitude, ""Formula is just as good, and it doesn't matter one way or the other"". Funny how it didn't mention that over 8,000 babies die in this country alone as a result of not receiving their mother's milk! Formula should be considered something to fall back on when all else has failed, not as an equally good choice."
1,This author just hates breastfeeding,"I was given this book by a well-meaning friend who had not read it. I have since thrown it out.This author is just angry and misinformed. Her ""medical"" information is misleading and often downright WRONG. It's really sad when a book like this becomes popular.If you want real information on bottlefeeding with love, read the bottlefeeding chapters from Dr. Sears' The Baby Book."
1,If you are having problems breastfeeding,"Then read one of the books which teaches you different approaches or alternative holds, or call la leche, or find a local lactation consultant; don't just give up on something that is so important for your baby, just because a self-centered writer says that it's not really as good as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization say."
3,ANNE I AM is a Moron,i just had to vent about Anne I Am. She says women who breastfeed are of lower education. What if things do go right breastfeeding. should a woman starve her baby in order to now feed guilty by the lactivists? I just had to vent folks.
1,A Negative Book,"This book just left me w/ negative feelings. It seems to me that the author is very angry and is set on defending herself against women who choose to breastfeed and are successful. She assumes that those successful women are all anti bottle feedding zealots. It is not fair to judge people by the way they feed their child. Nobody can know their true feelings. I think that the authors obvious anger makes her book very biased and so it does not give out good information. I would like to see a book about bottle feeding and positive mothering without making the book into a breastfeeding bashing session, which this book clearly is. The idea was great, but this woman is just too emotionaly involved to write an unbiased book."
1,Terrible toy,Do not buy this toy! It broke in the first 5 minutes and the company would not take it back. These are very cheaply made. Our friend's son was so disappointed. It looks so cute in the picture but it is very flimsy.Worst toy EVER!
5,GREAT PURCHASE,THIS IS VERY CUTE AND GREAT QUALITY. MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT AND I ACTUALLY ORDERED 2 FOR HER KITCHEN. WOULD RECOMMEND
3,Just ok,I bought this to go w/the shower curtain. It is not the greatest quality. It seems more like a kitchen type of rug than for a bathroom.
2,Vindicated?,"In a 1997 Amazon review of this book, canon lawyer Edward Peters called attention to a review he published in an October 1997 issue of the National Catholic Register: ""I am convinced that the Church's canonical system for assessing marriages is theologically sound, juridically coherent, and pastorally effective. It deserves better than it received in Kennedy's book.""I cannot speak/write the language of a canon lawyer. Yet, 12 years later, it is well worth noting that the Roman Rota apparently agreed with Sheila Rauch-Kennedy, with regard to the declaration of nullity (of her marriage to Joseph Kennedy III), being itself invalid!Since first reading Rauch-Kennedy's book, I have become an avid follower of JP II's & Benedict XVI's annual addresses to the Roman Rota. Again I am no canon lawyer. However, it certainly appears that the Holy Fathers have had serious concerns about the operations of tribunals in the past few decades."
3,"important topic, not too well written","Exposing hypocrisy on the part of the powerful is always important. If the facts in this book are true, the Catholic Church, which considers marriage sacred and presumably disapproves of lying, is promulgating dishonesty on a large scale.The book could have been much better organized. While I respect the author's refusal to discuss what went wrong in her marriage and also her refusal to denigrate her ex-husband, the book might have been more effective if it were a bit more personal."
2,Inadequate presentation of a misunderstod process.,"As a professional canon lawyer with a long-standing mistrust of anything marked ""Kennedy"", I wanted to like this book. But ultimately I could not, and instead I ended up resenting its superficial analysis and coffee-clatch style of story-sharing. I did a full-length review of the book in ""National Catholic Register"" 12-18 October 1997, p. 6."
1,A biased look at Annulment,"As the daughter of an annuled marriage, I would find this book to be laughable in its manipulation of facts if it didn't concern a subject this serious. This book is just another example of how Catholicism is willfully misunderstood in culture today. The author stresses the fact that she is fighting the annulment primarily for the sake of her children. Having experienced annulment from a child's perspective, it is obvious that absolutely none of her concerns for her sons are valid, leaving the reader to wonder about her motives for writing this spiteful book. An annulment is not an indulgence, nor is it something that exists to raise money for the Church (my mother paid only $30 for hers); it exists to minister to those in need. The Church cannot and must not be held accountable for those who may misuse it. And from the glimpses into the personality of the author, it does not appear that even a Kennedy is abusing the annulment in this case."
4,Very Interesting,"I liked the use of anecdotes and the thorough detail about the behind-the-scenes conversations at the tribunal and the legal process. I thought the logical and philosophical arguments were sound. It was a bit longer a story than it needed to be. I did not like the ending in that she did not reveal the outcome of the appeal to the Rota. (Does anyone know?) The book is very candid and emotionally appealing. It makes a fair distinction between marriages which could be annulled (short-term, no children) and those which should not be, such as her own. Overall it is an engaging personal story that is buttressed with strong arguments that you may or may not choose to accept."
5,Exposes the Sham of Annulment,"Ms. Kennedy's book is a detailed and accurate account of the sham of marriage ""nullification"" within the Roman Catholic Church. Her experience has been like thousands of Catholics who have been victims of institutional chicanary. The act of calling marriages ""invalid"", especially when they have produced children,is reprehensible. After reading this book, I am convinced that annulment is nothing more than a modern day form of selling indulgences. The Church charges hefty sums in money and emotional toll to give its blessing to remarriages."
3,NEAT PRINTER,"THIS PRINTER IS FAST AND SHARP!BUT USES ONLY ONE CARTIAGE- I NEEDED TO KNOW THAT FACT AND I DIDN'T. SOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHEN THE BLACK IS GONE- THE ""VOICE"" TELLS YOU FOR 2 MONTHS YOU ARE ""ABOUT TO BE OUT OF INK"" IF ITS ""OUT OF INK"" HOW COME I'M USING IT FOR 2 MORE MONTHS? YES I KNOW THE OTHER COLORS ARE ""MAKING "" BLACK BUT ITS MADDENING"
3,Lexmark 600 series printer,"I am satisfied with this simple-to-use printer. My only complaint is that the printer did not come with both a tri-color and a black print cartridge--the black cartridge was missing. That was quite inconvenient, since the 600 series is no longer in production nor in stores. That makes the #16 cartridge extremely hard to find.GM"
4,"Cheap, but average printer. Good for students.",I have sold quite a few of these printers. They are cheap not bad for the price.
2,Porter-Cable 100 grit snadpaper,"This product use to be made by 3M but the one which I received was made in China and the quality of it was much thinner.Not as good as 3M, and can't be used for the usual 100 grit paper can be, but will be used otherwise..However the service in ordering and receiving the order was excellent."
1,cheap POS but i still use it for now,cheap16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 more words required
1,not happy,not happy at all--zjpper does not work- i would not reccomend this product or company to anyone--i hope i can find the invoice that was with it so i can contact the company--i hope they will replace it with one that works
3,Good for the Price,"The description for this bag was quite accurate. It's a nylon bag that would probably hold approximately 2 maybe 3 (thin) suits. There is no fancy clip or anything at the top to hold the hangers in place, which makes the loop at the top rather useless (seeing as you really need to hold your suit by the hanger).If you're looking for something cheap to cover a suit during travel (like I was), this will work out well for you. It's one of those 'you get what you pay for' items, but it keeps my suit clean on buses, trains, and planes, and that's all that is important to me."
4,Practical,"I use this every week to carry my shirts, jackets and ties to a TV taping session. It does the job."
5,An Exciting Read,"Although new to Sci-fi, I have studied human brain-power and its relationship to creativity. Dean Warren offers the reader a great story plus an even greater insight into how the brain works. Warren's hero, Tol, meets with many situations, each of which helps to explain the brain's intricate functions. Tol displays the mark of a born leader as he employs his tremendously logical brain in deadly combat with its silicone counterpart.I recommend this book. It may, or may not, foretell human life in the year 3300, even so, it tells me that I have been missing something. I'm becoming a sci-fi fan!"
5,Sanding Belt,"Fast delivery, reasonable cost. With the cost of fuel these days being able to procure supplies via the internet is becoming more and more essential. The 3M 50 Grit belt is good for general construction purposes, sanding edges of plywood and such."
2,Overpriced and no better,"$6 per belt w/ shipping! That's four times what I now pay, and these do not last any longer than any other aluminum oxide belt. They do track very well on my Bosch sander."
1,This is not a book!!!,"I had expected to receive a soft cover, spiral bound edition of Nachalo 2. Instead, I received a spiral bound set of CDs to accompany volume 2."
4,Norton Anti Virus for Windows,"Product is a standard in the industry. Performs as expected. Only problem with this version was updating it with a dial-up line which took one hour. That can be a long time. The file scans which should be done on a routine basis also take about an hour, which can also be a long time."
2,Auto-protect drags system a crawl,"When Auto-protect is running, I can not get Outlook to load up email in less than 10 minutes. When Auto-protect is turned off, it takes seconds. I have talked to other people who do not see this behavior and would love to know what the difference is between their system and mine that causes this. In the mean time, I turn off Auto-protect whenever I need to read email."
1,How far Norton has fallen,"I remember the days when Norton Utilities and Norton Antivirus were THE tools to have. Now? Forget it, unless you want your computer to slow to a crawl, your Internet experience slower than molasses in January, and constant reminders that ""your subscription has expired"" even though it's new and is most definitely not expired. Add to that the problems downloading upgrades, where NAV was blocking itself!No more.I'm done with Norton. Thanks, Symantec. You used to have decent products too."
1,AntiVirus that acts like a virus,"I had to uninstall Norton 2007 because it slowed down my computer so much that I thought I had a virus. In other words, the programmers managed to write code that acts like a virus. Actually pretty funny if it would not be so annoying. I want my money back."
1,Norton Customer Support is Chinese torture,"While installing Norton Antivirus 2007 XP, a Norton message flashed that I must delete Webroot for MSN. I did it, and it resulted in crashing the session.Tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait. Then ried the online chat. The wait went on for 9hrs, started #245 in the queue and by now in lline at #59 I realized this was not the Norton I'd used for so many years, I ordered Kapersky anti-virus."
1,Avoid Norton.,"It was a happy day when I finally uninstalled Norton 2007. Instantly, my computer came back to life. I've had six months of nothing but slow start-ups, endless load times, and programs that either quit on their own or wouldn't quit when I wanted them to. Enough! I dumped them. And I used to be a happy Norton customer. But no more. Do yourself a big favor and avoid this one. If you're looking for some good anti-virus software I recommend AVG. But Norton doesn't deserve your business. All they deserve is a kick in the pants."
1,This product is garbage!,"I have been a loyal customer as many others have reported. I am also a software engineer and know computers and their software inside and out. NAV 2006 was okay, but 2007 has yet to work on my system. I have emailed their tech support with extreme detail (from one programmer to another) and continue to get back canned responses telling me to do what I just told them I did. They don't read the customer emails, they certainly don't listen to the customer on the phone, and even a highly technical expert can't get this piece of garbage to work. Everyone should avoid buying this software on principal to send a BIG message to Symantec about customer service and their software products. They take our money, yet charge you to fix their bugs, and still can't get it working. It's just not right, and frankly should be illegal."
1,Norton Is Arrogant,"I have been a loyal Norton product user for years. But this year's product insults my intelligence. It would require me to uninstall my ZoneAlarm software (which is a firewall and only a firewall) before it will install. But nowhere on the box does it say that is a requirement. The manual inside the box says you have to remove other anti-virus software, which has been a requirement for years and sounds reasonable to me. However, only after you open the box and the CD envelope and start to install Norton AntiVirus 2007, do you discover the requirement to remove ZoneAlarm.That is arrogance by the corporation. Do they then expect me to buy their firewall? I would much rather buy ZoneAlarm's Antivirus software and be done with it. Don't buy this product and send a message to software vendors that the intelligence of customers needs to be respected. If your product doesn't work with another, let me know up front so I can make an intelligent buying decision."
1,Long time Norton customer,I've been using Norton Antivirus for years. It's always done a great job. I just installed the 2007 version. AAAAHHHHH! The browser is so slow it's not usable. Never again! Now I need to find a product I can trust again. Just my opinion but you may find it helpful.
5,Norton Products are the best!,"We have owned 14 PC's and now a MAC. In the last 10 years, we have never had a problem with Norton products. I recommend them to anyone who wants ease of use and excellent customer service.Some of the problems people in these reviews are complaining about things that either can be easily fixed or has something to do with their conflict of another program.Obviously, you do not run two simultaneous virus programs. Unistall any other previous versions of any Anti-Virus programs. Then install your new one.The bottom line, before you read hothead reviews, do a little research. I am a 10 year user of Norton with no problems.[...]."
4,Norton Anti-Virus 2007,Product was easy to install once I removed the 30-day trial of Norton Internet Security. So far...so good.
1,snare and delusion,"Be very careful of Symantec. Their product packaging says it applies to a certain operating system, but in reality it doesn't and you can't get it upgraded to apply unless you buy ""another"" package, so why pay twice? Don't trust the Symantec packaging. I spent 5 hours on the phone tonight with: tech support, who then determined it was a customer support issue, and then, surprise, customer support sent me back to tech support, who then (are you as tired yet as I was) sent me to customer support, who gave me a phone number to call that, slightly over an hour later (I wanted to see how long it took), was answered, and who knows if they are gonna help me, I gotta send in a bunch of paperwork. How do I know why their software that says it works on this operating system doesn't work?"
1,"BLOATED resource hog, near impossible to uninstall everything","Just like my title says, Symantec is the most awful AV software around. You'd think with all their R&D; they would have automatic updates set to more than once a week by default, and actually fix the problems their software has had for the last ten years.NOD32 blows this out of the water, uses no noticeable resources, and scans 300GB of data in eight minutes. It also updates continually and has a far greater ability to spot patterns of malicious code that are not in virii definitions yet compared to Symantec.Sorry Norton, you're more useless than anyone can imagine."
1,Going Downhill,"I've been a loyal Norton Antivirus user for years, and consider myself pretty computer savvy, so I'm not usually put off by a minor problem or two. I put up with Antivirus 2006, which was really kludgy and had a terrible user interface. But Symantec has hit rock bottom with Antivirus 2007. Startup is abominably slow. ccApp won't properly close down. ccSvchost blows up at Windows shutdown. This product has been steadily going downhill as it gets bigger, and bigger, and ... I even removed the product and reinstalled, but to no avail. After reading other reviews, the last thing I want to do is speak to a service rep with a prepared script, except to demand my money back."
1,One star is too many...,This is the last Symantec product I will ever buy. I just tried to install this and it told me I would have to uninstall ZoneAlarm Pro. Frack them! I love the ZoneAlarm Pro and have been using it for years. I upgraded to the 3 user version to put all the household computers on the same plan. What a mistake. Upgrading another (non ZoneAlarm) computer took 3 hours (several re-installs) because the Symantec upgrade script can't clean-up the registry correctly when a user changes the drive the software gets installed to. What a lame mistake. And this is not the first time I have had problems with Symantic installs.But this last issue is the worst. There was no warning on the package that I would have to abandon my favorite program in order to fit into their world. They exhibit a toxic mix of arrogance and incompetence. I am sick of them.
1,Disgusting...Shame on Symantec!,"If you have ZoneAlarm firewall installed, you CANNOT install Norton AntiVirus 2007. Like many other people, I feel ZoneAlarm is a superior firewall program and I will not uninstall it just to upgrade to NAV2007.The sad thing is that Symantec does not inform you of this before you have already started the installation. Nowhere on their packaging...nowhere on their website...nowhere in the downloadable pdf manual.This is totally unacceptable. Symantec has finally succeeded in driving away many computer users who have been loyal to Norton AntiVirus of the past."
1,Don't buy it!,"I own a computer repair business, and I get a kick out of scanning virus-infected computers that have Norton Anti-virus/Internet Security on it. If you think the program is doing its job, and finding all of the bad stuff, think again! It doesn't find a tenth of the stuff on your computer, and is also a resource hog (much like its Internet Security cousin) that slows down some computers to the brink of crashing. Don't waste your money! There are free programs that can find a lot more stuff than this junk can."
1,Norton AntiVirus,"This was one of the worst software programs that I have ever tried to install on my computer. The install was very difficult, the updating module loaded incorrectly. I spent over 6 hours hanging on the phone on three occasions waiting for a service agent to assist me.I finally had to have a agents help to uninstall the program, and I returned the program to Amazon for a refund.Almost any of the free antivirus programs are a better choice."
1,I decided to uninstall Norton...,"Just last night, I decided to uninstall norton, as it was causing my Dell 8200 to freeze up. Heck I notice dell does not even use norton anti virus for there newer computers they sell now, there using the McAee Anti virus software. So Im finish with Norton, I've been a Norton user for many years, now I going for a change, as of now Im running no anti virus software, but I plan to buy some other kind in the upcoming days. I notice my PC boots faster now that Norton is off, and programs load faster :D"
3,Nice program But is no improvement over 2006,"Nis 2007 offers good antivirus protection,but has compatibility issues with Zone Alarm,Spysweeper Spybot Search And Destroy and most games you like to play.This means Nis 2007 takes the fun out of the internet,by slowing everything down.Norton wants to be the only game in town.Your Move!!!!"
1,Creates more problems than it solves,"I just want to say as someone who grew up on Symantec products, and who has spent years trying to set Norton up to work with my system, I am done, I am out. No mas. And it feels soooo good. Like pulling a multi-tentacled parasite out of my brain good.This is simply a product that got away from itself and worms its way into every crevice of your computer and creates many problems in the name of security.Quicken could not communicate with my banks, I spent hours on the phone trying to resolve it, never did. Couldn't use quicken for years. I can now. I always had an alert from Norton on my desktop because I turned off one small part of its security. If I had a big virus problem I would be none the wiser.AVS free anti-virus is the way to go. Avoid Norton at all costs."
4,Don't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until after your current subscription runs out!,"I have used Synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them. However, don't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until AFTER your current subscription runs out because Synmatec will not give you credit for the un-used portion of your previous subscription. I asked and they said ""no way"". That aspect of ""customer service"" is very disappointing."
1,WARNING!! Will not install after removing Norton 06 Internet Security,"WARNING!! This was the worst experience ever have upgrading software from the same co. I have Norton Ghost, Partition Magic, and 06 Internet Security on my laptop. After instructed to remove 06 IS, I installed the 07 Antivirus. After finish, I kept getting a pop-up Runtime Error msg and the produce will not work. I went to the support site and follow the instructions to use their Autofix tool to completely remove all of 06 IS and LiveUpdate. I did so and reinstalled the Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I went back to the support site and was told to remove the old IS and upgrade to a new LiveUpdate first. I did so and reinstalled Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I called support and waited 30 mins. Finally was told I needed to pay $29 fee for live help. I returned the product and vow to never buy from Symantec again. I purchased CA Internet Security and installed without any problem."
1,Imagine everything that 2006 was and NAV 2007 has more bloat to spare!!,"I am so disgusted with NAV 2007. I do not advise anyone to waste their money on this bloated product.I installed it 3 days ago and I wished I had followed my gut feeling to not buy NAV anymore. I have been a faithful NAV customer since 2001, but that will change when this version expires, or I decide to chuck it and the money I invested in it, sooner.This 2007 version has slowed my computer down so much, it is appauling. My computer crashes and I have to reboot to be able to search the web. My computer is new.DON'T waste your money, I reccommend a free antivirus(AVAST or AVG) over this crap."
4,No problems with intstallation,Purchased this as part of a tax software deal. Almost did not install due to problems listed on this site. After 3 month subscription to 2006 expired went ahead with 2007 install. No major problems. One minor glitch was that preinstallation scan inexplicably aborted. Parental controls not as good as cyber patrol.
4,Excellent Tool!!,This product helps to protect and safeguard my computer from unwanted attempts at hacking into my system. A must have for the mobile professional.
4,"Decent, but not as good as the old NAV","This is a decent version of Symantec's Norton Antivirus line. It did slow my XP system down at first, but has run well on my laptop's Vista system. I got it to work well with XP by disabling some of the alerts and reducing the threat levels to medium. Thus said, it's reliable and it has done a good job of blocking two threats.However, my only drawback is that you have to pay extra to get a multiple user version whereas the old days it would install on all my computers without having to purchase extra licenses. In that respect it's a ripoff. Also, I think from reading other reviews that the older Norton versions prior to 2005 were much better and I will admit that I dread each new version that comes out.Thus, I would suggest buying a slightly older version and just pay for the renewal instead of going out and buying the latest version every year."
1,Forget it,"Would not install correctly or completely. After four or five tries online with their live technical support (which - incidentally - is in another country and dropped off in the middle of three of my sessions) and several hours of poor troubleshooting, my last technical ""expert"" basically told me go through the same troubleshooting techniques I had done prior to ever contacting online support. Awful. Forget the trouble and just buy Zone Alarm's Internet Security suite. Works like a charm and no compatibility issues."
2,You're better off with something else...,"My experience with the last several versions of Norton AntiVirus is that they really slow your system down. Norton AntiVirus is becoming bloatware. It hogs your system's resources and slow down your entire computing experience.You'd be better off getting AVG Anti-Virus from GriSoft. It's a superior product, cheaper, more reliable, and a lot less of a system resource hog."
1,"problems, problems","Continual problems with this software, it keeps switching itself off and won't let me switch it back on, instead it decides to run the liveupdate. If I wanted it to run liveupdate I'd click on that, when I ""turn on"" autoupdate it would be nice if it did it. Sigh ... nope, had enough of Norton, it's coming off my PC and I'm going with a different anti virus software provider. I won't be buying Norton again. Ever."
1,DO NOT INSTALL THIS SOFTWARE ON YOUR PC~!,"All Symantec wants you to do is bait you into installing their crappy software (which you won't EVER be able to uninstall). They will give you a 15-day trial, and then try to rip you off $40 bucks at the end of the trial period. It will shamelessly destroy your Windows Installer baseline package in the name of security while hideously removing the ability to install or uninstall any application including NAV.DO NOT INSTALL THIS SOFTWARE unless you are looking forwarding to formatting your c:, got it?"
1,STAY AWAY from Symantec...PERIOD!!,"I cannot stress enough how bad Symantec is!! This is by far one of the WORST software companies that exists today. The poorest customer service, and if you REALLY want a reason to go postal, try finding your way around their website.ALSO!! Symantec is far from the best at catching viruses. There are much better products out from McAfee, Trend Micro, and Sophos. Go find them and don't waste your time here any longer!"
2,Wouldn't Buy Again,"I've a Norton user for many years. I 'upgraded?' from NAV 2005. This product was a pain to install. I had to uninstall Zone Alarm, which isn't noted anywhere. I've never had to do that before. The installation process required rebooting multiple times. In the past it had been an easy process. Not anymore! I will not buy Norton in the future."
2,Norton AntiVirus 2007 (Old Version),"1. I did not know this was the old version when I purchased the software.2. I made my purchase in September 2007. The software key was previously registered on April 30, 2007 so I could not register the subscription and it expires in April 2008, not September.3. I requested that the product be replaced with an unregistered product, which did not happen. Amazon did give me a full refund for the product."
2,Product OK - be prepared to spend $30 per tyear to keep current.,This is an ok product. But note that the subscription to keep the virus defininiton up to date will cost you about $30.00 per year. Just be aware. You can't suppress the message if you choose not to upgrade. I won't upgrade just for this reason and the cost is not reasonable for me.
2,Renewing NAV-2005 AGAIN -- Norton has fallen FAR,"Funny thing: I saw TONS of the SAME CRAPPY REVIEWS FOR NAV-2006 a year ago, chose the slightly-more-expensive path of renewing NAV-2005 back then ... and have had two happy computers all year.Since those PCs both get replaced next year, easiest thing for me is to re-renew NAV'05!"
2,Do NOT buy,"I bought this b/c I got the 2006 version as a gift & I needed to upgrade. I had to not only uninstall Anti-virus 2006, I also had to unintstall the internet security! Internet security was still up-to-date but to install the 2007 anti-virus I had to take it off my computer.What kind of company makes you take off their own products b/c one version is not compatible w/another?Also the customer service is a nightmare. The email responses are not helpful, they take no responsibilty for product problems & you cannot get a human being in customer service. You'd think they were part of HP for all the problems you get trying to get helpDO NOT BUY"
1,Do not buy this,"I am outraged. After buying this product (full retail box), only during instalation do I discover that it is not compatible with the ZoneAlarm firewall; the 2006 Norton version did not have this limitation -- meaning Norton deliberately added it in to force users to buy the Norton firewall product. It's unconscionable to make your software incompatible with your competitor's products in other areas. It's an outrageous business practice, and a ripoff. I will never buy another Norton product again. They should be ashamed."
5,"As a parent I've heard it a hundred times, and I don't mind!","As a parent of two small children, anytime I can get them to listen to something suitable is a big bonus. This album is complex, dealing with subjects from love of parents to eating strange foods. The messages presented are positive, fun and musically diverse. Which explains why I don't mind hearing it over and over again!"
5,Good Quality,"Good quality, sturdy product. Be careful when mounting brackets to be sure that it covers one of the supports, not just the mesh portion. Easly holds a couple of chain saws and all the rigging supplies I use for logging. Only negative is that it blocks the rear compartment at the back of the ATV, and can restrict turn radius with some hitch attached items that may run into corners of basket."
5,Swisher Basket,Basket works out great. We do a lot of trapping and hunting so the basket is ideal to carry what we need to hunt with. I would buy from this seller again.
5,Great Carolling Songbook,"This is a perfectly sized songbook for your Christmas feast. Words, music and history of all your favorites and quite reasonably priced. I now own 24 copies of this book. One can place them on the guest's chair or under the dinner plate. This book is just the right size: both compact and readable. We had a 3-hour Christmas Feast centered around the theme of gratitude and we sang throughout the meal. It's amazing how many ""non-singing"" folks will join in when the words and music are right in front of them. Warm up your next holiday event and sing your hearts out. It feels great!"
4,You Could Go Caroling With This Book,"It's hard to imagine improving on Christmas Carols, but this book not only provides harmonic carols, it also provides information about each one."
1,"If there is a god, please save us from this man.","You can see most of this maniacs footage on Youtube, but you have GOT to see it one way or another. Creationism is about as dependable a science as 16th centurt alchemy. Rubbish."
2,It is not NEW!,"I chose this book because it was rated as NEW. On the contrary it is used, many exercises are scribbled in pen and pencil. I'm disappointed by the seller (sposato). Thanks."
4,Coolest Surfing game Ever!!,"Championship Surfer rocks! there's nothing this cool for quick bouts on the PC that you can have a quick game or two at lunch or before dinner. It takes me back to my last Holiday in Hawaii years ago when I met a young lady who had the biggest... anyway, you get the point. There's Championship mode (gah!) and Arcade mode where you have to avoid nuclear waste barrels, killer sharks and those A-holes on jet-skis. It's about the only game that I liked more than Tony Hawk 2 on the PC (I'm a surfer from way back but I broke my ankle skating, the worst thing to happen to me while surfing was getting covered in s**t. That don't happen at home most days. I loved this game as a way to do something other than frag my buddies on-line. The only thing missing is network play. Other than, if you got a PC and surf, get this one"
4,one of the best ever,"What a blast! Great graphics and easy gameplay. Some improvements can be made if another edition comes out like actual beaches and a larger numbers of surfers to chose from. Also it would be nice to be able to create a surfer of your own. But enough of that. If you surf or ever wanted to, this is a must game.Totally addicting!! The makers have totally created the physical dynamics of a suefer.Wipeouts are realistic, and the smooth motion is better than anything i've played. Oh well get this game you won't be sorry!!!"
5,A great guide!,"Bensen offers a wonderful guide to the Pony Express enthusiast. Paralleling the original trail and stations, the Guide gives an east-to-west account for finding the (Pony and non-Pony) sites, museums, and curiosities along the historical trail. Bensen has been particularly thorough in reporting where sites of interest are on private property. I found this book to have many helpful features including an accurate assessment of whether or not an obscure site was worth getting to, what types of vehicles--from all-terrain to RV's--are appropriate for particular stretches of the route, alternate routes for those pressed for time, and great Pony By-ways. This guide also includes interesting historical anecdotes inserted at appropriate intervals to the surrounding text. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to follow the trail of the Pony Express."
2,Not worth it,"I'm currently a student enrolled in a class that is using this book. I bought it over the summer to prepare for the course and found it very confusing. The book is very illogical and not well written at all. The writers seem to try to find the most complicated way to express even the simplest idea. For example Newton's first law of motion is stated as ""An object at rest and an object in motion maintains its velocity unless it experiences an unbalanced force."" How much wordier can it get?The entire textbook is this way and jumps from one subject to another with almost no logical order. I would strongly suggest that anyone thinking of buying this book reconsider. There are many superior books out there than this one."
1,BAD,"I am a student and I do not find this book helpful to me at all. All this book does is confuse me and with this I believe that I speak for the whole class including the teacher. This book changes from one subject to the other randomly and insufficiently explains the topic, It tries to cover the lack of info with the pictures. We have even found grammatical errors."
3,Not complete,Is there a textbook where I can find the answers to the questions in the workbook? I need to have something for my children to read before they can answer these questions. Am I missing something?
5,This book is life changing!,"The Running Prophet is an incredible story. It deals with those who are going through rough times, and reminds us of the one we can always turn to, God. For anyone who is looking for something new in your life, read the Running Prophet, your life will change for the better!"
5,A Huge Success!!,"The recipes, ingredient lists and photos of the food look delicious! I know from past experience that Southern Living recipes are the best. A special feature of this book is the ""Test Kitchens' Top 10 Gadget Gifts"" section, which is so nice. For each gadget, there is a recipe and they all look great. The gift wrapping section in this edition is longer than in other CWSL's, and I LOVE it. The home decorations are GORGEOUS!!! I was in awe as I turned the pages. The table settings are lovely and this edition features a ""Tips for Table Settings"" page that is very useful. I am definitely pleased with this purchase!"
5,"Experience, logic, and feelings for turbulent times","This book tells how one individual seeks a meaning to Life and finds it. He is not just narrating his personal experience, but also giving the reader years of true scholarly work and deep understanding of Islam. This book tells a familiar story but with a happy ending that is still going on. It tells of the journey of an individual through the craziness of the world. Dr. Lang found his safe harbor in a turbulent time. His journey while deeply personal can be taken by anyone and he draws the map for all. Dr. Lang's understanding of Islam is truly amazing."
4,Keaggy's set is classic,"I'm not a fan of 2nd Chapter of Acts, but Phil Keaggy's set on this album ranks up there with its contemporary Frampton Comes Alive for live rock improv married to catchy songs. A lot of the Glass Harp spirit shines through in Phil's performance, and ""A Band called David"" does a fine job keeping up with him. Standout tracks include Time, Rejoice, Just the Same, and a nice version of Your Love Broke Through."
3,I only bought this because the late Dottie West was in the film,"Not A bad movie, bought the VHS version back in the 90's. The late country star Dottie West has a featured role in the film. Dottie's not in it very much, but makes good with the little screen time she's given. It's not a bad little movie, but some of the special effects are kinda hokey. I only recommend this if you are a fan of any of the stars of this film. As a Dottie West fan, I had to have this DVD."
2,To much of the original full movie is missing on this DVD,"I viewed this movie on Cinamax when it was free with your cable account when cable first came, it seems to me after purchasing this DVD a lot has been cut from this DVD, the main story remains but there are missing scenes, likely lost scenes from degression sitting collecting dust in heat of summer or cold of winter, where ever it was stored, what does remain is very much worth a viewing, it is spiritual though not religious..."
3,Laura Ingals meets childish alien,Based on real events slightly. I thought the movie would be a little more mysterious like an 80s sci-fi movie but it played out more like an after school special. Id watch it again for laughs but it was worth watching and would be interesting and fun to watch at 11 years old. Buy it for a sleepover.
2,a little hokey,"Almost a sub ""B"" movie. If I didn't like scifi so much, I would probably give it a one star. It's difficult to try to judge a movie on the character based on the time and electronic wizardary available when the movie was made. The acting is stilted and a little stale. If you think of this movie as a re-enactment of supposed events, it's tolerable."
2,Boring!,"The only good parts of this film are the title credits and the final shot of the movie. The special effects are no longer special, the acting bad, the dialogue corny, and the action scenes terrible. For a good Tobe Hooper film, check out Salem's Lot instead. For real sci-fi/horror, check John Carpenter's The Thing instead."
1,ugh,"This is terribly awful. I didn't like the original, and this was about 20 times worse. It contained senseless cursing from a ""all american family"" and a terrible child actor to saying it. It's like they took the corniness of the first and thought, ""Hey, this needs to be even MORE cornier!"". The special effects were better, but not good, even for the 80's. I did appreciate how they gave the big brain thingy more of a part, because I felt in the first one, he wasn't around enough. Yeah, there's no reason you should ever watch this."
4,Fun Cheese,"I really liked this flick, despite the cruddy ending. It's a really good excuse to stop doing...stuff that I can't explain right now. The F/X are really cool, and the storyline is good to."
3,It's no Hamlet -- but it's good for what it is!,"Look, the whole point of this is that it's a B-movie! And it is a good B-movie. Admitedly I'm biased because it was filmed, in part, at the elementary school I attended, but I liked it even before I found out about it. What it comes down to is that if you like somewhat corny science fiction but also appreciate at least a fairly serious attempt at a realistic presentation, you should like this film. If not, go watch something else. This movie doesn't try to be Star Wars, don't expect to be one!By the way, I happen to prefer a slightly different style of movie now, so I can't give it more than a 3. That doesn't mean it isn't worth watching! You just might want to rent. ^_~"
1,Jimmy Hunt plays a Police Chief in a few scenes.,"You've seen the 1953 version,Invaders from Mars (Special Edition), now see the even wierder and much longer 1986 version with an all-star cast: Karen Black, Timothy Bottoms, Laraine Newman, James Karen. Bud Cort and Louise Fletcher. This one is far-fetched too, but it might make you like the original instead. The boy is played by Karen Black's real son, Hunter Carson.The boy from the original 1953 film, Jimmy Hunt, plays a Police Chief in this one. He is the one on the right."
2,Terrible!,"Tobe Hooper had a number of screen successes and then directed this??? What was he thinking? The movie alternates between kitschy-camp and parody. If this film is supposed to be a send-up of the original, it failed miserably. Conversely, if this was supposed to be a hip, insider's sci-fi flick, it seems so very self-conscious and phony. At least ""Mars Attacks!"" never took itself seriously. A marvelous cast (Timothy Bottoms, Louise Fletcher, Larraine Newman, to name a few) is completely wasted in what undoubtedly will become a Worst Movie of All Time award recipient."
1,Extremelyl awful,"I've never really liked Tobe Hooper. His Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist struck me as quite overrated (especially the latter). As a matter of fact, my favorite film of his is Lifeforce (which is not a great film by any means), probably due mostly to the presence of Mathilda May.Anyway, Invaders from Mars came out after Lifeforce and it's nowhere as entertaining, tense, or fun as that sci-fi flick was. Instead, Invaders was just dull and stupid. The solutions for fighting the aliens is nothing creative, just straightforward shootings, and the cast is full of terrible actors. And I thought TCM and Poltergeist were pretty bad."
3,Make sure you get the correct DVD with the extras,"There seems to be two versions of this film on DVD, the one I purchsed has ""Midnight Movies"" printed at the top of the DVD case, and even though there does not seem to be any mention anywhere, apart from the Trailer, there are two featurettes on the DVD. Unlike a lot of featurettes which are filmed for DVD now with photos from the time the film was made, the two on this DVD were made at the same time as the movie. They are 8 minutes, and 15 minutes in length, contain interviews with the main cast, as well a great look behind the scenes at shots in the movie as they are being filmed. There are also interviews with some of the crew, and a look at the production props, and special effects.It's worth buying this version of the DVD for the extras, and the opening titles are still amongst the most exciting I have ever seen.I nearly gave it 4 stars by the way"
3,BETTER THAN YOU THINK,"With little fanfare, MGM has quietly transferred a handful of great B films to DVD that they not too arbitrarily categorize as ""Midnight Movies."" The nice looking digital prints are in their original theatrical format and appear as if they were taken from original material. The discs come with no substantial extras but care has been lavished on the box art, often reflecting the lurid lobby cards and posters of their initial release. Even acknowledging the B category, these are for the most part well-crafted and, well, adequately acted.In ""INVADERS FROM MARS"" Tobe Hooper directs a terrific cast -- Karen Black, Timothy Bottoms, Bud Cort and Louise Fletcher -- in a straightforward update of the of the 1953 cult classic. This flip side to the benign aliens of ""E.T."" or ""Close Encounters"" delivers bad guys from space who not only want our planet but our souls as well. Creepy fun that can still raise the hair on your neck."
5,GREAT BOOK,Part of a great series of books. Keeps you interested and makes you become part of the charachters history. Worth purchasing.
3,Not good for burning CDs,I have buffer underrun protection on my CD burner yet this product fails with underrun errors every time.
4,Big Ugly Martian Runs Amok on Space Ship!,"Do you ever yearn for the days when the Million Dollar Movie would scare the bejesses out of you? Well, turn down the lights, get your popcorn and Bosco, and watch this classic from the 50s.A rescue mission to Mars is bringing back the sole survivor to stand trial for killing his commrades in order to survive. Unfortunately, they bring something else back too - one big ugly nasty creature intent on sucking every drop of moisture out of the unsuspecting crew. As the plot unfolds, they try everything to kill this thing off, but to no avail. A thrilling climax tops it all off.This film is pure 1950s, and [many suggest] was the model for the film, Alien, because of the many similarities (including the infamous ""C"" deck and air duct fiasco). Although dated, it's great fun - a must see for all affectionados!Bax"
4,The first manned expedition to Mars,"The first manned space ship crashes on Mars. A recovery ship is sent 10 years later to find Col. Edward Carruthers (Marshall Thompson) alive and his fellow crew members dead; it looks like foul play.Now Carruthers is being brought back for a court marshal. Oops someone left the door unlocked. And we all know what that means. Looks like someone will become ""It!"" chow such as Ann Anderson (Shawn Smith)?Notice when the ship is in space they make the same background sounds as The War of the Worlds (1953).Black and white (1958) Jerome Bixby - Well known Writer (screenplay).The last Jerome Bixby written film:The Man from Earth"
2,A shocker,"As a comedy I would give this 4 stars. As an attempt at science fiction I feel I am generous giving it 2 stars. Bad acting, bad sets, bad costumes,bad directing. I know the film was made in the 50's but so were other great films like, ""Quatermass Experiment"", ""It came from outer space"", ""The day the earth stood still"", ""Them"" etc. Give this movie a miss if you like 50's and 60's Sci-fi movies and go for the ones mentioned above. If you want a laugh then buy this as purely comedy."
4,Great Story - Nutty 50's Effects and sets,"Hey, this is, I am told the precursor to Aliens and that whole series of monster movies on spaceship. Well it is a fun story, crazy sets, typical to the 50's, and so dated. It kept making me just a bit crazier than usual and I was glad when the monster grabbed the nut opening the carton of cigarettes. For the Gods sake, even Jules Verne had more sense than that. All those glass bottles and open everythings... Jeeze mareez this ship was a death trap before it got off the ground.But, anyway, the movie is a classic and is really well worth the time to rent first and then decide to buy. It matters because it is absolutely a good story.Just remember it was a really scary movie for its time and damn good one now days. Worth a late night, munch some popcorn and laugh at the sets but still shiver at the concept type movie."
4,Bazookas in space!,"Lots of ""Cheeeeesy"" 50s fun.Unstoppable rubber monsters, helpless women, chain smoking astronauts and the bit that got me the most, rifles, pistols, grenades and a Bazooka in space... Just what every space ship needs!A great fun film, not to be taken to seriously."
3,A Precursor for Alien,"The movie revolves around the first flight to Mars and its deadly ending. The ship crashes and the crew diappears except for the Captain. When the rescue ship arrives, that ship's captain arrests the surviving captain for murder, on the idea that the crew were killed so the captain would survive. The captain claims an alien monster killed the crew but has no evidence.Unknown to all, the monster enters the returning ship and begins to kill the crew, draining them of liquid and oxygen. After several failed attempts, the monster is finally killed by draining all the oxygen from the ship.It's a campy film straight from the 50s. Everyone smokes like chimneys and the lead woman is reduced to serving coffee. The effects are bad and superficial.The story is interesting because it parallels the much later and much better Alien movie. The movie drags in several areas as the crew tries various ways to kill the monster."
4,Gave me nightmares.,"As a kid, I watched an endless stream of sci-fi and horror movies on the Saturday night horror show called ""Creature Feature"" that was on in Omaha. My parents always said I would have nightmares, but this is the only movie that ever caused me to have one. While it's obvious that this film was made on a shoestring budget, the sets do give the movie a dark and claustrophobic feel. You can sense that the crewmembers are trapped, with no place to escape to. Of all the 'creature from outer space' movies that came out in the 1950's, this one is a standout due to the suspenseful script and effective acting."
4,That's where the idea for Alien came from,"This is one of those great 50's b grade sci-fi horror flicks. It has a good cast, build a nice suspenseful plot and is just enjoyable. True, special effects were not high on the budget, but remember this is for fun. It is not Citizen Kane, but it wasn't meant to be. I was not around for the matinee days of the 50's (barely), so my view is from the Saturday morning double creature feature television."
4,It! The Terror from Beyond Space,"This is a fun movie bringing back my early days of innocense when drive-in movies and horror flicks were exciting and real to me. This is a movie I recalled and had to see again. By today's standards it is trite and primitive, but it was surprisingly scary for its time. Maybe because I was only eight years old at the time!"
4,Missing imput?,"It The Terror is a great 50s sci-fi that set the premise for future films. Curiously though, I've read almost all (currently)68 reviews and know one has commented on the aspect ratio of the film. Truthfully I dont know the answer right now either but here goes.Widescreen came out in about 1954. This movie is from 1958. Many 50s monster flicks were released in widescreen. Certainly not all were, but I would have thought the producers would have capatalized on that eras widescreen popularity. The question is: is this dvd the wrong format? There have been many films from this era that were turned into pan and scan even for dvd (definetely laserdisc). If it wasn't shot in widescreen, I'm sure it was all about budget restraints.By all means watch it an appreciate the 50s vibe that set a tone to be remembered. I just want to know, should this be widescreen?"
3,A period realism in terror.,"This film was a milestone in the period. Apart from the archaic props which should be discounted due to the date in which it was made, the use of the language--or better yet--the dialog is very refreshing. You can actually believe that the caracters are interacting without reading from a script.Aside from that, this picture is a must see for all vintage science fiction buffs. It's fast paced, witty, and has a good basis for story line."
2,Disappointed...,"I hate to disagree with the majority here but I was disappointed with this one. It relied too much on the guy in the monster suit rather than trying to build mystery and suspense, which is so important to a low budget sci fi like this one. I found the acting to be sub-par, even for a 50's sci fi. Definatley obvious that this film inspired the now famous Alien, though. If you're looking to build a 50's sci fi section in your video library it would be wise to start with the other 'It' movie, It Came From Outer Space. This one also had a low budget but the acting and suspense make it far superior."
5,Long lasting. Fair Price. Strong ROI,"Put Mirka sanding disks on your random-orbital sander and you won't find yourself changing disks near as often as you did before. The one trick is to keep close and use a rubber sander ""eraser"" regularly. This same strategy with other disks helps, but they still do not stand up to the Mirka disks. Buy a combo box first then decide on what works for you. I tend to use the 80 and 100 most often, but your work and style may dictate something else.One con: Don't use with plastic auto-body filler (BONDO, et al). These will gum up the disk quickly and irreversibly."
4,Atmospheric Groove,"If you are a big fan of the greasy soul-jazz of ""Down Home Style"" (which I consider a four star disc) you may be slightly befuddled by this release. This isn't the greasy jazz that you typically attribute to Mr. McDuff. Moon Rappin' is an atmospheric delight. It almost plays like a concept album with its spacey textures and suttle backing vocals. It sounds like the soundtrack for late 60's interplanetary travel. Complete with wah-wah guitars & flutes...don't pass this up."
1,crap nothing but crap,This was not worth the few dollars as an experiment. I would not waste the time downloading this even. Fail Fail Fail.
2,Dull and dated but do-able,"2 1/2At first the disc is a complete dud, reeking of musty old, lower-level progressive rock. Then on the third track we witness some compositional competency finally that just may point in a positive light. Lo and behold, a certain intelligent melody and rhythm does creep into the latter portion, saving perhaps a mediocre work from being a terrible one."
1,3 stars????!!,"this is the only Amon Duul 2 album that i can't stand with the exception of some of the cds of the UK version(witch is a comptetly diffrent story) of the band. to me it almost sounds glam like, witch isent even good in that respect. i was so disapointed!! as far as i am concerned its the weakest Amon Duul 2 release out there."
2,Amon Duul II - 'Pyragony' (Repertoire) 2 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1976. Sort of thought maybe the band should've changed their name to Amon Duul II Revisited. This isn't the SAME Amon Duul II that was on the lp masterpeices, like 'Phallus Dei', 'Yeti' and 'Tanz Der Lemmings'. It's a so-so progressive effort, at best. The playing is decent, but the writing and song arrangements simply didn't do much for me. I still plan to hang onto my copy, just the same. The better tracks would be ""Flower Of The Orient"" (believe they still might play this tune in their reunion sets these days), the instrumental ""Crystal Hexagram"" and ""Telly Vision"". Pretty much for AD II completists."
1,didn't work at all,"i don't know what the problem was, but this just didn't work for me at all. the S-video connector didn't plug into either of the two TVs i tried, and i ordered directly from amazon and tried exchanging for a replacement that didn't work either. very disappointing."
1,NOT S-VIDEO,"Ordered an S-Video cable, received a composite cable. The item is not at all what is described as for sale."
4,If you need,"A way to get a better than composite video from your GC, get this for your needs. Hard to find."
5,Wonderful renditions of Eric Carle's stories,"My son and I have been enjoying this movie for over a year. We have a wonderful time enjoying it; it even caused us to buy what has become his favorate book, ""Papa Please Get The Moon For Me"", which is included in this video."
1,Disappointing,"I love reading Eric Carle's books to my toddler, but I found this to be very dreary. Everytime I put it on he didn't even glance at it."
5,Excellent video!,"I love this video, and so does my 4-year old daughter. The images are beautiful, as is Eric Carle's artwork in general; the music fits the style and stories well; even the narration of the stories is great. I was actually hoping I would find more of Carle's stories on video for Christmas... I definitely recommend this one to anyone, kids and adults alike. It is really nicely done."
4,They're going to send one up your spine,"True to their name, they're going to send one up your spine with their powerful, high-energy, speed punk sound. Shiver is like The Offspring with balls."
3,Ok But......,The grips were shipped in a timely manner. They are good but they feel like sandpaper. I wonder how my hand will feel after 100 rounds at the range. Time will tell.
4,ONE OF THE BEST GROUPS!!!!!,"The Dubs were one of the best R&B groups of the 50's....Richard Blandon always sang his heart out on their great songs...""Could This Be Magic"", ""Chapel Of Dreams"", ""Such Lovin'""..etc...were the same quality as The Drifters, The Clovers and The Flamingos...The sad part was that they never recorded for a big label that was able to push their music. This cd shows how GOOD these guys really were. It's a must on your shopping list of Classic R&B Groups."
1,Didn't work at all,"Well, this did not work to heal my mild psoriasis at all. MG217 ointment with vitamin E is what cured it. Perhaps this will help to maintain healthy skin after?!? I'll repost and let you know."
5,Psoriaflora,"This product works great. I've suffered from eczema my whole life and recently started getting very bad psoriasis on my lower legs. This has been the second day using it and already my skin is starting to clear. I'm sure it will take a few more days, but I'm amazed. It is the first product that has given me hope"
2,Didn't Work for me,"I have a mild case of psoriasis on my elbows and I've tried a number of products with no much luck. Some things about this product to know, it seemed to make my skin smoother but any lotion will do that for me. It never took away redness and the skin remained the same so it didn't really seem to do much. It does carry an odor to it but that is a minor thing but the ineffectiveness was the main downfall."
2,I Know Something Better...,"Used Psoriaflora for 2-3 years because it made the psoriasis on my knees and elbows not look SO bad, but it sure took a lot of cream. THEN I found this other cream, ""TG217"", that actually ELIMINATED THE PSORIASIS ALTOGETHER!!! Yikes, I've been so happy with that stuff. one month and all the psoriasis that I had, elbows and knees, was gone. I felt that I was turning into an old turtle, crusty with psoriasis. TG217 worked incredible for me. hope it works for you too!! Peace."
3,nothing to write home about.,it's okay. has some historical revelance as it is a memoir of an Afrikaaner.
5,Event horizon,"My voyage of trough Coetzee's books continues as the time progresses, and as I read more and more, I begain to undersatnd all that I failed in earlier readings...and I find myself wondering, how could one write so good, how could one put on paper every thought that troubled me since I'm aware of my existence...This you may call an autobiography, an autobiography which presents a young student, artist-to-be, fleeinf from sout-africa in a land of romantic poets, The england, where he does not find, neither poets nor art...If you ever wondered about your place in modern world, if you ever longed for an ""old times"" this is the book for you...(Oh, I almost forgott - if you don't have an elementary education of romanesque poets, philosophy and general conception of the world, this book will be slightly incomprehensible :)"
5,Everyone loves a good love poem!,"Under this cover all of Ella's sweetest and most sentimental love poems are collected. Not for everyone's taste but if you love a good love poem, you will enjoy this collection immensely."
4,Book bought as a gift - not read,"This book was bought for a friend in Serbia, where very few Christian books are available. I didn't read it before sending it on."
5,"Great product, great price","This is a great product, it is standardized and contains 95% opcs which is as recommended on Dr. Oz. When buying many herbal products, you have to read up on the brands and contents to make sure you get what you are paying for. These are vegetarian capsules, which is a plus. Grape seed offers antioxidant protection in a much stronger concentration than drinking a glass of wine or two a day. I take grape seed because it was recommended to me for women't heart health, and I am getting to the age where I actually care about that :)"
5,Heartwarming and Inspiring!,"A wonderful story with a strong heroine and a man who really earns the title 'hero'. It's a 'can't resist' story that has you rooting for the romance but has a believable thread of faith throughout. Just the thing to put you in the perfect holiday mood, even if it's not December! Can't wait for the sequel!"
1,This cd is a rip-off of good songs.,"You may look at this cd and see a lot of cool songs, but don't be fooled. It is NOT by the original artists but instead by some wanna-be's that ripped off the songs. Whatever you do, don't be tricked by this cd - it's a total jip!"
2,losing bristles,"Their is so many to pick from online so I went the middle of the road. After using the toohbrush several times, I was getting bristles in my mouth. Not very well made."
5,Anointed,"Just starting again 'The Promise' CD (for at least the fifth time consecutive this evening) as we humble ourselves before our Great Saviour and Redeemer -- our Atonement -- on this Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). It was almost certainly during the early fall that The Blessed Saviour was born so we often play this recording during the Fall Feasts of YHVH. Michael Card's 'The Promise' is the very finest 'cantata' on the Advent of The Saviour that I have ever heard and my background in music and history is very extensive -- yes, this recording even surpasses Handel's Messiah (and I do LOVE Handel's Messiah). Not only is there not a bad or evem weak song on 'The Promise' ... every song has a great strength and beauty to it. A modern masterpiece as well as a masterpiece for all time. 'Joseph's Song' still often moves me to tears even after almost 20 years of listening."
1,The WORST Sims Game EVER!!!,"Sure I love the Sims as much as the next girl but this sucks.I reallllllllllllllllllly dont recommend it.It gets boring in 1 hour.I love all the other ones-Unleashed,House Party,Vacation and whatever others but this,its horrible!Unless you love getting bored this game is not for you.I think it was a waste of money.I gave mine to my friend.I waited to get it forever!Now I hate it.I mean sure some parts are awesome and there is tons of new stuff.Like the robot and the grim reaper and the windows and tiles and stuff but the game itself has a poor design.I mean its just boring.My boyfriend and I hate it!"
4,This game is alot different than the other games!,This game is the best of the best Sims games there ever were.There is one thing wrong. I had to get my cousin a birthday present for her birthday. She had all the Sims games exept for one which is this game. All the stores I went to they did not have it. So I went online to [a website]and they did not sell it on the internet. So I went to Amazon.com and they had it. I am also missing this game which I am in great need of it. I have all of them exept for one which is Livin' Large. This is my one concern about this item. Once the Deluxe Edition came out some stores did not carry this item in there stock. So I was very mad at that point.
4,Awsome,It is a fun game but not totally like real life. They can't get cars or do anything out of their property except work and school. They do't get any weekends or anything and they still have to go to school and work everyday. There is some really cool items on it and lots of cool floors and walls. It is fun but I am looking forward to getting The Sims House Party and The Sims Hot Date.
5,This is a cool game!,If you liked the sims this awesome game will more than double your fun. you get tons of new outfits wallpaper flooring and items! You should definitly buy it!
3,Interesting story about marriage,"I have read this book both before and after being married. When I was single I liked the part about the courtship, when I was married, I liked the part about the marriage.Kipling wrote it before he was married. He lamented the loss of male friends, who were ""lost"" to family life. If you read ""Puck of Pook's Hill,"" you will see that he also formed a family -- and it appears a happy one-- later in life.It gives you a pretty good idea of a society that is no more (India during the colonial times) which is also worth looking at."
5,Fantastic product!,"Item came way before scheduled delivery and carefully packaged so item's contents were not compromised by the elements of shipping in the heat, handling, etc. It keeps my naturally black highlighted blonde hair from becoming brassy in between coloring. Smells and feels great when massaged and left on for deep conditioning. Definitely recommend this product and seller!"
2,Doesn't leave hair as silky soft as its color-depositing siblings,"For 15 years, I have used Aveda's Clove conditioner intermittently to rejuvenate my medium brown hair color. It leaves my hair with a beautiful shine and softness. However, I can't use it daily as it the color looks overdone. So, I thought I'd try a non-color depositing version of Aveda's conditioner to use daily, in between the ""Clove"" days. This Blue Malva doesn't fit the bill...just a so-so conditioner. I've found that Back to Basics' line of conditioners are a better alternative."
1,Not recommended,"I bought this device and it failed to work with my standard Dell laptop running Windows XP. After various attempts by the Iomega help line to get it to work (they tried), they admitted it had a problem and told me to wait whilst they shipped a new one. No way did I want risk wasting more time with a similar drive. So I replaced it for a Philips (8x series) and that worked first time. The Philips uses Nero software and they work well togther."
4,Very entertaining and humerous,"Barry takes the reader through what every gamblers dreams of - two months on the road playing at every casino in Nevada. It is not just a day by day, deck by deck summary, but an imaginative tale of his travels across the state of Nevada. It is well worth your time."
2,I hated the author's sense of humor,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, the author's attempts at making witty jokes throughout the novel really grow old. There's a couple on every page, and they're not good. Even the stories he had to write weren't exactly gripping.I much prefer the dated ""Ken Uston on Blackjack"" if you want to read about high-stakes, professional Blackjack play."
1,The Challenge is...figuring out what they're doing,"I own about 40 fitness videos, and this is by far the worst (and most expensive) video I have ever purchased. The production value is terrible, and it is difficult to see what you're supposed to be doing. Frequently throughout the tape, different people are doing completely different things, and the cuing is so terrible that you have no idea what muscles you're supposed to be using. Also, there are a number of times where the excercise changes and the camera is focused on the musicians rather than the instructor. Interested in this video? Don't bother."
2,Nothing Special,This book doesn't really offer anything that you won't get in you mail after you have lived here for about a week. Las Vegas is a town used to having outsiders move here so don't worry about it and just have fun.
1,Mr. Internet says do not purchase!!!!,I have worked on several projects developing E-commerce sites. I am currently in a project management MBA program and purchased this book as alearning tool. The author knows nothing about the Internet. You will not learn anything from this book. If you must spend the money buy a pack of gum for $23.00 and you will get more for your money!!!
4,Great book for hands on learning.,"I teach kindergarten and have found this book to be an excellent resource. It gives step by step instructions, interesting - fun lessons for the children, and helps make learning science concepts fun."
5,AWESOME!!,"I've been seeking a particular song & this was the last cassette possible that I could find anywhere. It was delivered in great condition, safely & in a timely manner."
4,Chocolat DVD,"Item was in good con dition, de livery was timely, and the pack aging was adequate, an overall good ex perience."
4,Excellence Personified,"I shan't attempt an elaboration beyond what is already written. There are few movies in my collection that I would not hesitate to shed. This is not one of them. I love this movie and have owned various releases of it. Now, finally, we have the Blu-Ray version I have waited for. The transfer could have been a little cleaner, but that is probably in the master film. I give it 3.5 stars for that reason. Still, this is the best version we have seen. DTS audio. Subtitles. and good extras. Bravo."
5,A great Valentines Day movie!,"This movie was really very beautiful. The actors were very good, and I must add Johnny Depp was gorgeous in this movie! You should definately check this movie out and make sure you have a lot of choclate on hand, trust me, you'll be craving it mid-way through!"
4,Light Humor and Delicious Fun,"This movie was about bringing out the fun in everyone's life. I enjoyed the subtle hints and jokes here and there. All in all, this was a tasty film to watch but not overly pleasing to the mind and eye. It could have been a little bit better."
5,Godiva anyone?,I love this movie. It really makes you think about how fun life can be. The downside is when you are watching it and realize you don't have any chocolate around. Make sure you have chocolate nearby if your going to watch this movie. It will be a feast for the tongue and the soul!
3,Not My Favorite,"A cute story. It is worth seeing, but I would not recommend buying it. It is funny and touching at times, but not fabulous."
3,Cute but that's about it!,People raved about this movie and I sat there and felt like I missed something. It was a good story line. That acting was okay. Some of the characters weren't really devolped very well. It was disappointing.
1,Trite,A film in which a woman comes to town and tries to tempt Catholic away from observing Lent. Somehow this is supposed to be a positive thing. I don't get it.
2,Chocolat Not,"I had high hopes for this movie, and I think it had potential, but it ended up being a yawner. The only thing I got excited about was the chocolate. The artistry used in filming the chocolate will make your mouth water. If you want to enjoy chocolate with no calories, see this movie; otherwise, skip it."
1,Not worth the two hours of your life.,"Heavy-handed dreck about a woman who brings ""enlightenment"" (through libertine ideas and the metaphor of confections) to the supposedly close-minded rubes of a small French village. I watched it for the scenery, but even that small hope went largely unsatisfied.I suppose it's a wonderful little fable for those who were born in the 60's and got stuck in perpetual adolescence."
5,the sweetest romance ever!,"this movie is wonderful! it has a great story and the actors and actresses played awesome parts. juliet binoche and johnny depp have great chemistry and judi dench makes a stellar performance. the music, setting, plot, and script are superb. this is definitely a movie to own. so sit down, grab your favorite type of chocolate, and watch a great movie!"
5,Scrumptious!!!,"This is not the type of movie I usually like, but I have to say that I was just pulled in by it. It gave me something to smile about, with it's colorful characters, and don't forget the Chocolat!!! Juliette Binoche was the perfect choice for the role of Vianne, and of course Johnny Depp plays his sexy river rat role, to a T. Judy Dench as Armonde, is just the perfect touch as the former wild child growing old...and still wild at heart.If you want to see a movie that leaves you feeling good, see this one!"
5,A Movie Simply to Get Into,"I love chocolate. It's sweet and sensual. The movie details the effects of chocolate and what it does to the townspeople. Vianne, part Latino and part French, moves northward to a village and opens a chocolate shop. She welcomes the battered wife of a local, a elderly diabetic woman who's not afraid to exhibit herself, and a man who tries her chocolate and gets kinky with his wife. She arouses people's suspicions and inhibitions with her creations but she also runs from one place to another not letting go of her mother's ashes. Vianne falls in love with river rat Roux.I loved this movie. It was easy to indulge and relax in as themes of chocolate and passion echo into my mind. Johnny Depp still looks good after ""21 Jump Street""."
4,"A light, touching film.","A far-fetched story is grounded by superior acting and emotion in this charming film. Johnny Depp was surprisingly good in this type of role, and Juliette Binoche makes her big movie debut a great one. I wouldn't reccommend it to wrestling fans, but anyone who can appreciate a sentimental story with light, airy humor will enjoy it!"
2,A Pale Imitation of the Novel,"DO NOT READ THE NOVEL BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE!The movie is a cute little piece, but a pale imitation of the novel. The producer tried to capsule the story on his own terms, and failed.The biggest mistake is replacing the priest with the mayor, as the Advesary of the character played by Juliette Binoche. Ms. Binoche did a fine job in her role, but her role was toned down and so stripped of the mystic and magic of the novel.I realize it is a challenge to capsule a 300 page novel in a two hour film. However, the producer would have done better by sticking more to the original theme of freedom versus tyranny of religion.Let me warn you in even sterner terms. If you read the book, don't see the movie. If you see the movie, don't read the book."
2,Average.,"I don't know how the academy picked this fluff over Almost Famous, the best picture of the year. They are definetly slipping. Years ago they would have never put an average ""date"" movie on their list of nominees. The film starts out interesting and good. It seems mysterious and it's like a disney cartoon only real life. Then you realize it's nothing special and you are dissappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, it just isn't a best picture nominee (neither is Erin Brockovich for that matter)."
2,A little to dull,"Chocolat is too long and dull for 2 hours. I cannot belive this film was nominated for Best Picture. Though the other nominations were well deserved except for Best Score. I usually am a sucker for a film like this, but this film tries too hard to be a good romantic comedy. In my opinion, the only thing that saves this film are the wonderful performances by Judi Dench and Johnny Depp. Depp's performance deserved a oscar nomination. I absolutely flipped when I heard this received a Best Picture nomination, and it's nomination should have gone to Wonder Boys. Overall, I give this 2 stars out of 4, only because of the great performances by Dench and Depp."
2,"Sorry, but it's a Bore-alot","'Chocolat' wants to be a charming, enjoyable, heartfelt experience, sort of like strawberries dipped in melted chocolate. Sadly, it somes off more like a Sneakers Bar. It's about a mysterious woman who blows into town and sets up a chocolate store. The woman, Vianne, is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. So, of course, she is hated by people that art not. There is an intolerant, unhappy mayor who forces the local priest to read his sermons who hates Vianne because she would not listen to one of his sermons. Vianne uses her chocolate confections to fix problems in peoples lives and messes around with Johnny Depp without any real chemistry.If you like things light and fluffy (possibly like a Three Musksteers), then this movie is for you. If you like things more dark and flavorful then please watch ""Like Water for Chocolate."""
2,Bad for your teeth,"Set in the late 1950's, a gypsy woman and her young daughter literallly blow into a tiny French town to open a Chocolaterie, during the period of Lent no less. This causes problems for the town mayor and his precious townsfolk. He thinks her prescence will tempt his folk into succumbing to their sinful vices, such as erm, chocolate. Glossy, saccharine and dripping with sentimentality, this ""chick flick"" for the over 30's cannot even be saved by the creditable direction of Lasse Holmstrom. ""Chocolat"" is not an International art-house movie, it's actually as close to Hollywood feel-good sap as you can get."
4,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful fable with beautiful performances carefully nuanced to strike just the right tone for high farce. And no, my friend, the title is not ""spelled wrong"" or misspelled as some might say, it is French."
1,Egads!! What a horrific bore.,"I can't believe Amazon recommended this...to ME! What a pretentious, boring, silly film. The plot is straight out of a porno: a woman moves into a small town and starts selling candies that get the natives all hot and bothered...Hoo-boy!Even if you added a few gun battles and car chases into this dreck, it would probably still stink like last weeks garbage."
4,Wow Cool Movie!,"This movie is so cool I can hardy stand for it! I like how the sexy lady comes to town and make all the dumb church people have sex!!! That is so cool. Chocolate is a well-known afrodesiac, you know. And chruch people need to get a lif!!!!This was my favorite movie of all times beside Cidor House Rules and Goodwill Hunting which also is good. This movie has a good moral that people should [have more fun]! Plus I like the seenary."
2,Boring,"Highly acclaimed. That, I knew. I watched the first 30 minutes, which is 1/4 of the movie, before I decided to hang it up. New lady moves into a conservative French town and opens a chocolate shop. This upsets the local church, even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate. Okay. Can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot? Nope. This one's boring."
2,"""Tranquillite'"" - that means ""tranquility"", ya' know!,","Any film that combines Juliette Binoche with Johnny Depp seems worth seeing just for the absurdity factor. This one is *such* a Hollywood-esque take on small-town French life. You know you're in trouble when the opening voice-over (in English, as is the entire film) describes the ""tranquillite'"" of the village ... and then feels compelled to translate ""tranquillite'"" into English. And then there's the foolishness of Johnny Depp playing an Irish traveler who plays steel guitar - including a very uptown version of Django's ""Minor Swing"".This is another example of an interesting and slightly strange slice of European life made innocuous and comforting for American audiences.Nonetheless, I'll confess that the film is fun, predictable fluff. It's probably worth watching on a flight to Europe, if only because your actual experiences there will be *so* much more thought-provoking and rewarding."
2,needs more depp,depp saved this movie. he isn't in it enough. when he is the screen lights up. laugh and dance along with the ever so handsome Roux.
4,scrumptous,"its a delicious movie about a woman and her daughter who come to a town which is strickly religious and they make chocolate. then Depp comes to town(with his geetar) and the 2 become romantically in love, thats right, love, the power of love. for Depp fans of romantic movie fans. a must see"
3,Mixed feelings on this one...,"On one hand this movie is lush, sensual and beautiful. I thought the director's use of color and symbolism were excellent. Also, the actors perform beautifully and not ""over the top"" as might be expected. On another level, I had problems with the movie's anti-Catholic stance. I know that this is ""just a movie,"" and I'm not even Catholic, but I definitely see a movement in our society that paints Catholics, Christians, etc. as repressed and in need of ""deliverance,"" no pun intended."
4,A nice movie,I enjoyed this movie very much. It's not your average love story of tortured hearts. It is mixed with some fun whimsy and a sexy Gypsy.
5,Chocolate,"Great movie, kind of a chick flick with a great story line. And what makes it even better is that Johnny Depp is in it."
4,Chocolat a Delightful Confection,"Today I watched the film Chocolat, what a wonderful experience .Finally a movie where the characters tell the story."
5,The spirit of chocolate personified.,"""Chocolat"" is delicious! It captures the spirit and lusciousness of chocolate and personifies it in a terrific cast. Not only the writer of the original story, but the director, too, must be chocolate lovers. Highly recommended."
2,"OK, but disappointing relationships.","This movie was OK, but less than I expected, especially from the character as it was written, not as it was played by Johnny Depp - he was superb. If you enjoyed this movie, definitely see THE MAN WHO CRIED with Depp and Christina Ricci. I liked it better."
4,A Feel Good Movie!,"I love this movie. It has it all... plus Johnny Depp! But even without him, I love the story, and the fabulous actors in this wonderful tale of romance, heartbreak,and quiet heroism. (And I'm a sucker for a happy ending!).Cuddle up with a mug of hot chocolate (and a few truffles wouldn't hurt). Enjoy. Alone, or with someone, it's great. And the soundtrack will put you in another world.Gift idea: Make it a theme.Buy the DVD, add some truffles, a canister of imported hot cocoa,and maybe a chocolate scented candle, or whatever else you may think of. WOW!!!"
5,Who can resist chocolate?,"In this movie chocolate is used as a symbol for sexual desires at a time when people rarely expressed their inner feelings openly.Ironically Vianne (Julliette Binoche) opens her shop in a conservative French village at a time when everyone was celebrating Lent, a fasting time for Catholics. She challenged their desires and discipline while they challenged her ambition and patience.I did not recognize Johnny Depp in this movie. After seeing him in this role I wish I could see him playing ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" or ""A Tale of Two Cities""Overall this is one of the movies I would like to watch over and over again!"
3,ok..,I guess it doesn't count when you change the wrapping and add a note there after you purchase it. Then what's the point of giving you that option.
3,Johnny Depp,"As far as I am concerned, Johnny Depp is best thing in this film.How sweet and handsome he is!"
5,One of My Favorite Films,"Why is CHOCOLAT a favorite film? Please don't ask me why. I was really enamored by Johnny Depp, was studying French art and had a trip to France planned with my school at the time of this film's release. Juliette Binoche is really fantastic in this film. The film itself is so viewable and continues to be so on repeated viewings. I think the lure is how Juliette Binoche's character has such an effect of the townspeople bring out all their repressions. However, Binoche being just as human as the rest is affected by Depp's arrival. Without being deep, I just think this film tells us something about who we are and helps us explore our own ambitions and frailties. I really like this movie."
3,Women's movie ... but pretty good,"This movie follows an increasingly common theme. Men are pretty much all pigs. The only meaningful intimacies are between women. The Johnny Depp character is very shallow and superfluous and provides only an unconvincing heterosexual love interest for Juliete Binoche. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it's an engaging film and worth watching."
5,Deliciously Depp!,I loved this movie. Great story line. A MUST SEE for any one who loves chocolate &/or Johnny Depp...his sexiest role yet.
2,"Left off the ""e"".","Another entry in the indie-film-genre-featuring-beautiful-women-who-are-really-good-cooks. This time, it's a chocolatier in a small town in France, who has the cheek to open her shop during Lent. When she arrives in town with her fatherless daughter, both wearing Hawthorney red cloaks, the experienced filmgoer will emit a weary sigh: it's to be another harangue about narrow-minded villagers who've yet to fully experience Life, which is represented in this movie by bon-bons. This has all been done better before. Not only that, director Lasse Hallstrom imbues the set with a pseudo-art house surrealism, which is not alleviated by the ""international"" cast, most of whom (except for Juliette Binoche and Peter Stormare) don't know how to speak with a French accent. Johnny Depp is especially jarring as an ""Irish gypsy"" (!) Finally, the title itself is pretentious: since everyone speaks English, the dropping of the ""e"" at the end of ""chocolate"" is an obvious bid at art-house respectability."
4,Sugar & Spice & Everything Nice,"Movies are a form of escapism. Escapism into sci-fi, pre-historic times or just plain vicarious living. In this case it's escaping into the fact that chocolate will ""cure"" what ails you. I must have believed it too, because I bought a Skor bar after the movie.The cast is terrific. The scenery is breathtaking. The cast in the scenery is terrifically breathataking. Once more, casting chocolate is breathtakingly terrific. As for those anti-Catholic naysayers, well Accepting Change is more apt to this fairy tale than being anti-tradition. I gave up chocolate for Lent, but watched Chocolat on DVD, all the while. Usually, when I have the time to watch a 2 hour long movie, two-thirds into the movie, I know if a movie is good or bad, and while Chocolat may have run 20 minutes longer than necessary, it is worth it in the end. A very rare exception in today's crop of [movies]"
5,My love for Chocolat,"I just recently saw this move after longing to see it for about three months. Let me say i was not disappointed. The story is one you can relate to, the people are real, and the chocolat is delicious.I loved Vivian because she was a free spirit. She cared not what the villagers thought of her, though she di dbecome angry when the mayor steps too far. She protects, stands up for what she believes in and makes wonderful hot chocolate.I thought Roux was a interesting character. He was a wonderful musician, who could almost read vivian's mind. He had a soft heart, and a longing to be known for who he was not what he was.all in all i would rate this movie a 5 out of 5.You have to see it."
4,Plain Jane,"I purchased this DVD because Johnny Depp is in it. I am a big fan of his. I like this movie because he sings and plays the guitar in it..which is something we don't get to see him do in other movies. Even in this movie you could see a shadow of things to come in him as ""Captain Jack Sparrow""....he is the perfect man to play the pirate parts. He has the look and actions. The movie itself has a pretty good story but I would not have purchased it had Johnny Depp not been in it."
5,Chocolat,"Chocolat was a lovely story It was a lot about being yourself against adversity and standing up for what you believe in. Great acting by Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp. Alfred Molina was exceptional. Movie was romantic, dramatic,and some comedy thrown in. HIghly recommend this for anyone."
2,1080i,"****BEWARE*** this release is the 1080i version.(hence the two star rating) if u dont care.. then buy away. Other than that, this a Great movie...."
2,Getting impatient with fake Irish,"This movie seems to be universally loved, and the cinematography is lush, but the pace thunked to a halt for us with the appearance of Johnny Depp. Maybe it is his unconvincing Irish accent, but a slow, charming film became self-conscious and unwatchable when he showed up as, for Pete's sake, an Irish ""river rat."" We like Depp but he seems out of place. (For a wonderful, also slow, but unerring Lasse Hallstrom film, consider 'An Unfinished Life'.) On the plus side, the preparation and serving of chocolate is done beautifully; the skills of the director and cinematographer in this regard are wonderful."
5,Bound to be a Classic!,"This is a great movie (chick flick) with a romantic story line, as well as intrigue, resolution of moral issues, great acting, and a little eye candy provided by Johnny Depp. A bowl of popcorn and a fine wine on a snowy evening and you're all set for a fun movie night at home with the girlfriends."
5,Scrumptious!,"Beautiful movie. Wonderfully acted, produced, written. This film calls to mind Babette's Feast, but has even better defined characters than the older film. Time well spent!"
2,Too perfect to believe...,"The set and camera work are excellent, and the story even decent. The actors, in particular Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp, are clearly trying hard to look authentic, but failing. I prefer stories where the actors that woo me into believing that they are not pretending at all, but simply being themselves.Judi Dench is a notable exception, adding some class to the film. She is clearly the most skilled actress of the lot."
5,Delightful movie...,"A work of art that motivates and inspires the mind to look beyond one's day to day routine. Very entertaining, with a delightfully discrete manner of opening your eyes to the reality of love and aging."
3,Low-calorie charmer,"This is a gorgeously produced movie with its heart in the right place, but ultimately it fails to deliver more than the merest trifle (pun intended) of entertainment. It's all SO well-intended and politically correct, and the story is barely believable. (How did this woman who shows up in town on foot, with only two suitcases, manage to equip and stock a confectionery store?) I enjoyed it while it lasted, even though I felt that the movie was trying to manipulate my emotions, but it left no lasting impression. Enjoy it for what it is --- a (semi) modern-day fantasy or fable -- but don't expect greatness. It's not as good as most reviewers would have you believe!"
5,What's wrong with you people?,This movie is fantastic! The Comte is not the moral character in this movie. He stands for legalism and Vianne is someone who wants to help others and yet she is cursed by her mother's actions. The true moral character is the young priest who is forced to give sermons written by the Comte.The Chocolate is the main character and it brings comfort to others in an almost magical way.The soundtrack is wonderful. The scenery is exotic. My wife and I love this movie and you will too!
4,Enjoyable escapism,"Having watched this film only at the insistence of my wife, I resisted its charms as long as possible. I mean, come on, it's a mystical/mystery/romance/ensemble/cookbook! But the portrayal of small town French life soon won me over, and I set aside my reservations to just enjoy what was offered (not unlike a Hershey's bar?) The performances are uniformly good -- Juliette Binoche is, as always, beautiful and earthy, while Johnny Depp does a convincing Irish vagabond. Hallstrom's direction is aesthetically pleasing, from the quaint town to the delicious-looking chocolate. So if you're not expecting too much, I think you'll enjoy the film."
4,Not bad...,"About a lady picking up and moving to different towns. She embarks this town, where they pretty much disregard and try to run out anyone who is different from them (non church going, etc).She comes by and opens up a Chocolat shop, around Lint and Easter mind you. So she's as evil as they come (as this is set in the 50's), according to most of the town's people. Needless to say she manages to keep her shop open and stay in town, even though all the town talks about her and her child.Eventually she makes friends with a few (also black sheeps of the town) and helps them out with a few situations. And in the long run they all come around and keeps her in town, as she decided it was time to move on.I recommend the movie, it's nice, it's family orientated. It's a drawn out but pleasant."
5,Yum like Chocolate,This movie is one of the best movies i've seen so far.I actually own the VHS versian but this movie is great and i just watch it again and again.WARNING:You will get hungry during the movie so be sure to have some (chocolate)with you when watching
2,Sad,"I like the movie. It is the quality that was the problem. It came skipping and ended up freezing my dvd player. Tried putting in a different movie, the other movie played perfectly fine. This particular dvd is just faulty."
5,johnny depp in an interesting role,Chocolat is a very interesting and different movie. The scenery is very pretty and the town where it is filmed is novel. Loved the story. It is kind of like an old fairy tale.
4,Chocolat,"This was an extremely good adult movie, I would say, it would be better on a large screen but was not to bad on my computer.Bjhj"
5,great movie,"great movie, love johnny depp, had some trouble with it connecting to the tv with amazon but otherwise great buy"
2,Chocolat,"Oh well, it had a very bed review from very popular art and cinema critic from my community, mainly about Juliette Binoche performance, just wanted to make my mind about it objectively, could not believe that forced my self to watch it until the and, or maybe i didn't... can't remember now, very disappointing performance and movie in general..."
3,Something About Faux French Sets My Teeth On Edge,"A sweet story, based on a better novel. This falls in that food meets sex and gets blurry genre that the Nigella Lawson crowd loves so well. The actors and actresses are cute, the locations lovely, Judy Dench rules the world, the food bits quite tasty to watch and the story moves along nicely.I think the thing that gets me about it is that it is supposed to be French, but it is so Americanized that I found myself wondering if they filmed it in Disneyland. Also, the pat, happy ending is very American.I await the fusillade of negative votes from people who liked the movie. Fire away mes amis!"
5,Sensual Magic,"And of course, by sensual, I mean the literal definition ... this movie tweaks the senses in the most glorious way. Until this movie, my favorite was The Unbearable Lightness of Being which, coincidentally, starred both Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin together. I agree that this is not much of a ""deep thinking"" film, but it transforms you magically to this fantastic land ... who would even know if it existed ... and who would care? The soundtrack is phenomenal, as well, and takes you right back to place and time. If you like movies like Ever After, Unbearable Lightness, Hope Floats ... in other words if you're a helpless romantic like me, you'll love this movie ... no question."
1,OVER RATED!,"The first thing I would like to say is this is a ""good"" movie,not great not even the best you'll see this year just good.Ok so maybe I'm acting like Kenneth Turan saying I liked it but it dosent deserve even three stars at least but Miramax will have to balme themselves.This year Miramax ran the most tasteless oscar campaign since John Wayne did with The Alamo.Ok now for the film,its and ok movie.Good music,nice photograpy and Alfred Molina is great but thats about it.It didn't make me feel great or anything it was just a movie you go see and you soon forget it.I'm not saying don't go see it,but just because it was nominated for best picture dosent mean it deserves it,it stole that from Billy Elliot,Almost Famous,or Dancer in the Dark. I hear Weinstein actually feels embearessed for the Chocolat campaign,good he should be."
3,Total Chick Flick,If you're a guy. Skip it. If you are a woman. Buy it and torchure your boyfriend/husband for a couple of hours.
1,Pretentious and dull,"A huge budget film trying to look and feel like and indie... and failing miserably. Johnny is wooden, Juliette is awkward and the dialog is stilted.And shame on this film for making a Protestant minister the story's ignorant villain. Protestants have been massacred, repressed and persecuted in France for centuries. Protestants account for less than 2% of the French population today. Villainizing the Huguenot church when this faith has already suffered so much prejudice in France is insensitive and irresponsible. Will the film's sequel feature an ignorant, villainous rabbi in 20th Century Germany? Nothing quite like kicking a people and their faith when they've already suffered from near-extinction..."
2,Director Again Demolishes Strawman,"What could have been a cute, enjoyable movie is reduced to ashes by the obvious stereotypes and the silly slapstick posturing. Let's see -- Roman Catholicism is bad, so let's create a caricature of it to demolish; fathers are bad, so let's create a wonderful Mom-only family to raise a little girl; neighbors are bad and strangers are good, so let's create some unpleasant neighbors (wife-beater) and some attractive strangers; moderation and self-control are bad, so let's cast our best actress as an out-of-control diabetic on a binge. How silly!!"
2,what a movie.,"this movie was not what i expectedthe story was not well developped and i don't understand how vianne got all the money and all the cocoa in the middle of a little town in france. to me that sounds quite impossible.anyways, it's not a horrible movie, but i think the writers should have done some more research."
1,No Closed Captions!,"Purchased this blu-ray disc assuming it would have closed captions and it doesn't. Not sure why it does not, maybe it cost less? Amazon lists two blu-ray versions of Chocolat. The other, older one states that it has closed captions. I just ordered it as I need closed captions."
3,Disappointing for the Depp fan,"This movie, like many others, is a little better with the deleted scenes. Fortunately, the story line is not hosed by the cuts . . . just clearer. For Johnny Depp fans, it is disappointing that the star enters the storyline only in the last third of the movie and not for enough time to warrant his appearing in the promotional stills. It is a worthwhile purchase though."
4,Keeps hair dark and cool,"I have been dying my hair for years and recently had my blonde hair dyed black. Although the dye was permanent it began to wash off after 2 days and by 2 weeks I had medium brown hair. Instead of redying my hair I decided to give black malva a try and it worked! I was amazed by how dark it made my hair after one hour. Be aware, however, that if you had blonde hair before black it will leave hair with a greenish tone."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED !,"I have medium lenght dark brown hair. It is normally shiny, soft, with very few grey hair . I thought this product would give my hair a nice deeper darker shade and even more shine. After I have used Aveda Black Malva conditioner, my hair is not shiny anymore and it gets greasy after only 2 days. This product will go in the trash very soon; that's a shame because it's expensive."
3,Great but messy,"This product works great but it's a bit messy. It also isn't the best conditioner in the world...though it does smell nice, classic Aveda scent. But it does keep your hair very dark and it doesn't dye your tile or anything, though it will dye your towel. I use it about once every 3 or 4 times I wash the rest of the time I use a regular color conditioner."
5,Depend with velcro,"I purchase this item for my mother. She is unable to find the Depend undergarments with VELCRO in local stores. She suffers from arthritis and the undergarments with BUTTONS just are not an option for her.I highly recommend this item for anyone with arthritis, on a limited income, and not in need of the full panty."
3,Those velcro closures ...,"What a pain! I got these for my mom. The velcro closures are a big issue. They come undone very easily. You shift position they come undone. You bend, they come undone. Not particularly user friendly. You cannot wear the pads without the velcro closures or the pads will slide down your legs. So not cool!"
2,"Waiting for ""improved"" Depend product be shipped.","After talking with Kimberly Clark customer service, I was told many people (including me)are not happy with the way they ""improved"" the Depends I use. Therefore, as of September, 2006, they went back to the original Depends (wider, not folded so impossible to open). I'm still waiting for my Amazon order to start shipping the ""new"" Depends."
3,THEY STAY WHERE YOU PUT THEM,I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY MOM DURING HER LAST YEARS OF LIFE. SHE WAS VERY THANKFUL FOR THEM AND THEY WORKED GREAT TO KEEP HER CLEAN AND DRY.
5,SAVE money and buy by the roll.,The Porter-Cable 4 1/2 inch adhesive-backed sanding roll is an economical way to buy sand paper. The adhesive holds well and the paper is of good quality.
5,The Real Ted Kennedy,This is an older book but still tells the bare truth about Ted Kennedy. No moral Compass here. This is a well researched book and does a great job of reconstructing the events at Chappaquiddick that fateful night. Those who are too young to remember this event would do well to find and read this book or one of the many other good ones on the topic to get a more balanced idea of who Ted was.
4,More Kennedy history,This book has been an interesting read. I was first told about this book many years ago and had been looking for it.
3,Fun schlocky movies,"Like so many of the sci-fi compliations from this company, this one aims to please the die hard B-movie sci-fi fan. The four films on this DVD set are:""Pizza Wars"" (2002)""Waiting for the Giants"" (2000)""Killers from Space"" (1954)""Neophytes & Neon Lights"" (2001)As they say, if you like movies featuring futuristic societies, genies who emerge from bongs and psychic mutants who can see into the future then this is for you."
3,Not as described,"While the filters are fine. The kit apparantly is actually a 37mm kit with a 27-33mm adapter. This doesn't match the compact and sleep look of the Canon Elura 100 I bought the kit for. I contacted 47th Street, and they said that noone makes a 27mm kit and thats why they sell it as a 37. This should be mentioned, and I'm guessing 27mm filters indeed exist."
2,Problem with the MousePad,"I've had this computer for 6 months. The system works well, but the mousepad is a disaster and makes all use of it frustrating. It's not responsive - I have to press the left-click button 1-3 times to get it to work. It is also not an ergonomic key pad. Think about this before you buy, the buttons are ineffective, and positioned for elf hands - I've never had hand strain in 15 years of computing until this HP! My wife's Dell is the opposite - easy buttons and ergonomic. I only use my HP with a different mouse in the USB port.It has shut down once or twice for no reason, and sometimes won't start without pressing the ""reset"" button, but otherwise it's been smooth riding with the system itself."
1,poor quality,"These sanding pads wear out very quickly, twice as fast as the home depot ones. Better to get the more expensive ones at home depot, better quality. Written by a contractor. Not worth getting."
2,Another Killer Vampire Movie ;-),"I collect vampire movies. I purchased this one, and watched it and it wasn't too bad. It had a good feel of the 70s in it. The people at the film studio had to have made money on this one. The opening shot at the dock used the same footage that was used in Blackula. I didn't expect it to be an Academy award winner, and I was not too disappointed."
3,"Yorga, Smorga!","Yikes! I must have been stoned when originally viewing this in the theatre. I'd watch it only for pure camp now or at Halloween. The acting is hammy (but lovable)and only one actor emerged unscathe from this project (Michael Murphy) to go on to better things.Rent this DVD, then quickly return it to the store. This is fun along with ""Blacula"" for those dreary nights when television thinks it is offering us their best. Dim the lights, butter up the popcorn and be prepared to howl. Now what was I thinking of? Does anyone want a used DVD?"
4,A Lot Better than the Average Vampire Movie,"I have seen this movie quite a few time and I must say that I'm a fan of the Count Yorga films. This film is better than the last three Christopher Lee Dracula movies. For a low-budget movie, it offered good acting from Robert Quarry, eerie scenes (the stuck van and dead kitten scenes), and a surprise ending. The style is much different than the Hammer films and it's a fairly hip 70's movie.I have around 130 vampire movies and this movie is in the top 20, so it's pretty good. You've probably read what this movie is about, so If you're looking for something other than a Christopher Lee movie, pop up some popcorn and and watch this movie late at night (with the lights out)...you won't be disappointed."
5,"Excellent Vampire film,one of the best!.","Count Yorga, Vampire.If the title sounds kind of bland or just not as glamourous or intriging as others;'rest assured' this is an excellent movie!!,one of the best of it's genre.This is definately not some thrown together production,the cast were all good,the sets were not the cheap low budget types you normally see in horror films from the 60's 70's And the script was pretty decent too! all in all worth purchasing for a cold winters night when you want to watch a horror film with ""class"". It didn't hurt at all either that the lead actor is handsome...or maybe the fact that he bears a striking resemblance to my husband has left me somewhat biased...oh well, great movie!!!. You'll see. :-)"
3,Wonderfully awful,This is one of those low-rent horror films you typically catch late-night on Halloween. A great flick to watch with friends and get a running commentary going; the kitten scene is an absolute classic.
2,OUTDATED AND TOOTHLESS,"When the two Yorga movies came on the scene in the early seventies, they were lauded for their novel take on a familiar theme. Made on shoestring budgets with hardly any special effects, the movies relied on pervasive moods and sinister lighting. We don't know much about Yorga's history, just that he's suddenly in Los Angeles, posing as a psychic to lure beautiful women into his lair. Robert Quarry is effectively sinister as the Count, but he comes nowhere near the finesse of Frank Langella or the pure evil of Christopher Lee. Michael Murphy (Tanner and Tanner) has the thankless role of one of the young men out to snare the vampire, and Roger Perry (Barbara Eden Show) is hopelessly tedious as the knowledgeable chain-smoking doctor. A voice over from veteran character actor George Macready (Peyton Place) is campy but ridiculous. There are lots of unintentional (?) laughs, and thirty five years later, the Yorga series of two seems outlandishly outdated."
3,Fairly good modern vampire film,"This film focuses on a group of young people who go to Count Yorga who is suppposedly attempting to help a young women reach her deceased mother's spirit. This is followed by some strange behavior from two of the girls, their boyfriends consult a doctor who is beginning to think Yorga is a vampire posing as an expert on the supernatural. Eventually the men journey back to Yorga's house to see if he is a vampire or not. This is a fairly good, but dated film. Robert Quarry is great as the vampire and more complex than most movie vampires. The plot works well enough and the rest of the cast is overall good. This does fall into the trap of some old cliches like a black cape (in the 1970's no less), a chamber room and an ugly henchmen. This is an above average vampire film and certainly one of the better American vampire flicks."
4,BEST AMERICAN VAMPIRE FILM TO DATE,Count Yorga is a great frighting film from the 70s.The setting is as follows vampire starts a undead legion of female blood suckers.Then a group of guys head to the yorga estate to stop him from turning a girl into the undead.Best part the guys run all over the manor while Yorga tries to flee with a girl.Do they succeeded in killing the vampire yes but?
3,it's okay,"It's an okay book. Not too thrilled by it. Most of the pictures are black and white. Methods are kind of old. The one copy I got have a couple pages torn, which is really annoying. I could've sent it back but too much trouble. Guess it's okay for some fundamentals of figure painting but I wouldn't expect too much out of it."
2,Caveat Emptor,"This is a coffee table book filled with photos of the authors in various poses with some of their musings as text. These two darlings of the New York Downtown crowd are Cooler Than Thou, and this book reeks of vanity, a quality I thought great yogis exorcised from their Selves. If you want a book to help you learn yoga, try Light On Yoga, Yoga the Iyengar Way, Donna Farhi's book, Schiffman's (Moving Into Stillness), etc. If you're a Gannon/Life fan and you like looking at them, this is your bible."
4,Excellent resource for scholarly study,"Mbiti expounds several key themes of importance to a new or experienced student of African Religion and society. Particularly, Mbiti concisely explains the interwoven nature that exists between the various religions of different African people and everyday life.I highly recommend this work to any person interested in learning more about the role of religion in Africa."
4,Wild Yam Root,"So far, so good. I've been taking little doses of this product for about two weeks and haven't had any side effects at all. Would definitely recommend this herbal product."
4,What the Hell?,"Killer Klowns from Outer Space...I knew before I even watched it that it was just a spoof and not to be taken seriously...but wow...just wow. I liked this movie, but...it's retarded. I mean it's ninety minutes of pure stupidity...which should be downright obvious to anyone with a nervous system. I thought it was a fun movie...but definitely dumb fun. Take an hour and a half out of your life to lose some IQ points with this movie. You might not regret it."
5,masterpiece of clowns!,excellent movie !great effects and decent plot! jewel from 80's and this version comes with a lot of interesting extras
1,The best hoax ever?,"Basically, lots of folks started talking about how honest to God awful this movie is, and how they were going to troll everyone before trolling was invented by saying it is the best scary movie ever.It's fairly epic that most of the reviews place this movie as a 4+ star ride of awesome, but honestly, it isn't, every single good review managed to think this movie is great because they were tricked by someone else.The power of suggestion over human minds is pretty powerful, as I myself have partaken in this joke, and this is the only place you'll find a review by me that's honest in relation to how terrible this movie is, from the effects to the acting to the actual plot.A grade A stinker that nobody should watch, but everyone should tell someone else to see it for it's 5 stars of greatness!"
5,The best B-movie ever made,"Dude, this is one of the greatest movies of all time. Just buy it. It's awesome. The added short-films that the writers created as kids was pretty sweet, too."
4,Great If you love 1980's Horror!,when i first saw this movie when i was 8 i knew that it would be a movie i would watch forever. any true horror movie lover would like to see this original movie from 1988!
3,A first rate B-movie...,"I am sure this movie is familiar to any horror genre loving person. Its a b movie for sure, but one that is hard to say no to. Not for its special effects or stellar acting, mind you, but for its shear laughable plot. Killer Klowns come to a small town to wreak havoc with their popcorn guns and to drink blood from their captives, who are spun in cotton candy cocoons. And though you may find yourself snickering, you can't turn it off. I personally love this movie and couldn't resist the low price tag attached to it. The DVD itself its nothing spectacular, average sound and picture quality and no extras out of the ordinary. But what did you expect, although you may like the movie, you couldn't have expected them to put alot of money or effort into it. Its a B movie, but with an A attraction all its own. If you like, buy it, its worth it."
2,Not as Good as I Remember,I know there are plenty of people who love this movie and I remember seeing it when I was young. It was not scary then and its not scary now. It is good cheesy fun though with a lot of bad acting and a plot to not even care about. I liked it enough to set through once again in my older years now and I have to say my movie tastes have changed enough to where this movie isn't worth a second watch. Special features aren't great at all even though they are there for people who care. Picture quality is good and so is audio but other than that not much going for it. I know its a cult favorite and that's fine for most fans if you like it that much but its not really going to be for everyone. That is usually the way it goes for cult favorites though it is usually love or hate. It is good to watch again if you haven't seen it for a while but other than that not much here anymore.
5,Awesome!,This is by far the best clown movie ever made. It also includes a lot of funny one-liners throughout the movie. One of my personal favorites. Do yourselves a fvor and rent it one night!
3,Unusual for a studio at any time...,"How this got made, I don't know. What I do know is that this was worth the $[PRICE] I paid for it. This is an absolutely packed DVD from MGM, with two deleted scenes, audio commentary, a feature split into five parts, a blooper reel, storyboards, a still gallery, and, oh yeah, the actual movie.The movie itself is mostly notable for how good it looks considering the budget (which even back in the 80s was basically dirt) and the cheerfully cruel humor coming up with violent ways to kill people with circus equipment. Really, that's the reason to see this movie. Something to admire if you've worked with no money, and worth adding to your collection for the humor value."
4,Got Sequal?,I love this movie...it rocks! one of the best Midnite Movies ever!!! i would have givin it 5 starts but it just needed a little bit more! it ended and you just want more!!! i first watched it on sci-fi and then later that day (or week) i went out and bought it on VHS. then about 5 or 6 months later it came out on DVD and i bought it! thier is tons of special features (to many to list!) if you like cheesy horror flicks with a little bit of scares then buy this! i will never eat cotton candy again!
3,Cheesy and Campy...fun!,"Yes, I should have spelled those with a K but I didn't feel like it. This film is pure 80s, clothing, hairstyles, performances, etc.; even the special effects, although that's a bonus. While some effects are highly cheesy, the Klowns are well-realized and creepy. The cast are intentionally goofy (think of films like the original ""The Blob""), with the exception of the John Vernon who steals the entire film.Interestingly enough, there were a few scenes in the film that actually gave me the creeps, unlike a lot of contemporary horror. It's bad, but in a good way.And clowns are scary, let's face it."
5,Killer Klowns rock my World...,"The whole movie is cheesy, but you cant help but love it. Although I just recently upgraded from VHS to the DVD which was only $7.50 at walmart... so sorry amazon... walmart has cheaper cheesy... but other then that this movie is a total classic and i suggest buying it for the clown phobic friend:)"
3,Can't go to sleep. The Klown will eat me!!!,"Wow!! After reading the exhaustive reviews, I feel inadeqaute. The reviews are much better than the movie.The movie itself is awful, filled with has-beens and never-weres to act in a terrible script and plot. An alien species, who just happen to resemble clowns, descend to earth to go grocery shopping. Invading a small town (why always a small town? why not New York?)they wrap their food (read humans) into tidy cotton candy cocoons to enjoy later. The heroes, including a rookie cop and a high-school? nerd battle the klowns to save the town.I guess modern circuses ae a racial memory of previous visits by these aliens which means that we must be tasty."
4,This movie isn't bad...it is a marvel!,"Yes, it sounds so hokey and cliched that you probably will think that it can't work. But it does! This movie has a sense of humor, and it is quite funny. (You've got to love the scene where the clown knocks the biker's head off after he destroys his toy bicycle.) It is also quite scary at times as the clowns become less playful and more deadly. Weird, irresistible, and utterly entertaining, this is one ""B-flick"" that you've gotta see!"
5,Best clown movie of all time!,"This movie is great I first saw this movie when I was 14,when this movie first came and at first I thought this was going to be a dumb movie and when it finished I was pleased with the F/X and I thought this is one of the real sci-fi classics and I hope that this movie will come out on DVD."
3,"Corny, funny, but a hell load of fun...","Sure this film is a bit stupid, but it was never meant to be taken seriously, as it features clowns..er.Klowns. Not too bad F/X and the film has its moments along with a nifty soundtrack at the end of the film."
5,what i want for christmas,to be put in simple words i love this film and i must own it. grammar is not my strong point but this movie is. basically i love it more than anythingelse.
4,I <3 cheesy 80's movies!,"killer klowns from outer space is the best. i love the balloon track dogs, cotton candy people, shadow dinasours that eat real people. i love it for being a cheesy moive, just sad it was a vhs. recently gave my vhs player away so was unable to play it."
3,i actually didn't watch this.,this was ordered by my childs friend who went on the computer and clicked order. apparently i was logged in and set up for one click ordering. learned that lesson the hard way.... we didn;t watch it.
2,HAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAHAH...egh,"........I love a cheesy horror flick just as much as the next guy, but come on please this is ridiculous.Big ""Klowns"" run around with killer ""Klown"" stuff killing teenagers?this is really ridiculous.Ok some of the ""Klowns"" do look sort of cool, and i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because you can laugh at it in parts, but none the less, i wouldnt buy it."
2,Slow starting,"This movie starts off way too slow, and I lost interest before I could get to any of the cool parts. Unfortunately, I'm the kinda guy that just can't fast forward, so I never bothered to watch the rest."
4,When I was a kid....,"I remember watching this movie as a kid, and it literally scared the crap out of me! I saw it on tv recently, and I realized how dumb I was for freaking out about a comedy... LOL. This movie is pretty funny though (now that I've seen it as an adult)."
4,Funny Horror Flick,"We caught the last half of Killer Klowns from Outer Space while flipping channels and got a good laugh out of it. The premise was just so silly and the clowns so ridiculous that we laughed most of the way through it. The clowns came up with all kinds of clever ways to kill their victims, all variations of silly clown tricks.The movie doesn't try to be anything other than it is, even the acting is stupidly bad, but that's okay because it is all great fun. 4 stars!"
4,Great Movie,"I remember seeing this movie on TV as a little kid, but since then hadn't seen it for a long time until I bought it. This is a GREAT movie for anyone who likes dumb movies like me, but even if you don't, this movie will still keep you laughing. The clowns are very funny, especially the little one. I definitely recomend it."
5,The BEST HORROR/COMEDY EVER!,Now! in my whole life I was never fond of mixed movies and that REALLY goes for putting Comedy and Horror as one. BUT! This movie does it SO WELL! This Movie IS SO Funny! There is NO way in HELL you could not love this movie! maby 5 stars is overseeding it as a movie. But its what I'm gonna get it. Since I'm so Happy I own it.
5,THE COOLEST MOVIE!!,"I saw this when I was like 6 so, I don't remember it that much since I'm 13 now, all I remember is the end where that guy pops the clown with his badge or something and then the pies hit them and it goes off..."
3,Not too shabby,"Though the plot and dialogue was mainly stupid and uncreative, the clowns were the best part of all. If they hadn't looked the way they did in this movie, then i wouldn't have been freaked out. This movie is pretty good, but what makes it get three stars is the make-up and costume job on the clowns"
5,Killer Klowns,I first watched this movie when I was 13 or 14. It's not scary at all but it is funny. May not be for ppl that doesn't like clowns already but hey give it a try.
5,love it!,"got this for my husband, he had been wanting this movie. So happy we have it now. yes, it may be a corny movie but oh well."
4,Great laughs..,"Old school movie, brought back alot memories & laughs, good for a fun family night at the movies. and tyhe dog too LOL...."
5,see it over and over,you will never get tired of this classic. friends will like it. see it at least once in your life
4,Klowning Around,"Killer Klowns rates up there as one of the cult classics of all time. It makes fun of itself, the audience and the concept regularly. Suggested companion videos should include Polergeist or any of the Cirque de Solei series. If you love classic horror, you will abhor this film. It's camp, but it's well done (They actually had a budget!). Watch at your own risk, and see you under the Big Top."
4,"Original, you have to give it that.","Giant paper mache heads on actors as they terrify an amusement park. Typical 80's fashion and lingo. If you got nothing better to do after you mow the lawn, stick it in and scare the kids."
4,So bad it's good!,"This is very campy. I don't know if it's supposed to be funny or serious, but it's funny. The scariest clowns I've ever seen. This will give small kids nightmares. But adults will laugh. It's worth the price. You'll have fun with this one. Just don't take it seriously. You'll never look at clowns the same way again."
3,A horror flim for the Kids,"Killer Klowns from outer space is a good horror flim for the kids because in is mild-violence but still has some great scenes for example in the scene where vetern actor John Vernon is being used as a puppet by one of the klowns to talk to the deputy that is a the best scene in the whole movie i think. It is a B-movie so your going to see little actors you know. The movie also as some funny scenes in it one i can think of is where Mikes the main charactors horny two best friends meet the killer klown chicks who are also horny. the movie is good and I think it is good enough to rent but i dont know about buying. features, great make up work, alright acting, and a somewhat good ending."
3,killer klowns from outer space,"this movie is a typical D movie, very bad, but that is what makes it so good. no high dollar effects, just plain simple camera tricks."
3,Big Top Terror,"The Chiodo (kee-O-doh) brothers' Killer Klowns from Outer Space is one of my guilty pleasures. It's not a great movie...it may not even be a very good movie...but it's still the ultimate clowns-as-monsters movie. The Killer Klowns' spaceship is a circus tent. They wrap people in cotton candy cocoons. They track down victims with a balloon bloodhound. You get the idea.MGM recognized the mixed appeal of this flick with a brand new Special Edition DVD containing a commentary track, early films of the Chiodo brothers and a pristine widescreen print (...)."
5,too much fun!,"this little movie rocks! my boys, who are in their 20's now, ADORED this movie when they were little, and now my grandbaby watches it almost daily! it's got just enough cheese to keep you watching. my favorite character in the movie has to be Paul Terenzi, the goofy-faced ice cream truck guy! not to mention the gorgeous police officer Dave (John Allen Nelson)-whatta hunk! (I think a Killer Klown would be an awesome Halloween costume idea!)"
3,Very entertaining,I enjoyed this movie. I am unable to find it anywhere. Its a mixture of comedy and horror. The exagerated clown faces are humerous along with their other props and toys.
3,I like this movie because its scary and fun at the same time,I enjoyed this movie alot! It's one of my favorites of all time. The special F/X are chessy the acting isn't bad but its just all around campy and thats what add to the creepiness and humor and the magic of this film. I had a fear of clowns and this film made it worse! My advice see it TODAY!!!!
5,Kick Ass!!!,This is the stupidest but coolest sci-fi movie in history. If anyone is willing to sell their English version I am willing to buy. Write to martymcbillie@hotmail.com
5,Vegetarian Cooking That Appeals to Non-Vegetarians,"This isn't just a good vegetarian cookbook--it is just a plain old good cookbook. I am not a vegetarian but I am also not a big meat-eater and I've been looking forever for a vegetarian cookbook that I can live with. This is definately it! The recipes are simple and flavorful and the best part is that the ingredients are not hard to find. Many vegetarian cookbooks rely on specialty foods that can only be found in health food stores, which was always a turn off to me. I highly recommend this book to everyone, herbivore or carnivore!"
2,Very disappointing vegetarian,"I am very disappointed with this visually pretty but gastronomically empty book. I have made several recipes and have found there is just not much to them. So many of the recipes are just dressed up salads that are not very filling. I think Mollie Katzen must eat like a bird because these recipes are just not substantial fare for a family and my children are just not going to eat main dishes centered around mushrooms, etc. Some of the baked goods are okay but in a vegetarian book, I am really looking for great vegetable recipes. I heard that her original Moosewood book is great. Maybe I'll get that one. This one just sits on my shelf!"
2,Disappointing,I made the Savory Corn Cakes and Chipotle Cream because it sounded as though it would be delicious. It wasn't. I ended up tossing the corn cakes outside for the birds and dumping the Chipotle Cream down the drain. Maybe when Katzen makes them they're wonderful. Nothing else looked inviting after that. I think I'll donate this cookbook to our library's booksale.
2,Disappointing,"I love Mollie Katzen's earliest cookbooks - Moosewood and Enchanted Broccoli Forest. Dishes I make from those are relatively easy and very tasty. I have tried a lot of recipes in this cookbook and I have been very disappointed. They just...don't taste as good. I have served some dishes from this cookbook which have remained uneaten on the table. On the other hand, when I use the other two, people usually enjoy the food, and ask me for the recipes. I have learned my lesson, and I don't use it anymore. If you actually want to buy a cookbook which is a useful source of recipes, I do not recommend this one."
5,Loved it!,"I collect cookbooks, especially those with a vegetarian slant, and this one is exceptional. The Firecracker Red Beans and the Pineapple Basmati Pilaf alone are worth the price of admission here. As usual, the author's directions are clear and complete. My only complaint is a lack of pictures. I know that illustrations are more in line with the author's style, but I DO miss the help which pictures give when planning how a meal will look when all put together."
5,Creative Healthy Cuisine,This cookbook provides many fabulous recipes for very healthy meatless meals that are loaded with flavor (try the Persian Kidney Beans) without having excessively long lists of ingredients. Katzen provides a lot of useful information about preparation time and shortcuts.
1,product does not work.,I will never buy from this vender again much less by car parts online. I'll leave it to advance auto because it's just as cheap anyways.
4,Great 4 begginers,"This is ""the LW book"" for begginers, good xplanations, good illustrations. great to introduce you in the program."
1,Waste of my time and money.,"I am a newbie to Lightwave and 3D and I had hoped for this book to ease my transition into this interesting subject. Rather, it caused me grief. There were so many errors that I have to read over and over in order to grasp the faintest idea of what the author seemed to imply. An Advance user may not find the book useful since much of the stuff are geared towards beginners but the number of errors and inconsistencies makes the book a pain for a any beginner. Patrik may know the in and out of Lightwave 3D, but from this book, he failed to get that across. My advice to Patrick - next time you write a book, please spend more time going over it and save unsuspecting victims like me from wasting time and money. As a matter of fact, I'll give the book away for free to the first person who contacts me. This book should never have been sold in the first place."
4,A must have for any Lightwaver,"This is an excellent book, and very applicable to version 7.5 as well. It consists of many small tutorials and has some excellent solutions to complex problems. The only complaint I can find with this book, and the only thing keeping it from 5 stars, is that the book gets you going on creating an effect, then kind of trails off with some suggestions for improving the effect.Some of the effect ideas in this book are well worth the price of the book. Mr. Beck's burning paper effect is awesome, and the time to work thru the tutorial and create the effect is very minimal (5-10 minutes). I've worked several of the tutorials in this book and found myself saying ""Wow!"" quite a few times."
4,Great For Beginners,"This is a great book for beginners trying to understand many of the features LW 6.5 has to offer. Many easy tutorials cover subjects like texturing, simple modeling, gradients, graph editor, simple animations etc. Great for logo and texture projects.This is the book I use to teach an intro to computer graphics class. This book may not be needed for the seasoned LW artist. It doesn't have any character (modeling/ rigging/ animating) techniques.A good addition to your library if you're a beginner. The other books on Lightwave can come later as your skills improve."
1,Jack of (almost) all trades ... Master of None.,"This was a BIG disappointment. The FM radio receiver is a joke. On almost all channels, you need to fully extend the wire antenna in a specific direction (different for each channel), or your reception is full of static. I have a cheap Zenith clock radio that is far superior with no special actions, so you know it can be done; Sony just missed the boat. The Mega Bass is a Mega waste. While this unit does a lot of things, there are no 'nature sounds' or weather station type items, which I think would be better than TV sound. I rated it so low, since it does nothing exceptionally, and for the price, it should. Also, the Sony reputation rightfully warrants a premium on many product lines, but definitely not here. I suggest you keep looking ;)"
3,Small Footprint for Bedside Table But So-So FM,"This is an attractive package with lots of features in a compact unit. The speaker is adequate. AM reception is above average, but you're getting nothing but a little pig tail of an FM antenna (like most clock radios), which gets so-so FM at best and weak FM with hard-to-get stations. CD player can be noisy as it spins. Drives me crazy.I'd suggest getting a strong FM-receving Kaito 1101, 1102, or 1103 (these radios are seventy to hundred dollars) and hooking an audio cable to a nice monoaural speaker, even a Tivoli Model One or a Sangean WR-2."
4,Totally Happy,"What can I say, Sony quality, small footprint because of the ""vertical"" design, and all of the features with discreet controls. Complaints about other systems not having ""dimmable"" display led me to investigate this system, and I am entirely pleased with it. The contols need to be learned by touch and the tactile keys help you home in on the location of the primary buttons. I love this system and could really care less about the loss of the analog TV reception. The sleep timer, CD, 10 programmable FM loccations and weather channels are all crystal clear and easily found with the digital tuning.If you can find one of these gems, get it!"
3,"A ""little"" too little and a little too tall","While this product had all the features I wanted (plug in, alarm clock, radio, CD player with earplugs) and the sound is great - it's not exactly user friendly (I've had it two months now and still have not mastered how to turn the alarm off for the weekends) and the tiny labels on the machine require me to use a magnifying glass. Also, since it is tall, it is not quite as unobtrusive on my night table as I would like. And I've yet to find the weather feature. But all in all, since I could not find another on the market with the features I require, I like it."
3,"Lots of features, awkward controls, no back-up","I was looking for a fully featured unit that would still provide a wakeup even with a headset plugged in. It does this very well. Sound is just OK and controls are still hard to find, but if you're good at memorizing the physical locations of the important buttons, you should be fine. One surprise was the lack of a battery backup for power failures, but I guess it may draw too much power in certain configurations (like CD playing) to suppport this. I liked the clock radio enough to just buy a small UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) but obviously this solution isn't for everyone."
2,Unusable Controls,"Pros:- Good feature set- Decent sound- Auto adjusting back-lightCons:The controls on this alarm clock are simply absurd. I am in a technical profession and not afraid of feature-rich tools and toys. But this clock radio has such confusing and non-intuitive controls that it takes forever to set a new alarm time or adjust the display time or station. More importantly, to turn the alarm off in the morning you really need to turn the light on and squint to find the off button (which is small and located on the front next to a barrage of other buttons of identical size).This is just horribly poor design. In short, had I known how frustrating it was to operate this device I would not have bought it."
2,SonyI FC sound is tinny. I can not recommend it,Sound is tinny. Adding the bass enhancer helps only slightly. i could not recommend this radio.
4,Great alarm clock for the price,"This is a great alarm clock. I have trouble waking up in the morning, but the alarm volume is perfect. I don't think that the controls are awkward at all and I have no problem turning it off in the morning. The sound is also adequate for an alarm clock (after all, you're not buying it for surround sound or digital quality...it's an alarm clock). The only flaws that I found are the lack of battery backup...not a problem for me because I live on the smae block as a school, so my power never goes out, but I can see how it would be an issue. I was also disappointed to find that the gentle wake feature only applies to the buzzer, not the CD and radio. I believe previous models had this feature for all alarms, and it was a big selling point for me, but my overall satisfaction with the product outweighs my displeasure with this. A great buy for the money. Not quite a Bose, but it is a Sony."
5,Wake up gently..,Wake up gently to the sound of Spanish guitars or your favorite music instead of the alarm buzz that makes you want to throw your alarm clock across the room. This Alarm Clock/ CD player was featured at the Napa Valley Lodge. Now I have that spa feeling at home. I like this model because it does not take up much room on the nightstand as other products.
2,Too complicated and wouldn't play some CDs,"I bought one of these new, because my old Sony Dream Machine was so reliable and simple. At first I was enchanted with all of the features, but setting them up is not intuitive. Eventually I forgot how to program the thing and it wasn't worth the trouble to look it up. Every time the power went out I had to get out the manual to figure out how to reset the time. Then when it started to not play some CDs (factory ones) that was it, and I sold it at a garage sale."
4,Soulfly finally did it!,"I can finally say that Soulfly has releast a great album. Although I will say that alot of the riff's are very Sepultura sounding. It has the creativity that they have been trying to show. The first two albums were worth a listen but they weren't great. This record stays true to their experimentation of tribal metal, but this is one that I would truely recommend."
4,"# 3, finally","This time they're really something: the wallcrushing heaviness gets mixed with a fragile beauty of instrumentals, and - female vocals in the beginning and the end of Tree of Pain; and thrash, being dominant through the cd, easily meets the whole range of music styles and influences: classic rock, latin, nu-metal, and even punk.The indisputable stand-outs are: Seek'n'Strike, One, Tree of Pain, One Nation, Four Elements, and, maybe some more. The four bonus tracks decorate the album nicely, presenting a couple of lives from the Ozzfest'2000.Whatever you have expected from Soulfly, and anything you never have, it's all here, on this cd."
2,I miss the old days,"This is ok I guess kind of (not really) The stuff that is really worth buying though is Morbid Visions/Bestial Devastion, Schizophrenia, Beneath The Remains, Arise and Chaos A.D. The Sacred Reich cover (One Nation) is cool. It can be found on the Sacred Reich e.p. Surf Nicaragua (now there is money well spent). All in all Soulfly 3 is ok, but don't spend any money on it there is a lot better cd's that you need to spend your money on."
3,not bad,compare to the last two album this does not live up to it expectation. primitive was a good and solid album but this one is kinda redundant to what primitive was. so my advice just lent it from a friend
2,Sort of good...... IF......... u own no Sepultura stuff!,"I used to be a Soulfly fan a while ago and even saw the band wen they toured in my area so i do know a bit about them and i'm not slagging them off but..... i checked out some of Max's earlier work with Sepultura and was shocked at how similiar the bands output was, except for the fact that Sepultura sounded fresher. Yup poor Max has spent the last three albums repeating the Roots formula with less and less effect. From awful guest appearences (Limp Bizkit) to ballads (Tree of Pain) and every Soulfly albums complimentary instrumental (always called bloody Soulfly 1,2 etc) this is watered down stuff from the metal god that made such classics like Chaos AD, Arise etc. That being said compared to Adema, Linkin Park etc this is essential stuff but only until you move onto greater things , ie Old Sepultura. Soulfly could be the start of your journey into good metal then....."
2,Sigh...,"I'm giving this two stars. It's a step up from the mundane-ness of Primitive, and the one-minute-long silence called 9-11-01 is touching. However, don't forget that Max Cavalera is the guy that left Sepultura, dyed his dreads pink, collaborated with Fred Durst, and wrote lines like ""F**k Hootie and The Blowfish!"" or ""Bleed! Bleed! Bleed!"" and songs like ""Terrorist"". Not to mention his horrible attempts at rapping. Yikes!At least this album has less rap. However, it also tones down the tribal stuff, making it horribly mundane, and the lyrics still blow.Thank God Sepultura's still out there kickin' butt as usual. I like Derrick Green more and more every time I hear him."
4,"FX50, the good and the bad","A good camera. Small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, it is ready within 2 seconds to take a picture. Pluses: big viewscreen, bright and sharp. Good battery life. Uses SD card. Controls are easy and menus accessible. Pictures are good, but all cameras take good pictures these days.Bad: Optics are limited, no real wide angle, zoom is limited. Has optical image stabilization (as opposed to digital) so it only works with the optical zoom. When you really need stabilization, at extreme zooms, its not there. Has trouble focusing in relatively low light.At $250 it would be a bargain. At $350 it is just one of the crowd."
1,Poor quality all around.,"This microphone has several issues.First of all, since it hangs on your ear, adjusting the microphone is not possible. It will always hang away from your face or sags too low.The second problem is that you need to yell to be heard. Since it hangs away from your face, everything you say is filtered out as background noise until you yell.Finally, it is not comfortable. It hangs loosely, sometimes slips off, and the earpiece does not feel comfortable since it is oval shaped.The standard headset in the 360 package is superior to this. Save your money."
2,A step up but not great..,I really liked the Plantronics X20 for the origional XBOX so i gave this one a try once i got a 360. It is very poorly designed. When you put it on the headset is very loose on the ear and constantly feels like it will fall out while gaming. This becomes very distracting at times. A headset should serve its purpose while allowing the user to forget its there(which the X20 did well). Also the connector seems to fit loosely and has to be pulled out and reinserted every now and then.I gave this a 2 because as stated before its still better than the stock headset... just because that is so uncomfortable. Get an X20 for the 360 if you can find one or get this if its cheap.
1,"Starts off good, but starts to stink","I thought this headset was great when I first got it. It fit securely, and it did not pick up much outside noise in the microphone. I liked it much better than the original 360 headset, and another Plantronics Headset (that I broke).Anyway, like I said, the first month I had this headset, the earpiece sat comfortably and firmly in my ear. However, within the past 2-3 weeks, the rubber piece that keeps the headset attached to the side of your face has gotten REALLY loose. It constantly moves around on my face now, and I can't keep the microphone to stay near my mouth. It drops down all the way to my neck, and people can never hear me.I would defnititely recommend NOT buying this headset. It worked well in the beginning, but in the long run, I would go with something else."
1,Useless microphone.,"Well I bought this to go with my AX360 5.1 headset for the 360 since it would fit under nicely and at first it was alright.Number one issue even though you can rotate the mic it is only in the right position one way. The other way it's sticking out to the side.The incredibly big issue though is the microphone is incredibly horrible. The Xbox can never pick up your voice unless your yelling and even then it's as if your whispering. I think quality control should have picked up on this issue.I tried plugging it into my cell phone and it was incredibly quiet. After a month of use, I finally twisted the mic a bit to much and that was the end of the mic. I found a cell headset for $10 that was much better than this.For all my troubles though I had Plantronics send me another one, just so it could sit in the package. At least I got two crappy headsets for the price of just one in the end."
4,Works well,"I purchased this item as a gift for a family member over 6 months ago. It is still working, and seems to do a better job than the original xbox headset. I can hear chat from this family member better than before. Of course, if the mic is not positioned correctly, it can still be weak, muffled or cut out; however it is not bad. He also said he likes it better than his original headset. The only slight negative that he had was concerning comfort. During long gaming sessions, it starts to make itself known or slip a little. However when comparing to the original xbox headset that came with the console, it is a step up."
5,Plantronics = Great!!!!!!,"My third Plantronics headset in 3 years. I originally bought the gamecom X10's, then upgraded to the gamecom X20's, now I finally bought the X30's. I have to say I love Plantronics headsets and always will. I bought Turtle Beach X1, Turtle beach X31, and Tritton AX 720 over the head headsets. I hate the over the head headsets I find them very uncomfortable. So I bought the X20's then the X30's. I have the x30's as a backup for my wireless Microsoft headset when the wireless headset dies.If your looking for a great headset buy these and you'll be happy with them."
1,Headset VERY VERY bad,"First the mic stem on this headset is VERY short it does not go to your mouth resulting in ALOT of ""Huh? What did you say?"". My friends say it sounds like I'm talking from down a tunnel. Second the mic arm is not flexible, it's rigid and thats all there is to it so if you wanna adjust too bad.I'm extremely dissatisfied with this headset and it broke the second day I had it. So ticked over it I never even sent it back for a refund just pitched the thing in the trash to be rid of it."
2,Doesn't pick up your voice unless you yell into it,"I wanted to like this headset because it fits very well under headphones unlike most of the other products available. However, it just isn't any good.The main problem is that it doesn't pick up your voice unless you talk so loudly that you are basically yelling. And even then it sometimes cuts out while you are still talking.Also the boom on the microphone is not long enough which exacerbates the first problem.Another problem is that it becomes really uncomfortable and starts to hurt your ear after about 20 minutes or so.And finally, the mute/volume control is halfway up the cord and inconvenient to use while playing.One thing I didn't have a problem with was the quality of incoming audio. That was very good, significantly better than the stock 360 headsets."
4,Headset,"Its an okay headset for the price, it gets teh job done, though it starts irritating your ear after a while"
5,Perfect,I love it. its my 3rd one of this kind (as my others stopped working). theyre now the only headsets i can use. its like a wireless headset... but with a wire =P
4,good for me,"It fit my left ear better than my right. The sound is good and I never had any complaints about my voice not being heard. I liked this product, and im replacing mine that was stepped on."
4,Good Headset,I forget that I'm wearing it. Very light and with good sound and mic. Great choice in the limited Xbox 360 headset field.
4,I haven't been this pleased with a purchase in a long while.,"With the retail price being so low and there being a few negative comments already posted about it, I really wasn't expecting much when I purchased the headset. Fortunately, I was wrong. I wore this headset for 4 hours the first day I brought it home with absolutely NO discomfort. I definitely recommend this! Check the Customer's picture for commentary about the fit."
4,Plantronics headset for Xbox 360,"This Plantronics headset is decent. The headset that is included with the Xbox 360 is pretty much garbage. I picked up this headset because of it's name and design.The sound quality is a little better then the quality from the 360 headset. The design takes a little getting used to. Sometimes I think that it might fall out of my ear but it hasn't yet. The one thing I don't like about it is the inline volume/mute control box. You have to take your hand off of the controller midgame to turn down the volume or mute/unmute yourself. This doesn't work well when I'm playing Halo 2 or GRAW.Overall, I'm happier about this headset then I was about the Microsoft headset."
2,Don't Buy This,"I purchased this headset because it seemed to have a reasonable price, that was it. It is comfortable in my opinion, and doesn't feel like it could fall off at all. The sound comes in very clear, but my complaint is that it is EXTREMELY difficult to communicate to others. The mic is connected to a hard-plastic straw that doesn't bend toward the mouth, and the only way that I could get the mic to pick up my voice was to either yell or take one hand off my controller in order to push the mic closer to my mouth to talk. I've been using the headset that came with my Xbox 360 instead, and I think it is a very good headset, considering it came with my Xbox 360 for free."
3,Comfortable and convenient,"I MUCH prefer this headset over the stock headset that comes with the 360. however, I wish they would've kept the on-plug mute switch instead of putting it in-line where I have to stop and look at it to switch it off."
2,Not good headset,"I purchased this headset after the one that came with the xbox broke... Do not buy this headset, buy an overear one. This one is hard to get into your ear, very uncomfortable, and goes so far into your ear and gets covered by my brother's ear wax... Also, the mic is not that sensitive, and my friends can not hear a thing I say online. You can;t even bend the mic towards your mouth!DO NOT BUY IT!! GET AN OVEREAR VERSION!!!***This is an update***Just yesterday, the mic started going bad. My voice is fuzzy... I wish I could give this a negative rating.once again DO NOT GET THIS HEADSET!!!"
3,Meh....,"Slightly better than the one microsoft gives you, but a little more expensive. If you have a working microsoft mic don't upgrade to this one. It really isn't worth it unless you abosolutely need a mic."
2,So disappointing,"I purchased this headset as a replacement for my stock Xbox 360 comm. unit.The standard headset that comes with the 360 puts pressure above my ear and causes me to get headaches. I thought the under the ear design was the perfect answer. The fit is comfortable (although the ear bud rotates a bit too easily), and the incoming audio is great; however, the mic is horrible. My friends could not hear me at all unless I was almost shouting and sometimes not even then. I would not recommend this headset to anyone. I replaced it with another Plantronics model:Xbox 360 Over Ear Headsetwhich works great and is much more comfortable for me than the standard Microsoft headset."
3,Okay,I have small ears and this product was just very unconfortable to me. You have to shove piece pretty deep to keep it secure. It feels very loose and falls out in my ear. When using this on the xbox or regular phone the sound is low. It just broke on me after a year and a half.
3,paper bunches up,paper bunches up when using for hand sanding. Product is very suitable for hand work especially in tight or small curves.
2,DVS ISSUES - BIRTHDAY GIRL DISAPPOINTED,"I WAS SO EXCITED FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER TO RECEIVE THE FREE WILLY COLLECTION DVD. IT WAS HER 6TH BIRTHDAY AND SEE LOVES THE FREE WILLY MOVIES, ESPECIALLY THE 1ST ONE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE FIRST AND SECOND FREE WILLY MOVIES BOTH SKIP AND SHE IS UNABLE TO WATCH THEM. IT IS SO INCONVINENT TO HAVE TO SEND THE DVD BACK AND WOULD COST ME MORE THAN WHAT I SPENT ON THE DVD ITSELF, SO I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED."
5,Free Willy,"I saw the fist movie a long time ago, when I saw it at Amazon in a 4 pack I send for it. I saw it with my two grand children and we loved it. I recommend it, it's a beautiful family movie. I know you would enjoy..."
5,The best of the best,"This album contains some of the most moving and inspirational lyrics ever laid to track. In this album we are inspired to seek after God and to serve Him with all we have. This is not just another ""lukewarm"" attempt at Christian music. SCC heart and message come through. This album (and the Bible study that accompinied it on the tour) are incredible vehicles to turn our hearts toward God. From the title cut to Busy Man to When You Are A Soldier, the Holy Spirit uses this album to challenge a lukewarm faith. WHAT KIND OF JOY is the type of song the Lord uses in your life to remind you that service to Him is not always easy but is always worth it. No Christian album collection is complete without the materpiece! Buy it today!"
1,Not Stainess Steel,"This set is not surgical stainless steel construction, it is nickel plated, according to Wusthof's catalog. It is still a decent product, but not what it claimed to be in the description."
2,Ok just ok,Works ok just don't seem as hard as previous dress stones I have had. Plastic holder does not hold stone very tight
2,poor economy,"I bought this dresser without realizing that it was a solid material that would dissipate rather rapidly. While it did do a good job of cleaning up a couple of my grinding wheels, (maybe it's only for very fine abrasives) in any case it's now half-way used up.... not very practical - I should of just bought new wheels. Dave"
4,DOS still Rocks!,"I played this game until I wore out the floppy disks (that's right, proper floppies) back in the 90s. Since then I've compared my memories of this game to all new game purchases. Definitely a fantastic game if you have a way to play it. Very Indiana Jones in the plot structure and the seagull poop scene remains one of the funniest scenes ever."
4,"A fine new writer, looking forward to more!","For a novel based on harsh realism, I found the character of Tina to be sureal. Mid-way, she filled many pages and I became bored with her situation. By the end, I decided that if she had been omitted entirely, she wouldn't have been missed. On the other hand, Aunt Mattie and Uncle Tom had the potential to be very strong characters, not only in the lives of Darlene and the children but most especially for Earl, for whom I felt some sympathy. He struck me as being mean and cold simply for the sake of not knowing any better. Mattie came on the scene too late, and in my opinion, dumped a lot of revelations and insight into the story that (at that point) was already complex. She was distracting when I wanted to focus on the other characters - I found myself wondering ""where have you been? why now?"". Overall, I really liked this novel and look forward to future work by this author. Highly recommended."
2,Exhausting narrative of backwoods poverty.,"If you're looking for a new Jane Hamilton, Bobbie Ann Mason, or Dorothy Allison, this is NOT your author. Although, the premise is similar to the trailer trash topics of the aforementioned writers, this book is a depressing anthem of weather and geography vs. the human spirit. There are only so many times a character can be kicked when they are down until the reader wants them to stay down."
3,Train Wreak,"You know how you slow down when you drive by a traffic accident, and turn your head to gawk at the cars; well that's how I looked at this book. Dalia Pagani does an amazing job developing her characters, but she had so many of them going in this book, that you never really have a feeling for any one of them. She also goes off on some really strange ideas in regard to the outdoors world. I won't even bring up my feelings about how she prorated the Rural Vermont persona. If you are one of those people who likes to look at other people's misery, you'll probably enjoy this book, other wise maybe you should look the other way when you drive by the mangles cars."
4,Great set Especially for A Gift,I usually by bbq the end of the season when it is 75% off. Like this was. After getting one for me I ordered two more when they sent me the review this form. My friends will think I am a big spender.
4,Awesome,"What a killer deal!! Everything is well constructed and heavy. The grill tongs are going to take some practice because they are so much stronger than I am :) So far I totally recommend this product, we have however only used one item (only had it for 2 days)."
5,Fits great,This fits exactly like OEM for my 98 Corolla. Quality is excellent and price is better than Toyota. Good stuff.
5,The Rolex Report,"This is a ""MUST HAVE"" for any Rolex owner or anyone thinking of buying one.The information provided is extremely comprehensive, everything you could possibly want to know, and more !Printed on Top quality paper, with superb macro photography, it's the best forty bucks I've spent in years.Especially helpful to anyone who suspects their Rolex might be fake...you now know what to look for!"
2,Just for the people that had never put a Rolex in their hand,"The book does not cover in depth Rolex history. In fact, it does not cover the modern line (where's information of the still made Rolex Air King series?). All the pictures are in black and white format.It's a book for the ones that had never put a real rolex in their hands and cannot notice a diference between the fake and the real one.For Rolex story and models, i recomend James Dowling book (more expensive); to learn how to distinguish a fake Rolex from a real one, a recomend looking at the real ones to compare."
3,A little disappointed,I purchased this book because of good reviews from other buyers. I was a little disappointed. Although it covers a good range of topics about Rolex; the information is a bit dated - even though it says it is a new revision. Some of the information and prices have clearly not been brought up to date for a number of years. It is still a fairly good source of information if one wants to look at some of the older models. All I can say is I am sure glad I didn't pay the full retail price for it.
3,Nice Cover,Black and white photos. Has Ebay buying advice. Save your money and buy it used. The cover is the most attractive part of the book.
3,Good book for Rolex collector.,"Great book for Rolex collector. Slow on the shipping, but thats not the publishers fault.Nice pictures, although all balck & white."
4,do you have a rolex? buy this book!,"very informative and good book about rolex watches and their history, especially about fakes und originals! do you have a real one- buy the book!"
3,Emile Venter,"I found this book very interesting. I mostly enjoyed the content. The only complaints I have are the following:1. All photographs are in black and white.2. There are some pretty nasty grammatical and/or spelling errors that should not show up in a book that is otherwise well written.3. There are a few mistakes, mostly text incorrectly identifying watches in certain photographs.I was slightly disappointed with the book, but am still glad I bought it. The book mostly deals with ways to identify fake Rolex watches and as such does not give the full history of the various Rolex models. Even so, the book contains a great deal of interesting and useful information. If you're a real Rolex ""afficionado"", it is still good value for money."
5,Don't get e-...... Buy this Book !,"This is the best Rolex book I have ever read!!! It cuts through the [stuff], and gets straight to the point! Tons of valuable information, without all the fluff you find in those OVER PRICED ""coffee table"" books. The comparison pics of counterfeits are the best I have seen. I can't imagine buying a Rolex without this book!!"
5,All you need to know,... and some more. Very good book about truth and rumors surrounding Rolex. For collectors or people how are just interested in Rolex a MUST.
4,newbee,"I am new to the world of watch collecting, so I learned allot about Rolex. I am primarily interested in this brand, so if you are like me I believe this is a good book."
2,I tried to like this book...,"I loved Kathryn Harrison's ""The Kiss."" It was a compelling and gorgeously written book about something absolutely unspeakable. I was so excited for this book when I started it. And the language is again, very beautiful. But, I found the structure confusing and unnecessarily complicated. She shifts back and forth in time with complete abandon, and it got to the point where I didn't care enough about the plot and the characters to go back and clarify any questions. I think the story has great potential for a wonderful book, but it needs a simpler treatment than the one it is given here."
3,interesting story but muddled ending.....,"I had read POISON and THE KISS by Kathryn Harrison, and really enjoyed POISON in particular. I was intrigued by the story she was writing of in THE BINDING CHAIR, and picked it up anticipating a mix of social criticism and historical drama.The book started out promisingly enough. However, the last few chapters when Mai is old and reminiscing about her early days, left me wondering where the author was leading the reader. The ending was strange, and it didn't seem to fit the book's intention. The author seemed to dash off a tragic ending, without giving it any development or real resolution.An OK read with a disappointing end...."
1,Vocabulary Builder,This book was a good vocabulary builder if read with a dictionary close at hand. The story was disjointed and disappointing.
4,Caught between two worlds,"This is the story of the beautiful May-li as she struggles desperately to live behind her Eastern culture and become more Westernized. Her bound feet make this impossible as they are a constant reminder of her true heritage.This story is painfully beautiful and the images drawn linger long after the book has ended. If you are looking for infomation on the ancient custom of foot binding, this is not the book for you. This book is about self-denial, and incredible pain. We never truly lose hope until May does and we find ourselves wishing for just a little more time."
3,Needed a good editor,"As the others have written in their reviews, I found the book trying to do too many things and failing to tightly weave all together. Characters come and go, even entering comparatively late in the story, but aren't fully developed. Even May,the protagonist, becomes a confusing mass of artificiality and repressed motives.However, if you read the novel more as a travelogue it succeeds because of its many sharply drawn vignettes (such as traveling on a train through Russia, living in infected Shanghai during the great pandemic of 1918). And this is a book that sends the reader for more information: I surfed the internet for several hours finding articles on foot binding in China."
2,Tepid,"A strangely listless novel by the author of The Kiss. Thewriting is stilted with some typically florid passages about lakes ofblood, etc. Expect the usual taboo father-daughter stuff, but with a Sino-Russian twist. Despite the multiple plot lines, there's little suspense. The characters are paint-by-numbers except for a lithping math wiz who seems cousin to Colin Harrison's bombshell math wiz in Afterburn. The sex scenes are bloody awful, though not as awful as the bionic sex scenes in Afterburn. The utterly predictable ending confirms that the novel's basically a Kate Chopin re-hash, so why not re-read The Awakening instead? It's a much better book."
5,Smart & Sexy,"Maybe the best book I read all summer. This novel absolutely transported me - I couldn't put it down. It reminded me a little of _Memoirs of a Geisha_, another book I found myself rivetted to. Harrison's _The Binding Chair_ combines a good story, original and unpredictable, with good storytelling, making her language as sensual as the main character, May's, crippled feet and the soft, damaged skin wrapped in gauzey bandages. The shock of the book is equalled only by its subtlety, resisting the urge to make simple political statements or moral judgments, but revealing the complexity and complicity present in any system of oppression. Unlike, for instance, Anna Quindlen's _Black and Blue_, this novel does not turn out how you expect, instead turning this way and that in seductive narrative moves in every chapter. I liked it far better than _The Kiss_, her memoir, which seemed less skilled in handling controversial content."
2,Like being in an opium haze...,"Kathryn Harrison writes with beautifully flowing cinematic language, but that wasn't enough to retain my interest in this book. She spreads the narrative too thinly over several characters, and I had to forcibly prevent myself from skipping chapters that didn't have May-li (the central character) in them. While I appreciate the need to retain an air of mystery about the protagonist, the smoky haze surrounding this book caused drowsiness and a growing sense of dissatisfaction. Even the sexual shock tactics failed to distract after the umpteenth description of the metaphorical round peg being forced into the square hole. The book displayed so much imagination and skill, but so little direction."
2,Emancipate Me!,"To be honest, I was glad when I finally finished this book. The first few chapters I found interesting, especially when telling of May-li and her life. However, I thought the narrative was choppy when it kept jumping back and forth through time, and introducing dubious characters of little interest or involvement to the story.I enjoyed the introduction to the cultural aspects of Shanghai and the curious (almost fetishistic) ritual of foot-binding.I enjoyed Ms. Harrison's ""Poison"" much more and would recommend it over ""The Binding Chair""."
2,Not enjoyable at all,"Was the author in a hurry? Did she enjoy writing this book, or did she take out her press for time and/or obligatory book release deadline on the characters in this book? The storyline is incredibly unbelievable and unrealistic. Why did I finish the book? I ask myself the same question. Perhaps because I kept hoping for some sense to arrive in the storyline. When I reached the last page, I could only shake my head with disappointment...and I promptly added the book to the box for charity instead of making room for it on my personal library shelf."
3,Somewhat of a letdown,"Although the author starts very strongly, she is unable to keep it going throughout the course of the story. The descriptions of turn of the century China are nothing short of enthralling. But, there are a couple of faults later in the novel: some extremely graphic (and out of place) sexual imagery that contributes absolutely nothing to the plot, and a climax that rings trite and hollow. Amy Tan does this subject much better...."
4,Atrocities painted in pretty butterfly slippers,"After the first part of this book, I put it away, sat it down and wasn't sure if I wanted to pick it up again. The painful and constant violation of females scared me. How could it be that Chinese female children suffered the abuse of having their feet broken and folded so that they would have even smaller feet. May suffered the excrusiating pain with promise of reward, a husband who would love her. Instead the pain and violence only contintued as the fourth wife of her older abusive husband, she was constantly raped, sodomized and beaten. There was no reward. That seems to be the theme of this book. Suffering only leads to more, light seemingly put out at the end of this tunnel. A sad quiet story that still haunts me."
3,A mixed bag,"I enjoyed the first few chapters of this novel, but after a while the relentless shock tactics grew tedious. I disagree with one reviewer's comment, that Harrison avoids being political. Almost all the Chinese characters in this are sadistic and barbaric. While I don't doubt that the practice of wife beating, the torture of the girl in the marketplace and the practice of footbinding were commonplace in their culture, I'm not sure why Harrison couldn't have put in any positive aspects of Chinese culture to give a less one sided view. Instead we are left with the colonnial view that all Chinese at the turn of the century were savages and if that isn't a political point I don't know what is!Harrison's prose is breathtaking and she is an enormously talented writer. However, my gripe with this is that the non linear plot did not hold my attention and the ending was a dissapointment."
2,Um... well....,"I picked up the Binding Chair after reading Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. I was hoping to read another excellent story about China and its customs. What I got with the Binding Chair was a 2nd rate book that couldn't seem to find it groove, let alone stay on track with the story. A disappointing read, I struggled to finish the book... read any of the books by Lisa See instead."
3,Memoirs fair to 'middling,"It's a good read, but documentation/verification of claims is lacking....which leaves the reader looking for more. If the author cannot 'put up', she should have kept it as a novel."
4,Interesting Monologue,"I read many good things about this book. I'd say that I was 90% satisified ... the lacking coming from perhaps too high expectations after having read several of the other reviews.One thing I would like to come to more knowledge about, is if this book comes from a real story or a realistic story. Either way, it gives a unique insight on ways which the modern world attacks Holy Mother Church. The actual implication is found only sparcely in the book -- however the ideas for destroying the truth in the Church abound. It is well worth the read, as it flows fast and you should finish it in one or two days.If you liked this book, you may like ""Against the Heresies"" by Archbishop Lefebvre. The one caution, however, is an arguable excommunition he inflicted onto himself for ordaining four bishops outside of papal approval in 1988."
2,Work of fiction,"I think this is a work of fiction. It is true that the communists infiltrated the Catholic Church at all levels, especially behind the iron curtain. But I doubt their propaganda extended to moderist heresies in the West, there is no evidence of this. The words are only those of the author who was rightly upset at the loss of faith among the clergy and religious after Vatican II.Second point, if you hated the narrow emotional and intellectual range of Dostoyevsky's characters, you will not like this book either."
2,bad soap opera,"After reading aa-1025 the author goes out of her way to hide all means to reaserch her book.Why does a suppose catholic hide the work of a non believer?anti christian 3/4 of the book is a love affair with raven hair another person of interest that she wont reveal hmm something to hide, nothing has changed in the church the bible still states the church will never fail. we fail the church i looked at it as a bad soap opera"
5,One of the most important books you could ever read!,"This book is a shocking eye-opener, about how the communists have infiltrated the Catholic church and how they destroy the dogma. Most people don't know how damaging communism has been to the Church, but you'll know why the Holy Father keeps denouncing communism all the time after you read this book. Also, the Fatima prophesy takes on a whole new meaning after reading this book.More information along these lines can be found by reading Father Malachi Martin's books."
4,Fun,"I loved watching sci-fi/horror movies as a child, and this is one that I remember fondly. Great fun to watch with my own kids now."
3,Above-average giant bug film,"The Monster that Challenged the World (1957), directed by Arnold Laven and starring Tim Holt, Audrey Dalton and Hans Conried, is an above-average grade-B film about giant, mutated mollusks from the bottom of the Salton Sea. The action takes place in the vicinity of a naval base commanded by Tim Holt, with Conried the navy scientist who provides all the explanations. The huge creatures, mutated as a result of radioactivity from atomic testing and freed after millions of years thanks to earthquake activity, drain the body fluids out of their victims. Yuk. Above-average special effects, interesting story, and convincing acting combine to make this film one of the best of its type. Highly recommended to fans of the genre."
3,A monster movie actually about Escargot,"This is a good little movie; it reminded me of the old ""Thing From Another World"" from the same decade, in that it had several realistic and normal-sounding characters, which made the fantastic goings-on a little more believable. The monsters are pretty good, too, as long as you don't expect anything TOO fabulous. This MGM ""Midnite Movies"" DVD is- according to the packaging- released in the ""standard"" format, but no real cropping of the image (sharp and clear, by the way) was apparent, so maybe there ISN'T a letterbox variation available even if you wanted one. Not all movies in the 50's were filmed in widescreen, after all. I won't complain about the lack of extras (there aren't any, not even a trailer!), as if you shop around you can get this DVD pretty cheap. Chalk this one up as yet another inexpensive, modest pleasure from the growing MGM ""Midnite Movies"" series. Keep 'em coming!"
5,BEST OF GIANT BUG MOVIES FROM 1950S,"FROM THE OPENING CREDITS ""MTCTW"" EMBODIES ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT MAKE IT THE PREMIER GIANT SNAIL MOVIE OF THE 1950S. IT WAS SHOCKING IN IT'S TIME AND CAUSED MANY A DAMP MOVIE SEAT WHEN THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THE DRAINED SKULL APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS, SOUND ACTING AND ATMOSPHERIC DIRECTION ELEVATE THIS MOVIE ABOVE THE LOW BUDGET REST."
5,One Of Benjamin's Favorites,"This is easily one of Benjamin's (4 years old) favorites. He loves to imitate the giant slugs as he slowly ambles about the room, making mouth pinchers with his fingers, and croaking out the breathy the ""hooo-haaa"" sound from the movie. Pure optimistic 50's SF where no problem can't be overcome if we just work together. And what science can't overcome, the army can just blow up."
3,Bland monster B movie,"Former cowboy movie star Tim Holt walks through this one like a man on his way to his execution. This is a formulaic, bland, dull creature feature with every stereotypical '50's monster cliche included. Radioactivity! Giant (fill in the blank!), etc. The monster is not at all scary. Only for nostalgia/kitsch lovers."
3,Killer Critters,"You're not likely to be frightened by MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD, but as 1950s sci-fi/horror programmers go it is better than most. The story, which resembles everything from THEM! to THE THING to BLACK LAGOON, concerns prehistoric eggs that are irradiated by atomic blast and then released by earthquake into a saltwater sea by a military station--where several military men go missing as a result.The cast, script, story, and monster are all okay but nothing special and never rise above the ""B Movie"" level, but the movie is an enjoyable way to spend a rainy evening. It's also mild enough for use as a ""family night"" film with older kids, and would be a good way to introduce them to the genre without giving them fits; younger kids, however, will either be bored or genuinely frightened, so you might want to prescreen it just in case."
5,Fresh and Better Than Before,"The songs are brighter, deeper and better than the original recordings. This remix elegantly show cases Rex Smith's rich, strong, and versatile musical performance.Teri Raes"
1,ow ow ow ow....it hurts!!!,"Wow, this movie is just plain horrible. Watching it is like taking in a slow, painful train wreck.You should watch it, just to say you tried."
4,Campy 60's Scifi,"I liked this flick, fun campy 60's scifi for a rainy day, definitely could have been featured on mystery science theater, has a good pace, kept my interest, it was funny watching every other scene switch back and forth from daytime to night time, especially when the whole movie was supposed to take place in 24hours, but I found this movie an entertaining bit of bygone B scifi history."
2,An exploitation movie,"No they are not exploiting women; they are exploiting Tommy Kirk. Filmed in Texas it may have worked if they had got the so to be governor Kinky Freedman instead.Looks like mars has ran out of ""Y""; ""Why because we like you."" No not that ""Y"" the ""Y"" chromosome. Hence the lack of female companion ship. So they first try is pilfering with a transponder. All they get leftovers. Looks like they will just have to go in person to pick the ideal subjects.Will Martian Fellow #1 (Tommy Kirk) gain a conscious before the movie ends?"
1,Mindless entertainment for a rainy Saturday,"""What is it? What's the message? Is it a message? What does it mean?""""It's only three words.... Mars Needs Women""Well there you go, how's that for a plot? In the tradition of horrible 1960's B horror movies, this one is down with the Mushroom People, Sub-par Frankenstein movies, and King Kong versus Godzilla.Anyway Mars needs to repopulate the planet because all their females died from a 'sickness'. They contact Earth and offer to purchase some, but of course our brave, nerdy scientists refuse. So now Mars is planning on an invasion to kidnap some earthly mates. I won't give away the ending, but you'll probably fall asleep half way through it and not even care. This was just bad. Not campy bad mind you, just bad."
2,... but do we need this movie?,"I am a fan of SF B-movies but this is a rather dull one. I tried hard to keep my eyes open <yawn>. If, then it's only worth because of the X-15 and other airplanes stock footages and of (Batgirl) Yvonne Craig. At least the DVD is a bargain."
2,Good to see Tommy Kirk,"It is good to see Tommy Kirk working in a film, but not exactly this film. Pretty sad movie and industry to use the likes of once great teenage actor, Disney's Tommy Kirk, in this type of film. Tommy Kirk is an actor who just got too old for his own image. That is sad. This movie is sad or should I just say bad."
5,Great product,Great movie! I love collecting and watching these old sci-fi movies and I hope these types of movies will continue to be offered.
4,Good B-Sci-fi Movie,Is Tommy Kirk wasted here? Yes.Is this poorly filmed and directed? Yes.Is this a good B sci-fi movie? Yes.
5,Excellent book!,"This book was extremely well written. You actually feel as if you are in Egypt with Joseph. A great deal of reseach must have been done for this novel, the details and the historical elements were fantastic. This is a great read for everybody, even non-religious readers. Be sure you reserve time to read this, because you won't be able to put it down!"
2,So-So,"I was disappointed in this book, thinking it would have more to do with traditional possession. What the author writes about has more to do with blaming ghosts for every ill that befalls man. It got to be a bit much for me when the author blames alcoholism on the ghosts of previous alcoholics. The book does have some interesting theories, and some I can see being reasonable, but there are so many over the top theories here that I just couldn't finish it."
5,Heartbreaking...,"Anyone who has lost someone to AIDS should read this book. It's funny, sad, charming and heartbreaking. After reading this, you feel you have made, then lost, a new friend."
4,we love Rolie Polie Olies,My 15 month daughter and 3 year old niece love this video. The shapes and colors are great. It was hard to put away until next October!
2,"OK, but not a great design","I bought 3 of these a few months ago to run several 220V devices off of 110V lines.Two devices I was using are suppose to draw only 200 watts. Although the converters are rated for 230 watts, both converters blew out when running these devices. I do not understand why the converters do not contain a fuse or circuit breaker to prevent this.The third device apparently draws far less than 200 watts, and its converter is functioning fine."
1,Complicated and Incomplete,"There are a few different templates that come with the kit all of them have been a pain. The first template is a rotor-copter like machine that does not come with a straw(which is the center part of the contraption). This does not sound bad, but when no straw that I could find would fit well or not bend under he pressure of the rubber band, it turns into a big deal. The airplanes flew well, but were a little of a pain due to the cheap double sided tape that they provide. I do not recommend this product to anyone. It is better to just look up how to construct paper airplanes online!"
3,"Nice, but don't get your hopes overly high","I bought this toy for my 5yo son. He needed some assistance in setting it up, especially the rubber band in the ""helicopter"". He and his 8yo brother enjoyed the ""helicopter"", but the paper airplanes were not much different from what you can do by folding paper.Overall, it is a nice kit, but don't set you expectations too high."
4,mirka sanding discs,"For the most part, it is a great product. I have used 3 boxes and the discs last along time and are very durable, but the last box the little piece of plastic between the discs did not come off very easy, making it difficult at times."
5,Great Pan!,"I bought this pan so I can make my son's birthday cake for his 1st birtday party. It worked out great! When you make it, it seems smaller, but it can actually feed plenty of people. I also liked that you can make it into any animal you'd like so your kids won't get tired of the same teddy bear cake."
4,Cute and useful.,"We gave this as a birthday present. The gentleman who received it was happy with the set. The oven mitt is a little small, and not very thick. It works all right though. The apron is of good size and seemed very durable."
5,High quality for a good price,It does exactly what I needed it to do. The price is very good and trhe quality is even better. You won't be disappointed.
5,Another Porter Cable Favorite,"The local woodworking store closed it's doors last year. Amazon is now the best place I have found to buy this product. Like the other reviews I have left, this product is also very good quality. All my woodworkers rate this their top requested gift. It has been explained to me the sand stays stuck longer."
2,"poorly laid out book, annoying CD","The layout of the book is confusing. Too much space is wasted on pictures, and when words are superimposed on pictures, it is sometimes hard to decipher the words. Additionally, the pictures are not all that helpful. For example, the word ""restrooms"" points to the roof of a building.(p.63)The CD wastes time repeating the same instructions (""Listen to the words and repeat in the pauses..""). It would have been more helpful to eliminate the instructions--or only have instructions for the first two or three lessons, and use that time to repeat the word or phrase after the pause. They also feel it necessary to include sound effects, like a phone's busy signal and restaurant background noise--another waste of time and space.The only positive is the book is small and there is a limited dictionary in the back, so you can take it with you when you travel."
2,The Windows-XP write-protection problem,"I've experienced exactly the same problem with my drive: most often Windows XP says the drive was write-protected - although the drive doesn't have any write-protection mechanism at all. I'm really frustrated! I've sent an email to Iomega on the support page - they immediately sent a new device to me, without even asking me further about the problem. I got that new drive before I had to send back my apparently defect one and it didn't cost me anything. So far, very good customer support, but ... the new drive doesn't work and Windows XP gives me exactly the same error message. I tried the drive in several computers with several different XP versions (SP1, SP2) and always experienced the same problem. Don't buy this drive!"
2,"Drive works well, but Windows XP...","This is a wonderful little product (provided it doesn't fall off the cheap ""keychain"" or slip out of the plastic sleeve). The main problem I encountered is with good old Windows XP. On my work PC (a Compaq), the device works like a charm. On my home laptop (Dell Inspirion), Window's insists on treating the device as ""read only"" and will not allow you to save any files to the product. I've been through Iomega's online chat help, to no avail. Given the buggy operations of Windows XP in general, and adding on the differences in manufcaturers installation of XP, conflicts with resident memory programs such as anti-virus or firewall programs, even a simple product like this can frustrate!"
5,the Incredible Hulk second season is pretty good!,"The Incredible Hulk second season is pretty good! I like the second season of the Incredible Hulk TV series. Bill Bixby is great as Dr. David Banner and Lou Ferrigno is great as the Incredible Hulk! After seeing some of theese episodes, I started to be upset because Bill Bixby is gone. He died in 1993 from prostate cancer. He was very talented. I don't think anyone could play Dr. David Banner Better than him. RIP Bill Bixby. Also thie Incredible Hulk TV show was done in the late 1970s. Many things in this DVD set reflect the 1970s era. Highly Recommended! A-"
3,Two really good episodes,"I'm a big fan who was ""traumatised"" as a kid by Banner's Hulk-outs. For this reason, I can watch each show with a certain fascination.For non-fans, the only two good episodes are Married and Mystery Man. The remaining shows are only average.It has to be said though that Bill Bixby is a wonderful actor and really carried the show in places.Do pick this collection up if you're a fan!!"
5,Incredible Hulk Season 2,Just to let everyone know who is getting this set they are including a bonus episode of Homecoming from season 3.I agree with what other reviewers said.Season 2 was the strongest season.
4,excellent,"I'm a fan of the series.Season 2 is good, although season 3 is much better (in my opinion)!"
1,Buyer beware!,"I just bought The Incredible Hulk, the complete second season. Well, it's NOT complete. There are some episodes missing from the DVD discs, that were listed on the outside of the DVD cases. Needless to say, I feel ripped-off.I contacted the seller about this issue, and hopefully I'll get a refund. Because of the missing episodes, I wouldn't recommendpurchasing The Incredible Hulk, the 'complete' second season."
5,hulk fan,"Second Season is argubly the strongest. The episodes deal with social issues such as terminal illness, mental illness, alcohol, child abuse, and race. Some of best episodes from season two are A Child In Need, Alice In Discoland, Killer Instinct, The Haunted, Married and Mystery Man.I look forward to the release of this in July."
1,Barrage,"I actually did not even listen to this CD. I thought it was the other John Stevens when I ordered it, and after reading - or starting to read - the liner notes, I decided I was sorry I even opened it. I would rate it zero stars if I had the option."
3,"Cuba Gooding Jr, as least he's trying...","If you have sometime to waste, go for it and take time to watch this if you like the cover. Mr Gooding trying get back into the beat of things, but needs to pick better projects, scripts. You can help thinking while watching this movie, him screaming ""show me the money!"", which I'm sure in this case, wasn't much there."
3,Fair,"Great actors, storyline is a little predictable. Good popcorn eating movie, put your brain on pause. I got what I thought when purchasing this DVD but my rating was on point."
2,A good give-away,Reminds me of the stuff we used to see on Saturday afternoon back in the 40's and 50's - I gave mine away.
2,Unlikely,"This movie was fine for passing the time, but there was not much thought put into the plot. If you have nothing else to do, this movies was an alternate choice to summer reruns."
2,does not hit the target,"A hit man (Gooding) is supposed to take out some baddies in Prague with a big gun he shoots from a block away. (Sniper) We are told who the people are as their names and position are flashed up on the screen, like inBurn Notice: Season One. Turns out that the shooters want shot other mob folks-thinkThe Godfather, this all takes place in Prague but everybody speaks English and there is some American $.One guy gets away because he holds a gal in front of him and Gooding doesn't want to shoot a gal. Ahh. So, the other group hires Dolph. Of course they meet and battle. A gal from Gooding's past appears and is used as bait. Big shoot-out and everybody lives happily ever after. How these guys seem to walk through walls and not get hit by a shower of hot lead is not explained. Stinker, pass. Drink, smoke, swear."
3,See it only for Dolph!,"This movie was just average and I dont buy Cuba as an assassin either. But Dolph was fun to watch, this was one of his best roles but not as fun and over the top as his character in Universal Soldier, but still fun. Believe it or not I actually would like to see a sequel to this movie (Once you get to the end youll see what Im talking about). Other than Dolph, no other reason to see this film."
3,sorry Dolph,"Action packed, but poorly cast. Dolf Lundgren had a miserable part. A drunken ex-Soviet hitman who was nearly unstoppable. Walking about in a left over Magnum Aloha shirt while drinking and shooting everybody was less fun then I thought. he's done much better work. Think he'd learn by now, since he's also in production and script writing. I hope the day comes he finds his mark again."
5,A classic in origami book and must-have for serious folders!,"If you are not satisfied with those ""follow me"" origami books, and if you are very interested in how the origami designers design their own models, this book will provide the answer. The book begins on a long, superb essay about origami theory,then discusses the similarity of origami and other art, then unveils the secrets of the progress of creating new models. AND, what follows are 24 wonderful models, some of them are so hard that even a veteran will find it almost impossible. This is not for beginners,but for those who consider origami is really an art."
5,A brilliant book intended for hardcore aficionados,"This is the most challenging origami book I have ever seen. Although I have grown up with origami and consider myself very experienced, I am still not able to complete some of the models near the end of the book.The models near the end of the book require huge and very thin paper. You will need paper that is at least several feet to a side.But I still say this book is a must-have for intermediate and advanced folders. Engel's folding style is very unique in the world of origami. Works like the rattlesnake and the caterpillar use original and unusual folding methods to obtain amazing results. The works are all very enjoyable to fold."
2,Model diagrams hard to understand,This book is problably better suited for the very advanced enthusiast. The diagrams are very hard to follow and there are way too many tucks of unnecessary paper flaps.
5,Very pleased with the quality of this book!,"I recently read a positive review of Created By in a Hollywood trade paper and it encouraged me to buy this book. Created By is a quick read that flowed extremely well.Prigge asked some very worthwhile questions and certainly rounded up a variety of show creators that is sure to impress anyone (Larry David, Alan Ball, Ilene Chaiken, etc.). While many books out there in this genre only cover drama or sitcom, this book covers both mediums as well as TV shows that air on network and cable. That was a nice suprise and it made the book third-dimensional. I am not a professional writer, just a fan of good television. I always TIVO the shows Will & Grace, The L Word, Fat Actress and The OC. I was soooo happy to be able to read about all these shows under one cover. Finally, money well spent!"
5,This book was a big help!,I had an idea for a television show and I decided that I wanted to write the pilot script. I looked for a book that would let me know the key ingredients on how to execute my idea from conception to paper. I ordered four books and I have to say that Created By beat the others out by miles. I want to thank the author for writing this book in such a clever format. It was a big help!
4,Candid Review,"This book is a very candid review from show runners. It's not a ""how to"" book about getting into the business, but it does gives you valuable information."
4,VERY COOL BOOK,"This book is very cool. The author asked some great questions, and the fact that he got all of these A-list show creators under one cover is amazing."
2,"OK, but not great","I bought this to homeschool my 4th grader. I have some of the other Complete Book of... books, and this is my least favorite. I am having to find library books and online material to suppliment everything. This might work for things like extra credit activities, but it isn't really working out for us as a main source of science material like I had hoped."
2,I say: make your own flash cards or use an exercise book,"I honestly don't think that by making a big bulky book with so-called ""flash cards"" is the solution to improving your skills. Of course I may be wrong and wouldn't want to discourage you from trying this out (any practice is better than no practice), but I do think there are better ways to exercise your Italian.First of all, the pages are laid out as large flash-cards (not cut, of course), so you're looking at only 3 cards on each page that may be questions on grammar rules, vocabulary, verbs, etc. The answers of course are on the back.I do think this is an extreme waste of page space (and paper). The book is hard to go through, it's not easy to reference a particular section, which could've been made easier if they had made it as a spiral-book. I really don't know how someone can use this book quickly and effectively. I don't get it.Why not just purchase a simple exercise book instead?"
2,flamingo seranade,one song is original. the rest ? i don't know. has alot of the flamingos old songs but they just don't sound like the flamingos.
2,Flamingo CD,"Quality of the CD was very low. Sound was far below origanal, sounds like it was a copy of a copy of a copy. I do not think I would purchase another from this company."
1,Conditioner is fantastic BUT.....,"Do not buy it from fragrancenet if that is the seller that shows up. I love this conditioner and am willing to spend a pretty penny on it - however, the conditioner I received when ordering it online from fragrancenet was a knockoff, cheap phony. Definitely NOT authentic. I had a little bit left in an old bottle and compared the old with the new bottle i Had rec'd. Pretty close in consistancy, but the Aveda frangrance was non existant and it does not condition my hair like the real stuff does. Be careful who you order from!"
3,"Smells nice, but otherwise is just okay",I've tried various conditioners and this is just okay due to the fact that it tends to make my hair flat. I've used other conditioners that add body and thickness to hair so this is why just 3 stars.
2,uneven at best,Not very good. I bought after hearing one of the cuts on Deep Tracks and being a Marriott fan from Small Faces Ogden Nutgone Flakes and Itchycoo Park and humble pie times.Don't bother with this one.
4,Best I found yet,"These were purchased for my Bosch orbital sander. They work great, especially if one remembers to start and stop the sander when it is on the wood. Otherwise it could come flying off after some use; but when used diligently as directed, works great. So much better than anything I found at the Big Box stores, who never really have a wide selection of anything decent."
3,not bad for the money,For the money they don't work to bad.You can't use them for very long and they seem to load up quite quickly.
5,Great value!,"I have used hundreds and hundreds of velcro sanding discs, first time with this brand. They hold up well! Dont pack up with dust quickly, stay sharp for a good amount of time. The amount of discs you get is a great deal over buying them at the big box home stores! I will order these for my woodshop again for sure."
2,Needed for school,"Only got this for class. It is hour average textbook. It explains things okay, but at the end of the day, it is just another textbook."
2,Where are the last four chapters?,This solutions book only goes through chapter 8 and the actual text has 12 chapters. I found that the answers were explained fairly well but I was very disappointed that it was missing several chapters and was probably not worth the money.
4,Heartfelt story with universal appeal,"Yoshiko Uchida writes of her experiences growing up during World War II living in California. Many of her works deal with the evacuation of Japanese Americans to internment camps away from the coastal areas. Although ""The Bracelet"" deals with the internment experience, the story has universal appeal because the theme is friendship. The young girl in the story is evacuated to a camp. Upon leaving, her best friend, who is Caucasian, gives her a bracelet. The young Japanese American girl loses this bracelet somewhere along her journey--it is not shown where. At the end of the story, the young girl realizes that you don't have to have material possessions to remember and maintain a friendship. True friendships transcend material belongings. The illustrations are especially nice and in full color throughout."
5,This is a wonderful and beautifully illustrated book.,"This is a wonderful story about friendship. A young Japanese girl is sent to an internment camp. Before she leaves an American friend of hers gives her a bracelet to remember her by. When the bracelet is lost, the little girl is heart broken. Later she realizes that one does not need material objects to symbolize a friendship."
2,Nice storyline for a young child,I was disappointed after receiving this. I expected much more in the storyline....I was expecting a grownup book...not a booklet w/pictures. It is a very thin booklet with pictures to help tell the story. It is suitable for a very young person for someone to read to them and have them look at the pictures as they are being read to.
3,Basic,"This book is best for those with very little golf knowledge or experience. It has some helpful thoughts for kids who have been playing for awhile but is targeted to newcomers to the game. It does give an interesting look inside a young Tiger Woods but a lot of the information seems outdated. An example is his idea of personal par for junior players. Many courses have junior tees which makes personal par from the adult tees irrelevant. The main points that seem helpful are to practice all shots (putting, full swing and less than full swing) at every practice."
3,"Island in the sun is great, but lacked true romance.","I loved watching Harry Belafonte and Dorothy Dandridge getting a chance to act in this film. [instead of being a deletable sequence] It has intrigue, suspence, scandal, mistrust, lies, murder and romance. The romance however is lacking. Simply because Hollywood didn't want to offend by showing interrical couples [D.D. & John Justin, H.B & Joan Fontaine kissing.] So at crucial points in the film it seems strained, fake and a little silly. But, Nevertheless you get to see a colorful splice of life portrayed by some of Hollywoods greatest legends."
3,Island In The Sun,"This is a movie about relationships - interracial, parental, romantic - set in the beauty of the Caribbean. The visuals in this film are just spectacular. Harry Belafonte and Dorothy Dandridge are sparingly used; Dandridge's character is never really explored. I enjoyed watching this film although all of the relationships were not clearly developed. The story moved along at a good pace and the ending left me quite satisfied. I found it amusing that with all of the passion that Dandridge had for her paramour, they weren't allowed to kiss. Glad to have this in my collection."
3,DOROTHY DANDRIDGE IS THE REASON TO WATCH!,"Interracial romance is just one of the topics covered in ""Island in the Sun"", a Darryl Zanuck production,directed by Robert Rossen(The Hustler).Politics and political crime are also covered,especially those areas that touch the Fleury family of James Mason,in a so-so performance.The REAL star of this film is the utterly fantastic Dorothy Dandridge,who sizzles EVERY moment she is on screen!The rest of the cast Stephen Boyd,Joan Collins, and Michael Rennie is just average.The ""other"" interracial romance between John Fontaine and Harry Belafonte is a bore.Included in the DVD is at he original theatrical trailer,a fine documentary from A&E concerning Dorothy,and a poor commentary,on the film, by John Stanley,who is listed as a film historian."
4,island in the sun,this is an all time classic where one can watch real acting. This film was very forward for it's era when mixed relationships were taboo. A truly wonderful look at the human struggle and its ensuing emotions.
2,Good coffee but bad quirks,"While we were pleased with the quality of the coffee produced, we are totally fed up with its leaking and dumping water. We live in a rural area and at least a couple of times a year the power goes out. This coffee pot has a 'vacation' setting that you use when on vacation. If you unplug appliances when you travel you'll return to a counter full of water and an empty coffee maker. Unfortunately, if the power goes out, the coffee maker decides that it has been unplugged and dumps its contents all over the counter.Also, after years of ones that turn themselves off after a couple of hours, it is annoying to spend this much for one and have that basic feature missing. One instance of brain rot could easily burn down your house if you forget to turn off the pot before leaving the house."
5,Worth every penny,"This is a great coffee maker. It lives up to all of its claims and more. It truly does make the coffee in three minutes or less and the coffee tastes wonderful. The fact that it sprays the ground coffee instead of drowning it makes for a smooth and rich cup of coffee. I really like the pour spout on the pot as they found a way that makes it dripless. So far it has worked consistently fine in all ways. The attention to every small detail truly shows in the results. You can pay more or pay less, but this coffee maker lives up to its reputation and is well worth the price."
5,GREAT COFFEEMAKER,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST COFFEMAKERS IN THIS PRICE RANGE THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE. THE COFFEE TASTES GREAT AND THERE ISN'T A MACHINE THAT CAN MAKE A POT OF COFFEE ANY FASTER THAN THE BUNN. YOU ALWAYS HAVE HOT WATER READY. GREAT CHOICE.
3,Good but Shallow,"If you've never thought of connecting movies to management, this might be a good start. But it lacks both depth and breadth. I kept thinking of all the other movies the author missed."
4,Works great!,Great tool for those with back pain. Helps relieve tightness and pain in my upper back and neck. But be careful...working muscles too hard at first caused me extreme soreness and nerve pain. Take it slow.
3,Body Back Buddy,"I preferred a brand that could be pulled apart and transported easily in a bag or suitcase. The product worked okay for my pain, but not as well as a similar product."
1,Only received part of the order.,"While the larger piece is good I never received the smaller one. I finally ordered it separately and paid for it again, but it was not the same as was in the picture."
1,Waste of money,The blue piece is too big to handle. Niether piece work as stated. I would not recommend this to anyone.
4,back buddy,Product works well and as advertised. Really gets the kinks out and the mini bbb is great on trips.
4,Looks silly... But wow a knot buster...,"Got this a little over a week ago. I was skeptical at first, but wow once you figure out the best way for you.. Wow! Have yet to figure out the best use for the little one but the larger massager is definitely beneficial. Definitely do try!"
5,Incredible Product,"I have suffered neck and back pain for years. I have had Chiropractic and massage visits. Eventually, I began ""self-adjusting"" and cracked my own neck and back even though I knew it was bad in the long run, it provided me with relief. One massage therapist in an chiropractor's office used the TheraCane on me. It worked well. When I went to buy a TheraCane, I stumbled on the Body back buddy. I decided to buy it, figuring that I could buy a TheraCane if it was of poor quality or design. I cannot say enough good things about it. It is well designed and built to last. Mine came in a box, not an envelope like another reviewer. Mine was also in new condition, without scratches and burrs like another reviewer. I believe that any previous problems have been remedied. This is a fantastic product."
5,Boyfriend loves it,"My sig. other actually ordered this through me and he is totally delighted with it. A friend had one and he tried it, then got his own. It really hits nerves and feels great."
4,Great Tool!,My doctor recommended it to help me realign my connective tissues. It works great and helps me to take the pain out of my shoulder and neck.
5,Trigger Point Relief- Excellent Results,"After receiving trigger point therapy I was a bit skeptical, but the Back Buddy cane is the best. I can treat myself almost as good as the therapist and most important, when I need it and where I need it. Best pain relief investment I have ever made. No drugs, no stress, no problem. Highly reccommended!"
5,Easy self-help pain management,Works great. Everyone that visits picks it up and starts playing with it. I explain how it works based on the Clair Davies book. The instructions that come with it are not complete. I used to think this stuff was bull. But have been using trigger point therapy for over a year with great success. I am an athlete with new aches and pains all the time. This saves your fingers and gets to places you cannot reach. I keep the smaller one in my briefcase and use at work and while traveling.
5,GREAT TOOL,"I used to work for a therapist office, and we had something similar that we used. I never thought that I could afford to have my own. This works well to release trigger points: just push ""into"" the tight muscle and hold firm until it releases."
4,A little pressure goes a long way,"Frequent neck and lower back pains are now much easier to deal with.Cane is heavy duty and will stand up to much use quite well.Enabled me to get directly to pain area - However I did not read the part about holding for a few seconds and overdid it, resulting in extreme pain the following day.I do need to purchase more info about pressure points and usage in the near future.This will be a frequently used item in my household!"
5,Very unique!,Should advertise more. At least get the product out there for patients that could maybe relieve some fibromyalgia symptoms. My wife shows some relief with its use.
4,"Not a big fan of the Mini BBB, but....","I Love the Body Back Buddy! I mainly use for my neck, back and palms but I can wait to try it on my legs and feet. It took a few days to get the hang of it but now I'm addicted! The mini bbb I use as a back scratcher- its too flimsy for anything else."
4,Wish I had two,I ordered this combo and only received the Back Buddy. The Mini was nowhere to be found. I contacted Amazon and they return half the cost. I was happy with that because the Back Buddy alone would have cost about $10 more. I save money.\I use it for trigger points in my back and shoulder. It works well.It is also a nice conversation starter when people come in my office wondering what this gadget is.I generally keep it in the trunk of my car so I have access to it at home too. Wish I had another.
3,Great except hard to store away,"I used to have one that didn't have so many knobs on it that I liked better but this one does the trick. The knobs are kind of pointed which sometimes I like and other times I don't. I don't really use all the little knobs on it, just the ones on the ends. I keep the small one in my office at work and that comes in handy."
5,Body back massager is definetly worth a try.,"I use this weekly if not daily. It takes a while to figure out how to use it effectively after that it's awesome. It definetly does not beat a professional massage session which can be expensive, but is probably the next best thing especially if used with massage oil and it can be used anytime. Once u find a knotted muscle and work it out, u'll fall in love with this. Highly recommend or at least try. The mini bbb is just ok, it is very limited compared to the regular bbb. I can do without the mini but not with the regular bbb."
3,A great a-side and an intriguing b-side.,"Taken from theAnd Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Outalbum, the single for ""You Can Have It All"" features two mixes of the title track with a cover of the Bonzo Dog Band's ""Ready-Mades"".The title track is a great pop piece, featuring a bouncing backing vocal, a chugging rhythm and a fantastic cello counter to Georgia Hubley's lead vocal. It's remix is something I could live without-- it adds extra layers of drumbeats and pulls Hubley's vocal straight out in front-- I'm happier with the original mix on this one. ""Ready-Mades"" is a fairly unusual performance, gentle vocals and swelling horns provide for an intriguing mix on the piece-- it's not indespensable, but it's awfully good.Still, there's not enough on here to make it worth tracking down by all but the biggest diehard of the band."
2,Not very impressive,Pluses: uses traditional characters; lists both pinyin (romanization) and hanzi (chinese characters) for some words. Minuses: teaches you an outdated style of speech; does not include hanzi for a lot of words; linguistic explanations have plenty of errors and are not very revealing; plenty of typos; very poorly printed -- did they use an old Xerox machine or something?; lots of propaganda.
4,Previous Customer Reviews seem Biased,"I have only listened through this CD once, and I must say that I found it quite enjoyable. I must also say that the review given by Amazon, is the most acurate amongst the reviews I've read here. Ghoerghiu clearly has a beautiful, well produced voice, and that is in evidence here. She does NOT have intonation problems in this recital, and while at times her vioce feels like it could be more florid and relaxed in places it is generally easily produced. If you enjoy her smokey hued voiced you will enjoy this album, although it is not the most artistically put together recital, in general I concur totally with the Amazon editorial review. I too believe that this CD forshadows directions Ghoerghiu could take herself."
4,Angela Gheorghiu is the top!,"I did not give this CD full credit, because although of course Angela's voice is the most beautiful in the world, the music on this CD is 90% the same as on other CD's."
3,Too little too slow,"While I agree that Angela has a gorgeous voice and sings quitebeautifully, she stretches some of the music out of shape. CastaDiva withou ""Sediziosi Voci"" is an aria of 5:00 - 5:30 in length. She takes a fule 7:25 to sing without the recitative. The same goes for ""Ah! non credea mirarti"". Gorgeously sung and phrased ultimately ruined by the excessive length. Some of the blame for this may be placed on Evelino Pido who indulges her. Also, she has already recorded Manon in French with her husband, why not sing the William Tell aria as ""Sombre Foret"".I can't wholly recommend this recording although she has the potential to develop into a true bel cantist."
2,"The book is a boring, complicated, and exageratedlove story.","The book is about a juicy love story between many people. Catherine's love to every member of the male gender is ridiculous. The characters' relations to each other are undefined. There are too many narrator shifts in the middle of the story. If you like romance (this one doesn't get to specific about the relationships), then this is the book for you. But if you like action and something that progresses fast, you probably won't like the book."
3,disappointing,"I was expecting more from this work based on Hogg's excellent WW2 publications, and was sorely disappointed.Technical data is presented for only a handful of weapons - in some cases uncommon ones while common ones get only a prose description in the text, and many weapons are mentioned only in passing. The whole Serb and Belgian artillery parks have no technical data presented at all.It covers the common weapons well enough, but there's no shortage of information on them."
3,It's okay but not high quality,"This type of bandage is of average quality. The fabric does not have the stretch that better quality brand name bandages of this type have. For the price the quality is appropriate but if you want a bandage that will last a long time, I would buy a high quality item."
3,ok,I was a little dissapointed because I thought I was paying for the four bandages in the picture. One was not enough but it arrived fast.
3,"Good, but....","I'd heard from others how good this series is; the story of women who worked with underground, resistance, etc. during WWII. But I wish I'd known about the nudity before I bought this collection. Be forewarned..."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"This series is the worst acting I have ever seen in a BBC series. The music between acts sounds like superman, the foreign accents of the European actors were pathetic! It was as though the entire series had a prompter in front of the actors at all times. Don't waste your time or money watching this series. I actually would give ita "" MINUS-ZERO"" GRADE... but that option was not available!"
4,"Reasonably bright, simple to use","I use this every day when I take the dogs outside in the dark, and it works reliably. It's fairly compact and can be put in your pocket. I was using a different LED flashlight before, one that you shake, and it was not bright enough. The Wind 'N Go flashlight is much brighter than the old LED flashlight, not quite as bright as a Maglite flashlight, but not having to replace batteries in the Wind 'N Go is a nice trade-off.The crank is easy to turn. It is a little noisy when being cranked.It has one button operation, which is simple but a little quirky. Each time it is turned on, it either lights one LED for power saving, or it lights three LEDs for more brightness. It alternates between the two modes, so if it turns on in the wrong mode, you have to turn it off and on again. If you always want to use it in one mode, you have to turn it on and off and on each time you use it."
5,fantastic flashlight,I've had this crank flashlight for years. Very durable product. I carry it every where I go. I have never been disappointed with the performance and the ease of use.
2,Wind N Go Flashlight,"I bought this little flashlight around two years ago to have for emergencies. I thought the windup feature was great because it seems like whenever there is an emergency, the batteries in my flashlight are dead. The last time I needed this flashlight, I found out that winding it no longer worked. The battery didn't retain the charge. Worthless. I should have kept a supply of regular batteries. They last longer!"
1,Not a good emergency flashlight.,"I kept this in my emergency bag for several years, took it out today and it's not functional. Sure, it was neglected, but it's supposed to be useful in emergencies. It's not."
4,Buena calidad a bajo precio,"Wind'N go flashlight es un excelente producto para solucionar problemas de iluminación en cualquier parte. Tiene 2 modos de operación: en uno de ellos enciende solo un led y en el otro encienden los 3 leds. Tiene un haz de luz blanca muy últil para trabajos caseros aun cuando olvidaron incluir una argolla para facilitar colgar la linterna.La carga por 1 minuto le ofrece una operación razonable de unos 30 min, luego, es un buen producto muy útil en el carro y en trabajos caseros."
3,Good gift for those people you don't know what to buy for,"I need a small gift for people, and thought how about an emergency flashlight for the car. It's something people will use . Works for me! Also good for campers, of which I have 2 nephews who camp ."
4,Wind N Go Flashlight,"The flashlight performs exactly as I had hoped. Very good light, easy to crank and decent lasting charge from 1 minute of cranking.You may sacrifice a little bit of brightness but you will save HUGE on batteries. Anything that works without batteries is a great thing and this definatley works!"
1,Junk Junk Junk Junk Junk Junk Junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For everyone out there if they bring this back DO NOT buy it! I bought 2 dozen of these for my customers as Christmas gifts and they worked fine for about 6 months. After that they started to hold less and less of a charge until after about a year they would no longer work. The battery or capacitor inside is soldered into place so it is basically not replacable. I tried to contact the customer service dept. at ATHENA Brands Inc. and was redirected to someplace else. They gave me a bunch of BS on how to recharge the battery which did not work. When I contacted them back they said too bad out of warranty. I had 4 of them left over that were still packaged and opened all of them. Right out of the pack none of these worked either. Great idea, bad, bad design."
5,DESCRIBING A NACHTMARE,The author of this book actually lived thru five years of the Depression as a street person -- reading the book takes the reader into a nightmare. The seller's description of the item was correct: Would buy from this seller again.
1,Still Waiting,"I would have liked to receive this item as I had ordered it. However, the shipper decided to ship me a different pattern."
5,a great romp through the wild west,"What a book! Geology, celestial navigation, astronomy, science fiction--all wrapped up in a large cast of real figures from the history of the west. This book is great fun. Anyone who is interested in the west and likes also to ponder the ""what if's"" and ""could be's"" of life will find this novel to be a great pleasure as well as a thought provoking read."
5,Wendy and Mary music - beautiful,"If you haven't ever listened to Wendy and Mary's music, you are missing out. Beautiful voices and peaceful lyrics, so glad I have their music back again in finding their cassetes for purchase online."
3,top and bottom different colors.,"I ordered a set and recieved it in time for a winter trip. However, it was two different colors (ecru and white) so I think that they were thrown together in error. Unfortunately,we needed to use it shortly after receiving it. It was warm and very easy to pack."
5,Wendy and Mary,This is a great CD for any Wendy and Mary fans. I know they're passe now but this CD has wonderfully emotion-filled music.
4,A true teacher's helper,"This is a very well organized book with many activities. Each phonics section has a parent letter, activities, worksheets, a poem and more. It truly is a great big book, also. It has added many ideas to my teaching repertoire and is easy to use and fit into plans. I'm thrilled that I bought it!"
3,Good product but nothing special compared to others.,"I bought the assortment pack as well as 120 and 220 grits in preparation for refinishing my kithen cabinets. I have used the 80 and 100 grit from the assortment pack and find them quite acceptable. However, I don't see much difference between this brand and the Norton abrasives brand I can buy at Home Depot. Packs of 50 are almost $10 in the store, Mirka are around $8 per 50 sold in 100 packs. Once you add shipping, unless you buy a large quantity, you're not saving anything. I disagree with one of the other reviewers that said Norton brand discs are thinner and ware out faster. I couldn't notice any appreciable difference between Nortons and Mirka's disc thickness. The abrasive is aluminum oxide for both."
5,"Sweet, Soul-Stirring Susan at Her Finest!","I love Susan's innocent freshness and her voice that is so pure and gentle. Every song on this album is gorgeous and combines her gentle spirit with lovely vocals and back-up music. She's a gem in the Christian music industry, and I only regret that she has not had a new album in far too long! Come back to us, Susan, we miss your voice out here in Amazing Grace Land!"
1,"Not Surprising, just sad!","One wonders if Ms. Reynolds was enjoying an afternoon on the grass herself when she came upon her theory. Or was it simply an effort to get some publicity for a book that in no way measures up to the competition. Perhaps there was consideration of calling it ""Dante's Trip: What a Comedy"" to broaden readership.In any case, with all the great works about the Divine Comedy, including Joseph Gallagher's ""Modern Reader's Guide"" and Eric Auerbach's ""Dante, Poet of the Secular World,"" and biographies such as Paget Toynbee's ""Dante Aligieri: His Life and Works,"" I recommend that you avoid Ms. Reynolds attempt at originality.I understand that Academics live under the rule ""Publish or Perish"" but one encounters sufficient sensationalism in our modern inferno, must we project our own shallowness into the past?It is sad that many of us are unable to imagine a time when gifted people could experience a spiritual journey and exercise their imagination without chemical support."
5,Fantastic Sandpaper,"I now use this sand paper exclusively, when it gets too worn out for the RO sander, it gets tossed around the shop for years, It just lasts forever, albeit at the next hightest grit."
1,Worthless,"I now use exclusively 3M sandpaper after receiving a sample at a trade show, you have to use three Mirka sandpaper disc for every one 3M sandpaper disc. I used to think sandpaper was sandpaper didn't make a bit of difference who manufactured it, I was wrong."
5,A great preliminary step for a great finish,"In the surface finishing process, I use the 23-615-220 as a preliminary smooth finishing step that removes the majority of surface blemishes. I complete the process using the Mirka 320 grit and perhaps some 00 or 000 steel wool.This ""step process"" provides for a great base for coatings such as oil or urethane."
2,meh performance,"I tried out the 80 grit pad for a couple of minutes and the disk was almost used up in this time spent on my DA. The dust collection holes are placed properly and allow most of the dust to be collected in my filter bag. They work almost as well as my cheap ones from Harbor Freight, but that isn't saying really. I would not buy these again as they have such a short lifespan and the fact that I have picked up 100 sanding pads from HF recently for just $4 plus tax. I will update as I use more sanding disks over time."
4,Easy grip glass,"I like the indentations on the side which makes this glass easly to grip. We did receive one that was broken, since the packaging could have been better - but we did not attempt to return.One other issues is that we put them in the dishwasher and they have an indentation on the bottom of the glass which collects water and tends to water spot.I would buy them again though."
1,NOT Made in the USA,"I'm sure these glasses are perfectly fine. But this page boasts that the glasses are ""Made in USA"". They are not, they come with a sticker that clearly states they were made in Mexico."
3,Music good Singing Horrible,"To have music this good and singing this bad together is a real crying shame. During the instrumental parts, you realize how talented this band will become. But the singing is so bad when it is there that you literally want to take a hammer to the CD. This is a one time listen and then put this CD in a deep dark drawer never to be seen again."
1,Boring......(yawn),"I love Anathema...... but not this album. There are maybe 2 stand-out tracks that are mediocre at best. the rest of ""the silent enigma"" is well.... very bad. Death Growls are laughable played against any kind of metal.... but Anathema tops death/vox comedy here. While the mood on this album is probably the darkest of all Anathema albums..... it is still a horrible release. There are fine reasons why albums like ""the silent enigma"" were not released in the United States until years after its' european release and why it received absolutely no press coverage. I'm happy that they buried the hatchet on the ""doom/death"" sound and opted for a more refined goth/prog rock sound with ""eternity"", ""alternative 4"", and ""judgement"". If you want an Anathema album.... buy anything released after ""the silent enigma""...... total garbage"
5,"This is a fabulous book, everyone should read it!","I absolutley love this book. Veronica and Joe make a great couple and team. I love the story line: it is fun, exciting and keeps you held to the end, I wish Suzanne Brockman would write a sequel to Joe and Veronica's story!"
1,A disappointed Brockmann fan....,"The reviews of this book here at Amazon had me waiting at the mailbox for this one to arrive....only to be disappointed with it's lack of content. Not only was the story line a little far fetched (okay, it IS romance/fantasy), but the main character, Joe, was as wishy washy as Joe-blow-next-door-neighbor. Forget about not being able to put it down.....I went the other end of the spectrum and couldn't pick it up! Sorry, Suzanne!!"
5,Great kick off to the the TDD series!,"I finally found a copy of Prince Joe and it didn't disappoint. A European Crown Prince is targeted by terrorists and as he is the spitting image of Lt. Joe ""Cat"" Catalonotto, Joe is enlisted to pose as the Crown Prince, and hopefully become the target so that the would-be assassins can be caught.Veronica St. John is Prince Tedric's media assistant, and it's her job to transform the rough, New Jersey-accented Joe into Prince material. Although Veronica is strongly attracted to Joe, and viceversa, each believes that their worlds are just too different for a relationship to ever work.As time goes by and the two are thrown together, Joe and Veronica realize that the danger of their mission might mean that they don't have a future together, even if they wished to.This is a great book, the characters are well drawn and we meet several of the men who have their own stories told in the SEALs' later books. Joe Cat and Veronica are characters to cheer for."
3,Love those Navy Seals,"I very much enjoyed the storyline to this book. Veronica St. John is charged with teaching a Navy Seal (Joe) to impersonated a prince. In that story there is danger and excitement.The romance was the element I did not enjoy. Although they had flying sparks, the characters kept misunderstanding each other and pulling their hearts back to keep from being burned. I find that aggravating, especially when the hero is such an Alpha male! They should have had a good fight and let the truth come out way sooner.Happy reading!"
5,Great Book,The book was great. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Joe was a great hero as well as Veronica a herione. It has comic relief and romance. I totally recommend this book to any one!! Nice job Suzanne Brockmann.
2,Not as interesting.,I think of Caroline Myss' other two books as adding to my information and spiritual knowledge. This boook however does not have the same effect. It's main theme is to 'pay it forward'.
3,great for the novice spiritual seeker.......,"if you are an avid fan of spiritual text, this will disappoint. however, it is a nice clear reminder of the ways in which we can choose to live, to create a more intimate life. i enjoyed the book as light reading."
3,Caroline Myss is amazing,I love most of Caroline Myss's writing and some of it has been life changing for me. Particularly 'Why People don't heal' and 'Sacred Contracts'. This book was great but I have reservations because the christian element was a little too much for me. A good read though.
3,Great but check your purchase.,I purchased this audio book from Amazon and have nothing bad to say about the book but found out shortly that track five of disc one is missing. If you want the whole book make sure you see this missing track when downloading. Hope to see the whole book soon.
3,Don't know about advanced,"I suppose it depends on your point of view. I picked PHP a couple of months ago (built on top of long experience in other languages) - and I wanted something with a bit of bite in it, and while there were somethings I found interesting, I don't know whether advanced is a really applicable.If you're moving from, say, HTML development into PHP, I would actually recommend this. It covers a nice range of topics - certainly pointing you in the right direction for PHP development.If you want a good solid reference for the best way to do particular 'advanced' applications - maybe not.My copy was printed with the cover on the wrong side - so having to read it backwards made it tricky. But I'm left-handed, so I'm used to it."
3,Semolina Flour = Sooji,"I was having trouble finding semolina flour until I ventured into my local indian grocery and found a bag of Sooji. That's the Indian translation for semolina flour, and it only cost me $1.99 for 2 pounds (no shipping charge and no tax). Suggest you try it and compare to this product; you might save some serious $$$. I will be trying it in my Italian bread recipes."
4,"""Compare and contrast""","Uneven but overall, a nice collection of doowop and novelty numbers. Two versions of Book of Love plus an attempted follow up about Reading the Book of Love make this worth picking up. An extra bonus is 1958's ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" which cries out for comparison with the ""Rip Van Winkle,"" that other Washington Irving tribute by the Devotions of the early 60s. A good test case for how difficult deciding matters of copyright in pop music can become."
2,The best of the Monotones is certainly not their best.,"Who wrote the book of love is wonderfully performed by the Monotones, but unfortunately this album has left me cold as it could have included more well known songs. Sorry guys."
5,Ahh Keith,"In the 70's prior to his untimely death, Keith green was a musical treasure in the church for the college agebelievers.....funny, I do not remember getting older, but his music is as current today, more so, then it wad then.Worth having in any library."
5,Great survey of 150 years of history!,"Ferguson does a wonderful job making Canadian history, traditionally perceieved as a dull topic, into an enthralling tale of a budding nation, people, and the strange contradiction that is inherent to all things Canadian. The language is simple, yet the ideas are very critical. The humoUr is terrific, yet Ferguson pulls no punches in condemning some of Canada's more shameful history. An excellent primer for anybody interested in Canadian history."
3,it was broader line ok for me,THOUGHTS:It was broader line ok for me not strong enough but thats just my opinion maybe someone else will really love it when they read it
5,Love IT,"I've been meaning to rate this album for quite sometime so, here I am. It's a masterpiece. All of the tracks are great. I have just about all of Grover's albums and for those of you looking to add him to your collection, this would be a great addition. The man and his music have so captivated my own life that I'm at a loss for words as I'm typing this review. He was simply the best. Yes, there are many, many Sax players out there that are great but it's something about Grover that made you feel like he was a close personal friend. The man and his music are sorely missed."
5,A true forefather of the Smooth Jazz and Quiet Storm genres.,"This 1982 release's title track is a showcase for both Grover's inspired yet soulful and uplifting sax playing and Patti La Belle's soulful vocals. While they were left as album tracks ""Mixty Motions"" and ""Things Are Getting Better"" are gorgeous gems which merit buying this CD. Enjoy!"
3,Engaging but repetitive,"As a highly unschooled Cunningham fan -- this is the first dance book I've ever read -- I found Copeland's book engaging in its scope, contextualizing Cunningham's choreography in relation to the leading cultural and aesthetic movements of the last half century. Copeland has essentially one thesis, stated fairly cleanly in the introduction. I would highly recommend the introduction. Unfortunately the rest of the book can be tedious and dogmatic as Copeland attempts to bolster his arguments through a strategy of repetition and exhaustion. Every movement and idea of the late 20th century seems to be a nail for Copeland's rhetorical hammer, and while I found the tie-ins and tidbits of history interesting enough to finish the book, I found the tone and structure of the book to be artificially argumentative and quite lacking in the openness and nuance that Copland praises Cunningham for."
2,See ya later,I bought three different grits and have used two of them. I feel the abrasive on the disk wears off to soon. They're cheap enough but you'll use twice as many. I expected more from a product made in Finland. The ones from Home Depot (Norton brand I think )last longer.
4,Makita sanding disks,Excellent disk for general sanding...I have purchased several grits for furniture finishing and have found it to be worth the money.
3,This book is worth reading,"C.I. Scofield was a fine Christian man and pastor. He is a prime example of the difference Jesus Christ can make in one life. However, his writings, particular the notes in his Scofield Reference Bible, have exerted an influence far beyond Scofield's actual scholastic ability. Many Christians today hold the teachings of Scofield to be on part with the Scripture itself. However, the last time I checked, Scofield did not write any of the 66 books of the Bible.This book does an adequate job of revealing that Scofield's theology is not without question. While some people equal questioning Scofield with questioning the Apostle Paul, this book does a good job of showing that Scofield's interpretation of Scripture is not the only one with merit. The book is not perfect, but it provides good food for thought. That is, assuming the reader does not equate second guessing Scofield with heresy."
2,Freddie Scott Sings,"With all due respect to the late Mr. Scott, the ""Collectables Record Corp."" did a, somewhat, fair job of re-recording his signature songs of ""Hey Girl & I Got A Women""! His Hey Girl track lacks the dynamic sound quality that I remember the first time I heard it on my parent's AM radio back in 1963! In my opinion, all the songs need to be ""digitally remastered"" to bring out the great voice of ""Freddie Scott""!"
3,freddie scott,I used to own this cd in lp format. the sound qualityis not great here as it seems like it was'nt remasteredproperly. But still I am greatful to have this lpon cd.
5,Best Sandpaper for the Money,"I've been using Norton Brand for years just because it is readily available locally. When it came time to stock up, Mirka was recommended, so I decided to give it a try, especially since a 50-pack costs $17, vs. $9 on a 10-pack of equivalent Norton Sandpaper.After using the Mirka for a few weeks, there is no comparison. The Mirka last longer and the 320 grit leaves a smoother finish than any other 320 grit paper I've used. As I use up my Norton paper, I will be replacing it exclusively with Mirka H&L; disks."
5,sanding discs,Love these sanding discs. so easy to install and they last quite a long time. Have mostly used the finishing ones.
4,Great value,"These sanding discs work great and have a better life than the home-improvement chain alternatives. Being a fraction of the price makes them a very good value. If you are purchasing for the first time, make sure to figure out whether your sander takes 5-hole or 8-hole sanding discs."
5,Orbital sandpaper,I haden't seen this fine grip paper before so I wanted to try some. For me it has really added some fine finish sanding capability that I didn't have before. Good value and long lasting paper.
3,Wonderful singer....but the music leaves much to be desired.,"I saw Rocio in concert a week ago and fell in love with her music [I have heard it for years...and had never realized how much I like her music]. I ran to the store to buy a ""greatest hits"" collection and bought this one. Yet when I started listening to it I realized the music was not the original [which adds much to the lyrics] but is performed by an orchestra. No problem with that...except the CD does not say that anywhere on the outside. I felt cheated...I ran back and bought a collection of the ""original"" songs."
5,P.I. Takes Charge,"Bad dude (Hooks) on the trail of the usual thugs and a childhood friend gone bad(Winfield). Lots of action especially in the pool hall, when Chalky washes Mr Big away in the shoot-out."
3,Very good picture. Never looked better,"Watching this on a blue ray play upgraded the picture to near 1080p 24. No distortion. Very clear. Good contrast and rich color.Not a great movie but better than a lot of those made about black men from 1971 to 1980. Definitely a period piece. Some of the language and culture is dated, in a bad way, but that was the some of the culture of urban America in the early 1970's"
2,"Without Marvin, not worth it...","I've been waiting for this title to become available on dvd because it's been impossible to find on VHS. SAVE YOUR MONEY. They seem to have dumped the original soundtrack. It's not there. The movie opens with Marvin Gaye's wonderful voice drowned out by someone else singing over him. That was it for me. What made the film exceptional for the time period was Marvin Gaye's masterful soundtrack. I couldn't believe what had been done. Truly disappointing. If you don't mind this oversight, you'll love this dvd. If you're looking for the original soundtrack to this film, save your money."
5,"Don't mess with ""T""",Great movie! A must for black exploitation buffs! Awesome score by the legendary Marvin Gaye. I'm glad it's finally in print.
3,the subtitled is WAY BETTER!,"First off, you want the subtitled, because it's NOT edited. Now if your a under the age of 13 then YES get THIS VERSION, casuse subtitled has nudity, (MORE then just a kiss between Mel and Gene) and they couse. a lot (f word, both b's, d, h.. etc) I'm not saying ALL of that is in the subtitled version of this, but in others they'll through it in there every so offen! My mom like freaked on me (I'm a 14 year old girl) cause Gene was coursing off! lol, all I could do was laugh casue it was a funny part actully! OH! and if you haven't seen the WHOLE series (Meening epi 1- the end! You've gotta or you'll miss SOO much of the romantic parts, and thrillign acttion stuff! hehe (I love this show! ^-^)"
5,Russ Taff,I own all his music and this cd is awesome. He has such a wonderful voice and talent. I highly recommend this cd to add to your collection.
5,Best sanding disc,"Do a lot of sanding with a makita sander,been in the business25+ years.The Mirka brand is one of the best .There are many brands average,a few very poor."
5,Mirka's sanding discs,Great product and one I've been using for years. I like to buy them in bulk so that they are always there when I need them.
5,Mirka 80 Grit,"This is a top brand of sanding disc, one which I had never tried until now. I received these discs in only two days, and was very pleased at the fine quality. Comparing them to other brands I would say they are at least as durable, and possibly the best I have ever used."
3,mediocre,"I am disappointed with the Mirka discs I bought in 80, 150, and 220 grits. The reason is that they don't last very long. They simply lose their effectiveness in what seems like a fairly short time. When first used the discs sand nicely, and seem to cut rapidly without making swirl marks. Before long they are sanding very slowly, and if I use them too long they will make swirl marks. I used them on red cedar, a very soft wood, so I expected them to last at least twice as long.I do think the grit is pretty uniform in size, as I got no swirls during the sharp cutting phase.I actually considered sending them back, but do not have time to find and buy better ones. I think I was spoiled by the discs I used at work which were labelled ""Regis""."
5,Great 80 grit paper,Much like the 60 grit paper this has outstanding cutting and lasting capabilities. Would recommend it to anyone.
2,Don't cut very long,"I made a mistake and bought boxes of fifty of most grits because the vendor at a show had limited selection. They do not cut very long. As another review said, they cut great for a short while, then quit, then swirl mark. The vendor said, they are designed for that, use it and change it. Great for Mirka, if you keep buying their product.I find it is a lot of time wasted stopping several times per piece to change the paper. And you can have alternating areas of well sanded and poorly sanded wood. This can show up when its too late (finishing). Will buy a better brand next time. There are several other brands that are much better for little to no extra cost."
1,Not worth the price.,"You get what you pay for. I used these pads primarily on red oak. I know from experience the cutting diminishes quickly with hard woods, but I never expected this. The 80 grit pads wore down literally within 30 seconds of sanding. The 220 grit lasted somewhat longer. I'll go back to my old brand."
5,"holds up great, little clogging",the 80 grit lasts a long time with no scratching of my pine flooring. not sure if results would have been the same with hardwood flooring. very happy
5,Watch the dust fly,"Fast delivery, great sanding discs, great price. Best quality I can find. I get my work done faster."
5,"Christian music, Wendy and Mary","Wendy & Mary have been classic since their music first appeared. Their music is a breath of fresh air that it timeless with it fresh harmonies, acoustic guitars, and beautiful message. They are a must for any collection of Christian, folk, or acoustic music."
5,Legendary Voices: Rise Stevens,"Very good, considering the limited state of technology from the period. Very enjoyable recording."
1,Don't even think about it,"I just got this CD and I have to say it is the worst thing I have ever heard. It starts with a horrible version of Dougie MacLean's Caledonia and then goes downhill from there. Every song is over-done, over-produced, and over not soon enough. It's like they're all trying to be a 1980's supergroup or heavy metal wannabe. I can't say for sure, but it sounds to me like many of the bagpipes are synthesized, not the real thing. The sound levels are uneven with very poor quality. I'd rate this a zero if it went that low. I would consider giving this away, but I wouldn't inflict this on anyone. There's a reason audio samples are not available for this."
5,"A powerful album, indeed!","As I listen to this album over and over again, each track grows on me and adds to my pride in being of Scottish heritage. ""Caledonia,"" ""Hector the Hero,"" ""Slangeva"" (""Cheers"" in Gaelic), ""Always Argyll"" (even though I am a MacDonald of Glencoe descendant), ""Highland Cathedral,"" ""The Flower of Scotland,"" ""Will Ye No Come Back Again"" and ""When the Pipers Play"" are particular favorites but there is not a weak track in the album""s 17 selections. I am ordering additional copies as gifts for relatives. If you are a Scot, or simply love inspiring music, you will, too!"
5,One of the Most Useful Tools in Cult Apologetics,"This is one of the most functional resources for cult apologetics that I have ever seen. It is an ordinary King James Bible, but with every verse that is twisted by various cults, there is a footnoted Christian response, and a relevant cross reference or two. The book appears to have gone out of print, but is well worth tracking down."
5,my savior.,"i had a chemistry teacher who went over the entire acids&bases unit in a week, and im not a fan of our textbook. My whole review was based on this book, and i got a 800 on the exam. This book does a very thorough job of covering everything(maybe a little bit more) you need to know, and the practice exams are a teeny bit harder than the real test which means u will be very well prepared. I recommend going over this book fully(buy it, mark in it, et cetera), then borrow the princeton review book from the library or something to do the practice tests and skim over the contents because it's a bit more organized. don't bother with the kaplan book. it sucks."
1,ITEM NOT RECEIVED,I have not yet received this item. I am trully disappointed and would appreciate it if someone could contact me and let me know what happened.Francesca Ronci
5,The archetype for any publication about baseball history.,"Aside from the most comprehensive view of early baseball, Harold Seymour provides incredible insight as he takes the reader through every vital detail about the game's heritage. For a book written 40 years ago, it shows the author's masterful foresight of what baseball would, and did, become. Particularly compelling is how he shreds the Abner Doubleday myth before doing so was popular. His compilation and timeless analyses of baseball's sometimes painful adolescence gives the reader a solid baseline for understanding the difficulties that the sport is enduring today. It's fascinating proof that those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it. Anybody interested in baseball history will want to run right out and get his second volume, ""The Golden Age"" as soon as they finish this one"
2,You Won't Smell The Mustard With This One,"A mustard stain might not show on this hardcover book, but I doubt if Dr. Seymour's trips to the ballyard allow for hot dogs anyway. Maybe baseball really should be kept away from academics, who have a tendency to suck the life out of the game. The Notre Dame history professor who wrote the ""most scholarly"" life of Babe Ruth at least knew how to turn a phrase, if not ""two."" If Dr. Seymour is a fan he keeps it carefully under wraps.The best thing about this book is Seymour's careful ""deconstruction"" of some of baseball's cherished myths, chiefly Abner Doubleday's ""invention"" of it. The worst is that Seymour is altogether too enamored of the institutional side of the game. In the dialectic of style and structure he is so enmeshed in the structural aspects, the business aspects, even the legal aspects of the game, that the knothole gang is supplanted by the paneled boardroom. I wanted baseball lore but instead I got corporate logic. Not a satisfying read."
2,"Be forewarned - Not new, and a man's work","My wife bought this book many years ago for me, and I enjoyed it. I saw there was a new edition out, so I bought it, but it's not updated or revised, it just has the author's ex-wife's name appended to it now."
2,Patriots,A light read compared to some of his other books. Enjoyable but fairly forgettable. Drake usually has a sharper edge to his books. Patriots was more of a fluff piece. It's hard to believe this is the same man that gave us Hammers Slammers.
4,Hysterical Fun,"Forget Sex and the City and dive into Queer Chronicles, or as I see it: ""Sex and the Southern Guy"". Frank Blocker's alter ego, Kenneth, does it all and journalizes in prose that is both hyper-witty, incredibly detailed, eccentric, ironic, but most of all, just plain FUN. Atlanta's wild and gay 90s comes to vivid life; I especially enjoyed references to cruising at the ""Homo Depot"", the many and varied sideways glances towards ""the EX"", and a vivid recounting of turbulent events at the Atlanta Olympics. Plenty of political slant here -- Blocker/Kenneth has an opinion about EVERYTHING and is not shy about sharing! Bravo, Kenneth."
5,Slade keeps it comin',"Yet another harrowing, blood curdling tale in Slade's saga. We watch familiar characters battle even more evil humans (although - you would like to think they aren't with what they do..) Get ready for a bumpy night if you read this after dark!"
5,Special X #3 is a terrifying treat.,"Cutthroat is the third in Michal Slade's Special X series and, like a battlefield general or a grandmaster chess player, he has moved all his pieces into position to strike at the readers psyche' and leave them gasping in awe at the end.Special X, the external arm of the RCMP, takes on a globe hopping psycho and may be biting off more than they can chew.

Michael Slade's Cutthroat fires on all cylinders and will keep you reading late into the night."
1,SAUNDERS DICTIONARY,THIS BOOK WAS TOO OLD TO BE ON THE MARKET AND SELLER SHOULD HAVE SAID THE DATE OF THE PUBLICATION
4,Good quality.,This set is of excellent quality and they work great. The only thing I didn't like about the set is that they came mounted to a rail instead of in a case. The sockets would often fall off of the rail.
5,Wonderful for those family photos!,I got 3 of these to help organize my children's pictures into separate albums and they are great! Your memo notes just slide in a pocket between the 2 photos on each page so you can rearrange them any way you wish. Since these are the pocket pages there is no sticky glue for your pictures to stick to and get ruined by.I highly recommend this photo album! I'm going to get more for Christmas gifts!
5,Not Since Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune,Not Since Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune hit off-Broadway and ultimately the big screen has a character like Anna emerged who finds love among the pots and pans and juicy dishes of an eatery. Only this Frankie has more class to jettison as she searches for the meaning of life. Jane Ward has a touch of New England in her writing and her recipes and totally excites with this entertaining debut novel. I can't wait for her next one.
1,Old honey?,"I ordered this honey so that I could make some of the recipes in a Sardinian cookbook....unfortunately the honey arrived seriously crystalized. I'll see if I can melt it to reliquify, but my cookbook (and several others) states that Sardinian Bitter Honey is one of the honeys SLOWEST to crystalize....so, I'm thinking sales are slow and quality assurance poor. On the plus side, it did arrive in a timely manner. Personally, I won't buy again from this company."
5,Hook and loop sanding discs,I have had great luck with these and they seem to last quite awhile. We sanded the whold inside or our home with these and we have a log house.
3,Good Sanding Disks at a Good Price,I'm sanding my cedar deck boards in order to apply a new finish. These sanding disks cut quickly and leave a nice surface behind. The grit does not clog and lasts a long time. The only problem with these disks is the cloth backing for the hook and loop wears fast. It's frustrating that the backing will fail when the grit still has a lot of life remaining. These are about half the cost of 3M disks that I have used and perform well but have about half the life span as the 3M disks. So I guess you get what you pay for. If the backing performed better I'd give them at least 4 stars.
4,My choice,I have used this brand for lasting grit and cost per pack for over 5 years. Used to use the ones that had glue to stick on the pad with and those one could't remove and slap on other grits and return back to reuse it. Nice to have hook and loop that in dusty conditions will stick to the sander.
2,Cheap and inferior,"I have used similar Norton disks before and decided to try these because it looked like a good deal. However, while these Mirka are slightly cheaper than Norton, they are no-where near the quality --- Norton last 5 times longer than Mirka."
4,quality stuff,"This is my third box of this stuff, and I don't see any reason to buy anything else. I have used a few brands of discs. most are OK. this is as good as any, and better then most. paper is nice and thick and holds up well. the stuff stays sharp. There are better brands, but they tend to be about 75 cents a sheet. This stuff also beats the pants off the crud you get at HD too"
4,Good Headset But Needs Better Set Up Instructions,"I have had my headset for about 1 month and really like it--once I finally got it set up! The CD Rom they send as ""instructions"" for set up are extremely vague and need to be more explicit. I still don't know what the ""smart button"" does and/or what features it activates! I had never used a wireless headset before, so perhaps I needed a bit more handholding, but I shouldn't have had to struggle as much as I did with the set up. While I'm certainly not an IT whiz, I am fairly salient in electornics set up and was very put off by the set up process and the lack of explanation of features and how the headset actually operates. Otherwise, now that I'm over that hump (although I'd still like to know about the ""Smart Button"" although maybe it's only for ""smart"" people!), the headset is good, with good sound quality and is comfortable to weat."
4,Great for wireless dictation and soft phone applications,I use DragonNaturallySpeaking 9.5 preferred. This was the bluetooth microphone recommended by Nuance. It worked beyond my expectations. I am no longer limited by the wired headset that came with the program. I would recommend it for anyone using version 9 or higher. Well worth the money. I also use it for my skype application. No one has complained about not being able to hear me and I find the volume is fine.
5,Still the best,"A quick comment. I've had the cs50 for some years now and consider it still the best headset I've had, and I've several different and high quality brands. The CS50 is the best by far for Dragon Naturally Speaking. I also use it to communicate with Homeseer (smart home setup). The range is phenomenal. The accuracy is as good as it gets. I'm not using it much for phone, except when travelling, because my cordless phone is already set up for VOIP.Very comfortable to wear - I use the headset not the ear loop things.Just plugged it into my new laptop and it worked, so Vista already has the necessary drivers - no need for software downloads. My laptop has a sleep and charge function so no need to worry about the headset not charging when the laptop is in sleep mode.The CS50 was well worth the money spent and has paid for itself several times over. I don't know if there are newer models out, but don't need them in any case."
3,So far so good,So far so good. I can hear my clients clearly on other end and so far have no complaints on my callers hearing me ok. This is great... I am able to work and move around the office with good reception. Multitasking is a must for me and this headset enables me to do so.
3,"Wireless works well, sound quality poor","Highlights:Running Toktumi on a Mac running Snow Leopard.Item plugged in, worked immediately. No installation of software necessary.Moderately comfortable.SOund quality was for me quite poor in the headset. I had to strain to hear what people were saying, and the maximum volume was still not high enough.I actually called the company, and they sent me a replacement headset free of charge, but the problem was the same. Maybe this works well for very quiet offices?I ended up buying the Sennheiser office runner, which was about the same price, but is a far superior product. It has a better footprint on my desktop, you can manipulate the wireless configuration (channels) more, and the volume is more adjustable. The sound quality on the Sennheiser is far superior."
2,Worked fine until it failed... 3 days after purchase,"Set it up, it worked great for a little over 24 hours and the base unit failed to connect to my laptop. Returned and purchased a different item. Didn't want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing. Can't afford to be offline for as long as it will take to get this replaced.To be fair, I have used several Plantronics headsets and they were all great... my all time favorite is now 10+ years old and not compatible with Google Voice (though it does work great with Cisco IP phone). I also have a bluetooth Plantronics Voyager headset for my iPhone and it is also very good."
2,Didn't work for me,"I couldn't get it to work on my Windows XP computer (although it is supported) and when I did get it working on my Windows 7 computer, the sound quality was terrible. I could barely hear the person I was talking to and they couldn't hear me at all.Messed around with it a little bit, but there isn't a whole lot of tweaking to do. It either works or it doesn't.It seems to work fine for many people, so I gave them two stars instead of one. There are a lot of variables when computers and operating systems come in to play, so I didn't want to penalize them too much."
3,One main feature does not work. No remote ring or answer,The headset works great and does offer good range but the ring and answer function using the headset itself ONLY WORKS ONCE when my computer is rebooted. How's that one for weird. Talked to the company. They told me to return it but never did. I think the issue is software not hardware since the unit will work properly ONCE per reboot.
4,wireless freedom,This headset is comfortable and works great without having to worry about internal bluetooth settings. I'm actually purchasing a second one today for a work colegue.
1,Incompatibility issues,"I bought this to work with my company's communicator IP softphone on my laptop (my office phone on my laptop using VOIP because I work from various off-site locations). When nothing worked (I could neither hear nor could the other party hear me), I started to read the FINE PRINT that lists all the softphone programs that are NOT YET TESTED. And mine was listed. This phone must not have been designed with open architecture concepts! It would have been nice to know about the incompatibilities BEFORE shelling out a couple of hundred dollars for a headset! I'm thinking of trying the wired version but do not want to be stung twice at these prices. Very disappointed."
1,Not VOIP quality audio,"So, yes..the range is great, the headset is comfortable, but the audio quality is not good. If you're accustomed to high quality wired headset voip with your co-workers, and are on the quest for a wireless headset that can do that, you're probably out of luck. This is the third I've tried and all have failed in some way. :("
2,cabinet maker,The Mirka sand paper is a lower cost lower quality sand paper. The saying you pay for what you get is very true here. Some times you need a lower quality paper.
3,Brilliant music but...,"This is my favourite 70's Jazz album. It loses 2 stars because of the price which is very steep, even for an import.However its a marvellous quartet of musicians, featuring Keith Jarrett on Piano and Jan Garbarek on Sax. A wide range of styles from the Gospel influenced ""Long as Your..."" to frankly undefineable (but brilliant) pieces like ""The Windup"". Spiral Dance is another stand-out track. The key thing about this album, is that it is an entirely accoustic album, made in an era when the trend in Jazz was for more electric fusion based bands.The musicianship is of the highest order, and the compositions are mostly written by Jarrett. Unless you're a die-hard dixieland/trad fan there will be something here for you."
