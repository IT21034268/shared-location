3,"Wonderful Movie, Crummy DVD","Yes, I agree with my fellow reviewers in saying that I think the movie itself is practically perfect, filled with beauty, joy, wonder and hope. However, the DVD was indeed put together very poorly. The extras were only previews of old children's movies (one of them from when I was a kid 20 years ago). I would have liked a widescreen option and also the option to view it in the original Japanese with English subtitles, not to mention any possible extras, about the movie, in English. I think it was still worth buying and I would buy a better DVD again if it existed. Also, my nearly three year old daughter loves this movie as much as I do and watches it over and over with great enthusiasm."
5,We're a Totoro family,"We had this movie back when my boys were little - lost track of it - had let others borrow it for their kids - and havn't seen it since. When watching 'Toy Story 3' and Totoro makes an appearance my 18-year old son was hitting me up for a copy. My 13-year old daughter had never seen it (gasp!) so we had to get a copy. Its such a different-kind of movie. The characters are amazing - the imagination is astounding and yet, with the family with a sick mom in a far-away hospital, new house, new neighbors kids can relate. Very fun."
5,My Neighbor Totoro - a great family film,"An enchanting movie -- we owned it already in VHS, but wanted it in DVD to last longer -- we have 3 children ages 11 to 6, and they all love it. We expect to watch it for years to come."
5,"Weird, wonderful","Everyone I know who's seen this movie has loved it, be they children or adults. Lots of replay value, too...just buy it, you'll like it"
3,"Marvellous film, but beware this Fox release","Charm, wisdom and beauty - Miyazaki style. ""Totoro"" is a real winner for all the family, but I would advise prospective buyers to wait for the Disney/Buena Vista release later this year. This Fox version is full-screen, cutting down the viewing area, and is only available with English dubbed voices (the original Japanese with subtitles offers much more subtle performances for parental viewing!)"
4,Extrordinary Movie horible DVD,"To start off this was a great movie. I first saw this a couple years ago and I bought the original Japanese dvd. This dvd on the other hand is horrible. The movie is great for kids, anime freaks who are looking for something a little less gory, and famillys."
5,One of the Best,"I am a movie fan. I studied film in college many years ago (I know, big deal.) Anyway, my point is i LOVE good movies, and this is good -- one of the best. Animation or not, it is good because it is a good story. Watch it. Suspend disbelief. Go with it. It is a story of two small Japanese sisters just moved to a remarkable magical countryside with their professor dad while their mom recovers from an illness in the hospital. The sisters meet the magical characters that inhabit the area as they worry about their mom. The literary term ""magic realism"" come to mind as magic occurs as if such impossible things actually do happen every day. It happens, and it is reasonable in the world of these small children. More importantly it is a story of love. The real magic is about the love within the family."
4,Outstanding children's tale; good adult's tale.,"This movie is teeming with creativity and magic, but ultimately does not transcend enough beyond a kid's movie at times. I greatly enjoyed this film, moreso than any other film that I would classify as strictly for children. There are scenes that remind us of what childhood is like, and other scenes which take us on a fascinating journey. Yet it all ends to soon, with the usual song and dance we expect from a children's film.This is a great kid's movie, and one which most adults will enjoy. However, if you are looking for more serious fare, try Princess Mononoke, a little more serious work with a lot more to offer the thinking movie-goer."
5,fuzzy cat busses and giant bunny rabbit-cats,"I watched this movie with my 12 year old cousin Kris recently and was in perfect awe by how amusing and wonderful the story was. Kris showed me the cover and i was convinced it was only another kids movie. Immensly popular in Japan i have learned, i was stunned by the clean and excellent dubbing and music that added to the movie instead of making it sound awkward like many other anime that i have seen. set in the fourties in rural japan, i loved the almost realistic sceanery (spelling? oh well..) and the loveable and charictors that were not unlikly children.. all in all after i watched it, i wanted to go on a ride in a big cat-bus too!"
1,Leave it to Disney to screw up another great Anime,"I purchased this version (from Disney) because I thought they might have made a genuinely fantastic film even better... they certainly have the resources to do so... However, aside from a really nice new package, they unfortunately slaughtered it. The ""English"" translation from the original '80's version is the one you want, but good luck finding a copy on DVD. The ""new"" voices used by Disney are much inferior to the English-speaking voices used in the original translation. As usual, Disney took over the rights of this masterpiece for financial gain. In the process, they proceeded to destroy the aesthetic value of the delightful intent of the original."
3,An O.K movie,"The story is about two little girls Mei and Setsuki, and their father(their mother is in the hospital) who have moved into the country because.. I'm not too sure why. Mei then finds a big Totoro(a big fluffy animal,Totoro's come in all shapes and sizes). Than Mei and Setsuki have adventures with it. I thought that it was a cute movie for little kids 3-8. Also the movie had no plot which would leave older people finding it boring. I would recommend this movie for little kids."
3,Didn't hold my attention,"I recently saw ""Kiki's Delvery Service"" and really liked it and thought this would be just as good given the glowing reviews. I was wrong. My children(3 and 6) didn't even sit through half of it. I was bored early on and while the story seems cute and holds possibilities, I was very disappointed. I got really disturbed by the characters' huge mouths. My kids even commented on the funny faces and big open mouths. And one thing I have noticed about these anime cartoons (even family ones) is the little girls keep showing their underpants. I think it's a little creepy. On a lighter note, fans of the Rugrats will notice that the little girl is voiced by the same person who does Angelica."
3,Not much for adults ... but still great!,I wish that they would release more fanciful cartoons like this for adults and children.I bet the Original version had a more complicated story.
3,the cover is decieving,"i was expecting the cartoon to be as bright as the cover but i was sorely disappointed. the endless giggling annoyed me and my little sisters. the colors are just as dark and gloomy as any other japanese animated film. (excluding metropolis) im not bad mouthing japanese anime because i love the style. But this style did not suit this particular film. as i said before, the cover was decieving."
2,Under par with previous work from Miyazaki.,"Having seen Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, both breath-taking in all senses, Totoro comes way under par both in the plot and in the graphics, both of which I found over-simplified."
2,Most Boring movie Hayao Miyazaki ever made,This movie has lovely visuals and is great to watch if you are feeling depressed. However I think this movie is terrible. Why? It's boring and seems to be about nothing for the most part. I prefer Kiki's Delivery Service over this film. Great if you just want to see a serene countryside but if you are looking for entertainment I'll have to say this is the wrong kind of film.
5,Wonderful!,"This is a MUST SEE video!I have watched in in Japanese & English, and it is a classic. So much fun, the whole family really enjoys it! It is so much fun to sit with my kids and watch it.One comment to the Japanese person who wrote another review about stereotypes, lighten up! How many times have you seen the non-Japanese (Gaijin) depicted in your TV shows/Movies/Anime as ""large, loud, out of control, big nosed, rude, shall I go on? Lighten up!I found that the characters were very Japanese, and so lovable.Rant over.See this movie, you will not regret it, I promise!Cheers!Stuart Ablett Tokyo Japan"
2,Awful with changed voices and dialogues,"Bad and Dumb decision to change voices and dialgues. It's not the same movie anymore.This was my kids favorite movie, but now it's the worst one. They notice the voices've been changed.They don't like it. CHANGE IT BACK! We had to return the movie. I'm looking for the old version."
2,Different Voice Actors is a big mistake,I first learned of this movie in 1998 from a group of friends. Since it has been a favorite animated movie of mine and we spent a long time finding it on VHS at the time and then rented it recently on DVD. I purchased this Special Edition DVD when I bought Ponyo (another great movie).I watched this DVD the other day and something felt off right away. I finally grabbed the case and saw that the voice actors are not the same as the ones I was used to in the prior versions of the film. They also changed certain words and things that made it feel odd. It felt like the entire movie had been turned down in volume and the voices just didn't fit the movie. I was very disappointed and will now have to buy a used version with the classic voices. Just a warning for anyone that is a fan of this movie that you may be disappointed in the change like I was.
1,"Hackjob, didn't even deserve one star.","I am so grossed out by the voiceovers on this new version that I wanted to return it to the video store before I had listened to five minutes of it. I love the intro song on the fox version and have sung it to my children for years. I was shocked to hear the new gruffness in all of the voices in the entire video. I will never purchase Disney's version with the new voice-overs, preferring to stick to the good fox version instead."
2,Massively overrated,"I heard such glowing things about this but when I finally rented and watched it, I was bored out of my mind. Perhaps it means something in the context of Japanese folklore that I missed, but for its own sake it's not particularly clever (reminds me of _Through the Looking Glass_ only far less complex). I don't care about the dubbing; it could be silent and the story would still be uninteresting.I'm not a dedicated anime fan--I don't care who does the animation or in what style as long as the story is there--but I agree that the animation is really lovely."
4,A light hearted cartoon that the whole family can enjoy,"I have seen the original Japanese version. Totoro is also named as Dragon Cat:) Very very cute, just seeing the character is probably worth the DVD.The story is pretty slow paced and light hearted. If you are looking for some grand Disney style cartoon, this is not for you."
1,Give me the old charm,"I am returning the DVD and ordering the VHS. I wanted widesceen and vivid color, but the new version of the dubbing had my son in tears. Leave it to Disney to promote monsters (and the smart-mouthed children on the Disney Channel) over the beauty and simplicity of traditional Japanese lore. Two thumbs DOWN."
2,cast half circle scroll doormat,it was very wobbly if you didnt step on it in the near center it would tip.I thought I was getting a nearly black doormat as in the photo but it was very bronze it cost more in shipping back and forth that the actual price.
2,Worst Scenes.,"What would have been a great movie, but all the best love scenes don't get a chance to begin.Too much editing. It should have had a PG-13 rating.I am a collector of old classics. This is the worst I have ever seen."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"Wasn't real sure of this thing. As it turned out, it was an OK movie. The storyline could have been a bit deeper. As it was they took a fairly short story and stretched it out with a lot of filler. Beyond that, it is watchable although it was more of a 2 1/2 star effort in my opinion and not a complete waste as a lot turn out to be. Essentially this is a story about a possessive and sexually selfish husband, who cnnot or fails to satisfy his wife. There is only so much that can be done with this kind of plot I guess."
3,"Nice Try, But There Are Better Novels on the Same Topic","I am a bit obsessed with ancient Egypt, and was thrilled when my husband bought this book for me for my birthday. Essex writes fluidly, and is clearly an accomplished storyteller, but I ultimately found the novel disappointing. Kleopatra's early life is documented in painstaking detail (the novel takes you only as far as her first meeting with Julius Caesar as she is fighting for her kingdom), and yet the novel left me with a feeling of incompleteness (you don't find out until the end of this book that it is Part One of a series). For a much better treatment of the same topic (o.k., it's trashier, but also a lot more fun to read) see Colin Falconer's WHEN WE WERE GODS."
1,The Worst Book I Ever Read!,"I love ancient history and thought I would be entertained while learning about ancient Egypt. Wrong! The story was contrived and boring! Plus, it seemed as almost every other man had a ""fat ... that wobbled as he walked out the door."" I felt compelled to finish the book as I paid for it but I won't be buying the next two! Save your time and read about Kleopatra in the encyclopedia."
5,G-R-E-A-T,". . . The characters are believable, with real emotions, andthe story-line is fast-paced enough so that you stay interested. Theplot itself is unique, and it makes you wonder. ""The Only Alien On the Planet"" has been my favourite book since the 6th grade, almost four years ago. (And I have read hundreads more books, on my own reading level and up.) Read this book, you *won't* be dissapointed."
5,Min Muni,"My name is Amina and I am 14 years old. I found this book by accident, while searching in our school library for something to read. I was skimming the racks when it just caught my eye. Well, actually it was about to close so I had to rush out with a book checked out which I hadn't even glanced at yet. But once I read the first page, I fell in love with each and every single word. I didn't want to put it down, until I found out about Michael. And can you imagine I went so crazy over this book, I emailed the author and asked her all my questions I had stored in my brain, while reading. ...Bye! Keep on reading books!"
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK! MY FAVOURITE EVER!!!,"I love this book with all of my heart. It was the best book I've ever read. The plot is so... PERFECT, the way it fits together. I love all of Mrs. Randle's work, and hope she continues to write such indubitubly (?) wonderful books."
5,Outstanding!,"My roommate in college and I were both English majors. One night around eleven she walked out of our room while I was going in and said, ""I left a good book for you on the nightstand -- it's from my Adolescent Lit class."" Three and a half hours later I finished it. This is easily one of the most moving books I have ever read. The book begins in a seemingly normal setting, and then just when you get comfortable, it boosts you so far out of normal its amazing that Ms. Randle pulls it off. But she does, and she does it with a grace that is far too often absent in Young Adult fiction these days. The narrator has a wonderfully sincere and real tone. Her strengths, her fears -- her whole self shines through in the narration. The interpersonal relationships portrayed are right on the mark. I love this book. I think everyone should read it. It provides lessons for life that everyone should know."
3,The alien overview,"I thought that the book was O.K. It was about a boy that everyone thinks has mental problems. But he is a genius. The narrator in the book wants to find more about him. So she begins to invite him to everything that she goes to. He begins to open up to her until the climactic point when he reveals everything. It was a book that wasn't my favorite, but wasn't a waste of time."
5,The BEST BOOK EVER!,"I think this book should get more than 5 stars, more like 20! This is my #1 book! i loved it. It was amazing how Ginny could change Micheal (Smitty), a boy who hasn't talked for 13 years! also, i was amazed how Micheal stood up to his brother for the last time. I stayed up all night just to read this book. This was amazing! This is the BEST BOOK EVER! I'm going to email Kristen D. Randle about this book, to ask her if she made a sequal of it, or is going to. I LOVED THIS BOOK!"
5,You should give this book more then five stars!,"In this book A girl named Ginny moves to a new town and she meets a boy that hasn't talked in 13 years, they call him ""the alien"" because of this. Then she starts getting tudering from him and she starts to like him, which brings them closer and they fall in love. Then he gradually starts to talk again and he becomes just like another teenager.This book is a great book because even though this may never really happen it still teaches you about things that could, like when Ginny and Michael (the ""alien"") fall in love, and he recovers from not talking anymore and she is the reason that he talks again. I think that someone could really over come something because of someone else. Ginny is a very independent person and when she wants something done she will do anything to get there. I think it just takes someone like her to do something what she did, she could be a romodel to others."
5,A very insightful book,I found it very insightful on how we judge and treat other people who are different.Kristen is a very talented author.
5,Will make you think...,"A total ten!! A truly thought-provoking, intense & emotional book. I am having my dtr (11) read this book and the discussions will be endless. It opens up dialogue between parents & kids about common misconceptions and snap judgements that we ALL make on a daily basis, sometimes unintentionally, sometimes on purpose. I would say this is more geared to a 6th grader or older unless you judge your child otherwise. Fine for younger, but read it as a parent first. I came across this book years ago and was thrilled to find it on Amazon! I don't want to give away any of the story, I will just leave it as a must read for everyone!"
5,"Great work, great photography and writing!","I really love a how-to book that uses great photos to illustrate. This book is perhaps that best that I have seen in this regard. The photos are simply superb. I think photos in a book like this should be one part ""eye candy"" to draw interest, and two parts used to illustrate a point or to inform. Again, this book is the best I've seen on this point.The writing is also excellent. Its well researched and well written in a simple, yet pleasing style. Of course, if you're into growing giant pumpkins this book is absolutely essential, and you probably have it, or should get it. If you're not into pumpkins but want to write a ""how-to"" book, get this one to see the best."
3,Only the essnetials.,"I really like Lewis and Clark, if you want a very direct and to the point rendition of their journals this is it. There are no accompying maps, graphs, anything to help you understand and fulfill the data put forth by the explorers. This book has no pictures, and is composed entirely of the cut-down portions of their journals. There was a decent amount of interaction for the journals, and included some harrowing tales of the travelers running into Indians."
4,This book is GREAT!,"I am just now starting to get into researching about Lewis And Clark and was reccomended this book at the local library. I seriously loved the book. It really cut down on the ""need to know"" essentials. It's incredible the intricate detailing of their journey. It's so funny to see how life back then tends to mirror life now with the same problems and situations.Really loved the book!"
3,Close but not not 5 Stars,"Price was good, packaged like a keyboard should be. The unit had a loose key, may have been from mfg process or re-mfg process as i have a completely unsubstantiated hunch. Other than that keyboard was as described. item was reported to be shipped the same day, Item did not actually ship for almost a week after that. Disappointed with that aspect of the shipping. All was well in the end as the unit functioned properly and looked brand new."
3,Dell Latitude D610 Replacement keyboard,"I received the keyboard after not being able to ship it to Alaska; so I had to ship it to my brother in the lower 48 to then have him ship it to AK. Not convenient to say the least. It took forever for me to receive the product. That was not spectacular.When I received it, I looked it over to make sure it was clean and the right model before I took the computer apart to find it didn't fit (like last time). It seems to be fine but it is not clean. It seems quite used and the little mouse pad in the center is really grungy. I was not impressed at all with that. I figured it would at least be cleaned up and stuff.It is a step up from my old keyboard which I had from 2005-2012 with constant use .... but not by much. At least it wasn't very overpriced. I know this is an old model so there aren't many options available to purchase the correct keyboard either. But I had hoped for more.I just hope it works when I install it later today."
3,Doesn't detach,"One thing Intec forgets to mention about this product is that once you attach it to your GB you can't take it off again without breaking it. And because its solid, it can get in the way of light when you don't need the one that comes on the shield, making it desirable to remove sometimes. Its a great product... So long as you never want to take it off!"
4,Wonderful Case,"I really couldn't have asked for anything better. A solid, well made case that protected my set of harps through quite a few mishaps. It is much less expensive than a hardshell, and though it will not fit a microphone or anything else other than the harmonicas and a few pieces of paper, it was well worth it. A strap would have been nice, and the large ""LEE OSKAR HARMONICAS"" on the front could have been smaller."
4,Minimalist case great for gigs,"This was a gift for my minimalist musician boyfriend, who plays out and likes to keep it simple. He popped it full of Special 20s and has been very pleased with the case. It is not a hardshell, but if you are sitting on your harmonica case (as one reviewer complained), you have other problems! Recommended for working musicians."
2,Cheap and Over priced,"This is a very cheap case, hard canvas material that will do nothing to protect your harps if someone sits on the case. The tight elastic bands that hold the harps make it difficult to put them/out w/o concern for damaging your plates or comb; I ordered the solid Hohner case, holds more harps and although costs more will protect my investments much more."
4,"Very fast, very tight, disappointingly short.","I got this after hearing ""Show No Mercy"" a while back and found it thoroughly excellent. Highlights are, of course, Angel of Death, and Raining Blood, however, despite the towering standard of musicianship and talent given by this work, I can only give it a four star rating. Why? Because it's TOO FSCKING SHORT."
5,Something about drums to tell I love fall out boy,"OK they are not banging on a garbage can it is called a bass drum. Drums are used to keep time and keep a steady ryhthm for the bass and the guitar to play to. By the way if you gave ""the number of the beast"" by iron maiden a bad review you would be cussed out in a second. Cause they have a huge fan base unlike fall out boy good charolette etc."
4,Passion? I'll show YOU passion...,"Hmm...Korn as a band with PASSION!?!?! WTF!?! Well, I guess musicians who take endorsements from Puma and drive their own souped-up BMWs and get their clothes for free can still fool mindless fans.""Reign in Blood"" is a snapshot of a band at its meanest and hungriest. No million dollar contracts. No endorsements. Just pure, primal RAGE!!!"
4,The original Slayer,This cd is not the best Slayer cd in my opinion but dont get me wrong it is truly a classic. 28 minutes of a brutal metal assault delievered by none other than the best in metal. Songs like Raining blood and Criminally Insane are the best on this Cd. Raining Blood is the Slayer trademark. It defines what Slayer fans know as the best in metal. The begining of this song into the opening riffs makes you want to yell SLAYER. This cd falls in with Slayer's best like Seasons and South of Heaven. The reason for the four stars is it ranks 3rd amongst the 3. If you like true heavy metal done by the best then buy this cd. Some think this was the standard Slayer set for everybody else. I dont agree fully but it comes close.
4,"Very Good, but a mute button for the vocals would be nice","Instrumenation hits the over-drive button with a new and daring sonic twist in this blaring, full-throttle blistering set. The only problem is the tell-tale marks of ignorance in the lyrics in which Jesus is the scapegoat for their personal woes and societal injustices.funnything is, I thought that SATAN was the one who came to ""steal, kill and destroy"" ?While they are obviously not well grounded or versed in their doctrine, they nonetheless are skilled with music virtuosity, and the production effort from the supremely gifted Rick Rubin, enables the final mix to superscede previous death metal outings, from ""Slayer"" themselves, to their scores of inferior copy-cats.Brutal, but creative and sonically rewarding.Very good, but a mute button for the vocals would be nice."
5,Second to none!,"One of the best if not the best thrash metal albums of all time. If you are a metal fan and dont have this already, get it the next time you are in a record store, no metal collection is complete without this alltime, legendary classic from the metal gods who are Slayer."
5,One of the greatest of all time,"What can you say other than brillant. This is slayer, of course it is great. Reign in Blood is prehapes the greatest album of all time. Supersonic thrash with satanic lyrics. I love it. This is the album that put thrash on the map, and it has always been the anthem for thrash.Trust me, you can't go worng with this one.Angel of Death*****Piece by Piece*****Necrophobic****Altar of Sacrifice (tied with raining blood for #1)*****Jesus Saves*****Criminally Insane*****Reborn****Epidemic****Postmortem****Raining blood*****agressive Prefector****Criminally insane (remix)****"
4,The Classic Slayer album - a must have.,"While my personal favorite Slayer is Divine Intervention, no one can call themselves a fan without knowing every syllable of Reign in Blood. It's the first ""must have"" album for a myriad of reasons. You can skip (but really shouldn't) Show No Mercy, and Hell Awaits and go right to Reign in Blood and understand what this band is all about musically (though, if you're a fan at all you'd better have Seasons in the Abyss).The combination of violent speed metal with riffs that are the aural equivalent of a ton has seldom been done better than here - even by Slayer themselves. Angel of Death, Necrophobic, and the delightful Jesus Saves are reasons enough to listen to this reckless joyride. Get on!"
5,"Too bad you can only select five stars, this one deserves 10","Quite simply, Reign in Blood is THE high water mark for all metal albums. INCREDIBLY fast guitars and drums will shred your speakers and ears to dust for 29 brutal minutes. Worth every penny spent on it"
5,The BEST album EVER made.,"This is the greatest album ever made. Not just the greatest speed metal, or metal, or rock album ever made. It's the greatest album ever made, period.You don't believe me? Buy it and listen. Then go buy Ferris' book,Slayer's Reign in Blood (33 1/3), and find out why it's so awesome.This album is ~22 years old and still sounds as good as the day it was made. Slayer defines the genre of metal and this album defines Slayer.Buy it now, don't be a jagoff."
5,BEST SLAYER CD !!,"IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A METAL HEAD THEN YOU PRABABLY ALREADY HAVE THIS CD, IF NOT GO BUY IT NOW.This album is more or less 30 minutes but it is worth every seconds.Sure the production is not up to date (the album is20 years old!!) but even today i think this album is the most angriest heaviest metal album of all time."
4,holy s*** get it,i love this band and this is the best work they have ever created so if you like to hear what the music of hell sound like go out and get it. it is speed metal and lets face it kerry king is the guitar god
3,Too much hype,"While Slayer will never go down in history as a great band, I think that their main contribution comes from being a bridge between traditional ""speed metal"" and the more niche-bound ""death metal"" bands. Although RiB is Slayers fouth album (if I remember correctly), I think it was their first release on a major lable.There are two tracks that are pretty good: ""Angel of Death"" and ""Raining Blood."" Everything else on the album is relatively non-spectacular. Slayer is infamous for their cool riffs but terribly lame solo work. Speed and shocking lyrics are really all they have going for them. I think a lot of Slayer's popularity derives more from their image and their own hype than their music (as is pretty obvious from the non-objective reviews posted here).If you're already a nostalgic speed/death metal fan, than RiB is worth having just for its historical value, to appreciate for what it is. Otherwise, it's not really all that great."
5,metal masteripece,"it doesnt take an idiot to know this cd is amazing. takes awhile to get used to though, to actually understand the band u guys gotta see'em live seriously."
2,Kerry King Sucks,If anyone knows anything about music theory you can plainly see that Kerry King's solos are so horribly out of chord that it makes the notes painful to hear. King has the talent to go off but not the talent to write good music. Other than that Slayer has their own style and if you like their style you will like it but i dont see how anyone could every say that Kerry King is good musician.....thats a joke.
2,Where is the talent?,"First of all, the only reason this CD gets 2 stars is because 1 star rating is reserved for Limp Bizkit-type bands. This CD is nothing more than pounding, pounding, and more pounding. Lyrics sound like 6th grader wrote them. If musical assault means beating drums as fast as you can and yelling ""Hell, Suffering, Evil.."" as many time as possible, and for guitar player to try to play as fast as he can not carrying about how melodic the riffs are, than this is the CD for you. This can't even begin to compare to most Panthera's work, let alone to old Metallica's masterpieces ""Ride the Lightning"" and ""Master of Puppets"".[...]"
3,Vocal Issues...,"I really like the instrumentals this band has to offer...they'd be a really good band in my estimation if they would lose the vocals...In most instances the vocals seemed forced and rather unimaginative...blood, death, Satan, blah, blah, blah...I guess SLAYER just wouldn't be the same without the lyrics though...who would fundamentalist Christians have to complain about...If I could buy the album without the vocals it would get 5 stars."
3,What's all the fuss about?,"I've been hearing things like this is the best album EVER,whoa,that's a pretty big standard to live up to...well,it's failed,greatly. There's nothing ""extraordinary"" here, just another album. I've listened to it like 10 times,trying to see what's so special about it, and i don't see it. Sure,there's some good riffs,and some okay drumming,and the cover art is pretty cool,but that's all. Best song is without a doubt Angel of Death. But seriously, bands like ""Death of Millions"" and ""Pandemia"" are..better than Slayer. Of course you've probably never heard of them. So it goes. One of the most overrated bands in the metal world continues to get respect they don't really deserve. I can understand how,at the time,this must have been an amazing album to listen to,but in this day and age,there's stuff 100 times more Brutal,sick,and fast. Oh well. I bought this album with my brother's money and still havn't payed him back,so i guess i didn't lose much."
2,BORING,"Every song sounds the same, no different beats or nothing, just screaming and the same drum beat everytime. This album is terrible. I give it 2 stars just for reign in blood, because that song rulez!!!!! If you want REAL metal, go buy Metallicas Ride The Lightning"
2,Congratulations on being the #1 overated album of all time.,"Over the years I have been able to listen to a good number of Slayer songs here and there. A lot of songs from Show No Mercy and Seasons in the Abyss I thought were pretty good. After reading on just about every heavy metal page that Reign in Blood was one of the best heavy metal albums ever, I thought that I would go ahead and try it out. Let me start off by saying that Reign in Blood does contain some pretty good rythm riffs, but other than that I don't see what all the hype is about. First off, the vocals suck. Never thought that the lead singer for Slayer was that great, but on this album he really sucks. 2nd, the Lead guitar work sucks, nothing but random spurts of noise. Not one of the solos seemed to have any soul put into it at all. 3rd the lyrics are way too korny and childish. I will admit that several of the main riffs caught my attention, but after the last song was over I was glad the album was only about 30 minutes long."
1,Laughable..,"Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Metallica collection, but this still sounds like a joke to me. Thin production, grating, buzzsaw guitars and some of the fakest, hilarious and downright awful lyrics I've ever heard. This is not a classic, it's childs play and sounds like it was thrown together by a bunch of 9 year olds in their bedroom.If anything, this is an insult to 9 year olds! Barking lyrics about Satan doesn't make you a metal band or scary, but I rate ""Reign In Blood"" 1 star for comedic value.And this is considered their best work? Wow."
5,Slayer are one of the few good 80's metal bands!,"This album is worth every cent. Listen to it, and you will be hooked from start to finish!"
5,A THRASH FAN!!!!,"WOW,all i can say is WOW!!,what a killer cd here,from that opening riff to Angel of Death,to the closing riff to Raining Blood,it never lets up,if your in the mood for the thrashiest metal ever,BUY THIS!!,Also check out Sepultura - Beneath The Remains,Great cd there."
5,Pure speed metal,Your not a true metal fan if you dont have this album very influential to me. The guitars are killer on this album. My favorite song is angel of death even though every song is good on the album.
2,.....And I can tell you why....,"First off, I'n not giving this album 2 stars because they're not talented. They are all great musicians, and I respect them for that.It's the lyrics. All Slayer does is yack and yack about their Anti-Christ beliefs alum after album, and that makes me sick. I mean, they even ha ve an album titled ""God Hates Us All"" (How did they get away with that?) I can only take so much of that. People may think it's fun to listen to, but people like me take it seriously. That goes for other bands as well, such as: Goatwhore, Cannibal Corpse, Exhumed, Cradle of Filth, Mortician etc. ...; there's still good stuff out there that doesn't focus on Satanism.P.S. Don't get me wrong, I am not a big religious person, but an music that have lyrics like this are ridiculous."
1,Stupid,"What can I say? This crap is horrible. It's just a bunch of screaming around but because they play instruments people call it music. I could start my own death metal band. All I would have to do is turn on a lawnmower and scream and moan into a microphone, pay someone to bang on a trashcan, then record it and sell it to mindless losers."
3,Overrated,"Slayer's most overrated album, definatly much better thrash acts out there, go search some up. There is really only two noteable tracks on here, which I'm sure you all know. Every other song just blends in with the CD, and it will get boring. My friend even believed the whole CD was one song, when I played it over his house."
2,Don't expect much,"This was the beginning of the bad for Slayer. Angle of Death is the only good song on the album. The rest of the songs are all way too short and they all sound the same for those of you looking for a good slayer album check out ""Show no Mercy."" It's a great album and its full killer guitar riffs."
2,This album is just bad.,"Are you kidding me?Are you guys really all blind?This album stinks. This gives metal bad name. Full of blind speed, horrible and stupid lyrics, and where is diversity?This is one of the most boring cd I have ever tried. You want to enjoy real heavy but smart thrash? Try Old (yes, old) Metallica or Old Megadeth. If you just want to give a shot to Slyer, try Seasons in the abyss.All guys who says that Reign in blood is the true masterpiece, please wake up~! This cd is just for 11-year-old kids pretending to be metalheads."
1,Dead People Are Fools,People buy this album not knowing what it is? If star ratings are pretty points; this album gets just one. The only question for someone who bought this and couldn't stand it would be: What the hell were you listening to in the mid eighties?....and regarding the satanism ~ please: They are mercenaries; filling a hole.
1,"Actually ""0""","Well done guys- you've succeeded in showing us a great vocal range of ""zero"" octaves- ranting line after line in an ""inspiring"" monotonous gruff tone, banged all of one drum for 28 minutes and used at least ""two"" whole strings of guitar- and you've wrapped it all up in a nice satanist friendly kiddie package"
1,Ladies and Gentlemen: MUSIC DOESN'T GET WORSE THAN THIS!!!!,"It should first be established that this is not even music PERIOD, this is a ludicrous bedlam of tactless, senseless, depraved, vile, indiscernible, untalented racket that anybody could do by concentrating as much noise as possible together and then adding screaming shouts. This is about as bad as Cannibal Corpse.Anybody that recommends this travesty of music has SERIOUS problems on all echelons of their sanity!Nobody in their right mind would give this a good rating. In fact. Even if the lyrics weren't so bad, more enjoyment can come from hearing construction work than this LUNACY. Take my advice, don't listen to anyone giving this 5 stars, because their musical tastes are SERIOUSLY WARPED.This has another name ""the music from hell"". It's not even worth checking out. And if you happen to, you'll regret it."
1,if i wanted metal id listen to limp bizkit or spice girls.,"Slayer is the worst band in existance, they are talentless and they suck at drumming. they are over rated and they werent as influential as the great jon davis or kirk cobain!!!naplam death is pop punklimp bizkit is thrash metaland iron maiden ripped off papa roachRemember for talent, stick with eminem, ja rule, 50 cent, mariah carey, spice girls, hanson, blink 182, good charlotte, andunfortunately this is my last review. I would love to continue, but for personal reasons I must quit.many of you remember me as bernard thomas, henry mcpruter, sunburnt albino... etc well My days are over.nothing in life lasts forever. happy thanksgiving. and good luck"
1,Wat The F*ck,"ok let's start of by saying that i have been in the music industry as production technician for over 35 years. I have worked with such bands as Kiss, Ac/Dc, Poison, Loverboy, Fear Factory, Systematic, Hatebreed etc. And i have to say great bands such as ""Slayer"" are legends...... but thats about as far as it goes. They need to step aside and make room for the younger generation because they just don't seem to have what it takes anymore. This has to be the last straw for them because it just doesn't get any worse then this. I am sorry for the rude awakening, but lets all be realistic. If you waste money on this album you are a fool. Legends ""Yes"", Rockstars ""No""."
3,"Fast, Powerful Metal — Mind-Numbingly Irritating Vocals","I'm gonna make this short and simple...Reign in Blood CAN be ranked alongside thrash greats like Master of Puppets and Rust in Peace, but I won't. If you could take out all vocals from the entire album, THEN I might..."
5,The supreme thrash record,"While Spiritual Black Dimensions may be the greatest black metal release, this is the best thrash album ever created. Not a single record I've heard has yet to match the speed, intensity and chaotic feeling of this record. It's so fast, the whole thing only clocks in at around 20 minutes. Favorite song: Postmortem."
5,Time for my 2 cents worth...,"Not much to say other than that this is an absolute classic thrash album. Although we're painfully aware of what Slayer has digressed to in their last 3 albums, this album alone keeps people coming back to their shows. There's 10 songs on here and there's not one that is bad. Ignore all the negative criticisms from the 13 year old Linkin Park fans/Hot Topic patrons, this is a kick ass record from start to finish. \m/\m/"
3,Came Broken.......,"The CD itself is amazing! Plays great, no problems, but the case came broken, which I'm a bit disappointed in... Be a bit more careful next time."
5,what a classic thrash metal album,"i got a lot of respect for slyer being the one of the only truethrash metal bands around [unlike metallica,sellouts!] i hopethey release another album soon lots of respect to the real guys"
5,"fast, hard, powerful",this album is sick!!!! i have never heard a band that shreds as powerful as slayer. kerry king and jeff hanneman are the greatest guitar duo in metal. tom araya has the ability to sing so fast without damging clarity. if u dont have it buy it cause your missing out favorites include...idk every damn song!!!
5,Only one thing to know about this cd...,"When it comes to Reign in Blood, all you need to know is that it is the best. I'm sorry to be blunt but who really cares if there are ""other"" artists out there with ""other"" cds because to be perfectly honest, i don't even need to listen to them to know that they are FAR FAR FAR inferior to this masterpiece. No one has ever and will ever come within miles of this cd, and to those who think otherwise you are very very wrong at the very least. Slayer created my god when they recorded this monster and no mortal can aspire to this because no one else is that good. No one is even close to being this good, not within light years. Nirvana? Metallica? Korn? Dave Matthews? Led Zeppelin? The Beatles? Who cares how good they are by themselves because none of them are even close to being as good as Slayer was when they made Reign in Blood and still is today. End of discussion, if you feel otherwise your wrong, thats all there is to it"
5,The BEST Thrash album ever made by humanity.,"Well... this album... first of all, CLEAN production , ultra-fast guitar riffs and chaotic solos , very very fast drummming by master Lombardo, and some of the most known songs of metal history makes this cd the BEST thrash metal cd ever and probably the best metal cd made in the 80's, just PERFECT agression."
3,"To some, the best. But I found it boring.","This album is considerd by many to be Slayer's best. It's fast, heavy, brutal and evil, some of the songs on here are classics, and for many, this is the album that represents everything Slayer's supposed to be. I completely disagree. I've been a Slayer fan for almost ten years and to me, this album is the most boring of the bunch. The album starts off sweet, with Angel of Death -- a crunching anthem about the horrors of the holocaust -- and ends with Raining Blood, which is typical of Slayer's Clive Barker type horror metal (which is cheesy but never gets old for some reason). In between there's not much to offer. Not only is this album very short (at about 30 mins) but there's nothing very original going from song to song. I don't regret buying this album, I just regret that it's not better."
2,reign in what?,"Yes, Reign in Idiocy! Or at best Reign in Boredom. All songs sound the same. What do these guys think they do?"
3,It's okay,"I don't like this like seasons, seasons is real good and I'm stuck on that now but I'll listen more later and see what's up with reign in blood then I'll get back bye"
5,A must for Slayer fans,"This album is completely devoid of commercial (sell) elements that came into effect during the South of Heaven and subsequent albums. Its Slayer at their best with no BS..insane guitar and vocal speed with the classic distortion and signature Slayer sound. Its their fastest effort and each song is a classic by itself. I will add that if you are an Abyss fan, you may not ike this one...its classic Slayer, not MTV Slayer."
1,Am I listening to the same song?,"I love metal. Especially thrash and speed metal, but this is the most overated album of all time. On this piece of turd, all of Slayer's songs sound the same. I was listening to it and I thought I was listening to the same song untill I looked at my walkmen and it showed another track. What the f--k? Oh and Kerry King is the worst guitatest EVER."
2,what ?????????,"ok, i'll say a few words. what exactly is this? i guess if you want NOISE, buy it. traditional speed metal is not what this cd is about, this cd is about nothing. bad all around. deathrow inmates would love it, the average metal head? NOT. if you want ""doom metal of sorts"" spend your money on a lesser known chicago band named trouble. their self titled 1990 release, if you can find it is definitely worth whatever you pay. slayer just missed the boat trying to outdo megadeth & metallica. if they slowed the tempo of this cd way down, i guess i could call it worthy."
1,want thrash with talent - try Rust In Peace,"This is one of talent-less bands, nothing but a wall of noise.How do they know one song from another I just cannot fathom.Megadeth and early Metallica are thrash with mucisianship.Slayer and Kreator are all else."
1,oi vey reviewers are stupid as hell...,"normally I don't review things but I will in exception here. Alot of Slayer talk has been tied in here with Children of Bodom, Metallica, and Linkin Park.What the hell kids? Metallica is a whole different world from slayer...a MUCH better world. Linkin Park is an entire different genre that doesn't belong in any conversation with metal. And yes Slayer paved the way for bands like Children of Bodom...and sadly we have to live with bands like COB.you can listen to good hard metal without having to listen to slayers bs. Listen to Metallica, Megadeth, Dream Theater, Iced Earth, Deamons and Wizards. Want to hear a band that plays music 4 times the speed of slayer and plays it better?...DragonForce. ALL OF THESE BANDS CAN BE FOUND ON THIS SITE!!! LOOK EM UP!O yeah and this album...same song over and over...same boring lame song over and over...the drums are the death of this album."
5,Still Reigning in 2007!!,"This is one of the only bands that started hard and they will end hard!!With little to no air play on radio, Slayer has proven they are one of the hardest metal bands in the industry.When other bands have gone more commercial Slayer has stayed true to their roots.My rating for this CD is a 5 of 5 stars!!"
4,Slayer Slays,"This is what thrash metal is all about. There are a lot of fan favorites on here that are still performed live to this day. Angel of Death is perhaps one of Slayer's most infamous and brutal tunes. Note how they do not condone nor condemn the Nazi madman. They are like reporters, they just tell it like it is (or how it was). Yes Slayer is a dark musical journey and you have to take it with a grain of salt. I don't believe that Slayer are devil worshippers, nor do I believe they are influnenced by demons as a fellow reviewer stated. They are just being Slayer. They right fast agressive thrash and their 'gimmick' is evil. Pure and simple.Reign in Blood ranks as one of the finest and most influential thrash/speed metal albums of all time."
5,best metal cd ever,"30 minutes of the best thrash metal ever. crisp recording, great overall vibe. shreds. doesnt get better."
5,This is what metal is made out of!!!!!!!!!!,"Slayer is without a doubt is anyone's is one the greatest advances in mind the birth of metal(next to Black Sabbath,Metallica,Venom,and Death).Reign In BLood is the of of the heavyest albums ever.And for all of you that say they aren't talented try playing a double bass drum while flaming beat with the tempo at 200!it's not easy!I've been plaing for 3 years and I can't come close to Slayer! or guitar at 200!These are the kings of metal.And the lyrics are some of the greastest ever.If Slayer and the rest did'nt come along every metal rocker would be like Linkin Park and Avril Lavine(Possers!).IN short ladies and gentlemen this is a must have for anyone that wants heavy.Other bands you may like Venom,Death,Napalm Death, and Metallica,.Thank you."
4,I am reviewing this again....,"ok,i'm changing my old review, i know i gave this cd 2 stars before, but i just can't stop listening to it now. This is probably the fastest and heaviest(but not the best) thing you will ever hear. I love their speed, and I know they're one of the most important metal bands ever, but I don't think they are as good as Megadeth or Metallica. This album does sound a little repetitive. It lacks the diversity of any album by Metallica, but I can still listen to this cd sometimes. It gets 4 stars because it doesn't have as much diversity as I would like."
5,One of the most brutal CD's ever!,"This CD rocks! Slayer are the kings of brutal heavy metal. This CD has the most harcore drums that rattle so fast, the heaviest and most thrashing guitars, a sick low rythmic bass, and twisted, sick, vocals that blair! This CD is for the lovers of insane, heavy, brutal, thrashing metal. Buy it, it rocks!"
1,BELONGS IN THE GARBAGE! THIS IS NOT GOOD THRASH METAL!,"THIS ALBUM GOES BEYOND MONOTONOUS AND BORING! AFTER LISTENING TO THEIR SEASONS IN THE ABYSS AND SOUTH OF HEAVEN RECORDS WHICH WAS MY FIRST EXPOSURES TO THE BAND, I WAS INTERESTED IN CHECKING OUT MORE OF THEIR STUFF EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE ALL OF THE SONGS ON THOSE ALBUMS, BUT ""REIGN IN BLOOD"" WAS AWWWWWFUL AND I COULDN'T THINK OF GIVING IT A SECOND CHANCE IN MY STEREO! :( THERE IS AB-SOL-UTELY NO VARIETY ON ANY OF THESE SONGS - THE SOLOS SUCK TOO - I AM GLAD THIS WASN'T THE FIRST ALBUM OF THEIRS I HEARD! THIS ALBUM GIVES THRASH METAL A BAD NAME. IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO SOME GREAT THRASH METAL CHECKOUT SOME OF THE STUFF BY BANDS LIKE ANNIHILATOR, OVERKILL, VICIOUS RUMORS, HELLOWEEN, TESTAMENT, DELIVERANCE, ANTHRAX, ARMORED SAINT, SOME OF MEGADETH'S STUFF, OLD FATE'S WARNING (LIKE ""NO EXIT"" AND ""AWAKEN THE GUARDIAN"") AND OLD (AND I STRESS OLD) METALLICA (""AND JUSTICE FOR ALL"" AND PRIOR)."
1,It must be a white thing becuase I don't understand,"This is a classic album please lololol. I listen to a variety of music from Soul,Funk to Punk, Nu Wave and Thrash and the dreaded Disco, but I laughed my head off on this album the only thing scary when my friend played this album for me was when the dogs would stop howling.The only cut worth listening to on this so-called ""masterpiece"" (as if talking about satan, nercophillia and murder is such a big thrill)was ""raining blood"". The musicianship and lyrics are poor and the singing is even worse. If anybody is blown away by this so-called band listen to Megadeth, Bad Brains or early Metallica. I gave it one star for the comicial lyrics and the album cover is interesting It must be a white suburban thing becuase I don't understand."
2,Talentless and repedative,"Listen to one song and you have Slayers entire career. This band is nothing but a bunch of guys that aren't smart enough to do anything besides band instruments and sing the same voice over and over again.Just because they are old doesnt make them good. I gave them an extra star because without the vocals there is some nice background music here.If you want a band that grows into something better with each Cd, then try Slipknot or Otep."
1,all sounds the same,all the songs sound the same plus they are pretty evil of a band(just look at that album names) plus the songs just have fast beats and fast guitar and thats it... and it has some singer growling really instead of singing. dont buy this album
4,winners,"Slayer really came through to me on my headphomes. They talked to me through their music and made me stronger. Granted, the music is about the devil and I don't like him much, but all the same, I was able to pedal my bike a lot faster on my paper route because he was in my head. This band wins."
4,This goes out to hydonymous,"I haven't listened to the full CD yet. I'm sure it's pretty good, even if it is violent. This particular review is directed at ""hydonymous"". Please don't review that genre if u don't like it. Help others who read these reviews to make an educated decision on whether or not to buy this CD. If u don't like metal, that's cool with me. But NO ONE wants to hear about it when u type the exact same review for different CDs. I read ur other reviews. You freaking copied and pasted them! Please don't review metal anymore."
5,metaly goodness,"very nice cd. much of the killy death kill you dead with killing killyness and fret pounding killitude typical of killer. oops, I mean slayer. heh heh. muy bueno"
2,"Not bad, but not as great as some suggest.","While this isn't a bad CD, it's just not that great. I would have give it 2.5 stars if I could have. Of course Lombardo is drumming incredibly fast and powerful, and the guitars are blisteringly fast and heavy. Tom Araya's vocals are not all that great, just shouting. Of course as brutal as these songs are I can't really picture the vocals being any other way. But it's too much of the same thing, not a whole lot to set each track apart from the others. I think Seasons blows this one away."
2,at best mediocre,"I bought this cd, then I was disappointed. That's all. This is very short and very boring. Why? Because all songs sound the same. With brutality? Yes. With speed? Sure. And with Idiocy? ABSOLUTELY! I always liked Old(yes, old) Metallica, ACDC, Black Sabbath. But this cd is just full of fast noise. (Maybe drumming is the only part worthy of listening) If you are starting to like metal, just avoid this cd. There are many other ecommendable cds. Don't be e-fooled by reviews from their blindly addicted fans."
2,only one good song.,"Only one good song, Raining blood. Metallica's Master of puppets and Megadeth's peace sells crap all over this. And oh yeah, ""fallout boy lover"", you said Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera are poser bands and too hard. Well those three bands were awsome and influenrtial, fallout boy and green day is for whimps. Green day is poser rock."
3,good,"reign in blood is pretty good. however, the music itself is lacking in the crunchy sound that has made thrash metal popular. Anthrax and Metallica are much better, darker, and scarier."
2,LA posers,"Slayer is a bunch of party-guys who have trained hard at playing their thrashy guitars. They are as fast on this album as they probably are on their feet chasing around after girls on the beach. And the singer delivers the dark lyrics with a soft voice, probably calculated to reach a wider audience. Not much of personality in the music; and they have stolen parts from other records, like Death's Leprosy and Megadeth's Peace Sells for example, records with real artistic value.If you want good metal try Symbolic, Sound of Perseverance, and Human by Death."
1,Brilliant...,"(Not a kid, just don't have an account).Something tells me that Metallica, Megadeth, the loathsome Slayer, and the rest of the genre could have achieved as much musicality if they were playing jackhammers and chainsaws as opposed to musical instruments. Do you self deluded morons really think speed metal was about controversy and rebellion? It was about finding a new way of separating a bunch of gullable, immature fools from their money. Mission accomplished.""Pogo on dudes! Duh!"""
3,An Interesting piece of work...,"This CD features NO MUSIC of the Deftones, and features a British woman reading a biography of the Deftones. I found it interesting, and I was for the most part, happy with my purchase, I'm a Deftones freak, and it was an import that I didn't have, so no matter how bad it was, I was going to buy it anyways. This is for the most part a interesting CD, every track it features Chino saying something for maybe 5 seconds, and if this isn't what you want, than don't buy it. It does come with a free pin-up poster though."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!,"This CD was extermely dissappointing, it features a British woman basically reading a bio on the Deftones. It really doesn't have anything with the members speaking!!!! Don't waste you money on this UK joke!!!!"
3,Not Again!,Okay- THis book is GOOD but not SO good. Its just like another one of her books- in texas-and it has all these mushy things like- oh babay! r u ok? :( but all in all- it was better then some of her other books. it wasnt just a mother and daughter- and there was a TOTALLY diff theme. a father whos going for governer. thats what i liked bout this book. a TOTALLY diff theme- but it still had TEXAS . sometimes i thgink taht the characters will meeetr one another in some books cuz thats where their livin. same place! :) otherwise- it was a good book
4,An edge of your seat novel!,"When Cary's father announces he'll be running for governer of Texas, she knows she'll be the center of attention. But when she starts getting followed in her car and getting calls in the middle of the night, she begins to realize this sort of thing does not fit in with the tasks of being the governers daughter. After some careful research with her reporter friend, she has the suspects narrowed down to a few people. She also remembers over hearing what may have been a private conversation.Soon she is almost certain who her stalker is. She just doesn't know what to do about it. What she desides to do will keep you at the edge of you seat for the rest of the book. The book had a series of creepy event that eventually lead up to a great ending. I liked the book because it was full suspence and it was really hard to put down. I would recomend it to anyone that likes mysery or suspense. You should definatly read it!"
5,You just have to read this one!,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is exciting and has a great ending. A Candidate for Murder is about a girl named Cary, whose father is running for governor of Texas. Cary knows that her life will become more hectic but she has no idea to what extent. Soon she starts to get creepy phone calls in the middle of the night, a car follows her and she realizes someone is trying to kill her! Someone is definitely stalking her but why, and who?"
5,A Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great book full of alot of excitement and many details that makes you want to never ever put the book down.It's about a girl named Cary whose father is running for governor of Texas.She knows her life will change, but she never thought it would this much.She gets mysterious phone calls and is framed of actions she did not do.She thinks at first that it is just political rivalry but then realizes the cause of some of these horrible things is that she overheard 2 men talking about something they didn't want anyone to know, but she didn't hear everything and they don't know that.Now she tring to find who is threating her, why, and what they are hiding.With some help from some friends, she figures out what the 2 men were up to before she or her friends are harmed.I hoped my review helped and if you buy this book I hope you enjoy it.P.S.-I'm ten and I recommend this book for 10&up; for both gendersPeace!!!!Hollazzzzzzzzzzzzz"
3,Good if grandma's is 100 years old,"This book had great illustrations and looked like a fun book. However, unless your child's grandma was born before peanut butter and TV it may be slightly insulting to grandma."
5,Wonderful and Creative Books,I love these What ?? Can't Do books and so does my 18 month old. He actually brings them to me to read to him.The illustrations are great and the words are so true and endearing. I have almost all the books in the series.
2,Old And Outdated Production,"This is old and not a very professionally produced product ""As The presenter states"" at the beginning. Sorry but for the price, it's definately not worth the money. A big F+!!!"
3,"A companion to ""Twelve Plays for Theatre"" also by Robert Cohen","Please note that translated plays (Sophocles, Moliere, Chekov, etc) may be different from other current translations, but are still good.The plays included are as follows:1. Sophocles, Oedipus Tyrannos2. The Plaie Called Corpus Christi, Part 1: The Beginnings3. William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet4. Molière (Jean-Baptiste Poquelin), The Bourgeois Gentleman5. August Strindberg, Miss Julie6. Anton Chekhov, The Three Sisters7. Samuel Beckett, Happy Days8. Sam Shepard, Fool for Love"
3,Don't get me wrong I actually liked this made for cable t.v. movie...,"Well it was a ghost story done with a few older famous actors like Patty Duke,David Selby from Dark Shadows,and a minor role with David Soul of Starsky,and Hutch,and Salem's Lot...It was a good film in my opinion for a friday night chiller,but really not overly scary...It came very quickly when bought,and a great price...Sincerely Keith Bates"
2,Big disappointment,"I bought this film mainly because David Soul was in it and I liked hiswork in Salem's Lot. As it turns out his role was small and Patty Duke'sperformance left a lot to be desired. The story line struggled to bejust OK. The special effects were laughable, which helped make this worthless film a little entertaining. I am a B horror film nut and find some B horrormovies that aren't scary are at least funny. This film is neither. It has nore-view value at all and I would avoid this title."
4,Quick,"Game is fast paced and fun. Levels become increasingly more difficult to challenge the player. Bought it for me, now my wife can't stop playing it and she thought that she would hate it."
2,Lame,"This game isn't interactive at all. You're supposed to shoot at deer from a stationary point and pop off a bear or two so you don't ""lose a turn"". That's about it. It's arcade style so levels get progressively more hectic and insane, but it doesn't add excitement to the game."
5,Funniest Ever!,"We have shown this DVD to all of our friends, and EVERYONE laughed themselves silly. Very clean, and very FUNNY!!!"
2,Latex stuffed monster,Bought two. Both did not last long. Either a defective item or it should not be used by a big dog.
2,"Pool cover it is, heater? - not so much","I had high expectations for this pool cover that it would, in fact, use the power of the sun to keep my pool warm. It is a great pool cover, but, in my opinion, a not so good pool warmer. It seemed that the science was good: small, interconnected bubble-wrap-type, clear magnifiers slowly using the power of the sun to harness and transfer heat to the waters below. Unfortunately, the first 6 inches got only a few degrees warmer than the deeper water. I was generous in giving it only 2 stars.On a more positive note, the cover seems to be quite durable, does not tear easily, is flexible and easy to pull across the top of the pool without having to walk around and around the pool fine tuning its coverage."
2,More like a 8' not a 10' in size,I purchased this cover for our 10 foot round pool and it was more like a 8 foot round pool cover. It was not what I actually wanted but kept and gave it away to a friend of mine with a 8 foot pool.
1,Not worth it.,"This is not a good product. It does not stay in place, and it should be able to slip over the edges of the pool to hold it in place. It doesn't. I am extremely disappointed in this product."
2,"Solar, but not a fit!","I ordered this solar pool cover because my kid uses the pool all the time and sometimes complain that it's to cold. I figured a solar cover would keep it warm for them in mid afternoons, well when I got the pool cover I was so excited only to open the very nice zipped re-usable plastic bag it came in. I pulled it out and it was nothing more than a circular large plastic bubble. I wonder how can I use this? How does it stay on the pool? Do it just lay on top? To this day I still haven't figured it out! So, there it sits in my garage, a total waist of money!!!"
1,Way too BIG,"This thing says it is for a 8-Foot or 10-Foot pool. I have the 8-foot quick set poll. It is like table cloth it is so big. There is no drawstring to tighten it like the regular cover. I called and the tech guy told me to ""buy some rope"" and then next person told me to cut it."
5,"wow, really heats it up!","Ok, I was skeptical, but our water out of the tap is SO cold, that I had to try something for our 80"" round wading pool. We fill it and wanted the water to last about 3 days, but until getting this thing it just got colder and colder.But this solar cover did the trick! I have to wrap the extra plastic under (could probably cut it off if I felt like it), but the water actually got a little too warm one day and we had to put more cool water in! Of course, we live in a sunny state, but the outdoor temps linger around 70. So this little pool warmer really turned things around for us! Now to get the hose vacuum thingie and we'll be set. Oh yeah, the cover does help keep bugs out (like mosquitoes laying eggs), but there are holes in the cover where I guess in an area with a lot of bugs they could still get in. We just don't have that many bugs here."
4,Works good! Big difference with it,"We bought this because the pool water was freezing cold every time we went to go into it. We noticed a HUGE difference with this cover. We leave it on 100% of the time except for when we are in it. (obviously) The sun beating down on it warms the water tremendously.The only things we don't like is that when it rains, the rain water can still get in and it chills the water off. Also, the water remains cold when it is a little overcast for a day or 2. other than than, great product!"
2,Didn't even last one summer.,"This ""cover"" is nothing more than a cirle-shaped sheet of bubble wrap. It is easy to put on and take off and does raise the water temperature, but it fell apart before the end of the summer. The bubbles disintingrated leaving small round pieces of blue plastic throughout the pool. Now when I try to pick it up, my fingers poke right through what is left of the cover. I gave it two stars because it did what it was supposed to do in heating the water, but it failed miserably in durability."
2,It's bubblewrap!,"Yep, it covers the pool. Barely. This is really just a big piece of blue bubblewrap, cut in a circle, with a few holes in it. I don't expect it to last more than a season. Looking at the pictures, it seems like maybe it wraps over the edge, but that's just the pool itself (we have an Intex metal frame pool, which doesn't have the big blue lip).We ended up also ordering the regular pool cover, sold by the same seller for a lower price."
3,"Works, but don't expect miracles...","It does warm the top layer of water, about 6"" deep. However, because it sits ontop of the water you still need to cover your pool with an additional cover if you want to keep debris out. We live in a windy area and we get alot of dirt and other yard debris in the air. So this solar cover on its own is not enough. You get what you pay for with this one."
2,Intex Easy Set 10-Foot Round Pool Cover Ripped,Intex Easy Set 10-Foot Round Pool Cover ripped within three weeks of use. It was and an inexpensive purchase and made out of cheap material. I don't recommend it.
4,Yup it works!!,"We were averaging out at 84-86F everyday in the pool. We slapped this baby on top and within 24 hours we had 96F. This does not and will not warm the water (here anyway) from top to bottom. It will only really warm it up right up to about 4 inches off the bottom. this was no probelm because once we got in, started moving the water around, the temperature only dropped about 2 degrees.It is bubble wrap but was well worth the $$$ and defiantly a clever idea!"
3,worth it,the solar blanket was a real surprise at how well it worked. It was also easy to shake clean. It only lasts a single season
2,Floats on water but doesn't block many leaves or bugs getting in pool,"Product does help warm the water through the power of the sun, but doesn't do a great job of blocking out debris, such as bugs, leaves etc. Product would work much better if it wrapped around the rim of the pool, however this so-called cover doesn't cover the edges of the size of the pool it claims to cover. It just floats on the waters surface."
4,Extra heating cover,"I purchased this cover for a 10 ft pool. On a 90 degree day, the water temperature has been well over 100 degrees in the pool. The pool is too hot during the day for my children to use. Unless you are looking for an inexpensive hot-tub, I would get the standard cover instead."
2,Just a Bubble Foil,"It is just a bubble foil, so you can buy cheaper at Lowes or any other DIY store."
5,Synchrodestiny + Knowledge= Vital Energy,"David Simon,what a rare jewel. Having been drawn to your book by synchrodestiny, I am truly appreciative of your understanding of all that incorporates our ""Being"". Now I will be able to take my earth tendencies and balance them effectively following your advice, which will be a pleasure. Reading the vitality questionnaire... my score revealed that my vital energy is great and my enthusiasm for life abundant and that I could give my newly purchased book to someone else and be on my way... but still... what to do about my search for balancing my body? Still at a loss as to the ""how"" of balancing my earth body with my playful spirit, mind and soul, I read on and was very happy to discover my answers. I will use this book as a workbook even though it is a hard cover. Every page answers every question I wish I had known how to ask...and now I do."
4,Third uplifting pop&soul release for the gifted british lady,"All of us fans have loved each of the three Des' Ree offerings for some very specific reasons . In Supernatural , the warmth in her voice is once again perfecly combined with her delicant melodies and her , full of wit and simplicity lyrics . "" What's Your Sighn ? "" , "" Indigo Daises "" and the first single "" Life "" are all great yet do pay special attention to the sensational "" I'm Kissing You "" and the tender , ethereal "" Darwin Star "" , the magic ballad which the Celine Dions of this world have never released . Even though she's a beautifull tall woman , Des' Ree sounds she would be perfect as your best friend as well ."
3,"Great, if you don't already have the first three seasons.","I ordered this because it was called ""best of"" and I thought they must have at least one episode from each season. Well, the only episodes are from seasons 1-3 and all but two are episodes I would not consider the best. If you are a fan and do not already own the first three seasons, by all means buy this dvd. If you are hoping for later episodes, save your money."
4,I only watch for Brittney Powell,"I love her in her episodes as Randi JoOne of her first appearances and she looks as beautiful as she does now.Randi Jo- They Shoot Videos, Don't They? (1992) ... Randi Jo- Double Date (1992) ... Randi Jo- The First Gig (1992) ... Randi Jo"
4,paradise,"I enjoyed this book, although by far my favorites are Little Me and the Auntie Mame books. This wasn't quite as light-hearted as his other books."
4,Nice size,The Armadillo is soft and has lots of detail on it. It's kind of neat for a stuffed animal. My son loves it!
4,Soft toys,"The toys are excellent and arrived very quickly, even though they had to cross the Atlantic. The mail charges were pretty steep, however."
1,frustrated shopper,"Dear Amazon.com,If you don't have an item in stock, take it off your website! You show that you have four left, but when you go to purchase, the website says you don't have the quantity. Very frustrating. Get your act together, please and update you website."
5,Excellent Choice!!!,"I purchased my bottle of Daily Extra from another seller but I would like to leave a review for the brand itself. I normally take a centrum every day but wanted something with more B vitamins and more to offer in general. I tried One A Day Mens Health and they gave me a horrible stomach ache. I heard about the Daily Extra on a radio show and decided to try them. I have been taking them for 3 weeks now and they make me feel great. The great thing about this vitamin is that they are formulated with NATURAL VITAMINS not some chemicals like other brands. If you want a good, healthy smart choice that is easy on your stomach(I have IBS too btw) then give these a try."
3,"Okay, but not great","Pretty good entry in the WarbirdTech series. Good overall history of the A-26 but, as is the nature of the A-26, can get a little confusing at times. Tedious in parts, especially when speaking about the civilian upgrades, but that's made up for with the pictures. Some great pictures of WW II/Korea nose art."
4,former b-26 pilot,I did a combat tour in Korea in 1952 in the Invader. Material on the operation is scant. This book fills in many aspects of the night interdiction mission of the B-26. Excellent photos and references.Donald Krueger
1,Very Disappointing,"When I got this book, I started looking through it, and I am very disappointed with it. You would think that something that says it is a 'Tech' series book would have some performance data. It does not. The closest it gets to 'Tech' is several 3 view drawings with dimensions on it.Overall, I rate this as a do not buy. Very disappointing."
3,"Read it when it was new, then bought a copy and re-read","I thought it was pretty darned good when I was 13 or so. On re-reading it, I found it to be pretty dated. There is a certain amount of material that was probably funny because it was 'naughty' but what was naughty in the early 60s had lost its edge. I don't say the book wasn't funny in its time, but time has passed. ONE BIG BUT...The real reason I bought it was for a short story by John Ciardi, ""Cadillac Full of Diamonds."" Even as a teenager I was struck by the allegory, and I didn't even know what ""allegory"" meant at the time. I have read several of his other books, and enjoyed them too, but once again, I was in my teens and it was back in the 60s. It's hard to say how they would affect me now, but two I wouldn't mind giving a try again would be ""Don't Get Perconal with a Chicken"" and the Practical Joker book.I wonder if Dave Barry will seem 'quaint' in 50 years?"
3,double check the measurements before buying,I made a mistake of only checking my waist and inseam measurements.Turns out I should have also checked my thigh measurements.This was way to loose in that region for my person liking.
2,No where near!,"If I hadn't read the book this might have been an ok movie. However, the movie is NOTHING like the book! I use it to show my students what they are missing out so many times when they watch a movie instead of reading the book...We Venn Diagram the movie and the book. It makes a good compare and contrast."
2,the Waste-ing game,"I had my English class read the book, they loved it and of course asked if a movie was ever made. I told them about the terrible reviews that it got, but they said they'd write a comparison if I let them watch it. Deal! Anything to get them to write more. 90% of them liked the book more and most thought the movie was terrible and changed far too many details."
2,Completely Unlike the Book,"If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of the book, look elsewhere. This movie bulldozed over key characters and plot points. So disappointing."
4,The Westing Game video,"The video was a follow-up to reading the book of the same title. The video, though different from the book, is fun. It arrived in a timely manner and was in reasonably good condition, though used. It was not in quite as good a condition as I believed the seller was claiming, but maybe I was just too optimistic."
3,The Westing Game,The book was much more interesting than the movie. I used the movie after my students had read the book and we made a comparison.
5,A+ for quality,freud router bits are the best and this one is no exception. i only use freud and they leave a smooth finish behind and stay sharp a long time. cant go wrong with this bit.
2,router bit,Works as it should . But I could have got it cheaper and carbine tiped from other places. Thought I would give Freud a try . Oh well make one mistake your falt repeat that mistake then it becomes my falt . They are good bits so are many cheaper sources .
5,Perfect Martini,These earrings are much nicer than I expected. Very high quality & absolutely adorable.
5,Love Them!!!,These youth voices are truly angelic and so harmonious. I have two of their CDs and they really warm your heart when they sing. The music is very eclectic so never becomes monotonous.
3,Good begining,Good beginning point for review of family history. One must go to Barbados to get the unvarnished truth and details.
4,My Introduction to Slayer,"This was the first Slayer album I ever heard, back in Christmas of 1994. At first I didn't care for it but after subsequent hearings I feel in love with the groups' music. While this of course remains a personal favorite of mine due to the nostalgia factor, it is in fact an excellent album and recommended for any newcomer to Slayer. The performances and sound quality are excellent. The only complaint I have is that at times the left guitar is completely overpowered by the guitar in the right channel. This happens on a few songs on disc one. The track selection is good but I feel there could have been a few less tracks from ""Seasons in the Abyss"" and more from ""Hell Awaits"" and ""South of Heaven"". Overall though an excellent and highly recommended live album."
4,"CD Slayer, Decade of Agression","Slayer's music is unique. It's sad. No group plays music with such deep meaningful lyrics with music full of talent. I think the selection of livier songs on DECADE is weak. Only two songs from SEASONS is not on the discs. I think extra selections from SHOW NO, SOUTH OF,or REIGN should have been chosen instead. WAR EMSEMBLE, SOUTH OF HEAVEN, JESUS SAVES, EXPENDABLE YOUTH, are not wise choices. EPIDEMIC, AGGRESSIVVE PERFECTOR, TORMENTOR, CRIONIES, CROOKED CROSS, or SPILL THE BLOOD, are only some of our favorites not on the discs."
5,One of the best live recordings ever.,"Slayer is a great,veteran band. They are also one of the best bands live. This is the best live disc released in the 90's,that's for sure! Excellent all around.The production and the way it was mixed is superb. Starting off with ""Hell Awaits"" ripping right into ""The Antichrist"" leaves chills up and down your spine,it's so awsome. ""Raining Blood"" is incredible. ""Chemical Warfare"" is my fave on this,straight in your face thrash metal LIVE! This whole 2 disc set is great,the songs I listed are just MY standout picks. They don't make live albums like this anymore. Decade of Aggression is a masterpiece in live recording."
3,"Good, but not great","First off, I am a huge Slayer fan and Dave Lombardo is one of my drumming heroes.This album is great, but not very tight. Two songs are actually pretty horrific to listen to: War Ensemble and Angel of Death on disc 1. On WE, Lombardo is a little off with his ride cymbal until he hits the section with the fast double bass - then he is way off. In AoD, the section from the dueling solos to the end of the song sounds kind of like a trainwreck. However, these tunes were recorded near the end of Lombardo's first run with Slayer and at that time he and the rest of the band weren't getting along very well and his drum tech was not setting up his drums properly. (That's also why the double bass break in AoD sounds uneven.) As bad as Lombardo played on those two tunes, they are actually neat little pieces of Slayer's history.With that said, the rest of the album rocks. It's nothing they haven't done live before but what more can you want in a Slayer show!\m/ Slayer! \m/"
4,Worth getting.,The Requiem is a truly unusual and quite magnificent piece. I am surprised it is not performed more often. The other pieces are well worth hearing as well.
4,Gets the job done,"Actually got this product to keep the cat from unrolling the toilet paper. Definitely gets the job done! Kind of a pain to have to use both hands to get my toilet paper now (the springs are so strong, you have to hold it open with one hand so you can get the toilet paper with the other), but it definitely gets the job done! No more unrolled toilet paper in our house."
3,Was pleased at first... Not anymore.,So I bought this to protect my TP from my cat because she would unroll the roll any chance she got. This product helped on that but it became a gateway for her to scratch the TP off since she could not unroll it... An even worse habit. DO NOT USE FOR CAT!
3,Great for preventing tee pee-ing :-),"I got this to prevent against my puppies tee pee-ing our bathroom. We have an accordian door on the master bathroom and the pups learned quickly how they could open it themselves. So they would let themselves in, then pull every bit of tp off of the roll and scatter it all over the bathroom and house. The first time it was cute, so I took a picture, but not so cute as it continued. So hence the roll stopper. We put this bad boy on and it immediately stopped the problem. It does make it a tad difficult to get the TP off to use if your dispenser is in a strange location (ours is on the same wall as the back of the toilet, so you have to turn around as it is to get it). But if our dispenser wasn't in a goofy place, I don't think it would be a problem. Anyways, does what it says and stopped my puppies' plans to tee pee the house. Once they were older and grew out of that stage, we were able to take it off without problem. :-)"
1,bad invention,"The roll guard will not allow tissue to come off the roll. It keeps kids from pulling down the paper, but also keeps adults from using it."
4,Annoying but effective.,"Our cats have finally started to unroll the toilet paper, and from example also taught my daughter to do so. The contraption is a bit annoying when you have to use it because it requires 2 hands. However I would recommend this product because it works as it's supposed to.UPDDATE: After about 2 weeks of having this to prevent my daughter from unrolling the toilet paper, she mastered how it worked. Bummer"
3,Served its purpose...,"I originally bought this Toilet Roll Guard because I was sick of my cat un-rolling entire rolls of toilet paper to play with! It definitely served its purpose because my cat stopped playing with the toilet paper and even months after removing the guard he has still never tried to un-spool the paper again! However, this product is a pain in the butt for the humans using it. You have to use two hands to get the paper out, one to tug paper and one to hold down the lever. Sometimes it gets caught and you have to struggle with the contraption to get any paper out at all! And changing an empty roll is even more of a headache. It is difficult trying to take it off, once you get your new roll on it is a pain getting it back on! I gave up after a few weeks of my boyfriend complaining constantly about it, and fortunately by this time my cat stopped bothering with it too! So like I said, it served its purpose.. now it has been donated to the Good Will!"
2,best for Parrafin wax users,"The book contains lots of tips, instructions and trouble shooting for parrafin wax candles. However, I use soy and palm wax so much of the information was not relevant to me."
4,No-frills instruction on candlemaking,"I originally borrowed this book from the library and held it so long I owed money on it! When I started making candles, I didn't know a thing. With this book, I am able to determine how to solve my problems and when to just take my time--you can't rush a candle into cooling. Being an expert takes time, but I find that candles make easy and nice gifts, but may also come in handy for Y2K! You never know."
2,The Candlemaker's Companion,"This book was too outdated. It did not include anything about soy wax candles, which is the most popular these days. It also did not include anything about the new wooden wicks that are being used now. (The type where you can actually hear crackling when the candle burns.) Very disappointed as these were the items I was interested in."
3,poor illustrations,As i read in another review -- pictures would be nice instad of drawings. Good info in this book though. i guess no color pictures keeps a book cheaper.
3,can do without,definitly a book i can do without. i bought it cheap and its paperless so i cant complain too much.
4,Great comprehensive book,What a great comprehensive candle making book! I can definitely seeing revisiting this as I try different techniques. The only downside is its older and doesn't cover soy candles. But definitely worth having in your library.
4,Alphabet Art : With A-Z Animal Art & Fingerplays,"I have successfully used this book with older three's and four's in my pre-k classes over the years. With younger children, the projects are too complicated and I found they just don't work well. However, with the older pre school set, this book can be a fantastic resource. I used the projects and fingerplays in conjunction with ""Letter of the Week"" activities and it worked well. The children learned and retained the letters and the fingerplays and really enjoyed them. I was concerned that the ""process"" of experiencing and creating not become lost in making something vaguely ""recognizable"" for the enjoyment of their parents, etc. I make an example and they can do their own interpretation and that way children are respected and I also get some extremely charming projects to show off on the bulletin board. Win-Win situation. :))"
4,cheap but they work,"These adapters are a lot cheaper than those which you find elsewhere. The quality isn't quite the same: these cheaper ones exhibit more play between the locking ring and the T body. However, they work just fine and the resistance of the connectors is low (I only tested two or three of them with the Fluke). One star off for being flimsy; then again, what did I expect?"
1,Don't bother with this bit,I was very disappointed with this product. On the first board I cut (a soft piece of pine no less) the bit chipped! I don't know if I happened to get a defective bit or if Freud is just a low quality product. I would look to a different brand if I were you.
2,"Best arguments from the book refuted in Mind 114 (2005), pp 145-149","From reading Hume's Abject Failure by Ehrman to A Defense of Hume on Miracles by Fogelin, one may wonder where Hume's argument against Miracles stands in our contemporary times in analytic philosophy.Professor of Philosophy, Timothy McGrew answered that question in the philosophy Journal, Mind 114 (2005), pp. 145-49.Essentially, Fogelin's defense fails. But don't take my word for it, read the abstract I cited from one of the most well respected academic philosophy Journals that has stood the test of time. I can't bring justice to Timothy McGrews argument but to point you to it and say, the buck doesn't stop here. If you're really interested in where Hume stands, this is not the last book to read."
4,The Politics of Leadership: Superintendents in Changing Times,"This volume is an excellent source of case studies and discussions of the highly charged symbiotic relationship of district superintendents and boards of education. The editors have done a good job at gathering together a group of scholars that present different views of this dynamic relationship and in the end this text contributes greatly to the conversation and understanding of how this relationship ebbs and flows to influence policy, decision-making and the education of children. I would highly recommend it as a resource for anyone interested in becoming a superintendent, those that teach future district administrators or those who are interested in studying district leaders."
2,Great while it lasted,"I bought this to use with a Bostitch palm nailer so that I wouldn't have to fight with the air hose while installing A35 clips in limited access joist bays. It worked great for about 40 A35s (12 nails in each), but then started leaking large amounts of air, rendering it unusable. Too bad, it makes using a palm nailer that much easier. It is only a couple of months old, I'll see if I can't get some warranty service from Amazon or Stanley."
2,"Item dented, and different from picture.","Connector was received with several dents and dings in it. Also, it is different from the picture shown; mine didn't have the beveled corners."
2,Don't waste your money,"This DVD looks like it was made about 20 years ago - shot with video and real cheesy annoying production. I would overlook these short comings if the information was in anyway insightful but there is not much here beyond basic common sense.here I'll sum it up for you1 poke wood and siding with a awl or screwdriver to make sure its not rotten2 shake counters and hand rails - jump on floor and stairs to see if solid3 look for stains, mold, or cracks on ceilings and walls4 turn appliances on & offseriously I would only suggest this product if it were a free library rental"
1,Onanistic hubris,"Quite simply the most misguided, irritating, self-indulgent...let's just say the worst text ever written on Bataille (although I certainly do not limit its putrescence to Bataille literature alone). On every page this author is practically screaming, ""Look at me! I can be like him! I'm the Ass who saw the Angel (yes, he wishes he were Nick Cave too, I imagine) I can write like him!"". Seriously... perhaps the lowest point...an anecdote...a guy walks into a bar and explains to the bartender that he just cut the throat of God. It doesn't, nay can't get any worse than this."
1,mish mash of ideas,"This book was one of the most confusing disjointed messes I have ever read. There are at least 3 seperate timelines going on simultaneously, which are supposedly interconnected but the links are tenuous at best. And the ending defies rational belief. It's as if the authors reached a point and said ""ok, lets write one more chapter to wrap this up, it's long enough to print now."" If this is the best either of the authors can do, I cannot recommend anything else they write, unless it shows significant improvement."
1,Big dissapointment after the first book,The book is confusing and hard to follow. The ending is unvelievable -- evan for SF.
5,Ehwa's Book of Pipes,"An excellent book for overall basic knowledge of pipes and pipe tobacco. It was written in the 70's, so a few items, such as references to major pipe manufacturers, and typical pipe prices, are a bit outdated; however information still very informative. A plethora of colored graphics, enhances the overall value and enjoyment of this book, such that it could easily serve as a coffee table reference. If I were to have just one pipe book, I would seriously consider this one."
3,will not play in my car!,"I love the songs, but the CD will not play in my vehicle's CD player; only on my computer and my ipod."
5,Supa Sweet,"Words cannot describe the almost effervescent quality of this music. Upon submerging yourselves in William Ether's musical world/soundscape, you can truly become lost. He has succesfully mixed many genres of music together, including ethereal, folk, prog and psychadelic. I congradulate Mr. Ether and his band on this amazing accomplishment of musical genius."
3,"Portuguese Renaissance - contemplative, not much variety","Frei Manuel Cardoso and Duarte Lobo are the two most important composers of Portugal in the age of the Renaissance. They are exact contemporaries, Cardoso 1566-1650 and Lobo 1565-1646. Not that I hear any significant stylistic difference. All the works sung by The Sixteen are a capella. The music is mostly ecstatic, meditative, contemplative, in the manner of Palestrina. The first eight tracks are Cardoso, the rest Lobo. The disc's 63 minutes is pleasant but doesn't offer much variety, much beef either (no resounding Gloria here), nor as much harmonic surprises as in the music of the English Renaissance.Informative liner notes. The disc was recorded in 1993 by the now demised Collins Classics, but it has been reissued on The Sixteen's own label, Coro:Renaissance Portugal: Sacred Music of Cardoso and Lobo."
4,"Overall, good repair manual","The manual contains concise, step-by-step instructions on how to perform scheduled maintanance as well as indepth information on everything from engine teardown to clutch replacement. The primary thing lacking is better subject, chapter indexing. It would be great if the repair items referenced in the maintanance schedule had a page or chapter reference to go directly to. This would save alot of time."
3,Worth the money...barely,"This review is going to come out as more negative than maybe it should, but in light of the fact that all the other reviews posted here seem very favorable, I just gotta provide some balance: this book left me disappointed.I was looking for much (!) more detail on how Fuqua actually conducted his business deals. He seems to gloss over so much --- ""I bought company X for 10 million, and sold it 3 years later for 30 million"" --- why? How? Give me the freakin' gory details so I can do it too.Big, big business deals get described in a few sentences, when they should really be given much more space for detail.I bought this book because I am a businessperson, and I wanted to learn something from one of the most successful business dudes out there. I felt like he told me 5% of what he could have."
4,Excellent biography of this man.,"Yes, this is definitely a well written and informative biography of Mr. Fuqua. It is unfortunate though, that it has the word ""how"" in the title, as it does not tell you ""how"" he made his fortune, rather it tells you how HE made HIS fortune, (and that was by using other people's money). It is nevertheless a very good book, that has many smart ideas, as well as moves that he made in his life, which could be imitated, or expanded upon, by others, to fit their situation, and thereby they could possibly make their own fortune. (Case in point: living out in the sticks, nowhere near any library, he figured out a way to get knowledge about subjects otherwise closed to him -by borrowing books through the mail- and this was at a time when phones were almost a luxury!). It may not tell you just how to make a fortune, but it will probably give you a few ideas, or, pointers, to help you in that quest."
3,Left me only half way there.,"J. B. Fuqua is a very inspirational businessman. I enjoyed this book, but he gives very little detail. He mentions these big business deals but thats just it. He ONLY MENTIONS them!!! No doubt in my mind there could be a great book written about Mr. Fuqua, but in my opinion this is not it!"
5,SOOOOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!,"I have her and she is my absolute favorite Breyer horse I have and always willbe probably! She has a gorgeous fleabitten gray coat, and these innocent-looking eyes. Her tail and mane are long, and her tail adds added standing support because of it's Arabian-style length.And her name: Sahara. How much more beautiful and luscious can you get?She is absolutely gorgeous, and I recommend her to anyoe who is horse-crazy like me!-A very happy Sahara owner"
4,beautiful!,"This is a very pretty model.I love the color of her coat, and the possition she's in.It's deffinitly worth the money."
2,Ok...this was someone with a personal camera,"This has to be one of the biggest wastes of money that I have ever gotten involved with. This movie had to be the work of someone recording with their own camera at a couple of street parties and there was not much to see. I was hoping to see a bunch of half dressed, gorgeous women dancing in ways that are barely legal in most foreign countries. This....this I could have recorded in a low budget grocery store with a decent stereo. Don't waste your money as I did."
2,"Mediocre, But Not Because of Peg","The social anthropology of large organizations. A fascinating idea in principle.Peg says in this book that you can leverage this as influence to improve the organization's culture.The shame about it is that many organizations since 1993 have created apocrypha around negative, not positive, events. What captures our collective imagination is Enron, Tyco and Adelphia, not so much the companies that create and share vitality and success.So, if only we did legendary stuff..."
3,A Question,The previous reviewer is either....(a) Talking meaningless gibberishor...(b) Having a joke.Does anyone else have a view on which ?
5,This CD is the Black Crowes' essential contribution to rock!,"I am baffled at how overlooked this CD is. I think it needs to be taken as a whole--in the same way that one would listen to other great rock albums, like ""Exile On Main Street"", ""Captain Fantastic"", or ""Physical Graffiti"", the Black Crowes' ""Amorica"" is a cool rock'n'roll journey to a mythical place inside your mind. Has that 70s vibe, but really seems timeless, sounds fresh every time. This album represents the Black Crowes at their creative peak. Truly stunning."
3,"The Crowes step into experimentalism, with mixed results.","Somewhat of a disappointment after ""Southern Harmony"", still it is worth a listen, although I feel only the diehard Crowes fan will make it a permanent part of their frequent-listening collection."
2,"Just OK, not inspired","I had read that this was the one of their best yet. I say NOT. I find it rather boring. It is all journeyman work, but not inspired."
3,i dont get it,"im a very big crowes fan, but i dont understand why everyone likes this album. i liked all their other albums, so when i read the great reviews, i was very excited. but i find the album to be very poor. i would recommend shake your money maker instaead, a great album, in my opinion their best."
2,"The album cover is bad enough, but have you listened to this album?","I really liked the first 2 Black Crowes albums. Yes they are blues-based, but that's because they're from Georgia. However, they still rocked with Stones and Faces influences. I mean after being used to hearing songs like ""Twice As Hard"" ""Jealous Again"", ""Remedy"", and my personal favorite ""Sometimes Salvation"" I was appalled at what I heard here. For starters this doesn't rock at all with the exception of ""A Conspiracy"", and the music is just blah. I am really disappointed with the Crowes for this one. I just have to ask why they released this album? I mean the cover was bad enough making the American Flag into a g-string, or thong is disrespectful. I happen to love this country despite it's issues right now, and feel that this ranks up with burning the flag. I also feel that they abandoned their roots with this album. Why oh why oh why?"
4,An Overlooked Classic,"Yep, I admit it. I didn't like this album for the longest time, but I kept hearing Wiser Time on the radio and fell in love with the song and then the album. With today's jamband culture getting a hold of the mainstream, this album would be received as an instant classic. What a difference 10 years makes. Unlike many Crowes albums, Chris Robinson isn't over-selling the lyrics, the music is smooth and free and the whole band seems like they all contributed. Do yourself an favor, buy this album and a couple of Gov't Mule CDs and enjoy!"
5,THE BEST Black Crowes Album,"This is their magnum opus (so far). Should have been a double album--there were enough b-sides and outtakes, just about all of which were excellent tunes in their own right. Takes a couple of listens to get into, but this album will grow on you. It's spiritual and classic, and shows an artistic integrity that's hard to come by in the hard rock genre. Musicianship and the vibe of the recording are hot!! Enough of my babbling--this is a desert island disc--get it!"
4,A good resource for CSA prep,"Although it doesn't have the real CSA format, it is worth studying. It can help you get insight about the CSA. It also has a lot of high-yield complaints that can appear on the real CSA. You can practice thorough history taking and physical exam with the checklist. A must for CSA/CSE candidates!"
5,"A Wonderful, Clearcut Study.","I wasn't sure what I expected when I read Richard Gambino's book. The only thing I can say is that it was a real eye-opener! As a second generation Italian, this book brought home all the thoughts and feelings I had over a lifetime, and gave them a clarity never before experienced. Suddenly things that my immigrant father had told me had meaning...the hows and whys were suddenly answered. La Via Vechia (The Old Ways) were always important, and stressed in my home, and now are being handed down to my own children. The book is clearly written, and a very entertaining and engrossing read. Bravo, Signore Gambino, Bravo!"
3,Good.....but frustrating when trying to put on,"The problem with this product -- and I don't know if this is just with the large size versus a smaller size -- is that it is very difficult to put on your finger. You would expect the product to easily roll down your finger. However, more often than not, it gets caught up with the rubber above the roll and does not roll on easily.I have used another version in the past that did not do this.....but do not remember the name of it other than to say it was blue in color.Other than that, it works fine."
2,A strange book,"I bought this book without any description of it, wanting a book about Marigolds. What I got is a book about Marigolds, but it's so strange and uninformative that I couldn't possibly recommend it to anyone. Unless, of course, you are headed to a mental hospital. It's definitely NOT what I was looking for."
5,Echobelly's LUSTRA is Brooding British Brilliance!!!,"I've been a follower of Echobelly ever since their first album EVERYONE'S GOT ONE (aka EGO) hit the shelves in 1994. It had an indescribable catchy verve to it. Quite interesting. Then in 1995, ON was released and they topped themselves with an even more self-assured and excellent album. It wasn't for about three years that they finally gave us LUSTRA.This album, I feel, is the group's crowning achievement. One has often heard that the third time is the charm; LUSTRA is no different in this respect. Though the music and lyrics are darker and more dense, the original Echobelly personality shines out in every track. On this American release, you get five additional tracks that were once the elusive B-sides on the single releases. With seventeen tracks of musical bliss, one cannot help but succumb to the spell that is spun by Echobelly. I can only hope they continue to produce such high quality music for years to come. Check it out for yourself."
3,OUT OF A LIFE PUT ON HOLD,"This album is a good effort, but it does not measure up to On. Here you will find tantalising sound, luscious vocals and a few examples of clever lyricism, but overall On would be the better purchase if you are making a choice between the two. Highlights here include ""Bulldog Baby"", ""Out of the breakdown of the whole, back to the choices on repeat, out of a life put on hold""; ""Welcome to the new dictators. Power drugs and imitators"". ""I'm Not A Saint"" is a great rallying point... and in ""Everyone Knows Better"" ""Sunshine-a ray of hope in a hopeless situation. Suntanned-your reward for the hopeful hours that you spend-burning."""
3,Mediocre Effort,"The film footage here is great, but this is just a series of vignettes. There is very little history here, they skimmed over Guadalcanal with almost no mention of the naval battles. The DVD was cheap, so I guess I got what I paid for."
2,Powerful narration and film but...,"I have at least three reservations with this title, at first I was very anxious in waiting for it to arrive on my hands but as I was beginning to watch the documentary I was disappointed by some sections specially the Europian campaign section on the Global presentation. Although there was much material on this section I was not impressed because we all knew then that D-Day or ""fortress euoropa"" was fought on a vast region and there were lots of battles here. Maybe the majority of film on this part was on black and white. 2nd reason I was dissapointed was how each footage was presented, I hated the way they introduced each topic using that awful blue background. Lastly I was dissapointed because I wanted to see more but this title didn't satisfy my cravings. Hmmmm, maybe it was my fault, I expected too much. So guys if you are going to choose your first documentary on WWII don't depend on color there are lots of materials on ""black and white""."
3,works pretty good,"works better then most as far as distance but has several false alarms, the distance meter is sketchy at best and the monitor (that goes on your child) has a clip that can only be usedwith the provided strap which is very small (my daughter is 4yrs old and tiny and it's barely big enough to fit around her waste."
2,Adequate Material - Biased Exam,"I read this book cover to cover twice and answered the majority of the review questions to prepare for the exam. I felt very comfortable with the material and didn't think I'd have a problem on the exam. However, when I took the test, the majority of the material covered in the book was not asked about on the test. I think you have to buy the IIA's review materials (which are much more expensive than Wiley) in order to pass this test."
3,"Film fans, seek it out","THE 50 WORST FILMS OF ALL TIME will give movie buffs a good laugh. It was worth reading just for the review of ""Trouble Man."" Seek it out and keep it on your coffee table."
3,Add a star if you don't have Defenders of the Faith...,"...because this isn't much more than a toned-down rehash. Virtually all the useful prestige classes from Defenders of the Faith were severely weakened for this book (they needed tweaking, but nothing so drastic) and there's very little new material of note. There is a good amount of information on the deities of Oerth, for players and DMs new to Greyhawk, but virtually all of it can be found elsewhere.What really hurts the book is the terrible editing. There are numberous typos, references to ""page XX"" without the ""XX"" filled in, and, most glaringly, a lack of any sort of index! Complete Warrior was good, even if you had the earlier books, but this book I can only recommend to players who really want to have divine prestige classes in their campaign but lack access to Defenders of the Faith or Dragon magazine."
4,A mixture of old and new,"While this book contains some old stuff from D&D 3.0 (updated to 3.5), it also contains a lot of new material. The writers collected a lot of info on the divine spellcasters from various older books and magazines (a good thing, as you do not have to carry tons of books and magazines), and also added new ideas and value to the game. Some ideas in the book (like most PrCs) are ""only for role players"", and power gamers will find several things not really useful. Also, the chapter on the divine world and the role of religion in the D&D world is mainly useful for beginners (but experienced gamers may also find some ideas useful)."
3,My opinion,"I didn't buy the soft cover books, So this is creat for me. My cleric advanced enough(10th) that I thought I should improve its spell capability. The only thing that bugs me is that it asumes you are in greyhawk for all the Gods referenced. Maybe I'm odd but if you are publishing books that are not realm specific you shouldn't be so ""god"" specific.If you intend on continuing in the 3.5 world and you play a cleric I'd buy it."
2,Disappointed,"This is by far the worse book of the Complete serie. 3 new close to useless classes. They do have some flavour but nothing that would make me play those class over in other found in any books.I liked some of the prestige class, Black Flame Zealot is by far the best IMO, and Rainbow Servant comes next ( coualt lovers PRC)Feats are okMagic items : ok i guessDEITIES: they used greyhawks deities while everyone knows they are mainly focusing on their new and sweet baby : Eberon. so a full chapter is useless unless you play in greyhawk...I was expecting maybe too much of this book... but the other 3 didn't make me regret buying it... I know i wont use it half as much im gonna use the other books"
2,"Might be good, but all the $$$ necessary for D&D is lame","Here's why D&D; supplements (ie SPLAT books) are good:If you want a lot of extra rules, occasionally some good new optiosn, and the ability for your players to make characters that are overpowered -- without a single magic item. And when the overpowered characters DO get an item, look out!Here's why they suck:I'm happy they pumped the Clerics, Paladins, etc ... but if you buy the D&D; game, you're looking at hundreds of dollars of books.The whole system needs to be revamped. A roleplaying game shouldn't cost players, GM's, or fans hundreds of dollars.Players & GM's, go find a cheaper yet also good RPG like Call of Cthulhu, Amber Diceless, Paranoia, Hackmaster, ShadowRun, etc. Or just DON'T buy all the expansions!!!"
1,Complete Divine Needs Divine Intervention,"Has the previous reviewer even read this piece of junk? Rehashed classes, miserable editing and major rules problems. Save your money and send a message to WOTC. Shoddy workmanship should not be rewarded. I only hope Eberron is better."
4,Good ATX case for budget price,"This case was purchased for a low budget upgrade and worked very nicely. The fit, finish, and arrangement of the internal areas and the exterior was much better than any of the budget cases I have purchased locally. I will choose this case again if these are still available for another upgrade."
2,Save your money,"The cars are good and perform well, but the tracks are cheap! The track-wire contacts raise out of their groves and are impossible to get back in, the wire-contacts and grove-connectors don't fit well from one track to the other, the locking mechanism that connects the tracks are practically impossible to unlatch - you'll either damage a finger, or simply end up pulling the track apart - thereby breaking the track. These short comings make it impossible to use any of the ""raised"" track layouts; you can only use 3 flat surface layouts (which can be challenging); but it's too much of a bother connecting the tracks properly to keep the electrical current flowing."
1,Didn't work,One track didn't work and also disappointing that it only runs on batteries - can't plug in.
5,Great Bag!,Great Bag for youth roller blades. Inside pockets are great. Everything fits nicely. We got the Pink Leopard / Balck color. My daughter is very happy and organized.
5,Great Skates Bag! Has held up well!,"This was a gift for my niece who is 6 and is taking ice skating lessons. It's an excellent backpack; roomy and well made. She loved the color and pattern (purple, stars). Great bag!Update May 23, 2012,19 months later, this bag is used 2-3 times per week...holds ice skates and other items and has held up extremely well. No problems whatsoever."
3,Nice bag but Size 10 Rollerblades do not fit,Nice design but I was disappointed that my Size 10 Rollerblade Outback X skates would not fit. You'll need a bigger bag or smaller feet 8-)
3,Can inline skates fit,I see the great reviews on this bag....I am wondering if my Alexis 84 inline skates will fit??? I am also interested in the saddlebag for transporting skates. If anyone has suggestions please advise...thanks
5,Wonderful!,"I love this bag. It has room for everything I need at my practice and lessons, and the ventilation lets the skates dry quickly. It's easy to carry, too. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has their own skates."
2,Function - good/Quality Poor,"Two of the skaters in our club have had these, including my daughter, and the straps simply don't hold up to normal use - the material and the way they are sewn in is flimsy. Neither one lasted more than about 3 months.Functionally they are great - we went from two bags to one.I'm considering getting someone with a heavy duty sewing machine to put new, better quality straps on them - possibly from an old good quality daypack."
4,"Bag is nice, beware of ""dot"" colors","I ordered the bag in ""powder dot"" and from my screen it looked as if it where powder blue with white dots, however when I got the bag it was blue dots on a blue background. I called Amazon and they agreed that it also looks like white dots so they sent me a return label to return it. Beyond the color inaccuracy, the ""dots"" kind of look like stickers on the fabric and kind of look cheap like they might start to peel off over time. I wonder if all of ""designs"" are stickers or if any are actually fabric. Once I get my refund, I will certainly order a new one as the functionality seems great, however I don't know if it will be one with a pattern after my ""dot"" situation. To bad it's made in China, but I guess what isn't anymore."
4,Great pack for skates,This bag holds skates and essential items in one place. It is well made. Only 4 stars since zipper is a little small for this application. A more robust zipper would be easier to use.
5,Great bag,"Great bag. Plenty of room for skates, guards, change of clothes, etc. Durable construction. Looks great. My duaughter loves he bag."
5,Awsome!,"My daughter is 15 months old and absolutely without a dought loves! loves! Dora The Explorer!!!!! Since she was about 9months old she has seen almost if every Dora episode. For her 1st Birthday, her theme was Dora. She rec'd this three pack DVD set as a gift and watches it every single day. We just got back from a 2 week road trip, and let me tell you, if it wasn't for Dora, I don't know if this kid would have lasted 13 hours driving in a car( good thing there was a DVD player!) Dora just brightens her day. She laughs with her, applauds when something is done correctly, dances to her songs and even helps catch the stars! My brother in law says that he even walks like Dora! If she ever is in a bad mood or is crying, let me tell you, Dora definately comes to her rescue! This is very fun, cute and educational. She'll probably catch on to Spanish in no time!"
5,Toronto hip-hop in the tradition of No Limit Records,"Ivading the Megacity is a soild compilation that combine a group of MCs. These cats combine bass injected production with taut,tales of the street."
5,iRock 860,I purchased this item for an international trip so that I could download lots of music to enjoy -it was wonderful! I have noticed upon returning home and using the FM tuner that it uses a battery up rather quickly (in less than 2 hours). I am experimenting with using the batteries designed for electronics and hope this eliminates some of this problem. I do enjoy the product.
3,My IROCK,"I don't recommend this product. Adding songs is a very tedious process, it can take up to a minute to add one song. Also, on average it can only store about 50 songs. Two years after purchasing, my mp3 player would randomly start beeping while I was listening to music, forcing me to turn it off. This happened several times and I finally decided to stop using it. Also, it uses A battery that needed to be changed after only about 5 hours of play."
5,Great mp3 player,I bought one of these for myself and loved it so much that I got one for my daughter too. It is great. I can honestly say this is the best I've had. I bought 2 Apple Ipods and 2 Coby brand also and none of those even worked. I really want 2 more of these for other family members. I'm tired of buying crappy mp3 players. I've never had any problem with the irock. I love it.
2,No Bookmarking feature!!,"I just purchased the irock!860 as a replacement for a very old Rio. I was shocked to find that this has no way of bookmarking a track -- it also starts from the beginning of a track after powering off & on. Since I will use this mostly for listening to long lectures, this will be a major problem!"
4,Johnny Cash,"Really enjoy this CD a lot. It's my very first Cash CD, althoughI've always liked his music. It's no wonder he has been so loved for so many years."
5,Thank you Rick Ruben,"I have to say that this is one of the best CDs that I own. Every track is pure perfection from ""The Man Who Couldn't Cry"" to ""Tennessee Stud."" Cash truly shows his sole on this CD."
5,Bad luck winds been blowing at my back,"My bias lies in the love of a singer and a guitar. I love performers doing solo work, and this is about as stripped down as you can get. This was a sort of comeback breakthrough thing for the man in black, and a stunning work it is. I appreciate it all, from the salvation to the murder, as it is a multifaceted view of Cash. I am a bit put of by the live recordings, just because it smacks of hipster audiences. They cheer at yell at the most ridiculous things. This however is not Johnny's fault. He has the greatest ability to turn any piece into something that becomes completely his. Take the GLenn Danzig song Thirteen. This is a true Cash experience, haunting, broody... and then he turns around and does a religious tune, one about vietnam, and closes with the satiric Man who Couldn't cry. This is a beautiful work. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
5,buy this on vinyl,"This superb album, constituting Johnny's amazing career comeback, sounds much better on vinyl than CD. The word that springs to mind is organic. Don't hesitate in buying it. I'm listening to it as I'm typing this out. It's superbly pressed, better than most ""audiophile"" releases. This is the way to listen to CASH.Johnny Cash R.I.P."
5,American Recordings is a Must Have:GREAT New Cash Ballads!!!,"This is absolutely one of the finest cd's that we have ever heard.This is a must have if:1) You Like/Love Johnny Cash2) You Like/Love Ballads3) You Like/Love unplugged accoustic guitar4) You Like/Love Music as ArtWE are seriously considering purchasing a quantity of these cd's and giving one to everyone that we care about . . . it's that good- and not a bad cut of the bunch.Best,Bill & Sharon"
3,"Who's This Johnny Cash Guy, Anyhow","I know he's a legend and all, but do you really think his Tennessee Stud is better than Doc Watson's or his Man Who Couldn't Cry is better than Loudon Wainwright's? When he ties Delia to that chair, I have to suppress a giggle. I'm like, no way this guy owns a sub-mo-chine.That being said, this is a pretty decent record. There's that voice, of course. And there's the backstory. He survived prison and got off the junk and then he married well and had great kids. So the one about the blood running down is pretty chilling. But this one ain't a classic."
5,10 year old son loves his Mondo,"We were looking all over for this toy. Decided to take a chance and order without seeing it (and no reviews). It is a good quality and size. He recd Orange and green. Played with it for quite awhile now and no tips have broken off, so it is durable. Gets dirty, but easy to wash. Not sure about the educational value, but I can see where the texture would be helpful for some kids in therapy. For my son it is just a toy, but he has a surprising amount of fun goofing around with it."
2,Do not buy this camera.,"This camera will cause more headaches than it's worth. Overall the camera's great and that's part of the problem. The picture qualities pretty good (except in dark areas where it's horrible.) The problem is the lack of digital output. If you start learning about video editing and the benefits of the MiniDV format, you'll become excited only to realize that your camcorder doesn't support it. It's the most disheartening thing in the world. What's the point of a digital camera, without the digital output. Did I mention that it's useless in low light situations?"
2,JVC has a lot to answer for here...,"First, the positives. This is a solid, stable machine. The optics are decent; it seems to have the right amount of 'bells and whistles' while not being overly cluttered with features that are beyond the need of the average user. It does, however, have one glaring problem...the camcorder's output is analog, not digital. The only place JVC makes note of this fact is in the front of the instruction manual, where they state that while the camera records digitally, the output of the machine is, in fact, analog. I called JVC and was told that only the DVM5 and similar high-end machines would offer digital output. Even with S-video to my Mac, I'm still editing analog video...and I might as well have stuck with VHS-C!"
4,Great price for a digital camera,I have bee looking for a camera like this at this price for a while now. I must say I have really enjoyed it. It produces sharp pictures with ease. I would recomend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera. A great camera and low price you cannot go wrong.
4,A wondful cameracorder,"I liked the JVC GR-DVF10's automatic lens cover and basic remote control for VCR or remote recording applications. Its 2.5-inch LCD screen swivels 180 degrees, allowing you to record above your head, put yourself in the video, or let our subjects see themselves as you record. The JVC GR-DVF10 provides a 16x optical and 160x digital zoom--great for getting closeups and recording faraway events.I believe you would like it! It is wonderful!"
1,this was a little bit to affordable,it did not have the software i wanted it had good picture it was hard to work with too i recomend not getting this but for amatuers it might be an ok choice after all it is affordable but there are better camcorders so dont get in a rush just because of the price
4,Flash Point,"This was, by far his best novel. The characters were well fleshed out, descriptions of locations were easily visualized and he brought complete closure to all characters and subplots, which he hasn't done before. Lot's of technical jargon, which is lost on this lady, but the guys will love it.Lt. Woods, the lead character was definitely a ""jock"" who thought he was above reproach and he was humbled through the set of events he put in motion. The plot was clearly one that could happen (and in some cases SHOULD happen) and he has set the stage for what the U.S. could most probably expect in the future - his word of caution?I have to chuckle at his blatant dislike for the Air Force - but then, this all came from a Navy man! Good reading - gets off slow, but stay with it and you'll get a fulfilling read. ANN WILLIAMS"
5,Beats Clancy,"The Washington Post said ""If you like Tom Clancy, Huston is good step up"" which I think is right on. Flash Point is all about aircraft carriers and F-14 Tomcats. Unlike Clancy, Huston is a Top Gun graduate and the book reeks with authenticity.But the eerie thing about this book, which was published in 2000, is the depiction of terrorist groups and all the difficulties a conventional military and cold war strategic thinking has in dealing with the new terrorist situation. Huston has obviously done a lot of thinking about this and has some really interesting ideas.Like Clancy's characters, Huston's spend a lot of time worrying about whether they are doing the right thing, but in Huston's case, it is much more realistic and plausible for reasons that I can't disclose here without giving away the plot."
3,Good read by Mr. Huston,"Having read the 2 others by the author, I decided to give this one a whirl. Turned out to be very entertaining. Good work on the carrier stuff with the Navy. Good side stories with the CIA, congressmen, navy chaplain. But the intriguing part was early with the F-14 pilots going ashore, it led to the main story. If you like stuff with fighters and bombers this one is it. The politics surrounding it add a good flavor. The chain of command takes a beating at times but plays a role. Good wins out over evil at all costs."
2,Too many trips to the well,"Huston's first two books were exciting, however, the concept of using the Constitution as a way to justify military action is being over done. The plot line in this third book is so far out that it might be possible. Frankly if I thought that our Navy pilots were as irresponsible & inept as Huston depicts them, I would petition my Senators & Congressmen to have the Commander In Chief recall all our carriers to the US, discharge all the pilots & their direct commanders & start with a fresh batch! The story rambles so that I found myself skimming a lot of the pages. This would probably been a better 'novella' than a novel."
4,Wonderful Cooking Descriptions,I found this book well written. The author writes about his job as a private chef for a rich New York family . . . Personally i think the book ended too soon and would have enjoyed reading more.
4,Good additon to your collection,"This Lionel engine is well made and provides hours of entertainment. I would give a couple of cautions to parents: 1) wait until your child is 8 years old as Lionel recommends. Setting up an electric train set can be very frustrating to younger children. 2) Look at the HO scale first. If your kids played with the wooden or take-a-long Thomas they are use to playing with small toys. The HO scale Thomas train sets are a lot cheaper (an entire HO train set cost half as an O scale engine). If they tire of electric trains quickly, you're not out a lot of money."
5,sleek roulette marker.,"high quality acrylic marker, tinted bottom for the effect, smooth edges and no blemishes/dings. great product, looks good on our home roulette felt."
2,Maggody and the Moonbeams,"Did Joan Hess die and it didn't make the news? This book is just not up to her usual hilarious standards. It's as if some one else was writing this book. The Maggody series is one of my favorites, with zany characters and wit on every page. Her writing has always been so cleverly done, but this one leaves so much to be desired. There is not very much that's funny at the beginning of the book, but once Arly leaves Maggody it's downhill from there. Once the characters reach the church camp, this book resembles a not very well written average murder mystery. The segues back to Maggody from time to time are disjointed and not well developed. I really don't know why Ms. Hess even bothers with these little side trips to Maggody. From now on Joan, keep your stories in Maggody with all the old familiar, absured, crazy folks that inhabit this little town. We love you Joan! Come back!"
3,Not Her Best work,when ever Hanks and Co. leave Maggody (ie Moonbean or Maggody in New York) the stories generally are not as fun to read. This is no exception. Stick with the Maggody based works they are much more enjoyable.
3,More mischief in Maggody,"After Joan Hess's last Maggody book I wondered what else Chief Arly Hanks, Ruby Bee and the Buchanon clans could get into and I will say that I am pleased with the latest effort. Chief Hanks stumbles along the body of a cult member while chaperoning ten of Maggody's future on a retreat. The rest of the book is the usual fare with adventures of the townfolk of Maggody and Arly solving the crime.As always Joan Hess keeps the antics of Kevin Buchanon, Mrs. Jim Bob and Brother Verber (to name a few) laugh out loud but Arly is not the typical heroine who is always kicking butt and able to solve crime.I did find this book a bit lacking with the Maggody parts. There didn't seem to be the same development as if they were rushed. Otherwise an entertaining read."
4,Murder at the Pearly Gates,"Sometimes it is hard to keep a long running series feeling fresh and fun, but Joan Hess manages to bring a bit of revitalization to her Maggody series by sending Police Chief Arley Hanks off with some hormone laden teens, the good Brother and Mrs. Jim Bob to Camp Pearly Gates.While Arley tries to ride herd on the cosmetic mad girls' bodies, Mrs. Jim Bob works on their souls and the good Brother works on a bottle of sacramental wine.Meanwhile back in Maggody, Mr. Jim Bob is enjoying his new found freedom with some friends he has made over the internet.Then one of the girls at Camp Pearly Gates stumbles over a body of a local cult member and things begin to get complicated, as Arley says.A fun romp in the woods with the Maggody crew. Actually I have to note that the description of Camp Pearly Gates raised certain childhood memories of church camp-- laced with the scent of mildewed towels and sweaty sneakers."
4,Getting more high falutin',I have always come to the Maggody stories for light entertainment rather than edification. The jokes were often corny and the characterization crude but the mixture worked. In this one there are a number of highbrow references and Brother Verber reveals a childhood trauma that may account for his character flaws. Even the relatioship between Raz and Marjory is getting more psychologically complex. Where is all this leading? I'll keep reading to find out.
5,For true disciples of Christ,"As Eric Liddell has been my hero since I was a cross country runner in high school, I was glad to finally be able to get my hands on one of his published works. This is a basic guide book for all new disciples of Christ who desire to grow in grace outside of legalism and antinomianism. As my sales coach always preached, ""go back to basics once a year,"" this work has an annual Bible study guide that seasoned saints will prosper from."
2,"Chrome Inside, not blue","Firstly, let me say that I am a *huge* Fisher Space Pen (bullet style) fan. They are great writing instruments.The reason for giving this item a ""2"" is that it is chrome inside (the part that unscrews for cartridge replacement).So it looks great closed, but awful opened with a blue back and chrome front.The whole pen should be blue."
4,Works great. Aesthetically falls short.,"I've carried one of these space pens in my wallet for many years. Compact, almost endless ink supply for its size and it really does write up-side-down. After loosing my last one at a Costco (long, sad story) I ordered a couple of these in the blueberry color. The unpleasing thing about it is that when you open the pen, inside, the part one holds as one is writing is the bare metal - NOT blue. It just looks funny to me. They should have anodized or whatever the inside piece as well. I was surprised and it just comes off looking cheap which didn't match my impression of these pens formed after many many years of total satisfaction with them. That's why 4 stars instead of 5. BTW, someone makes a black colored one that IS colored on that inside part. That's the one I lost at Costco."
3,Thorough job,Bought this for a series of workshops I took on Cognitive Therapy. Pretty good but also fairly dry like most textbooks.
4,"Solid, well rounded album","If it wasn't for Amazon I probably would have never heard of this solid almost perfect alternative country album. If you are a fan of Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, Son Volt, etc then look no further and pick up a copy of this flawless independent release. There is a pervasive meloncholy country vibe throughout however a couple mellow rock tunes thrown in to round out a very solid melodic batch of tunes. Once again I come across a almost unheard of album that is sure to spend alot of time in my CD player. Other required essential alt-country releases include Whiskeytown's ""Strangers Almanac"" and Scud Mountain Boys ""Massachussets""."
3,Not Enough 'Splatter',"Splatter Disco is a decent, but not great indie horror/comedy/musical. It is seriously lacking on the horror side of things, with only a handful of onscreen deaths, most of which don't show much ""splatter"". What makes Splatter Disco worth watching for indie horror fans is the casting. Trent Haaga, Debbie Rochon, Lynn Lowry, and Ken Foree all appear. And Lynn Lowry is especially good, playing a mayor's devious mother. Debbie Rochon even has a brief nude scene. First time in a while that I've seen her ""Rochon's"". Anyway, Splatter Disco isn't for everyone, but it's worth watching if your a fan of any of the aforementioned actors."
3,An enjoyable rarety,"I got this because I enjoy Flotow's best known opera, Martha, but had never heard, or even heard of, any other operas by Flotow. Like Martha, Alessandro Stradella has melodic and enjoyable music. The singing is good however this recording from the 1970s does not have the audio quality of a modern modern recording. Since there are not any modern recordings of this opera, if you like to sample operas that are rarely performed, I would recommend this CD."
4,Vo-Toys Latex Stuffed Gigantic Purple Luny Dog Toy,He is quite a conversation piece. We were hunting for a much smaller toy of the same kind. Never knew it would be so big. To large for our little dog to play catch with but it is loved anyway.
2,disappointed,I have purchased this same toy in the past and it has stood up great to lots of play over many months. The right foot tore off of this one in less than two hours. Not the quality from Vo-Toys I am accustomed to.
3,Great organization of scripture but....,"This book is listed as a ""topical guide for raising children from the book of Poverbs"" and it is just that. I thought this book would provide more information about how each of the proverbs can be utilized to help with crucial issues that arise during parenting. The book simply organizes the proverbs into groupings such as ""self-control"" and ""relationships"". It would have been nice if the author provided more guidance about how the proverbs can be used to address real-life issues that face children and adolescents."
4,Good,Good job getting product to us in a timely manner. I would have given a higher score if I had been informed that the payment had been received by vendor.
5,Nice plug!,It's really big can only take about half of it but useing it for about ten minutes you can actually feel it stretching you larger! I really like it use water based lubricant and lots of it. great toy!
4,Remind Me To Smile,"By the time I bought this album first time round, off the back of Pleasure Principle, the sudden change in Numan's mood and out look on the whole thing hit you right in the face from song one. Everything was becoming a struggle and tracks like Please Push No More and Remind Me To Smile give you an exact in sight on how Gary was by now feeling. Remember I was Vapour is a reminder to everyone that he's only human, just like me and you.Putting Gary inner sadness to one side, this is a mile stone in Garys career that I find myself playing quite regularly..Definate must in anyones collection"
5,Excellent,"My mother bought this album for me from HMV on saturday when it was raining. I opened it up, and played it, as soon as I heard this wreckage, I knew the album would be good. Telekon, is slower than pleasure prinicpal / living ornaments, and is more depressing. But its really good and some songs are really fast.BUT, this album is more important than you think it is. I bought the one with extra tracks (recording remastered), and it had a song called Trois Gymnopedies, that Gary replayed, it was amazing! And a few years later, I played Trois Gymnopedies electronically, and from there on I made the Electronic Classical Cd: Kulture."
4,Paranoid Android,"OK, some of the man-machine themes are taken a bit too far but Gary Numan's skill on synths is unparralleled. Especially fine work on I Dream of Wires and the sentimental Please Push No More.The great addition to this release is the addition of a piano version of Down in the Park."
3,"Interesting In Places, But Forgettable For The Most Part","I have to admit, Gary Numan was doing something quite different than most people when this album came out. His use of synthesizers was interesting. ""We Are Glass"" is the strongest song on here. The rest of the songs are pretty much forgettable. Most of them are to drawn out, and not too interesting to begin with. ""This Wreckage"" isn't a song you would expect to begin the album with (not much energy to it). ""Trois Gymnopedies"" (First Movement) is very good though. Gary Numan does deserve credit. There's no doubt he was the leader of the pack in the synthesizer revolution."
1,"What's This, I thought you were a real Queen Rasta-","Stay away.....I am certain these new 2005 japan releases are repackaged, re-engineered versions of tracks from the albums you regret you bought from the Japanese before. I am also certain no famous Marley queen that i know is going to care because them ain't her releases and she getting nice checks to keep quiet. Dem mobsters got the Queen alright.Yes I, Respect, always and only to the most high almighty, give thanks."
5,Exceptional organist/pianist companion!,"As church organist/pianist, I have utilized this hymnal almost every Sunday for the past 20+ years! Hymns from it are suitable for regular worship, at times of meditation (communion/during prayer), for preludes/postludes, as well as, weddings, funerals, and baptisms. To this day I have never found a better compilation of hymns encompassing multiple faiths, all religious seasons, and including all the ""old favorites"". I'm just ordering my second copy...as the cover on my first one (originally purchased as a gift for me by my mother at a Bill Gaither Trio concert-way back in the late 70's) has finally fallen apart! Don't be without this one! I highly recommend it!"
5,Thankfully Received!,"My Hymn book disappeared. I searched every corner of our house, in vain. Almost a year did I search. I thought it had mistakenly been thrown out. The newly ordered hymn book arrived. One week before the hymn book arrived at our house, the old one turned up. My grandson from afar had borrowed it unknown to me. Now, I have two of the same. The lost was found! This is a hymn book worth having two in the house!Love Reaching: Hymns for the Family of God (Special Edition)"
4,Slayer still has it!,"To be honest, when I first got this album I didn't like it too much. It was cool but not a big deal. But lately I've been getting more aquainted(sp) with this CD and I'm starting to like it even more. In this CD Slayer doesn't sell out and tone down. This is still pure thrash. Slayer thrash! The best thrash metal!"
3,couple of really great songs,"songs like dittohead and fictional reality realy brought the hardcore punk/metal scene into recognition. the lyrics of the album are good, ranging from love, death, hate, anarchy, and antichrist. i would recommend this album"
4,Divinely Intervent,"Divine Intervention's production seems dusty, raw, and gritty with merky guitars, rumbling bass, and hammering drums. Slayer take on a different approach writing ""Divine Intervention"". The chug guitar deliverance of King and Hanneman, waltzy at times, bring mid-tempo grooving, and shorter, well-stuctured songs.Paul Bostaph filling in for the departed drummer, Dave Lombardo, supplies a new vision in thrash drumming techniques. Bostaph features a different style of playing utilizing more fills and cymbal techniques. Gravitating polyrhythmic drum patterns hold Hanneman, King, and Araya, in a sea of texture and layers. Araya has sincerity and clarity oozing for his vocals. Artwork features a poster-esque fold out, beholding photos of the band, and lyrics: Violence vs. Music.*Killing Fields*Sex.Murder.Art*Fictional Reality*Divine Intervention*SS-3*Serenity in Murder*213"
5,SLAAAAAYYEEEEEERRRRRRR!!!!!!,"DIVINE INTERVENTION is another great THRASH album by the legendary SLAAAAAAAYYYYEEERRRR!!!!!! in my opinion it[s on par with the BEST STUFF SLAYER created like REIGN IN BLOOD and SEASONS IN THE ABYSS....the BEST METAL DRUMMER EVER DAVE LOMBARDO is not on the drums, but Paul Bostaph did a great job here!!!!!well, it[s one of my favorites with thrash gens like FICTIONAL REALITY, SEX MURDER ART, DITTOHEAD and SERENITY IN MURDER!!!!! WELL DONE, SLAYER!!!!!! MASTERS OF THRASH!!!!!!!!!"
3,A good producer should have 'intervened',"I love Slayer, but this CD was disappointing - you really had to train your ears to hear beyond the trash to hear the Araya-Hannemann magic that is so much of what Slayer thrash is. After 'Seasons', 'Reign', 'South of Heaven' and 'Diabolus', hearing this CD was a total letdown. I just saw them in concert, and I think they only played 1 song off this loser. Heck, every band has their lemons - and in the discography of Slayer, this one sits at the bottom for me - no crime, just a warning!Slayer are by FAR the best thrash-metal band of the past 2 decades - sticking to their roots past their at-the-time contemporaries (Metallica, Megadeth, etc). Don't take this review as a knock of Slayer, just some advice to say that amongst their wide selection, choose another one first, and then maybe check this one out...it just may be 'divine' for you..."
5,Psychotic,"That is just what this album is. The music on this album is pure chaos and that is the way metal should be. If you don't like Slayer's Divine Intervention, then sorry, you don't like real heavy metal. The CD is fast, furious, and in your face. It only stops when the CD stops. All metal should revolve around the style of Slayer."
4,METAL MANIA GOLORE,"Slayer's ""Divine Intervention is a perfect example of unhinged primal fury. As always, Hanneman and Araya do an excellent job of keeping the chaos contained in a tight package. I really enjoyed this album, it ranks up with their early stuff."
3,Meh,"I'm pretty new to Slayer; a buddy introduced me to their music about 2 years ago. I ordered Reign in Blood and Seasons in the Abyss first and loved them. Based on the Amazon reviews and Wikipedia article, Divine Intervention seemed like the next logical album in my Slayer collection, but it's not up to the same standard.I was attracted to Slayer for the high-speed, high-intensity music, especially because it helps me focus during high-concentration activities like design or analysis. It also helps drown out my annoyingly chatty coworkers during those same activities. Reign in Blood and Seasons in the Abyss delivered on every track. Divine Intervention fits the bill on some, maybe even a majority of tracks, but too many for my taste are (relatively) slow and gimmicky.I guess I shouldn't be surprised; Reign in Blood set an almost impossible standard to maintain. Now I'm spoiled for ever."
2,Slayer's downside,This Cd to me just seems bland for some reason. I get bored listening to it. There seems to be nothing that really stands out on it like other Slayer CDs do. Some say Diablous was not their best but i disagree i think this one was not their best effort. There was nothing to get your attention on this one. If all Slayer CDS were like this one i would not listen to them.
2,Best part was intro on first track,"I owned a number of Slayer CDs that I'd grown quite fond of, already (Seasons in the Abyss, Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Hell Awaits, Decade of Aggression, etc.) and ran out to buy Divine Intervention as soon as I heard that intro to the first track, at my friend's house. Such a pity that it was the best part of the whole CD!!! I was really let down with this one. I regard it as Metallica's Black album or Sepultura's Chaos A.D. - a sell-out. From those albums on, I have not been interested in any of those bands."
4,Good but not a Classic,"Unlike albums that came after it, Divine Intervention maintains the Slayer sound of their earlier discs. It is faster and thrashier and the sound is better than on Seasons in the Abyss but the songwriting is not as strong. Dittohead is the best song, but Killing Fields, Circle of Beliefs and 213 are good, too. I usually skip Sex.Murder.Art and Fictional Reality.Bottom line - I you like 80s Slayer you will probably like this, too. I don't find myself listening to it as much as South of Heaven, Reign in Blood, Hell Awaits and Show No Mercy but I put it in and enjoy it when I feel like listening to something different. Needless to say it's far superior to recent trash like God Hates Us All."
3,"Where is the PASSION in this band, people?","That's great and all that every ""metal head"" known to man loves this band. I don't see what's so special. They're music is fast and furious, but who cares? I look for PASSION in music and I just don't feel it from these guys. They have NO PASSION! It's just stupid lyrics with no raw emotion or unbridled energy behind it. Take Korn's first album or Machine Head or Max cavalera from Soulfly and Sepultura fame. Those guys have PASSION and you can feel it when they play. Slayer is just a lot of repetitive noise with no feeling. Even Celine Dion has more PASSION than these guys. They just play loud, speedy metal. Impressive, but it doesn't touch my soul!"
4,Divine Intervention review,"Divine Intervention in my opinion is a great album. I like it cause it has some killer thrashy riffs. New addition Paul Bostaph on the skins simply kills. In my opinion this is slayers last good album before they slipped into the nu metal fad. Tracks I recommend listening to are Killing Fields, Serenity in Murder and Circle of Beliefs for starters. Those are fast ones, but the album is not without groove(the title track and 213). From start to finish the album keeps the intensity. I think the album has its own sound but retains the good elements slayer was known for. For a fan of thrash I would recommend purchasing the album if you do not have it already."
3,good but a little choppy,First things first. Lombardo is not on here. Bostaph is a very good drummer but he isn't the right drummer for slayer. That title belongs to Lombardo and him only. Now to the review. This a good album and now a bit overlooked and forgotten. It still has some slamming songs but this is the last Slayer I usually reach for.To their credit the sound is actually heavier than ever but the songs are just not the classics of the previous three. This still belongs in any Slayer collection. This is Slayer in transition. A new drummer and new decade and now competing with the death metal movement. The best song is the title track.
4,good stuff,"This is the first Slayer record I ever heard and even though its not as good as their previous 3 cds, this is still reall good music. My biggest gripe is the weird sounding production and inconsistent guitar tone. I read a quote from KK saying that they were moved to 4 different studios or something during the recording process so when it came time for mixing, it was tough to get everything sounding right. Still, the sound is not too bad and the songs are as good as ever. This is probably the bands most technical album as well. Best track is Dittohead."
3,Probably best to wait.,"Definitely a first attempt for Hall. His structure is good but not great in that he tends to concentrate too much on secondary characters to the detriment of the reader's ability to maintain that armchair grip so necessary in today's explosion of efforts in the thriller genre. Also not particularly well edited in that I found myself turning back the occasional page to wonder why the same word or phrase slipped in too often when careful editing would have assured a finer edge.Overall, a good shot and a very promising beginning. With polish and practice (and a new editor, perhaps), I look forward to very enjoyable Hall tomes in the future. Worth reading but certainly not the peak read of your year."
3,Starts out with a bang and ends with an implausible whimper,"Great title. Jacket graphics motivated me to buy it.I thought I had found a gem of an escapist thriller until halfway through the book, it began to meander and lose its focus. Too much going on. The author's compulsion to tidy up the rationale for all his characters' increasingly improbable actions became tedious (a quality I am trying to avoid when I set aside several hours to read a book.) I have renewed my determination to put aside a book that begins to unravel at its midpoint"
5,I loved the vocals and harmonies on this CD.,"What impressed me most about this CD was the different styles of songs. ""Isn't It Funny"" is an upbeat pop/rock song, ""Picasso"" is a fun pop song, ""Love Changes Everything"" has an island sound with steel drums, ""Fractured Queen"" has cool guitar and great harmonies, ""When The Train Comes"" is a country song, ""Here In The Darkness"" is powerful rock song, ""Answers"" is another great pop song, ""Give Me 'Til Morning"" is a cajun/country song, ""Masquerades"" is another great pop song, and then ""Last Dance"" is a nice ballad."
5,UNDER-RATED !!!!,"This is one of BC's most under rated efforts...The songwriting & musicianship reflects the band's expansion into broader fields of influence, and shows their willingness to chart a new course. Since BC are aways being compared to The Rolling Stones, this is the type of album the Stones should have made after Some Girls !!!...Long Live Chris & Rich and may come back very soon !!!!!"
5,best crowes album imho,"I got this on cassette when it first came out. I had to buy it on CD cause of the clarity. Awesome album. Hard to rate it better than southern harmony, but I think its a little better. I have all their albums and think they are one of the few good bands around today."
3,The Weakest...but still pretty good.,"This is easily the weakest Black Crowes release, but still well worth checking out. There are a handful of classics - Good Friday, One Mirror Too Many and Evil Eye are the best. The rest are solid, if unimpressive, Black Crowes fare. I agree with the other reviewers who describe this as unfocused and erratic. This is not the most energetic or engaging of their releases.If you are looking for the definitive Black Crowes release go directly to ""The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion."" That is their masterpiece."
5,One of the great listening experiences of the late 90's,"A masterpiece. If you appreciate listening to the essence of the human condition in the rock medium, you need to hear this album. If you haven't heard it before you die, it will be a tragedy."
1,Noisy and annoying!,"Hmmm, Black Crowes...well...To me, and obviously to a lot of other people, Black Crowes music is very influenced by Rolling Stones but Stones have something that Black Crowes lack - it takes more than pot, attitude and a slobby approach to be a rock and roll band. Of course they managed to perform one or two great numbers every once in a while, but mostly it's rather boring and the vocals can really annoy you. This release includes NO great tune at all, the only decent one is ""Just say you're sorry"". The rest is awful!Once I had four Black Crowes albums. First I sold ""Amorica"", and now is this one ""Three snakes..."" in the pile for cd's to be sold. That leaves me with ""The southern harmony..."" and ""By your side""...for the moment..."
4,missing their normal magic,"Personally, I love this album, but it is not up to par with their prior outings, Amorica and Southern Harmony, although both are a tough act to follow. The band was in turmoil for this one. Interviews with some members indicated that Marc Ford appeared only sparingly for the recording because of personal problems. However, the album is consistently strong with some great tunes. How Much for your wings, Let me share the ride, good friday, evil eye, and Nebakhanezer make this album a great listen. This album, whose songs aren't played live much anymore, made for great live performances at the time the band was touring. Better when your not alone sounds kinda lovey dovey, but I heard them open with it in concert and have loved it ever since. Great lyrics and some really original tunes (i.e. evil eye, nebak., and wings). Only thing missing is a consistently strong lead guitar which prior recordings had."
3,Just OK,"As a reading teacher for 11 years I found this book to be cute but just OK overall. The writing is weak and the touch and feel aspect is just average. I bought this book for my daughter at age 1, and she thought it was OK. It never became one she requested. She is crazy about dogs but even that aspect couldn't save this book's weak story line. She prefers other touch and feel books we have as well."
1,Not Good,"These covers are well-made, but become a real nuisance in use. I bought them to help protect my graphite shafts during the jostling they endure during a round of golf. If you have steel shafts, covers are unnecessary. Even given my graphite set, the covers were hard to get on and off of the oversized heads (Mizuno) and easy to misplace or lose.I tied them (strings included) in pairs, so I wouldn't have to worry about leaving them all over the course, but they were still a pain to use.I finally removed them altogether and they now occupy my box of golf gadgets that clutter up my garage. I figure if the shafts get too banged up through frequent use (no sweat so far), I'll have an excuse to get new ones or talk my wife into a new set of irons!"
5,Title tells it all!!!,"Searching for great songs, plunged into southern R&B;, full of filthy guitars, harmonica and a singer with soul......this is the one and only CD! ""Sting me"" as well as ""Remedy"" don't need an intro anymore!!! But take a break and listen to songs 5, 6, 7, 8 one after another: awesome music!!!Best Crowes CD ever if you'll ask me with a sound that's very close to their live performance... (Ordered 'War paint' but haven't receiced it yet)"
5,Excellent,"If you are a Black Crowes fan, you must have this one in your collection! Great rockin' tunes from Chris Robinson and company! Stand out tune in this collection: ""Remedy!"""
4,Another modern Classic,This cd has some of my favorite Crowes tunes on it. I love sometimes salvation. I love the guitar work on this album.
4,Like Fine Wine,"When this album first came out, I didn't like it too much. I think I was expecting a little more edge like ""Shake Your Money Maker"". I tossed it aside and basically forgot about it. A few years ago I picked it up again and WOW! This is a GREAT album and I like it more and more each time I listen to it.Here are some of my favorites (although I really do like all the songs): ""Remedy"", ""Thorn In My Pride"", ""Sometimes Salvation"". And be sure to give ""Hotel Illness"" a listen, it's my personal favorite on the whole album."
5,"If you feel like a riot, then don&#65533;t you deny it.","This opening line tells you everything you need to know. Lock up your daughters, batten down the hatches and get ready for a ho-down. The Black Crowes are here to kick your ass.It's rockin', rollin' and down-right cool. And I mean REAL cool. Take four southern gentlemen and add attitude, whiskey, no nonsense song writing, fantastic guitars and a vocalist who sings like he means it and what you end up with is one of the best straight ahead, boogie-woogie rock albums of the 1990s.If you like to swagger, strut and dance across the kitchen floor - then give it a go."
4,The Best Intro to (and Album Of) the Crowes.,"This really isn't much better than ""Shake Your Money Maker"", but since sophomore efforts are usually worse than originals, you have to give it credit. Not only does it have a lack of horrid songs (a record for this band), it's also the most soul-oriented album by the Crowes.The album gets high marks for such precious songs as ""Stng Me"" ""Remedy"" ""Black Moon Creeping"" and the Crowes best moment since ""She Talks to Angels"", ""Sometimes Salvation"". Few low marks come from persistant gospel choir, the urge to end each song with a five second fool-around-with-the-instruments-like-an-orchestra thing, and the usual Crowe flaws. If the band never comes up with a five-star effort, this will remain its triumph.Overall, I'd give it a 92, with an extra 7 points for ""Sometimes Salvation""."
3,"Great songs, horrible mastering.","As good as the songs and performances are, this particular edition is an absolute friggin' disaster. It's an overcompressed, distorted blast of midrange square waves. What a shame."
3,Needs too much direct light and universal adapter,"The folks that made this NEED to make a universal adapter that comes with this. Just giving a cigarette car receptical is idiotic. Also, there is no explanation on how to serially connect these units. The container it came in was too tall, too thin walled and flimsy, and came with a huge stupid hook at the top of it. I ended up having to make my own durable, more fitting container. Not sure it's worth the money unless you are stuck in a garbage dump like Africa where half the time I never had electricity."
2,C*p K*ller???,"All the tracks here are album versions except for the legendary ""Cop Killer"" which is, understandable, very heavily censored. An interesting find if you can get it for a few dollars (the ""radio"" version of ""Cop Killer"" is unintentionally hysterical) but not worth collectors prices unless you really believe that early 90's rap/metal crossover is a collectible market."
3,What a price!?,"This was a nice camera when it was first released, but what's with the PRICE?!?! Tell me it's a typo!For that price I'd rather pick up a Minolta Dimage 7i!!JMHO,StMute"
3,Not the best choice.,"Pick this camera up and you'll be reminded of the heft of older, metal-bodied 35mm film cameras. It seems that the SLR setup has added a significant weight burden, while supposedly lending better optics to the camera. In this price range, most digital cameras now offer potent optical zoom lenses (7-10x not uncommon), while the 620 makes do with a marginal 3:1 setup. In addition, while most offer resolutions in the 3+ megapixel range, the 620 is a 2.1 megapixel camera. While there are some user-controlled features that make it fun to use, it is still pretty much a computer chip controlled digicam with a particularly slow autofocus system. In this price range, I'll take the Olympus 700 anyday!"
2,Impossible to use for Vinyasa,"The mat is soft and comfortable, but is completely impossible to use for Vinyasa or flow yoga when you aren't sweaty. Your feet simply do not stick to the soft mat, making downward dog and other basic postures very difficult. I have not yet tried it for hot yoga, but suspect it will only work once I'm soaked with sweat. I think the mat will work well for meditation though, since it's so soft and comfortable. I went with a jute mat instead."
4,Nice Material but over priced,"I returned this product because I found it unnecessary for Bikram yoga. It is a beautiful mat but overpriced for what it is - a thin rug. It reminded me of a kitchen or bathroom rug. A towel will do for most hot yoga but if you want a distinct mat and don't mind spending the money,I would highly recommend this mat."
3,Color samples are mislabeled,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter. It arrived on time and safely. I was expecting the pastel rose as it is depicted in the sample photo. A pastel lime green rug was delivered. Imagine my surprise. The photos don't match the items, colorwise. Caveat emptor."
2,Yoga mat is now a rug,"I am disappointed with this yoga mat, I do not recommend it. It is slippery and hard to use. After storing it for months, I now use it as a rug."
4,"Cliche, but extremely well done.","I agree the movie is basically Rocky set in the Depression era. However, it is a story told extremely well. Crowe does an amazing job of portraying the too-good-to-be-true boxer without becoming maudlin. Crowe disappears into the role. He exhibits a quiet dignity throughout the movie. Rene Z. as his wife and Giamatti as his manager are great as well. The movie also focuses on the minor characters and the milieu of the depression era. The movie brings out the despair of the country and how an over-the-hill boxer sparked hope in so many people. One of the best scenes is when the wife goes to the local parish to pray for her husband and finds the church already full of people praying for him. It sounds trite, but it works. I don't know how Ron Howard balanced the emotions so well. I took off a star because it is a story told so many times. My wife did not care for it. She dislikes boxing."
5,Easy,"Had to order it for a class paper, streaming quality and speed consistent and clear. No lag, and instant availability numerous times within the 24 hour rental period"
2,Not for us.,I thought maybe this would be some great music for massage. Thought that there would be some audio cues as to when to move on to a different part of the body. Instead it was like a bad audio seminar with not so relaxing music. I sent it back.
5,What Makes a Rainbow?,"This is an excellent book, not only for kids to learn the colors and order of a rainbow, but also to talk about different animals and their colors. I read this book with my kindergarten class and they loved it -- especially how the ribbons pop up after every turn of the page. Overall a great book for learning or just for reading aloud!"
5,Beautiful Book,This book completely fascinates my daugthers (4 and almost 3). They think it's wonderful that has you turn the page another bright coloured ribbon appears - and as you go through the book a rainbow is made.It's a really lovely story about a rabbit and rainbow and a lovely way to learn colours.I think it's a wonderful book to give as a gift and one that will be enjoyed for many years.
2,More to it than colors,"My daughter likes this book, though I change the words when I read it to her. I give the female characters a title (Ms.) to show the respect that the male characters get (they're all referred to as Mr.). I also change the end to make it true; water droplets and sunshine make a rainbow, not colors. The ribbons are a cute idea, but little hands are very tempted to pull them. I prefer other books to teach children colors."
2,"The more I read it, the more it bugs me that....",the male 'friends' are addressed as Mr. ('Mr. Fox') while the female 'friends' in the book are addressed without any similar formality but simply by their 'first' name(Bluebird). It is easy enough for me to change the words as I read it to my children and I DO really love the concept of the ribbons (and am not too bothered by the technical inaccuracies) but my goodness does the sexism make me angry! This is actually the first review I have ever written... perhaps not the last.
4,Lovely book,"What a cool idea! My daughter loves this book. The colours are vibrant and the story is cute. Although I too did have an issue with it straying from the ROYGBIV order, I can see how difficult it would be to find two creatures to portray two purple colours. Not sure if there is such a thing as a purple butterfly?!"
1,CAUTION- RIBBONS ARE HAZARDOUS!!,"I loved this book until yesterday- my 19 month-old daughter was looking at books in the same room I was in.. She started crying and ran to me with the book hanging off of her wrist. Two of the ribbons were tightly wrapped around her wrist.. so tightly that I couldn't get my own finger under them or figure out how to unwind them. Luckily I had scissors nearby.. I had to cut the book off of her! I have noticed a discrepancy in the age range for this book on various websites.. Some say appropriate for age one.. I believe the book lists age 3. Regardless, I think it is a potential hazard for any child- toddler or 3 years old."
4,A Must Have for Every Child,"I teach a class of 2-3 year olds at a preschool, and this book is definately a favorite of my students. It's a great and fun way to learn and review colors. Every child should have this book!"
5,What Makes A Rainbow,This book has been a favorite for my three month old son. He loves the colorful pages and the pop up sun at the end of the book. We read this book almost daily to him. It will be a great start for him to learn his colors. Each page is filled with vibrant colors of the rainbow and is written simple enough for young children to understand. A must for every child.
5,"Science is BAD, mmkay?","Although you may think that rainbows are made by ROYGBIV and Sir Isaac Newton, you are wrong! Rainbows are made by God. When reciting and drawing the colors in a rainbow, your children will probably get this wrong if they believe what they read in this book.If we really want to get technical here the rainbow is a continuous spectrum of colors so the number of colors in a rainbow is not fixed at seven.[This is a wonderful board book that stands out from among many others because it tells a story and has a nice surprise in in the end. Other board books have simple sentences describing actions or one word exclamations that never seem to capture my child's attention.]"
5,Good memories!!,"My sister and I watched these shows growing up and laughed so hard...well, I'll just leave it at that. Thank you for a fast and easy transaction. Fast shipping. Excellent packaging. Buy with confidence from this seller. Quality product. As described."
5,Jerry Lewis Rocks!,"The Master. Unfortunately, we don't find this type of humor anymore, so we need to keep it alive."
3,"These selections are fair, but not ""Way...way out"" there","It makes you wonder ""whose minding the store"" when these companies put these compilations together. Don't get me wrong, there's a few goodies here. But those of you out there know, there were these few selections that we didn't mind seeing over and over again. For example, there are four sleeper classics which all of Jerry's kids should have for their personal collection: 1) Way...way out 2) Visit to a small planet 3) The Big Mouth and 4)Whose minding the store? Why these outrageous comedy films weren't included, only Mr. Quimby knows! These films, in my opinion, were of the same caliber as the Nutty Professor and should have been added. Hopefully, someone will see fit to include them in the next collection."
5,Great value,My family love all of these movies. We love to have lunch together and watch one of his movies in this collection. No viewing problems.
5,The legendary Jerry Lewis collections,I enjoy the whole volume and watch them everyday. the movies are in excellent image and the picture is just the way it was when I saw them when I was a little girl.thank you!
2,"Where is ""Who's Minding the Store""?!?!","I guess it's my fault... I put ""Who's Minding the Store"" into the Amazon search field - and clicked SEARCH. This is the first match that came up. I assumed... being a collection of Jerry Lewis... that is was part of it. It isn't.1. That alone is bad enough - not to inlcude what is one of his finest works...2. Why does this come up as a match when there is nothing in this collection about that movie?It's unfortunate..."
2,False Advertising,"Although the book is in decent condition, it is completely black and white, not to mention is is the paperback edition, and not the hardcover as advertised."
5,superb physiology text,"Thorough, clear, great figures/diagrams. I've used this textbook for 2 classes and refer to it periodically when I have questions about health and the body's workings. Gives a good overview of topics, as well as useful details."
2,This is not the paperback edition of the textbook,"This book appears from amazon.com to be simply the paperback edition of the regular textbook, but it is not. Ordering this will get you a paperback ""Study Guide"" instead. The book is misrepresented or not clearly labeled on this site, and I suppose the phrase ""5th sg"" is supposed to be enough for us to tell what it is. Don't order this thinking that you will get a paperback edition of the textbook."
4,Bulgarian Tomatoes,"A biography on Khrushchev...and Bulgarian Tomatoes, how do they relate? This biography contains numerous details which one probably does not really care to know, but is loaded with information on the guy himself and how he rose to power. I would reccommend this for IB history classes, which helps to understand the cold war. The end section, which contains documents is rather interesting and simple to follow. There is one document on Khrushchev's views on Bulgarian tomatoes, which is rather interesting. However, the British spellings can be annoying for American readers, but should not hinder anyone's desire to purchase this. It is deffinently great material to be used in a seminar."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"There are no words to convey how boring and at times confusing this book was! He's on my ""bad author"" list! BarbaraForests of the Night: A Novel"
5,"A COMPLEX, FASCINATING BOOK","This was an excellent book. I love how we are given seemingly irrelevent information, which is made clear and all fits together by the end of the book. The dialogue is real, which is something i find lacking in many of these suspense novels today. The storyline is complex and interesting, and makes for a great read.(It would make an awesome movie, too)"
2,Not up to Hall's standards,"Forests of the Night starts out promising. The main characters - Charlotte and Parker and their daughter Gracey - were certainly unusual and likeable at first. I was about a hundred pages in before I realized that this was a very silly book. The emotions of Charlotte and Parker became very contrived, and their relationship was just not worth reading about. The daughter receded more into her make believe world as the book plodded along, and her insanity did not make her a likeable or interesting character, just a schizoid nuisance. I've got about a hundred more pages to go, so I think I'll just have to tough it out.I have now (almost) read all of James W. Hall's books, and all the others merit five stars. He's a great entertainer and has been truly excellent at developing fun and interesting characters, with relationships sometimes touching on the wacky and weird. I just don't understand how he let this dog out of the cage."
4,Classic James W. Hall,Riveting. Great story using the Cherokee's plight in America over the years as a backdrop to murder and mayhem!!
5,A great story.,"Hall takes a break from his wonderful Thorn character stories and instead takes us on a wild goose chase from Florida to Carolina. All the while, the good guys, the bad guys and the ones we haven't made our minds up on yet, suffer and benefit from the choices of their youth. Youthful binges, indescretions, lost loves, etc. they all come back to roost for these people, and that is the beautiful part of the book. It's full of unique characters. If you grew up in the southeast and went to summer camps in North Carolina like i did this is a must read. For everybody else who is a returning fan of the Thorn mysteries, this is a welcome escape and is enjoyable as a stand alone."
2,mediocre departure,"This was a ho-hum effort from Mr. Hall; a departure from his Keys novels starring Thorn (a Travis McGee take-off). For modern crime novels, the better bet is to go with Dennis Lehane, Thomas Harris, Randy Wayne White (for Florida suspense), and if you are looking for satire, Carl Hiaasen. Hall is a superb wordsmith, sets a scene nicely, however, too often his plots are either unbelievable or without suspense. This book portends to have both, but falls short on both counts.Have to say, save the money and pass on this one."
5,Timeless,This book is simply timeless. For anyone starting out or for anyone returning after not piping for a while this book is a must have!
3,Problems with the JVC XV-501BK DVD Player,"As one of the earlier reviewers has written, the player could not play ""Cruel Intentions"" additionally my Player would not read ""The Mummy"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". It will read my other DVDs. Question is what should I be looking for on the DVD to determine if my JVC will be able to read it. From the reviews it appears to have problems reading a ""double layered"" DVD."
3,Nothing Special,"I'm a luthier and have bought several pieces of this one and the hotrail one. Musicians Gear has two kind of Duncan Performer. This model and the other is the Rail one. This Detonator model has nothing special, just like those high output stock humbucker pickups. The Hot Rail model pickups are better than many other hotrails."
5,A masterpiece to be reckoned with! Beautifully written!,"Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc is a different type of masterpiece, portraying the life of one of the world's greatest people, and showing the more serious side of Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens). ""Joan of Arc"" is narrated by Joan's best friend Louis, who follows Joan's life from her childhood to her tragic death ""saying I was at her side through everything, and mine was the last human hand she touched"". This book is known as Twain's personal favorite of all his works because he considered her ""the most amazing person the human race has ever produced..."" Though different in fictional aspects from the equally excellent CBS movie (with Peter O'Toole and Leelee Sobieski) all the material seems to fit into place nicely. Twain spent twelve years researching archives and trial notes for this book. Reading this book will make people love and recognize Joan d'Arc for who she was even more."
3,Not for D5100! Get another a,"Despite the fact that it is listed on Amazon as compatible with the D5100, it will not fit in the compartment. A small tab prevents it from going in. The adapter you need is the EP-5a. I cannot speak for other cameras, and I have not tried the EP-5a yet, but after being disappointed when it arrived, I checked more thoroughly and found that answer on Nikon's website."
5,Nikon EP-5 Power Supply Connector for EH-5 AC Adapter,Nikon EP-5 Power Supply Connector for EH-5 AC AdapterGot the item as described. Work like a charm.
2,only for hot rod enthusiasts,"It was an informative book, but not what I was looking for. It dealt entirely with older cars (aka hot rods) and didnt come close to touching on any newer cars and the custom panelling or anything that would go into them."
3,Good reading,Great lay out and informative. A bit elementary but great for beginners. If you are going for sweet short cuts this will help
3,Custom Auto Interiors,"The print was OK, but the binding would take a lot to be desired. I would NEVER give this book to a friend as a gift. It was loosely bound & looked as if a child's first attempt at Binding a book. The print was Good & thats all I was concerned with."
2,Almost Unreadable Font in Kindle Edition,"This review doesn't refer to the writing itself, but rather the clumsy Kindle edition released for this product. The Kindle book seems to be constructed from a scan of the paper book, which has an ornate, faux-calligraphic font. This font, given the screen resolution of the Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite, is almost unreadable at a normal size.Don't buy this Kindle edition."
3,Pretty Tame Stuff,"I had to see what all the hubbub was about the infamous Marquis, only to find that his writing is pretty tame, reminds me of back in the Sixties when ""Midnight Cowboy"" had an X-Rating, today it would be PG-13, Same with De Sade, well Maybe an R rating."
1,No artistic merit whatsoever,"Sade's style is pedestrian, monotonous - not dissimilar to Camus' I'etranger (although Camus used this matter of fact style as a vehicle for conveying the protagonist Meursault's lack of passion and creativity.) Sade, however lacks the ablilty to write, and if it were not for the graphic and highly contraversial subject matter of 120 days, this piece of junk would have been discarded ago."
1,Depravity disguised as avant-garde intellectualism,"The only possible value of de Sade's writing is to show how anyone, no matter how degenerate, can cloak his ideas in false intellectualism. De Sade advocates a reversion to barbarism, to an ethic of might makes right. De Sade's intellectual rehabilitiation is one of the great crimes of the 20th century. Anyone who finds de Sade appealing should read Roger Shattuck, ""Forbidden Knowledge: From Prometheus to Pornography."""
1,Revolting,I bought this book based on the product description and what I read on the descriptions on goodreads. This book sounded like it would be great but I was definitely fooled.It is revolting to read about all of the child molestations and the true cruelty to some of the characters in this book.It was absolutely filthy. I went ahead and continued reading the book just for the fact I paid for it and it was the first book I bought on my Kindle. Now that I am getting closer to the end I feel I just can not take anymore of this insane behaivor.
1,The Most Hateful Book I've Ever Read,"The idea of awarding stars to The Marquis De Sade for his sexual torture tome 'The 120 Days Of Sodom' is radically absurd. What, exactly, is there to congratulate him for? Writing an utterly pointless, sickening book? Depicting a world full of hate and cruelty, obsessions with destroying beauty and inflicting pain for sexual gratification? Wow, let's give this guy a pat on the back. He deserves a star. I implore anyone not to read this book. The only reason one might want to read it is to explore the furthest extremes of human cruelty. Granted, this is quite compelling in itself but, far more so, it leaves a very bad impression on the brain. What they do to Augustine is the worst."
1,the most horrible thing ever imagined,"dear god! i had heard that this book was notriously sick and outrageous. i just figured ""okay, it's gonna be a little rough."" but i had no idea! take the most awful image in your mind and read about it and things that are actually worse. some parts left me quesy, and some of it made me feel like crying. de sade has written about [all sorts of sexualsituations]. If you [like] the freaky stuff by all means enjoy this little ""treasure"". but if you're like me, a curious 16 year old boy, stay away. fight the temptation because this will haunt you till the day you die. did i mention it's over 400 pages long?"
1,Unimaginable Cruelty,"I ordered this to reference while reading Black Dalia Avenger by Steve Hodel. I didn't buy into his theory of the murders until I checked against this book. I understand his theory on these real life murders now, but wished I never perused this book"
1,Filthy but does add to the story,I went into this book knowing it would be filthy. However the amount of degradation that the book goes into does not add to the story.
3,a naughty fairy tale; real life is far more horrifying...,"I found this book to be rather obvious in it's intentions. De Sade uses graphic descriptions of torture and sexual abuse to promote his philosophical agenda. Kind of like bait and switch, he ensnares the average(albeit disgusted) reader with nauseating scenes while out of view there is something far more sublime going on....Frankly, I enjoyed some of the sexual stuff, and I must admit I became rather aroused at times. I BELIEVE THIS TO BE DE SADE'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE with this work.Considering the reaction this book caused, I think I am not the only person to feel this way."
4,de Sade's the Man,If you can get beyond all the sex stuff you'll find one amazing philosopher. The guy was in prison for his thoughts back then and yet they still shock us today. A mind bender. Not a great work of literary art perhaps but stimulating mental fodder for sure.
5,Sade the true master,"This is the masterpiece by a man who was truly free in the mind, this is a dark book, but it is a good study on human's sexual nature and this man gave me ideas i could never have thought of fully by myself, this man was a genious and those who see this man as just a crazy pervergt, is wrong because he knew nature and that thre should be only one type of freedom that which is in your head, this is one of my top five books because it gives me ideas for books and as a modern day libertine i can see where he found his pleasures,this is a cult classic but even far beyond it is a classic of a time when men where men and women were women, this is the the true man who inspires me and i hope to meet him in the afterlife, for thoses who like beliefs this is a good book to look at as long as you do not want nightmeres and are open to new things"
1,Serial Killer's Fantasy,I was reading an interview with serial-killer Richard Ramirez (the night stalker)and in it he talks about this book and De Sade in general. He was reading Justine at the time the article was written and I can't help but wonder why death-row inmates are allowed access to this type of reading material. I can see why he is so fasinated by this book - it reads like a serial killer's to-do list. Very sick stuff.
5,Very Strange But Typical Of The Times,"I must disagree with most of the reviews that I read. While it is boring because of its repitions on sex, it is typical of the times that it was written in. While I have not read this version, I have read another one which gave some historical information. It may have been the first issue. De Sade was something of a quandry to the reveloutionists. He supported them strongly, but was of the nobility. The only thing they could do with him was to confine him to an insane assylum, which they did. Many of the stories were preformed there as well as many of the pervisions. Life was cheap then and if any one died from the preformances, it was one less mouth to feed for the government and they did not cause the death. This whole book was filmed during WWII by the Nazis using Jewish prisoners and the film is in the archives of the Nurenburg tribunal which used it to convict the criminals that did it."
4,nausea...at its finest,"At parts I found this book to be stimulating. It made the mind wander. It was overall disgusting and filthy. A person with a great imagination and innocent mind should not read it. Although I could hardly stomach many of the horrible deeds commited in this book, I give it four stars for imagination and concentration on the subject at hand."
5,Tough subject handled brilliantly!,"Spiritual warfare and demonic strongholds and the effects they have on our lives are difficult subjects.We can't live life believing there's a demon on our back all the time, and blame it for our poor choices and/or difficult circumstances. However, it's clear in the Bible that spiritual warfare is prevalent and does effect us all in some way.Frangipane deals with these subjects sensitively and powerfully with solid Biblical backup and experiences he's had in his life.I particularly found the study of Jezebel very interesting and revealing having also studied Revelation recently. I found Frangipane's treatment of it a revelation in my life and very helpful.Highly recommend this as an eye-opener to spiritual strongholds and best of all will encourage you to start talking with the Lord about it. Any book that leads us to our knees (for training) is always excellent."
5,This is Truth,"Francis Fragipane is the most talented, gifted, and inspired Christian author alive today. He speaks a deep Truth, which is extremely challenging. This book is not for lightweights or those who are looking to become a Christian. It is a book for those people who are fearless in the pursuit of Truth. You must value freedom from deceit more than anything else to fully benefit from this book. Those who are under deceit, and wish to remain that way, should not read this book. This book will tear apart deceit and reveal the demons who rest inside of it. The demons will tell you to throw the book in a fire, and reject everything it says. This book is the demon's enemy. It is the friend of Jesus, who is the source for all Truth."
5,It falls into place naturally,"When I bought this book, I knew 52 people could not be wrong. I have been a Pentecostal Christian for 20 years, holy ghost filled for 11, am involved in intercessory prayer warfare and I was pretty sure with all my bible reading and prayer life,I had this ""yeah baby I'm good"" attitude. Well in the first page I was quickly brought down to earth. I have never heard nor read such insight of the word, especially the words of Jesus (and believe me I read a lot). So many preachers interpret Jesus' words differently. It seems like as soon as I start reading the introduction its like a light is switched on in my brain and the scriptures are illuminated. Long story short, buy this book, its one of the best books about christian life you will every read. You will not be disappointed if you are a layman or a preacherman."
5,This is a powerful book.,This is a must-read for every Christian. It details the struggles Christians have and cleared up alot of confusion. It talks about suffering and how we have to choice to turn our back on God or run towards Him when we are hurting. The foundational truths in this book gave me great peace and taught me how to work through the tough times. There is so much in the book that it needs to read and re-read to excavate all the hidden pearls of wisdom it contains.
5,Ready to fight?,"YOu may have heard it from different sources, but this one gives it in practical form. ""The Three Battlegrounds"" will shed much-needed light into the human experience for anyone of ANY faith. It is an easy read with much bang for the few bucks. Great for Sunday school, teen agers, and book club."
4,A great read,"The Three Battlegrounds distinguishes between Christianity, tradition and a relationship with Christ. You will find yourself going back to it time and time again."
3,What on earth?,"Though it works fine, it's curious that the brick I received doesn't connect to anything at all. The power cord itself loosely fits into my outlet and constantly pops out. However, it still works fine. Just try not to jostle it too hard."
1,broken cable,i received the PlayStation 2 Power cable and just behind the small connector that plugs directly into the machine the wire was broken on the inside. i had to duct tape the cord at a weird angle to my console just to get it to work at all.
1,Poorly written,Almost all the content of this book are duplicated from win32api.txt or somewhere before. The author should spend more time in explaining the technical details of win32 api functions and place more examples instead of dumping the win32api.txt into this book. It is a waste of tree resources. Very limited examples and very brief explanation. Don't buy this book unless you haven't heard or seen win32 API before. I regretted buying this book too.
1,should have been reduced to 40 pages and sold for one dollar,This book contains lots of cut and paste from the vb aip text file which comes free with VB. A few lightweight examples. Not worth it. A waste of good trees used to make the paper.
1,"On the whole, very poor!",The book is padded from cover to cover with a dump of the API text file! No body in their right mind would type a long API declaration when they can copy it from the API viewer. Hundreds of pages wasted just to make it look like a computer book (2.5 inches). What there is left is very poorly documented and the examples are useless from a learning standpoint. I suspect the 5 star rating by another reader was one of the books authors using a Hotmail account ...
1,Glad I bought the book,"Buying this book lead me to find the win32api.txt, which I now use in place of the book (its much better)."
1,Don't Buy This Book!,"This book is a great waste of paper. All functions, constants and structures declared can be found in the win32api.txt file that comes with VB. This book is a little handy for describing the what each argument means in an API declaration but it could definatly use ALOT more examples if not at least 1 for EACH function and not just 1 or 2 for the whole chapter (that would actually make it valuable). Knowing the meaning of each argument in an api declaration does not mean you automatically know how to use it. I bought this book to help me out on a project and it turned out to be a great waste of cash. Great reference book if you ALREADY know how to use the api."
2,Disappointed!,"Half of this book is a soft cover print of the Declares, Constants, and Structures found in the API Viewer of VB. Although some parameters in declares are listed, the brief explanation will leave you guessing. Also, code examples aren't well commented, making it hard to follow sometimes"
3,Somewhat satisfied... :-),"I purchased this gift for a friend who collects swords and daggers. The dragon design is what interested me most in that the details of it looked great...online. Once I got it, I noticed that on one side of it the flames that are painted on, apparently was chipped or scratched off in a few places. The blade was also loose, but it does have screws on the back side of the handle so you can tighten them. Despite these minor details, the person I got it for loved it."
3,Not the best,"I didn't love this book. The writing style is very strange - the author drops pronouns, squishes sentences together in strange ways, and generally makes it really hard to tell what on earth is happening. However, I tend to like traditional literature (Jane Austen) much more than I like more modern writing styles (DeLillo/Pynchon), so your mileage may vary."
2,Item Information Too Vague,"I was considering to buy this handbag, but I didn't buy it because of the very vague description of it. The most important lacking information is the dimensions of the bag. Why would they state the shipping weight and NOT the dimensions of this handbag? It doesn't make sense to me."
1,disappointing,"I usually like British comedies, but this one I found to be a big disappointment. Don't buy unless you've already seen an episode."
2,League of Gentlemen Series 2,"We thoroughly enjoyed the first season of League of Gentlemen, but the second series (or season) fell short. The same characters and same locations were used, but the writing wasn't as clever as in the first season. We don't know if we'll purchase the third season at this point."
3,Loved season one but second isn't as great....,"I loved the first season. Just loved it! Now that I finally got my hands on the second and third series it's more clear to me why I loved the first season so much. The first season was extraordinary British humor that we Americans don't get enough of. It was over the top, razor sharp wit with just enough real-world infused into it to make us all see ourselves in it and laugh that much harder. The second series is a rather different approach and departure with more blood and gore than anything else. It's not bad it's just not that good...if you know what I mean. The skits become so out-there that they lose a good portion of their punch. The ""local"" story goes to a place that is so silly you just start shaking your head rather than laughing. I am personally still morning the death of this brillant humor...."
4,Review of Disney A to Z,"The book contained all the Disney information available at the time. Unfortunately, it was published in 1996 and so is lacking a lot of current data."
5,Great Resource,"I love this book it gives you pretty much anything and everything a disney fan would want to know up to 2005-2006. There are photos and discriptions of movies, attractions, actors and actresses, books, if it has to do with Disney it's in there.The only thing is it's been 5 years since this was released and alot has happened it could use an update!Got my copy brand new for just $7."
4,Wanna know anything about Disney? This is your book!!,"My daughter (she is 10) saw this book in a store and wanted it. We told her to wait and we would get it at another time. Of course when we went back, it was gone. We took a trip to Disney World and so when we got back she had to have this book. I found it here online and I had to get it for her. She is constantly picking this book up and referring back to it. She comes to us asking if we knew this or that about movies or anything new she has discovered about Disney. It is a great book to learn alot about Everything Disney!! My daughter loves it!! If you love all things Disney and want to know all there is about it, this is the book!!"
4,Taut writing - a story of infidelity,"I was completely unaware of Eca De Queiros prior to reading this book. He is an excellent writer - although this is a slim volume it successfully moves it characters through a number of changes and emotions as a marriage unravels in infidelity. The portrayal of the emotions, their ""wallop"", will remain with you long after you've finished the novel and the plot line is forgotten - in this sense, those who read for the quality of the writing may enjoy this book more than those who read for action and plot."
4,De Quieros: A Final Post Script,"A terse novel published posthumously 25 years after the author's death. While not his best work, it does seem to capture a recurrent theme in many of his works -- the rejection of Victorian-era morality and propriety. De Quieros probes the subjects of marital infidelity, betrayl, honor, forgiveness and reconciliation in 112 pages! This is an enjoyable, quick primer to De Quieros. By all means pick this up and follow it with The Illustrious House of Ramires and/or The Relic...Happy Reading."
4,I enjoyed this for the same reasons I like Nabakov.,"This is the first of Eca de Queiros that I have read. His style is economical, his writing seems almost effortless. Likewise, his selection of details packs meaning. This is not a perfect book, but highly enjoyable in the way that fine improvisation satisfies."
1,short bulb life,"Rated as 3000 hour bulb life when purchased, today they claim 4000 hours.Bulb lasted only 900 hours. Service at ""unfocused"" does not care about creating a satisfied customer base. Would not replace bulb even on a prorated basis."
3,"Good picture for the price, short life span, bad customer service","I too have an X2 for the past 2 years and have now started seeing a verticle shadow on the right side of the screen, as well as the bearings making the ""buzz-saw"" sound until it heats up. I'm glad I saw this review since I have not been able to find any information about this shadow issue. I had no idea it was due to parts being glued in the hottest part of the device! Yikes! It gets great picture and has been a really good projector for our home theater until this issue. I won't buy another Infocus item because of the service issues and the BBB rating of the company. But it was a great intro home theater projector for the price at the time. Saved us 2 years worth of movie tickets at least. Steer clear of this brand if you want to get more than 2 years of average use out of it."
2,"Good picture, short bulb life","This projector provides a good, bright, clear picture. But I've had two bulbs blow out after only about 300-400 hours each. That's about $1 an hour! For this reason, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,SHORT BULB LIFE,"I've had the X2 for roughly 14 months. The X2 was used for watching movies (about once every 2 weeks) and big sports event (NCAA/NFL finals.. etc). The unit worked up to about 1200 hrs, then the lamp blew. I was hoping to get to at least 1500 hrs before the lamp went out.Good picture quality for the price (799) but short lamp life (get extended warranty). Check other units first."
3,all good except can't connect to laptop,"Very good image quality from DVD player, lots of good functions.But can't connect to my laptop. Though I tried to use (VGA to DVI to M1) adapter and cables, eventually failed.So, returned it.As my laptop does not have DVI port. I did not test whether DVI to M1 can get it work.The S-video connection from laptop to projector works, but terrible image quality."
4,I LOVE MY CANONFB62OU SCANNER,"THIS LITTLE THING WORKS REALLY WELL. THE SOFTWARE LOADED FINE & IS SIMPLE TO USE. I USE THE SCANNER AS A ""COLOR PRINTER"", A SCANNER, & TO SEND EMAIL OF MY COLOR PHOTOS FROM MY 35MM SLR. I HAVE USED IT FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS, & I LOVE IT. YOU CAN'T BEAT IT'S SIZE, PRICE, OR PERFORMANCE!"
1,Horrible graphics,"This scanner has horrible graphics! Oncey ou scan something, take it off the scanner, and hold it next to the picture of it on your monitor. They look nothing alike! The picture of it on the monitor looks terrible!! I would not buy it!"
1,You get what you pay for.,"The one day my scanner worked, they all contained a dark background that could not be corrected even with additional software without distorting the picture, even text had a dark background. The second day, no power. I spent 4 separate days holding, at my expense for tech support, but no one picked up. I sent an email that took 3 weeks to answer which said call tech support."
3,Parallel is better,Its a good scanner but with darker shades. A parallel port scanner from canon is a better one than this one.
5,Excellent first scanner,"Easy hookup to my PC-Pentium II processor. Easy setup, except for several attempts to complete the registration via modem--finally skipped through that and did the registration online. After that, I was quickly on my way, scanning my first photo in minutes. I felt it did a great job. I emailed my photos and response from my friends on the quality were very positive. Excellent choice for first-time scanner purchasers.Only downside is there is no on/off switch. Overall I'm very satisfied with this scanner."
1,Wrong adapter,"The adapter pictured is not the adapter in the title. The adapter pictured is what the company shipped, but both ends are DVI-D."
3,Boooooring,"I've played guitar for twenty years and am certainly impressed by Hunter's technique and vision. I've seen him live with various bands and solo, and he is a genius at what he does. That said, this is sooo boring! Very little groove, very little melody, mostly just look what I can do on my neat invention!Technique and weird arrangements are not necessarily good music. I love guitar playing and git-oriented music a lot, but this was very hard to sit through, and it's less than an hour. He's waaay better with Garage A Trois or his other projects, and I'm sure he has lots of groovy solo pieces that wail along. But they ain't here!For fans and completists only.Much better to see Hunter live, or check out Shango or other group stuff.Love him when he's funky, but that don't happen much here."
4,First Rate Music,"I happened to come across this CD at an annex and decided to buy and listening to it. Didn't want to turn it off. Listened to it from beginning to end and LOVED it. A lot of rareties in here. I even bought the music for Navarra when I was in Spain.Highly recommend it. Both Costa and Pizarro have a wonderful sound. Unfortunately, I heard this CD is out of print. A pity, since it offers rare spanish gems to the 2-piano artists of the world."
3,ANOTHER MISSING SONG?! help?!,"Someone mentioned a song missing - that was played at the funeral.There is another song not on this CD/Tape -- hoping someone could help me. The song is played at the family BBQ/Cookout....when Stella & Winston return from Jamaica....they're dancing, the family is dancing and Stella's Ex is sitting talking to Winston about her...it's a 70's/early 80's sounding funk/R&B;/Dance song....HELP?!! Artist/Song title???I'm desperate! LOL It's driving me nuts!"
3,Pretty Good,"After hearing the ""Waiting to Exhale"" soundtrack, I was eager to listen to the music on the ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" soundtrack. However, I was a little disappointed. The two best tracks on this CD are ""Beautiful"" sung by Mary J. Blige and ""Your Home Is In My Heart (Stella's Love Theme)"" sung by Boyz II Men and Chante Moore. I wish more songs like these could have been on the CD, but the songs that were there did their job with setting the tone for love in a tropical getaway."
4,Sountrack Disappointment,I must admit that the movie was good but the song sung at the Funeral Service was the best song and it wasn't on the Soundtrack CD. Up to now I only received the name of the song from the lady who wrote a review frm St.Louis Missouri USA. I tried to find it also but I have been disappointed everytime. Why was it omitted from the CD? Anyways I assume they are regretful about it. Thanks Lady from Missouri USA for assisting me with that song since i did not even see it in the credits.........I will continue looking and I don't think Oleta Adams sings it I checked...
3,MUSIC TO PUT YOU IN A JAMAICA STATE OF MIND,"The movie was very entertaining , Whoopi was supreme in it , the CD from the movie was a little sumthin'sumthin', enough to make you think warm weather , tropical beaches with white sand and a few Winston Shakespeares hanging about . It wasn't a hot CD packed with tunes to get you movin'and groovin' , some of the songs on it did nothing for me , but I particularly liked Luv Me Luv Me , Beautiful, Free Again and The Art Of Seduction . If you want a little island escapism in the form of music , this CD would be what you're looking for ."
4,A Phenomenal Compilation of Artists,"I was very satisfied with this particular soundtrack. I am a soundtrack junky and it is very rare to find one which grabs you from the intro and doesn't allow you to move until the last track is played. With artists like Shaggy, Janet, Boyz II Men, Wyclef, Stevie Wonder, etc. how could this be anything but a phenomenal compilation of artists! A must have .. nothing as entrancing since Love Jones!!!"
2,Not Worth It,The song from the funeral is not on the album. I have searched for it for years. It is sung by Oleta Adams. I contacted her management company to find out how to get this song. I did get a response back that this song was not released. It was only :30 seconds of music that was recorded and they asked Oleta to sing on it. I think we need to start a writing/email campaign to FlyteTyme Productions and have them release this song. It is so beautiful and should not have been left out. Obviously it's a classic since folks are still talking about it 5 YEARS LATER.
4,Need the name of a song,Does anyone know the name of the song that is on when Stella visits Whoopie Goldbergs character in the hospital and they dance?
3,"If not here, then where?","Since my favorite song, ""Love Never Forgets"" ( sung by Oleta Adams during the funeral scene) was blatantly left off this CD, all I really want to know is where to find it. It doesn't appear on any of Ms. Adam's CD's either. Does anyone know?"
2,UNBELIEVABLE!,"I loved the movie and that includes the music. However, my favorite song and by far the best song from the movie isn't even on the CD. What were they thinking when they left off Oleta Adams and Brenda Russell! UNBELIEVABLE"
4,Tropical Paradise,"Well if your like me who enjoys the actual music from the movie, you will love this CD. When I listen to the songs, it's not so much for the music as it is the memory of the part of the movie it relates to and me wishing I was actually a part of it. I enjoyed almost all of the songs but they do all remind me of some seductive parts to the movie that I thought was wonderfully made."
3,Galco SOB Holster,"Good, but a little stiff. May be better once it's broken in and softened up. and Just a little uncomfortable."
4,I love my new clock.,This is a classic look which fits in anywhere ... looks rich and does not disappoint. Easy to read from a distance and the wood grain is lovely.
5,Pinball Dreams,"Absolutlely fascinating documentary about the Pinball 2000 Williams pinball machine. By no means essential that you are 'into' pinball to enjoy it either. Interviews are well cut with footage and images.Of special note are the excellent production values throughout - I was really expecting something far less polished than this. The 2DVD set is packed with extras too. Apparently 6hours of 'em! I am yet to watch them all, but the 60 minute feature itself is worth the price of the DVD - so why wait?Incidentally I'd also suggest 'Once Upon Atari' (Howard Scott Warshaw's documentary) if independent films about old electronic games companies are your thing - equally fascinating but much more homemade looking."
5,Great Collection,"I rate this collection five stars because every single song on here is a gem. I would rate it 6 stars except that 2 songs are edited. Part 1 of Suzie-Q is here but not part 2 and I Heard It Through the Grapevine fades out way before its 11 minute runtime. Still, what's here is good. Every album cut (non-single selection) is outstanding. It's as if the compiler knew which songs would please any CCR fan and they are all here. Of course, die-hard fans will want all the original albums, but this collection comes as close as you can to owning all the best without buying every other release. And besides, you have to buy Cosmo's Factory because it is such a great album and that way you will get all 11 minutes of I Heard It Through the Grapevine."
2,Good information but the recipes could be better,"I bought this book for my daughter who already has cooking experience. I liked the idea that it talked about various health issues and then provided an activity and recipes relating to the topic. I had high hopes for this book but it fell a little flat. Often, there is not a clear connection made between the topic and the recipes. Also, we have had terrible luck with the recipes. I think they could work but they need to be experimented with. This is not something I think you should have to do when the book is geared towards children. I want my daughter to be able to follow the recipe and get the desired results. This has not been possible with the recipes in this book."
2,Roller Rush,"Roller Rush is a fun game, I must admit. But the only problem is that unless you get the to the Masters score or perfect score and get three stars, which you need to obtain and buy items, you will be playing this game forever. When you reach just the basic level you only get one star and you only allow to get anywhere from one to three stars per round. Nice game but this game is no where compared to Diner Dash. Diner Dash came out with two other games after the first one because of its success. This game, Roller Rush was not a success, that is why MSN Games is offering it for $9.99 and not $19.99 like all the other games. This gameis worth playing on MSN because you are able to play as long as you do not go out of the game, Try this first before purchasing this game.Roller Rush WHAT????"
4,Good fun for $9.99,"This is a fun game, but the graphics aren't as good as Diner Dash and there's no story behind it, which I personally miss. You just rush around on your roller skates serving various customers, trying to earn enough money to move on to the next round. It does get pretty hard, but you can replay and replay a level until you get a perfect score. It's addicting and fun for what it is, but I much preferred Diner Dash 3(though I won't be spending $20 on it)."
3,"Fun, but repetitve","I love the Diner Dash and Cake Mania games, so I figured that I would love this one as well. It is a good game, but I found it to be slightly more repetitive and boring than the others. It is a good game if you have nothing better to do."
3,"OK, but Not Great","It is my second color printer and it is nice. It just hogs the ink. Otherwise, I enjoy it. Besides a few bugs that interfere with Windows Media Player and other applications, not a bad product.Just Don't use it when you computer is on a Y2K day like DEC 31,1999. It will NOT WORK!"
1,Mulch + Potting Soil = Miracle Grow Organic Potting Soil :(,"I purchase LOTS of potting soil. Miracle grow's standard potting soil is a really nice product. I was at the supermarket and just needed a little potting soil this time. Normally I buy 3 or 4 of the biggest Costco sized bags but this time I just go a normal sized organic bag. This is not good potting soil. It has a really high percentage of shredded wood in it. Wood eats nitrogen from the soil as it composts to become soil. This potting soil will sacrifice my plants while it transforms into GARDEN SOIL (too much compost and not light enough to be potting soil even after all the wood degrades). Stay away from this soil and go for the regular potting soil or if you want actually ""natural"" potting soil you can blend your own."
1,"Terrible pH, little perilite","Terrible soil mix. Comes with hardly any perilite in the mix. pH runoff with this using 6.5 water was over 8 almost 9, and causes plants to have nute deficiency issues due to the high pH unless you do a flush with pH corrected water and verify that the runoff isn't completely off the charts.Save yourself time and get yourself a real soil mix like fox farm or something instead of buying this crap."
1,Bugs Bugs Bugs!!!!!,"I bought this stuff at our local garden center at first. Bugs EVERYWHERE! Yuck. You won't see them at first, but as soon as you start using it...and adding water (as you need to do to keep the greenies alive) you'll be infested with tiny gnat-like things that come out of the soil. Tried buying at a different location - SAME PROBLEM! I love the idea of an organic soil. But if that includes infestation of bugs in the house, it's a terrible idea! It seems others are having the same issue - perhaps they can fix this problem someday. What a waste of money, though. I'm disappointed I bought it. I suppose if you used it for ONLY outside containers it might not be an issue since there are bugs outside anyway."
1,Disaster. Do not purchase,Bug infested!!! Had to fumigate my office afterwards. Would give zero if possible.
1,Disappointed.,"I don't mind the bugs in the soil. They are usually found in soil and have been in the other soils I have purchased. The lady bugs and other insects in my garden usually enjoy having them for lunch. However, unlike the other soils where my plants thrived, this soil did not produce any results to speak of. The plants I tried to grow in this soil...didn't. And it isn't like I planted them yesterday. I purchased this soil about 6 months ago and nothing planted in it ever grew. I have long since gone back to other soils. Hopefully, you have better luck."
3,"'Unknown Deutschland -The Krautrock Archive,Volume 3' - Various Artists (Virgin Import)","Not as outstanding as the 'Unknown Deutschland,Volume 1'(see my review),but still a decent pick.Need to keep in mind these are extremely little-known sub-underground Krautrock bands that originally had released their lp's in a limited quantity of fifty each around 1974-76.Most of these bands reportedly never even got out of the garage let alone signed.So,now we're able to fully experience these otherwise unavailable recordings.About half the artists on this disc have one full length disc available out there.Best tracks here are Golem's ""Stellar Launch"",the lengthy Galactic Explorer's ""Ethereal Jazz"" and Chrono's ""Schaudernacht"",which is okay.If it sounds like something you might enjoy,I encourage you to get a copy."
3,"good nostalgia, good animation","Be warned, this particular release is not compatible with Windows XP. (But you can still view the video files if you have a media player.)This is good nostalgia for anyone who remembers being wowed by the animation and soundtrack when Dragon's Lair and Space Ace appeared in arcades in the mid 1980s. The gameplay is very simplistic, with a lot of trial and error needed."
2,Not easy to use.,"This eyelash curler looks good, but the design makes it difficult to see exactly where to place them on the eyelashes to curl them. I gave up trying!"
2,Beware defective discs and damaged packaging.,"About a year ago, I ordered this set at least twice, maybe three times, from independent sellers and once from Amazon. Every time except once the plastic cases for the DVD's were completely crushed in shipping. Also, the Blue Velvet disc vibrates horribly and very nearly ruined my DVD player.The Blue Velvet error happened with ALL copies of the set I purchased, even replicating on computers and other DVD players owned by my friends.I contacted ABSURDA who acted shocked that this happened. I sent the disc to them and they sent me a replacement disc that was STILL defective.BEWARE."
2,no good for keys,"I don't know what these rings are for, but you don't want to try to put keys on them. When opened enough to work over the hole in a key (ie 3-4 mm), they end up sprung -- the layers don't spring back together but stay ~1 mm apart. I should have waited for local my hardware store to get the small rings back in stock ..."
1,klein' s sesame almonds,"i thought they were as good as the traders joe almonds, but because of the free shipping i ordered, but when i tasted them , they were a little over bake for me. then, they only have little sesame, i will not buy this product again"
3,Cartridge starts printing mostly red after a while,"After a while the cartridge prints red, and I thought I needed another one. After running a cleaning program twice the printing returned to normal."
1,Very Disapointed in the Lexmark Color Ink Cartridge,"After I ordered, the Lexmark Color ink cartridge 13619HC in October, it was graciously replaced because the only color that printed was pink. Last week-end I decided to use the replaced cartridge, much to my dismay it had leaked black ink inside the foil wrapper. After cleaning off the ink, I inserted it and tested it. The test page was light gray--no color what so ever. I am wondering if all these ink cartridges are defective. I am NOT happy with this product!!Thank you.Veva Adamson"
3,gripping and well acted.,When i first saw this film i could not belive that Drew Barrymore was capable of true acting talent. Most of the films she has done to this day are about aldolescent subjects. Here she plays with more conviction being an abused girl who falls for the wrong guy and end up on the wrong side of the law. Some tense moments and overall a well done film.
3,"Drago real person to watch in ""Guncrazy""","Character actor Billy Drago (Delta Force II , In Self Defence) keeps this girl-meets-boy-who-loves-guns tale afloat. Though not cast as a bad guy as his roles in movies usually call for, he brings this special talent to his screen persona. And it's perfect for him. He plays the minister of a snake-handling religious group. He's done cult/religious leaders before (Never Say Die) with Frank Zagarino and Robin Smith (Solar Force). He's always been able to create a twisted charismatic leader or powerful, sadistic villain. If for nothing else this movie is worth watching just to see him do what he does best. Worth a look."
2,A fair rainy day movie...,(Purchase) or watch only on a rainy day.Drew Barrymore fans will enjoy her performance. Joe Dallesandro should have stayed home.
2,"Good action scenes, canned dramatics","Drew Barrymore exudes sexy tomboy charisma here playing small towner who finds jailbait love with an ex-con trying to straighten out his life. The movie kicks into high gear about mid-way through, once the pair gets into hot water. Until then it's rather clumsy, unfocused and slow. A long bit with an overaged Ione Skye doesn't work, and the rural atmosphere is cluttered with too many eccentrics."
3,good little movie,"This is a gem of a movie with a great performance from Drew Barrymore. It was another one of her comeback movies, filmed after ""Poison Ivy"". The story revolves around a teenager ( Barrymore ) who has been abused all her life. She becomes pen pals with a convict ( James LeGros ), who is guncrazed. To impress him she takes up shooting guns. With this new found power in her hands she shoots one of her abusers. When LeGros finally gets out, they bury the body and wind up killing two more people. They are then on the run from the cops. A must see for any Drew fan."
3,Not Quite Trash Classic,"So what is this movie? A film noir homage(a la ""Gun Crazy"")? A Bonnie and Clyde homage? A Lifetime movie-of-the-week? Or is it just plain trash that falls just short of classic status. Drew Barrymore and James LeGros earnestly play the trailer park trash nymphette and her prison pen pal turned partner in crime, respectively. The movie engages your attention throughout. What it lacks are those over-the-top moments that a movie like this needs to attain that midnight movie trash classic status. There is some interesting casting here. Billy Drago (he played Frank Nitti in ""The Untouchables"") as the trailer-park preacher. Tracey Walter, veteran of Jonathan Demme films, appears here as a barroom patron. Joe D'Allesandro, veteran of Andy Warhol films and the Sonny Steelgrave segment of TV's ""Wiseguy"", appears as Barrymore's mother's boyfriend."
3,Guncrazy,"Nice film from one of Drew Barrymore's earlier works. On a scale of 1-10 on rewatchability, I would give it a 5."
3,Straw hat and cane? Must be Chevalier!,"All these glowing reviews made me wonder if people even read the captions that went along with the photos!You did, you say? Well kindly explain to me the caption under the full-page photo for the 1959 Oscars. You know, the one with the singer in a tux wearing a straw hat and holding a cane? Yes, the one with the caption ""Maurice Chevalier, the French cafe and music hall crooner whom Paramount had signed in the Roaring Twenties...""Hmm. That's a mighty young man to have been signed in the 1920s, you think to yourself...Maybe because it's actually a full page photo of singer Tony Martin!I expect the editors of Vanity Fair to have the professionalism to at least caption their photos accurately. That's part of the job of running a magazine, isn't it? *sigh*Oh, well. Hopefully, Tony Martin (who passed away this year) managed to see this photo and have a good laugh. Wouldn't we all love find our mug in a book commemorating the Oscars!"
1,Oscar Night 75 Years of Parties,I have NOT received this item yet!! I can not believe the POOR shipping system of Amazon!!
1,I wanted to give it zero stars...,"He can't write (it's a miserable read), and the book contains few (if any) recipes per se. Turn down a free book."
3,This was not what I expected,"The photography in this book is great. Some of the tips are very good, but I also found some of the instructions to be outdated. There are a few nice projects. Since this is my first time making any kind of candle, I feel this book is for a more experience crafter."
5,Begin Programming in a Finite Amount of Time and Effort,"This book is not a tutorial on C++, nor is it a book on data structures, as the market is full of such work. The main focus of this book is to introduce a four-step programming model that has helped me finished each and every program in a finite amount of time and effort, hence the title ""Finite Programming in C++"". The book has many well-thought-out programming exercises to illustrate how to use this model to program efficiently. Any programmer will likely, if not definitely, benefit from reading this book. If you are the kind of programmer who has trouble having your programming assignments done on time, this book is a must read. If you never have problems having your programs done and you are concerned more with efficiency issues of a program, then move on. There are plenty of such books on the market. Happy programming~"
5,Finite Programming in C++,"First of all I agree with the book that one should approach programming in a systematic way instead of brute force it. I like its four step programming model, but I am not sure it is fully developed. Many points the book brings up are excellent and well thought out, but some of them I don't quite agree with. I guess part of the reason is that they are subject to debate and there's no true answer to them.By the way, the book mentions one tip that has truly saved me a bunch of time and effort. That I got to hand it to you. If it weren't for it I wouldn't have known it.Overall, this book is a valuable resources for all programmers interested in studying C++."
5,One of the best albums of the year!,"Synthetic 16 brings a brand of rock & roll that the industry is lacking right now...""rock *AND* roll"". It's too often we are getting sorry excuses for what rock & roll should be. It's either power metal ballads (think Creed) or bands that have one song to call a hit (think 3 Doors Down). Been there, done that.With Synthetic 16, you get a tight sound of great guitars and a drummer with true power and aggression. Jon Sconadatto's vocals soar on some great songs like the lead-off track, ""Blew"" - and you really get thrown right into the passion and emotion of the lyrics countered with a great melody in songs like ""More Than This"" and ""Delicious Sunshine"". If you want to know more what this band sounds like, then think of your favorite rock band and multiply it by 10.Buy this album...one of the best music purchases I have made in quite some time."
4,Totally Spies 2,"I played this game for the 1st time tonight.I really enjoyed it and so did my 12 and 10 year old girls.There are alot of missions you must complete.The !st is rollar blading through cars,then you must use your stylus ,as you are a running pot of flowers being blown air on by a hair dryer,You must use the stylus to break up all the puffs of air from the hair dryer.The next part,you must take seeds through a leaf in the flowersw out through a mini game type maze without touching the sides or the seeds will be damaged and no good.The next part had my girls and I laughing hysterically as you must go through these mazes while talking or blowing in the microphone to keep the people you are sneaking around busy on the phone so they don't see you sneaking by.I haven't got much further but Tonight was a blast.I got the game at K=mart for $4.99 so it was well worth the money.My girls are not fans at all of the cartoon network show but love the game."
1,The real Lincoln,We all know that Lincoln was not perfect but to use unsubstantiated material to paint him black is not only a disservice to Lincoln but to the United States also.
4,Broadening one's Hillbilly Highway horizons,"Transcedental Blues was a comeback album for Steve Earle. On the verge of death from drug addiction in the mid-90's, it took Earle a few years to get back on the saddle, but once he did, he used the various mental state experiences to produce one of his most compelling albums. Purish Earle fans might find it a little experimental, but all the great artists vary their sound here and there and Steve Earle is a great artist. This album gets better with every listen."
4,Faulkner or Fitzgerald?,"Good feeling for the South and good expression of that frenetic and searching period of our history, this is the first novel of Shelby Foote's that I have read. I found it a very ""good read"" sort of novel and look forward to the next one - comng soon in the mail."
4,A solid story with strong characters,"Shelby Foote brought Ken Burns's documentary ""The Civil War"" to life with his rhythmic, honey-voiced narration; and his prose in ""Love in a Dry Season"" is the written extension of it. As I read it, I felt as if the author were sitting next to me on the veranda in a comfortable rocker on a warm summer evening relaying the story in his soft, Mississippi delta drawl. The Barcroft family, the Carruthers family, and the scoundrel Harley Drew all stepped off the page and came to life. There are no two dimensional, cardboard characters here.Quite simply, it is a good story which is well told. The influence of William Faulkner is apparent but not overwhelming. For the reader who enjoys the varying degrees of personalty light and shadow which comes with well designed literary characters ""Love in a Dry Season"" is a success. The story flows logically and is put together like a well-designed building where each element has a purpose with no superfluous parts."
2,Urinary Flow Product,"Did not work for me because of side effects. Felt dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous and just plain awful. Will not buy this again."
4,A great starting point for those interested in Data Mining,"This is a well written and interesting book on a complex topic. I especially appreciated the first four chapters, which provide a good overview of estimation and classification, and chapters 10 through 12 which describe the main algorithms, training and testing and troubleshooting."
1,No so good for digital,"This filter is interesting in concept. Overall it has a warming effect, but it is not exactly a warming filter. What is does is, it allows all reds and oranges through. Most greens and blues come through, not so much yellow.As a result, reds tend to be stronger and more pure. I once pointed it at a somewhat dirty red stop sign and it actually looked a bit cleaner.The problem with this filter is that it is very hit and miss (mostly) miss with most subjects. I tooks a photo of a asphalt street and it came out pink. In fact most whites come out a little pink. When you combine this with a digital camera's white balance system, consistant results are difficult to get.Photoshop has more options for color correcting than a single filter ever could. Both time and money are better spent on that"
5,Insightful look at life in Central America,"This book will charm your heart and open your eyes to life, love, and pain in Nicaragua. Written by an anthropologist who was an intimate member of a small, middle class community in Managua, his stories are full of emotion, power, and a definite ring of truth. If you want to learn more about Nicaraguan culture and life from a verifiable source, this book is for you. A must-read for any traveler or potential immigrant to the region."
3,relaxing,I heard this selection for the first time while having a facial and enjoyed it very much. I do enjoy French music and this brings back happy memories of my travels there. I was so happy to find it available on Amazon.com.
3,More easy listening than Jazz,"It's always a risk buying a CD when you can't listen to samples of the numbers. I this case I bought it anyway, hoping to find a French speaking jazz singer comparable to Julie London, Patricia Barber, Ruth Cameron, or Diana Krall, supported by a good jazz combo. If that's what you're looking for , this CD isn't it. While Liane Foly has a good voice and sings some of the songs really well, the arrangements here are over produced, with everything from background choruses, to disco era percussion beats, and even strings, thrown together. To me, it seemed more reminiscent of a 1980's era easy listening radio station collection, than a good jazz club performance."
2,Neptune is better than this,"I have seen John Kaizan Neptune in concert and this recording is below his standards. He can swing with jazz, even better than in his CD ""JazZen"", and he perform classical shakuhachi works with flare, hinted at in his duet with koto in the CD ""Prime Numbers"". Unfortunately, he can also plunge into banal, New Age improvisations also. ""Asian Roots"" is light weight. More interesting percussion may be found with Yas-Kaz's works of the 1980s. I suggest you pass on this recording and explore many of Neptune's other works."
3,dangerous babes,this is fair movie i mean it is not great it the kind of movies you see in drive- in cause the indoor theater would not touch it all and all it is ok but dont look for great
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD SET!!!!!!!,THE SET CONSIST OF THREE DVD'S THAT ARE NOT MOUNTED ON SPINDLES BUT SIMPLY THROWN INTO CHEAP PAPER ENVELOPES. MINE WERE SO COMPLETELY SCRATCHED THAT I IMMEDIATLEY RETURNED THE SET AND DEMANDED A REFUND. DO NOT PATRONIZE MILL CREEK FOR THEIR INFERIOR PRODUCTS. THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL EVER GET THE MESSAGE IS IF WE CONSUMERS STAND TOGETHER AND REFUSE TO BUY THEIR GARBAGE!
4,Slamwich ROCKS!,"We played this at my son's friend's house and we had the best time! I came home and went straight to Amazon to order one that we could play at our house! It comes packaged in a cute metal case that looks like a lunchbox. The cards are durable and very colorful and fun to look at. They are shaped like slices of bread and there is a different kind of sandwich filling on each.What I really enjoyed about this game is that my five-year-old was able to play it with no problem, but it was also fun for the older kids and adults to play at the same time. I find with games that it's often difficult to find something that everyone both enjoys playing and is able to play. Slamwich hit the mark there!I think that everyone of all ages should own Slamwich!"
2,Not for 5-year olds,"I bought this game for my 5-year old as she had outgrown the Candyland-type little kids games. This one will have to be saved until she is a little older. It was hard for her to keep track of the rules, what to yell when, when to slam the cards, etc. It's on the shelf for now."
5,Fantastic Fun!!! Fast with mind and hands.,"This is a GREAT game!!! My daughter is 6, and it is a little hard to make some of the pairs when the pace is fast, but we had so much fun playing this card game. Great educational value too. Teachs pattern recognition, agility, multi-tasking and more. Highly recommend this!!!"
3,Poorly written...,"It was slow going as the writing is dreadful - I really had to persevere. Luckily, I got this book from the library; I would have been annoyed had it been a purchase."
2,Watch Out,watch out for false starements in this book. many good pics except for the one ... that doesn't even look like lucy. so beware if you love lucy watch what you believe--Steph
4,Book: Holy Infant of Prague,"This book is very informative and for me, a little more indepth with the background of historal wars, queens etc. thanI really wanted..I just wanted to know the particulars of the Infant himself. The pictures are beautiful but I would have liked more of laymen information on just the wee Infant and His discovery.."
2,Heart of Christmas 1992 # 3,"color on outside not ""red"" but darker maroon, doesn't match rest of collection of them.Packaging good Arrived timely . Inside of ornament good."
5,Life-affirming,"I can see why this film won so many awards when it came out in 1976. It is beautifully acted by all the principal players, has some fine photography and at its core is the theme of the stultifying atmosphere of a Roman Catholic school for boys destined for the priesthood. But the hormone-laden youngsters fight a losing battle, and while some manage to suppress and progress down the path of righteousness, others fail and sin. It is a wonderful film thoroughly worth watching, unless you are looking for sexual titillation in which case you will be disappointed, as the subject is treated tastefully with subtlety and finesse."
5,You get a lot of book for your money,"This isn't just a book for ad students and insiders, though I imagine they'd love it. I'm not an ad junkie myself, but I happen to love this book because it's a very different and interesting coffee table book, that you can spend hours looking at. The ads featured in the book are amazing - funny, clever, intriguing, sometimes works of art in themselves. And the captions explain what's going on, all that sly thinking and logic behind the ads. I find it's the kind of book that really gets people talking. But be forewarned - it's a huge book, so make sure you have a strong coffee table!"
5,Welcome Relief for Our National Angst,"For the last few years, I've been doing research for a book addressed to otherwise healthy people who feel traumatized by the news--that is, people suffering political depression. So I was elated to find not only confirmation of this phenomenon in Harriet Lerner's wonderful book, but also genuinely helpful advice on dealing with it. When a whole culture is distressed, she writes, ""it will develop an anxiety disorder all its own."" Certainly, newspapers today offer plentiful evidence of national angst. Every sentence in Fear and Other Uninvited Guests resonated...and relieved. Individually and collectively, life is a process, pain is a teacher. I guess it's not merely coincidence that Harriet's last name is Lerner. Reading her, I felt like one too."
1,ridiculous book!,"This book is terrible! The suggestions for what to feed a 4-7 month old baby are crazy. At the beginning of numerous recipes it suggests frying and onion, potatos, etc.! Why on earth would you fry anything for a 4 month old baby?!It also suggests cheddar cheese, and strawberries for babies under one year old. I am suprised the book doesn't mention sprinkling peanuts as a garnish on top of the fried onion, cheddar and strawberries. A basic understanding of babies and nutrition should be necessary if you are going to write a cook book for babies."
3,Some delicious dishes for OLDER BABIES,"I've enjoyed making many of the dishes in this book--a highlight: the delicious Pumpkin Stew, which my one-year-old gobbles up and I like too--but the recipes are not appropriate for new eaters. A 4-month-old shouldn't be eating complex foods liked mixed vegetables sauteed with onion in olive oil. Like other reviewers, I suggest this book as a complement to other resources."
2,"Get Real, Lady!!","Before I actually had my son, I read this and thought it was the greatest book ever written. I had visions of creating a varied, organic menu everyday. I also envisioned my son and I signing to eachother, that is when we weren't practicing our flashcards or reciting Shakespeare in Spanish.Don't get me wrong, I'm all for eating good food, and I try to expose my son to as many stimulating activities as I can when I'm not doing laundry or vacuuming cheerios out from under the couch. But are you really suggesting I prepare my toddler lamb? Fishcakes? Get real, lady!!"
2,Too mature for infants,"Although the cookbook promotes healthy eating for babies/toddlers, the recipes seem to be a bit much for an infant 4-9 months old. The ingredients seem to be too mature for an infant starting solids. I was looking for a cookbook to make simple homemade healthy food to start with, there are not many options for that in this cookbook."
1,Huge disapppointment,"I have a toddler at home. Everything that I have for him to eat is getting very borring, he has been eating it for a while now. So I decided to expand his menu a little. This book was not very usefull at all. I do not give him meats or poutry yet. All that this book had for toddleres was not healthy recipies. This was a waste of money."
1,"Fair recipes, Horrible advice","The recipes are good recipes in themselves, but the advice that Lizzie Vann gives in regards to WHEN to feed certain foods (i.e. a recipe with cheddar cheese in it in the 4-7 month chapter) and her apparent attitude towards breastmilk are both HORRID.Many of the recipes in the 4-7 month chapter are not appropriate for a child under 1 year of age!Her recommendations on foods are contrary to much of the advice given by the AAP - i.e. she recommends cheese between 4-7 months while the APP recommends no dairy products before 9 months, she recommends strawberries between 8-10 months while the APP recommends no strawberries before 1 year.Her advice regarding switching to formula a few weeks before going back to work is heinous. While that is certainly a valid option, the option of expressing breastmilk while at work should have also been presented in equal light.I am so dissapointed in this book, that I am returning it."
4,Great recipes!,"First let me say that there are MANY great sections on nutrition and how to feed your baby/toddler well with wonderful organic foods. Also, the recipes are excellent and my son has enjoyed almost all of the dishes I have made from this book. In some cases the portion sizes and methods are a bit impractical, but she includes prep/cook times and serving suggestions.The first recipe I decided to make for my son was a pasta dish (I bought this book when he was over a year old), and when I looked at the ingredients I realized it was for a SINGLE serving (for a 10 month old). So,I have just decided to make larger portions and freeze some of the leftovers."
3,good cookbook,"It's a good cookbook for the cook looking to get a little more creative or looking for new ideas for babies/toddlers. But organic? It's no different. You could use any baby cookbook & just use organic ingredients in place of conventional. But that's how it's going to be for any cookbook that boasts ""organic"" in the title. It's a bit of a marketing sham if you ask me. But I do enjoy the cookbook. My two year old liked helping me make the fruit bread sticks & she really loved eating them! Very healthy. I strongly agree with some of the other reviews however that you should not use this cookbook as a guide to know when to feed your baby what foods. Food allergies are scary things and a 4 month old should not be eating dairy."
3,Some great recipes,"This is a fairly good cookbook. It groups the recipes by age of the baby/toddler/pre-schooler, and has some good ideas for creative snacks. My favorite recipe is the Dahl. It's basically lentils with vegetables; it's very easy and my pre-schooler actually loves it. We top it with plain yogurt and he devours it."
3,A good book about Black deaf culture within a deaf subculture,"This book offers a good introduction about the African American deaf community that exists as a miniority within a Deaf minority in America. If you are looking for a overview of the Deaf Culture then this is a good foundation book. The only downside about the book is that some of the chapers seem to be a mirror of previous chapters only about a different geographical Deaf community. However, given the limited number of resources about Deaf culture it is definitely worth reading."
3,pointed metal screws,"instead of bolt and nut with lock washers, the item comes with the pointed screws. this will only tear off the hole once the rope cleat is accidentally pulled off."
3,Hmmm.,"The guys did it again. I'm a big fan of their first album. Guys are great musicians and songs are pure wild rockabilly. This album? I don't know what to say. First time I heard it I was little dissapointed. They lost the edge of the first one. It's something different. The sound is much softer. Though you can find some good songs like...Barney Knows, or a country tune If My Heart Could Speak or It All Depends On You for example."
5,Inspiring book and a great read!,"This book is an inspring look at how a courages young adult stood up to this disease and looked it straight in the eye. Rather than let CF beat him, he is beating it. I dont know what it is like to have CF, but the Author's description of his own life inspire me to stand up against my own minor problems and face them head on. I read the book on one long delayed flight and I finished it in one sitting. I highly recommend this book for anyone, CFer or not!"
3,Inspriationally Dull,"I'll be honest, all in all I liked reading about Andy's journey with CF. I can understand how he feels and he does a good job of describing what he has been through. While reading i felt as though half of this book was written to help you understand andy and his journey and the other half is simply a ""look what i did."" At times he came off as whiny and emotional. Also although it's never metioned it's written as though andy grew up with ""deep pockets."" Which is fine, it just helps me understand him. Overall i feel for you Andy. Fight the good fight"
5,"Spectacular, motivational, touching","Whether or not your life has been touched by chronic disease, you will be able to relate to Lipman's story of overcoming adversity. The candid, honest prose reminds the reader to seize the day. The work has affected me more than any other. I would highly recommend it."
3,Not as good as others by this author,"Way down deep in the deep blue sea, is by far the best teaching kids book I have ever come across......this book is just not as catchy or fun and the animals are not ones I would choose to teach since kids will not ever come across them. I def. recommend the other book but not this one."
4,Nice gift idea,Good for a young artist or just to know you are giving a unique gift if you don't know what to buy for a child. The design is good for both girls and boys and the price is nice.
5,Good paint by numbers kit,"My wife loved this kit. The canvas used is very nice and durable, the paints work perfectly as well. Required a little mixing of paints."
4,Good printer for the price,"If you really want a printer that just prints great looking cards or calendars, this is the printer to use. Of course, if you plan on using it for every day office use, this isn't the printer for you. Good quality looking pictures and speed is adequate. I would recommend this printer for simple home use."
3,No Power On/Off Switch,There is no power ON/OFF switch. It is extremely inconvenient. You have to either leave the printer on all the time or you have to plug and unplug it every time you use it.
2,Save your money! Please.,"Within a few months after purchase printer head died. Thought I was just unlucky, forked out a cool [$$$] for a new printer head(my second bad move). Printer head this time lasted about a year and a half with minimal use. Consumption of ink is excessive and therefore costly.The number of bad reviews for this printer sums it all.Just because it says its a ""canon"" do not be fooled.Buyer beware!"
2,Overrated!,"This machine quit operating after 10 months from the day I opened the box.I used it for about a total of 40 minutes within this time frame. I replaced the cartridges, even deleted it`s software program and downloaded again to be sure I had not made an error. Yes, I made certain that `pause` was not on.I noticed another person had this same complaint, it`s true, this product appears unreliable.I do consider Canon products to be very good overall, but they need to re-engineer this printer.Thanks anyway."
1,Warning - Stops Working,"Built-in obsolescence might be Canon's watchword with this printer. One year ago I purchased this for home use. Seemed great with sharp photo & text quality. Worked so well that I purchased a second for our small office and recommended a friend buy it a few months later. Within six months it refused to acknowledge ink in the cartridges - after buying three new cartridges. Canon's tech support was essentially useless, although he did admit it was a problem that had come up before.So, my printer is useless, the one for our office did the same thing two months later, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that my friend doesn't show up at my door with another broken printer."
2,Canon? Shoot it with a cannon!,"This printer is not very reliable. I had paper jams a lot, it is very sluggish in printing, slower with a color cartridge, and very (inexpensive). The software was all that saved it. It is easy to follow and too easy to install. Heck, Licoln could install the printer software and add the printer to his desktop like (snap my fingers to indicate ""instantly"") that! I would recommend better software and products that are a little higher in price, but a whole colon load better than this rubbish."
5,Great printer!,"I bought this printer on recommendation from my dad, who says that the BJC-2000 is the only model they use where he works. (It also helped that I was able to buy it about thirty dollars cheaper when it was on sale here.) Yes, the printing is a little slow, but the quality is great! I also like the fact that I can get ink cartridges for less than ten dollars (Canon brand even)! My ""other"" printer is a Compaq that came with my computer, but I about croaked when I had to replace the cartridges. Just getting one black and one color cartridge for the Compaq costs about sixty dollars!! Sheesh! At the price this model, the Canon is, it practically makes it a disposable printer. I'll be very satisfied if it lasts even ONE year... because I'd spend double the price of a new Canon BJC-2000 just for cartridges for the ""old"" printer."
3,It's a gamble!,"I absolutely love Canon products. The first 2 years with this computer was great until it just stopped printing this past month. I've done everything tech support has asked and then some and I feel that it's time to send this baby to printer heaven. It was a great buy, the cartridges are inexpensive next to the competition, and it worked fine til now. I guess mine only lived for 2 yrs. Better than what I've read in these reviews. My mother-in-law has the same model and she says that it still works fine. She's had it even longer than I have. So for what it's worth, it's definitely a gamble."
3,canon 2000 bubble jet printer,"Purchased this specifically for printing from our WebTv bought recently.We are very impressed with the quality andcolor on photgraphs printed. Of course regular copying is fine as well. While we would not use this for printing massive reports etc., we feel we will be very happy using it to print information from the Net occasionally. We like it so much that we are buying two for Xmas presents for our grown children... It fits under our WebTVbehind the doors in our entertainment wall unit. No clutter. It was very easy to hook up."
1,EXPENSIVE INK,"VERY NICE PRINTER BUT INK EATER. THE BC-21e CARTRIDGE WORKS ONLY FOR 20 PAGES, IT COST $39.00 TO REPLACE"
1,Ink Eater!,"I'm sorry, but after the 2nd time I had to replace the ink cartridge I had enough. I cannot reccomend this INK EATER!"
1,Terrible Printer and a waste of money,"This is an awful waste of money. Granted, I didn't spend much right away, but now, I am getting burned by their ink. Canon makes tiny cartridges that are almost always out of ink. On top of that, you have to buy a new print head every couple times you replace cartridges. I will never buy another Canon printer and do not wish for you to either. Buy an HP or something worthwhile."
3,Great Products! Lousy Support!,"I'm quite pleased with the quality of printing even on cheap regular paper. Also bought the IS-22 scanner cartridge to go along with the printer. Amazing scanning for a *very* low price, but there is a known software conflict with my computer (Dell). After a toll-call to customer support -- the only way to talk to an actual person is to make the toll call or wait two days for a return of e-mail -- I was told to download a fix from the Canon web-site, but there was a problem with the server on their end. Had to pay for another call to tell them that their website wasn't working...Still waiting for the fix and able to scan only in the most limited way. I'm sure everything will work eventually, and for the price, I really can't complain. But be prepared for some aggravation if you need support."
4,"For $70, this can't be beat","I've had this printer for 5 or 6 months now, and I'm very happy with it. I haven't done a lot of photo printing, but I've been happy with its color quality. I use it on draft/grayscale mode for most things. I've replaced the black tank once. The software isn't very sophisticated, though it's a good basic program for learning, and the children's Print Factory program is cute- my four year old son loves it. I'd recommend it to anyone doing household, school, or even formal work printing. Great little printer. I'd definitely buy it again."
2,Canon? Shoot it with a cannon!,"This printer is not very reliable. I had paper jams a lot, it is very sluggish in printing, slower with a color cartridge, and very cheap. The software was all that saved it. It is easy to follow and too easy to install. Heck, Licoln could install the printer software and add the printer to his desktop like (snap my fingers to indicate ""instantly"") that! I would recommend better software and products that are a little higher in price, bt a whole colon load better than this rubbish."
2,Lots of problems,"I've had lots of problems with this printer since day one. The paper often jams; the color cartidge clogged and caused the printer to stop working until I removed it; the output often smears or is misaligned. I am very disappointed. I may have a lemon, but I won't be buying a Canon product when I replace this printer."
1,Not worth it,"This printer worked great at first, but in less than a year it wore out. Now it has several gaps or spaces between the characters that make blank lines across the page, with both the color and black ink. That makes the print quality unbearable, and I've been unable to get tech support to even respond. I've replaced the print head twice at $50.00 a head hoping that's all that was wrong, but with no change. I wouldn't want to have it repaired because it would probably cost more to fix than buying a new/better printer. I can't believe they want $... for it. It's not worth it."
2,Medium quality and works for a couple of years,"I liked this printer in the begining. But it used a lot of ink and the ink was costly. Then I bought a box of cartridges from a supplier. But alas, by then the printer stopped working. I thought head was dirty but no. I guess head has worn out in two years even though my usage was very little. A box of cartridges is going waste. Then I bought a Lexmark Z13 almost at negligible price after rebates. I have heard that it doesn't have same problem. I am thinking to get a re-fill kit for it."
2,Just a Ghost of Conan...,"Unlike Loren Coleman's 1st Age of Conan trilogy, this latest start to another set of trilogies left me flat. The premise was good, but the pace and prose left much to be disired.Thus, the lack of tons of good reviews - or reviews period!Even though I didn't think Loren Coleman's trilogy was worthy of the Robert E. Howard Conan name attached to it - it stood alone on its merit. It didn't capture the essence of Conan for me, but was still a solid trilogy in its own world. Just not Howards.This one less so. Reads like it was for elementary school kids. Sorry, but if you are going to write in the realm of Conan - only rated R will do!"
3,Make sure you're getting the new edition,"The two editions appear to be tied together in Amazon's database. Reviews given to one appear in both places. In my opinion, the Second Edition (ISBN 0735539790) resolves a lot of the criticisms that I have heard and read about the first edition. Let the reviews scare you away from the old edition, but give the new one a look. It's worth it."
2,Not up to Examples & Explanations Standards!,I have all of the first year E&E books and this one is not nearly of the same quality as the rest of the series.It's confusing. There is no natural progression in explanations. I felt like I was reading another confusing casebook with bad examples!Burke and Snoe need to take a look at how Glannon does it for Torts and Civil Procedure before they write the second edition.
5,A MUST HAVE!,"Of all the property hornbooks this is the only one which will translate into a high grade on a law school exam. The Moynihan book is to small and covers only Prop 1 material. The Singer book is to voluminous, this book covers every testable subject and leaves the discussion of untestable material to the property nerds. Look no further, this hornbook is all you need to get an A in property, if you actually read it it of course."
5,Great as usual,"Buy this and High Court summaries keyed to your casebook and you're set. I also used the Gilberts and Sum and Substance 1L tapes while commuting to school--the best preparation with the least effort.Property isn't the easiest 1L subject but you get the hang of it. This book does help but it's not as easy going as Civ Pro, Ks or Torts, for instance. Still, a great help considering the subject."
4,OK to Good Hornbook,"This was my primary study aid for my property final. It did an OK job of filling in the holes in my notes and the instruction in the case book - its sections on future interests and the rule against perpetuities are actually quite good. On the downside, several sections are hopeless - for instance, the section on concurrent ownership and marital interests."
3,Not a good primer without any previous knowledge of Property,"That is not to say that this book would not receive 4 stars as a reference WHILE you are learning Property; however, I found this book confusing as an introduction without any previous knowledge of the subject. The explanations to the examples are not detailed enough and left me confused at times. Also, reading from the beginning of the book, terms and concepts are periodically thrown at you that have not previously been explained...this is from the perspective of someone who is reading this book as a primer. I can see how I will get much more out of this book once I start Property in school; but for a primer, I'd seek elsewhere."
2,"Give me a break, Harvard","Anyone who listens to that Harvard nut-job is a sap. This book is alright, not as good as Gilbert's, though. The way to go is to pick ONE book that makes sense to you and study it well. Harvey's ""forest and trees"" theory begs the question: If he falls down in a forest and there is no one there to hear his cries for help, will anyone care?"
2,not what you want,"look, the secret to law school is finding the 1 hornbook you need to survive your class. this is not it. (sorry harvard.) this is poorly written. most indications seem to be that gilbert's is much better. for what it's worth, the other things you need are: chirelstein for contracts; glannon for civ pro; there's nothing for torts, but i suppose glannon for torts is better than the rest; chemerinsky for conlaw; i don't know if there's one for criminal, but I used gilberts.this is poorly written and poorly explained. I've heard that gilbert's is better."
1,Utter Crap,"This book is garbage. Absolute garbage. I think Glannon's Civ Pro is great, and I have read many others that I can learn from. I am in chapter 8 right now, and I have been searching the internet for a way to tell the company or the authors that this book sucks. I visited the Aspen publishing webpage, but they don't give a crap, they just want to sell books. THIS BOOK IS PATHETIC. Wherever you are, Mr. Burke and Mr. Snoe, thanks a lot. 40 bucks for this crap. I just hope I can resell it to somebody who didn't read this review."
4,The evolution behind the book,I havent gotten past the evolution of how we got to this stage where its become so serious for the Fellowship .We have so many people who just dont have a clue of what the program is and what the Fellowship is .We have to know where we have been before we can deal with the present .
4,Purchased for mom,i purchased this for my mom and she was very pleased and recieved in the time stated. thanks so much.
5,Fascinating description of beginner meetings early in AA,"This is a compilation of the different methods of working with newcomers in the different AA groups around the country in early AA history, especially when the article in the Saturday Evening Post came out and they were flooded with newcomers. It can be good reading for anyone in any 12 Step program to get ideas of how to work with newcomers."
1,Back To Wally P's Cult -- a better title,"With its aggressive, antagonistic posture towards real AA meetings, its crazy promises of redemption, its ugly evangelism within AA, its cadres of Mr. Wally Paton's blank-eyed, boot-lickin' followers, I think it's safe to say that the Back To Basics movement has become a true (if cellularly organized) cult.And it's not AA. Not even close. The book offers a fundamentally selfish interpretation of AA's principles and lore. Mr. Paton has absolutely zero academic or journalistic credentials, and his much self-promoted ""research"" on the origins of AA can be, and should be, safely ignored.Dig a little deeper into the Back To Basics movement, and you'll find a scary, right-wing collection of diversity-hating nuts and bullies. As with any bullies, the only solution is to speak up and confront them."
3,"Notice the words ""Light Duty""","This item was $5.99 when I purchased. Right after, it went up to $10.99. I thought I got a bargain, but when it arrived I thought otherwise. Bottom line, these are ""Light Duty"" straps. They are probably worth what I paid, but not $10.99."
2,"Cheap, Lacks strength",I purchased these straps to use with travel luggage weighing about 50 lbs. The straps have a load limit of 30 pounds (they forgot to mention this on the product info). I can't use these and risk breaking if a baggage handler decides to pickup the luggage from the strap.
4,Underrated normality,"Don't get me wrong, I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who had a slight interest in R&B, but it's kind of more of the same. With writer Angie Stone (who wrote the stand out ""Lovely Affair"") and producer Darkchild, the UK import is definitely tuned into the American R&B scene. She has a very sweet, high voice that is interesting to hear over the deep grooves of the tracks. It reminds me of Aaliyah in a way. Worth getting."
4,Good book for the basics,I got a lot of practical advise from this book. I was able to implement some of the suggestions successfully as I read it. I recommend this book to anyone interested in starting a private practice.
3,Pool Cover,I'm not sure how good the 'solar' effects of this cover are but it does an adequate job of keeping debris out of the pool.Cleaning/drying for storage is a little difficult with the 18' diameter but if you need a pool cover it works.
2,Not what I expected,"It doesn't cling on to the sides... it's basically a huge, thick sheet of bubble wrap. Not really what I thought it was while looking at the picture, it works as long as there is no wind to lift it up."
5,I love my warm pool,"This is the 2nd Intex Solar Pool Cover we've owned. Last year we had the 12ft easy up pool and bought this cover, and this year we upgraded to the 15ft pool and so bought this bigger cover. It's still early in the season here in UT and I think this is great. My pool has been up to 86 degrees so far and we still have the whole summer to go!"
1,Piece of junk,Worst $30 ever spent. Does not heat pool at all. Just a big piece of bubble wrap. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,THE MUST UNUSEFUL COVER I NEVER SEE,"THIS COVER NOT WORK AT ALL. YOU CAN NOT FIX TO YOUR POOL, IN THE INSTRUCTIONS YOU CAN READ THAT IN WIND WEATHER YOU MUST TAKE IT OFF, WHY I CAN WANT A COVER THAT MUST BE REMOVE IN WINDY WEATHER?VERY EXPENSIVE ALSO FOR THE HALF OF THE PRICE YOU CAN BUY ONE THAT REALLY WORKS.Intex Krystal Clear 18-Foot Solar Pool Cover"
4,ITS A WARMER,We had one just this for a smaller pool. It definatly hlps warm up the water. It is kind of a pain to removee every day but that's ok.
1,wrong item,i received the wrong item not once but twice and after waiting a month i still have not received my refund
4,"""Good Cover""","This is a good solar cover for our 18ft. pool. It keeps the pollen, bugs, and leaves out and does a pretty good job of heating up the pool. I ordered the 18ft. cover but could have probably gotten away with the 15ft. as it hangs over about 2 ft. on the sides. All in all, it was a good purchase and the price was unbeatable. Thanks Amazon for another great buy."
2,"Solar cover works, but falls apart within 1 year","I just wanted to warn everyone about the Intex solar cover. I purchased one in July last year. I stored it in indoors in a dry location during the winter. When I used it this year the cover was intact, however after a couple of days of use, a major rip occurred (~ 3 feet long). Since then several other rips have occurred, making the cover useless (I am not throwing it away). The rips did not occur on a seam but in at an edge moving toward the center. In addition, something has occurred where the air pockets (all those bubble wrap looking things) have disintegrated, and I now have hundreds of blue little dots from the cover clogging the pool filter.On the positive side, the cover really does heat the water quickly. I am just highly disappointed in the lack of quality and the deterioration within 1 year.I would not recommend purchasing an Intex solar cover."
3,Intex Pool Cover,This cover is a good deal; it keeps the pool warm provided it gets put back on as soon as everyone is out of the pool. The material lasted about 2 years (8 months of use) before it started deteriorating. Not the best solar pool cover we have had but definately worth the price.
4,Amazing,We got this and put it on the freezing pool and within hours it was ready to swim! But is was a very sunny hot day this will get the best results
4,seems a good product...,"bought this for my 14ft pool, I know it is not the right size but I could not find a 14ft one, nevertheless I just turned in the edges to fit, we had some nasty wind that night and it did not budge as it sticks to the top water... not really needed for me as our weather here is very hot, but thought it would help to stop the mass amounts of bugs that keep dying in my pool at night, highly reccomend this for anyone in a cooler environment... this can be cut very very easily for a smaller pool like mine with sizzors."
1,Solar Pool Cover,"Received product in good time and in good condition. However, it wasn't the quality I was looking for, nor was it like the picture on the box showed."
2,"Nice, but damaged","I bought this to cover my Intex 15 ft. pool. When it arrived, I noticed that there are several small holes on the surface of the cover. Otherwise the product seems to work okay, but for the price, this seems unacceptable."
1,Not at all what I expected!,I thought that this would slip over the blow up ring and cover the entire pool. Instead it just sits on top of the water. Does not keep the leaves and debris out of the pool as I thought it would.
2,Not so hot.,"Cover is easy to put on and take off, but it only keeps the first 1 foot depth of water warmer. Under that it's still freezing when the weather is cold. Maybe a thicker cover would do a better job."
3,Pool cover keeps out leaves,The pool cover is great for keeping out leaves. The cover also helps to heat the pool slightly but only about the top foot of pool water. We have a 12 ft pool and like that the cover is larger.
2,mike,The cover does not stay in place like it should and it keeps folding up. The only good thing about it is that it does help heat the water up.
5,great cover!!,"We researched lots of pool covers before deciding on this one. the Intex brand really does seem to be the best. it arrived quickly, was a fair price, and works really well! it keeps our water warm and really cuts down on chlorine evaporation. It fits very nicely right inside our metal frame 15 foot pool."
3,Way to big for 18 ft pool,If you are getting this for the 18 ft pool you would be better off getting the 15 ft one....it way to big.
4,This pool cover does help.,For the price of this pool cover it does keep temperature of the water at night. I ordered one for a 15' pool and it covers the pool with lots of material to spare. I have to tuck it in every night around the edge. It works and is a good bargain.
1,not at all what I expected,"its like a large piece of heavy bubble wrap - no tie downs, no elastic...and certainly only to be used in a area with NO wind...we put it on the pool, (it is square - tucked edges under the pool ring around top to no avail) and within an hour the wind had whipped it off - so - huge waste of money...not to mention hard to manage...grrr"
1,disappointed in intex,"I purchased this intex pool cover in mid april of this year, it is now august 20th and it has fallen apart. Went to pull it out of the pool and it has basically disintegrated, a big peice fell out of the cover while pulling it off, leaving a big mess of blue bubbles to clean up in our pool. The cover was $42, expensive for the quality and durability of the product, would need 3 of them to cover your pool for a whole year, since they only last 4 months. Called amazon, they directed me to call intex, I waited on hold for 28 minutes just to be told that there is nothing that they will do.If I would have known it was so cheaply made I wouldnt have purchased it. Shame on intex... I am very dissatisfied. If you are looking for a pool cover don't buy this one because you will be shopping for another one within a few months. I would not have given this item even one star, but it would not let me post my review without making a selection."
4,1 size smaller!!!!!!!,"This is a great solar blanket for the above ground pool style. Note, if you have the blow up ring, get it a size smaller for quicker, easier, and a less stressfull installation. If not, you might find yourself cutting the edge off later. In example: Wife and I wanted to save a little money after a nice rain and just keep the rain in the pool, instead of paying for it later through the tap. The water level was too high for it to be tucked and rolled under the edge as the instruction speak of. I took off about a foot all around and still have enough to use on a low or high water level. Also note, that the size of the pool is measured by its widest point, at the bottom outer layer, which is different from the top inner ring size. Plus it could save your a few dollars for the smaller size for probable a perfect fit!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Less than Great?,"This solar cover is okay. It is somewhat helpful in heating the pool but that's about it. It only floats in place, so if there is rain, wind, or anything of the sort coming, it has to be removed because it has certainly not been designed to withstand debris. I recommend finding a cover that serves both the purpose of heating a pool and keeping out the junk while in place!"
3,Annoyed,I have purchased a solar cover through Intex in the past and it has worked perfectly. I could not purchase one through Intex this time because there were none in stock. This one that I purchased through Amazon does not consistently work. Sometimes it heats the water and other times it does not. I cannot seem to figure out the reason. The times it doesn't work has nothing to do with the amount of sun or temperature outside. It could be a warm and sunny day and the cover has not changed the temperature at all. This 18 foot solar cover is larger than my previous one too. I am alittle disappointed in this purchase.
1,READ BEFORE BUYING!,"THIS IS NOT A COVER! It is a blanket. I have a 15' metal frame Intex pool. This blanket is not big enough to go over the sides, it just sits on top of the water. It is literally nothing but a big piece of blue bubble wrap! It will be useless when we close the pool for the winter. On top of that the instructions say this ""solar"" blanket should not be used in direct sunlight!?!? Seroiusly?!?! Apparently the air pockets will pop if they are in the sun!"
3,Too Big,I'm not sure what went wrong. The solar cover is much larger than my Intex 15' pool. The product description says it fits inside the pool. Mine does not.
3,Works when applied carefully.,"If you take the time to properly clean grime and rust, liquid works well. ""Rubber"" caps work great, but do add a little friction when adding or removing dishes."
5,No more rusty tips,I have used my dishwasher about 50 times since I applied the caps flowing the directions by cleaning the tips with steel wool and then alcohol. Let it dry .Applied the glue substance and then the caps. Still like new!
5,Great cheap fix,"Used on a KitchenAid top rack and also one prong on lower rack. Was unaware that our sharp butchers knives had made micro cuts in rubber coating allowing rust to form. Prices were around 150 each for replacement. Color matched almost perfect and sealed up nicely. Would suggest you paint outside as it does have a strong odor. I let it sit an hour and recoated, then let sit two more hours before installing. No odor by then and looks great especially for the huge cost savings."
5,good stuff,Works great in my dishwasher. Covered up big rusty spots. Would highly recommend it to others
3,No Frills,"This is definitely a no frills product - comes with a nail polish like bottle of vinyl repair and snack-size Ziplock with what I assumed to be 40 caps. No directions, but pretty self-explanatory. I've put all the caps on and painted over other rust spots in my dishwasher and it looks much better. Seems to work, hope it lasts."
3,Grey dishwasher repair kit?????,"While this simple and cheap reapir kit may work as described, it would help if they could ship the correct color that I had ordered.I ordered grey and what shows up--white. Good luck with your order if you're looking for a good color match."
3,Good Freestyles and slammin' beats for the Jeep,"This album is very good. I bought the previous installment ofFunkmaster Flex's 60 minutes... trilogy. This album mostly sounds like 50 rappers rapping over Mobb Deep's ""Hell On Earth"" album and Wu-Tang Forever's LP. Volume 2 had a little more variety as far as music is concerned. I liked the freestyles. My favorites on this album are the ominously funky track by Mariah Carey Featuring The League , Missy Elliott's surreal freestyle, Shaquille O'Neal & Sonja Blade's freestyle was very lovely (especially Sonja's), Wu-Tang Cream Team (Raekwon kicks some phat rhymes), A Tribe Called Quest and JD of Slum Village and Erykah Badu's were my favorites. If you are a Wu-Tang or Mobb Deep fan I would recommend this album, if you like New York Hip Hop then this is an album for you."
4,not a bad bit of jump'n,"works fine for me. One file(a program I backed up on this thing) wouldn't upload to my PC, but other than that works fine. Stores libraries of text and very large media files. Cap fits perfectly. Better than CDRW storeage which won't store files with riduculasly long names as driver files and updates. no problem at all up/downloading them with this. No need to zip them up or unzip for use. If you format your HD alot when your PC makes messy *(&^ and need quick restoration this is a blessing. If thier is a problem with storing/downloading it is probably from removing the device from the USB port too soon before/after use. Also stores songs."
2,"5 Stars for looks, 3 for feel, 1 for how it works.","Do not buy this controller! It is a Waste of money! After I had it for about 4 or 5 months, it broke. The character or vehicle would only go left on the screen, no matter how hard you turned the analog stick to the right. After a few days of that, the controller quit completely. I will not be suprised if my second one does the same."
1,Don't buy this controller!,"This controller is AWFUL! Yes, I was drawn in to the cool look of the controller (yes, as far as looks go, it rocks) and all the ""amazing"" things it can do to make your Episode III game better....but it totally doesn't do that. The response time is terrible after you push a button, making it nearly impossible to make decent lightsaber combos. And as for the programmable buttons-this is one of my biggest gripes-two of the four programmable buttons (specifically R1 and L1) are already supposed to be important buttons in gameplay-R1 is Force Push and L1 is Saber Block. If you program those buttons for a combo, you can't block attacks or use the Force. That's just stupid! A waste of money for me. I will stick with my trusty cord-ridden DualShock Controller."
1,One of the worst musical videos I've ever seen!,"It is a really big shame to find out that the video has the quality of a home made video. There is no logic. Papa Wemba appears performing 40 minutes after the DVD started! Before that everybody is there except him! The sound is terribly edited, the image is very bad and the performance is very bad as well!Everything looks like Papa Wemba didn't see the video before being released, otherwise I bet he had done something better. There is no subtitles... I think Papa Wemba missed a great opportunity to show to the international community his great talent as singer and performer. As a big contradiction, in his CD ""Emotion"", it is pointed out that he is famous by always dressing very well (Versacce and like that), however, in this DVD he dress very bad as well..In general, very disappointing, bad and poor production."
1,"Great Book, Computer Reading It","This is a great story, I highly recommend it. However, this recording is a digital voice reading it, so it completely takes away from the story. I love audiobooks, but this one was unlistenable. It was like having bonzibuddy read hamlet."
1,It is a copy of the previous book,"I am applying to college and I already owned the 2003 version of the book (which is very good, actually), but I wanted to read some fresh info about the colleges I chose. So I ordered this ""NEW"" version and was very disappointed. NONE of the colleges of my choice had ANYTHING new written about them. The Students Speak Out was simply the same as in the previous book, and you can read it for FREE on the Princeton Review site. The only thing that changed was the ratings part. They even took the students' quotes section from the previous book. It was utterly useless for me.This book is excellent as a first college guide, but I do NOT recommend it to anyone who has a previous version."
5,Best College Guide for Above Average Students,"This is the best college guide for students with SAT scores above 1100. I don't reccomend it for students will lower scores because it concentrates on schools that expect a higher SAT.This book rates college on academic as well as social factors so you can see if you fit in to that campus. You can read about dorms, party atmosphere, and what current students are like.One feature that I felt was great was... ""if you like a certain college you may want to look at""... This allows you to add new schools to consider.My high school daughter continually used this book to make her choice. I highly reccomend this book!"
1,Almost identical to last year's book,I understand that colleges don't change that much year to year. They say they only survey 100 to 125 colleges a year. The majority of the book is just a rehash of prior books. Some of the ratings are just bizarre. Save your money and just look up the book in a library.
3,Looks can be deceiving,"Looks are deceiving, in the picture it shows 5 items, but then the package was delivered there was only one item , therefore dont be fooled by the pictureWell the product ws good , and as expected for the value"
1,Not Recommended,"The author tries to portray Lauren refusing to give up her abstinence, but the line is drawn WAY TOO FAR!!! Though the book was well written, I hated it because the author doesn't really prove her point because Lauren is barely a ""technical virgin"". If you are a parent wanting to get this for your teen daughter, DON'T!!! It's a bad influence."
2,"true to life, but kind of cheesy","This book hits home for most girls as we all grapple with the issue of sexual relations before marriage. But, it seemed as if the author was trying *too hard* to be ""hip"" and ""cool"" and use slang that kids use now days. Nice story line, but a little more than a tad cheesy for my taste. In some areas, it was so cheesy it was painful while other times it flows along nicely. An okay read if you need to (I read this title for a report on STDs and teen sexuality) but I definitly wouldn't recommend this."
4,I enjoyed this book,"If the composers read this book, they'd be rolling over in their graves (especially Arvo Part because his not dead) This is a very funny book for those who love the music or want a comic look at the history of these fine composers. The drawings look like they came out of Mad magazine or someone who is just mad.(Ive heard that I could do better) Pick up this book music lovers and just have some fun."
4,"Nice product, good quality, super service",These are nice sweatshirts. Good quality and the prices is half what you might pay for a Champion brand. It is oversized so order your normal size and don't count on much shrinkage.
5,Nice sweats!,"I had ordered this and one in ""Smoke"" and they are very nice.Roomy not bulky great color and comfortable as anything."
4,Pigment Purchase,These sweats have a great colour range and are good quality. Just be aware that they are extremely generously sized so have no fear if you order the smaller size.
1,The colors here do not look like those in their on-line ad,"This is not a ""nautical red"", this is a pinkish red. I wrote in immediately and did not receive a response to my concern, only a form email confirming my correspondence. Quality is good if one is looking for other than nautical red."
5,Great sweatshirt,"I just received three of these. The construction is top notch, the colors are great, the finish is awesome and material very nice. The fit is very nice also. Just what you would want in a sweatshirt a bit oversized but not swimming. I washed them as soon as they arrived and better after the first washing. I am buying 2 more!"
2,truthinad,"The sleeves on these sweatshirts are a good 3 to 4 inches too long, even after several washes and high heat drying. Were they styled for orangutans?"
1,filmgeek83,"I can't speak on the EP, but I saw this band live last night opening for Nine Black Alps, and they suck harder than a 20 dollar hooker. It was unintelligable noise. If anyone tells you this band is worth a damn, don't believe them."
3,Cavalcade {VHS},"It is now obvious to me that the fact that this Oscar Best Picture winner is not available on DVD or hard to find and costly, is due to the fact the Master is of poor quality and requires restoration. Think all purchasers should be made aware of this fact."
2,Stiff upper lips-- and stiff movie,"Famous mainly as the obscure movie that beat King Kong, Cavalcade had an impressive reputation well into the 50s. But this tale of upstairs and downstairs from the Boer War to the 30s is not only stagey and creaky, it's snobbish-- compare it to In Which We Serve to see how completely Noel Coward's attitudes toward the lower classes turned around by the time their help was needed in wartime. The classism and the pacifism of it all are historically interesting, and so are some of the songs (it's not exactly a musical, but like Forrest Gump, uses music of different eras to set the scene quickly), but the performances and the script don't really hold up."
3,Cavalcade,"Certainly not one of the greatest films ever made, but it is interesting to watch the progress being made in film-making by comparing Academy Award winners for Best Picture."
5,Star Wars Wireless PS2 remote.,The remote was great. My father recently became a gamer and decided he wanted to relive Star Wars by playing all their video games and I sent him this controller. He was so excited to receive it. for younger guys sending new gamers game gear I definitely think they would enjoy this product and appreciate being sent such a git.
5,Here's the full house!,"Toy Biz has outdone themeselves this time with the new wave of X-Men Classics actions figures. I absolutely love how articulate and detailed each one of theme is.This is a great Gambit and best of all he features his lesser know X-treme X-Men duds. My only complaint with the toy is that Remy here comes with a DISK SHOOTER! Hey I know he can't use his powers right now in the comics, but this is a bit wrong. I would like it if Gambit would come with his trademark staff and cards, but hey you can always steal them away from the Marvel Legends Gambit, although you may need to cut the staff down to size.I believe anyone who is a fan of the X-Men will enjoy adding this Gambit action figure to their collection. As a Marvel Fan it earned five stars with me!"
5,A Must Have Bit. Period.,"I've used Dish Carving bits (w/ top bearings) from both Eagle America & CMT. While they were quite good, they seemed to wear rather quickly, and the lock collar on the Eagle America bit had a tendency to come loose during operation, which I'm here to tell you is not something you want to experience.By contrast, the Freud bit has chewed through a bit more hardwood than the other bits with the same smooth cutting capacity as the day I received it. The top bearing is held in place by a locking pin that is inset into a groove in the shank immediately above the bearing. There's no screw to vibrate loose or have to be super-glued in place. That means the bearing stays put ensuring that your cuts are smooth and uniform.I highly recommend this bit for anyone making bowls or trays."
3,Not much new,"I found Color Stories to be a quick fun read, but if you are a fan of fashion magazines and a cosmetic ""junkie"" you already know most of what is in this book. The story of the developement of Neutrogena cosmetics would have been more interesting if the product line wasn't defunct. I'm sorry I bought the hardcover version. This is better as a magazine feature."
5,excellent product. great transaction,This is a product that is not readily available in my area. This is the only cartridge that would fit in my Canon BJ85 portable printer. I bought this printer when I began travelling overseas. It fit great in my suitcase. The ink colors are bright and I can print quite a few pages for such a small cartridge.
5,"Burns, again","As usual, Ken Burns' documentaries are great. Particularly liked the Mark Twain and Frank Lloyd Wright biographies...what lives they led!"
3,Lacking depth,"I agree with the previous reviewer. More information is need in this book to match the title. Information about STRs and DNA techniques for the non-specialist is given in ""How to DNA test our family relationships."" ISBN 0966402715 This book explains in detail how to read an STR report for genealogy/paternity testing purposes."
2,Loud after a year,"It was really nice for a while - it did everything it was supposed to. But after a few months it has become very loud to the point of being useless. Another, smaller problem is that you need to refill it often to ensure it won't run out of water in the middle of the night, because if it does, it will scream like the train in ""My Cousin Vinny"" movie, instead of just shutting off!"
1,This product is so unreliable,"Today, is the third time I went to Sunpentown Product Support Center in the city of industry for the replacement of the nebulizer in two years.Although they only charged me $15.00 but the quality sucks.The golden plating on the nebulizer starts to have bubbles underneath. This means just about two to three days, it will malfunction. Do they perform life cycle test during design stage?Bad design, bad plating.I only use purified water so there is no deposit in the unit but it doesn't help.This unit has been discontinued.Shame on Sunpentown."
2,Stopped working and was hard to clean,"Started out great for the money(no humidistat but nice-sized tank, simple controls etc.). Was able to maintain a comfortable humidity level with a fill up every 1-2 days depending on the outside temperature. Difficult to reach all the nooks and crannies to clean and gasket on filler kept falling into tank during fill. Now, after 1/2 a heating season of use, it is barely working at all(unfortunately I tossed the box). I would spend more and get a different unit."
1,Alarm is a killer,"The low water alarm sounds like a fire alarm, it wakes you from sleep in an extreme panic! It is terrible and you cannot disable it. I of course did disable the alarm by turning off the low water sensor (with glue). Then, of course, the machine got low and now isn't working at all (burned out). That of course is my fault for disabling it but it was also not usable with the alarm because it honestly would wake my neighbors and make my cats incontinent with fear. Now I am out $50 because of a stupid alarm feature. Without this feature, the machine would be good as it is very quiet."
1,Stopped working after a year,"This unit started out working fine. It was quiet and sent out an adequate amount of moisture ... although you NEVER want this thing to run dry. The alarm is a true pain in the neck. After a few months, the gasket around the refill opening on the bottom worked loose and started to leak. After one winter's use, the unit started to become noisy and produce less moisture, even after regular, gentle cleaning. I cleaned and stored it for the Summer months, and it worked for about a month this Winter after coming out of storage. Then it completely stopped working. For this amount of money, I expect much better quality."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Worked well for the first 6 months, then stopped working entirely.Not worth the $50+ I spent.This is the second Sunpentown product I purchased that broke soon after purchase.Made in China; breaks in USA.Stay away from Sunpentown products."
2,Works well but hard to fill,"We have had 2 of these for 2 years. They work great but the filler is so hard to open that we won't buy another. The gasket comes loose and then won't stay in the grove made for it. They also don't work as well after 2 years as they did. We clean them and store dry when winter is over, but each year they have gotten less output."
4,great value!,"after buying and returning and buying and returning i got this.i had never heard of the name until now..over all great valueEASY to refill and use..the only thing is that we dont like is that if u have it right near your bed, and dont have a fan on in the room - and have it turned up all the way u can hear some drips (drips are the tank refilling the underneath area with water.. its normal)move it away and u cant hear it as much."
1,keeping dry,"I purchased this product that ultrasonicaly vaporizes water it is suppose to be completely quite, however it isn't. It sounds like a fan out of balance. Save your money, look for something better."
4,Great Humidifier but our first one had faulty switch.,"We noticed the difference in air quality, my boyfriend's snoring, my nose bleeds and dry skin right away. The tank is large and lasts for several days depending what level you run it on. Haven't noticed any of the ""white dust"" that I read about in some reviews, which supposedly is produced because there is no filter. I personally love that there is no filter to clean or replace.HOWEVER, couldn't give this 5 stars because after about 6 weeks of use the on/off switch would no longer remained pushed in so it wouldn't run. I had to send back to Amazon, who was fabulously helpful and got a new one to me right away."
2,Troublesome humidifier,"Output good and just a little noisier than my last ultrasonic which was a refurbished Bionare. Water gets slimy within a week, though, and cleaning thoroughly is difficult due to nooks and crannies on unit. Now unit has stopped working after only 3 months. It DID keep the room, 12 x 18, well humidified while it worked, though,"
1,worked well for 2 months then got VERY noisy,"Like several other reviews here, I experienced a problem with the fan. The unit worked like a charm for a couple of months, was silent, very easy to clean and refill. But then, the fan started rattling. I didn't keep the box due to a move so I can't do anything as far as a return. I opened the unit to see how I could quiet the fan but the mechanism itself is rattling. Basically, it is now useless because at night, all you can hear is something that sounds like a loose rattle. In fact it's so loud, I am sure the neighbor can hear something through the wall."
2,Off Beat!,"Tony never goes to the beat of the music when counting. Like the music was added after taping. Very annoying. When doing leg lifts, he works one leg for 120 seconds then the other for 150 seconds. It is like no one proofed this video! The real killer is during the cool down/stretch when he looks right in the camera and says, ""Do you feel pretty? You should"". Cracked me up! Try another tape for legs."
4,works just fine,"I read a couple of the reviews here, and was honestly a little doubtful, if I should really purchase this printer. I did anyway, because I couldn't resist the bargain. I have to say, it works perfectly. Didn't make strange noises, or give up on me. I am very happy with it. The print quality is not excellent, as to be expected from a tiny little machine like this, so I don't print my resumes with it, but for stuff on the go, it's perfect. I am very, very satisfied."
5,USED IT HARD FOR 3 YEARS AND CAN'T KILL IT. :),"This is probably the most incredible & durable piece of electronic equiptment I've ever owned. It's like the Bunny in the battery commercials....keeps going...and going...and going.I save on ink by buying bulk ink and refilling the black ink containers with a syring, rotating 3 of these. I have only had to replace the printer head 1 time. I have used the parallel cable for my connection, but will try the infrared with my new computer. Previously (3 years ago) , the infrared connection would not work...but likely due to new drivers, etc. Truly one TOUGH road warrier printer!"
3,Historically significant,"This collection of rarities from Buddy Holly and his Lubbock associates is certainly an historically significant one if you're a die-hard Buddy Holly fan and /or music collector. Highlighting Buddy's formative years before he hit the big time, the tracks are mostly country & western (with the emphasis on ""Western"")with a touch of rockabilly. The only drawback however is the quality of the original recordings. Even modern technology hasn't been able to resurrect these to a pleasurable listening experience. Most tracks seem muffled with lots of pops and crackles and even with a good pair of headphones are difficult to decipher. That said though, the actual music is good and worthy of a place on your Buddy Holly shelf."
3,"If you have the studio albums, you don't need this","The artist Sade is one of a kind. Her sultry singing and the elegance of her music are very appealing, but her first live CD is nothing remarkable. This disc doesn't add anything at all to her previous recordings. The band plays well and Sade's singing is reasonably good, but these live versions just aren't special in any way. The older songs such as ""Smooth Operator"" are done in a rather perfunctory or even lackluster fashion. There actually is one other live release from Lady Sade, the video-only ""Sade Live"" from 1994. That concert seemed livelier than this, but then that was visual and Lovers Live is just audio -- at least for now. A DVD release of Lovers Live is scheduled for release in two weeks. (I'm not sure why it wasn't put out at the same time as the CD.) The new Lovers Live DVD will have 22 songs versus this CD's 13, plus various DVD-only extras. I strongly recommend waiting for the DVD and passing on this CD."
3,"Good, but not good enough.","Having been a Sade fan ever since their inception I have to wonder about this release. It seems as though Sade had no say with regards to the production of this CD. ""Smooth Operator"" gets hacked and we lose ""Night Train"". It almost sounds as if the band simply stopped playing. Plus, the sound quality of the CD is also questionable. It seems like it lacks clarity.If I had to pick the best tracks here, ""Is It A Crime"" and ""Sweetest Taboo"" would be my choices. I would also recommend that you wait for the DVD to be released. It appears to have all the songs in their entirety. I would also speculate that the sound quality would be better as well."
3,Could have been better,"I purchased the DVD of this concert 2-yrs,. before I purchased the CD and was hoping to have the FULL concert on the CD. The CD represents only 50% of the concert that was on the DVD. Many great concert monments and songs were left off the CD. The band ""jam"" during Smooth Operator is one example. For those of us who appreciate the musicians talent, writing and production were left short.In addition, I thought the crowd noise was to high for a live production.The above reasons were the only reason not to give ""5-stars"". I only wish it would have been a double CD with the whole concert.For those who have the resources and a good quality home DVD set-up I would highly recommend the DVD of this concert. One of the best in my collection."
2,Nice try...,"This is an unfortunate attempt to stage the beautiful studio recordings of Sade and her collaborators on a ""live"" stage. Never a strong live singer and a rather shy performer, there is no reason for anybody to go to a live concert or buy this album, as most of the tracks are perfect copies of the studio originals (incl. soundeffects) and add nothing new. This does not mean that this is not beautiful music, on the contrary, but just not suitable for a live concert."
4,Audience noise is too loud!!!!,"Sade is one of a kind. Her music and her band are awesome!!! But let's get to the point: I prefer this album on DVD. I really got MAD when i heard Smooth Operator on this CD without the jamming at the end of the song while on DVD there is the full version of it. And the audience NOISE is really loud. If you got her other studio albums, don't buy this one. There's no need to."
3,Ordinary to me,I have followed Sade's Career for a long time.She was a Neo-Soul Artist before it had that Name.Her tempo&groove then as now hasn't changed nor Her Band.Live is just like the Record Essentially.you don't get any changes in the Arrangements here.very much on Script.Sade has a Aura about Herself but too bad She doesn't take more Challenges? She might shock some folks.nothing here overall is far from what you already know&have.
3,NOT ALL IT COULD HAVE BEEN!!,"IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SUMMER NIGHT IN TEXAS AND WE HAD BEEN WAITING TWO YEARS FOR HER RETURN. AND ONCE AGAIN SHE DID NOT DISAPPOINT IT WAS A MAGICAL NIGHT UNDER THE STARSSO, WHY THEN DID THE CD LET ME DOWN, IT WAS THE SAME CONCERT WAS'NT ITI MEAN THEY HACKED UP THE ENTIRE SHOW, THEY LEFT OUT SOME OF THE BEST MOMENTS, AND THE SONGS AS WELL.EPIC RECORDS COULD HAVE DONE A TWO DISC SET WITH THIS CONCERT COMPLETE, NOT WITH JUST ""FLOW"" AND ""CHERRY PIE"" ON THE SECOND DISC.IF EPIC CAN RELEASE THE CONCERT IN IT'S ENTIRETY ON DVD IN TWO MORE WEEKS I JUST DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY NOT THE CD AS WELLIF YOU HAVE NOT PURCHASED THE CD YET, DON'T AND JUST WAIT FOR THE DVD."
2,"Beautiful performance, RUINED!!!","Let me first preface this by saying that I adore Sade's music. When I purchased the live CD, I certainly expected there to be some crowd noise, but this CD is ruined by an audience that will not shut up. Rather than a respectful, appreciative audience these morons scream, hoot and holler through entire songs...often right over the quietest parts of songs. Sade cannot take a breath without some idiot screaming. While listening, you literally cannot count to 10 without loud hoots, and screams. To make matters worse, these sounds were intentionally mixed in through the house microphones. That's why they are so loud and intrusive. Beautiful performances ruined by Rednecks who thought they were at the tractor pull. Save your money, The label should remix and re-release this CD."
5,Excellent live album!,"Sade's live album was just superb! I played it over and over two years ago! I bought the live DVD earlier this year and love it too! She and her band do such a good job balancing the '80s and '90s hits with the newer songs from 2000's ""Lovers Rock"" in their live performances from two shows compiled for this album. Some highlights are No Ordinary Love (which I can't stop playing), Cherish The Day, Sweetest Taboo, Jezabel, Paradise, Somebody Already Broke My Heart, By Your Side, and the way she shrieks Crime in a dramatic, emotional way at the end of Is It A Crime. This is a live album in the finest way. Clean, clear sound and production for this album and the live performance!"
5,Worth buying for any Sade fan,"It's a great album of live tracks, representative of both her old and new works. For any fan of Sade, this is a refreshing addition to her portfolio. Sade's one of the rare artists out there these days that sound just as good live (if not better) than with the benefit of studio (over)production. A must-buy if you like her music."
4,Sade: smooth operator onstage.,"Not too many folks would think that Sade has a commanding presence in concert, but this pretty good live disc shows that she can hold her own in front of the mike. The track listing is rather similar to the show I attended in Chicago last year, and the bulk of the songs are from her last CD, ""Lover's Rock."" The most compelling of these songs is her rendition of ""Somebody Already Broke My Heart,"" in which she warns a new partner not to mistreat her the way her prior lovers did. Of course, there are also the requisite singles: ""Smooth Operator,"" ""Your Love is King,"" and ""Sweetest Taboo."" Live discs don't always appeal to me, but ""Lovers Live"" is a solid release that comes with my recommendation."
4,Lovers Live...,"Normally, I don't enjoy ""live"" albums due to the fact that the audience ""gets in the way"" of the music. But, still, I was pleased with the effort that Sade and her band put out. A very well done, well crafted album. Obviously, she gave the audience their money's worth, and they appreciated her effort. So do I!! The only reason why I didn't give this album five stars was the fact that she left out some very key hits from her early work that should have been included: ""Hang on to your love, Your love is King(among others)"" Still, it gets Four Stars!!!!"
1,"Love Sade, Hate the Live CD","The whole point of seeing an artist live is to go beyond the studio recording. If you want to hear it exactly as it is on the CD, then just stay at home and listen to the CD. I was very disappointed to hear very little that was new or different from the original recordings. Plus, the crowd noise does seem excessive. I could have done without this one."
2,"Inauthentic voices, language dispappoint","SAVAE is to be recognized for its valuable work in attempting to bring back to life the lost art of the newly converted Indians of mesoamerica. I had expected to love this recording, but I must report that my hope has turned to disappointment. My first disappointment came with being unable to get past the embarrassingly awkward Anglo pronunciation of the performers. My second disappointment was with the dispassionate voices. I had hoped to get a glimpse of the spiritual passion of indigenous persons who, even today, walk kneeling 2 miles up a mountainside to worship the Virgin of Guadalupe. I wanted to hear from the people who voluntarily sacrificed themselves on pyramids to Huitzilipochtli, the hummingbird god. The delicately meditative and polished voices of SAVAE have much to offer, but they failed to convince me that this was the music of the indiginous people I have come to know."
2,what a shame...,"Que pena! This could have been a triumph, were it not for the unbelievably poor pronunciation of the Spanish and Nahuatl languages. Though I agree somewhat with other reviewers about the lack of passion, frankly, this is so trumped by the pronunciation issue that I really couldn't get past it. The voices are good but not outstanding (the arrangements are great)and so it really needs/needed authenticity. Linda Rondstadt's Canciones de mi Padres is one of my favorite recordings of all time, and she does not speak Spanish (though she was certainly familiar with the rhythms and culture, as you would think these folks from Texas are.) Anyway, close but no cigar."
3,A different approach to medieval music,"A refreshing departure from the nation's apparent obsession with Celtic and ""celtic"" music, these are Central American madrigals. All are sung in their original language. Not bad, but nothing too memorable."
4,"Solid Bon Jovi record. No groundbreaking songs here, but competence as always","This is what is becoming a typical Bon Jovi product: expertly crafted rock / pop songs, well placed and contagious chorus all around, a few ballads, some great Sambora chorus, but no big riffs. It's all covered in a wall of sound, in a overproduced way.It's a good record that searches for absolutely no new ground in the Bon Jovi catalogue. If you're a fan, you'll enjoy it (but if you are an inteligent fan you'll realize how they are repeating themselves here). If you're not a fan, there's nothing Bon Jovi will do that will ever please you. They are like the hit TV sitcom FRIENDS: love them or hate them."
4,Have A Nice Day,"Overall this is a pretty good album from Bon Jovi. I love the two opening songs and the closing song. Some songs are better than others, but its Bon Jovi and they're amazing!"
3,"HAND is not a great album, nor a bad one, BUT","See This Band Live. I was somewhat disappointed in this album. Yes, I really liked the title track, but overall the album's material lacked imagination and there is too much recycling of old ideas. However, as to Bon Jovi's current Tour, the sold out 19,000+ concert I attended was incredible."
1,NOT REALLY A NICE DAY,"SI QUIERES CAER EN EL ABURRIMIENTO TOTAL O DORMIR UNA SERPIENTE COBRA COMPRA YA ESTE ALBUM. ES UNA VERGUENZA QUE UNA BANDA DE GRAN TRAYECTORIA PRODUZCA UN CD DE TAN BAJO PERFIL. REALMENTE ESPERABA QUE MEJORARAN LA CALIDAD DE LOS TEMAS DEL CD ANTERIOR, PERO PARECE QUE NO TENIAN MAS NADA QUE HACER Y SE DEDICARON A PASAR UN RATO GRABANDO ""ESTO"". SINCERAMENTE ESPERO EL DIA EN QUE BON JOVI SE DEDIQUE A PRODUCIR UN TRABAJO QUE AL MENOS LLEGUE A LA ALTURA DE ""NEW JERSEY"" ESE SI VALE LA PENA DE RESTO ""KEEP THE FAITH IN YOUR REAR POCKET"" O MEJOR INVIERTE TU DINERO EN OTRO CD QUE SI LO MEREZCA."
2,Buy it just for the album cover.,"Did you know this album cover might a have a strong resemblence to-you guessed it-The Kool-Aid man. Oh, Yeah. Anyway, the cd would probably make a good frisbee. Here, boy-catch it."
3,Nice Effort,"Bon Jovi's Have A Nice Day is meant to be an ironic title as most of the lyrical content finds Jon Bon Jovi in a somber mood about the state of the world. While none of the songs are overtly political, they have a darker, harder edge that shies away from the band's usual rising above it all lyrics. Despite the shift in lyrics, the band's sound is still the loud, meat & potatoes arena rock that they have been playing for over twenty years. Bon Jovi has struggled with critical respectability and at times they seem to be reaching a little hard for it on the album, but they are a band that respects and plays hard for their fans and that counts for a lot."
5,GREAT CD,"As a Bon Jovi fan since the beginning, I have to say I loved this cd! Great songs! Love every one of them."
5,"Same as Bounce, but without ballads that suck.","This is the best album since These Days. It's powerfull, good rock and the ballads (Welcome to Wherever You Are, Bells of Freedom) look much more like their old good ballads (I'll Be There For You, Bed of Roses) and are SO much better than the ""ballads"" on bounce (You Had Me From Hello, Open All Night). The stron rockers (Have A Nice Day, I Want To Be Loved, I Am) look very much like the good rockers on New Jersey (99 In The Shade, Blood on Blood) and that is saying something about the quality of the music on this outstanding CD!"
3,It's no Bounce,"After Bounce I had very high expectations and they were let down big time. This album is way too poppy. Bounce had some great hard hitting tunes and yes some pop and ballads which was a great mixture. Have a Nice Day is just pop and ballads. Where's the hard stuff? This album needed a ""Hook Me Up"" or ""Bounce"" style song!!!Overall... boringggggggg"
2,another wack album by Bon Jovi,"how have these Cats gotten away? don't get me wrong during there Hey Day of Hits they were alright for a moment,but nothing has changed.same use of Power Chords&Arena Rock Anthems.not much has changed with there formula of songwriting&Music Making. I give them Credit for hanging around,but Musically speaking they ain't changed there tune."
1,What Happend?,"I am a huge fan of a lot Bon Jovi's earlier albums like slippery when wet, but when I heard this album I was wondering how once a really decent band that had great songs like 'livin on a prayer' could make something like this. The only reason I bought this was for the song 'Have A Nice Day' once I heard them preform it on Oprah. Nothing on this album is catchy or enjoyable except for the one song 'Have A Nice Day'. This album absolutly is junk, and I dont understand why people are giving it good reviews, they must be a hard-core Bon Jovi fan and be loyal to everything they do because this is absolute trash!! Dont waste your hard earned cash!"
3,NOT GREAT BUT STILL GOOD,HAVE A NICE DAY IS A GOOD CD . IT BETTER THAN CRUSH AND BOUNCE. BON JOVI IS THE BEST ROCK BAND IN THE WORLD.
2,Could have been better,"I really like the song ""Have A Nice Day"" which is quite catchy but no other songs on the album really stand out in my opinion. As a whole the album lacks variation and is mediocre to say the least. Take my advice and try before you buy.P.S. Anyone who awards this album 5 stars must be a Bon Jovi fanboy or more likely a fangirl. 'Nuff said!"
5,"Bon Jovi back to their roots, with a little of Today mixed in!","This Album is one of those albums that you will not get bored listening to at all. Even after a few months if you move onto another group or artist, you will come back to this record. The album is filled with Bon Jovi old style catchy tunes. The vocal harmonies and great guitar fills and solos give it that classic Bon Jovi feel.Compared to Bounce, this has defintley raised the bar for the band. It feels that they put more heart into this record than the last one.Some of the best songs on the record are...Have a Nice DayI want to be LovedWelcome to Wherever you areLast CigaretteI AmStory of my lifeLast mand StandingWho say's you can't go homeWell thats more than half so you get the idea of how good the record is.So 5 Stars for me, and I'm not a jovi boy!"
5,Another Great Bon Jovi Album,"HAVE A NICE DAY is yet another great Bon Jovi album. The songs are a blend of his early hard-rock roots with his current sound, which is sort of like East Jersey's answer to the Outlaws. The title song is a kiss-off to anyone who's ever pushed anything on you that you don't want any part of, and ""Who Says You Can't Go Home"" is a song which expresses the theme that no matter how much you try to get rid of your past, it will always be there. This is a great CD, and the fact that Jon Bon Jovi advocates sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, makes this disc an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience ."
2,Not So Much....,"For any long time fan of Bon Jovi that enjoyed their anthem style rock, this album will surely disappoint. Not that Bon Jovi was ever really hard rock, but Ritchie sure knew how to play the guitar! Now it seems that they want to cover up his playing. Like someone else said, any studio player could play this stuff. There is very little riffness here. Have A Nice Day is a good song on it's own merit, but still does not rate with the many classics that fans of their original music will appreciate. Most of these songs sound like they belong to Oasis or the Backstreet Boys, not one of the greatest ROCK bands of the 80's."
3,It will grow on you,"I have been a BJ fan since they have been around. I aggree with a lot of the previous reviews that the album does lack the rock element you expect from the the lads. It does sound like these songs were written years ago but just didn't make it on to previous albums, and now they have decied to put them out there. The album is good and worth a listen and it does grow on you. Unfortunately it does lack the 'great solo's' which we know Richie can deliver. They've been around for 20 years and not many bands can compare to that. If you like Bon jovi you don't need people telling whether or not to buy it."
4,Bon Jovi cd have a Nice Day,Was good but not their best in my opinion but cd was in perfect condition
5,Have a nice day- Bon Jove,"I love all of Bon Jovi's albums. I just needed to add one that I didn't have to my collection. Its a great album, and Bon Jovi is a great band."
5,The best Bon Jovi album in years!,"I LOVE this album! I truly enjoy every song on the album, unlike ""Crush"" and ""Bounce."""
3,Middle of the road Bon Jovi,"I have heard this album once to date, and the first thing I noticed was that it sounded to me like a re-hash of all their past material already released, same sound and same rythms. I also do not think there are any songs on this record that are any were near the same calibre as Bon Jovi's past masters like 'Living on a Prayer' or 'In these Arms'. Over all just a middle of the road record, with nothing of mind blowing quality."
3,awight,"It aint bad, but it aint no New Jersey either....Should have left Last Mand Standing alone...."
1,C-Sides at best...,"Last Man Standing would have had hope except they reworked the song. The better version was on the box set. Last Cigarette, Novocaine, Bells of Freedom, Who Says You Can't Go Home, all very psuedo-pop tunes. This sounds more like Tom Petty or the Wall Flowers. No punch at all. Have a Nice Day is a 3rd rate anthem. This album is just as lousy as This Left Feels Right. Bounce & Crush had better songs on them than this effort. Since Crush, their album sales have been slipping. It's great that this album is number 1 in Scandinavia & Japan, but when was the last time either place cranked out a great band of their own? It's still ok to do straight-forward rock & roll. Don't let today's radio tell you differently."
1,bon jovi attempt pop-punk,"if ""the all american rejects"" decided to make a pop-punk record for the over 30 crowd, it would probably sound like ""have a nice day"". hell, one of the songs even sounds excatly like ""dirty little secret"" by TAAR. I know that with the success of crap bands like good charlotte and green day, and solo artists like avril lavine, everyone wants to do pop-punk, but that just isn't bon jovi. Have a nice day makes you wonder if Bon jovi will ever rock out again like they used to. meanwhile, i'd suggest passing on ""have a nice day"" unless you're a wannabe mall goth who thinks hot topic, fye and good charlotte are, like, ""so totally cool""."
4,"Good stuff, for what it is...","Bon Jovi is no longer the edgy rock band they once were (not that they were ever all that controversial). Poppy CD with a few catchy songs. I see that when one makes millions, they sing about ""The story of my life"" and ""Welcome to wherever you are"" - of course its happy to be how life turned out for you...What can I say, they found a formula and have stuck with it..."
5,Great Rock,"Bon Jovi's still got it. He and Jennifer Nettles make a great team on ""Who Says you Can't Go Home""."
4,The Band Is Back and has not lost their luster,"I had waited quite a long time for this cd to come out and I was not dissapointed. From the first song ""Have a nice day"" To the Duet with Jennifer Nettles you see the vast variety in style and tone of songs. You can see songs from HEart breaking songs such as ""Novacaine"" and ""Last Cigarette"" to up beat songs and encouraging songs such as ""Welcome to where ever you are"" This last song was the song that I personally Took to heart. Very rarely does a song touch my heart such as that one. This is definately a good cd for the die hard bon jovi fan as well as one who has never heard the band before."
3,Bon Jovi Reviewed,"Bon Jovi's newest colorless production from Bon Jovi, guitarist Richie Sambora, and John Shanks, with Desmond Child acting as executive producer for the whole thing, gives ""Have a Nice Day"" a sound that's a bit too monochromatic for the band's ambitions, or for its own good: at times, getting through the record can be a little bit of a chore, since there's not much fun to be had here.""Have a Nice Day"" gets John Bon Jovi reaching new variations and coming back to the conclusion, fans already know the result, stick with what you've been doing and it will be a good day indeed."
4,Not bad.,"Well... I can't say I like ALL the songs in this cd, yet there are great ones like I am, welcome to wherever you are, Bells of freedom and Last man standing. I also like Have a nice day... even when it sounds like Everyday and It's my life. They seem to be part 1, part 2 and part 3 of a same thing... which is cool, I like that. But please, no part 4.But what can I say about people who has released so many great cds, anyways? I'll just shut up and keep the faith ^_-"
4,"Not the best, certainly not the worst....","Okay...so the hair-band days are over. We all know that. I appreciated the last Bon Jovi concert, when they played one old song between one new one. Sometimes it's good to relive the past. The last few albums have certainly been a departure from the earlier music. I liked them, though. The first time I heard Have a nice day (the album), I didn't really like it. However, after seeing them perform these songs live, and then listening to it again, it really caught on. Now, it's one of those CD's that is in my player at least once a week. I love the title track, ""Who says...."" and ""Welcome to wherever..."". It's not the music I grew up to, but then again, I grew up. I don't listen to the same music that I did in jr. high and high school. I'd like to thank Bon Jovi for sticking around and giving me music to grow up with."
2,Running on empty.,"I never thought it would come the day when I just wouldn't care to buy the new album of Bon Jovi. But this band is finally running on fumes. The band's secret weapon is running silent. Richie is nowhere to be found on this album and without Sambora this band is doomed.Have a nice day is the same recipe, it is just recycled material. A carbon-copy of Bounce and Crush. Bon Jovi has become a parody of itself and it is running on empty. Either Bon Jovi re-invents itselfs, charge up the battery with something similar to the masterpiece of These Days or it will implode. Thumbs down."
2,Morph from Ork,"Hints of a country band realized.....That said Bon Jovi brings you.....Lost Highway. There have always been overtures towards country music from JBJ from Wanted: Dead or Alive, to The Blaze of Glory soundtrack. You knew, however, that they would be followed up with a Bad Medicine or 99 In The Shade. It is becoming apparent, as they age, that they will rock less and croon more..... Sad but true. JBJ's Slippery When Wet voice abandoned him years ago. He's learned to pick his spots, like an aging fastball pitcher. But....he is from Jersey so...I like him....I'll just listen to SWW and NJ more! Keppin the Faith!"
4,Not bad,"After all these years, Bon Jovi still makes great rock music. Although this album isn't their best, it still has the catchy beat and lyrics which have carried the band so far. The duet with Jennifer from Sugarland is fantastic."
4,Have A Nice Time Listening,"I think this is Bon Jovi's second best album (Bounce being number one). So why can't they get any airplay besides country music channels. Why must everyone ignore them to include radio and TV. This disc is packed with more little gems from this rock and roll powerhouse. Every song is good and again the songwriting is top notch. But don't just take it from me, get and listen for yourself, you'll be glad you did."
1,[...],"You know it is time for Bon Jovi to pack it up when they associate themselves with that HORRIBLE singer Bob Dylan. Bon Jovi wasn't good to begin with but with each new album they make(such as this one), they keep driving themselves to ROCK BOTTOM which means they suck! Seriously, [...]"
1,"Yes, Jon, 100,000,000 fans could be wrong...","...especially when your mathematics is a devious lie. But that's another debate. Proving once and for all that their longevity has little to do with raw talent and plenty to do with pure chutzpah [and an ever-dwindling fan base], the latest in a long line of drek by these cliché-mongering, former pin-up boys proves neither a growth or regression - it's a quintessential Bon Jovi confection - pallid ballads and unintentionally hilarious faux-rock, over-produced, and in grand, never-let-me-down Jon Bon Jovi fashion, sung with the most bombastic over-the-top whine this side of Celine Dion on steroids. They are so awful they are not even bad enough to enjoy anymore. My grade: C-"
2,Bon Jovi need to put some effort,I'm writing this review so other fans don't waste their money on this. Besides the title track there are only mildly acceptable tracks and then about 5 others just plain suck. I wish I hadn't spent my money on this. I wish Bon Jovi would do something decent soon.
3,Same Old Song and dance,"With the exception of ""Have a nice day"" (wich is musically and lyricaly an ""It's my life "" clone, not to mention the video...)and ""Last man standing"" this CD again looks and sounds like another Jon Bon Jovi solo proyect... please don't get me wrong! the songs are good but still not the tracks you expect from these guys who will certainly be remembered for the magic generated from Slippery when wet and New Jersey records. I'm a big Bon Jovi fan but I'm not sure if I will go the extra mile this time..."
4,It's a nice day,"I really enjoy this CD. Bon Jovi' new CD ""Have a nice day"" is fun and motivating. I enjoy the lyrics and the music. True and new Bon Jovi."
1,amazon should be ashamed for selling this one.,"Do not waste your time renting, much less buying this awful movie. A five year old could do better than this with a video camera and some trick or treat costumes. I am not kidding. It is really that bad.It looks like the director decided to save money and put the movie together in about 24 hours. I rented this one because I am a vampire movie fan and was really shocked with how bad this one was. I mean there was better acting and camera work in my family's home movies.To quote Homer Simpson from one of my favorite Simpsons' episodes, "" I've seen some sucky sucks, but that was the suckiest suck that ever sucked."""
1,Spare us this mess.,"I wasted two bucks renting this pathetic piece of cinimatic crap. I actually forced myself to watch to justify the loss of my two dollars. I cannot believe a national chain would stock something this terrible. There is absolutely no plot whatsoever, just these two vampires running around killing random people and getting orgasms by some gay mind trick. ???? It looked like it was shot in a barn and a cheesy 70's fright house using some kiddie camera. No talent either. I was as if the ""director"" had picked some people outside the local homeless shelter to star in this travesty. Seriously, I would rather play in a construction site porta-john then watch this movie again."
1,Don't waste your $3.75 on this one.,"I really dislike these low-budget movie projects. What a waste of $3.79.With characters that try to be ""The Sopranos"" and The Godfather (1972) are a gang of New York hoods. Some sound Italian. They like to kill young people, but the difference with this gang is they are male vampires.Heavy on profane language, loads of red corn syrup used for blood. Might be funny to some people, but just another low-budget dysfunctional film. But I do respect people trying to get into the film business.Forgettable film."
5,'Strange Things' A Vampire Masterpiece,"Up until tonight, Blade II was my favorite vampire movie of all time. It was dark, violent, and had fun action. All of that changed, though, after seeing Strange Things Happen At Sundown. This is to vampire movies, what Dawn of the Dead is to zombie movies. It's quick, graphically violent, darkly funny, and profane. It's probably what would happen if Quentin Tarantino would have directed a vampire movie.I already mentioned that Strange Things is violent, but it simply must be seen to be believed. It's definately in the top 10 most violent films I've ever seen. And the ending is simply brilliant, just like the rest of the film. So see Strange Things Happen At Sundown if you're a fan of vampire films or independent horror movies. You could do worse. Actually, you couldn't do much better."
3,"cool film, and gory","Strange things happen at Sundown succeeds in many ways for an ultra low-budget horror flick. It's gory, funny, sexy, and full of Tarantino's profanity and action. Overall Strange things Happen At Sundown is a fun film."
3,ok when it works,"Local Auto Parts store carries it which starts with auto and ends with zone. I just bought three of them for only one of them to work. The one that worked, worked well.Pump and turn over and Dump into a container. It can be a little messy."
4,Realistic to a fault,"Set in Manfred's Siouxland of western Iowa during the Depression, Elof Lofblom comes home to Chokecherry Corner to help his father run his store. His father is mean and abusive; his mother is dead, probably from overwork and abuse. Elof rebels against small-town life, chases some girls and sows some wild oats (though he doesn't neglect his duty at the store), and then marries Gert and settles down, his fate sealed. Manfred's style, as in all his books, is crude and lowbrow on purpose, and will not be to everyone's taste (I'm not very fond of it myself). The novel is a realistc portrait of rural America during the 1930's; I thought it a better work than Manfred's THE GOLDEN BOWL."
2,Dispersive,"I bought this product as part of a research on small-world networks, since I wanted to gather some knowledge on social networks in sociology.I put it aside after four chapters for the following reasons:(1) the introduction is a ""punch in the stomach"", scaring readers with the use of heavy technical lingo;(2) the other three chapters seem more of a recollection of empirical studies, doing little to offer a truly logical framework of reference.I recognise it might be personal taste, and my disorientation might also be due to the fact that I am no sociologist (I am a law student). Still, what I would expect from an introductory text is less divagation, and a deeper focus on the actual concepts.Now, I'm going forSocial Network Analysis: A Handbook. The introduction, already, seems much more digestible than Degenne and Forsé's (in my opinion) poor effort."
1,Not good,I guess because of the price I should rank it higher. But I had another walkman that did the job in this price range. I lost it and had to buy this one. It was terrible. The sound was so bad I cannot even listen to it. No sound separation or range at all. I could barely make out the music I was listening to. Go for a higher end model cause this one is a waste of 13 bucks.
5,A window to the future,"Absolutely prescient...Although written in the late eighties, it rings a resounding bell today.In my humble opinion, it's a window on the past, present, and future - a condensation of controversial, yet seminal truths.It is a must read for any person with an inquiring mind. It is required mental luggage.Read it!"
1,Thank goodness I ignored this book!,"When I first read this book, I was very concenrened about the negative implications for the USA economy and stock market for the 90's. I considered selling all of my stocks when someone pointed out to me that these sorts of doom and gloom books show up at used book sales and stores on a regular basis. So I went to a couple of used book sales and stores and discovered this was right -- failed doom and gloom books have been published on a regular basis! Now this book will join the junk heap of history with its failed gloom and doom projections. For some, this book may be a fun read on how authors can appear erudite with their presentations of facts and research and still form non-sensical conclusions. Others, who themselves believe the sky is falling and we are doomed, may find comfort in this book as they will have company in their paranoid theories."
5,Chocs away!,Just a good few songs with two new tracks which are as good as you'd hear on disposable income infact all over now is even better.
5,Pretty dress watch,"This is a very attractive watch...classy, elegent, tastefully simple. Just got mine today, its much nicer than I imagined."
4,"Great dress watch for the price, looks good","I bought this watch as a gift for my wife's birthday. I knew what she would like. This dress watch turned out to be a good choice. The package arrived within 48hrs after I placed the online order. Packaging is really good. Kudos to seller on these points. When my wife tried the watch, the strap was large fit, so I emailed seller for suggestions on how to get resized and I got prompt response."
2,On the other hand....I didn't like it,"This is one of those CDs that tear your heart out; you know the kind -- the cut on the radio (Old Days)gets you excited, you purchase the disc and in the background, the record company is laughing because ""you've been had""!! Simply put, this would have been a great CD if 1) the vocals were better (or, better yet, nonexistant), 2) Ronnie didn't try too hard to sound ""urban"", and 3) he could have resisted the urge to repeat the ""hit"" w/o vocals (will anyone really know the difference to choose?)Word to the wise...if ya want Jazz, IT AIN""T HERE!!! Go get Ronnie's ""Brotherhood"" or the ""Tribute to Eddie Harris"" discs."
4,"Cool CD, just not a big variety of jazz, more urban sounding","The track Old Days/Old Ways is great, but this cd is not very impressive, and the vocals are just average. If you are looking for something unique, you might love this album, but many people that expect a ""smooth jazz"" sound will be left a little bit disappointed after hearing Dream a Little."
5,the book is an excelent piece of scholarship,"The book is an excelent piece of scholarship which exibits an extraordinary mastery of medieval literature. However, it contains some odd and inexplicable editorial errors especially in the Hebrew text which is often sensless. Nevertheless it is a unique and ground breaking work and is highly recomended."
4,"Pop, yet fun.","I am not sure what one of the previous posters was implying by asking if this were Christian Music? Considering track 8 is about self love, I find the possibility of this being Christian Rock probably null and void. This cd is not going to change the world. It's nothing briliant. It's nothing amazing.However, listening to it, something becomes very clear. It's fun. Yes, you heard me. Fun. It seems like a death wish for music to be fun these days. But this is and it works. I agree with the earlier poster that it's a hard cd to like for most people. Hip hop fans will probably not like the guitar parts and the rock fans will probably find annoyance with the record scratching. But if you are one of those select few who can enjoy that happy medium and I do stress ""happy"" because that's exactly what it is. I highly encourage you to pick up this cd."
3,ALright Poppy Rap-Rock,"This CD was alright, but nothing special. They could have done without the interludes and replaced them with other songs. But there were a few good songs on it. Right Hand Mand is one of my favorites off of the CD along with a few others. Some will like this CD. But you won't die without it. But if you ever find it in a bargain bin or somewhere real cheap, pick it up. It may surprise you."
1,sucked,"well this cd sucked it only had 3 songs and they were the same word only different styles, and what kind of music is this anyway? christian? well i thought it was a little waste of my money but i do like the rythm and words but when you sing it 3 different times it gets kinda old!"
4,WOW....,"Recommeded by a guy giving out a demo tape in a skate park in Seattle, I tried the demo and needed more. Had to have the CD. It's sooooo cool. It's funny and serious. The beats are way cool and the lyrics are catchy. I've since recommended this to friends and we all love it. Gotta get it you guys. (Female point of view)"
5,The best of French Pop with a late 80's early 90's sound.,"I first heard Daho on the radio while traveling in France in 1991. I bought the album before I returned to the States thinking this guy could be huge in the US if Americans would just be more respeptive to hearing music sung in another language. Unfortunately Americans aren't, and they miss out on some fantastic music such as this Album. Recorded in New York using the latest in technology and excellent musicians, this album has legs. Eight years later it still sounds fresh and current. He is the only French musical artist I know who makes the French language sound natural or even appropriate in the rock or pop venue. Good Stuff."
4,One of my favourite French albums,"A wonderful record. Moving, melodic... and you can dance to it! Daho spins enchanting images out of wittily poetic lyrics. Even if your French is not your strong point, the music and the rhythm of the delivery are potent in their own right. Definitely the place to start for Etienne Daho, who I'd place alongside artists such as Jacques Brel and M (Mathieu Chédid)."
1,"Highly speculative, full of unproven conclusions","This show is well produced and captivating. Unfortunately, its conclusions are based on opinions and speculations, not in actual evidence and hard data. The guests are not scientists, but just writers of non peer-reviewed books and magazines who express their speculations and opinions. Overall, a very weak effort aimed to sensationalism."
5,Ancient Aliens,"This series is excellent. It is interesting how then made connections between religion, art, and other historical accounts with ufology.I would definitely check this out. I definitely believe in ancient astronaut theory because A) I do not think God stopped with earth and B) Since I believe in God and His son, angels, and demons I believe in aliens given the fact that these entities do not originate from our world. I truly do not believe that disclosure will discount all religions on the planet and throw everything into chaos. We really need to get out of this 1950's mentality.Check it out. The DVD is worth the money"
2,Makes a joke out of ufology,"It's shows like this, and countless others, that make a joke out of the whole ufo phenomenon. It's no wonder most people view believers as wackos, and I am a believer!! Almost all of the guests on the show seem to believe any magical / fantastic story no matter how ridiculous and then tell you how it's due to ancient aliens on top of that. Maybe there is something to the ancient alien theory at it's basic core, but the only thing you'll learn on this show is how over the top people become in their zest to believe in ufos and aliens. And how far people will reach into the land of fantasy to try to make something fit into what they want to believe in."
1,ancient aliens,"Don't wast you time on this stuff.It's proven to be a total lie.Look at ancientaliensdebunked.com here you will learn the truth about this series.I have many dvd's on this series.Throwing them all away.Lies,the people that are interviewed are lieing.I watch alot of the history channel and love it.But after i went to ancientaliensdebunked.com i will not watch ancient aliens anymore.Do not wast you money on this series.Watch it on youtube if you have to."
5,History & Speculation,I love this series. It's a nice blend of historical fact and speculative theory. You can totally buy into the ancient alien ideas or completely dismiss them and still enjoy these shows.
4,If you love the series,If you are intrigued about aliens and their visitations then you will like this. They point out some very controversial issues about the ancient civilizations.
4,Makes Ya Think,"Bought this a while back and I have to say they bring up some interesting theories on here, im yet to get the other seasons but probably will because you will spend alot of time watching this"
4,The quest goes on.,"How building structures, communicating, and society make ups all vanished forces the mind to accept that someone had a vast amount of knowledge that this society doesn't have. The quest for knowledge continues. This series forces the mind to think about things. It has already reversed--now it's hard to find someone who doesn't believe in outside help."
4,ETs ?,"It's truly an interesting take on history . Whether you believe in aliens or not , the show certainly presents evidence in an entertaining way ."
3,Aliens or Nephilim?,"To me the term extraterrestrial is correct when referencing the Nephilim. I tend to agree with the first five books of the Bible as it records a time when 200 of the fallen angels took human wives and birthed a generation of hybrids. I believe the Ancient Alien series is reviewing the impact these hybrids had on humanity. Hybrids were enormous in size, called themselves gods, were very hard to keep fed...so, you have massive stones that got moved, you have human sacrifice worldwide, and an angelic non-human condemned soul combined with a human body that dies. So what was moving that object when no one else did? Ancient Aliens takes a look at the possibility of extraterrestrials impacting the world and the human race. Instead of creating a problem for those of Judeo/Christianity...this only confirms what many already know. Enjoy the series."
5,The greatest!,"These shows are exceptionally interesting. There is little in depth about ET life. I love the possibilities this gives! I have never seen or read anything so thorough about aliens as this show. Really wonderful! And of course, immensely captivating like practically everything put out by the history channel."
5,ancient aliens/ season 1,"WOW, I loved the serires so much I ordered season 2 as soon as it became available. Pretty interesting stuff and presented well. It has great scenery and pictures. A must for people with an open mind!"
5,Ancient Aliens,"Excellent dvd w/o the commercials if you missed the series on TV's history channel, all 5 episodes on one dvd."
4,Facinating Informative Serious Show,"This is one of the most well produced shows going into the details about Ancient Aliens. Being they explore many angles of this phenomenon, it is clear there is a lot to consider. I have watched a number of the shows and maybe I missed where Von Danikan shows how the statues clearly indicate those depicted were wearing backpacks of some sort.Regardless, this is essential history that needs to be recognized."
4,INTERESTING,"I ENJOYED THIS SERIES, GIVES YOU ALOT TO THINK ABOUT. IT MAKES YOU WONDER HOW MAN COULD ACCOMPLISH SOME OF THESE THINGS WITHOUT SOME FORM OF OUTSIDE HELP. I BELEIVE IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THERE ARE ALIENS OUT THERE THAT MAY HAVE VISITED EARTH, AND THIS SERIES MAKES IT SEEM PLAUSIBLE."
5,Great show,"Definetely a must see... The best is how it shows the tons of ""what if"" that pushes the natural curiosity in our lives..."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"We used this text for one of our introductory courses for one year. The layout of the material is well organized and concise which we liked. However, we found the anatomy art to be difficult to relate to. Much of it was to small or the color was not appropriate to distinguish between the anatomy. For example, the anatomy on page 104 is done poorly. Radiography students need much more detail than is shown in this text. We also feel that the students need to be exposed to more than just the basic projections. The radiographs are average and we feel that students need more quality. We are returning to Merrill's for all of our courses because it is comprehensive and is the best value overall for the students."
3,Light introductory text,A very nice lightweight book. Not comprehensive enough for radiography students unless used as an introductory course. Computer generated anatomy art is not as detailed as other similiar textbooks and much of it is to small. Radiographs are average in quality. A great reference for limited x-ray machine operators. Cannot be used as a reference text with the exception of basic x-ray views. Clean layout and nicely arranged.
5,The Jesus Creed,I was not sure what to expect from the title but it is very enlightening and readable. We are using it for a Bible Study over the next two months. Thank you
4,A Good Read,"The thing I respected the most about Scott McKnight's book was that he showed respect to the Torah of the Jews. Taking the Shema, Mr. McKnight showed how that Jesus respectfully expanded this time-honored prayer to include the love of others as well.I may not agree with everything he says as it relates to his interpretation of the ways of the Jews, but this book is truly a good read. I believe that everyone can get a better glimpse on what it truly means to love the Father as Jesus loved. This book is not overly deep but can be easily understood."
4,Nice,"Look great on the trailer. Are a little wider than thought, but will work great. Just wish there was a cover for them incase you aren't actually using the tiedowns or incase something (like a hammer) is dropped on them."
1,Didn't get the E-Clips,I ordered 3 and they arrived without the e-clips. Kind of disappointing as I was trying to finish my motorcycle trailer. Without the e-clips it's not worth the cost.
4,A Dog's Life,A curiosity piece of man's best friends! Not exactly the great American pastime but it may make a good Fathers' Day present! I wonder if he is going to raise or call?
5,"Greatest piece of art ever,","i mean c'mon, dogs playing poker is an absolute art classic, i love it, it's funny and i got it really cheap."
1,"I know it's a tacky print, but...","This is extremely poor quality. The paper is very thin, and the print itself is horrendous. It's very low resolution and it looks like the printer was running out of ink while it was printing. I'd never order a poster this large from this company again. I'd return it, but I don't want to waste any more money on this $.01 poster. Awful."
5,Great,"For the price, size and image quality of this poster, I am really happy. It looks great and was cheap. Looks awesome in my man cave/spoiled princess of a dog's room."
3,Loving Family dolls not for Sweet Sounds Doll House,"My daughter loved to play with African American dolls for a change. The only problem is that these dolls are not for the Loving Family Sweet Sounds Dollhouse. The Sweetsounds dollhouse dolls (the Caucasian ones) all have hearts on their back to activate the different sounds in the house...the African Americans do not. So, if you want to have Black dolls this is fine but its not for the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse."
4,Cute family,"This is a really cute family. Mom and little sis have real hair...not painted on or molded hair. Love the way the joints move so they can sit and stand independently. However, they are smaller than I thought so the furniture in my daughter's doll house is quite over-sized but they still work. They are a bit over priced too."
1,Never received,I never received my order and had to file a claim. I was given a 2 week delivery time range. I contacted the seller and they never responsed to any messages.
4,very decent,"I have these plugged to my Xbox and they're very decent.I recieved them for Xmas,set 'em up to my Xbox and BAM,GREAT SOUND!The reason why I rated these 4 stars is the sound is not THAT good;its good,but not THAT good.But overall this system really KICKS for the money"
1,"AVOID LOGITECH SPEAKERS (well, these anyway)","I bought these 6 months ago and they began cutting out last night for no reason. I must have messed with them for 3 friggin' hours with no luck. I wish I had stuck with my Creative Speakers; thankfully I kept them in my closet and I'm using them right now. maybe other Logitech systems are better, but these? YECHHH!"
2,Too much bass,"Certainly this speaker system looks great and it's wired remote is a nice touch. However, the bass that this unit produces drowns out the sound from the satelite speakers even at it's lowest setting. Why make this so bass heavy? I'm returning mine for something less violent."
4,Great for the Price,"I gave the Logitech Z-3e 4-out of 5 stars becuase I have noticed the smaller ""satillite"" speakers (the small ones)tend to pop and crackle when pushed to there limit. The Sub is very powerful and add much needed low end. If you keep the volume at a ""normal"" level these speakers perform very well."
1,HELLO KITTY BACKPACK,I BOUGHT THE HELLO KITTY BACKPACK IT IS THE WORST QUALITY EVER I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IS ACTUALLY FROM SANRIO. AS I WAS PACKING IN MY DAUGHTERS SCHOOL BOOKS INTO BACKPACK FOR HER TO USE FIRST TIME BIG ZIPPER KEPT TEARING AND THE SMALLER POCKET ZIPPER BROKE OFF COMPLETELY
1,Don't bother,"I have never seen a bag contructed so cheaply. It may as well have been made of kleenex. The bag lasted less then a month before ALL the zippers were broken, I would look else where."
5,Most under rated album of the year!,"I saw the ""Los Angeles Times"" and ""People"" magazine reviews of this album and it disgusted me! It's hard to believe that magazines of their caliber could be SOOO far off. They really made fools of themselves. This album is incredible! Dishwalla is EASILY the nations best kept secret! Listen to it 3 or 4 times straight through and it will take hold of you and not let go. The lyrics and over all ""feel"" of this album combined with its modern sound and emotion leave it in a class of its own. A truly unique, driven album that must be listened to and not just heard to be appreciated. If more people were more familiar with Dishwalla they'd be huge! * An added note to these magazines... maybe get someone who's familiar with the term ""rock music"" to do your reviews - Grandma and Sister Theresa have better things to do!"
5,one of the best recent releases,"Rarely do songs impress me on the initial listen as did these songs. As I listened to each song they just kept pulling me in. The overall texture and melody of each one was rather refreshing. A majority of material out there today is fairly one-dimensional. It definitely sounds like this band has progressed from the prior release. I purchased that CD (Counting Blue Cars)after this one. It just didn't grab me the way this one did. Highlights: Until I Wake Up -- a nice airy, emotional piece. So Much Time -- a nice balance between being hypnotized then waking to electric shock! Powerful.. Definitely enjoyed hearing some Beatles influence! A must for the discerning ear! ENJOY....."
3,5 stars? c'mon people,"This is not a bad CD by any measure, and you need a measure to rate a CD. Nearly any Dishwalla Fan Would say that ""Pet Your Friends"" is better, and then seemingly proceed to give them both the same 5 stars. I have given this CD the fairest most objective assesment I can based on many different aspects. I have also owned it for 6 months and listed to it at least 15 times all the way through. and when all is said and done, 3 stars is what I give, because I know these guys (If not other bands) are capable of better. By giving every disc 5 stars, its nearly impossible for those shopping to find the best first choice. If they Make the wrong first choice they may not buy another from that artist, so you do not nescesarrily help the artist buy automatically giving everything 2 thumbs up."
5,An Awesome CD from an awesome group,"When I first listened to this CD, I was disappointed because it was different from their 1st, ""Pet Your Friends.""But, then I listened to again. Once I got past the differences in styles between the 2 albums, I loved it.This is one of my favorite albums and I suggest you buy it!"
2,DISHWALLA! YOUR SOAKING IN IT....DIRTY DISHWASHING LIQUID.,"Dishwalla's latest effort is basically a muddled mess. There are a couple of good cuts, but for listenting pleasure this CD has nothing to offer, and it shows by how the public received it. With few sales, and drab reviews, it is time for Dishwalla to go back to the drawing board. Check out their previous ""Pet Your Friends"" that is a 4 star event."
2,lacking vocal strength and enthusiasm,"I am a big fan of Dishwalla and am somewhat dissapointed in their latest release. With the strong voice that the lead singer has, the album lacks the power of his voice and the enthusiasm of the band. They need to make a more upbeat, rocking album to recover from this one. I do like Dishwalla, don't get me wrong, I just know they can do better and want to see them suceed."
5,One of the best bands ever,Dishwalla is so talented. They're music is great and they strike a chord in me. I saw them in concert and they totally blew me away. This cd is awesome. Everyone should have it!!! I love Rodney!!!!!!
2,2 good (excellent) songs = 2 stars,"The album itself is boring and apathetic. However, I do believe it is worth owning for the songs: ""Until I Wake Up"" and ""Stay Awake"". These are very good songs. The lead singer has an incredible voice, and the band has a very pure sound throughout. My complaint is that rest of the album is hardly listenable, unless you are in the mood for background music. The melodies are boring and the overall dynamics and flavor within songs and song to song are drab. Even when I try to force myself to like other songs, it just doesn't work..."
1,Questionable,I kept really surprised with the other albums but this one... I don't recomend to anyone. This is not Dishwalla! The musics are good but the lyrics are NOT! Better to wait for the next album. You can buy any other album even if your eyes are closed but I don't recommend this.
4,Enjoyable but ....,"I bought this book to give to my daughter's 2nd teacher who is in her first year in teaching. It is a private school and very sheltered and she seemed interested in my stories of substitue teaching. I thought this would be both fun and enlightening about the ""other side"" of teaching.When I opened the book - I gasped, literally, and thought to myself, ""I'll never be able to pass this on."" I went on to read the book, which is very entertaining. I told the teacher about the book but told her I couldn't give it to her as a gift because if her mother caught her with it, I'd be mortified!!!It is very entertaining and an easy read. If it is a gift, you may want to scan it to make sure it is appropriate for the receivee."
1,Save your money,"I really wanted to like this and am by no means a snob about writing but this is the first book I've ever read that I wondered how it even got published. As other reviews have said it repeats itself a lot and comes across so amateurish it's questionable any sort of editorial process happened. That the author pursued writing for TV sitcoms is not surprising. It's simplistic like a sitcom, most of the jokes are flat (and many not so much a joke but a cliche) and it's so disjointed it'd have been better structured as a series of essays. There are some good core stories here with the potential to be funny but it consistently fails."
4,No One's Even Bleeding,"New age vision of the public school system. Witty, biting, commentary about the world of substitute teaching. Highly recommended."
2,Starts off good....but gets boring,"The book starts off good and interesting, but I feel like some parts are repetitive. Nothing new or exciting is ever introduced. Kind of like a long soap-opera. I still haven't finished the book because after reading about 3/4 of it; I just don't have a desire to finish the book because it doesn't seem like anything meaningful is going to happen."
1,No One's Even Bleeding? How About the Reader?,"Based on the positive reviews on this site, I bought this book. I suspect someone is cramming the mailbox. It's hard to believe anyone but an oversexed fifteen year old would find it interesting. I read it but more out of shock and disbelief than genuine interests. The wisecracks are not funny; the author has no idea of how to write dialogue and interior monologues; his paragraphing is awful, and his use of offensive language, excessive. How the publisher overlooked these problems is astounding! A first year creative writing student could have done a better editing job. Did I mention it was overpriced?"
2,No One's Even Bleeding,"This book is not as bad as some of the reviewers have claimed. But it isn't nearly as good either. There are some funny moments to it. But the story goes nowhere. By the third or fourth chapter, the author repeats himself aimlessly. It's hard to feel any sense of compassion for the main character. I'm not a prude, but the sex in the story seems irrelevant. My biggest complaint is that it is way over priced, and to be honest, there are better things on television. And that's a sad comment on any book."
1,You get what you pay for,"This tape player doesn't have a rewind button, and flipping the tape so you can fast-forward it instead is a pain in the middle of a workout. The headphones are also low quality; they certainly don't handle the full volume range of the player, which isn't even that great. The radio reception is also poor. In sum: Bad radio, low volume, terrible headphones, no rewind."
1,Awful,I bought this product and it is godawful. I may have gotten a faulty one because the sound is so awful. The range and sound separation is terrible and the volume is horrible. I tried to use it on a long plane trip and was very dissapointed.
1,avoid this product,"I bought this walkman thinking i would get a good deal on it. However the quality is extremely poor. The walkman is extremely bulky at best. The headphones are poor. The sound qualiyt is worse, often you would be only able to get sound out of one ear. There is no rewing button so listening to casettes can be difficult. In addition, the switch that changes the walkman from casette to radio is difficult to use, this goes for the power button as well.Bottom line, get someting else."
3,Tape Player not that Good!,"This cassette player is ok, the radio player is pretty good, except for some stations, like 89X, it doesn't come out very good. and the tape player doesn't work very good, it actually ate one of my tapes! i fixed the tape but i havn't played any tapes in it, i just got it today, 1-4-01, and i might return it, unless i can get it to work, the radio, which i bascally ordered the whole thing for is pretty good, and that is why i bought it for when i go running, and biking... so it is ok, i would get it for the radio but not for the tape player."
4,"Very nice, one complaint","It's a beauty. Nice saturated red color, neither pale nor dark.I was hesitant to buy a color model, as the chrome nose section seemed like a cheap thing to do. But it's such a perfectly mirrored finish, it looks great next to the shiny red.The only problem is that the ink refill rattles a little inside the pen. The tip goes through a spring, just like you would find in a retractable pen. When writing, it makes little click sounds as the ink tube moves around in the hole. This can be fixed easily enough by carefully wrapping a single layer or two of tape around the refill before inserting it."
5,No idea.,"I'd heard about these pens over the past 20 years and never had the opportunity or found one for the price I was willing to pay for one.From using it just for a little while, I love it. Best pen I've ever used, smooth writing and easy to handle, not too big, not too fat to hold and fits great in a pocket, also looks nice too while you're using it.Also it's refillable and from other things I've read, the refills last darned near forever, so one or two will last me years."
3,"Great for beginners, wish there was more","This book is an amazing general overview of becoming a goaltender. the beginning of the books is more-or-less common sense for goaltenders that are already playing, but the middle of the books and the drills at the end serve as a great refresher course. If your a beginner, this book is great. If you want a refresher course in goaltending, you should also buy this. I believe that the only thing lacking in this book is a more in depth section on equipement. Not everyone understands what they are supposed to be looking for."
2,"Comfortable to wear, hard to use music player",The backpack is great. The buttons on the iPod controller stick or sometimes don't work at all. I am sending mine back for a replacement.
5,"Sensuous, Earthy, and Heavenly","With the common thread of love songs to the soul, this collection of global, world beat sounds acknowledges every level and every chakra in unabashed celebration. Sensuous, earthy, and heavenly, in a breathtaking mood of wonder and awe, these love-based pieces resonate deeply through body and mind, kissing the soul with un apologetic affection. I was surprised at the wide range of moods. Rich with bass tones and interwoven percussion alongside astounding vocals, this album will find a variety of uses, from wooing a potential mate to comfort in times of distress to energetic housecleaning. It conveys a feeling of knowing the listener to a depth that can be disconcerting, and is sure to be popular with both young and - well, those not quite so young."
5,Lifesource UA-767PV auto blood pressure monitor,This monitor is very easy to use. I also purchased the Lifesource power adapter for use with this product. I checked this blood pressure monitor at my doctor's office and it is very accurate. It is one of the monitors that my primary care manager recommended. I am very pleased with this product.
2,B.P. MONITOR,UNIT PRODUCES VERY INCONSISTENT READINGS. THIS IS THE SECOND UNIT BY THIS MANUF. THAT WE OWN. THE FIRST WAS JUST FINE; IT IS 13 YEARS OLD.
3,"Monitor is so-so, but no case to store it in.","I bought it partly because my office mate had one and her's came with a nice case. Mine is now being stored in a the cardboard box it came in, which will no doubt get destroyed with time.That said, the monitor is easy to use, but I get different results if I test myself several times in a row. Sometimes they are fairly big differences, although usually somewhat close. I'm not sure if that's normal or not."
2,Returned Product,L returned the blood pressure monitor because I had difficulty using the arm band by myself.I needed to do it by myself and I was unable to manage without assistance.
5,easy to use,"Easy to use and seems very accurate when comparing to values obtained in the doctor's office. I haven't bothered with the memory feature because we keep a written record. I highly recommend this device for those concerned with tracking their blood pressure for health, or medication monitoring."
2,Miserable Angry Performance,"I've seen Bill Maher live and really liked him. I like his New Rules CD even if it is a little flat without an audience - same as Miller's readings. I like his generally smart, though provoking style and there aren't many doing it. However, this performance is just miserable and angry and just not fun to watch. Didn't find the humor. Bummed me out Bill."
3,dated material but still fun.,the materials here are already dated. but still some topics are thought provoking. he makes funof a lot of issues. his views however of religion signifies that maher hasn't matured yet andhas not awaken to the real reason of why humanity was created. i think that he is just trying tobe controversial to get more audience.
5,Thoughtful & Funny,We have watched this several times now: shared with friends.I bought it for the title and found it to be One of My Favorites Bill Maher dvd's. Smart. Funny. Not Raunchy or mean just asking OH WHY did we get this far into Such A Mess?? in an odd way- very hopeful. Bill Maher is a Thinking Person's Comedian.
4,Difinitive Strawbs Collection,"The Strawbs were not just a fine band - they were several! The earliest bluegrass-flavoured manifestation is not represented here, but the development from introspective acoustic balladeers, to purveyors of folky anthems, to epic prog-rockers, and almost back again via flirtations with the pop charts, are all here on this very satisfying collection. The distinguishing feature throughout each lineup is, of course, Dave Cousins' remarkable voice. Standouts include ""The Man Who Called Himself Jesus"" and ""The Battle"" from the first ""real"" Strawbs album (OK, the Sandy Denny one has its moments), the brilliant single ""Lay Down"", and longtime favourite ""The Hangman and the Papist"", but every track is worthwhile."
4,"Thirty years around, and this collection sums up their best","The Strawbs have been around for some thirty years, but if you're not planning to buy all their stuff, this double-CD collection 'Halicon Days' gives a fair impression of what the band was like. They never really made the big time, but the latter duo Richard Hudson and John Ford gave them a surprising hit in 1973 'Part Of The Union'. They also had a hit (in England, that is) with 'Laydown', both tracks - of course - are included on this collection. Most worthwile are the tracks from their early '70's albums 'From the Witchwood' and 'Grave New World'."
3,a nice read with many good insights,"It's a fast read and sort of light reading, but I found it filled with endless interesting insights into how the internet has and will change our lives. I expected it to be fluffy and instead found it informative."
3,On the Waterfront it's not.,"So wholesome, so white bread, so innocent, so 60s nostalgia for the 50s. The guys: great hair, cute faces, no bodies. The girls: big hair, 24 make up, and full dress bikinis. Everyone: pushing 30 while trying to look 18. The jokes are lame, but so's the plot. Check out Linda Evans ""singing"" and see if you can recognize another character in the background who'll meet up with her 20 years later on the set of Dynasty. Good clean fun...though best suited for drive-ins."
4,Correction,"I wanted to clarify that Annette's song ""I'll Never Change Him"" was NOT in the original theatrical version of this film. The truth is it was cut from the original version before it's release, then added back in for the subsequent television version. It would have been nice to see it as an extra on this DVD, though, or even restored to the film."
1,Not for the novice.,The instructional format seems to assume that the reader is a novice in need of step by step instruction yet the glazes and techniques he describes seem appropriate for a person with years of experience and a fair amount of equipment. The novice could use pages of detail and hints on when and how to bisque-fire ware and a couple of dozen pages on the basics of commercial glazes.
4,CLOSE TO PERFECT,"I AM INTO POTTERY ONLY AS A HOBBY. BUT I DO IT NEARLY EVERYDAY NOW, AND ALSO I LIKE READING ABOUT POTTERY. IN POTTERY, TO MY BELIEF EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THE GLAZE. IF THE GLAZE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH, OR YOU CAN'T APPLY THE GLAZE PROPERLY YOU WILL NEVER ACHIEVE A GOOD FINISH.I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY HELPFUL CONCERNING TECHNIQUES. IT ALSO GAVE ME MANY IDEAS. I THOUGHT THE LANGUAGE USED WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO FOLLOW, WHICH WAS A BIG PLUS.ACCORDING TO ME ART OR DECORATION BOOKS, MAGAZINES ETC. SHOULD ALL HAVE MANY, COLOURFUL PICTURES. I THINK THAT THIS DISTINGUISHES ART BOOKS FROM NOVELS.GLAZING TECHNIQUES CONATINED SUFFICIENT PICTURES, AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE BOOK LEFT NOTHING ELSE FOR IMAGINATION BUT I CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH OF PICTURES.SO IN SHORT I THINK THIS BOOK IS CLOSE TO PERFECT AND IT HAS ITS PLACE AMONG MY FAVOURITES IN MY BOOKCASE."
2,technical but uninspiring,"This book provides good information on glaze composition and firing, and has nice pictures, but there is little to help one explore techniques. The pictures show a variety of very interesting glazes, but rarely tell you how to make something like what you see, and sometimes don't even tell you what the glaze or glaze technique is. This was very frustrating, since I was hoping to get ideas from the book on what to try, but the techniques did not necessarily have pictures, and the pictures were rarely linked to the techniques."
4,Good product for the price,The Scanning is OK on this unit. For the price I paid it is a good product. If I were to buy another one I may spend a bit more money and get one that has more functions. But like I said for the price I paid it is very nice.
4,Canon Personal Copier Review,"I purchased this copier to replace an earlier model of the same type that I used for 12 years. Had I not forced cardstock through the previous copier I would still be using it. The newer model is almost exactly the same and I will probably use it for may years assuming I learned my lesson with card stock. I give it only 4 out of 5 stars because it can't handle card stock. It has some tiny parts that hold springs in place that assist with the paper feed. If the tiny hooks had been metal rather than plastic my old copier would still be going and going and going...Don't expect to use this for heavy-duty, rapid reproduction. But you can expect good quality copies. It is easy to change the toner and is a perfect home copier."
1,canon personal copier,"Clumsy, not user-friendly and contrary operationally to other Canon PC's I've had. Not recommended! Altho, it DOES COPY!"
3,Copier,"I bought this copier several years ago and it has work well for me. I like that it can also do legal size paper. It does take up alot of desk space due to the two paper trays. I think that there are better choices now. This copier doesn't have an internal paper tray, doc. feeder, or enlargement of image."
5,Canon PC430 Personal Copier,Not for high volume of copies needed for some businesses but for home use it is an excellent choice. Easy to use with uncomplicated controls very accessible. Copies are clear with darkness/lightness either automatically of manually controlled. Legal sized copies versus only standard size is a real plus over other similar copiers.
3,Old style copier,"My new copier seems to work good, but I was horrified when I contacted Canon about registering this purchase online. They told me not to bother registering it because it was a copier they haven't made for 10 years. That certainly makes me nervous that I have bought old technology at the least. I can only hope to get past this downer and enjoy my new copier again. I guess more research was needed on my part. This purchase makes me feel stupid."
1,Hate it,"when I ordered this cd i was expecting to hear the music the way it was orginally recorded. Instead on the last track almost all the words are bleeped out because of the language. No where on the page I ordered it on does it say that the music is censored, it says on the package explecit language but it is a lie. I am very unhappy with this purchase and it is very wrong of you not to inform people that what they are buying is not the original music. It will be the last time I buy anything from amazon again."
1,vague and cryptic,Omg... no you did not find some one to publish this tripe!Well it did have some non- vague aspects... the third chapter was wonderful and I found my self almost staying awake..
1,Don't Bother,"I didn't expect the novel of the year when I purchased this book, but I expected a decent, frivolous book with a couple of entertaining storylines. Instead, I was privy to short stories which once they grabbed your attention, they abruptly ended and a new story began. The first story was entertaining and the subsequent stories were terrible. I couldn't even finish the book. Just don't bother with this book. Save your money for something else."
3,rip-off,"As a matter of fact, the product purchased is fine. However what I don't like at all is the hideous freight charges. Having contacted UPS, I know that the parcel in fact could be airlifted for at least 50% less. So I will never purchase from this source again."
4,Douglas DC-6 and DC-7,Very well done. Great photo selection and reproduction. Clear consise text. Excellent coverage from inception to later life. This would be a 5 star if printed on coated paper and if it had some color.
4,A little bit too saccharine,"Another highly thought-of 'must see' classic, a 1970s film depicting bourgeois Edwardian life. Amost too good to be true, everyone is always immaculately attired and has perfect manners, and interiors are spotless - unbelievable, isn't it? A simple story of perfect children, with a perfect mother and a slightly less than perfect father who goes to jail - uprooted from their perfect London town house with its' maids and opulent interiors - to end up in a small Yorkshire village in a simple country cottage (although having seen Panorama on TV the previous evening, about people losing their homes in London - most of us would nowadays give their eye teeth to live in aforementioned country cottage - with or without electricity and running water), the story revolves around the little station and the comings and goings of the trains and the part they play in the childrens' lives. Old fashioned, heartwarming, a fairy tale from another era."
5,"A Lighthearted, Fun Movie","When I read that Dinah Sheridan had passed away, I saw mention of this movie and decided to watch it. I haven't seen this movie since I was a child but remembered the three children. This was one of my favorites as a child and as I watched, it made me wonder how we've come so far from the values and convictions taught in this film. I wont repeat the description or give anything away. Most of the movie takes place in Yorkshire, so you'll enjoy scenes of rural countryside. This is a movie about adapting to circumstances, caring for others, conviction, generosity and honesty. Wholesome entertainment with characters that display good values. This is certainly one for the family."
4,Victorian Railway Masterpiece,"Most of the family will enjoy this, especially if they like Masterpiece Theater movies. This is the style like ""Pride and Prejudice"" where over time a familiarity and respect develops. This is similar to Disney movies made about 30 years ago. They don't make many like it any longer unfortunately. Three English children are told their father will be away for some time and they must go to the country to live like the poor. They are saddened and yet optimistic there will be new things to see and do. The settings in Victorian England are very well done. The cast and story is what really makes the movie. Special appearance by Sir Richard Attenborough is well received. Even though he is only seen briefly throughout the movie, his part is well performed. This movie is not fast paced, but if you are patient about watching it will pay off. Fans of foreign movies like ""Waiting for Ned Divine"" will probably enjoy it."
4,Good Stuff,This manual contains many photography tips with colorful examples to improve your photos.
4,Great Info. on the Endless Mountains,"The book is well written and provides good information for the hiker enthusiast. However, better maps, possibly topographic type from quads. and photographs, that would entice the hiker, would make this a five star book. It's good to see a book written about this area of Pennsylvania, which is truley a hidden treasure!"
2,Does not work well,"While the idea of this toy is great, the implementation does not work. The subs shoot off in wild directions rather than going straight. The rubber band you use to fling it sticks out of the front of the sub & causes it to turn rapidly depending on how it sits after releasing it. We could never get them to go straight. just quick circles. The target was useless because of this."
3,Hmm...what?!!,"If you listen to Fugazi's albums in order you will realize that they started progressing ever since they released their first 2 EP's (13 Songs) and every album was a progression from the last, their latest being ""The Argument"". This EP, (released the same time as ""The Argument"" album) contains songs that the band felt didn't fit onto ""The Argument"", these songs recall Fugazi's older style (the sound the band had on 13 Songs). In fact, the title track of this 3-song EP (""Furniture"") was one of the first songs the band wrote in 1987, exists in it's re-recorded format here. An instrumental and another new older-Fugazi-style track make up the rest of this EP. My question and problem with this 3-song EP is ""How can you ignore 14 years of progression and write 2 songs that sound like they are 14 years old and re-record one song that is 14 years old?!"". I am just surprised that a band as forward-looking as Fugazi chose to release this."
3,Good for collectors and the devoted,"This 3 song EP does harken back to Dischord's vinyl days, and I suspect that's why Fugazi released it in EP form. The main track is a very old (yet very good) song with all the old-style Fugazi punch and vinegar. It's only previously been available in bootleg form (not counting the Instrument film), and now, in keeping with Fugazi's trademark courtesy toward their fans, is available in legit and properly record edition. The other two tracks are nice and typically Fugazi, but not as strong as the main track. ""Furniture"" alone, however, makes this worth the modest price (compared to other CD singles and EP, that typically run [$$]or more for the some amount of music), but it should be noted that like much of Dischord's back catalog of various EPs, it's hardly essential."
3,Controlador de ventiladores Zalman,Deberia tener un manual mas explicativo y no unos dibujos en la tapa del carton del empaque. Debe ser montador en un case media torre o torre completa. Los conectores son de 3 pines y no permite de 4.
4,10 years old love this,"My 10 year old daughter really likes this toy and enjoys playing with it, however there was not enough furniture for the entire house.Now she wants me to purchase furniture."
4,The Naked Face,"The Naked Face is a terrific ""first"" for Sidney Sheldon. From the beginning to end it keeps you interested and when I say interested, I mean curious as to what's going to happen next. What can I say, it's a murder-mystery, so it will keep you guessing as to who the suspicious stalker/murderer is. Although it's not his ""best"" it's still a good quick-read, to enjoy and satisfy the simple things in life - reading."
4,Sheldon's First Novel is Highly Enjoyable,"THE NAKED FACE is Sidney Sheldon's first novel, written in 1970. It wasn't much of a sales success for him, but I really enjoyed it.This novel is a straightforward crime thriller -- someone is trying to kill the main character, a psychologist, and he's trying to figure out who the killer is before he becomes the victim. Is it one of his patients? Is it someone involved with the police? I was surprised by some of the twists in this book.THE NAKED FACE isn't a masterpiece, but it's a fun cat and mouse story that you can read in a few hours. The pacing is pretty fast, and I found THE NAKED FACE more exciting overall than a lot of the contemporary thrillers I read these days.This novel was written over 30 years ago and it admittedly has a dated feel. But overall it's worth your time, especially if you like Sheldon's work."
3,Very bad end.,"The first 3/4 of the book are good enough not thrilling but you'll be entertained, the part that Dr. Judd is hearing the tapes of his patients is boring but you can stand it, but at the end, SS thought that he has written enough and that he has to end the book no matter what, so he ends it with a fight and who you think wins to a mob prizefighter?"
3,One size doesn't always fit all,"The robe wasn't bad color and quality wise but would have fit a lot better if I were heavier. The pockets were in the center when it was wrapped and tied. Also I am 5'8"" and felt it was way too short for me. A measurement of length (or the height of the models) would have been useful information."
5,Sensual,"If you enjoy fragrances with hints of vanilla, this is just perfect. Not to strong, not too soft.. it is very sexy and the smell will last all night long."
3,"Despite the errors, a charming book","Despite the many grammatical errors already pointed out by a previous reviewer, this book does have its charming moments, and is a fairly well-written (minus the errors) tale about Diane de Poitiers and her life. Many famous historical characters make significant appearances within the book, such as Catherine de Medici, whom the author doesn't much like.I enjoyed the flow and thought the descriptions were particularly well done. It's just too bad this wasn't better edited."
3,courtesan,"athough i must admit that diane haegers imaginings of love are idealistic and childlike, she writes beautifully and creates three dimensional characters that a reader cna become attached to. her story is not realistic concerning human nature, especially a kings, but she paints a picture of eternal love that can make you weep for your own lost innocence. i throughly enjoyed her book."
1,Boring...,"I normally love any historical fiction. This book though was hard to read. I bought it in Oct 2010, and I'm just pushing myself to finish it now almost a year later so I can take it off my kindle.Its dry, its uninteresting, and its above all so boring I cannot recommend this to anyone, ever. I have read 3 books on Catherine but never about her rival Diane. The story seems to jump around, you don't always know who is talking to whom and I could never get into the story, its just flat. It was my first book by this author and I will be staying away from any of her other books. Its a shame, I'm sure Diane was a fascinating woman, but you just don't see it here."
4,Family holiday cookbook,"Filled with good, creative and entertaining ideas and recipes. Excellent as a gift book for any family get-together ."
4,Great cd...,This is a great cd with some classics on it (ODB and House of Pain) and lots of new stuff... A must buy for every hip-hop fan.
5,cutest sneakers ever,these are the most adorable sneakers. I have them for my son in white and silver and they are just adorable. I would say they run about a 1/2 size smaller then normal.
5,Great for chubby feet,I bought these for my 20 month old. His feet are very chubby and we have a hard time finding shoes with enough room. These are great for wide feet!We are very pleased!
4,Tastes like the real thing,It tastes like the real thing. We enjoyed every color. For a quick alternate we now make our own using hot water and use a thick concentration of any powdered drink mix. We then cool it in the refrigerator. But if you don't want to fuss with the mess then these syrups are great.
4,Ice Syrups,I bought this Snow cone syrup for my nephews and nieces for treats when they come to my house. They really enjoyed making and then flavoring their own snow cones.
1,Disappointing!,"Despite the positive reviews to the contrary, this package was a great disappointment. The .pdf files have typos (! ) and the suggestions were very simplistic."
3,This book explains a lot of bad things the US is involved in.,"This book is dense. If you're looking for a critical viewpoint, this book has it. I would have been naive if I were not Group Stalked as explained by David Lawson at [...]. Although Bioterror: Manufacturing Wars the American Way says it all, more recently the intelligence agencies figured out a way to make conservatives marry us social activists! The CIA can electronically rape a man, who doesn't know he has been electronically stimulated. Instead, he thinks he is attracted to the woman he is next to. I had no romantic dates for 15 years. Without plastic surgery, I now have dozens of men flirting with me. This is the work of the CIA!"
3,This one has a problem........,"I purchased this flat panel about a month ago at Bestbuy and have thrown away the box it came in. I thought it was normal for the screen to look like it was ""surfing"". There was also an area toward the bottom where the letters were faded. I have ended up putting the screen on Handicap access because changing the screen resolution made the text and icons so small I could not read them. I also tried to adjust the screen fonts after to make them bigger to no avail. Then I tried to use the ""auto set"" function on the flatpanel itself to let it set the screen fonts, and what a mess it was. I am really disappointed with this after having CRT monitors. I think I will go back to a CRT after this experience, they are much cheaper and more reliable. Paid 470.00 for a faulty product. My old Viewsonic 19"" CRT lasted 7 years and I may get a new one of those instead."
3,It works.,"Good design. Right size. It works.The clip has slid off of the pen a couple times. I'm afraid I might lose it one of these days.The ink cartridge is ok. It works, but the writing is not as sharp as I would like."
2,Bullet pen,"Its a small pen. That pretty much sums it up.As far as details, there was rust in our cap, and it doesn't seem to fit as firmly as you'd expect. If I were floating through space, or just placing it in a bag/purse, I'd want to be a little more sure the cap wasn't going to come off and get ink all over my million dollar space suit.The plastic case came to us broken, but I guess that's shipping to blame. Packaging the box in a soft envelope doesn't do much for protection though.As far as writing, so far so good. Smooth enough and doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary.If given the choice again, I probably wouldn't buy it, hence the two stars."
2,Not worth it for the price.,"It's a fine pen, but not as revolutionary as it would seem. I think it's overpriced.Editing to elaborate since most people were voting my review as not helpful: I purchased this wanting a pen that was small enough to keep on me all the time. This pen is too bulky for that. I also don't like the way that the clip slides off. What I found and liked better instead is a pen I can keep on my keychain from a company called True Utility. It telescopes to a nice size and is small enough to always carry."
2,"O.K. Pen, but not worth the cost.","In a nutshell, this pen has the same writing feel as regular ballpoint pen. Writing was smooth for the first few days, after that, it was just like a cheap ballpoint pen. I didn't use it in extreme condition or writing upside down, so I can't tell if it works as advertised or not. But for regular use, I think it has the same value as cheap ballpoint pens. The ""bullet"" design is sturdy and compact but the clip just keeps falling off."
1,Received an Empty Box,"You would think that at 18.11 dollars for a pen that they would have checked inside the box to see if it was actually in there before they sent it. Was going to be a gift for someone, and now I have to wait even longer for a replacement one. I hope they check in the box this time before they send it. Poor quality control i guess."
4,Best pen on the market,"Writes on anything, upside down, in any temperature and fits in a pocket without poking holes. Did not get 5 stars because of high price."
4,A Fun Portable Pen,"I've always wanted to own a space pen because of its science-fiction, cracker-jack box like appeal. Now that I finally have one, I have not been disappointed. As promised, it writes on all forms of surfaces and in all different positions. Additionally, the pen's smallness and sturdy design make it capable of being taken anywhere. However, at the same time it has a well-balanced feel. My only quipis that the ink occasionally blots when writing. Overall, I highly recommend it.Chrome Bullet Space Pen Gift Boxed"
4,Great Pen,I own one of these as well as the chrome bullet model. Great pen. It fits in a pocket perfectly and refils can be purchased at any office supply store or department store. I have had the black one for about 7 years and in places the finish has rubbed of revealing the brass underneath. Bear in mind I am in the military and my pen has been exposed to some pretty harsh conditions. I think with normal use the finish wearing off would not be a problem. It took about 4 years of daily carry and use for it to become noticeable.
5,This pen is like no other,"I've used a lot of pens in my life, but this one is by far the best. Not only is it a great pen, but it's also a great conversation piece. Last night, I took my space pen to the bar, bought a girl a drink, and then i whipped out my pen. I mentioned that it writes under water, through grease, upside down...you name it! Latter on, i used the pen to write down her telephone number! Without this pen, I'd still be single! Thank you space pen!"
2,I bought two about 1.5 years ago. One is fine. One is not.,I bought two of these about a year and half ago. One still works great. The other one now leaks all over the place with normal usage. Kind of a bummer -- your mileage may vary.
4,Niche Pen,"This pen filled a very specific need for me. If you're looking for a great writer, this isn't going to be a special pen. It writes like any five cent Bic ballpoint. This pen is great for me, because the job I work at I wear a name tag on a cord, and this pen clips on to the name tag, is fairly light and small, and allows me easy access. It's history is a fun talking point for customers as well."
3,Not worth the hefty price tag,I was searching for a small pen I could clip to my cell phone holder or to my work ID badge I wear on a lanyard around my neck that would be easily accessible and would write in all kinds of weather conditions. The size is ok but the clip keeps slipping off the end and continually removing and replacing the cap adds to the annoyance factor of something that should just work without having to fiddle with it. A much better design would be to have the clip built into the pen and to add a ring so that it could be attached to a keyring or carabiner clip to avoid loss. I could do without having a cap altogether and just have a click mechanism to extend and retract the point for writing.
5,Great Pen,I got this one for my grandfather and he loved it. This makes a great gift because it writes so smooth. It seems very well constructed and worth twice what it is selling for.
3,Expensive but useful,"This is the second of these pens that I have owned. (I lost the first one).They are nice and small to carry, especially for a guy without a purse. You can always have a pen with you in your pocket and it writes on almost anything.Also, it makes a great conversation piece. I have gotten the attention of many waitresses by showing them this pen! They all loved it! (None of them ever went out with me but I don't blame that on the pen). LOL"
2,Decent pen but Unsatisfied,"Was excited for the pen, loved the size and writing but somehow cap got stuck on the back. It's been two days and I haven't been able to get it off. I ended up slicing my hand, and scratching the whole pen. Stil havent gotten off. If I could return it I would. For a 20 dollar pen, you wouldn't expect something as stupid as this happening. Therefore, I would recommend this pen to someone. Disappointed with fisher for making such an inferior product. I guess its all about marketing. Trickery."
3,3.5 stars,"does not look like the pen in the picture. comes in a cheap plastic box, and foam shaped to look like the surface of the moon. much smaller than pictured too. Does work as promised. And comes with orderform for pen refils, and a history of the pen's invention."
3,"Good pen, Easy to loose","I must have lost twenty or more of these pens over the years. As a writing insterment it works well for what is is designed for, something small to keep in your pants pocket. But the design makes it easy to slip out of your pocket when seated. I have found that the ones with the clip and matte finish seem not to be as slick as the chrome ones and I tend to keep them longer. The matte finish does wear to a nice brassing like a old SLR camera, which I like. I keep waiting for my last pen to turn up since I find [...] shipping for something I loose every 6 months a little steep."
3,Beautiful but flawed,"I love the lock and feel of this pen. I have a real love for pens and this one is so great that it made me switch from a long preference for blue ink (ok, I know I am particular.)The one drawback, however, is a big one. The clip is not attached to the pen and came off so easily that it would fall off regulalrly. I almost lost it one day and had to crawl under a few desks in order to find it. When you are looking for a small, thin metal clip, it can be a challenge. I ended up using some super glue to attach it, but this ended up hurting the overall appearance of the pen. It still works and feels terrific, but I was disappointed that I had to go to such lengths with a pen that was certainly not inexpensive."
5,Great pen! Clip needs some work though.,"This is a great pen. Very smooth and ergonomic, fits into your pocket really well. If you intend on using the clip, you might want to put a bit of Locktite on the clip to keep it on; be sure to wipe off the excess."
3,Not built as well as my older pen.,Like the way the pen writes but the cap doesn't securley fit when closed. I ordered this one to replace the one I lost. I'm afraid this will be clipped to my pad and the pen will disengage from the top without me noticing until too late.
1,Very unimpressed :(,"I had high expectations. I needed a pen that that I could store along the spine of my moleskine notebook (the small one). The ink flow is inconsistent and smudges. The clip is not secured well, and I almost lost the pen twice before I gave up on using it. Aesthetically, it looks nice but just doesn't perform. Also, because the clip on the pen isn't located at the top of the pen, when clipped into my notebook, the pen protruded another half inch, sort of defeating the purpose of having a small pen.Instead, I have had great success with another pen, the Zebra Expandz. Although the ink flow isn't the best either, it is certainly much better than the Fisher Space pen. It expands to a full size pen, yet compresses to about 80% of the height of my 5"" moleskine notebook. The clip is at the very top of the pen, so the pen doesn't stick out past the notebook. A great combination, I would recommend the Zebra of the Fisher if your want to use it with a moleskine.[...]"
3,Don't buy the clip!,I love the pen but the clip fell off and was lost within 24 hours! Not worth the extra change to get the clip...stick with the original...free replacement clips for everyone please!!
4,Good Tool,"I bought this bit for a specific woodworking project I had going at the time. I own a number of Freud bits, (most of my router bits are Freud), and this one worked well.I've always had good luck with Freud bits."
4,exegesis into application,"Although not quite as full of theological explanations for Greek/Hebrew grammar this commentary bridges the gap between the outstandingly exellent Keener and the BST Green. As usual the bridging and application for each chapter is what makes this a worthwhile commentary to have. For technical exegesis Keener is by far the best of the more recent offerings, but for this combined with a thorough application Leon Morris is also very good. Ranking third would be NIV Wilkins; France is good on exegesis not so good on application and so NIV Wilkins comes just above this."
3,Disappointed,"Have given numerous listens and I guess Bruckner, at least this one...Since, just doesn't do it for me as a whole."
4,This was my gateway album!,If it was not for this album I would have never been introduced to the beautiful world of Richard Buckner.
5,Shake & Ache.,"A very beautiful record, full of lilt, twang, & whisper. Enough melody & pace to keep one bouncing obliviously through stark narratives of passion & despair. The occasional piano adds a level of depth, resonance, and even, I daresay, hope. I don't know if it's fun to be Richard Buckner, but it sure would be great if all melancholy were this constructive."
2,Seemingly well researched but terribly written,"This bio was compelling yet painful to read. Compelling in terms of subject (the life and times of Charles M.) but agonizing in terms of ""kicking back"" with a comfortable tome. The ""narrative"" consists of facts, statements and opinions being thrown at the reader without (generally) any context or follow-up. Characters and scenarios are brought up one moment and abruptly dropped the next. The book will occasionally read like a parody of Larry King's USA Today column! I highly recommend Brian Priestley's Mingus: A Critical Biography over this sophomoric effort."
2,"His self, though he's none too real","Mingus was mighty. And though Santoro introduces him with great praise and passion, he almost portrays him as a buffoon through his many contradictory phases. And for a music critic, his descriptions of the music and compositions is pretty awful (awkwardly described, incorrect or minus any true appreciation). A few more details about Mingus' personal life than Priestley's musical biography, but otherwise, Priestley's book is infinitely better!"
2,Let my children read competent prose,"Mingus, for all his many hideous transgressions depicted herein, deserves far better than to have this amateurish draft pass for a definitive biography. In short, this is a poorly conceived and written book, and I'm frankly shocked that Oxford would implement such low standards for any publication. I only added a second star because occasionally through the repetitive muck, superfluous attempts to link Mingus' exploits with banal depictions of broader cultural events, utterly failed stylizations, and absurd irrelevancies that clutter much of Santoro's text, I was able to glean further dimension of just how monumental an a-hole Mingus allowed himself to be. Since the predominant focus is on Mingus' personal life rather than his music, you almost can't help but come away with a sense more of disgust than reverie, regardless of the way Santoro consents to explain the eccentricities away by lapping up the bassist's transparently insecure claims to genius."
2,Research every opinion,"This book chronologically tells the story of the legendary bassist's life but this is no narrative. Santoro employs testimony from Mingus' bandmembers, ex-wives, kids and various folks in the know but I doubt any of these folks would dig how much of the book is based on Santoro's own opinions on Mingus' career choices and experiences which shaped his music. For example, the author wastes too many pages ruminating on interracial love, a topic he seems mildly disturbed by. I gave this book one extra star for the thorough discography to the rear of the book, but the book itself is utterly disposable."
4,Thanks for writing this book Mr. Santoro,"Was it David Sedaris (author of Me Talk Pretty One day) that said he won't date anyone who uses the word Zeitgeist? Too many times this word gets used in this book. I think this book still deserves to be read, especially along with _Beneath the underdog_ written by Mingus himself. I thought in terms of Jazz history, this book does better than _Miles_ for example. This kind of book is written out of love, and we should be thankful for Mr. Santoro's efforts. I did not know much about Mingus' life, and it gives me different insight into his world when I listen to his music now."
1,A major disappointment,"Extensive reporting but so poorly written! Given such an inspirational subject, the language fails miserably to rise to the occasion. This was surely a tough subject to tackle, but I think the author stopped a draft or two too soon. Though not by any means worthless, this is not an engaging read. ... I expected so much more from this book."
5,Mount Mingus Grows and Grows,"Like a mountain that seems to grow larger the further away you travel from it, so grows Charles Mingus--man, musician, composer, figure--as time passes. Clearly, as Santoro claims, he was one of the seminal figures in American music of the last fifty years. This book relentlessly places him is the context of the world swirling around him and captures the interactive relation between the energy that is history and the energy that was Mingus. Santoro's research seems exhaustive without ever exhausting the reader and his opinions of Mingus' music are right on (unlike that other biography, this one gets it that ""The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady"" is a major work in jazz history). All in all, an excellent opportunity for a Mingus neo-phyte to start seeing this hugely important figure for the giant he was and also for those, like me, who think of Charles as a mountain to see the intricate ledges and cliffs and long vistas even more clearly."
4,Mingus book review,"I am not a book reviewer by any means but when this book came out I got it from the library and read it up. The only other Mingus book I had read was his semi-autobiography ""Beneath the underdog"". Although it's a great title and all it was highly confusing to follow in a timeline. It's written in a very non linear style and then when some while later I saw Santoro's book I could'nt wait to read it. I found it far better of a jazz bio than some of the others I've read. I've read it a couple times and I would say it's well researched and gave me insight into aspects of the man,musician,composer and troubled angry genius that is Charles Mingus. I give it a thumbs up for sure."
1,Avoid,"This is a very bad book.If you are interested in the monthly payments Charles Mingus made on his car loan, this may be the book for you. If you are interested in Mingus' music, don't bother - Santoro has very little to say other than cliche."
3,"Great book, no thanks to Newfield","This is a great book, in that it tells a great story. However, Jack Newfield's writing style, which seems to ape Don Kings malapropisms even as it pokes fun at them, does not help the book at all. If you can get past the ridiculous sportswriter's vocabulary and eight-grade grammar, you're in for one of the most disturbing tales ever told. Particularly if you've ever spent any money at all on the boxing industry. The fact that Don King is as powerful as he is and is still at large says more about this country's legal system than any of the shenanigans of the man in the White House. This book represents a tale that absolutely had to be told at any cost. Its just too bad Jack Newfield was the one to tell it."
3,great movie from the book,"don't miss the movie made from the book, ""Don King, Only in America"", beatifully directed and edited, great dialogues, hard to believe they found an actor that can mimic Don King, an actor himself. Good to see this fictionalized movie, alog with the documentary ""When We Were Kings"" to compare how the scenes of really happened scenarios were recreated"
5,Synovi G3 Soft Chews,I've been using Synovi G3 Soft Chews for the past year and it's made an amazing difference in my two dogs. They have more energy. I highly recommend this product for your dog if he/she suffers from back and hip problems.
5,Synovi G3 Soft Chews,"I have an eleven year old schnauzer who started to have problems with his hip joints. I started giving him Synovi soft chews and they have helped him tremendously. He still has difficulty going up and down stairs and jumping, but this product has helped him a lot. I have a six year old schauzer also and he plays more than the younger one. I highly recommend this for any dog that is beginning to have joint problems."
2,Synovi Soft Chews,"This is the second time that I ordered this product. This order came in dry and crumbled very easily. The original order's product was moist and could be broken in half easily. The dog still eats it anyway, but it makes it hard to hide pills in it when it crumbles. Katie is 13 1/2 yrs. old and this really seems to help her stay active."
4,Synovi Chews,Our pug loves these chews-she gets 1/2 a tablet each morning an seems to like them almost more than her regular food! She's 12 years old and the vet recommended them to reduce arthritis pain. It works for her as well as my glucosamine works for me!!
5,great deal,this synovi was a great deal on line. the order came quickly & the price just couldn't be beat. will definitely order again!
4,SynovG3 Soft Chews,Ordered and received this product within five days! Was really surprised and very happy!
5,Good product!,I've been following the loading dose for my lab/golden cross who's 6 for just about a month now. He's had no problem tolerating the product and LOVES the flavor!
1,Not Good My Dog died from this stuff,Here I thought I was doing my older dog a favor with all the review I saw for this but I should of went to my vet who advised me that supplements like this are not really good for dogs becasue they are not regulated. They advised this stuff killed my dog so needless to say make sure you do talk with your vets before you even try to do any supplements. I wish there was better research posted on this stuff and not from what the company of the product says. The vet advised most comercials they give dogs drugs to make them lathargic and take videos and then when the dog comes out fo the drugged state that they are back to normal and they do video stating thsi is the dogs after we give them this stuff see how much better. Live and learn unfortunately it was at the cost of my best friend.
2,Not a Difference Maker,"My 125 lb. female German shepherd has arthritis and hip problems. Having said that, I've tried oodles of products, both from vets and private suppliers.This product didn't seem to make any difference at all for her. She enjoyed eating them, however, so the taste wasn't a problem. They just didn't help her. Each dog is different, so trial and error really is the only way to go. I have found some products that do work for her, but doubt this is the forum to extol them."
1,my 16 year old westie will not eat it,"After reading the reviews, I bought this product for my 16 year old westie. He will not eat it. But he would eat Joint Treats Minis. My other two 3 year old eat the Synovi G3 Soft chew and they had diarrhea."
5,New dog,I started giving this to my older dog and within a week she had more energy and was acting like a puppy again. Running around and being very playful It seems to really have helped her feel like her younger self again!
4,Synovi G3 chewables,"SynoviG3, 120 Soft ChewsWe have been using this product for about a year and see improvement in our dog's mobility."
4,Great product and a great price!,"My vet recommended this product for my 9 yr old golden retriever. She has bone cancer and is 3 weeks post amputation. Due to more stress now on 3 legs, I have been giving this to her everyday since. Vet charged $50 for this same product, yikes! My dog will not take it as a treat, so I have to break it up and put it in her food. She has no problems eating it now :) She seems to be less stiff and much more mobile."
4,Synovi,"It's only been a few weeks, but I do think I see an improvement in my lab. His arthritis set in and he had such difficulty getting up and down - but I give him 4 of these chews each day and he seems to be getting around better. I'm going to keep using it hopefully with continued results. I gave 4 stars only because it is a costly item BUT it is much cheaper on Amazon than from a local vet!"
5,Synovi G3 is a God send,"My dog literally was having trouble walking and Synovi saved her life! After 6 weeks of using it, she can walk again, almost like when she was young. Try it, it works!"
5,A Great relief for my buddy,"My best friend, Emmitt, a Labrador Retreiver, suffered an incredible trauma at age 8 months when a trespasser on our land hit him and broke both hips, pelvis and a compound fracture in his left rear leg. We thank God daily for the talents and care he received from Dr. Michael Newman of the Alabama Veterinary Surgery in Decatur, AL. Emmitt is now a happy 3 year old. Our regular Vet had prescribed Rimadyl for pain management, which did work for just that. Emmitt was still stiff and only walked around and occasionally breaking into a trot. But recently at Emmitt's regular visit to Dr. Young he recommended Synovi G3. It has been the most miraculous transformation we have ever seen. Emmitt has returned to running everywhere! He jumps and plays with his buddies and has become the old Emmitt we knew and hoped he would be again. No more Rimadyl for now."
4,Great supplement,The vet recommended this item as my 3-year old chihuahua has a slipping knee cap. Since he started taking this medicine (after about 3 days) -- it has not happened again.
4,lisathelibrarian,"I've used this product for over a year. It is very sturdy, and the cap stays on very well. You can easily delete the security software, or just not use it. It gives you the option of running the software each time you plug it in, but you can just choose not to use it. The only thing I don't like about it is that is sometimes too wide for the usb port space. It also works well on a usb 1.1 drive."
4,"Not the best, but good and reliable","I had my lexar jump drive for about 6 months, and I have *never* had any trouble with it (the only reason I no longer use it is that I recieved a larger 1GB unit for Xmas). This plucky little drive was always reliable and never any trouble. As for other reviewers' comments, I cannot image the abuse they must have put this thing through; I'm a biology grad student, and took this drive with me during fieldwork in Guam. I even accidentally left it in my pocket while out collecting snakes from the brush or testing them in the baking tropical sun.The only significant downside is that the drive is very chunky, and as a result it may have trouble fitting into USB ports surrounded by other equipment or even with adjacent USB ports in use."
3,Default partition type is FAT.,"This drive has a default partition as FAT when configured. The configuration software doesn't have provision to change the partition type. You will have to format(through OS) the drive then using FAT32/NTFS. And the total size is just 483 MB and not 512 MB... Just like all hard drives. Hard drives are acceptable, but Jump drives cannot be.The drive is pretty fast. And surely is handy."
2,Worked for a while,"When it worked, it did as described, but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost. Now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it. There are many better, more reliable brands, such as the Sony Micro Vault which I have now. Nevertheless I wouldn't put anything on these that I didn't have backed up. These drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer. Heat will cause them to fail faster."
4,Worthwhile but a little confusing,"I think that most of the other people using this item haven't been properly trained. While the documentation on the software is lacking, it does work quite well. I really only have 2 small problems with the Secure JumpDrive.1. You have to install the software on any machine you wish to access the ""Secure"" portion of the drive from. This isn't a big deal, this is just like saying you have you install WinZip(tm) or the like to use zip files.2. It's too sensitive to shock damage. After dropping the drive once to often I had to pry open the case and re-solder the timing crystal. While this wasn't a big deal it is probably more than most people want to deal with.All in all, I like the JumpDrive and the 256bit AES encryption is REALLY nice to have, but if you are going to get it, then be nice to it."
3,Lexar Jump Drive,"I like the style and look of this jump drive but sometimes it is a little too fat to fit in the back of some computers. The choice was unplug the keyboard to plug in the drive. I can work with it.There is no way to pull up the software to access the secure portion of the drive. The software comes up sporadically. I haven't been able to get into my secure drive for some time and I need to do a re-partition. Any suggestions?It is a drag to have to delete everything on the jump to re-partition so if I ever get the opportunity again, I will make my public drive much larger.Otherwise, I like it."
2,Broke in a month,"This product is not very good, in fact I had to throw it away and buy a new one from a different mfg.After a month of use I tried to resize the secure partion using the recommened methods and it failed. After several lengthy calls to tech support I realized the unit was not fixable so I hucked it in the trash can.Dont use their secure junk software and you'll probably be fine."
1,did not fit under the KidKraft train table that I ordered,On amazon this said that it went with the KidKraft train table I ordered but it doesn't come close to fitting under then table. It looks like a nice drawer but the whole point was for it to roll UNDER the table!
5,Good companion option for train table with a few comments,"We purchased two of these to match a train table. The drawer was very good quality and relatively easy to assemble. While two of these fit with a little (very little ) room to spare below the train table, one would have been plenty of storage because they are huge. The instructions said that two of the four wheels were supposed to be fixed, but all four wheels we received were swivel style - which makes the drawers a little harder to move. One thing that was impressive is that the sides and bottom were all made of reasonably thick 5/8"" woodgrain particle board with vinyl trimmed edges. The drawers are durable and you do not have to worry about them breaking if your child decides to crawl inside of one. Overall, a good value as usual from Amazon with free delivery to my doorstep in less than 1 week."
4,Thinking about ordering - is it one or two drawers?,"I am just wondering if you get two drawers when you order or if this is the price per drawer (so you'd need to order two?) Also, the dimensions are throwing me off a bit, I know some people said it didn't fit their table, is there another size kidkraft train table? I guess I'll measure again but the product dimensions seem too big to be just a single drawer...I gave it a high rating since its exactly what I need!"
2,"Wacky Predictions from the World of ""Pastor Russell""","If you like to read weird, non-scholarly theological works, this author is second only to Joseph Smith. Russell comes in second because he never claimed that an angel gave him his context-busting, theological speculations. Now, his replacement as the President of the Watchtower Society, J. F. Rutherford did claim to get his ramblings from angels. However, he also claimed that God Almighty lives in the Pleiades star system! LOL"
5,exactly what I expected,Just received the love knot braclet. It is a beautiful piece and very well crafted. Just as advertised. I am very happy with my purchase!
4,Need the attention of 20 five year olds?,"My Nose is a Hose as well as the rest of the Salisbury pop-up series are miraculously magical in the eyes of the Kinder set. Great for rhyming and word family lessons. They will want to see these books again and again. The illustrations are computer generated; simple, and uncomplicated. There will be no Caldecott Award won here, however, the children will not get confused by the pictures. A fun book for one or many 3-5 year olds."
5,Amazing book!,"This book is an engaging, amazing testimony of how God used an ordinary woman to do great things for the kingdom of God!"
2,"Book lack punch, but perhaps it is because of the time in which it was written.",I have read two other books about Gladys Aylward and enjoyed them. It is hard to write a negative review as this is actually written by her. However I felt that her time in China was almost downplayed even though it was 20 years! I have read that there were things in the movie Inn of the Sixth Happiness Gladys was not pleased with so felt perhaps she chose to not engage the topic to a great extent in her book.
3,A Little More,"This book didn't quite tell enough. It's the autobiography of Aylward, a Christian missionary to China starting in the 1930s. While the pacing and narrative voice are fine, I kept wanting to read more. Her life is truly unique and I would not mind reading hundreds of detailed pages covering what the Russian winter was like with no heat or clothes, what trekking across the Chinese mountains for weeks with barefoot children was like on her body and mind, and especially the joy she must have felt when a prayer is at last finally answered as only God can do. While we get glimpses, she does not go into much detail. I never feel like I am there in China with her, cooking soup for the traders or hiding in a cave from the Japanese soldiers. I feel like she is giving a speech, bothering only to tell the highlights. Her story is definitely inspiring, although many of the conversion stories are almost unbelievable. Like her adventures, they are not detailed enough."
5,The Life of an Amazing Woman!,"What an amazing life Gladys Aylward led, as she went to China by train, via Russia, with only a few dollars in her pocket. Her faith in God strengthened her to be gutsy--willing to try anything to reach the Chinese people. This book is WAY better than the glamourized movie of her life, ""Inn of the 6th Happiness."""
3,Make sure your computer is compatible!,"After reading all the favorable reviews, my 11 yr old son decided to spend his saved up allowance to purchase this video game maker. Once it arrived in the mail, we rushed to install it on the computer only to discover the drivers on our about 3 yr old standard ""home"" computer drivers and some other technicalities weren't adequate to support the game. However, we did take it to a relative's house and installed it there and my son LOVED it! He found it easy to navigate and produce, and really appreciated the ability to burn to a disk."
2,"If this is the gold edition, I'd hate to see regular","I don't like this one much. Maybe I was hoping for something more. Maybe the learning curve is too much.Or maybe I've spent too many hours building Duke Nukem levels?I was hoping to get some game knowledge out of this. How to st them up, sizing & things of that nature. The instructions are there, just not geared for a neophyte.It's cheap enough to buy & try, but save up & try one of the other ones. Or a book. Not only did I get frustrated with it, I got bored.I may putz around with it again some day, but it's not on my list right now."
3,Man's Drama,This is recommended for someone who likes man's drama behind the scene rather than fighting scene. funny and furious.
4,smaller than i expected,"I like the cryptex, but it is a bit small and the rings with the letters move out of their place too easly."
3,the book was better,"as an avid reader the book was great, but the movie was lacking. The female lead was dependant upon the male lead and made her character seem weak, whareas in my opinion, the book portrayed her stronger."
3,Predictable surprise,"Although this book came highly recommended, I have had trouble finishing it. The heroine is boring, and the hero is none too bright. The suspense is boring, and the romance at fizzle, rather than sizzle. There is a surprise ending, but it is really very predictable."
1,Booooring,"*CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS*This book had next-to-no action. The mystery was tedious, the romance was lukewarm, and the outcome was predictable. The worst part, however, is the fact that we're supposed to believe that the male protagonist, who was a good cop before he became a successful crime writer, knew the killer intimately for several years and never once considered that she was a suspect simply because she was female. Very asinine..If you're still interested in reading the story, I suggest you save your money and get it at the library."
1,Buyer beware,"I ordered this item on Dec. 13. It was supposed to arrive by no later than Dec. 23. On Dec. 26th, I received an empty cardboard tube (which doesn't seem big enough for the item to fit into). I contacted the seller twice, on 1/3 and 1/8, and have received no response as of today (1/13). I am now having to file a claim through Amazon."
5,The best of it's kind on the market..,"I've tried a few different Omega 3-6-9 brands, but this is the real deal! It helps my arthritis & skin!"
4,Great fun,An extraordinarily good movie experience. I watched it in French with subtitles and thoroughly enjoyed it. Luc Beeson rocks!
3,Entertaining but a little slow paced,"Good film based on the graphic novel series. Entertaining and funny in parts, pacing a little slow at times. If you are a fan of action comedy, it's OK a little light on action though."
4,Very Enjoyable!,"After seeing this film, I find myself wondering why there wasn't a wider release in the US. It's an incredibly creative story. Louise Bourgoin is outstanding as Adele Blanc-sec, a fast talking, quick witted adventurer/archaeologist. It had some rather campy CGI in it, but it was easily ignorable. This particular edition had a few typos in the subtitles, but other than that, I enjoyed this immensely."
5,PERFECT TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!,This toy is just so cool and realistic so just get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Eberron Campaign Setting,"The Eberron Campaign Setting is a fantastic new world brought to us from Wizards of the Coast. It is the first setting to be created and published with the new v3.5 rule set, and as thus has been made to easily integrate all of their published sources.There is a place for everything in Eberron!Some people have been disappointed with the setting, but personally, having spent a great deal of time with Greyhawk/Forgotten Realms, it's a delightful departure from 'generic fantasy' RPG settings. And it's made to use all the rules!All in all, it's a fantastic book and gets 5/5 from me. I look forward to picking up more Eberron sourcebooks."
4,"Eberron is what D&D needs, not the typical romance fantasy","Eberron enlightened me on many aspects of Dungeons and Dragons. In this campaign setting manual, the various authors take Baker's Idea of a mysterious dark world recently changed by a ""Last War"", and puts it down into a playable fun format. This manual consists of a few new races (which are acutally really balanced) and a new character class. Look forward to tons of new feats(some of which are race specific) new spells, new equipment and material, and a history of Eberron that is playable and fun.Keith Baker who also has written a few novels about Eberron has found a way to create a world that is largely dependent on magic; so much that magic is inherited by certain bloodlines and bound to objects almost making a kind of magic technology and he has successfully mingled psionics into the campaign.I recomend this setting to all D&D; fans."
5,Great Product! Refreshingly New,"I bought this book with great trepidation, all I can say is that I am glad that I did. From the chapter layout to campaign pointers this book is above and beyond what I expected. The new content is original and long past due. Really the only thing upsetting about this product line to me is how long I have to wait for new stuff to come out."
4,I love it,"This book is great, it is everything I wanted it to be. There was one fellow that said that it wasn't as polished and didn't have good legendary characters, and this is because it was designed to make the Player Characters stand out even more.The only gripe that I have is the maps lack much detail. They give good generalizations, but don't really carry through on them.Overall, this is a great book about a great world that the PC's can shape with their actions. If you love D&D and would like a fresh look at things, then pick this up...NOW!!"
2,Dungeon's and Dragon's Eberron Campagn Setting,This is a great expansion of the D&D rules for creating your own campaigns within the Eberron setting. However the description I read led me to believe it was a pre-made campaign ready to run with little or no preparation.
3,Decent,"While this book isn't as good as the Forgoten Realm Setting, it's interesting. It has some compeling concepts for new races and character types. Also, it throws in some new angles on old races.However, even though this book has some new ideas, it's main problem is that is lacks real depth. It is not as polished as Forgoten Realms, and doesn't provide the same background (such as lengendary characters, detailed history or a real flavor for the various lands.)One of the more disappointing aspects of the book is it's maps. They aren't nearly detailed enough, especially the larger maps.Bottom line: I'd give this book 3.5 stars. Fresh concepts, decent art, good layout, but mediocre maps and limited depth."
5,A suprising instalment,"When I first hear of Ebberon, I found the idea almost repulsive, it seemed like an attempt to blend D20 Modern and D&D together, not a good idea. However, the book was given to me as a gift, and after a few hours steady reading, I was nicely suprised. While I doubt I'll ever play this campagn setting, it is full of exelent ideas which can be applied to add variety to an existing campagn in anywhere from tiny to massive doese (example, from action points to the lightning rail and the war forged.). While I dont really like the prestige classes, they are not actualy bad, and some of the new races (warforged, changelings) are not only original but epertly crafted and perfectly playable. So, even though pulp fantasy may not be your genre, this book can still be very useful and inspirational, and I highly recomend it."
4,great sturdy kids desk,"this desk is very sturdy and functional. i like that the chair is not attached, so we can use that at the kids tables and for other things. there are places to store pens/markers. and lots of little compartments and other sotrage for papers and art supplies. you can lift up the writing desk to store papers and writing utensils. the light is pretty weak and requires too many batteries, so we don't use that. as far as desks go, this is a great one for the money. my kids don't like to sit at desks, so it doesn't get as much use as we thought."
1,Confused,"Sub-par product.On a sidenote, does anyone know what the hotkey combination for this device is, if there even is one? It doesn't even have a manufacturer's website."
5,redemption and forgiveness..,"I love this!! Only a true story of how God moved on the lives of this family could enable more to believe and trust God. I was overwhelmed at the forgiveness that took place in the boys life,only to see the father give in to his conviction. To top it off I have heard Josh on the radio for years and had never heard his story before!!This encourages me just as God would have us do. This world is full of people hurting..who need forgiveness!! Millie Johnson"
5,solid ps2 (slim version) case,"fits the slim ps2, controllers and wires. keeps everthing together in a cool looking metal case"
1,Pro Gamers Case for Slim PS2!!,"Ordered this item and had to send it back - it is for the slim PS2, not the original PS2. Wish they would have mentioned that!"
3,Not McCarthy's best...,"I am an alum of the small college ""Groves"" is based on. I am also an academic and great fan of McCarthy's novel ""The Group"". I should have found ""The Groves of Academe"" engaging on these three facts alone. Sadly, the book left me cold. As a satire the novel is dissatisfying on several levels -- where we spot the familiar, the recognition is only sad, not humourous; and the plot, even for an academic who can be expected to find campus politics interesting, is deadly dull. If you aren't familiar with McCarthy, start with her far more interesting and accessible ""The Group"" instead. If you are new to academic satire, start with ""The Lecturer's Tale"" for a far more entertaining and cunning critique of academic culture."
3,lacks nuance,"This book gave me the same desire I sometimes have at an art gallery, to touch up someone else's painting; not that it's not a good painting, but if I were painting it...Anyway, this work will amuse those deep in the belly of the academic beast, but knowing that they would be her audience, why did the author spend so much time explaining the minutiae of life at a small college? A reference here and there would have been sharper. If you haven't yet read Kingsley Amis's _Lucky Jim_, start there, and leave this for later."
4,Chuck's Review,Nice feel and nice fit for the price. Comes out of the dryer in good shape and ready to wear.
4,What You See is What You Get,"Very comfortable and roomy, as usual. It is larger than what I can wear but I am self conscious about my weight, it is perfect. I like the color, just as pictured. And I like the fact that Outerbanks makes their shirts on the large size. It's good for people like me.The company/distributor has a fast ready for UPS pick up time. It got here earlier than Amazon predicted. I like that."
1,Shipping is slow.,"I purchased the item on December 19, and I still have not received it. It has now been 16 days since date of purchase and counting."
5,Great for bigger kids,"Most wheelbarrows out there are too small for ""big kids"". This one is big enough for my 7-year-old and its sturdy construction has been put to the test. He loves it."
5,Great buy,My two year old son likes this; but it will require some growing into. It's probably a bit large for a two year old. Well built; and looks just like Dad's version.
1,Wheelbarrow Packed in Toilet Paper Box!,"This wheelbarrow arrived in my front door in a toilet paper box! And the side of the wheelbarrow was sticking out of the box since the box was too small for it! I bought this wheelbarrow as a gift for my son's 5th birthday. How am I going to present it as a gift in this kind of packaging? Mind you, I bought this item new, not used. Shouldn't it at least have its original packaging??? All I can say is that I am very disappointed..."
3,No Packaging...,"While the wheelbarrow may be a winner, the packaging was NOT. I ordered two of these for Christmas presents for two grandchildren. They were shipped without any packaging around them at all. Not even shrink-wrap. The delivery man all but handed the gift to the child at the door. Come on, Seymore Mfg. It's Christmas. Wrap those gifts in something! Mary"
3,'Fears' Is Pretty Tame Stuff,"House Of Fears is a very tame and cookie-cutter horror movie. It's like a feature-length episode of Goosebumps. It's about a haunted house attraction called House of Fears that can bring your worst fears to life. Only it's not supposed to be real. Unfortunately, for a group of good-looking teenagers it's more real than they anticipated.'Fears' is the perfect movie for teenage girls to watch while having a sleepover. It's not gory or violent, and there isn't any sex and nudity. It's all very generic, bump in the night kind of stuff. I'm giving it 3 stars because any movie that has both an evil clown and an evil scarecrow can't be all bad. I just wish there was something in House Of Fears that could scare adults, and not just their nieces and nephews."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"House of Fears was a pretty cool premise, but the movie was destroyed by a lame script and a cast that just wasn't very good. Some kids at a party decide to break into a haunted house exhibit, when suddenly their fears all come to life. It sounds like a good movie and that cover is great, but the story seemed to be written by a fourth grader. If you're over the age of ten and this film actually scared you, you should be ashamed of yourself. This is seriously about one step above Goosebumps. Aside from the childish script, the acting here is a complete joke! Muffled lines, fake screams, no emotion, I could go on all night about what was wrong with the acting in this film! It's got an awesome cover and very well written description, but the truth is this film is nothing but a waste of time, that you might find mildly entertaining, just because of how bad it really is."
2,wasted potential,"This movie had a lot of potential but it just didn't live up to it. The death scenes were extremely quick with zero gore. And they didn't even try to give it any kind of suspense or any element of psychological terror.The plot, lighting, camera work and sets were all great. And all the actor did a great job. The only one I had a problem with was the black guy, and it wasn't so much the actor as it was the character. He just never shut up, he was constintly whining about everything."
4,Lots of good ideas to be gleaned; a few misguided,"Decent book, not quite up to par with Aslett's best books. Plenty of good ideas for minimizing overhead at work and concentrating on the ""real"" task that needs to get done. I take some exception at his recommendations to work evenings and weekends when needed - I think most purchasers of the book want to simplify their work life so they can get out of the office on time and enjoy the rest of their life. i.e. working overtime is one of the biggest components of a *non-simple* work life."
3,okay but not that useful,With 500 tips I have to admit that I found some good ideas but I didn't like the book. Whether he meant to or not Aslett comes off as that guy everyone in the office can't stand. Some of his ideas simply don't stand up to workplace reality and others were clearly written by a guy who hasn't sat in a cubicle in many years.
4,Wow...look at it go!,I run a daycare and the children fell in love with this toy. My grandkids came over and spent several hours showing and letting the younger children stomp on the pad to set the rocket off. They do go high and far and the children loved every minute of shooting them and running after them. A great toy!!
4,Pretty cool,"Very exciting toy, my only complaint is that the rockets are not that durable, so make sure this toy is for at least a 5 year old who won't try to eat it"
3,Fun! But not very durable.,This casing of the pump part broke after the second use...but it was awesome up until then. Enjoyed by the whole family.
5,Very cool toy,"Kind of reminds me of something from my childhood. The little ones loved this. (I think they had more fun jumping on the launcher) Just be aware, the tail fins on the ""rockets"" come off easily, so have some crazy glue or a hot glue gun handy! Amazon has the coolest stuff and terrific prices. Its why I did most of my Christmas shopping here!!! Thanks, Bob C."
3,cheep,"well, you get what you pay for... this isnt at all a durable product. its structural base parts are flexable foam... the rockets dont shoot very high... deffinitely not a giftable item."
3,A blast,The kids love this! I would order extra rockets. If they are on to tight they rip when they blast off. Kids need to be about 45 lbs plus to have they right weight to pop it. My kids now check the wind direction before send off! It won't fly as high as they claim!
3,Lots of fun until it breaks!,This toy is a blast until it falls apart. We are on our third and last one this year.
4,All-ages fun.,"I bought this for a friend's little boy. He, a five-year-old, and I, a 20-something-year-old man, both had a blast seeing how high we could shoot the darts, and trying to catch them on their way back to earth."
5,A lot of fun!,My son loves this toy. We take it to the park and all of the kids end up taking turns playing with this rocket. It's a fun toy for all ages.
4,An appropriate flying toy for children,"This is definitely the flying toy I would recommend getting for the students to play with. It's durable and economical and if I could pick only 1 flight toy for my kids to play with, it would be this one."
2,great fun - until it breaks,"This kit was a lot of fun, but the launch case cracked within an hour. The design of the launch case is as follows: a half-ball (rubber?) sealed to a hard plastic flat base. The base cracked, so the air now leaks out of the crack instead of pushing up the rocket. Also, the advertisement that the rockets go ""300 feet"" is NOT 300 feet in height. Perhaps 300 feet in total distance travelled - 140 up and 140 down and 20 across (which I still doubt)."
4,Great fun for the whole family,Very fun toy.All the family enjoyed and it was also a safe product.We also love the fact that you can purchase more rockets.
4,fun,the nephews loved it! got call from both sets of parents saying how much fun they were having with it!
5,Great Show!!,I always watched Hawaiian Eye and I thought it was great! I considered it as one of the best TV shows of the time.
4,great overall defense-stick,A great light-weight defenseman shaft. Extremely light and monuverable. Awesome for highlight-reel worthy rap checks.
2,A Compelling Trifle,"A compelling trifle for the fan of either the TV series, Friday the 13th or the actress Louise Robey. Recommended for completists of either of these schools -- Robey is as lovely as ever, and given the opportunity to expose both acting chops and skin. However, if you are not a fan of this actress, then I would not recommend it -- except for her, it is a rather bare-bones, predictable, tepid serial-killer yarn."
3,For Robey fans,"everyone is right, kind of a stupid slow movie. However, if you are a Louise Robey fan, its a must have!"
1,Office Depot's defective punch,"This poorly manufactured product, imported from China, is nearly useless. I bought one over a year ago and had to throw it away since the punch and hole weren't properly aligned. Then I took a chance on a second one lately since that's usually the only punch most local stores carry around here. An unfortunate choice: the second punch had the same misalignment problem & couldn't cut a round hole in even one sheet of paper; it cut a partial hole, which got caught in the metal reservoir and caused the paper to rip. Office Depot needs to get a better manufacturer, perhaps in the US!"
4,"NOT GREAT, BUT BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAD","The Danco components appear to be well made and durable. Unfortunately in our case, we were replacing Price Pfister faucets which might have been as much as 50 years old and the new valves were longer than the old valves, so the new handles extend beyond the trim pieces a bit too much. Not a performance issue, strictly cosmetic.If you are wondering why I didn't just use the new trim and handles with the old valves, it was because the old valves were too short to reach the new handles."
1,Don't by this edition,"Do not buy this DVD edition. Neither movie was digitally remastered as advertised, nor is the advertised bonus material on the DVD. The films look terrible, old prints dumped straight to DVD. The sound is equally bad. I am refering to the ""Triton Video"" edition that contains both Beat the Devil and That Uncertain Feeling. These are great movies that deserve better than than this poor quality DVD."
4,"NOTE: ""Blatant rip-off"" review refers to other version!","I just want to clarify that the customer review of ""That Uncertain Feeling"" with a subject: Blatant rip-off, seems to be referring to the ""Beat the Devil/That Uncertain Feeling"" double feature DVD (ASIN: B00003ETNA) since both films are mentioned in the review.The DVD that I reviewed is NOT this double-feature version, but the single-title release of ""That Uncertain Feeling"" by the Roan Group (ASIN: B00003RQNX).I am confident that the Roan Group's release of the film is indeed from a restored 35mm print -- the quality is just too good not to be!"
2,Beat the Devil,"I didn't like this movie, very disappointed and I love Bogart movies.That''s my comment on this movie. Thanks."
4,Motivating,"I found this book to be honest about fundraising, motivating and with great ideas and experience to further the business of fundraising"
2,Getting rather dated,"Considered a hit in the 1990s with Europeans, the audience for which this book was written. That was when Europeans knew little about true philanthropy and nothing about major donor relations. They were mostly wedded to direct mail and low-end funders. The author was a significant force in lower-end donor direct mail fundraising. Thus, little was ever of true significance for US and Canadian professionals. Considering the total absence of discussion of the phenomenal advances made with online communications linked to CRMs and participatory online membership activities for nonprofits, which are developing real relationships between nonprofits and their constituents, I doubt the value of this rather quaintly old fashioned book."
1,Recycled mess,This book is simply a collection of clips from old magazines and books. It is not particularly well organized or useful.
3,A Sleeper!,This movie was OUT OF PRINT when I purchased it from a third party [ORDER FULFILLED BY AMAZON]. I paid what amounted to a RENTAL FEE for a USED copy and enjoyed the movie! The acting was more than adequate. The storyline was as believeable as THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. I never heard of it when it was released which may be why it was overlooked!
3,it's alright,"You have to rent this knowing that it's a low budget disaster flick.Because there is nothing special about the effects.I think I can do a better job with Adobe- LoLBut it still isn't as bad as you may think.The acting is ok and lets face it, no garners interest in this filmbecause of acting. They want to see the disaster take shape and Ibelieve they do a good job showcasing that. It is more like a low3 instead of a high 2 so I'll give it 3 stars. Really, it's notbad, I was entertained to a certain degree. Definitely not a must-seebut more like a tv movie when nothing else is on."
1,The Name Says It All...,"If the Producers and Actors came foreward and exclaimed that this movie was a hoax, a saterical jab at ""Drive-In Movie"" movies and/or a teaching guide of what to avoid in making modern films. Really... Was this film a bad joke?"
3,"Actually, pretty decent once you get past the title","OK, the science is nonsense. And winds at absolute zero? Winds=friction=heat, so nonsense. Still, it's nice to see Jeff Fahey (an amazing actor; note how different he is, vocally, posture, etc., from his role on The Lost). ""Science is always right"" he says. Nope. One could argue the opposite. Still and all, the script is very good, with some great lines, and there's lots of action. The FX aren't up to Day After Tomorrow, but aren't totally hokey. It's a B movie, but a good B movie, and definitely not a D movie (like Sunshine!). For the price, a real bargain, and a great addition to your disaster film library.One little oddity: I guess the script called for Fahey's character to be David Koch, and the DVD case repeats this. But everyone calls him David Kotchman (or Kotzman)."
1,Misrepresents science,"This is a really low grade movie - I only bought it because the hero has the same name as my brother. The copy I received had intermittent sound and picture, so it wasn't even easy to watch (subtitles enabled me to get through it). It sadly reinforces many common misconceptions of science and scientists - such as ""science is never wrong"". Don't waste your time."
3,No more yelling!,"I bought this movie because I LOVE disaster movies. I liked the special effects (although a little brief), I liked the idea of the problem.The acting, however, was a little...missing. Jeff Fahey's idea of acting is doing a LOT of yelling, deserved or not. The death of one of the characters wasn't taken seriously (no, I won't say who it was), and the Jerk didn't get his due in a timely fashion.I enjoyed watching it, but it is a typical B movie. I don't know I'd watch it again, but I might have the flu someday. :)"
5,Good Hopper,"Simple, cheap, and sturdy. Gets the job done for my 98, needed it as a replacement since my last one broke."
4,"great, on time, good condition..... but not a tippman hopper....",its great new conditional all that everything's working fine. still jams(don't load paint balls) every time but that's usual with every hopper. Came on time. only concern was that its not a tippman hopper. its a gen x global. witch don't bother me that much i payed cheep. so i didn't get exactly what i wanted. but they should be more SPECIFIC like as the pictures or at-lest the title of the item. but no difference. just not all satisfied with the professionalism.
4,One Thing Missing But Great!!,Over all its amazing its holds a little more over 200 (ive been able to fit like 202) and it was a nice open system only complaint is that this has no lock or anything so i cant lock it onto my gun so its fallen off a couple of times
3,"Good quality, simple, what i expected!","This paintball hopper by Tippmann is worth the price I payed which is aprox. $4 . I received it in the time that was promised and it was in good condition. I wish the lid was a bit more clear but besides that its great. As far as gravity fed hoppers go this is probably the best, good quality, good packaging, sturdy plastic structure. The reason i gave it a 3 is because even though it is probable the best gravity hopper for what your paying, it is still only a gravity fed so it isnt near the best in the HOPPER category"
3,practical book,Nice book from the eighties. In this book they transform old patterns in new patterns for cross-stitch embroidery. The patterns are simple.
3,can i get a witness?,"nine years after michel'le burst onto the scene proclaiming herself to be 100% woman, she's back and as ""nicety"" as ever. ""hung jury"" has a darker, less optimistic feel than her self-titled debut which, along with the album's use of jurisprudence, leads one to believe michel'le's lived through at least some of what she's singing about. for the most part, though, ""hung jury"" sounds a lot like ""mo'hogany"" (monifah), ""soul of a woman"" (kelly price) and ""reality"" (smooth). while michel'le has not lost her smooth sensuality, listeners are not graced with any show-stopping wailing ala ""silly love songs"", ""if"" or ""no more lies"". we're very lucky to have michel'le, the woman, back, but i can't wait for the return of michel'le the diva."
3,Hung jury review,"Hung jury is ok but, its not good as a follow up to the first album which is in titled Miche'le which is a classic!!!!"
2,if only she did'nt take 10 years to put this out,only deathrow fans will remember this if this would have been released around 93 to 95 it might have sold some units but around this time suge was in jail and dre was long gone do anybody know that michel'le is now married to suge knight ironic is'nt it.
5,The Vanity Murders,"If this is a first book, I look forward to reading more from this author. She kept me guessing until the very end. I particularly enjoyed the moral aspect at the conclusion. The two inspector characters were very warm and interesting. Hope she uses them in her future writings. She is at the start of a new career."
5,GREAT!!! I passed the first time. This guy is great.,"The writing was clear and easy to understand. I can really fly that baby now, (and with no visibility). If you're looking to pass easily you MUST buy this one, its GREAT!!!!!"
3,A little gem,"On the face of it Delta Heat seems sort of weak, but once you get past a silly plotline, you'll find that it's a lot of fun. A cop from L.A. is murdered while working undercover in New Orleans. His partner (Anthony Edwards) arrives and launches an investigation, and along the way is partnered with a former N.O. cop named Jackson Rivers (Lance Henriksen). Once the two click, the story really takes on some life, and the byplay between them will have you grinning.The feel of the film is absolutely Nawlins and the peripheral characters nearly steal the show. Nearly. I doubt anyone could wrest this film away from Henriksen, especially after the scene where he gets caught on the doorjamb. What am I talking about? You'll see.If you like your cop flicks with some tartly comedic overtones, and you don't take it all too seriously, you'll probably like Delta Heat."
3,Good popcorn movie,"This is a great movie..u can laugh with it and just plain sit back with a bucket or bag of popcorn and just enjoy it. It's certainly not the greatest odd partner cop movie but well worth watching, especially if ur a Lance Hienrickson fan."
5,An Interesting Rogue,"This book captivated me! Its many characters, locations, and emotions swept me away into an era of mint juleps, magnolias blooming, and the unspeakable tension in the air of the South. It plays human emotion like a grand piano. In this book, friendship is based on what you don't know about other people. Love is not an emotion but an arrangement between persons of indifferent character. This book is for anyone interested in the smoldering taboos of the old South. A good read!"
5,"A great recording, a great story","Mark Knopfler new album is, in a word, excellent. The entire album is a pleasure to hear and the quality of the recording is excellent. My copy is encoded in HDCD - I may just try and get an HDCD player to take advantage of the superior format.The title track 'Sailing to Philadelphia' is about Mason & Dixon sailing up the Delaware River to Philadelphia to begin their trek to chart the Mason-Dixon line. When hearing the song I think about what a journey it must have been for two very different individuals to venture out into the unknown wilderness to survey a border. What an adventure it must have been!Highly recommended."
2,"Not awful, just undistinguished","To date, Mark Knopfler's work is the only music that I felt comfortable buying sight unseen. No more. Unlike ""Golden Heart"", ""Sailing to Philadelphia"" is boring. The songs aren't bad, but they're like tepid watercolors in a hotel room. They don't offend, but ten minutes after hearing them, they're hard to recall. The best tracks are ""What it is"" and ""Speedway at Nazareth"", but two good songs aren't reason enough to buy this CD."
3,The whole is less than the sum of it's parts,"Exactly who is Mark Knopfler? Is he a rock guitar icon? Is he a folk singer? It's hard to tell, based on his musical output. What's certain is that he has a wide range of musical interests and diversity of style is one of the first things you notice about ""Sailing to Philadelphia"". Each of the 13 songs exists in it's own little world, unrelated to what's around it. This is both a strength and a weakness. While the album certainly doesn't suffer from the sameness that so many other discs do, it is also certain that among all of these genres everyone will find something they do not like. The overall mood is quiet and no card is overplayed. This is a collection of good songs. I'm just not sure it coalesces into a fully satisfying album. You might say the whole is less than the sum of it's parts."
5,While on the Road to ...,"Deep in the bowels of Germany, I found myself without any tolerable distractions for my four hour ride. I stopped at a gas station and picked up Mark Knopfler's new cassette(it was a rental car, OK!!) By the second time around I was a ""Junkie doll"" I've not followed Dire Straits too closely, but have enjoyed some of their work. I also bought U2's new cassette, since they won best album of the year... What a joke! This is the best I've heard in a long time. The music really is stirring, but I'm more intrigued by the lyrics. It's really touching. The images of ""One More Matinee"" are absolutely rich and deeply moving. All of the songs are impacting in one way or another. I certainly got my money's worth. In fact, I'll search back on his other releases.... Yes... It's that good!Thanks Mark!"
5,Arriving in Philly,"When Mark Knopfler arrived in circa late 70s, maybe 80, I thought his breakout album extraordinary. This album contains what is arguably his best single, ""What it is"". Haunting, lyrical, beautiful, inviting. Alone, this one cut is worth purchasing.But, there is James Taylor's melodic voice on Sailing to Philly, and later Van Morrison helping out.Twenty some years after Dire Straits burst on the scene, this is one of the best albums to listen to when the mood is low key, the snow is falling at a rate of one inch an hour or you are in need of solace."
4,song missing,"Once again, Mark Knopler spellbounds us with his magic guitar work and strong texts. But this edition of the album (US release?) only deserves 4 stars, because a song is missing! I would suggest all Mark Knopler fans to buy the UK edition of this album (available on www.amazon.co.uk) where you get song number 14: ""One more matinee"""
5,can't stop listening,"In 1978 'Sultans of Swing' came on the radio in my car and I was blown away. 'What It Is' had the same affect as I was driving home from the record store listening to this CD for the first time. It's hard to say how much radio play this album will get, but there are at least three songs that deserve to be heard by anyone who appreciates good music - 'What It Is', 'Sailing to Philadelphia', and 'Speedway at Nazareth'. 'Do America' is a very lame song - the only one I would for sure ax, but not enough to take away a star. 'Who's Your Baby Now' is marginal, but growing on me. The rest are good to excellent, with a variety of sounds and styles. Normally I don't like to listen to any CD twice in a row, but I've probably listened to this entire CD 30 or more times, and I'm not ready to put it away yet. Treat yourself to an early Christmas gift. Buy this CD."
2,When I first heard...,"When I first heard Van Morrison butchering beautiful Irish songs with the Chieftans I was driving. I ejected the tape and in a safe manner threw it out the window. I never litter, I felt bad about it. Luckily I listened to Sailing to Philadelphia in my office in Philadelphia and only had to put it back into the box and throw it in the trash can. It was that awful. I cannot believe all the 5 star reviews. Could anyone involved in this album have broken a sweat while making it?"
2,4 good MK songs without Dire Straits,"Shangri La had some great songs but this I'm pretty sure theonly good song is What It Is. I will review 4 of my favorite MarkKnopfler songs without Dire Straits.BOOM, LIKE THAT good song, one of my favorite guitar solo songsit is also about fast food too that you see everywhereCOYOTE my personal favorite from mark knopfler, this is calledthe desert song and it rocks greatIMELDA great hard rock song with great riff rock ending.WHAT IT IS called the scotland song this is one of my favoritesfrom him, great job MK.DIRE STRAITS MARK KNOPFLER ARE THE BEST BAND EVER!"
4,Sail on!,"A new and thoroughly beautiful album from Mark Knopfler,who is in a class so high as a musician that he simply has nothing to prove.This is evident here,with a beautiful melange of jazz,blues,country swagger and 'traditional'Dire Straits overtones,all complementing Knopfler's aural guitar sound,while the famous guest singers lift this album to an even higher level.A classic!"
5,AWESOME!,"If you like JT, you will like him even more combined with Knopfler. The better the bang! Very soothing and mellow."
3,versions versions versions,"of the four 'additional' tracks mentioned in a previous review, one is from the uk only release of the disc, the other three from a 'continental' single. for anyone interested in the numerous release versions of sailing to philly see [mark knopfler's web site]."
5,Magical,"The long wait was worth it. This album shows Knopfler at the peak of his songwriting skills. Every single track on this CD is beautiful. The songs are cinematic, very atmospheric and ofcourse masterfully played. Mark Knofpler sings better than ever before, and his guitar work is just perfect - melodic and extremely moving. This is a mature piece of work that shows Knopfler's love and dedication for music time and time again. Buy this CD. It won't come out of your player for quite a while..."
3,Average score for an average CD,"Yes it's ok. Yes its music that doesn't grate. But if you're expecting any kind of inspiration or radical creativity then sorry, but you'll be as disappointed as I was. There's nothing here of the Dire Straits that put it's head above the parapet of mediocrity. I suppose if you like a gravelly voice over a few bluesy tracks then its right up your street. If you want a bit more then look elsewhere."
4,A SCOTTISH PIPER STANDS ALONE,"listen to this, I got a great album. This goes great with Sultansof Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits. What it is is one of mark's best songs to Coyote. Sailing to Philadelphia goes to beA great album."
2,"Well-meaning, great guitar, sometimes silly lyrics",Too much of a good thing. The splendid guitar playing can't distract from painfully un-poetic lyrics. Perhaps an instrumental cd would have fared better.
2,Uninspired,"Although Mark still strums his distinctive style throughout the disc the songwriting would be better termed ghostwriting. The wit, emotion and just plain fun that I have come to expect from Mr. Knopfler are missing this go-around. The album seems forced and unprepared as if filling in the blanks was the only concern, giving you listener just that, filler. Hopefully this is just a vacation for Mark and he will give us another true work of art such as Golden Heart with his next effort."
2,Snoozefest ... <yawn>,"Really disappointing - boring, unmemorable, unimaginative. ""Do America"" is colossally silly. I like the sound he creates, but he just doesn't do anything with it. Van Morrison's contribution is a welcome interruption to MK's trudgingly soporific singing."
2,Mark Knopfler's now is a Counry singer,"If you are buing this CD expecting Mark Knopfler's performance based on his Dire Straits background - DON'T make a mistake. This is not a rock music anymore - what he is trying to do - I think to get into the American Country top charts. Dire Straits is one of my favorite rock groups and Mark Knopfler's ""the real one"" is great - but I cannot listen to his Country ballads anymore.Hope it helps some of you..."
1,BORING,"If you have come looking for some cool guitar sounds, go elsewhere. There is absolutely NO resemblance or hint of Dire Straits - like sounds here. Very disappointed, and feel the album is heavily over-rated."
3,Mediocre,"Lyrics? About nothing. Music? Mediocre. Sound? Uninspiring. If you want to preserve a good opinion about Mark Knopfler (he certainly deserves it), don't buy."
