5,"I loved Trading Up, it is a great ride!","Candace Bushnell is an excellent novelist with a brilliant and biting comic voice. I just read Trading Up, and as I flip through the pages I see that I have underlined many pages. Her writing is so sharp and funny, and the story kidnapped me for three days. My husband is reading it now and he can't put it down either.I highly reccomend this book, it is the best book I have picked up all year. It would be perfect for summer book clubs.Often, when reading contemporary fiction, I feel like I am mentally chewing gum. Candace Bushnell's voice is so bright and original and refined, it feels like I am reading a classic."
5,Trading Up,I think this is the greatest book I've ever read. Candace Bushnell is a fabulous author and really brings her characters to life. Janey Wilcox has so many things going on in her life and Bushnell manages to describe each detail so well it felt like i was part of the story. I love the way she displays Janey as a ditzy blonde who will do anything to get to the top. I strongly recommend you to read this novel because it is a fun read which will make you think about all the self centred people in the world but at the same time it shows you that its not all fun and games being a celebrity in New York because you never know when your past will just lurk up behind you!
1,An absolute waste of paper...,"This is the first book that I have read by Candace Bushnell and I was very disappointed. Instead of wasting the paper it was printed on, the story should have instead been made into a cheesy Lifetime movie starring Tori Spelling. The plot was slow, boring and predictable while the main characters were detestable. Don't waste your time reading this book!"
2,"Not the worst book I've read, but I still wouldn't bother","This is a pretty mediocre book. Its worst flaw is that every one of the characters is so downright despicable that you end up not caring a jot what happens to any of them. You find yourself hoping that Janey will get her come-uppance, but unfortunately when she does, it's short-lived. The writing is barely okay, certainly nothing outstanding, and the plot development is sluggish.On the positive side, Candace Bushnell obviously knows the Manhattan social scene well and at times you feel that the descriptions are depressingly accurate. I say depressing because it comes across as being such a shallow and superficial world that I am happy to be well removed from it. It's kind of fun to guess at the inspiration behind some of the characters - Gwyneth Paltrow, Rupert Everett, Anna Wintour, Aerin Lauder...I continued with this book hoping it would get better. It didn't. It's not the worst book that I've read, but I still wouldn't recommend it."
1,Pure theft,"I threw this book out once I realized it was a rehashing of ""House of Mirth"" by the classic authoress Edith Wharton. Right down to some of the names. Does the name Selden ring a bell to you? Ok, Ok, it's the guy's Last name in Wharton's book. Skip this book and read the original!http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451527569/qid=1118684771"
1,"Janey Is Shallow, Conceited, and Annoying!","The main character in Ms. Bushnell's story ""Trading Up"" is one of the most annoying character's that I've read in a long time. I liked her somewhat in the story ""4 Blondes"" but she is shallow, and very selfish. I found this a difficult book to enjoy since the main character was such a snot and the nasty way she used people and treated people that were close to her, never mind how she treated and used people that were simply in her way also became rather tedious.I found that although the overall story about improving ones life through social connections could have been fun this one just really fell short of the mark. IF on the other hand you like shallow, self involved characters then this is the book for you."
2,leaves you feeling empty,"Yes I had a hard time putting this book down, but only because I wanted it to be over! If I weren't the type of person who has to finish what they started I would have stopped reading it. The ""protagonist"" is completely unlikable. As a matter of fact there are few truly likeable characters in the book, Janey's sister Patty and her husband Digger being the only two I can think of. It's about a bunch of narcissistic freaks. I like a summer trash novel where you want the protagonist to succeed or find happiness or love or something. In this book, and maybe this is the point after all, Janey is written to be the protagonist, but is also the primary antagonist as well. The end was also a little quick and neat and clean, leaving itself open to...yikes...a sequel...which I will definitely not read. A great disappointment after Four Blondes, which I enjoyed."
1,Disappointed,"I just finished reading Trading Up and was disappointed. I expected something similiar to the Sex in the City. (characters you could relate too and laugh with). I felt that Janey, the main character was cold and unlikable. Someone in the book called her a Black Widow Spider - and she was. I can't believe that I invested 500 plus pages on such an unlikable character who never changed.I kept expecting it to turn around....it didn't... Very disappointing."
2,Boring!,"This book was boring. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. The main character, Janey, is very unlikable. It was hard to get to the end of the book because I really didn't care by that point."
1,Is there a plot to this book?????,I was VERY disapointed by this book. I could not even finish it. I didn't care about the character or her sad stupid story.Shame on me for reading as much as I did.
4,Yummy Summer Fun,"Inarguably no ""Custom of the Country"", Candace Bushnell's latest book is about as tasty as a Krispy-Creme doughnut. While low on nutrients, it's a high-caloric read, and a perfect beach accessory. Ultimately, the heroine's immorality fails to produce an overwhelming amount of sympathy, but you want Janey Wilcox to win out anyways, if only because she's desperate, pretty, and ambitious. Besides, it's always fun, if only for a few hours, to believe that women like this exist."
1,Empty Book,"Petty and downright boring. Name dropping, sideways glances, lies, snooty women, disgusting men... I made it through the first three chapters and decided my self-worth was much to great than to waste my time on reading even one more page of this book. Unless you like reading about the empty lives of shallow, insecure, unhappy upperclass, purge this book from your reading list!"
2,Don't expect a fun page-turner,"I am a huge Sex and the City fan and was hoping for a fun, interesting summer read. However, I found myself struggling a bit to finish this book (I actually stopped about halfway through and then finished it later). For the hundreds of pages, there's surprisingly no real plot. It's more of an often-boring look at the characters' lives, not to mention, I really didn't even grow to like any of the characters. I'd agree with others that Janey in particular is shallow, self-absorbed and really somewhat annoying.If you want to read a Candace Bushnell book, I would HIGHLY recommend reading Lipstick Jungle. I've been disappointed with a few of her books but Lipstick Jungle was actually a great one that I couldn't put down. Definitely don't waste your time on Trading Up."
1,Complete and total letdown,"This novel fell short of what I expected. The plot was slow and by the time I had read a majority of the book, I convinced myself to finish, thinking maybe it would be better, but no such luck... Do not buy. Do not read............"
3,"Stylish, but not as Sexy as other Bushnell Books","As a fan of Sex and the City and anything penned by Candace Bushnell, her latest novel, isn't a good follow-up to 4 Blondes. The main character, Janey Wilcox is a beautiful model, climbing the social ladder but faulters a few times on the way up. I personally like Janey, but found it difficult to fully understand her. I guess that was Bushnell's intent, to show that Janey was all mixed up inside, however she needed to make it clear to the audience exactly why Janey was mixed up.Nevertheless, if you're looking for a stylish book about NY socialites and their dirty secrets, Trading Up, is a must-read."
1,Shallow book about shallow characters.,"SLOW, uninteresting writing about people that are impossible to care about. If this is really NYC Wanna Be High Society...they can have it, just don't make us read it. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
2,Mean spirited and no fun at all,"I bought Trading Up hoping for an intelligent beach read, having preceded it with the amusing but ultimately middling The Devil Wears Prada. Instead, I was disappointed in both the quality of the writing and the tone of the book. I found her characters to be incredibly mean-spirited, and the whole story distasteful. I did not read Four Blondes, but I did read Sex and the City, and found her observations of life in New York to be well-drawn, if slightly depressing. I think this book had the potential to be much, much better. Usually authors improve with each succeeding book. In this case, I just sense that Candace Bushnell was really ticked off about something and took it out on her characters, none of whom I had any sympathy for whatsoever."
1,Bushnell Bombs,"The back cover describes this book as ""hilarious"". Did whoever wrote that review actually read this book? I think not.The Publishers Weekly review on this site says - ""There is a black hole in the center of the book in the form of Janey Wilcox, a character so dull and humorless that she makes this whole elaborate enterprise one long, boring slog.""This review describes this book perfectly. I usually read books quickly, but this one was like digging my way out of quicksand. I wanted to give up, but I just knew I had to keep going. I think a few brain cells died during this ordeal.Bottom line: pass on this one, unless you like putting yourself through pure reading torture."
3,Good isn't good enough.,"When I first started reading, I thought maybe this book would be an easy read that I can enjoy for a week or two over the summer. I soon found out that the antics thought up by Bushnell for her main character made it difficult to keep reading. I have a strict policy about not finishing a book, if I start it, I finish it. But this book was the same old story over and over again. Someone should tell the main character, Janey Wilcox, that yes, it's true, the grass is always greener on the other side. I would recommend this book only if you have nothing better to do, it was fun at times, and there are a few surprises, but Janey is the typical gold digger who finds that nothing and no one will ever be good enough for her."
2,Don't waste your money.,The characters and writing were equally horrid. I'm not exactly sure which is worse. The main character in this book is as deep as a puddle. She is so unenjoyable and poorly written that you feel nothing for her. You can't like or loathe her.
2,Not worth your time or money,"I just finished this book, and needless to say, I was EXTREMLY dissapointed. The story just dragged at some points. The ending was terrible. Lots of loose ends weren't tied up, it as if the author just got tired of writing. After all the hours I spent on this book I was left feeling ripped off. Don't waste your time!"
1,AWFUL,"Haven't ever read anything by Candance Bushnell so I have nothing of hers to compare this to, but I found this book to be AWFUL. The main character made me sick to my stomach by her shallowness and how FAKE she was. I find books enjoyable when I can relate to the characters in it, even if somewhat remotely. Everyone in this book was so DISGUSTINGLY shallow, I could not relate to it at all.The only reason I kept on reading was because I hoped Janey Wilcox would somehow redeem herself, but it didn't happen. Waste of time!"
5,Trading Up,Candace Bushnell is an amazing author! I read this book in one weekend - I couldn't put it down for long!
4,"Great ""Beach Reading""","Fantastic, quick read. Lots of fun and interesting characters. If you liked ""Sex and the City"" and ""Four Blondes"" you are sure to love this one as well!"
3,Okay read,Honestly I read this book because I wanted to buy a book that would last me a while. I wanted a thick book with a low cost. This fit the bill. I didn't watch Sex in the City so I didn't know how this book would be. It was okay. I usually don't read these types of books and probably wouldn't read it again but it was nice to read something out of my norm. The writing wasn't bad in my opinion but it just isn't the type of book I would normally read. I would probably recommend this book to people who enjoyed Sex in the City.
1,Save your money...,I am not going to my waste my time or yours by writing a long review here. I will simply sum up this horrible piece of trash literature by saying this ---- I feel so incredibly sorry for the poor tree that was chopped down and milled for this utterly annoying hunk of garbage. What a waste. Candace Bushnell should be ashamed of this wreck.
1,A long hard slog,"I really like Sex and the City, but Trading Up is just stupid. The characters aren't insightful and it's full of cliche, even the ending where everything comes together magically in 8 pages. Barf."
1,"Not plot or character driven, a book that goes nowhere","I read Trading Up with few expectations but I was still disappointed. If you're looking for a quick, light read, look elsewhere; this is probably the most taxing book I have ever picked up. Janey, the main character, may be unlikable, but she is also maddeningly boring. I found that I didn't care about the minutiae of her life, or the lives of her friends and acquaintances, all of whom seemed to be almost identical to Janey both in personality and lifestyle.Bushnell references brand names and New York landmarks frequently and with such insistence that you are reminded of the type of people who, like her prose, feel the need to compensate for their lack of personality."
1,Appallingly written,"La Bushnell should be embarassed by this one. The worst thing is not the go-nowhere plot or the vapid characterisation - it's the writing. The book has the affected, overdone feeling of a high-school pupil throwing in every adjective she can think of to boost her word count and impress teacher. I found myself mentally editing this book while reading it. Not worth the effort."
1,UUuggghhh,"Wow, I am not impressed. Though I had never read one of her books, it sounded like a great 'light' read. First of all, one of my pet-peeves is ridiculous character names, and this story is chock full of them. Secondly, the characters are such a bore. And last but not least by far - I really couldn't care less what happens to any of them. This book has been a waste of my time, and I don't think there is any way I will finish it. There's always something better to do - ie: wash dishes, clean the litter box, scrub the toilet......"
2,Parts are Interesting but lacking in plot,"This too long novel tells the tale of a model who dreams of the celebrity type fame that big screen actresses or pop stars endure. The model, Janey Wilcox, is not short of doing anything to get there including lying to best friends and sleeping with men for money. The novel really does not have much of a plot or twists. The only redeeming feature is to experience life from a socialite, celebrity, or extremely well-off persons point of view. I am sure the author has knowledge in this area being she wrote this after she was very famous herself."
2,Boring!,"I was very disappointed in this book. There was little to no plot. The main character, Janey, was unlikeable. I just wanted her to shut up and go away. A waste of time!"
1,Perfect gift for insomniacs,Why anyone would be interested in reading about people like these is beyond my comprehension. They are completely pathetic.I didn't find anything amusing or charming about the story or the characters.A big B-O-R-E
2,Lifestyles of the Rich and Wannabes,"Very light fluff. A primer for the aspiring Paris, Linday, Anna Nicole, Tara and wannabes-in-the-making."
3,Still waiting for the book to get better,"I have read Candace Bushnell's previous books and enjoyed them and found them funny, unfortunately Trading Up did not live up to my expectations. I did not like the main character, or really anyone in the book, and felt no connection to the characters. The plot was dull and boring with no humor. The ending was seemed to have no climax, and instead just fizzled out leaving me feeling like this is how it ends? I would not recommend this book to any of my friends and caution anyone else who buys it even for ""beach reading."""
3,Shame on you Ms Bushnell!,"From the terrific Sex & The City, to the satisfactory 4 Blondes, Candace Bushnell has hit a iceberg with Trading Up. Janey Wilcox is the main character in this book (first introduced in 4 Blondes) and she is possible the most unlikeable character ever! I found I couldn't sympathise with her in this novel. Perhaps that was the idea Bushnell had - to create a female protagonist whom the reader dislikes. This book is sllllooooow moving, though towards the latter stages of the novel it got slightly more interesting (barely). I was disappointed with this one - if you're really stuck for something to read then this is the book for you! I think Sex & The City (on which the show is based, in case you've been living under a rock!) was heaps better!"
4,Love of designers,I love sex and the city and thought 4 blondes was okay I was glad that my favorite character from 4 blondes was the focus of this book. If you love the fashion of sex and the city and the designer band names you will love this book. It is sad to see the fall and raise of the main character. This story gives you hope to overcome a lot of difficult things. I thought this was a good read and I was sad to see it end. I can't wait for the next book by Candace Bushnell.
2,A disappointing read,I really thought that this would be a great book... but the book dragged and it was really hard to get to the end. As I was reading i kept hoping it would get better and that Janey would have some revelation and her life would change...but in the end she's still the same and we don't really know if she's going to become a good person or not. The ending was not conclusive or exciting. I wouldn't suggest reading it.
1,Can't get through it!,I have read Miss Bushnell's other books and bought this one for a trip I went on. While starting out ok it just kept getting worse and I finally put it down without finishing it. Books should not be this painful to get through. The characters have no redeeming qualities and there are parts that drag on forever. Skip this book and read Sex in the City a second time.
1,Don't even bother with the paperback,"There exists a very fine line between the quick witted tongue in cheek insider humor and the sappy smaltz of Jackie Suzanne and unfortunately Ms Bushnell has descended into the Valley of the Dolls. Who knows, maybe it has something to do with all of the hairspray fumes,or maybe she has simply become one of the reviled 40 somethings, but she has clearly lost her edge. The novel starts well, with her characteristic ascerbic wit, but as she grows her charactersshe seems to take everything far too seriously. After the first 4 chapters, the quirky satire that has been the hallmark of Ms Bushnells work, tries to get deep, and spirals into a very badly concieved soap opera. Barbara Cartland watch out. Janey Wilcox will take you down!"
3,Not brilliant but an easy holiday read,"Okay, so it's not Austen, (which to me is a good thing!). It's not the worst book i've ever read, in fact i didn't think it was all that bad. It's a very easy read and i have to say it's a lot better than her sex & the city novel, to me that was a real waste of time(and i didn't even finish it...that's 2&1/2 hrs of my life i am never getting back...alas!)But you know what, it flows, the main character does become quite likeable and i coudln't help but laugh at the manhattanites she portrays. I'd give it a thumbs up, not a big one, but still i'd give it one"
1,How else can you say Pure Trash.,"This book is trash. Simply trash. The author is trash, the book is trash, and frankly, anyone reading this junk has got problems. This is the type of junk people read when they have nothing redeaming in their lives - there's nothing interesting, the characters aren't the least real, likable, or interesting. This is the type of book a fat girl will read at the gym, wishing her life were different. If your IQ is over 45, skip this and read a gum wrapper instead. It has more intellectual content"
2,Disappointing,"I just finished Trading Up the other night...I was not impressed. The book begins fairly well, mainly character introductions and so forth, about midway through the book your interest peaks and then FLOP! Bushnell rambles about J. Wilcox's past for far too long,you loose interest and the book fizzles at the end. The main character is one you can't relate to nor like. I would have stopped reading it when my interest was lost but had invested so much time into reading it I just want to finish this 504 page book. My first comment after was very disappointing. After having read 4 Blondes(which I likes a bit better)This book was a let down. I am not an avid reader of ficton, I prefer non-fiction, so I thought I may have been too critical in my review,however after reading a few of the other readers comments I see I am not. My advice choose wisely it is a long book."
4,Highly Entertaining,"As a fan of Sex and the City (the show, haven't read the book yet), I was pretty excited to read this book. A customer left it at my work one night and I started reading it. By the end of my shift I was so engrossed in this book that I took it home. That was 3 days ago and I only have a few chapters left to read. I'm hoping the owner doesn't come back to pick it up so I can lend it to my girlfriends. It's a really easy read, but incredibly entertaining. I loved how Candace worked in real life Hamptons drama into this fictional novel. I highly recommend this book for a nice simple summer read."
1,Loathsome heroine,"While I enjoyed SEX AND THE CITY and FOUR BLONDES well enough, this book repulsed me because of its vile leading character. If this book was meant to be satirical, it does not succeed. Its heroine is self-absorbed and unlikable. We're told she's gorgeous, but nothing about her personality or her behavior is attractive, so we never root for her. The only characters I liked in the entire book were her sister, husband and best friend."
1,Don't buy this book,"I disliked this book enough to get out of bed to come write this review to prevent others the agony of the knowledge that they paid good money to own this P.O.S. Horrible writing, no character development, virtually no plot. I have always hated Sex & the City so I don't know why I expected more for my $9 and change from Target. Candace Bushnell and the women characters she creates are self-loathing, neurotic witches. I hope she dies drunk and alone in a flophouse."
2,It was OK ...,"good enough to finish (on StairMaster, where there was nothing else to do), but if I had never read it, I wouldn't have missed anything."
2,"Long drawn out, but a steamy ending","I absolutely loved 4 blondes, so I was looking forward to reading Bushnell's next book about the man prowling Janey. However I was disappointed because there was no steamy sex scenes or hardly any excitement to keep me reading unlike her previous book. Janey gets married which that was a big mistake and most of the book include the borning details of married life like her hating her husband's socks and whatnot.But there was a sudden change when she had a flashback in the beginning days of modeling. Which I think that the whole book should have been based on that, it would have made it much more interesting and more exciting to read.Judging by the ending there should be a sequal and I hope that this next one is much better."
3,Bored?,"If you're looking for a Cinderella story where the beatiful golden-hearted princess conquers all--look further. Janey Wilcox, Bushnell's main character, is anything but a princess, in fact I grew to despise her by the end of the novel. So is this a good or a bad thing? Actually, I think that one should applaud Bushnell for making her lead not so darn lovable. I think she depicts personal motivations fairly accurately--in the sense, of course, that Janey is a power hungry, social climbing super-model.Trading Up is a worthwhile read if you are willing to accept the fact that some parts tend to drag on or could be omitted. As another reviewer mentioned ""It Would Be Better on the Beach""...I couldn't agree more."
2,Save Your Money,"I had a hard time getting through the 500+ pages and kept thinking it would get better and it never did. there really was no plot, the writing was flat, and the characters unlikeable. it painted a very shallow and depressing picture of dating in the city. Don't bother spending a cent on this book."
1,incredibly disappointing,"Just couldn't find anything here to like. I kept waiting for Janey to get what was coming to her -- what a lame excuse for a human being -- but, in the end, she was unscathed. Unfortunately, this is probably the way it works for people like Janey in the ""real world,"" but that doesn't mean that I want a story that I read for entertainment to come out this way! The characters I was actually somewhat interested in (Patty, for example) were such an afterthought. They would pop in an out of the story so randomly that it almost gave me whiplash.I loved ""Sex and the City"" by Bushnell but this was just disappointing."
1,Trading DOWN Big Time!,"Unfortunately, I do not have anything good to say about this book. The plot does not make sense but is predictable at the same time. The characters are 1-dimensional and irritating to boot. Even the mention of supposed high fashion and luxury here and there could not make me enjoy this book. I really like what Candace Bushnell represents but I am afraid she did not quite make the cut this time around."
2,Does it ever end?,I'm wondering if Bushnell gets paid for each word. I'm hardly halfway through and I actually have to FORCE myself to keep going and only because I paid for the book. This is the literary equivalent to Gigli: a disaster.
1,So boring,"I've made it more than halfway through, I'm bored stiff and I refuse to give this book any more of my time. The silly character names were a turn-off from the beginning, ""Comstock Dibble""? ""Mauve""? ""Digger"" the rock star? Spare me."
1,I tried but can't even get to chapter five,"I am an avid reader and enjoy any genre as long as the characters are engaging and the storyline in captivating. Unfortunately, this book has neither. I found myself glazing over text and just turning pages in an effort to hurry to something happening. Didn't find anything. Gave up. Will return the book.(this is really hard for me to write as I ONLY have HBO to watch Sex and the City On Demand...)"
2,slow,"The last 100 pages of this book were great. Unfortunately, it's a 400 page book. Good overall story and plot, but it weaves more than the Mississippi River."
4,Works good!,I ordered this as I didn't have lots of space for my dishes.This worked out great and would recommend it.Just make sure you measure before you order.
5,"Great IMAX movie, a must-see for any big *NSYNC fan!","I went to see this movie with my BF and I absoloutly love it! It was so cool, even though it was only a concert, not an actual movie. If you went to see it in an IMAX theatre, it was like having the best seat in the house! (aka: front row middle!) I really enjoyed it, and it is a must-see for any *NSYNC fan!"
1,Outdated because of new investigation,"Heresay writing and knee jerk opinion. Too many people were anxious to pen their ""expertise"" on the matter even though these publications proved to be premature and obsolete as additional discovery played in. The author's account is no longer relevant."
3,Maybe,I am happy with the seller's service. The product supposed to provide many benefits that I have not noticed (time will tell). No futher comments at this time.
1,Junk,The grill is great but the grill cover didn't last a month. The stitching came apart and it's worthless.
3,Rayovac Hearing Aid Batteries,I was hoping they lasted longer than a week but they don't. With so many at least I do not have to go to the store and buy then all the time
2,Not my thing,"Watched w/ladyfriend, both of us are foreign flick fans. Alas, we got lost along the way due to the boredom. Has some moments but I would avoid."
4,Easy....,"We recieved this crib as a gift for my son three years ago...we have only had two complaints. When he was very young the mattress did not come up far enough so we would have to reach way down to get to him. He was in this crib until he was two and a half, we moved him when we found that he could get in and out with very little difficulty. And when he was ready for a toddler bed this one was useless...you cannot safely use any sort of rail on the side so he would fall out very easily. Now that it is storage awaiting it's next use we know that it takes up very little space to store, it takes up about six inches against the wall of the closet. I would buy it again for the reasonable price, it is worth it and looks more expensive."
5,Great crib for the price!,"A coworker of my husband's ordered this crib via internet four years ago for their expected child and they received two, the company told them just to keep the extra...I thought that was a little strange but I won't complain since they GAVE us the extra. So we got this crib for FREE and I haven't had any complaints about it yet. Our son didn't use it regularly until he was around 4 months old so the height adjustments weren't an issue at all for us. All our bedding and everything fit great with this crib and it seems that nothing clashes! It is now in storage (again very little storage space taken up in our smaller house!) awaiting the next baby coming in late summer. Since it is such a neutral color it will work with all my son's ""big boy"" furniture since the kids will be sharing a room for now."
2,Not bad at all for this price.,"This crib is not bad at all for this price, actually a lot better than I would have expected it to be."
4,David's best book before he went insane,"It's been a long time since I read this book, but I remember finding it an impressive, lucid piece of leftist writing. It's a shame that David has turned into such a right-wing ideologue in recent years, because there was a time when he had some good things to say."
3,It Would Be Better With A Manual,Mine came quickly but when I opened the package there was no manual even though the package indicated there should be one. I e-mailed E-Link giving them the details and the serial number of my unit. Their initial response was that the whole package would have to be returned because they do not have any drivers or manuals available online or to mail.I fired off a strong protest and they e-mailed the missing manual the next day in PDF format (which was fine with me). Interesting approach to say the least! Not that there was that much in the manual but I couldn't tell that without seeing it.I've installed the USB hub portion and it works just fine. It will be a while before I can try out the ethernet portion.
2,Victorian Undertaker,"It's too much money to pay for a book that is only 32 pages.It was too short for such a ""deep"" subject. Most illustrations were taken from newspapers. It's not a bad book, it's just cost too much for what little it provides. In short, you can get a much better book at the price."
3,wtf,I guess i should've look for detail of the content of this dvd. but it only covered 3 locations of the wrc. If i had known it only covered 3 locations i woulda picked the one with norway and japan.
5,Four Sets of Friends,This book was wonderful. Four doctors and their wives were friends with each other. I liked the beginning of the book where the 4 wives were peeling apples together.
5,A WARM FEELING OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN FOUR DOCTORS AND WIVES,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was focused on the friendship of four doctors and their wives. This friendship gave a warm feeling. Though some doctor-related stress and problems were mentioned, the main focus of the book was on the happy friendship of the four families. I appreciated this friendship and loyalty. I also enjoyed the sequel, 'The Doctor's Desperate Hour'. In this book the families decided their friendships were too close and dedicated, so they tried to give it a shot of not seeing each other (even though they couldn't do it, and snuck to see each other). But in the happy end, they realized they needed each other and should not be apart."
4,Worth reading!,"This book provides a detailed study of one of the greatest crime films ever made. Heat is Director Michael Mann's greatest masterpiece and this book gives a detailed explanation of the meanings of each scene from the film.This book won't interest everybody, but Heat is my favourite movie of all time and this book is well worth reading for anybody who has an obsession for the film."
4,cosmic american music?,"I bought the Wrenfields after coming across them almost by accident while looking for similar artists to perennial fave's the Jayhawks. On the strength of the Jayhawks recommendation ""one of Louris' favourite bands"" I purchased and am surprised and delighted at the quality herein. There is a whole raft of styles from Country Rock, Bluesy type guitar, Rock, Alternate Country and even touches of bluegrass. Song writing credits are shared as are the vocals. 1st song sets the tone with its immediate familiarity and warmth and while there are a couple of overly Christian moments and some indecipherable lyrics in place, most of it is in the same vein. To be honest I would probably look at Blue Mountain prior to getting the Wrenfields but once you've exhausted all other Alt Country avenues its nice to know that there is unpretentious, feel good stuff like this here too."
5,"Silly, Fun, and Educational Too","This book is an absolute scream!Believe it or not, my college bookstore actually carried this item. As a pre-exam stress break, I picked it up and started thumbing through it. I laughed so hard that I had to buy it._Bunches...of Bunnies_ is a book written to teach children the wonders of multiplication in a fun, silly way. Low on text, and high on pictures, this is meant for the just-learning-to-read set.I just think the pictures are so adorable. Unlike a typical children's book, in _Bunches...of Bunnies_, the expressive and sometimes mischevious bunnies are featured doing everything from going to school to playing pool.I can't wait until I become an aunt, as I plan to buy this for all my nieces and nephews."
3,there is no cause worth this indecency and inhuman behaviour,"Considering where Mr Hatem come from and what he beleives in, it will be very hard beleiving all his accounts and all his stories. On the other hand knowing Mr Hobieka and his true nature, gives Mr Hatem's acusations some credibility .It is shame and what a trajedy to have some one holds this kind of criminal record climb the political ladder to be a minister, and claim to be the protector of the christian cause. WHAT CAUSE?????I say to all the followers of H.K Samir G.Bashir J. you got what you wished FOR."
1,A disappointing book,"This book is banned in Lebanon. However, I took the risk and paid seven times the price to get a photocopied version. Apart from the terrible grammar and syntax, the book is full of contradicting dates and alleged facts. Many of the tales can never be verified, and the author's credibility does not exist in the first place. For someone looking for evidence and real confessions, I think this book will only be a source of confusion and disappointment. But for someone who is looking for sexual adventures of society figures, things will be different. The only thing that troubled me was that I paid a lot of money on a book that did not deserve all the trouble, risk and excitement."
1,La cause chrétienne,"Après t'avoir vu sur Al Jazira hier...On se moquait de toi en contrepartie de quelques Dollars. Après avoir lu tes btises dans ce chef d'oeuvre qu'est ""From Israel to Damascus""....J'ai su pourquoi la cause chrétienne est par terre...Cobra, je te rappelle que mieux vaut une bouche cousue qu'un cul ouvert....Bavard comme une pie tais toi....Les gens se moquent de nous, qui avons cru en une cause pure et juste...Pas de toi ni de ton maitre qui avez toujours su ce que vous faites...Réveilles toi, mieux vaut tard que jamais"
3,Great Intelligence Work,"At a time where the current Lebanese government is busy prosecuting nothing but the past government, the Cobra book is surprisingly released to ""overkill"" a minister who was one of the key people in that past government. I will remind you that Elie Hobeika was massively invloved in the so called ""Sabra & Chatila massacres"". The same people who are condemning this guy now where applauding then. What has changed except his loyalties from pro-Israeli to pro-Syrian to pro-Hariri. All this sounds too perfect to be just a naive act of a person who wanted to get all the load off his chest... why now ? It is so easy to adapt Cobra's book to any Lebanese polititian. Finally, let us by this book condemn not only HK but the entire Lebanese politicians."
4,Good contents but very bad translation,"The book is full with very critical information, however the grammar and translation are so bad to a point you loose track of the subject. I wish I can get a copy written in Arabic."
4,"Great read, even though the English is terrible","This is an important book, the first of its kind to be written by such an insider. It should be required reading for ultra-nationalists and other would-be thugs! But where was the editor while it was being written? The English is truly horrible, embarrassingly so at times. The poor grammar and word choice unfortunately diminish the strength of the prose, but not the power of the narrative."
2,Lacks the graphic and visual effect.,"The cover of this book is beautiful, but like the old saying: ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" I was disappointed that the book told of tales of ""sea"" related entities not just ""mermaids"". This book lacked the visual effect that I was hoping to obtain from a ""fantasy"" book. Unlike the exhilarating book, ""Mermaids: Nymph of the Sea"", A Treasury of Mermaid was lacking in graphics and story."
2,The title is somehow confusing and deceptive.,"I am definitely not a scholar or for that matter an expert in literature. But as a simple reader and someone who is looking for certain subject titles to purchase through the web, reading this one, Prophets: The Assyrian Period, gave me the impression that the book was somehow relating to Assyrian history as a core matter of the book. It turned out to be all about the Israelites prophets in the period when the Assyrian Empire of antiquity was in power. The author could have had his title as such Prophets: from X to Y (indicating years as desired)."
1,Not what it seems,"Although it is difficult to get a good picture of how this ring looks given that you can only see it from one angle, the blue color of the stone is much darker in real life, and it doesn't resemble any tanzanite stones I have seen. Plus it is an emerald cut not a princess cut, if that matters to you. I wouldn't buy this ring, unless you are sure you want it because no shipping costs are refunded."
3,Return of Optimus John Prime,Be Very Careful with the year on the video if you get the wrong video with 1986 with Peter Collen as Optimus Prime 2 your dust. My best bet is to get the videos with 1985 and 1984 with Jack Angel as Optimus Prime the real one and he is better than Peter Collen! Well this video is good. Optimus Prime has a Deep Voice i know that i've seen Transformers Generation 2 with Jack Angel in every ep as Optimus Prime! These ep's wont be shown in the play back this year sorry transformers fans. But I got this video today i'm getting vol 4 after my myrtle beach stay with Optimus Prime my Finacee. Truckin Along With Optimus Prime! Driver Amy
2,Not Good Enough,"I admit I am not an actor or an Olympia Dukakis fan but I was curious about this book. She drew me in by going for what most of us know her by--her Oscar for Moonstruck. But the book was too vague in so many places she brushed over her family life with generalities like I was so busy. She just says I got a role in this play but didn't say how she went about it, who she called, who she knew or who helped her. I was disappointed in the ending and her experiences with the ashrams. Those experiences were the ones she really wanted to share to attempt to inspire other women. I enjoyed reading about her Greek heritage in the beginning of the book, much much more."
5,Includes Cole Porter,"A good selection of the great Cole Porter songs, some sung and played by Cole Porter himself. Includes a variety of artists."
2,"Good, but not complete","This is a very helpful encyclopedia, but I am often surprised by the topics that seem to be missing. Perhaps a better title would be, ""Selected Topics For Early Christianity."" Not a bad resource for the price (paperback version)."
1,disappointed,"I have been waiting a long time to find a copy of this movie.I really enjoyed it when I saw it on tv and fell in love with Lynda Carter's singing voice.I was so excited when I found it here and could hardly wait for it to arrive.Image my dismay when I put it in to play and it keeps popping out after only a few seconds of play.I know it's not the player, as other movies play fine in it.Hopefully I will have better luck with another copy."
2,A copy instead of used video,Poor video quality. It was supposed to be used but I believe that it is a poor copy. SAB
1,WHAT A FAKE!!!,"Advertised, this trio of films sounded great. When in my hands (after purchasing it) the trio turned out to be only the Linda Carter flick. The vendor refunded the money I paid and apologized. Oh well..."
3,The game isn't perfect but then again none of them are,Sims Livin' Large is a great game. True it's not the best. None of the sims are. Example:- Sims 2 isn't perfect because it frezzes takes a long time to load and the toddlers don't have the best hair choices.I think if you buy this game you will be very happy. It's a good game and it's fun. If you have never played sims before this would be a great oppertunity.
4,"In her presence, but not in mine!","I appreciated the author not going into the gory details of the abuse being committed against the characters. She did manage to convey their pain and anguish of the acts that they endured and believe me you feel the same pain and anguish. I met the author and bought the book on a Saturday evening and finished it on Sunday the very next night. I could not put it down. It hurt to see someone reach out to the community for help only to be told to mind her business and then to see one of the abused reach out for help only to learn one of life's most difficult lessons, and that is just because you need and ask for help doesn't mean you will get it. There are some instances where the help you need can only be given by yourself."
5,Nancy Weaver has written a captivating,"Nancy Weaver has written a captivating, yet disturbing tale about the legacy of intergenerational abuse.Maebelle Hawkins is so set on marrying a wealthy husband that she refuses to heed to warning signs that Rufus Poygoode will be more trouble than he's worth. Believing that Maebelle is the daughter of Olga Berry, the aunt who destroyed his childhood and his innocence, Rufus is determined to get his revenge through Maebelle and her four young daughters.In Her Presence is a heartbreaking story of a family too paralyzed to save themselves and a town full of people that sit back and do nothing to help. Although the subject matter is difficult to read, this book is definitely a page turner as readers wait for someone in the four generations of Poygoode children to stand up against their abusive father.Reviewed By:R. ForemanSista Girl Book Club"
3,The Poygoodes may be living right next door to you!,"Maebell Hawkins don't know what she's in for when she says I do to Rufus Poygood, aka Nogood. This man makes Maebell and her kid's life a living hell. This books keeps you on the edge of your seat as you read, hoping and wishing to help save Maebell's life and the life of her kids. This book is a must read! Hurry up and get this. It was so good that I didn't want to finish it."
3,Not made in the USA.,"Nice set, But I feel I was mislead to beleive this was made in the USA. It isn't, it comes from Tiawan"
4,Good,"If you teach Language Arts you need to read this book. At times one sided, but has so many ideas for you to make your own!"
1,Unrealistic garbage,This book has no actual understanding of how children interact or react to situations where they are expected to be able to learn. Does not take into account that children have not acquired the rationalization to behave in such an adult fashion as this teaching style requires. It is also insulting to the reader.
5,Good 'ol Matlock,"I buy this series and several like it because TV is AWFUL nowadays! This is what tv was made for. Shows that you actually have to think about. this reality junk is just the kind of thing I try to escape from by turning on tv. Matlock was one of the last true crime/mystery shows on TV. I have enjoyed strolling down memory lane watching these episodes. In fact, it's hard not to watch all of them at once, when you get started."
5,Matlock: The Sixth Season,"My brother is a huge Matlock fan, as am I. He received this as a gift for Christmas. It came in a timely manner and was just as expected. It made a great gift!"
2,Item pictured not received,"I really was looking forward to replacing my copy which had been damaged by heat years ago. I had tried locally but was able to find only the monaural version which totally eliminates much of the style that Mantovani uses to simulate, for example the sleigh bells ringing as the sleigh travels by the listener. Imagine how excited I was to be able to find the stereo version pictured while on Pandora, only to be equally disappoint4ed, if ot more so, when the mono version arrived. I haven't decided wherether to throw it in the garbage or to give it to an unsupecting flea market dealer as the shipping is not wotrth the reurn credit."
3,Download lacks deep bass and high treble,"This supposedly is a remake of a '50s record I once owned, but it is lacking at the ends of the tone ranges. I don't believe it even activates my subwoofer. I read that a remix in 2009 is great, and I thought the download was that version. I don't believe it is."
5,Foxman,"This is a timeless classic that I never get tired of listening to , great seasonal favorites done in the ""Mantonini"" style that is so distinctful and rich with character . This is a must have!"
5,good job,"thank's for the good job. I enjoy tape. It's great to enjoy good by, so with that , good by . ART"
2,Not quality,This umbrella is all wood except the ribs that fold out to hold up the umbrella fabric. I received the umbrella with a huge crack running down the center and the button to open the umbrella doesn't work. Lame! But it's a cool design anyways.
5,It Works!,"I absolutely love this product and have been using it for over 14 years. I'm now in my late 40's and have no lines or sagging and my skin is as firm as it was when I was in my 20's. Yes, it's due to this product and it's a major ingredient in another line of products that sells for double the price of these vials. This is the concentrated Ethocyn and a little goes a long way. I have yet to find something better for my eye area and it's also great for my sensitive Rosacea and acne prone skin (I'm lucky huh?). I'm grateful it's still being made and I hope never to be without. I keep trying new anti aging products and they're ok. Some are too heavy or harsh and others are just glorified moisturizers but this and any well formulated retinol product (or prescription strength tretinoin) are the only products that truly make a difference to my skin (and I've tried practically everything!) It's worth every penny!"
2,disappointing price,"I like this product and have used it for years, but the price now is more than I can afford. It was at an affordable price until it got attentoin on a national morning show and immediately the price went up...... Hate to do without you ethocyn, but I just can't afford you any longer"
5,Absolutely works - no joke,"I used to work for Chantal Pharmaceuticals when I was 19, and I saw the actual studies, and photos that were taken of actual users - it's the real deal. Make sure that you apply it evenly to the spots you want tightened (IE, I wouldn't recommend only doing under the left eye, etc.) otherwise, you WILL notice that one side is noticeably firmer. Love it, love it, love it. And - I haven't spoken to anyone at the company in years and years, so this is my honest opinion."
5,The best wrinkle reducer ever!,"I have read endless information on anti aging skin products and looked at dozens of studies that essentially say the only real difference between Oil or Olay and La Prairie is the price... moisture is the essential difference. The exception to this is Ethocyn Essence. In comparative studies only Ethocyn actually, physically reduced wrinkles by about 25% and this has been my experience with the product. I have been using it for twenty years and I feel like ""The Picture of Dorian Grey"" as my face has hardly appeared to age over all this time. I have good skin and am in excellent health which has also played a part however I have carefully watched those places where wrinkles try to develop and Ethocyn, with regular use, just smooths them out. I highly recommend this product."
1,"Cute, but probably not worthy your money or time",This is another book in the collection of books that I inherited from my wife's grandmother. It is essentially a very short collection of thoughts on friendship. Of the fifteen to twenty thoughts on friendship (how do you get something like this published?) I would say maybe five were really fine thoughts. I read the entire thing twice in under five minutes. I don't know that it is worth your money to buy it seeing as how you could undoubtedly find most if not all of the quotes online these days. But perhaps it would be a cute gift for a very good friend.
2,Not real shuffle board beads!,"Some things you can skimp on but this just wasn't one of them they are cheap & do not work well, I would not recommend these to anyone"
5,I adore this set,"I adore this salt and pepper shaker. It's modern without being an eye sore and it's convenient on a full table set. It looks great, it's eye catching and works exactly how a salt and pepper shaker should. And for the price, it's unbeatable."
2,"Looks good, but functionality isn't great","It's pretty, but annoying. The salt shaker has one little hole in it. Life is too short to be annoyed by a salt shaker. Buy it for looks, not usefulness."
2,"Bad writing, good story","This book is very frustrating to read. The writing is horrible - the dialog is so unrealistic it's amusing, the descriptions are clinical and full of ""I'll use obscure words to make you think I'm smart"" language, and the characters are flat and annoying. So why read it? It's a really good story, especially if you're interested in the topic of psychotropic medication. Cook's negative opinion of the drugs comes through loud and clear, but it doesn't spoil the premise. The addition of the link to the Salem Witch Trials adds an extra layer of interest. (Although if he referred to it as ""the affair"" or ""the ordeal"" one more time, I was going to send him a thesaurus.) It's worth reading just for the story if you can put up with the bad writing."
3,Sarah's thoughts,"Robin Cook's Acceptable Risk is a good book but has many dull places and has many medical words. The beginning and end of the book were the only parts that was exciting. The middle section drag on. The plot was about a scientist, Edward Armstrong, discovering a new drug. The drug that might have been accountable for the Salem Witch Trials. The drug was susposed to help alter ones own personality. Instead other things happen to people who took it. It was interesting to read in the book how far somebody would go just to change his/her own personality."
1,Blah Witch Project,"RE: AUDIO CASSETTE VERSION. Forget that the characters are unappealing, the action implausible, the plot unconvincing - this novel is simply boring; boring in a way that no self-respecting medical thriller/occult horror story ought to be. Even had audio reader Jill Eikenberry (TV's L.A. Law) demonstrated some storytelling ability (she did not), I doubt that any entertainment value could have been salvaged from this weak effort."
1,Didn't make it out of second gear.,"The most painfully slow book I've read in years. I don't think he made it out of first gear until about 3/4 the way through the book. With difficulty he finally shifted into second gear and by the end of the book was cruising at a not-so-exhilarating 30 miles an hour. The medical and scientific details are accurate and fairly well-written. The major subplots are ""what's for dinner tonight,"" and ""what will the plumber work on next."" The dialogue is artificial and irritating. It reminds me of a dialogue from one of my third-grader's stories. Using words like ""modicum"" and ""greasy spoon"" I wonder if Mr. Cook could possibly have been born in the same century as the rest of us. I want my $7.00 back!"
1,wouldn't let me do 0 stars...,"I only read this book because a ""friend"" recommended it. I'll never speak to him again.Horrible narrative, [horrible] plot, ridiculous characterization. There are way too many books out there to waste your time on this one. Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read.I'm saddened at the state of American readership when I see all the positive responses here..."
1,Unacceptable writing,"Verging on illiterate, this book will be impossible for any discerning reader to get through. When things are this ham and this clunky, it's impossible to believe in or care about anything that happens. Awful."
3,Good and bad,"This book is written in the typical engaging and page-turning Cook medical suspense style. The character of Kim, and her search for self-confidence and family history, is particularly well-developed. Likewise the Salem witch trial history bit is well-done.However, large parts of the book are rather poorly-done and/or over-done. The extensive plot line about the night creatures who, for a start, kill Edward's dog is just incredible. The evidence of these creatures' identity is all around the researchers and they unbelievably ignore it. Cook uses these creatures to turn a workable and enjoyable medical suspense plot into an over-done gothic novel.Cook also incorrectly casts Prozac and other depression-lifting drugs as personality-changing drugs. The end scene of the medical research facility is unbelievable, and the reader is likewise disappointed with Kim at the end -- she's spent the novel finding her own strength and independence, and she winds up happy mainly because she's with a man."
1,wish i could unread it,"I'll be patient with almost anything with a germ of a good idea, and i thought lab analysis of hallucinogenic mold as an explanation for the witch trials was compelling...together with the pharmaceutical industry, new drug development plot deal...but this book is refried reefer madness (remember? smoke pot and you'll murder the neighbors)...utterly ridiculous, offensive, icky..."
3,Worth Reading,"The book is worth reading, but as usual in Robin Cook books, the conclusion to the story tells you almost nothing you want to know. The story has an excellent Salem Witch Trials back story, but at the end, when ""the mystery was solved"", the concept was abandoned. I would recommend reading this, but don't expect anything that will give you a want to read it again"
3,AGood Read,"Acceptable Risk by Robin CookKim and Edward lack self-confidence. That all changes as they discover more about Kim's family history involving witchcraft in the town of Salem three-hundred-years ago...This was my first venture into the world of Robin Cook and I was pleasantly surprised. His research and story planning kept me wondering what way his plot was going to take me. The medical references did get a little laborious mid way into the book but it didn't distract from my enjoyment.Without giving away the eventual outcome I did feel that some parts towards the end were predictable. He refers to certain things that let you know they will be crucial to the story line towards the end.I found that his characters were strong enough for me to identify with and to be interested in them enough to wonder how they would develop as the story progressed. Do not expect an action-packed thriller. This story relies on investigation and suspense, definitely worth reading."
5,"Excellant Book, Excellant Author!!","I, myself am currently reading this book and so far am enjoying it. A lot of people complain about the plot and characters, yet as a TWELVE year old (anyone shocked? the librarian was!!) I dont catch these things. I love the Author and have read the following. Sphinx,Fever,Contagion,Blindsight,Outbreak,Vital Signs,Chromosome 6, and still reading!!. The books are really riviting and I enjoy every page."
1,Cook's worst,"I have read most books that Robin Cook has written, and this is definetely his worst. The characters as well as the events are completely unrealistic."
3,If you can get past the premise you might enjoy it,If you can get past the main premise of the book that a researcher smart enough to crate a perfect xenograft but dumb enough not to know about the chromosome that hes working with then its a half decent read. Cook knows how faulty this is and its pretty much just skipped over in the book where his other books that involve similar discoveries go into great detail. Not Cooks best work but not his worst either.
1,Dissapointing. Don't waste your time.,"This is one of Cook's weakest attempts at novel. ""Acceptable risk"" is actually a short story, that could have been perfectly told in 100 pages, enlarged with no real purpose (except maybe an editorial one) to almost 400. In the boring middle, one can forsee easily the very predictable end, which becomes even worse when the behaviour of the ""evil"" characters turns illogical, unnatural and laughable. Look for another work by Cook. This one is absolutely dissapointing and forgettable."
4,Loved it!,"I thought this book was great, fast reading. I work in research so it held my interest through the whole thing!"
2,Cook does disservice to real-life chemists,"In his novel, Cook does a disservice to real-life chemists by trivializing and misrepresenting the drug discovery process. Drugs take years to be discovered, tested, and marketed, and are under the utmost federal scrutiny. As a doctor, Cook should take some responsibility to educate his readers with reality as well as to entertain."
1,what was he thinking?,"This book is crap. The idea that he was trying to go after is good, but the way that he executed the novel was almost retarded. It is definately unbelievable and should never have been printed. This was the worst book that I have read by him and the only reason that I finished the novel was to see what other ridiculous things Cook concocted. Two words for this book: table leveler."
4,Which witch is which?,"Unfortunately, I had seen the made-for-TV movie loosely based on this novel before reading it (though I did not realize that until I actually got into the book) so I sort of knew how it was going to end, but I was not completely disappointed.While somewhat predictable (what, did you think the bad guys were going to get away with it?), Cook still manages to find a new villain and ties the present with the past in a believable fashion. A doctor, he knows what he's talking about but explains it understandably so those with no medical knowledge can follow along.Realistic but exciting, definitely a good read."
2,Disappointing,"This book was not worth the time. The storyline was great and inventive, yet Cook used too many medical and chemical terminology that only few could understand. The book dragged on at points and the ending seemed rushed, as if he had to meet a deadline of sorts. I wouldn't recommend this book to be bought by anyone unless you get it for free somewhere."
4,organized approach to help in emergency situations,"When my husband died he left me a three-ring notebook which we had labled the emergency book as it contained all the pertinent information about our financial, insurance, tax, etc. situations including the location of necessary documents such as wills to help settle the estate. This book is comparable and would help anyone become better organized to deal with daily and unexpected situations. With the three ring capability pages can be added that would personalize it to your special needs. sms"
1,WAY overpriced,"It is a helpful book in organizing information, but certainly not worth much more than $10. I paid @$20 5 years ago, and that was too much. Over $900 new?? Are you people nuts??? A lawyer can do the things this book does for less than $900!!"
1,A total piece of Jesuit fiction,"A vile, slanderous attack by a Jesuit hit man on a Father of the Church. O'Donnell completely rewrites history with a seemingly drug-induced plethora of fiction as he seeks to deny every historical fact known to man about St. Augustine. Indeed, if he was to write a history of Germany he is the very type of author who would use 400 pages to show why you should believe the Holocaust never happened too.A thinly veiled attempt by an ignorant Georgetown ""academician"" to defame the name of St. Augustine and to defame the hsitory of the Catholic Church. O'Donnell denies all persesecution of Christians, denies the Papacy, denies Augustine' spirituality and suggests that the Catholic Church violently overthrew the only true and legitimate heir to Jesus' teachings.Revistionist hsitory at its worst ... I suggest we turn this heretic O'Donnell over to the Grand Inquisitor for burning at the stake ... may he ever rot in hell for his absurdly stupid and ignorant comments!!!!!!"
2,Not for the general reader,"If you already have a good knowledge of the late era Roman Empire in North Africa and are already familiar with the religious conflicts and various Christian schools of thought going around you might find this rambling biography informative. Just one example, the author mentions religious groups like the Donatists or Donatism numerous places without clearly indicating their beliefs or why exactly Augustine hated Donatus. In my opinion, not nearly enough definition and clarity for the layman to understand what was going on."
2,Poorly organized book,"Unless you completely understand Augustine and his life and actual background, you will get totally lost in trying to comprehend what the author is saying. The author attempt with this biography is to write about his background and his personal characteristics by chapter, but at times he gets too lost on a different subject matter unrelated to the chapter."
4,Signal Booster for Cable TV,Product works great! Low noise and ample gain to show a marked improvment in my picture. Only bad thing was the method the Motorola used to connect the power to the unit.
5,Motorola Signal Booster,Excellent product. Easy to install and improved the quality of picture for all of the channels we receive. This also allowed me to forego renting a digital cable box from my provider which will be a huge savings in the long run.
1,Motorola signal booster fail,This product did not work at all for boosting signal on an HD broadcast antennae and in fact actually made reception worse. I purchased this product based upon the other reader reviews that praised it for working well but in this case it completely failed. It's possible the unit we received was defective but I did not want to bother with trying a replacement unit. It was tried on 2 television sets on 2 different floors of the house with the same results.
2,Signal Booster didn't solve TV problem,"I was having trouble receiving a few digital TV channels from my cable company. The cable company couldn't figure out why my screen would go from OK to black back to OK. They were sure there was something wrong with my coax cable inside my home. I installed the Motorola Signal Booster after my cable had gone through two signal splitters. It didn't help the problem with my picture.Eventually, I solved my problem by bypassing one of the splitters and removing a signal trap that the cable company had placed on my line when my home was built. Maybe the Motorola Signal Booster would have worked had I been able to place it immediately after the signal trap. I couldn't do that easily because there was no electrical service near the spot where the signal trap was as the cable entered my home."
1,Don't Buy For Over the Air HDTV Boost,"I took a flyer on this unit base on some of the positive reviews but it is confirmed by experience and a personal call to Motorola that despite the package description that shows an outdoor antenna as a possible input into this device. this unit does not work for antenna connections, it only works for cable TV inputs."
4,tv aerial booster,"Did what I hoped it would do, made our tv signals morem in number and stronger strenth for the more distant stations."
1,"This product is worthless, deceptive adverising Not for OTA","Connected this Signal Booster to a 72"" radio shack antenna. Without the signal booster, the reception is near perfect for analog, pretty good for digital but sometimes fox's reception will drop out. After installing the Signal Booster, the analog stations all show ""snow"". So then I try the HD, ..... nothing. I am not recieving a strong enough signal for ANY channel to display.I called Motorola tech support and they said that there is a ""misprint"" on the package and it does not actually work with an antenna, only cable. That is my last try with Motorola products. From my experience they are rarely reliable."
1,Did the opposite of what it was supposed to do!,"I bought this item based on the reviews here on Amazon.com from other HDTV users and after trying every possible antenna angle and every possible configuration it WEAKENED my signal strength by half! What a waste of money. I bought the Antenna Direct DB-2 and it works remarkably well especially considering it uses no power but I was hoping that this would boost the signal strength a bit as I consistently get between a 45 and 55 % signal. After hooking up this product, I could never get a reading any higher than 25%. Buyer beware! it may work fine for cable but don't buy this expecting it to increase your over-the-air HDTV signal. Invest in a good antenna instead!"
2,Call your Cable company before you buy,"I was told by the cable company that this device was boosting the signal on the up load too much that it kept making my modem get off line even more. So before you spend the money on this, if you have a problem with your cable modem, make the cable company do their job. What they are pay to do and fix your problem."
2,TV Antenna amplifier,"The delivery and everything were excellent but the product did not amplify the TV signal as I had expected. Talking with motorola, We concluded that product was not going to solve the amplification problem."
3,Works OK,"I bought this to boost my cable siginal which I was splitting between my TV, DVR and Computer. The improvement wasn't as noticible as I had expected. It does provide a boost for my rabbit ears. I had been using an old Radio Shack amplifier that I purchased about 12 years ago. I don't think it was much of an improvement over my old unit."
1,Insignificant signal improvement,"The Motorola Signal Booster was a major disappointment. The main reason I bought this product is because I wanted to have a much better cable signal for our two TV sets. However, as I found out the hard way, this product does not boost the signal at all. I've tried the recommendations/instructions of several reviewers but just the same, it does not work as advertised. The only configuration that showed very little improvement was when I connected the Motorola booster in one of the outputs of my AR 2.5GHz 2-way video splitter. If I connect it before the splitter, it just mess up the signal. This is one product I regret buying. It's a total waste of money."
4,works,works as advertised. i have a few long stretches and a couple of splitters and this thing handles it.
5,Works Great!!!!!!!,"Intermittent HD signals and no modem signal was my problem. Working off a very old cable system within the house that I just purchased. After many useless trips to the local RShack, I found this great item here on Amazon. I connected this to a 42"" Samsung Plasma and Internet cable modem and have not had any problems since. It works just as advertised."
4,Motorola Signal Booster,"I purchased the Motorola Signal Booster for a relative who lives in a rural area and doesn't have cable or a satellite dish. After the digital switch that occurred in July (which was suppose to offer additional channels) they couldn't even get some of the major network channels like ABC, and on some of the other channels the signal was weak and the picture would constantly pixelate, fade in and out, or disappear altogether.After the signal booster was installed they can now get ABC and even more of the channels they were suppose to get with just the digital box. They are quite pleased with the product and in fact I ordered 2 more for the other TV's. The only problem (which probably doesn't have anything to do with the signal booster) is after 12 midnight a lot of the channels go out. I suspect maybe the digital signal strength is reduced in the late night hours.Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 Bi-Directional RF Amplifier"
4,Not the booster's fault,The booster didn't fix my problem but it's not the booster's fault. The Comcast signal is intermittent - not continuously weak. Took the booster to the cabin and it improved the over-the-air signal. The cable that comes with the booster should be used for the power input. Use RG-6 quad shield for the signal.
1,Not recommended,I am a cablevision customer and when I hooked up the cablebooster I was not able to get any picture. I had contacted Motorola and they recommended that I replace it however the new one I received had the same issues.Contact your cable provider before you purchase this item.
5,Great signal booster,"Bought this booster to replace a Cisco unit originally installed by local cable company. This unit was a simple drop-in replacement that actually offered a cleaner signal (my cable modem will give signal level and signal/noise ratio info) and a consistently stronger signal. Used to have problems with the Cisco unit not performing as well during the hot portion of the day (unit mounted in attic) but the Motorola unit is rock solid. The best comment i can make about this unit is that it is essentially invisible, Drop it in and stop thinking about it. Nice product, if it ever dies due to attic heat, i'll buy another immediately."
3,Input/Output ports may be mislabeled,"If you connect this signal booster and the green ""power"" light is on, but you get no signal, then try this. Take the input cable and put it on the output port. And take the output cable and put it on the input port.I could not get this thing to work at all. I checked all cables and connections and traced the problem to the signal booster. I was getting signals in but not out. I was ready to send it back but tried reversing the input and output cables and guess what! Worked like a champ. Apparently someone either mislabeled the device or wired it to the wrong ports in the factory.This shows sloppy quality control and makes me question what else they may have done wrong, but at least it works now."
3,"Good, but not perfect","This product works, it will significantly boost your signal and consequently the number of stations you receive. It is, however, not magic and will not turn a sows ear into a silk purse. I recommend it."
1,"Made reception worse, and now I can't go back.","I connected this booster between the wall outlet and my VCR, but it caused the reception I once had to be considerably worse than before. Before I connected this device, if I did not turn on my VCR, I had wavy lines or grainy pictures on several of my channels. Once I connected the booster, I had terrible reception on ALL my channels. I then removed the device, only to result in no reception! Now, just to get lousy reception, I have to have the booster connected. I have never been so unhappy with a product in my life."
2,Didn't improve cable signal at all,"I installed this unit today, hoping to clear up some of the ""grainy-ness"" introduced by 'splitting off' my cable connection. It did nothing ; there was literally no difference at all in the quality of the picture, on any of the channels. In fact, after I removed the unit, I went to the back of my TV and cable boxes and tightened all the connections. After doing that, the reception did actually improve. So, save your $$ and try doing that first. I can't speak with regards how well this unit work in improving cable modem bandwith as I haven't tried that out yet. (that's why it got 2 stars instead of only 1)"
1,What Product,"Dear Amazon,Thanks for sending my order to the wrong address. I'm glad you are so naive thinking that the people who live at that address are honest and would send something back that they didn't order. So why don't you ask the people who kept the product that I paid for how it works!"
1,had no effect,"I bought this booster with high hopes. My previous one was several years old and had lost a lot of it's effectiveness. When I replaced it with this one I had no picture at all. Mabey it was my set up, or just I need a more specific booster. I went back to my old unit. There is no product information on the case of the old one. I'm going to contact the company that installed my antenna to see if I can get an exact replacement. I guess if you have reception problems - going to an antenna specialist isn't a bad idea.In my case it would have saved time."
1,Worked best out of circuit,"Maybe mine was defective (I returned it, didn't want to waste time trying to get it checked out). My signal was pretty good (analog cable), but went thru a splitter, and was slightly degraded on some stations. With this booster, it was a lot more degraded. I swapped it with a simple male-to-male barrel connector for testing, and the picture was much, much worse with this booster."
1,be careful buying this,"No one in these reviews seem to think it is necessary to tell people that this product only works with converter box for digital signal. I know it doesn't say anywhere on the box that it wont work for direct television hook up, so be careful when buying."
2,Good product if you don't have a cable modem.,"My TV picture improved greatly using this booster, but my cable modem performance downgraded drastically. My cable modem return signal strength degraded, I suffered high packet loss and I was experiencing dropped connections. To fix the problem, I switched to a CHANNEL VISION C-0314 8 Db Rf Amplifier which combines a slitter with an amplifier all in one unit. It has Bi-directional amplifiers. Now I have a great connection for my cable modem and I have a great TV picture at the same time. I also so have a cleaner less cluttered solution in my cable junction box since I don't use any passive splitters now. The Motorola 484095-001-00 Signal Booster should only be used for TV signals or where you have a strong enough return path signal for your cable modem, since this booster does not amplify the return path(it actually degrades it some)."
1,Don't waste your money,"This so called booster blocks the signal, not boosting. I had it hooked up for a month and my signal was terrible, faded in and out etc. Decided to move antenna one day and that didn't help much either so just for the heck of it I removed the booster and signal strength went from 15/17 to 56/72, depending on what channel I was on. I tried this booster where the cable went into the house and within 6 feet of antenna, made no difference. Total waste of money, I had waited to long to return it so it is setting on shelve, I'll sell it for 1/2 price, ha, don't think I will get any takers. Buy a good antenna and be done with it."
5,Does what it says it will do.,"Bought this because I only saw the guide on our digital cable, no picture. After this was installed not only got a great picture but very little lag time switching channels as well as short lag time accessing DVR and On Demand. I have Comcast cable."
4,No miracles but does work..,"I'm pretty sceptical about such devices but I decided to take a chance on this one since I have trouble pulling in some of the clear/unscrambled digital channels with two different QAM tuners.First I tried the easy way and hooked it up inside where the cable comes into the wall from outside. No difference..didn't work. Next I tried it the correct way and went outside and installed it at the earliest place possible (used it instead of a cable co installed 2-way splitter) and WALLAH! I now get the one clear QAM channel I couldn't pull in before! I must say that the picture quality of the channels I was already getting didn't seem to change at all, so if you're looking at this device for that purpose it may or may not work for you."
4,Clear and sharp.,I bought a new plasma and could not get a good signal. Bought the booster and all ten tv's are better than ever. Great produt.
5,Works!,"Trust me, this works well. Plug it in and you'll have a clearer picture. We used this on Comcast digital cable and placed it at the entry point in our home, before the splitter. The effect was immediately noticable and worth the price of the product and 5 minutes it took to setup."
1,"Useless...,","Read the glowing reviews here & thus purchased....Set-up: HD TV with antenna. Some hills here in S.F. Bay Area but signal towers higher & within 2-3 miles.Result: Nothing. Tried everything. Got better reception with the HD RadioShack indoor/outdoor antenna i already had.Perhaps it works better with cable hook-ups BUT it also stated that it would work, nay--- vastly improve my present set-up.Final statement: A major waste of $...."
1,WATCH OUT - MAKES DIRECTV SIGNAL WORSE!,"Followed all instructions to connect where signal comes into house before multiswitch. Made DirecTV signal even grainier!!! Have eight TVs and figured it couldn't hurt to boost DirecTV signal to see if picture would improve. Have not tried from multiswitch to TV. Maybe will work there but then I would need eight of them! Now I have to unplug it and use it for something else. Maybe a paperweight. What a letdown. If you have a near high-end system, forget about it."
1,This thing did nothing,Installed it exactly as directions indicate but there was absolutely no change in the picture quality. I may try hooking it up at the point the cable enters the house and if there is an improvement I'll revise this review but so far it's been a waste of money.
1,this item did not work as advertised.,"this item did not work as advertised, the image was bad and after i removed item and image was bad same way. I returned this item to amazon for full refund, wasted my time for nothing. thanks Motorola for making such bad signal booster."
2,OVERPRICED BUT PERFORMS WELL,"Works as well as cheaper amplifiers you can pick up in the store. I do not have any instrument to measure ""noise"" etc. in the signal but picture quality improvement is comparable only to less expensive amplifiers."
1,Did not work with roof antenna,"This product may work well for some people in some situations, but it did not work at all with my cable TV service transmitted to my rooftop antenna in Barbados - I got 0% improvement in signal strength. However, a tiny cheapo signal booster from the cable company did the trick in the end...kinda makes you go hmmmm."
1,No Difference,Product was easy to hook up as stated but I am still having the same signal problems as I was before I hooked it up.
1,Leak Problems,I was not happy with this product. After installation the local cable company said they could detect a large signal leak from the street oustide. The only way we could correct the signal leak was to disconnect the Motorola signal booster.
2,TV Signal Booster,"The product description needs a lot more information about what it can do. I had a digital signal that was so poor that it was pixelizing and locking up. I assumed that the amplifier would improve it so that it would stop that. It didn't, the picture went away entirely. My satellite service repairman tells me that it couldn't work because it ""overdrove"" the signal out of the tuner range."
3,Motorola Signal Booster,"Received the booster promptly, connected it in 5 minutes and saw immediate results. Quality of channels at the upper end was significantly improved."
4,Customer or Cable Company ?,"I recently added a third cable line in the house, and switched to digital cable. I also have a wireless cable router/modem for my internet access. I immediately found the signal somewhat poorer in the analog channels(probably from the splitter) and dropping out all the time on the digital stations. I was told by our cable company that given the lengths of runs and the older cable in the house, that I may need an amplifier. I installed the motorola device at the cable input to the house (took ten minutes) and it largely removed the dropouts (every few weeks there is still a ""bad reception night"") on the digital side, but did not help the analog much -- I suspect that the problems are related to the quality of the signal that is being presented to the house by the cable company....since it is very channel dependent. There was a noticable improvement in the internet access speed, which was always on the low end of the advertised range."
5,"No more ""this channel will be available shortly""!!!","I live in an old apartment bldg where the cable has been split multiple times, and when I upgraded to digital cable several stations would not come in due to the weakened signal, plus sometimes I could not even connect to On Demand. This signal booster immediately took care of the problems, now everything works like it should. I have it running into a splitter, half of which goes to my modem, and it does not interfere with the internet signal at all. Just keep in mind when you install this you will need to be near a power outlet. Save yourself hassling with the cable company and pick this up if you are having weak signal problems!"
4,Cable Modem Doesn't Like The Boost,"Too many splitters were degrading my cable signal. This booster installed without a hitch, and my television and digital phone clarity increased immediately. However, my cable modem was unable to start/maintain a live Internet connection, even when connected directly to the booster. To fix this, I connected the modem to yet another coax splitter to cut the boost back down. Now things are working great. **** because it did the polar opposite of what it promised for my cable Internet signal."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product to help clear your tv signal. I went from a relatively grainy picture on my HD tv (analog signal) to a much clearer, smooth picture.It also helped my other tvs through the house. Fantastic product, and yes...I was a bit skeptical."
4,Just a skosh more reception,"I'm one of those people who doesn't have cable. Nor do I want a huge antenna on my roof. Instead, I stuck a UHF antenna in the attic and adjusted its position so all major stations in the area came in clearly on my TV. Then the local ABC station moved its antenna. On most days their signal turned marginal at best.I bought this item as a cheap fix. It adds just enough signal strength to pull in the station that used to break up on my digital TV. Occasionally, the atmospheric conditions are such that this booster isn't enough. But usually it works.The item is very easy to install and takes up little space. No it isn't a miracle worker, but if you need just a skosh more signal, this item will do the trick. It you aren't already getting a signal, I very much doubt this item will prove to be of value."
5,improved DTV converter box to receive broadcast signal,good product - it enables me to receive all broadcast signal form NYC. I have an outdoor antenna in addition it. It located in a heavy tall wooded area and 40 miles from NYC.
5,It is fantastic,"It resolved ALL our cable reception problems on all my TVS (6).It eliminated ghosts, double/fuzzy images and noise. I believe the cable input is intentionally weak so the cable company can charge you for additional TVs because when you ask for reception service the first question from the serviceman is: """"How many TVs are hooked up to their service"""". This product is worth ever penny it beats paying the cable company $5.00/month per TV.I would highly recommend this product to any one with reception problems. I installed it before all my splitters and it boosted the signal to ALL my TVS some are over 100 feet away."
1,Just did not work,"Maybe I bought a bad one, but this thing did not work at all. I have way too many splitters, and I thought this would help. At first I installed it before the first splitter, and it had no effect. Then I figured I'd install it directly behind the TV I was having problems with just to see of it did anything. It did not even put the signal through of the channels I was getting in from before. It seems as if no signal even passes through. Shouldn't at least the few channels I did get stay on? I am returning ASAP."
2,Didn't help,"I was hoping that the signal booster would help clear up some cable channels that have fuzzy pictures, so I bought it and installed it on the cable at the entry point to the house. It didn't help with any of the cable channels.I was also hoping that it would help with my cable modem intermittently dropping connections. It seems to actually cause more problems with the cable modem. When the signal booster is not attached, the cable modem works far more frequently than when the signal booster is attached.Also, it is shipped with cheap rg59 coaxial cables, one of which seemed to have a bad connection. I tried better quality replacement cables, but that didn't help either. I wish it had done better, but I can't give it a good review."
2,Wishful thinking,"When ultimately granpa's tv failed to get a signal, we took it out of the system and found his TV got equal and possibly better reception without it! I'd have to characterize this device as wishful thinking... but I can't say we ever benefited from spending the monies on it."
4,Works well,Second time bought it since the old one was zapped by lightning. Works well with cable internet modem and TV reception.
1,Horrible! Actually degraded signal.,"Actually degraded signal! Got it in hopes of improving a couple of marginal channels. Instead, it made things far worse. Couldn't even receive most of the channels that I received just fine without it. Unfortunately I didn't get around to installing for a while after I ordered it, so too late to return."
2,Failed after changing wall outlets,"Worked well until I recently moved it from one wall outlet to another. Then it totally failed, except that the green power light was still on indicating it was receiving power. Had it 6 months when it failed."
5,amazing product,"Initially, I had a low expectation on this item since I was using Radioshack cable signal booster without any much improvement. Glad, I was wrong!Installation is very easy:Main source --> 2-1 switch (to cable modem & Motorola signal booster) --> Motorola --> 2-1 switch (to farthest HDTV & 5-1 switch).After connecting this item, all of my six HDTVs are displaying a superb picture quality, and cable internet connection is so fast. Amazing product, and highly recommended!"
2,Check your TV tuner as well as cable connections,"This product may be great in areas with weak signals, but my experience was different through no fault of the product. When our tv hdtv tuner was having difficulty pulling in PBS and ABC, I thought it could be weak signals. Long story short, the problem lies with the tv tuner, as we tested other tuners (TIVO and a DVD recorder) using the same OTA antenna --- no problems. The unit actually did little to change reception from those two stations. Thus, we returned it. Ironically, after the DTV transition, both problem stations migrated their hdtv signals to a different frequency and now there are hardly any reception problems."
2,"Worked on some channels, messed up the rest","This amp worked OK on my fuzzy channels, clearing them up somewhat...but in the process it over-drove the channels that were clear to begin with and made them fuzzy.It wasn't worth it to me to lose those clear channels, so I returned this device."
5,Used with Antenna Reception,"I used this product to help with antenna reception. I do not have cable. It worked great! Before CBS, which is channel 2 in my area, was full of snow. At different times of the day you could not see or hear the station. Now that I have used this I can always see the channel, and the other stations come through with amazing sharpness (I didn't know it could be that good.) Channel 2 does still have snow sometimes, but the fact that it always comes through and we don't have to try and make out fuzzy shapes when we want to watch our favorite CBS shows made the family very happy. I also installed an FM trap to reduce the occassional hering bone effect from some local signal. You can install this where you attenna comes into the house, but we have it installed near the TV."
5,This thing really works!,"Before hooking this amplifier up, quite a few of my cable channels would come in horribly. They were very grainy - a sure sign of poor signal strength. In most cases, this is caused by having too many splitters. I didn't know how well this would work, but I took a gamble and bought it. I'm glad I did. It instantly fixed my problem, and now all of my channels come in crystal clear. Just remember, it's crucial that you place the booster as close as possible to where the cable enters the house. This booster even gives you the strength to drive splitters, so you want to place the splitters after the output of this amp."
4,Works as advertised,"It does permit movies-on-demand as advertised. It was easy to install. I'm not sure why the supply is through the same kind of shielded cable using the same shielded connector as the signal connections - I suppose to shield the power supply input as well, but it is a bit strange.I occasionally see pixelated output on the TV screen, but this could be the cable company's problem.The one reviewer's picture of the device out of the packaging was very useful.I would recommend this booster to anyone."
2,a real disappointment,"I live 7 miles from Springfield Missouri and the digital signals were freezing up regularly. I have a fairly high roof antenna, no cable or dish. And I could not get public tv at all on one of my tvs. So I purchased this device with high hopes. My 2 tvs still freeze up and I still can't get public tv on one of the two tvs. I was very disappointed in this so called signal amplifier."
1,Busted after 2 months,"Didn't really notices much gain from this if/when it did work. But I was having issues with my cable and the technician came out and tested it - told me it was doing more harm than good. Apparently I wanted something close to 0 (hertz or something?) but it was giving me -16. When we took it out, it went back to 0.So, junk in my opinion."
2,Motorola Signal Booster,"Can't really rate this item. I live in a basement apartment surrounded by other tall brick buildings and mature trees that block the signals. I connected it according to the instructions and got a screen full of snow. I reconnected the bunny ears and the picture returned to ""normal."" So, in my case, it didn't work, not even a tiny bit. It may work for others in a basement apartment if they don't have alot of objects blocking the signals."
2,Marginal,I'm in a fringe area and I experienced a 5% to 10% boost in signal strength after installing this unit. Not enough to solve the problems.
1,Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 Bi-Directional RF Amplifier,"Purchased in the hope of improving digital channel reception in the country, ~60 miles from the broadcasting stations. While there was some improvement, it was far from significant. Increased the percentage of time two of the channels come in, but they sill do not come in all the time. It did not add any additional channels. Bottom line, switching to digital resulted in worse reception than analog and boosting the signal, at least with this booster, had limited effect. If any one does find something that works, please post. Thanks"
3,Not sure if it works.,I have tried this in our RV and tried it with our cox cable connection. I really do not see much difference. Maybe I am not using it for the right application.
2,It doesn't work -- Period.,"I tried this on my Comcast cable system. I even bought the Monster 2GHZ splitters, which in fact DO work well, but this so-called ""booster"" just boosts electrical noise on all 3 of my TVs. It's funny -- Comcast says I ""must"" have one of these on my system ( one of THEIRS, I suppose ), but after 3 tries with it I just gave up. My pictures are clearer without it and it doesn't even make a good doorstop."
2,Quite disappointed,"I am experiencing what seems to be a weak signal - especially for the digital channels (my HDTV gives me a signal strength of 75% with frequent pixelation and sound dropping out). After reading the reviews and the product description I decided to purchase the signal booster.Although the analog channels seem slightly better, the digital channels dropped from 75% signal to about 60% and they are now too bad to watch. When I simply unplug the power supply to the booster, the signal goes back to 75%. So my digital picture quality is definitely worse with the signal booster turned on - quite disappointed. I might have to call Comcast although I don't have high hopes for them to help me out."
1,Not Worth It,I bought this signal booster to see if it would help with enhancing the digital signal and it made it worse. I returned it and I would NOT recommend it.
2,May work but not for me.,"I ordered this item with great expectations for boosting the signal into my home. Nice looking unit that appears to be well built. Unfortunately, the unit did very little to improve the signal to my cable box. I have used a radio shack variable gain amplifier before that worked wonders at a previous home. The Motorola may be a good amplifier, but it did not work for me."
5,Best Signal Booster !!,I purchased this signal booster to push the cable signal approx 300ft from my house to the barn. Before installing the booster I was unable to receive any channel above channel 8 at the barn. Now it goes all the way to channel 70 with a great picture. I could not believe my eyes when I seen the dramatic change in picture quality. This device is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone having trouble with a snowy picture or trying to send the signal to multiple TV's. I have not tried it yet with my Comcast Cable WiFi due to there is only only one output. I am planning on purchashing a second booster for this purpose. Also this booster is very simple to install and comes with everything required to install a single signal boost. Buy this and you won't be dissapointed !! Also note that it is bi-directional which allows you to use this booster with a cable modem.
2,not very effective,"I bought this item on the advice of a friend who said that it would boost the signal and clarity for my HDTV. After 3 weeks of use, I have not noticed any improvement on the pixelation of my HD programming nor a boost in the signal strength/consistency with our wireless devices."
4,works as advertised,Easy to install. Works well. No complaints. Decent (not great) value. Works better than the first amplifier (different brand) that I purchased.
4,Works as it should,"Allows me to connect four TVs to an attic mounted antenna using a 1 to 4 splitter. I could have purchased the model with the built in splitter, but since I had a splitter, I decided to save money. The amplifiers are exactly the same. Installation was easy. Having to use a RG6 cable for power is both good and bad. If you have one or can make one then you can determine the length. If you have to buy one, then there's extra cost."
1,Ineffective with Leaf indoor antenna.,"While the motorola signal booster has received overwhelming praise from hundreds of customers, I found that when used as an antenna signal booster it had no effect upon the signals. Finally, after two days of repositioning and retesting reception I returned it to Amazon (who are an amazing company in accepting and processing returns). I have no doubt that as a booster for cable boxes it works well. My one star rating is strictly based on its effectiveness in having the same effect on boosting digital HD antenna signals."
1,Does Not Work To Boost Satellite TV Signal From The Dish,"This unit is not made or intended to be used to boost a weak signal from your satellite dish if you have a long run like we do. After hooking this up, we had NO tv at all. Motorola apologized for not mentioning this and Amazon gave a refund less postage. It will however boost a regular cable tv signal or boost a long run to a tv in another part of the house or to your neighbor next door."
5,Great Signal Booster,"When I put it inline it immediately boosted the signal at my TV. The Comcast guy said there was nothing he could do, that there was a splitter ot two somewhere in the wall, but this fixed it in a second. Typical top notch Motorolla quality."
1,Motorola Signal Booster - Didn't work for cable modem,"I bought this product to boost our Internet connection. Description said that it will improve cable modem signal. However, when I connected this device, our Internet connection completely stopped.I tried it a couple of times. Without the device, I can get to the Internet (albeit at an unsatisfactory speed). With the device, no connection at all.So, I returned the product to Amazon."
5,Works as it should,"This product does exactly what it says it does and should. It is to be installed directly in-line at the entry point of the home, and it helps when signal levels are low throughout the house due to multiple splits, or due to long or high-loss wiring. I have tried others (e.g. R@dio Sh@ack), and they did not work anywhere near was well.This is the one to get if you have digital cable and/or cable internet!"
5,Wroks for what I needed - Over the Air HD,"I purchased this to replace my original Radio Sh@K mast mounted signal booster after it was taken out by a lightning strike. Without the mast mounted unit, which cost twice as much as the Moto Unit and failed, I was unable to pick up any of my over the air HD channels. Since I live out in the country and my station's transmitters are 25 to 30 miles away I need a booster to get any signal along the HD line. Even standard def is sketchy at times without some kind of booster. After installing the Motorola 484095-001-00 signal booster, everything works even better than my old mast mounted unit ever did. 5 stars! Easy to install, and no need to climb on my roof (Except to bypass my old mast mounted unit) and the price at Amazon was $20.00 less than the brick and mortar stores even with shipping!"
1,not designed to improve TV reception,"I can barely get a TV signal, so I got this Motorola thing, which did no good. But the Motorola tech support guy said yesterday this was designed to boost the signal for a long cable run, not to improve reception for over-the-air TV. He was surprised it's being marketed this way. He said my problem is not a *weak* signal from the antenna but a *bad* signal. The Terk HDTVa works great, however. Apparently Terk's in-line signal amplifier (little black box that goes along the antenna signal cable) does more than just boost--maybe it cleans the signal too? Another possibility is that the Motorola booster is just boosting too much, which distorts the signal, like an overly-loud radio, and the gentler Terk booster is all I need."
4,Much better,"Cannot use this with broadband internet or VOIP such as comcast digital voice. However, it does meaningfully increase signal quality and signal strength on the TV side. I have this in front of 2 4-way splitters and each TV behind this device saw a marked increase in signal quality. With or without the comcast cable box. Also, onDemand still works, in fact works better on the TV behind 2 splitters and about 200 feet from cable post in the street. Would buy this again."
1,Not worth the money,My signal strength went from 86-88 to 87-89. Not worth the electricity it uses. And what is up with the RG59 cables? Anybody who is serious about signal quality will only use RG6. It is being sent back for a refund.
2,Didn't work for me,I have comcast highspeed internet and digital cable. I wanted to use my PC as a PVR so I ran a 9 ft coax cable to my PC. I couldn't get a signal with the SageTV software but it works with WinTV that comes with my tuner card. So I thought this booster will help - it didn't. I'm still not able to detect signal in SageTV.
1,Did not work at all.,"Connected all the wires and plugged it in. It did not work at all. Now, I have to return it.Does cold weather effect it? The UPS guy just dropped it off. I waited for it to warm up. Did the freeze damage it?"
5,Worked as promised,"Excellent product. Before installing the booster, I had ""snow"" on several channels. After installing the booster, every channel comes in clear."
3,Motorola Signal Booster,Great for boosting incoming signal.However I was under the impresison this would allow signal back through for things like On-Demand or 2 way communication needed for a cable modem. This was not the case.Neather Cable Modem or On-Demand would work through this booster.
2,Doesn't really help antennae reception...,"I have an outdoor boosted TV antennae that didn't quite get enough signal for a couple of local stations to the TV in the den, the longest cable run in the house. The picture would pixelate and/or cut out every once in a while. I put on this booster and it seems to help slightly, but I still get an occassional pixillation or cutting out."
2,Works great! (For 5 Months),"Really helped on the picture quality. Unfortunately, it only lasted six months. Called motorola and they are very nice and efficient. They would honor the warranty but it would not be worth it in time and money to do it so I am buying a new one from someone else."
2,"Worked for 3 months, then stopped.","After about three months of excellent signal quality and smooth Internet connection, the TV closest to the device stopped getting a clear signal. Every other TV and modem in the house was working great - but the first one in the house along the splitter chain (and after the booster) wasn't getting anything.I switched out various cables and splitters, and the only thing that would improve the signal was removing the signal booster completely.I called Motorola, who insisted that it was all somehow my fault. Their ultimate conclusion was that the signal was being OVER-amplified at that first TV. I don't know much about cable signals, so I don't know if this is true, but now I have a very expensive signal booster that I can't hook up anywhere. It was great while it lasted, but Motorola's refusal to acknowledge this problem, whatever it is, is very disappointing."
2,Didn't Work,The ad and reviews suggested this unit as a booster for RF Antennas capturing HD signals without Cable. It actually made the signal worse.
1,Old 10db booster better then this over rated one,Old 10db booster better then this over rated one. Was extremely disappointed after installing this one and removing what was supposed to be a weaker booster. Put the old 10db one back in--twice the signal amplification of this Motorola model. Might just be a lemon but I can not recommend it because of my experience.
4,Very Good Product,The area i live in has a bunch of apt running off of one cable line. I originally purchased a signal booster from radio shack. Unsatisfied with it i did some research and saw all the good reviews on this product. Pretty much lives up to the good reviews. Most channels the signal is perfect with only a few upper channels a lil bit fuzzy. Excellent improvement tho. Im very happy with this purchase and would buy it again.
5,Does the job,"I purchased one of these units many years back to improved my analog cable signal strength due to splits and broadband usage. It worked well.Recently we decided to bring a digital broadcast antenna signal into the house but my TV's QAM tuner wasn't getting good signal strength, using this created a vast improvement. Would recommend."
5,Improves Over-the-Air HD signal,"This product really helped improve my Over-the-Air HD signal. I'm using a Terk HDTVi indoor settop antenna, living on top of a hill about 30 - 35 miles from TV transmission antennas. With the Motorola Signal Booster in place, I did not pick up any new stations, but the stations whose signals were formerly marginal are now rock solid, no more dropouts or pixelating."
5,Motorola 484095-001-00 signal booster,After connecting a DVD/vcr device to my cable TV the picture quality was degraded. We tried non powered splitters and different wireing but nothing helped. After installing the signal booster the picture quality was as good or better than before.
5,Good signal booster,Worked great out of the box. Now our motorola modem has a steady connection.Make sure you check your splitters also.
1,Did not work at all,"I tried the product with 2 tvs in the house that needed some signal boost. It did not work at all on either of them, and it deminished picture quality on every tv in the house when hooked up. I tried on the main line and on other lines, it made no difference.I do not recommend."
1,Motorola Signal Booster for Digital HD Signal,"If you would like to solve the problem of a signal break in a digital signal for an HD TV over a roof top antenna, this Motorola Signal Booster will have little or no effect. It appears to be made to improve an analog signal."
1,Bad out of the box,Item was received open and not working(Possible used). I had paid for a new item. Event through they ship this item to me in this condition they refuse to pay for return shiping. Amazon.com and Vicom_Electronice will not take responsibility for return shiping. Do yourself a favor don't buy prouducts from these company. Not customer friendly.
3,Input A/C,"I bought this Signal Booster for usage in Singapore. The A/C input does not support 240V.Secondly, the input power connector on the Signal Booster is the same as the signal in or out which is not a good idea. There is a chance that the end user may connect the power into the signal connection (which I did).However, the Booster did improve and increased the signal level."
2,Not Worth the Time or Effort,"Just got a HD TV and the picture for non-HD channels was poor via Brighthouse. Tried this booster at various spots in the path to the TV and it made little difference. The problem is most likely the cable company, but didn't see this helping."
4,signal booster,I have an outdoor VHF/UHF directional antenna and used the booser to get some of the weaker digital stations to come in better. It's not as strong as I had hoped but better than they were before. It seems the winter weather creates some of the problems because when the weather is good all the stations come in strong with no pixeling.
5,Great Unit,Had ongoing problems with a weak signal on a spliiter. Tried several other boxes.All the channels except one improved dramatically with this unit.Highly recommended.
2,Not working,"Well, I got this booster about a week ago. I tried to install it in several locations inside and outside the house and it didn't give me any better signal."
5,Good product!,This signal booster made getting all of the digital stations in our area dependable and clear. We had two stations that did not come in before purchase. The motorola signal booster is well worth the money.
5,Good amplifier. Works well,This turns out to be a good amplifier. Helped bring in numerous free-space signals and made them sharper and more watchable
5,Superb aid to understanding Romans,"We have been studying Romans in our bible study group, and I have been using Hendriksen, Bruce and Schreiner to help me to understand the text we are trying to come to grips with. The other 2 writers are helpful, but Schreiner is superb. As has been stated before, he is excellent at explaining the flow of the argument.I find that he nearly always answers the questions I am asking, and very often, makes me see things I would never have noticed without his assistance.If you already have this work and enjoy it, you may also find his Pauline Theology, ""Paul: apostle of God's glory in Christ"" very beneficial. I have also greatly appreciated The Race Set Before Us, which he co-authored with Ardel Caneday."
4,Carrie C.,I really like this book because you see life from a cat'spoint of veiw. When the cat has been turned into a man.
4,A full-figure romance that as light as chocolate meringue,"Ms. Manees' full-figure heorine Sameerah, a no nonsense singer/songwriter/musician is a lady (accent on the word), who is quick with the verbal comeback. Speaking of comebacks, Tony is hoping his is a success and Sam will be his. Chantal is a nasty adversary who I also pitied. The characters breathes life in Raynetta's clever hands. Ms. Manees succinctly portrays stardom as a result of hard work, full of stress and joy. Positive messages abound and is woven cleverly into the story with a flair that is the author's trademark. The cruise and Carribean settings makes me contemplate a trip even though I cannot afford a stateroom.I read it more that once, making it a book to savor. A novel to get away from it all. Another winner by Raynetta Manees."
5,Another winner,"The story of Sam and Tony was so much fun to read. I love that the setting was on a cruiseship, since I am getting ready to go on a cruise myself. I have enjoyed all of Ms Manees books. I love how she mixes entertainers and having them find love. I especially like the full figured Sam who could hold her own with the best of them. Please, don't make Sam have to correct you like she did Tree's woman!"
2,love it but !,i loved it and it lasted maybe 6 months and then my 19 month old son broke the strap to that is used to rest his feet on. Now what am i supposed to do with it???
1,please do NOT buy this stroller,"I purchased this stroller about 6 months ago for my then 12 month old son. It was a decent stroller for the price. However, this past week, my son, now 18 months, was sitting in the stroller when the seat fabric ripped. The rip was down the side of the seat causing my son to fall backwards and into the hole in the fabric where his head became lodged. I had to literally cut the rest of the seat off in order to get his head out of it. Thankfully he is fine, minus a cut on his ear. I, of course, was not so fine and promptly called Kolcraft upon returning home. They were non-apologetic and could have cared less about my son's safety. After some badgering, they offered to send me a new seat. No thanks, I'll find a new stroller..."
2,Cute little stroller,"I bought this for my 13 month old son who is quite big for his age thinking it would be a breeze to get in and out of the car. It is nice and light and folds up super easy but my boy is too big for it. He squishes in and if he squiggles forward he can actually walk and pull the stroller behind him! The sun canopy just got in the way of the easy folding so I took it off the first day I used it. The cup holder is great and the bag could hold your keys. I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend because it is small but I have never tried any other umbrella strollers, maybe they are all small. It is cute and I like the blue."
1,Dangerously Unsafe Product,"Instruction Manual indicates stroller can be folded with canopy closed, but not removed. When we tried that, the canopy bracket could not hold under the tension and the canopy whipped into my wife's face. We contacted Kolcraft to request advice. We were advised that the Manual was written to cover a variety of models, and our particular model should not be folded with the canopy in place. This advice came AFTER my wife was injured.We returned this shoddy product for a refund and suggest others follow our lead in avoiding all Kolcraft products. The extremely unsafe Kolcraft practice of publishing instruction manuals that do not match product features will not injure another member of my family."
4,On the go Mom,"This stroller was a gift to us for our 12 month old son. We are very happy with it! We live in a large city in Europe with lots of traffic so naturally I walk with my son a lot of places. This stroller has proven to be a great convenience...it folds up quickly and easily. Very practical for travel or for being on the go. I would agree with one of the other reviews that the stroller does not recline as much as I would like, but it is still very functional."
2,Don't waste your money,"We bought this stroller because it seemed like a good, middle of the road, umbrella stroller. It wasn't the freebie one, but it also wasn't over $100. I should not have wasted my money. First of all, this stroller is NOT for tall parents. You will constantly be kicking the wheels and hunching over to push the stroller. I am 5'9"" and my husband is 6'2"". I can barely stand to push it, and my husband would rather carry our daughter for miles than push this thing. Secondly, the material is flimsy. After only a few months of sparse usage, it started to tear right by by daughter's shoulders. A month or so later the holes were so big that I didn't feel safe putting her in it anymore. I sucked it up and bought a Britax Blink for $69 on another website. It is amazing how much better that one is! They don't even compare."
2,Interesting but not enough,"Psycobiograghies are new in genre, but they may be enlightening, provided the subject that is being studied is analysed deeply.So, to write a similar kind of work regarding so complex a man as was Richard Nixon requires a good amount of knowledge about his life, his personal and political choices and particularly the latter for the very reason that are the most delicate : how can this be accomplished with a book a mere 149 pages ? Inevitably the informations here given verge on the general and the analysis done seems to be a little bit amateurish. Although the book is good to read, it certainly does not say the last word on Nixon'personality - not in the least !In the end, I appreciate the choice of having chosen former president Nixon as a subject, but that would have required a very bigger work, at least three times as big as the size of the present book."
3,Have to admit,"This series is alright but, it gets kinda boring at this point. The worse part is that the English dubbing is horrible, the Americans don't know how to dubbed good japanese anime. I not Japanese to let you know. but Ken totally sounds like a beach retarded fool, Ryu doesn't sound aggressive enough, Vega is just totally off the royal rocker(in a bad tone). Whatever you do, get the original japanese version."
1,Never got it,"I wait for a month and i never got it. If the company doesnt have the book, DO NOT SALE."
5,"""Metro Music""",I am completely obsessed with 311. By far my favorite band i am listening to them right now as i write this. when i heard the lead singer's brother was a making music i checked it out. i was amazed at how different it was. yet still incredible. some how the Hexum family has managed to corner just about every type of music. This is great 'metro music' if you will and is very very well done.
4,"It works unbelievably well, but has BHT.","I got a sample of this from the Pediatrician's office and could NOT believe how well it worked! Almost every other moisturizer on the market makes your hands feel more dried out 5 minutes after you use it. This stuff really works BUT they use BHT as a preservative (synthetic, carcinogenic) and so I have to cross if off MY list, but maybe you don't. I WILL continue to buy their soaps because they are wonderful, pure, lathery and do not contain BHT and are perfect for people with senstivities."
2,did nothing for me,"i purchased because of its good reviews hoping that it would calm my eczema, unfortunately, i found cetaphil to be more useful ;/"
4,Great!,Works well at a great price! Would order it again! Used it on baby. Seems to be helping her eczema but still some areas are still not getting better.
3,4 oz size is stupid!,"The cream itself is great, but why do they make a 4 oz tube, (which is obviously meant as travel size) when the carry-on rules for airlines is 3 oz or smaller? I cannot travel with this travel size, and airplane air is so dry that I need to bring moisturizer in my carryon. Please make a 3 oz size! 4 oz is too big for travel and too small for home use. It's a pointless size. I use the large pump container for home use. Now I have to repackage the cream into a travel size jar, which is very messy."
5,Vanicream,I was told by our dermatologist that Vanicream is the best moisturizer for us as it does not have preservatives like formaldehye etc that can cause severe skin reactions.It a a terrific moisturizer for a reasonable price.
5,Works great!!,"I have eczema every winter. I got it on my face this year, GREAT! I usually use Eucerin, but it was not helping it, so I looked online and found Vanicream. Within 24 hours of using it, I noticed a dramatic improvement in the eczema, and in 48 hours it was gone. This will be my new skin cream now."
5,Great for sensitive skin!,My doctor told me to buy this....couldn't find it in a store but Amazon had it. Got it quickly and it works great!
5,Fantastic product & very economical,"Until about 15 years ago when a dermatologist advised me to use Vanicream, my face was so dry in the winter, that no matter how well I moisturized at night, I'd wake up with itchy red patches all over my face. After using Vanicream for about 3 weeks, my face was completely clear and the itching was gone...forever! Per my dermatologist, I apply to my face prior to applying my makeup base, it makes my makeup go on smoothly and evenly. After washing my face before going to bed, I use Vanicream again, on my face and neck, using extra around my eyes & even rub some into my eyelashes, to keep them conditioned. I am 60 years old and am constantly told I look at least 10 years younger (I have almost no wrinkles). I thank Vanicream for this, as all the other women in my family have wrinkled badly and pretty early. Also, compare the price of this with other moisturizers, Vanicream is a real bargain. Without a doubt, this is the best ""cosmetic"" product I have ever used!"
5,Severe eczema sufferer,"I have suffered from SEVERE eczema on my hands for many years. I have tried Cetaphil, Eucerin, Aveeno, Aquaphor, Vaseline, and many other creams and lotions. This is by far the best one. The cream works perfectly when you put it on right after a shower or after you wash your hands because it keeps that moisture in. It's not greasy and it doesn't just stay on the surface of your skin. Obviously it doesn't cure the eczema, but it certainly keeps my skin moist and my itching at a minimum! This is now my daily moisturizer for my body AND my face. I love it."
3,Not Too Greasy on The Feet,"I was hoping this really thick lotion will cure my dry cracking heels. It helps some by preventing my dry heals from getting any drier and hurt, but it does not completely alleviate the dry heels. Keri lotion works better, but does not last as long and is much greaser than this Vanicream."
3,recommended by the pediatrician...,"but leaves a tacky feeling which my son disliked, and did nothing to alleviate his itchy skin, so we stopped using it all together."
3,"Good, not great.","If you have eczema, then you have to use this product pretty regularly to see any results."
4,"Excellent, but beware!","To be honest, without this book, I would have certainly failed ""Programming Introduction"", a course I had to attend last semester. This book teaches you everything you need to know about such a complex language as Scheme, giving you deep and abstract examples of recursion. At the end, you will be able to solve the toughest problems using all the elements recursion has to offer, thus making your programs easy and short. However, you must beware of the following. This book has a high technical language, and sometimes, the examples get too complex for one to understand. If you have some experience in programming, this a must for you! However, if you are beginning to programm, or if you are too used to iteration, you can get into this book but will find some trouble understanding some of the recursive structures. However, learning a level of Scheme complexity like the one this book teaches will help you get used to some commands that many other books don't even mention."
5,loved it,"Not only did the table cloth come a month ahead of the projected shipping date, it was even better quality than I imagined. I don't think you can see it in the picture but there is a trim along the bottom. The trim is rope-like. I bought this as a gift and the recipient was very happy."
2,Picture,"Pleases, show me the picture about Targus Slim Line Style 200 Leather Deluxe Portfolio Notebook Caseby Targus."
4,Looking over their shoulders?,"I listened to the new Chieftains CD for the first time last night. After their recent ""other roads taken"" albums - all of which I enjoyed immensely - I thought it curious they would return to their roots.But then, it being the season, so to speak, I put my two Solas CDs on. I found myself wondering if the boys were looking over their shoulders, and deciding they weren't ready yet to yield the floor.A pity. If the music on this CD is a delicate crystal goblet, then Solas is the soprano that walks into the room and shatters it with her voice. Kevin Coneff steals this CD from his lads, but the instrumentals lack the fire of their younger challengers.One of the interesting developments in Chieftains CDs is the graphic ""branding"" that's going on with the jackets. The graphic team that does these little books is rather spectacular. I'm casting a write-in ballot to make O'Mara and Ryan the first honorary Chieftains.Worth owning, not top shelf."
3,mikes swearing scooter,i think this item is good designed apart form that as it is a childs product can any 1 tell me why it swears after he gets bug in his face... i took mine back for a refund i think its disgusting a disney prduct would do this
2,Uneven and disappointing,"I hate to make the first review a poor one, but Sherman Alexie appears to have been slightly off his game when he selected these. One of the stories, ""Lowell's Class,"" is well worth reading, but the others, while they show promise on the part of the authors, are pretty uninspiring. One wonders whether these writers are tailoring their prose to please strict workshop teacher, or whether workshops simply encourage denatured, Raymond Carver-esque prose. There's a definite bias toward the misery of the young in these selections, and a couple of them are simply poor (""Amreeki"" is incomprehensible, and ""Judas Kiss"" just plain awful.) I hope these writers discover their natural voices--I don't see much of that here."
5,Perfect book for that preteen,"I was looking for a book that was not so detailed that it read like a text book, but had enough substance to answer the questions a preteen may have. As a mom I read through it myself first for appropriateness and then gave it to my 9 year old. Initially he skimmed through it and read only the parts he wanted. However, I find that he does go back to it periodically as a reference when needed. Sometimes the book provided him the answers he was looking for and other times it was just the starting grounds for a talk. Either way it is serving its purpose."
3,Not intact friendly,"This book should go along with active parental guidance. It does provide an overview and answers to some questions but not comprehensive. Some terms are mentioned but never explained. Some information such as oral and anal sex seems over the top for a book geared towards pre teens. What really bothered me was the misinformation on circumcision. The book centers on the circumcised penis as being normal, provides incorrect information about foreskin function, washing and phimosis and uses the term ""uncircumcised"". The book needs to be updated to meet the needs of the current generation which has much lower circumcision rates."
3,Good as a reference except certain pages. But guide you son!,"We were looking for a book for our son similar to The Care & Keeping of You: The Body Book for Girls (American Girl Library) that we bought for our daughter, and this book seems to be one of the best. We bought 2, one for our son and one for a realtive, but when we received it, we found that there are materials on some pages that are objectionable or against our regligion. We returned one copy and kept one.Overall the book is a good reference except the masturbate part. It implies that it is not normal to not masturbate, and the only negative to masturbating a lot is not having time for other things. Medical materials note that masturbating a lot can negatively affect the bowel movement and other organs in the body, too.The book also talk about oral and anal sex, which might not be appropriate to your early teens. We plan to guide our son through these objectionable pages."
4,Great information about a confusing time:,I bought this book for my son. I have read the entire thing cover to cover and have decided that he is only ready for some of the material at this point. He will be allowed to read the whole thing in a year or two. This book gives great info on health and hygiene as well as changes in the body during puberty. There are comments about becoming sexually active that I am not comfortable with at this point but I think that may just be because I don't think my son is old enough for the details.I do recommend this book but encourage parents to read it and decide for themselves if their son(s) should read the whole thing or not.
3,dissappointed,"The book has great info, except the seller who sent it I contacted via email because there were 10 or so pages torn out in the center of the book.. They still have not responded."
3,"It's got some good, and some not so good","Great information, presented at their level. HOWEVER... there are things in there that I objected to, especially boy on boy crushes. Not what we expected. We will, however, use it to speak about morality all the way around.Curfew and a few other things kind of get off topic, and are not something that this book should be interfering with as far as parenting goes. We felt that it was trying to do so."
1,Not what I expected,"I previewed this book before giving it to my son, and I'm glad I did. For the most part, the book was fine, but when discussing sexuality, the authors didn't even mention chastity or morals. I was disappointed. But I recognize this is a secular book, and so I chose not to give it to my son."
2,Seller did not send what was promised,"I am extremely disappointed that this vendor lists not once, but TWICE, that the Trumpette socks come in the signature Trumpette box. My order arrived in a plastic bag. No box. No packing slip with information on how to contact the vendor to request that they send the box that the socks were advertised in. I am extremely disappointed as I was planning to give them as a shower gift. I will be returning them."
2,wrong address,"sorry for this, but by a mistake i didn't change my address and it went to my old apt. what should i to?"
4,Quality material and CUTE!,"We received a lot of compliments on these socks! They also have hoses. More importantly, they stay on! They do run a bit small. Don't wash in warm temperature. Minicoop had ""cankles""..still does :p. We love them so much, we ordered mulitple sizes."
4,Cute cute cute!,"Adorable socks on my daughter and we bought a few as gifts for other newborns. My only complaint is that they slip down easily, so I was always stopping to yank them back up when they were halfway off her feet."
4,Adorable,"I have given these as gifts before and just received them myself for my baby girl. She is not quite 3 months though and has pretty much outgrown them. The positives are that they are darling and stay on her feet. They are just now starting to slide off because they are just about too small. I wish they came in more sizes. I think I will order the next size up since they are cute. With my older two kids, I only did white socks since they get lost in the wash so easily... This will be a splurge. I think they are a good gift."
5,Adorable Socks!,"I have a 4-month old daughter and received these as a gift and we love them! we also have the Trumpette Pixie socks (white sock, with colored slipper, with bow). I think I get more compliments on her socks than any of her outfits. I just ordered these for a friend who just found out she's having a girl. It may seem a bit pricey for socks, but they are really cute and make an excellent gift! The sizing is a bit misleading. My 4-month old is starting to grow out of these socks already, so I wouldn't count on them lasting 0-12 months as the size indicates. I've heard the Trumpette socks for toddlers also run a bit small, so I'll likely order some of those soon for my 4-month old."
4,Great but small,"These are great socks! So cute and they actually stay on the baby's feet. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is b/c they run really small. Once you wash them, you'll be lucky to get them on your 6 month old. I wish they made these in a bigger size!"
4,addictive socks!!!!!,"Great socks, very cute. Like anything they do experience wear and tear. I think the size is 0-12 month, but I was able to use them for half that time."
5,Very cute socks,I love these socks! They are adorable. They held up well and washed well until she outgrew them.
5,So Cute!,"I was given two pairs of these Mary Jane socks as shower gifts and have now purchased them for all my frineds who are having girls. They are so cute. People always stop me to tell me how cute my daughter's shoes are. I have to explain they are just socks and then they suddenly become ever more cute. They fit great, she is still wearing them at 6 months with no problems."
3,CUTE but run small,LOVE these but the last time my daughter was able to wear them was at 3 1/2 months old and they were getting WAY too small then! How sad is that! NOT 0-12 more like 0-6. My daughters feed are a bit bigger than other babies her age but not that big!
3,Cute but they shed like crazy,"These socks are soft, adorable, and they fit my 6-month-old's feet perfectly with room to grow, but they leave her toes covered - and I mean COVERED - in black fuzz every time she wears them. It's really gross. For this price you'd think the quality would be better. I'm very disappointed."
3,Pretty but...,"I love Trumpette products. Their sock designs are adorable but... they shrink after washing (in delicate cycle!). I got these for my baby girl who was 4 months at the time. They fit ok at first but she had to stop wearing them within a few weeks. Not fair!!! 0 - 12 months is deceiving. If you buy them when your baby is newborn or a month, then great. You may get more use out of them... I am a bit disappointed since she barely got to wear them. The green and yellow socks look practically new, except that they shrank... Now she's 7 months and I have to look for size 12-24 months size socks--designs are very limited in that size."
5,Adorable!,These Trumpette socks are too cute for words. I had seen other little girls wearing them and had to order it for my daughter. Nearly every time she wears them she gets compliments. They fit well and have nice bright colors. The grippers are a must have. I'm not sure how long these will fit. Got them when she turned 1 and there's not a lot of extra room - we'll see.
5,adorable great fitting baby socks,"I purchased these socks for the cuteness factor, but then bought several more because they actually stay on her feet! Check out the little lace up (converse looking) shoe-socks by Trumpette. They are ultimately my favorite. They are just too cute and they stay on the best!"
3,"Cute, but they run small..","The socks are very cute, overpriced, but cute.They are nicely made and a good quality. I bought the toddler 1-2 year size, and they are a little small. By that, I mean the black part that is the ""Mary Jane"", not the actual sock itself. My daughter wears a 6 Toddler, and the black barely covers the back of her foot. Something to definitely consider before you buy."
4,Great combination,"Mark and Robben Ford combine well on this album. There are outstanding tracks and some ordinary. Without Robben on guitar, the album would not have the same impact. The harp from Mark is outstanding but Robben's guitar is the best feature. Mark's voice is so similar to Robben that I had to keep reading the album notes to really believe it was not Robben. Occasionally ventures into Jazz which I personally find abrasive to my blues tastes. The best harp tracks are the Willie Dixon's 'Mellow Down Easy', 'Up and Out' and 'Up from the streets'. Listen to 'Heart Breakin Blues' for some great Robben guitar and 'On the Road again' for great rocking blues harp and guitar."
4,cute,"This hat is more for larger headed babies. However, my daughter will be able to wear this for a few summers. It is very cute."
3,The Battle of Midway,"Compared to the movie itself(Midway, Collector's Edition), this DVD is insignificant and does not say much. A few people who appear to have participated in the battle narrate their own feelings, which doesn't amount to much."
2,Cheap looking,This arrived and looked kinda cheap. The color wasn't the coppery color I had hoped for. I returned the item.
2,dimensions listed are not accurate,I'm sure this is a great toaster however I needed one that had outside dimensions less than 15 inches which at the time when I bought it was listed as such. Turns out that is an inside dimension. I sent it back
4,connect direct to electrical control panel,"I connect this back plate in a APC SU3000. Is the perfect option to connect the UPS direct to Electrical control panel and from de elect control panel leave cables protect by UPS.Easy replace, just disconnect and remove the old plate and replace by the new SU027 back plate"
3,Not same product,"I ordered the fondue set as a gift for my brother, when it arrived it was not adaptable for stove-top (as was described). It arrived in good condition and was at a good price, just was not the item I thought I was ordering."
2,silly,the quality of this product is so low.. i would be embarrased to serve people food from it. it would seem to be worth less than five bucks.
1,Unhappy buyer,"The fondue pot does look very nice! But it's missing some parts (the fuel burner/container, the protective cover, and the fork guides). The box doesn't have any assembly directions--just some recipes written in French. The only ""document"" written in English is a warning, in red letters, not to use liquid or fondue-pot fuel.Overall, this fondu look like used, reconditioned, or refurbished."
3,Make sure you have everything before making a fondue night,"I bought this thinking that everything came with it. Well, almost - didn't get the gel-pack thingie for the burner. Just make sure that you read the description CAREFULLY and get EXACTLY what it is that you will need for your fondue night."
1,horrible,"It came with parts missing, the pot was dented up, and I tried to ignore the dent and use it anyway but everything just burned in it......"
1,Awful,"If you want to read a book full of cliches that panders to white left wingers than read this book. If you want to learn more about the Asian american viewpoint, regardless of your political stance, then read something else."
1,Its All Been Said Before,"This was a disappointing book. Besides being long-winded and self-indulgent, if not downright egotistical,the book repeats that which has long been at the core of Asian American Studies scholarship. However, the book oversimplifies and overgeneralizes in ways that reputable scholarship never would. One thing is clear from the book -- Professor Wu really thinks highly of Professor Wu."
1,This is a copyright rip-off!!,"I am not sure who this woman author is or the publishing house that printed this . . . but this is my idea! I wrote the original ""500 Ways To Say Said"" and it is still for sale on our Website--getyourwordsworth.com. It is copyrighted and this is a copyright infringement. My original pamphlet lists alphabetically more than 500 ways to say said and retails for $3.00! It is used by authors, students, teachers, fellow editors, proofreaders, and people around the world and was published and copyrighted before this edition in 1985. And, the second printing is also copyrighted--in 2001. It is a sad world when someone takes another author/editor's ideas and simply reformats it and then publishes it. Shame on this author!"
4,A great book for beginner investors,"I think this book is a wonderful tool for people who are interested in investing their money but don't understand their options, especially 20-somethings. It explains the different type of investments out there along with pros and cons of each. This book makes investing less intimidating and even provides resources to help you get started. This book was like a pep talk for me - it provided instructions, clear explanations and encouragment. Towards the end of the book you get the feeling that this is just a marketing tool to drive you towards Ameritrade/Amerivest products. That said, by no means should this be the only book you read, but it's a great starting point."
3,Too Many Football Analogies,"Moglia's approach to the topic is very well thought out. He covers all the angles of investing in the markets. However, the football analogies are overdone and unnecessary. His credentials and his exposition should be based on what he has done in the business world, not on what he did on a football field."
1,disappointment,I have read a little of the book and find Mr. Moglia writes well but the truth is that Ameritrade's business practices leave a lot to be desired given my experience with them.Ameritrade holds little value in the individual customer.Coaching football and being a CEO are not the same. You can be mean to your players but you need to treat your investors with respect.
2,Quality report,I like Willie Nelson's DVDs and enjoyed his book The Tao of Willie: A Guide to the Happiness in Your Heart.But the recording/reproduction quality of this DVD was disappointing.
1,poor book,"If you like reading size 5 font in light green against a white background or tons of other crazy unreadable combinations like light orange font against a yellow background, this book is for you. There is nothing in this book but a headache waiting to happen. The author clearly does not want you read this book. the Author is more concerned with thinking of ways to make the book as illegible as possible. Maybe she will write another book thus allowing you to actually read it......."
1,on the cheapish side of the street,"thin, too much cloth for my liking and way too little adhesive capability. i think it is ineffective for what one wants duct tape to do,"
4,Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution,"Very interesting book. If you've read From Hell, and you want to know a bit more about where Moore got his ideas, this is the book to read. There are a few leaps, I think, as far as Knight's conclusions, but for the most part, he does a very good job of investigation. It's the only non-fiction book I've read on the Ripper murders, and I can't say I know anything of developments since From Hell was written, but it has peaked my interest and I plan on continuing to learn about the subject. The most amazing part of this book is the final chapter, which, while it answered the biggest question on my mind while reading the book, I still didn't really see it coming. It's a major detail that Moore left out of From Hell, though I'm not sure why. A very good read."
4,connecting the dots,"I was impressed by Knight's making connections that I hadn't seen in other books on the Ripper. Fascinating how he makes a case for the victims being known to one another, insights into royal misbehavior, the societal forces brought to bear on the case, and the implication of the Freemasons. He makes a convincing case for a cover-up and for the involvement of high-level government officials as well as the artist Sickert whose paintings show an obsession and overfamiliarity with the Ripper's work. Good read whether you agree with all its conclusions or not."
1,Caveat emptor,"It's a theory that's certainly fun to think about, with royals and mad doctors and famous artists cluttering the landscape, and the fascinating question ""What did Victoria know and when did she know it?"" But Knight's book, while it does contain some genuine good research, has been thoroughly debunked by a number of genuine scholars. There's more creativity than logic in there, based in part on wishful thinking and in part on willful and selective disregard of the facts. I'm not being a wet blanket, here--it's a fun fantasy but it is NOT the solution."
2,"Anything But ""Final""","This book is quite readable, but its theories have long since been de-bunked. If nothing else, those with power in Victorian Britain were powerful enough to kill or hide anyone -- let alone a handful of unknown prostitutes. Why would they resort to the disruptive and sensational methods used in the Whitechapel killings? It all sounds so deliciously sensational and scandalous that one can almost want it to be true, but applying a little common sense makes the whole thing sound as ludicrous as it really is. While it is entirely possible that some kind of conspiracy took place to protect Jack the Ripper's real identity, this book's specualtions just do not hold up."
5,It's all a plot.,"Yes, it's true! The genius of Stephen Knight has uncovered the dark conspiracy that drew to their deaths five tanked-up tarts. Walter Sickert is now known to have been behind it all, assisted by Edgar Degas, whose misogyny is well known, and whose paintings of people striding along are obvious references to ripper-victim 'Long' Liz Stride. And if you believe that..."
1,"There's a good reason it's ""too weird to be true""...","It isn't. Knight's ""theory"" is a complete mishmash, and his alleged ""research"" evidently didn't extend to the royal calendar (which shows that the Duke of Clarence was nowhere near London when the murders were committed - for instance, during the double event killing, he was hunting grouse in Scotland along with several dozen other people!), Masonic records (there *are* no ""Jewes"" in Freemasonry), or workhouse records (see Donald Rumbelow's ""Complete Jack the Ripper"" for the true history of the Crooks family).A tasteless, witless hoax that has produced a ridiculous Sherlock Holmes movie and has forever tarred the posthumous reputations of Sir William Gull, the Duke of Clarence, Walter Sickert, John Netley (who may not have even existed!), Queen Victoria, Annie Crooks, and what seems like about half the population of London. Its sole value is as something to laugh at (and drop) in the bathtub."
1,Don't Bother - Waste of your time and money!,"This is not only a silly theory, but it is downright boring"
2,It fills a space on my bookshelf.,"I own Knight's book for the simple reason that I like to read anything that is published on the Whitechapel Murders. I have a bookcase for all my Ripper books and Knight is there. Besides filling the space between J and L, it is a gripping read. However, it is totally fictional. Knight writes in a way that sounds like meticulous research, but it isn't. His theories have been proven completely false, but the damage is done. The conspiracy theory involving people in the highest levels of power and esoteric Masonic rituals is something that has taken hold in the general public. When I tell someone that I read information on the Jack the Ripper murders, I can count on the reply, ""Wasn't that something to do with the Royal Family?"". Knight is well-known for his anti-Masonic writings, and that, for me, discounts everything he writes about Freemasonry as well. Those who want to know about the ripper murders are advised to start elsewhere."
1,Be carefull!!!!,"First of all, you must have laplink cables in order to make this program work. Off course, they don't tell you that!!!...Finally, you will spend hours downloading the software, because laplink's connection is ver unstable."
2,wait for 3.0,"Help for this product is non-existant. Tech Support reps send you chasing after tech notes. Documentation is completely lacking. Looks like the documentation has not been updated since the last version. The timing on how long this will take is way off. When I first started transferring files, it said that it would take about 3.5 hours. The transfer actually finished just under 24 hours!"
1,Simply does not work!,Awful product-could not get it to work with either set of cables. Never made a connection despite trying everything they suggest in the manual. Tech support was worse-cryptic emails that were no help. Impossible to speak to anyone by phone. Never thought I would be pleased to throw out a product but this one is the exception. Stay away.
2,back order?,"Would you remove ""1 in stock"", not to further confuse customers? I've been waiting for this watch for 1 week, today just realized this won't be shipped till next year..and the customer service told me this is because the watch is in back order while it still shows ONE IN STOCK!"
4,Looking to be in the top percent in college and high school courses?,"A match made in heaven?For college or high school, adding this to your American Heritage Dictionary, 4th Edition, and using them diligently will improve your reading comprehension and writing performance immediately.Start aiming for your best reading comprehension and excellence in writing.These are well printed; easy to use, and necessary for you to be in the competitive top percent of your class."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this software so that I could create a slide show with music, and burn to a DVD. The software is not intuitive to use, the manual is useless and misleading, and there is no technical support or back-up on the Media Now web site. Some examples of frustration: you can add only one audio to each slide show and ask for repeats. But how many times do you want to hear one song over & over as you look at slides?The previewing screen is very small, and you don't know until you burn your final product and view the end result on your TV set how the slides will really look. Options for setting up the first cover slide require ""buttons"" with the software graphics that are unacceptable from an artistic point of view. Childish graphics. I could go on and on. Bottom line - don't waste your money. There must be some software out there that is better. When you find it, let me know."
1,Media Now,Not what the right up said. It converted all my mp3 files to a different format and will not allow me to burn an mp3 music disc like Nero does. It will only allow the burning of 80 mins of music and not the 700 mb like Nero does. I am going to buy Nero and trash Media Now.
1,Non functioning product,"I have a laptop with Windows Vista. This product does not function at all. I went to my ""Geek Squad"" here in town for help. The only solution was to uninstall the program and get something else. I hope for a refund."
3,Fraud or Mistake? You decide...,"I did not buy this from Amazon, but at Office Depo. I am using it and works fine for Audio and WMA CD's. However, the CD I received does not give an option for an MP3 Disc. Why? Interesting.....Both the manual and CD case state ""06CLW-01."" But the CD I received states ""05CLW-01."" So does this mean I received the earlier version of the software? I sent a tech request to Nova to find out. Three stars until I find out what is going on."
1,Never got the software I just got a empty box,"I just got am empty bpx in the mail. I e-mailed the seller 3 times of course with no response. I would like to know what is AMAZON going to do about this , or should it be known on Oprah!!!!"
3,"Neat little alarm clock for kids, kids at heart and music lovers","Got this for my wife to replace an old Disney alarm clock that played various disney tunes.Made of plastic but seems relatively durable, VERY LOUD! In fact, I put a piece of packing tape over the speaker to mute the volume some.Only plays 1 tune, sounds kind of like a weird Japanese kids TV show theme. I had thought it played more (it said it had like 12 different tones-they mean notes, not tunes). But the wife loved it.But works well, and looks nice-I bet a musical kid would enjoy this."
4,good footage,"good footage, but it has been a year, since I watched it and I don't remember any of it. I passed my copy onto a friend."
1,total waste of your money,"Whoa, I should have passed on this one. Really boring. Basically just some amateur video of 1967 on Haight street, spliced in with boring talking heads and even more boring old TV clips. I was living on Haight St, 1966-1967, and it would be so great if a real movie could be made about it. There has to be better film footage lying around somewhere. This was so disappointing, like throwing money out the window. Parts of this movie looked like dated ads for ""psychedelic"" clothing. Since I was actually there, I can say, this is a very inaccurate picture of how things were. But, basically, just boring, boring, boring."
4,Just what I needed.,Got these for strapping down a soft car top carrier. Seems like it will work just fine. Seems to be a high quality product. Good price.
4,Good so far....,Price was great....will see how long they last. Holds my kayak on the car well...but I have a feeling that may start wearing on the sides. Will try to report back if they give out...
3,Ok but not for extreme heavy use.,"I really like these straps for length and ease of use. But after less than a year from purchase, one of these straps got a slice half way through from friction where I had it threaded through a hole in the bed of the truck. The metal doesn't seem very sharp to me, but apparently it rubbed on that metal just enough and sliced it. It can be repaired and is still usable, and I'll put some duct tape or something on that part that rubs in the future."
3,measure first,Too short to connect daybed and trundle together. Must order another one. Great price and should work with no problems.
1,Lashing strap,I was a bit misled in the fact that it is from Master Lock.......there is NO lock. It is nothing more than a couple of straps that I could have bought much cheaper at the hardware store.
2,Items not long enough!,These 2 straps were advertised as being long enough to hold 2 twin beds together to create a king-size bed! They are not long enough even when joined to do a really effective job. No 'how-to' insructions came with the package.
4,masterlock strap,"This product is worth every last penny, due to it got the job done!.I traveld from n.j. to f.l and the strap never loosen up on me."
4,great,good product - recommendedvery handy -used it for physical therapy for arm and then to tie two twin beds together into a king - handy item and well priced
5,Good product,"Good quality product and cheaper than local retailers. Got shipped quickly. Used it a lot to secure different cargos without any issues. Easy to lock and release. I end-up ordering second pack to keep in my car toolbox. Once find it a bit short, but overall can't take a star out - helped me a lot so holds 5 stars"
4,I wish these were a little longer,"I used this to keep the mattress on our futon when it is folded up. Does the trick! I just wish these were a little longer, so please note length."
3,Quality product,"Good quality product, but I didn't need it in the way I expected,so I returned it. I would recommend it."
5,Works great,Got these as extra support for a cargo bag & these worked great had no issues at all with them!
2,too short!!,the straps are good quality BUT the two straps do NOT fit entirely around two twin beds- we tried putting them on as directed but together they were about 3 ft short. We had to go to Lowe's and get an additional strap. My recommendation- go to Lowe's and buy the same kit BUT you will have to buy 2 pair (4 straps) there also. We still can't figure out why they don't sell single straps! 2 are too short 3 are way too long and 4 is ridiculous- you will have an extra strap for future use for something else......
1,Reviewers lie,"These straps will not fit around 2 twins or a split king. A standard king is 76 in x 80""' , a twin is 38x 75. If you add that all up it comes to 25 to 26 ft. Since the straps only equal 24 ft it can not possiblely work Unfortunate I just trusted the ad. Also there is a metal tab that will stick a half an inch beyond the buckle and either put and hole in your sheets or wall. Don't buy these for joining mattress."
1,Too short,This strap was suggested to purchase with the twin bed joiner I was also purchasing to create a king sized bed. These straps are too small to fit around two twin mattresses.
5,Smart buy!,"Very please with Master Lock 3060DAT 12-Foot-by-1-Inch Lashing Strap, 2-Pack! I used them with the Rola 59102 Expandable Hitch Tray Cargo Bag instead of the ones it came with. Just used the two of these to tie down to the Valley 90590 Deluxe Hitch Mount Cargo Basket. Sturdy and strong! Worth it!"
5,These straps are great.,The cargo bag did not move a single inch being secured with these straps. I traveled 1500 miles with the cargo bag on the roof of my car.I would recommend them.
5,Sturdy and Efficient Straps,"I've used these straps to provide me additional stability and security for mySportRack A90275 Aero XL Roof Box. Even though that is a very capacious and sturdy roof box, it only has one point of locking, which makes it susceptible to being slightly ajar sidewise when filled up to the max. I strapped it down with both of these straps, and the whole arrangement held up beautifully for the duration of our cross-country trip. The straps are indeed very sturdy, firm at the buckles, and lightweight so that they are easy to store and carry around. In the future I might use them for other strapping projects, but for the time being it's good to know that they can handle the more demanding tasks without a hitch."
1,These straps are terrible,I used these straps or tried to use them to help secure a kayak on top of my car. They failed terribly as soon as they got wet the clasp slips. Luckily I didn't really need them they were just an extra precaution.
1,Flimsy...a waste,"This Chinese crap started fraying under very light load on the first use. Very inexpensive, but not worth the effort it took to unpack it. If you want a good strap go to DRDcorp.com and get some good USA made straps. AND NO....I am not affiliated with this fine company. I have purchased their products and have been happy with them. I just got this Master Lock junk because Amazon suggested it as part of a package deal with another purchase. Don't trust anything you care about with this terrible Master Lock product."
2,Lashing Strap,"Make sure you buy two because believe it or not, one did not wrap all the away around my two twin beds! I was very upset but I didnt go crazy because I bought two so I can tie them together just IN CASE this would have happened. I still cant believe one didnt make it all the way around when this is what it is made for!"
1,Came Broken,Unfortunately we had to send this item back as the tray didn't snap in and the seat didn't adjust to all three levels (only 2) as promised. On a good note - Amazon was fantastic about handling the return and getting a shipping refund back to us right away.
3,How odd...,"I was researching this guy on the internet and found out the prototypical anti-semite was, in fact, the son of the famous jewish actor Heinrich Marr. Perhaps this explains why he always married jewish women. Will add more after I read this one.Edit: After further research, it appears I was mistaken about that. Too bad as I enjoy the irony like that - such as when Republican 'family values' politicians get arrested for sexual peccadilloes."
4,gift,"This was a gift and the recipient is very excited about the product. The box came packaged inside an outer box which protected it nicely, and it came in reasonable time frame."
5,Aero garden 2010,"I purchased two of these onAmazon and now I can grow tomatoeslettuce, green beans and much moreThank you Aero garden. It takes somework to learn how to use the systemand Aero has a great help linefor questions to be answered..With the tomatoes and green beansI ordered the extension arm andand extra cord to get the gardenand plants more room to grow..Greatidea so I can not have to buy outof the grocery store.My lettucealways does great."
5,Perfect for the whole family,"The aero garden is perfect for the whole family. We live in the city and plan on moving to a rual area soon. This is perfect to teach my boys how plants grow and what is needed for them to survive. They are really interested in using our herb garden in creating raw dishes and salads! Perfect start to teaching them proper choices for the body. I absolutely love it too, especially through the winter months."
2,Doesn't live up to ads,I am in week 5 of my AeroGarden and almost all the plants are dead from the bulbs being too bright. The mint barely even sprouted before dying. I followed all of the directions and fed and watered when it told me to and everything is dying. The most anything grew was about 3 inches tall. I have a coworker that bought one and it worked for her so maybe mine just has defective bulbs or something.
5,Great Graduation Gift,This was an excellent gift for my 2006 graduates! They were perfectly priced and each of them have the same pair and will remember receiving them for their graduation. This would be a welcomed addition to any young ladies jewelry chest.
1,Flower Power,Not worth wasting your money for. Her accent is so thick sometimes you have no idea what the heck she is saying. Just a waste of time and money.
4,A great phone at a not-so-great value.,"Having spent some time in-store playing with this device, and doing a fair amount of web research, I cannot say that I am an expert on this phone, however I can tell you that it is a handy little device.That being said, for a great deal less, you can get the w810i, which is thicker, and not made of the sexy metal frame, but includes a built in flash/flashlight, and EVERY other function that this phone contains. Unless you have the cash to drop, and want a phone thats just a wee bit sexier, I would suggest the w810i instead."
5,Very good out of the box,"I mounted it on a Remington 700 ADL 26"" Heavy barrel. I was bore sighting scope and was very suprised, almost dead on without much adjusting. At 100yds. set on 25 power, clear and bright. I think the varmints are going to be very unhappy. I could have paid much more, but would not have a better scope."
5,I really Like this scope,"Put this on my Ruger 10/22 and am very happy. It does every thing I wanted, a little overkill for this gun but I wanted that for practice at long range shooting, 75-100 yards... shipping was fast and description was on the money."
3,bonnie,they are ok for the boxes turtles and if they were mixed with can of box turtles food and veggies they are fine.
3,Nice cd book.,"At first I thought this was a video until after I got it.I was a bit dismayed but I should have read more of the description so I take a bit of responsibility on that for my part.Overall, it's a good listen & not bad. The only thing is that the narrator usually sounds like he's eclipsing into an orgasm when he says the name ""Sidd-hartha"". Part of me want to tell the poor guy ""Dude, it's just the man' name, not a vibrator. There's no need to peak at his name. He was a great man. We know. Relax & meditate for a few hrs to calm down.""Overall it is a good story & a true one at that.More books should be made into discs & this is a good start for my disc-library."
3,Probably funnier for u-ppers,"Not a bad movie, but it helps if you know the whole u-pper deer camp thing.."
4,Escanaba in da Moonlight by someone who has been there,"If you enjoy quirky humor you may enjoy Escanaba in da Moonlight. To enjoy some of the elements it helps to be from the North Central United States. If you are a vegetarian, PETA member or animal rights prude stay away.Based on a play of the same name written by Jeff Daniels the story follows a father Albert, his two sons Reuben and Remnar, their friend Jimmer Negamanee from Menominee and park ranger Tom through an adventure at the World Famous Soady deer camp.With alien abduction, supernatural intervention and dysfunctional family themes woven throughout the whole story this film mixes the real with the absurd. It is up to the audience to decide which is which. Fun for all who are willing to let go and laugh."
5,Annual Hunting Movie,"My husband and his three brothers are avid hunters. They discovered this movie years ago. When I found it on Amazon, I ordered one for the Deer Camp, and one for home. The men watch it every year. It is strange, but I think much of the humor is geared towards men,they love it !!!"
5,Escanaba: More a Guy Movie,"This is a non-conventional movie version of a theatrical script. The casting is great given the storyline. It is about Soady Deer Camp and a Soady (Jeff Daniels) who is about to turn 43 yrs old and is a Buck Virgin. The movie depicts real events and Upper Peninsula accents alongwith a closely knit family and friend who are enjoying their time at a Deer Camp. Highly recommended, may appear to be a slow movie overall but funny nonetheless in its own way. Eh!"
3,Stupidest Funny Movie I Ever Bought as a Gift,"I bought this as a gift when asked for by title. Glad I didn't buy one for me! It's that stupid Michigan ""U-per"" humor that you just have to understand to get. If you are a ""U-per"" or know what one if, you'll probably get this movie's humor. I bought it for someone else and she loved it?!? If you are asked to buy it and you do, you might be a hero, or a fool. Either way, if they ask for it by name, it's not your fault."
5,Escanaba in da Moonlight,A great film on the mystique of deer hunting in Michigan. It is a great trip into the unique world of the tradition of once-a-year deer camps every November.
4,Great,This was great. My friend wanted this movie and I could not find it anywhere. I found it here for a good price and have had no problems with it.
3,Silly,This movie was a gift and the person LOVES it! He is still trying to get everybody to watch it. Too funny.
5,Not just for hunters!,"My 10-year-old son thinks this should have won an academy award two years ago when he first saw in on the big screen. We purchased the DVD last night, and he has watched it 3 times since. I am not a hunter, nor a hunter's wife, but certainly know at least one fanatic hunter, as everyone does. You will need to watch this movie just to get a better insight as to what the attraction is to the holiday that hunters celebrate as ""opening season"". Thank you Jeff Daniels for bringing such a great movie to the screen that my whole family can watch."
5,A Yooper Review,I Love dis movie ehh. Livinf in Da U P is a unique expierence but being a true Yooper is a gift. Anyway very funny.
4,Super Yuppers,"I've spent time in the U.P. and have friends from there. I found the movie had its own charms - with the added bonus of some crazy ""aliens"" business. It was obviously a stage play and had that certain stage to screen ""feel"" about it - not necessarily a bad thing.Escanaba has a lot of heart and just enough weirdness to make it work. Daniels and his cast obviously believe in the material (he'd better - he wrote it) and that pays off in a very watchable, film. Taking place in a single day and night (the day before opening day of hunting season) this little movie takes off with a bang and rips through male bonding, family secrets, ancient ritual, metaphysics, philosophy, sibling rivalry, UFOs, aliens, God and farting.A heckuva lot of fun for a little movie with wonderful performances from the entire cast."
5,spectacular movie I have watched it so many times I wore out the DVD,"Reminds me of my own Deer camp in upper michigan. It is like ""the Yupers"" in movie form. Very creative use of fart humer."
4,Would like to see a Escanabe Two..,"I really enjoyed this movie. I even enjoyed Jeff Daniels ""Possesion"" scene, however, the choice of background music was probably a mistake. It was definately out of place. When I watch it now I fast forward through that part because the music is distractive. The passing gas scene was extremely funny, however, the buck shot behind the ""Two-Holler"" was absolutely hilarious! I almost broke the rewind button on that one. His (Jeff's) native american wife is very attractive. If that's his real wife he's a lucky man. This movie has already made it to my hunt camp and I would like to see more like it. Escanabe Two maybe?"
1,"In a work, ""YUK""","I am from Michigan and also a ""troll"" being that I'm from the lower Penninsula. (Under the bridge) I couldn't make it through the first hour watching this mess. I like Jeff Danials and have met him, but this movie is not worth watching or buying. I rented it first, and glad to be able to send it back to ""Netflix"" It was not at all as expected knowing ""Yooper"" humor.I thought it would be like the ""Airplane"" type movies, but I was wrong. Oh well, maybe I'm wrong about Yoopers humor. Anyway, I gave it 1 star and no more. Save your money, eh? Ya Bet'cha."
4,Why so much?,"I love this movie! I thought it was great! The only problem is the price. Almost [$$$] for a VHS and less than [$$$]for a DVD? What is going on here? I understand that independent films are not so easy to fund but why is there such a huge difference between DVD and VHS? I hope everyone who really wants to own this realizes that they can take the money they save buying a DVD rather than a VHS, spend a couple more bucks, and buy a DVD player. They aren't that expensive anymore and the quality is better..."
2,Escanaba in da Moonlight,"As a lifetime resident of Michigan I had high hopes for this movie. I did enjoy the first half, but then the movie got too deep into mystical imagery. The acting was good, but the story went from earthy backwoods humor to mystical fantasy toward the end."
4,funniest low budget movie i have ever seen,this is a low budget movie but if you like stupid comedy this will probably be one of the funniest movies you will ever see
5,Good low-budget film!,"I like this movie, had it before...but lost it and had to get it again. Like Jeff Daniels, and the Jimmers is hilarious..."
2,Escanaba in da moonlight,Started out good but then got weird and hard to understand. You definitly have to speak northern to understand what these guys are saying the acciencts are hardcore. I got this thinking it was going to be a funny movie but to us it wasnt so funny as much as confusing.
4,Yeah hey pretty juvenile.,"But I wasn't expecting epic film-making. It is a laugh out loud little movie. If your from the UP, & you're offended, sorry. It is funny. It is a bit of an insider though. People from LA or New York probably won't get it. The further you get from the UP the less relevant it becomes. If you live in Minnesota, Wisconsin or Michigan you know someone like the Soadys."
4,I watch it every Nov. 15,"I used to think this movie made fun of people in the u.p., that is until I moved up here. Its an accurate portrayal of ""yoopers"",I think the bar dance could have been any of the bars in Munising. Anyhow, very funny movie"
5,Awesome,"I love this movie. It is just so strange and the more you watch it the stranger it becomes. It may be seen as dumb to some people but if you just want to sit back, not think too much and laugh a few times for an hour and a half then, well, it'll do for that."
2,Being drunk MIGHT help this movie... but maybe NOT!,"Started out pretty good and went down hill from there! Being drunk may have helped this movie to be more funny, but I think maybe not! This movie was recommended to me by a friend... but I'm thinking now that I need to check my friends a little more closely!?! Don't waste your money renting our especially buying this movie!"
1,The worst movie ever,"We decided to watch the movie on the opening day of Buck season in Michigan. Horrible! Bizarre. I want that hour and a half of my life back. I am from Northern Michigan originally and grew up around hunting, but literally did not laugh once."
1,This is NOT Escanaba by ANY moonlight,I live in Escanaba and remember when this was filmed and even was on location at times. This movie is a complete insult to Yoopers. The story line itself was completely ridiculous and could maybe have been a good story if not for the ridiculous alien scene.
1,shipping,paid for the fastest shipping and it took 10 days to arrive. why did I bother paying extra?
1,This Movie Is An Insult,"...to the intelligence of the viewer. As a former UP resident I was excited to check out this movie. Unfortunately it is nothing more than one long inside joke. Think of it as a very long Da Yoopers video, and we know how tiresome their schtick quickly becomes"
1,I feel exploited......,"I wanted to like this movie so bad. As someone who grew up in Wisconsin hunting and now lives in Houghton Michigan (in the UP), I really thought that this movie would appeal to me. I love the UP, and I love deer hunting. But this movie, well, it just went from making some lame caricatures of deer hunters and people of the UP in general, to being flat out bizarre and weird (and not in a funny way). I'm sorry, I understand how people want to like this movie, simply based on it's premise, but when a movie supposedly about deer hunting starts bringing in UFOs and hallucinations--it just makes things strange. Yet, the wackiness could be tolerable if the movie was actually funny; but sadly it is not. I feel like my love of deer hunting and the UP in general was exploited by this film. Save your time and money and don't bother with this trash."
2,started well,"As a person with 50 years of relation with the UP of Mich, I liked the first part, but in the later parts of the movie it became a bit to gross for me, and a bit unrealistic."
4,Great movie about wonderful people and places.,"This is one gut-bustin funny movie. I had lived up in the UP for some time and can say that there really are people like this up there. Not all of them or even the majority of them to be sure, but if you get into some of the real back-woods communities you will see them. I know that some youpers don't like the way that youpers are protrayed in the movie and am sorry for that. Many of the people in the UP have never ventured out of the towns that they grew up in to the point that they themselves don't know that people like these in the movie actually live up there."
3,Good 'ol 70's psych rock,Not a bad album overall. Frist half of the album is good then starts to roll off.Reminds me a bit of Steppenwolf with a bit heavier riffs. I think if you like Steppenwolf and Capain Beyond's first album you'll like these guys.
3,I wish the Zippers were better,"Nice bag if your not in a hurry, zipping and unzipping almost all compartments on this bag is diffacult because the bag is made from cheeper material."
2,silicone pan review,Doesn't work well for brownies. Might be better for cake. Can't get the product out of the pan very easily.
5,Religious Liberty and the American Experiment,"In this highly readable book, preeminent constitutional lawyer and First-Amendment scholar Seamus Hasson provides a worthy tour of Church-State relations at law in America.Mr. Hasson brings a wealth of real-life cases that read stranger than fiction, with such amusing examples as the parking-barrier worshippers, and, beyond the levity, brilliant analysis of one aspect of the culture wars.The book poses provocative questions and points to some principles that may avert our impalement on the horns of dilemma, largely by providing a rare coherent take on the so-called religion clauses of the First Amendment of the Constitution."
1,A terrific waste of time,"A mockumentory that is not funny or entertaining, or even modestly interesting. It meanders on what seems like interminably."
3,Ok but nothing special,It was an ok book but there were definite flaws in it. First off he does a bad job of describing some of the traps used in defeating the bat- that could just be me. Once the boy was left to face the bat alone it was pretty unrealistic that he could kill it when they couldn't when the whole group was there. Zindel is capable of much better but it is still worth the time.
2,One of the ribbons was bad,"After using one of the ribbons the printer kept popping up with an error message (ribbon jam) and I had to replace the ribbon with a new one to stop getting the error. When I buy the ribbons locally I can return them without having to pay postage and recieve a credit. So it may not be a good idea for me to purchase them online.Thank you,Jill Carlisle"
3,Bela,"Never looked better. These are old some are redone,hard to remember when you have over 1200, movies. Shipping first class as always is, once in awhile gets lost since I am in Thailand. Great stuff love Classics and here it is."
1,Big Yawn,"I totally agree with the 10/18/00 1-star review written by ""A reader from Midwest, USA"". I had completely lost interest in continuing with this book about halfway through. The author was inconsistent when referring to key players...sometimes calling them by nicknames, sometimes by given names...and they all had very similar names to begin with; so it was impossible to keep everyone straight without taking notes or constantly flipping back and forth to the photos. I also found it to be a waste of time that he went into so much detail about the backgrounds of people who played no part whatsoever in the case.The biggest disappointment was the author's failure to give us sufficient background information on the victim and her family."
1,Not impressed,"This book had to many characters, and some with nicknames which kept getting me confused. It didn't have enough background, only jumping almost immediatley into the murder and never looking back. It just couldn't hold my attention. All in all it is a very poor book."
2,"Too long, too mellodromatic","This book is too long and needs more editing. It also makes the victim look as though she was a saintly, resourcefull heroine. This si supposed to be a true crime book. The author spends too much time on the lifestyle and personal habits of the victim, and that is totaly irrelevant to this book. The author puts too much emphasis on how the victim's father copes with her death. While the author tries to paint a positive image of the victim, she's realy just a spoiled rich girl who liked hanging out (and sheltering) drug dealers, a pimp who prostitutes little boys, and other assorted low lives."
1,not a totally true acount,"the book is not totally true in writing the people names are false and the statements are false in some shape or form, i know there you might of change the names to protect some people but you didn't get the proper right or authorization from family, friend or eyewitness. so next time get your facts straight and interveiw everyone first in question.before writing a book.a friend of family who new most parties in the book"
3,KL,"The book was good, nothing great. I thought the author jumped around at times and bombarded the reader with too many names."
2,Subtle and Insightful jokes. Not as funny and interesting as Time Flies.,"This book has 2 parts. Part 1 is titled Love, part 2 is called Marriage. I find part 2 is more humorous than part 1. For example in part 2, page 108, he wrote ""A husband should go with the flow of his marriage, even when that flow leads over a cliff"".As usual his jokes are subtle and insightful.Overall, Time Flies is funnier and more interesting than this book."
5,We all can learn from the love life of Bill Cosby,"Bill Cosby, yet again, writes another amusing classic. Filled with amusing highlights (and lowlights) from his first dating experience until his 25 year marriage. There is enough wit in the book to make anyone who ever saw a married couple cry with laughter, yet enough wisdom to make the married, or soon to be married, think a little. As always, Cos delivers his comedic timing and insight on a barage of subjects to make everyone who reads this book laugh out loud and be glad they picked up the book"
3,Good book but needs updating,This is a good book for learning about Karting. It was published in 1999 and is somewhat outdated. No mention of the new TAG type motors or racing classes. If your new to karting and want to learn more the book would be helpful.
5,Fun for the smart,"That rare and wonderful thing---a book the whole family can read together, read to each other, and laugh for days. It's become my favorite gift for everyone."
5,"If you need a bellylaugh, this is the book for you.","I had bought this book for my husband for Christmas, but when I was undergoing chemo and really needed a pick-me-up, this book did the trick. Our entire family - kids and adults - just laughed and laughed with all the wonderful gems in the book. A great gift for someone who needs a good laugh for their well-being."
3,1001 Dumbest Things Ever Said,"Not a typically written book, but a fun quick read. Most of the things said have been heard before, but if you need a light, non-thinking beach read this is the book for you. I wouldn't pay a lot to download it, not worth the money."
4,Probably funnier if you are American,"There are some brilliantly funny quotes, but plenty of them require knowledge of local culture and baseball. If you don't know - they aren't funny."
4,It's Good,It's a funny book. I really enjoyed the stupid answers given to the college exam questions. I even read parts out loud to my husband.
3,"Nice pictures, but is that enough?","The pictures are excellent, but they are not plentiful, particularly in the case of the '69 and '70 Chevelles. Of course, much attention is paid to Yenko and Baldwin-Motion, as in other similar publications. The text (also in short supply) is well-written. Overall, should be titled ""Chevelle-Light""."
3,Chevelle owners will want this book,"Okay the book isn't perfect but if you own one of these great cars you know there's just never enough books on the topic. Buy the factory service manuals first, then add this one. Oh, and please drive your Chevelle, that's what they're for!"
3,You'd have to live there,"You know, I bought about a dozen copies and sent them as holiday gifts to my buddies from FR... but if you had not grown up on the peninsula, the story wouldn't mean that much...The author has an excellent memory and accurate perspective of life in Rockaway's, but a weak story line.If you spent anytime between Bayswater and Belle Harbor, you'll get a bunch of smiles from this book -"
4,Accurate feel for the '80s Rockaway era...,"Good book. Takes place in a time of innocence, before plane crashes in Belle Harbor and NYC. Being From Rockaway myself, I'm a bit biased. Having grown up on 117th and the boardwalk (where much of the book takes place), I can picture the locales, as well as relate to select characters. As a teenager, I too spent my summer days surfing and nights drinking on the beach. A keg and a bonfire... we used the lifeguard chairs for firewood, would run from the police. Fun fun fun. Book being true to life, there really was nothing else to do in Rockaway. My old building overlooked the lifeguard ""shack"" on 117th, so I got a first-hand view of what went on. They are a different breed for sure.""From Rockaway"" accrately captures the flavor of '80s Rockaway Beach, NY-- through the eyes of local teens bored out of their skulls, looking for excitement. I'd recommend it to anyone who grew up in Rockaway and can remember Playland-- before it became a housing development."
2,Juvenile and insidious account of childhood friends,"Jill's recount of her days as a lifeguard on Rockaway bch was both depressing and flat. (especially considering the stories potential) She worked and was friends with fellow rockawaites, but was so convinced she was better than everyone else that rather than see the individuality and intrigue of each of her characters, she wrote page after page about how culturally and mentally linear each was. She introducted wacky characters who could have been fun and the reader, if they wanted, could have deduced were drunks. However, by Jill telling us that there was nothing we could possibly gain from these close-minded, local ""drunks"", the reader is forced to ask, ""why bother reading about them?"""
2,Locals Only,"As someone who personally knows all the characters in the book, I was disappointed that Jill missed such a wonderful opportunity to explore the quirkiness of the people and the neighborhood. These characters have depth not explored by the author. There are many rich and funny stories to be told, perhaps by someone who was a little closer to the action and could tell the story with a level of identification not evidenced in the book."
4,"I dig it, Michael.","The songs on this CD are interesting because they're simple and raw. There is only piano, some kind of primitive organ, and singing. I like the songs, despite the impression that they were written and cheaply recorded in a hurry. It sounds like a demo tape done on the fly in someone's kitchen with a cassette recorder. There are lots of tempo problems and sour notes here and there - much of it sounds improvised. But even so, it has a charm about it that makes it listenable and enjoyable. I repeat - there is nothing slick in this. It's an acquired taste for sure, but worth checking out if you're into weird stuff. I would have given it five stars simply for it's freaky originality, except that by the end, it gets a bit monotonous."
1,Ridiculous,"My friend and I used this to attempt to blonde her medium auburn hair. We figured this product should do it easily since it says it lighens up to BLACK hair.We followed the directions to the tee and waited.Well... After a full 90 minutes... She ended up with bleached roots and bright red/orange ends. Dyed completely unevenly and she was freaking out. We are dying it red now and hoping it covers the platinum roots.Absolutely ridiculous.""Nice 'n Easy"" is possibly the worst possible name for this product."
2,Be careful!,"Definitely bleaches your hair but didn't get all of the color out. May need a second treatment but I'm not going to try it. Light brown hair here and thought it would be a snap to get the summer blonde look with no problem Even after 90 min my hair came out with big-time reddish tints. Looked terrible. Not freaking out since I'm a guy and I can always cut my hair shorter or wear a ball cap.Ladies, think really long and hard before doing this. Spend the money and get it done right the first time.Happy for anyone who got a good result with this stuff but I'm going to need to dye it back to my natural color or darker to get the yellow/orange out."
3,"Great for dyed black hair, otherwise, meh.","I used this bleach twice with very different results. The first time I used it, I had dyed blue black hair. This is the only bleach that has ever gotten blue black out of my hair. It turned a sorta light orangey brown, but it was close to my natural color and was not black, so I was happy.The second time I used it, my hair was its natural color. I left it on for an hour and a half...and it turned bright banana yellow. So I applied it a second time for another hour, and it turned dull banana yellow.I'd like to know what bleach the model on the box used, because I'd buy that next.If your hair isn't dyed black and you want omg blonde like the box, go to Sally's and buy Kaledicolors or any of the quick blues, a toner, and an ash blonde. I'd skip this."
4,Born blond ultra blue,"After dying my hair dark, I used this product and it significantly lightnened. I hoped for a platinum blond, didn't quite get there, but it did not leave my hair orange. I would recomend this product if you want light blond hair without any brassy tones."
1,Worst experience of my life - and I've been through a divorce!,"I am hiding in my room. And this is after spending 5 1/2 hours and $300 at the salon today. They were not even able to repair the damage this product did to my hair. I followed the directions to the t! I am a competent, intelligent person. Do not purchase! If you purchased it, return it or throw it away, but for God's sake do not put it on your hair. It turned my hair brassy orange and platinum. I think I was actually glowing in the dark last night. I thought I could save some money by using this product, but trust me it has done nothing but waste money and cause heartache. The box says ""blonde without brassy tones"" what a JOKE!!!!!"
2,Yikes! Clown Hair,"Followed instructions; applied product; hope was high for the perfect color. After one hour it was clown red and seemed that the product had stopped working.It was a weekend. Clairol wasn't open so I waited two days wearing clown red hair to call and or email the help desk. They told me that had I left it on 90 minutes the red would have gone away.Let's just say my opinion is inconclusive at this point, but doubt I'll use it again."
2,Basic Advice,"Unless you're really clueless in the area of social skills, or maybe if you're just really young and haven't lived long enough to learn skills us older folk take for granted, this book would be a waste of your time. I'm amazed intelligent people like Matt Lauer actually have a need for a strategist. For the rest of us, its unlikely you're going to read much of anything that you dont already know."
1,Hackneyed advice,"First Lindner book I have read. How does a self-aggrandizing daddy's boy manage to get the puffy endorsements from celebs? Amazing, and this book should be an emabarassment to a smart guy like Matt Lauer, who is the star of the author's claim to fame. Boring, trite material which could be summarized if the whole book said only ""carpe diem."" Maybe he is smart -- he got my money and evidently from others who were taken in by ""reviews""."
3,Fun while it lasted...,"So I bought this pool for a party I was having to use as a ""hot tub"" here in NY when it was about 35 degrees out. I live on a horse farm, so we have a hot water spigot. That part went well. The next day, I went to drain the pool- NO DRAIN PLUG! Grr. So, I start using a 5-gallon bucket to pour water out- takes a while with 100+ gallons in there. Finally, I got it light enough that my friend and I could tip it, and the side blows out! We hadn't put much pressure on it, and yet it came apart. Not a very sturdy pool. Can't say I'm overly thrilled, but it was fun while it lasted :) Mark W."
1,I can't believe the ratings!,"I can't believe the ratings of this piece of... (I'm not even able to describe it without using bad language!)If you want to waste 85 minutes (that seems 10 hours) of your life go ahead and suffer.The director seems stoned all the time. You call that surrealism, man? Need to watch ""urgently"" the works of the masters of the genre, from Luis Buñuel to David Lynch or Cronenberg."
4,What do we do with all those shoes?,"This is a very unusual movie, full of quirky characters and surreal circumstances. I think this movie is more akin to the French movie ""Amelie"" than ""Like water for Choclate"" as one reviwer suggested. The movie is totaly refreshing and, for me, I like it even better on second viewing. I especially like the allegory of Lucinda hoarding up all the baby shoes in her suitcase. Sometimes we treasure some things so much that we forget what they really mean to us."
2,The Director Had to Have Been Baked...,A strange yet sweet love story of 2 simple folk.The landscapes and colors are beautiful and vibrant.The acting was OK.But there were twists in the story that only a stoner would come up with!
5,Rolling Away the Stone,"The book is in good condition and arrived in a timely manner. I have begun reading, but have not finished. At this point it is well written and researched."
2,Disturbing,"I found Silko's book too disturbing to keep on reading. I understand that the disturbing nature of the work is the point of the book, but it was too depressing (and,as another reviewer noted, gratuitously so), that, rather than become engrossed, I became turned off and disappointed. I respect Ms. Silko's reputation, and am generally interested in Native American issues, but the Almanac's approach was too depressing/despressed to evoke my empathy or even interest."
5,awesome read,"I've coached hoops for thirty years and am going to make my HS team read this book this summer. Hurley is old school, teaching the new school about class, effort, and loyalty. I wrote Coach Hurley about 10 years ago and he promptly wrote back, sending me a play I inquired about.The book is well written and has too many life lessons and soulful anecdotes to recognize in this space, less I write a book myself. If you coach, or have a child interested in striving for some lofty goal--regardless it be in sports--this book is a bible of wisdom and textured life journeys."
4,Well worth the read,As a high school football coach I could relate to many of the problems coach Hurley faced and believe all coaches can get something from yhis book.
4,Standing Your Ground,"Bob Hurley is a bully, but he's an honest bully. And he believes that without being a bully that his kids at St. Anthony's will be swallowed up by the streets of Jersey City. Hurley also has a gift. He knows what it takes to play winning basketball and he refuses to give an inch at anytime or on any level when it comes to imparting what he knows. The result is the greatest high school basketball program of the last quarter century. There are many hurdles at St. Anthony's high school, and funding is incredibly hard. But, what isn't raised in the book is that recruiting is rather easy. Hurley's reputation brings players far and wide to come to play for him with the knowledge that a scholarship is the reward."
5,Bob Hurley is a hero,There aren't too many people who turn down million dollar contracts to coach High School basketball for a couple thousand a year. Bob Hurley claims he was put on this earth to save these kids from the Ghetto and a lifetime of jail. After you read this you will understand why he does it and why he's the best at it. You will understand why St. Anthony's has the best basketball program in the country. Why is it that the prep schools get all the credit even though the kids only transfer there for just one year. Bob Hurley builds his program with kids from the ground up.
5,"Should be read by all Canadian Airlines Employees,","Amazing research built into a story of interesting pioneers transforming a bush pilot airline into a an airline that is now recognized World wide despite government interests in promoting the ""National Carrier's as the chosen one.An example of entrepreneurs and private enterprise struggling to survive.I feel all Canadian employees should read this to appreciate where the airline has come from and that it has survived far more difficult times than those it currently still faces. As a supporter of Canadian and past passenger of Canadian Pacific, Pacific Western and Ward Air I found it most interesting."
2,Big disappointment; couldn't even finish,"This is basically a road trip adventure story for Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner) and Green Arrow (Connor Hawke). They apparently retrace the steps of a previous Lantern/Arrow team up story. Plot was absurdly wrapped around a search for Kyle Rayner's father, who had left him as a child. The guys visit a fringe town and get into fights with the cops and uncover an evil plot to destroy the country while Kyle gets manipulated into launching a dangerous satellite. The whole thing is a mess, frankly, and it felt like DC was compelled to run a story that tried to help kids who'd never known their parents deal with some of those emotions. The only positive thing I have to say is that GL's conjured up creations looked pretty cool; otherwise you should save your money and skip this book."
3,great idea-not so good story,"what a great idea for a book,team up the new emerald heros.to bad the story writers didn't do more with it.i found that the story was long and drawn out.it was cool that they went places the original heros went and battled some of their old foes.i just didn't get hooked on the plot.the art work was good.as much as i wanted to get into this book it let me down.i was looking for some action but only got it in small(very small)doses,i would recomend buying this book just so you can compair the adventures of both the old and new."
1,mavais mauvais une horreur,"rarement vu un dvd musical aussi exécrable depuis les images aux coloris délavés sans relief, des prises de vue de mauvais amateur, sautantes et tournantes, donnant le tournis , un envahissement des paysages au détriment des vues de l'orchestre , une mise en scène de patronage, des ballets paysans ridicules , une absence d'ensemble aussi bien des ballets que musical renforcée par de fréquents passages non synchronisés: on est alors tenté de chercher le repos visuel et de fermer enfin les yeux, mais alors la lourdeur, le manque de finesse et de poésie de l'interprétation dont ce chef tcheque ne nous avait pas habitué, surtout dans un rle visuel grandiloquent insupportable .. enfin bref à eviter cette horreur et sinon, à jeter !!!"
5,Moving on is worth it!,"I have used this book personally and with small groups during divorce recovery. It is practical and helps to normalize the fear, anger, resentment and other feelings that arise out of the marital loss. It teaches us how to get on the right track to recovery and forgiveness. It really does give us tools and insights to move beyond divorce rather than remain feeling vicitmized. An easy read with a thoughtful, interactive plan to rebuild life."
3,"Good enough, but not great",Decent quality for the price and works well for strapping or holding down loads. Better quality (higher priced) cam buckles have a smoother pull on the one-way free direction for pulling the strap tight. With this product you need to push down the retainer cam slightly to pull.Not a major issue.
1,Improper design for a campbuckle,"These straps are decent as in they hold small stuff. I bought 10' long straps because the typical 6' isnt long enough. Only really wanted to hold 2 bikes in a fork mount rack that was just placed or any small things like groceries in boxes from sliding. They don't grip though. You have to tie a knot after tightening for a decent chance at it holding, not even close to 300lbs of advertised force."
5,Work great,"These are perfect for securing stuff in my truck. they are quick and easy to use. At least for short term (1-2 days they are perfect), not sure how they would last on a long highway trip (go with ratchet for that."
2,"Small, difficult to open","It's good quality, but for the money, I didn't anticipate how small it would be. For anyone with more than an inch or two of hair, or thick hair, it's not very useful. Also very tightly connected and difficult to open. The quality is high, so I'll probably buy a larger comb from the same company, but skip on this one."
4,Great Comb,"I've kept combs in my pocket for ages and they always get gunked up with fuzz and whatever happens to be in my pocket at the time. Now I can keep it in my pocket without worrying about fuzz and what not getting stuck in the bristles of the brush. It won't pop open in your pocket either, it takes a reasonable amount of force to get it to open. It also has a clip on the side, which is handy because who wants a comb to be in the same pocket as dirty change/money? Clip it on your belt or pocket and you're good to go. Kind of hard to remove from a belt or pocket though, which is both good and bad. Sure it wont get knocked off and lost, but it takes some effort to get it to come off and I worry that i may break it. That's about the only real downfall to this comb, from now on I'll stick with these rather than cheap-o dollar store combs. It has a nice, classy look to it as well instead of cheap plastic like most combs.."
4,does the job,"It gets the job done, but is a little stiff to open and close. It might loosen up with use and time though."
5,Small But Very Nice!,"i purchased this come because my hair is quite long and does get tangled when im out and about. this folding pocket come is a bit on the small side,but it does a nice job,it does not hurt my scalp. 5 stars for its sturdy construction 1 star for its small size. still i recommend it to anyone with long hair that can't be tamed by running your fingers through it and need a small but effective comb. could be a bit bigger?"
4,not your usual sunday serman,"Being a Christian is not a set of rules that you learned in sunday school or the ability to come off looking ""Churchy"" or acceptible to Sister Margaret in the 3rd pew. Most people in our Churches today wouldn't approve of Jesus because he eats and drinks with sinners. Living truely free the way God intended us to live should make sister Margaret uncomfortable and Stephen Brown in his book Scandalous Freedom helps to shake us loose from our preconceived notions of American evagelical christianity. I Enjoyed the book and beleive that others will find a new courage to live in God's grace by reading it."
1,Scandalous alright,"The beginning of the book goes in the right direction - towards freedom (Christians really aren't free), and I was smiling as I read it. Then my smile turned to concern, and a definite frown by the time I got to the end. He sets you free, then very deftly wraps the chains back around you - tighter than before - it becomes the same old fundamentalist rhetoric. Once a fundamentalist, always a fundamentalist. A very disappointing read. Book went in the trash - didn't have it in me to give it away."
3,"Reads like little ""Sermonettes""",Steve Brown makes excellent points but this book is like a series of sermonettes rather than a teaching. Worth reading though.
1,Not worth the price,"Bought this watch since I had a previous good experience with Wenger. Unfortunately this watch turned out to be far less than what I expected. The watch did not work when it was delivered. I missed the deadline to return it, and ended up shipping it to Wenger to be repaired under warranty. The watch looks and feels like a cheap time piece. The strap is made of very thin gauge metal and scrathes easily. I would not buy this watch again."
1,Same failure twice,"I ordered two and they both failed in the exact same way. The seconds hand got stuck and would not move forward. Thought is was the battery, had it changed and the watch repairman said it had cheap Chinese internals. Visually awesome, functionally disappointing."
4,watch -beware of buying from america,"The watch is fantastic and everything I could have asked for, however on making the purchase through amazon the invoice showed import tax as zero.When the watch eventually arrived the delivery company wouldn't release it until import tax was paid.This should have been made clear as it would have been as cost effective to buy locally."
4,Descriptive and interesting,"What is often missing in writings about Russia is a vision of the people as generous. In this book, an interest in outsiders and a willingness to share often meager resources characterize the people.There are plenty of stunning photographs and descriptions of the trials endured by the travelers. Bugs and mud come to mind. One gets a strong sense of the excitement and adventure that motivated the guys to take the trek.A child of eight or ten could handle this book, but for an adult of twenty-eight, it was still interesting."
1,this snack attack is going back,"I'm not sure if I purchased a defective one or not but I purchased this for my 3yr. olds birthday. She loves Scooby. Unfortunately, after pressing the left ear, just about all he says is 'yikes I'm having a snack attack' then he shakes all over. Fun for the first few minutes. Pressing the right ear to activate his motion sensor does nothing. I have waved my hands, and his pizza and burger near and all around and Scooby sits silently. He is supposed to acknowledge these two foods ('that's not pizza but I love burgers...'), but again, does nothing. The box claims he says 50 phrases, but I've only heard 5. Possibly he has a defective motion sensor? Not sure, but I plan to return it to the store and test another before deciding to exchange it or get a refund. It would be a cute toy if it did what it said."
5,Blind Date Guide to Dating,"A great gift. It provides some behind-the-scenes information about the show (did you know Therapist Joe is a real person?), but mainly recounts some of the stranger Blind Dates while posing as a guide to dating. Heaven help you if you take this as real guide to dating.It's written by one of the show's producers and--like the show itself--is funnier than anyone has a right to expect. If you like the show, you'll like the book."
2,Well,"For the cost I found little difference in the store brand, and so the extra cost and taste does not make this worth it."
1,amazon screw up on pic,"well I wanted the energy bushings in red with the metal outer shells as pictured, i got black with no metal shells which means I have to scrape or burn the rubber from the original factory shells to reuse them and guess in the end it is my fault for not reading and just going by the picture and the fact that the page said they fit my application"
3,Good supplement,"This book definately has its strengths but also unfortunately has it weaknesses. On the plus side it contains a lot of information in its moderate size (250 pocket sized pages). It has several useful and extensive lists such as irregular verbs etc., and a very helpful and decent sized glossary of grammatical terms which can be of particular benefit to the independent learner (especially native English speakers who may find grammar and grammatical terms somewhat confusing). On the minus side it can sometimes be a bit frustrating to find explanations a little terse or spartan (probably a consession toward fitting so much material into such a small book, as is the absence of exercises). All in all I'd say that this book is a well worthwile supplementary or occasional reference work, which may yeild interesting or enlightening discussions but cannot always be depended on."
1,Rip Off,"The price went from [...] IT'S JUST BAKING MIX! Buy the book of recipes and ingredients to make 20 times that for the price!!! I don't know what's worse, this, or the [...] easy bake oven!I just bought an easy bake oven at a store starting with a T for v The baking mixes were all under [...] !! These people are insane. I can't believe it says someone bought it too."
1,Cruelty To Animals,I was appalled at the methods suggested in this book for correcting problems. Tying the horse down in the barn or putting in into a stall and shooting the horse with BB's or stabbing it with a pitchfork til it bleeds to correct the problem of being barn sour were just two of the methods this author described. Save your money for a book on humane correction. There are plenty out there.
2,Was it not clear only to me?,"The mirror is pretty enough, but the frame appears to be plastic. Granted, it's a high quality plastic, but for the price I expected wood."
3,for the completist,"the comic insert is great, the video is pretty bad. If you really like GH's work its a must otherwise I'd skip it."
4,so big,Very good book. My one year old loves it and throws his arms in the air when I say Sooooooooo Big!
3,A bit too simplistic.,"My 14 mo. old daughter is not too interested. I don't think this lift-the-flap is challenging enough. It's cute enough, but I don't think the illustrations are very interesting to her. I guess it depends on your child's likes/dislikes. She's really enjoyed Dora the Explorer's Christmas Book-which has much more ""busy"" illustrations and oddles of flaps to lift."
3,Outdated for 2009,"I recently acquired a copy of this book only to find many of the retailers mentioned in this book to have closed down. Examples of them include Rose and Blacks.The one mall listed for High Point, NC is no longer opened to the public and is only for wholesale. A new smaller mall has opened in its place in Jamestown, NC.Many of the businesses showing Sunday hours are no longer opened on Sunday.All of this information was confirmed on the internet and is available from the High Point, NC Visitors Bureau."
2,Outdated,"Although I knew the copyright on the book was 2003, I bought the book and went shopping in NC in June 2007. A lot of the retailers are gone. I was looking forward to shopping at Rose and Utility Craft and both were closed for business. Blacks has moved. Furnitureland South has 1 million sq. feet of furniture and a good place to look, but prices were better at Blacks. Also be careful because a lot of the furniture is not from NC, but from Asia. This book was probably helpful years ago, but now is very outdated."
5,More than just a guide to the furniture places,"This is a great guide to shopping for furniture in North Carolina, no question about it. But the best part of the book is when Shapiro acts as guide for the other parts of your trip. Where to stay, especially if bringing your dog, covered. Where to eat in the various towns, covered, including how to order like a local. This book is tremendously helpful!"
1,utter drivel,"I just happened to come across this guy on EWTN as I was channel surfing. This is just drivel. The same couple of kindergarten-harmony chord progressions over and over again, dressed up with pointless arpeggios. This guy should be kept away from a piano at all costs."
1,Unmitigated trash,"I notice that three used copies of this CD are available from Amazon sellers, starting at $39.95.I wouldn't give you 39 cents for this disk, which is about the worst classical music you'll ever come across."
1,Save your money,"I have owned several shavers over the years. when my last one died, I bought both this and a small battery operated one by Remington. Unfortunately, this one didn't really shave anything. I tried the same scrub pants. first I ran this model over them, and nothing came out. Then the small battery operated one, which performed very well, cost about $7, and this cost many times more. I am attempting to return this one."
1,I agree with Mr. Strumboldt,"I feel that, while their intentions are good, many of the people in this book have views so extreme that they defy common sense. I found Peter Singer's views on human-animal relations disturbing and troubling to say the least. Also, while I agree that animals are treated terribly here and all over the world, these people have no scientific basis upon which to state their views. They seem to rely on the hearsay of others who share their views. While I was reading this, it seemed to me that the entire book had been written for the purposes of fund-raising. Overall, the people described in this book, all taken together, seem to have developed a very detailed philosophical approach to the cause of animal rights. It's too bad that they don't do a better job of implementing it. There were numerous factual errors I found in this book. Whoever edited it doesn't seem to have done a very thorough job of fact checking or proof reading."
5,You've got to try them. :),"I first had these when I was much younger, and was thouroughly suprised when I found them on Amazon. They are exactly the way I remember, well worth trying if you like the taste of ice cream, but not the calories!"
1,Background sounds are distracting!,"I have loved this movie since I was a child. And the opening sequence music has always given me chills. I was thrilled to see this soundtrack available and I ordered it immediately. However, this CD seems to be almost of bootleg quality. The packaging is cheap, with no real musical relevant notes (ie. list of musicians or instruments) and worst of all the music itself seems to be recorded directly off the movie. The other soundtrack sounds such as the ""Flying Beast"" sounds to characters walking is incredibly distracting. I expected more of a ""soundtrack"" of just the music. There are only a few tracks that are just music, but not enough to make it truly worth it. Even though the music is definitely important and interesting, in terms of it's composition and deployment it is very hard to tell because of the other sounds. You might aswell play the movie w/ your eyes closed."
2,BOOK 'EM DANNO!,"A great concept that could have made for great satire and comedy. But, alas it did not happen. However for director, it may be a good start to a successful artistic career.I especially liked the crime scene after the fire. It was done in a most realistic manner.Lastly, buy the movie (it's almost impossible to rent) and make up your own mind."
3,"Good, but flawed.","The movie's premise is brilliant. A cantankerous, vicious, temperemental Fidel Castro is on a boat in Cuba, which gets blown up in an attempted coup. He survives on a raft, drifts with the current and wakes up in Florida. Naturally, he loses his beard and takes on another name and keeps trying to return to Cuba. The actor playing the dictator is excellent whenever the dictator, who is used to everyone being a bootlicker and jumping at his every whim, is contradicted or frustrated in his demands. If the movie had simply stayed with this story, it would have been perfect, but the problem is that a couple of parallel stories (a boy being bullied at school, infidelity between couples and an incoherent side story of arm smuggling) detract from the story. Even so, the movie is worth buying. It will give you a good laugh."
2,Weak Script,This could have been a much better film had the writing not been so lame. The idea of a shipwrecked Castro living in Miami could provide endles opportunities for storylines but the writers blew it here. This film was probably under-budgeted hence the b grade quality of the film.
5,This movie was super!,I really enjoyed this movie. Maybe it's because I love Jaime Camil. He is a great actor. I think one of the best Mexico has to offer.
2,Too Political for me,I got this movie solely because Jaime Camil was in it but the movie was too political with too much blah blah blah on Fidel Castro - soooo! I didn't like this movie that much! How can I return this crap? LOL! I do love Miami though!
2,Fidel in Disguise?,"While not a dreadful movie, it leaves a lot to be desired. Ofelia Medina (as Doña Emelia) and Mexican child actor Adrian Alonso (as Tony) give the best performances. Spanish actor Juan Luis Galiardo does a respectable job in a role that portrays both the dictatorial and human sides of the demonized Fidel Castro, but his lack of a Cuban accent is a major flaw. The rest of the cast is lackluster. The story line is herky jerky and confusing at times. Overall the promising premise of this movie is undermined by a mediocre cast, script, and direction."
5,Collegiate Handbook of Composition by Woolley et al.,"The work covers classic composition themes; such as, grammar,sentence sense, coherence, emphasis, punctuation, mechanicsand spelling. The authors illustrate how to construct a simple sentence utilizing classic methods of construction. In addition,the concept of sentence unity is developed in detail. Sometimes,this process requires us to write several short sentences in order to achieve the logical unity and brevity. The concept ofoutlining is explained in organizing a composition. The processrequires arranging main ideas, ranking them and arrangingsubtopics. Many examples of these concepts are provided forease of application. The work is a good value for the price paid."
4,Across The Sea of Time,"Heard about this film years ago, but was never able to locate it at the time.Stumbled across it whilst loking for something else.[...]A young Russian boy, Thomas Minton, travels to New York as a passenger on a Russian freighter. Close to Ellis Island he gets off and thus starts his journey to America the same way as all immigrants in former times. Thomas is searching for the family of one of his ancestors, who had emigrated decades ago, but once sent a letter home together with a sample of his new profession: 3D-Photography. The boy follows his relative's traces by counter-checking the old 3D-Photographs of New York (using an antique viewer) with the same places and how they look today. This way, the audience gets to see the Big Apple in former times as well as today. Written by Julian Reischl [...]If you are outside of the USA Pal area, be advised that you would have to convert this to your regional format - or have a multi-format vhs player."
3,Disconnected,"I saw the movie today. It is OK in the regular format, did'nt see it in IMAX. I thought the soundtrack was the best thing I have heard in years. It was so mood setting I have those songs going through my head all the time. I don't know which was done first, the movie or the soundtrack, but the two don't seem to fit together as one. The moods of the two do'nt interact with one another. The movie is only 51 minutes long. The concept is cute, and i'm sure they saved a ton of money on payroll with no recognizable names in this one. But it was an interesting view of New York through the eyes of a young boy."
1,Product did not produce flowers...,Product did not produce flowers and it was a real disappointment. Planted in pots just to make sure they could be monitored and watered correctly and still got no blooms or flowers. Maybe next spring.
2,Not Impressed,"Although there is a lot of information packed into this book, I was very unimpressed with the layout and visual design. It looks like it was typed up in 1970. The graphics are ancient and the layout is just one big binder with no cross-referencing or indexing available. To find a useful game, you have to sift through hundreds of pages. It really is a shame, as there are some clever games here to loosen up an audience.Frankly for this price, I expected something a bit flashier and filled with reproducibles that I would want to copy and hand out. The way it looks now, and with it's unwieldy format, it's going to sit on my shelf.If I hadn't spilled water on it, I would have sent it back for a refund."
5,Five on Teasure Island,I enjoyed this book as a child and now this has brought great delight to my grand children. I still found it just exciting reading it to them
1,This DVD is defective.,"I bought three different, new DVDs and it does not have ""Make Peace or Die"" on it. It has a Marilyn Monroe documentary. Very strange.I pointed this out to Amazon and did not get any answer. Too bad because I would really like to see ""Make Peace or Die""."
5,American Dreams Good,"I have not listen to the whole CD ,but The part with Stacie Orrico on it is of the chain. Stacie Orrico debuted her Genuine CD IN 2000. It went gold ,but there was not too much attentin being put on her! But SHE just released her second CD. IT'a amazing. The first song is Stuck NAD IS ONE OF THE CATCHIest sons on IT! Next, Is more to life it has the Avril Lavine feel! Bounce Back HAS THE dESTINY'S cHILD FEEL. I Promise which was written by Diane Warren is a song that will stay in your head all day! Security starts off withthat Birtey Spears FEEL TO IT. bUT RINS IN THAT strong r&b to it. Instead will challege any one. In short you go listen to Stacie Orrico's new self-titled Cd and tell me what you think about! I give it 5 stars. Signing off Marvin Lee WilliamsP.S. The rest of this Cd is quite good. Go to mtv.com to go and Watch her music video ""Stuck"" THE FIRST SINGLE FOR M THIS CD!"
3,new sandals,I found out that these sandals run small so had to reorder 1/2 size larger. I have a narrow foot so new size is perfect. Dressy enough to wear with anything. Color is good. No problem returning.
2,Not comfortable,"The leather on this shoe is rather stiff - I haven't dared wear it yet as I know I will get blisters/grazes from the rubbing of the hard leather. But, it does look nice. I got these in a wide, but I feel that it really isn't wide at all - maybe not as narrow as a B, but not a normal C either. Length is correct though."
2,ok but not great,The stupidest thing about this monitor is the base has this stupid lip on it that prevents you from positioning the keyboard close in front of the monitor. I have this monitor at work and I wanna smack the guy that invented the base. The picture is OK but not great.
5,Great value - great monitor,"Very impressed with this product. This is my third View Sonic monitor and each one just gets better and better. Can't beat the price, either. Got here quickly and easy to set up."
4,Necessary books for legal studies,"PMBR is not required for law students, but it is highly recommneded for the study and practice of legal subject matter. These books are very expensive if new, so used books are fine, if there are not a lot of distracting pen markings."
1,DVD broke on second use.,I was able to watch the DVD once and the second time it cracked when being removed from the case. I have never had a DVD do this. It seemded like a good video but it must have been of poor quality because it is now in the trash.
4,The First Babyfood Cookbook,This book was a big help. I saved a lot of money making my baby's food instead of buying it and the recipes were easy to follow.
1,Printing quality,"The dictionary was purchased for two students in the US who speak Bengali. However, the printing quality was very poor. The letters written in their language were bolded this made the reading very difficult as one letter ran into the other. It was a paperback that would be easy to carry with their books and the price was great but it turned out to be a very poor purchase."
2,Ski Boarding Made Sad,"I am an advid water skier and took the time to watch this video. To my amazement this video doesn't teach beginers or even experts that much. I wouldnt advise this movie to people who want to learn or go all out. Sorry goes out to the maker of this video, but its sad truth."
5,Great Sound,"I purchased this crash cymbal for my son's drum set. It was a perfect fit with his other cymbals and like all other Sabian products has a really great sound. We have never been disappointed with Sabian. Also Amazon's shipping even, during the holidays, was fast."
4,Good Tie Down Strap,"I use this on the inside of my SUV or if I put something on the roof rack. This is a light-duty strap and should be used as such. It works well for securing lumber on the inside or something light on the roof. This is not a ratching clamp so you will not be able to get it super tight, but it works well for lighter items.The shorter length is also nice as it stores easily and does not leave you with endless material. Great for securing a stack of 2x4's together on the inside but I would not trust it to secure them alone on the roof."
3,Dymo Label Mgr 450,"I have used many label makers and purchased this one for it's 1"" tape size. When connected to a computer it is outstanding. The instructions, however, a pitiful and as a standalone labeler I wouldn't really recommend it. Not wanting to waste more time fussing with such a limited device, I was going to return it. Then I took a chance, loaded the software and tried it on my laptop. Surprise it works great. All the fonts and sizes in my computer are available making this very useful. Given this I would have considered a dedicated printer instead."
5,Feel good blues,"The Ford Blues Band have put out a feel good cd with Ford & Friends. Although not every track is blues in the strictest sense , the cd leaves the listener feeling warm and positive and knowing that there are some skilled musicians in the Ford Blues Band. Patrick Ford also demonstrates his songwriting skills with a number of tracks. A favorite of mine is Another Fine Day with Chris Cain doing vocals. The theme of the song is somewhat reminiscent of the Lovin' Spoonful's What a Day for a Daydream.This cd is worth a listen and I am glad to have it in my collection."
3,Trish P,"Purchased this Lamp for our livingroom. After putting it together we found the lamp didn't match the photo on Amazon.com. The decorative element between the stem & the light fixture was missing. We contacted Dynamic Lights & it was confirmed we had the incorrect base for the lamp. They apologized, thanked us for bringing it to their attention & sending a photo. They get a batch at a time, sometimes they use another base for the lamps, and they only have what the factory packages and ships. They offered if we liked the lamp & wanted to keep it, they would take a % off the lamp, or we could return it. We thought about returning it & ordering from The Home Depot, same price free shipping, but was informed Dynamics also supplies the same lamp to The Home Depot. We decided to keep the lamp & accept the % off in partial refund."
2,Batman Beyond Review,"Well, most of this book was pretty bad. The first two stories are pretty much exactly the same as the first two episodes of the show. The next few stories are not very good. They deal with stupid enemies that don't relate to the Batman Beyond universe. For instance, a mummy that comes to life or a magical demon from the netherworld. There are six stories and the last story involves a good enemy, Inque. However, the final story still isn't up to the Batman Beyond standard that you get from the show. Bottom line: If you really like Batman Beyond get the book, but don't expect the show. I suggest going to your local comic book store and getting a single issue to check out what the stories are like."
5,Very Entertaining.,"Since I am familiar with the author and the surrounding area he grew up in, since I grew up there as well, it was a blast back into a time and place, people and things I had forgotten about. I knew Bobby and his sister Jan - went to grammar school with them - played at their house from time to time - went to high school with his wife. I have read his columns from time to time in the local paper (when my sister would save them for me). I enjoyed reading and reliving some of his fond memories,and hearing names of long forgotten classmates. The stories of his children and his friends and grandchildren were touching and refreshing - I enjoyed his heartfelt story of his friend who passed and was touched by his sensitivity. Thanks for the memories as they say.....Keep on writing! (Bernadette Spedicato)"
1,Not Pleased and am done ordering anything from Amazon.,I did not receive it yet so I cannot give you a review. I am not pleased that I had to wait this long and it still hasn't been shipped. If it was unavailble I should have been told right away. It was a Christmas gift for someone and I will probably never get it. I think I'll stick to buying things at stores where I can see that they have. I ordered a book from Amazon last Christmas for a gift and the same thing happened. I never did receive it.
2,EPSON R200,"You get what you pay for! 200 means the amounts of Disks it will print before failure, the Plastic Disk shelve that you need to feed into the printer is not well designed. The flexible plastic wings bend and wear I'm at my wits end and am looking for another method to print my disks Stay away fro this poorly made product."
1,A piece of garbage,"This printer broke down after a month of use. The CD tray is awkward and was problematic as soon as I bought it. It will get you frustrated and its very slow. And with the 6 ink containers, it can cost you $75 just to refill. The software is poorly written and tells you that you can print 20 more pages when they really only mean 1. Honestly, after 2 months, I threw it out and bought another printer."
1,Epson = ripoff,"I have had this printer for a year or so and just recently the black ink cartridge ran out (colors were fine because I never use them, and refuse to pay the crazy amount for 5 different color cartridges). Anyway, long story short, even though my printer is set in Black Ink Only mode, it REFUSES to let me print anything whatsoever because one of the color cartridges is too low. What a ripoff. My Canon lets me print how I deem fit, in Black Ink only, even though the color cartridges aren't even installed in this printer."
2,Shuts down when any ink color is low!,"It should be noted that this printer will not work if any of the six ink cartridges runs out. I tried everything to get it to print, including cleaning all nozzles, and got nothing. I went to the basement and found my old HP 932C, which had sat unused for AN ENTIRE YEAR, and hooked it up to finish the job I was working on when the Epson threw its fit. The HP printed just fine, no problem. That should tell you everything you need to know."
1,I will never buy an EPSON product again,"I could not believe it when I read other reviews, that the printer will refuse to print Black & white if one of the 5 color cartridges runs out of ink. All of my other printers (HP, Samsung, Lexmark) will print B&W; even if the color ink runs out.And because there's 5 color inks, I frequently have 1 of them run out, and the printer will not use just the black ink cartridge to print B&W.;Because of this, I have vowed never to buy an EPSON product again, and will write similar review on Epinions and other websites. EPSON - you should be ashamed of yourselves for this terrible product. I have never felt this cheated in any electronic purchase I have ever made, and I almost never complain.Read the other 1 star reviews - This printer is GARBAGEP.S. The ink recharging/cleaning cycle that drains extra ink every time you turn the printer on is another SCAM. I have a 12 year old HP injet color printer that still works, and uses less ink."
2,not happy,I have had this for a year. I have had to reinstall the software several times. The last time I had to call customer service and spent time that I did not have on a problem as simple as the inability to reset the memory on the operating system.
1,Missed out on the class action lawsuit,"Burn me once shame on you, burn me twice shame on me. My first Epson printer clogged all the time. After a few years went by I made the foolish choice to give them another chance and bought the R220. The prints were fine but I found out the hard way that the printer disables itself when it determines one of the cartidges is low. So even if I wanted to just print B@W it won't do it. Unfortunately I found out about the class action lawsuit after the deadline and so can't even get the chintzy $40 ""coupon"". Now I'll just buy the cheapest compatible inks I can find, use it until it clogs beyond repair, throw it in the trash and never, ever buy another Epson product for ther est of my life."
3,"Inexpensive printer, problematic usage","I bought this unit exclusively to print on CD and DVD discs. Like the other users, I also have issues with the color quality, but even more problematic is the usage of the disc tray. I experience constant error messages that the ""CD/DVD tray is not set correctly."" There is really only one way to insert the tray, yet that tray must be inserted with a precision akin to putting a strand of hair thru the eye of a needle. The price is good, but the frustrations of having to try half a dozen times to get a disc to print is certainly not worth it. Not recommended."
1,"Broken product, poor follow-up","I ordered this and was provide a anticipated delivery date. After the anticipated date went by, I sent an inquiry email to find out when it was going to ship. I had to write three time over two weeks to secure a reply. I did redceive the product and it was packaged in a very poor way. Internal printer was damaged. Luckily I was able to retro fit with my old printer. ALso the printer heads were all clogged and needed to be cleaned. I was VERY DISSAPPOINTED"
1,You get What you Pay For,"I own one I got it for Free when I bought My Camera...Yeah. It may have good features, BUT it doesn't do anything very well. The photos aren't worth the money you spend on the paper you print it on.Yeah.Plus it is SOOOOOOOOOOO SLOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW...... even when just printing a black text on on like a word document.In Addition, *ALWAYS CHECK HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO BUY THE INK CARTRIDGES!*To refill all the colors PLUS just 1 black.For Prices on Refills go to...http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/BuyInkResults.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&sku;=C11C626011&ref;=BIDTo get your better performance, this is not it. To keep Prices low...Still not worth it (due to the High Ink Refill Price for such a tiny in Cartridge.)I shouldn't complain for gettting it for free...BUT I want to warn the people who will have to actually PAY for this.I really Hope This helps Everyone with their decision on purchasing a new Printer."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,"I have never written a product review before, but was motivated by this awful product. I understand the razor/razor blade model, but EPSON redefines extortion with their printer. First, if any color is out, the printer will not print, a set of genuine EPSON cartridges are 70 dollars and the printer will not let you use non-EPSON ink... please someone from the Justice Dept needs to read this and not let EPSON get away with extortion!!"
4,Good deal,"So far it has printed disc as I expected. As used ones go, it is in good shape. Shipped promptly."
1,junk junk junk,"after just less than a year this printer is calling for ink. replaced all ink w no help still has the red ink light on and will not print. call epson support. ""our next rep will answer your call in 49 min."" bull tried everything, reinstall sw.don't buy this or any other epson product"
5,Excellent Epson,This thing absolutely great! the color & resolution are outstanding! It is suprisingly quiet in operation and the CD printing is a real plus in a printer at such a low price.
4,Good book,"My cover is difrent. This is the first one in the series I read and I enjoyed it. Josehf Lloyd Murchison author of ""Tails of a Gay Incubus"" sold at Amazon.Tails of a Gay Incubus: The Memoirs of Divine Turin"
4,The Origins of Our Military Technology,"This program serves as an excellent introduction to WWII Germany's tech programs, the various efforts to obtain them and the controversy of using Nazis after the war. Being only an hour, you are only going to get so much depth here. Students of this subject may already be familiar with a lot of it, but there are new nuggets in here and its nice to have the visual info to go along with your studies. For more on these subjects, tryVon Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War,Dark Side of the Moon: Wernher von Braun, the Third Reich, and the Space Race,Reich of the Black Sun: Nazi Secret Weapons & the Cold War Allied Legend&Hitler's Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science and Technology."
5,Small Pelican LED flashlight,"What a great flashlight, for the car, camping, anything. It's bright, waterproof, put it in your pocket, or on the included landyard. If there's the possibility of a power outage, put it in your pocket and you are ready. Hint, to change the batteries, push the on/off switch to eject the guts of the flashlight and expose the battery compartment)."
2,Disposable Printer,"Purchased this printer, and it lasted just over a year.The print quality for photos, the reason I purchased it, was acceptable, but it burns through ink quicker than my old Epson, and the ink is outrageously expensive. It is almost as expensive to buy your next round of ink cartridges than it is to just buy a new printer. It also frequently loses connection to your PC, and needs to be reset, but this is just an annoyance.The printer finally died after the cartridge holders failed to reallign.If you buy it, realize that you are buying a disposable printer that will last you about a year."
2,LOTS OF FRUSTRATION:,"THIS PRINTER IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS XP. I have had to download the drivers and patches over and over again. It will work for a few days, and then Iget ""communication error messages"" and have to reboot for it to print. I switched my HP printer and no problem. It is dependable with Windows 2000. The cartridges are much more expensive than my other printers. Print quality and speed is very good for the price of the printer. The photo quality was okay"
4,Lexmark z45-pretty nice,"It works really well for the type of printer it is, and it only has a USB port. I was expecting a faster laser printer but got the wrong one, but this works well. I got mine from ...[the local store] and it includes the cd-rom, a color and a black print cartridge. I had a little trouble getting it to work at first, but it was probably just my computer."
1,GARBAGE PRINTER NEGATIVE 5 STARS,"The first one I had took less than a week to stop printing the colored areas. The replacement lasted about 5 months then did the same thing, of course I had just bought new cartridges. Customer support was inept at best, probably hit a key and send standardized message. After a few back and forths they tell me that it must be a bad cartridge. Give me a break, the color stopped in the middle of a print job. They did tell me how to print a diagnostic page. According to that there was a heater problem. I will never purchase another lexmark"
1,Pure Nightmare,"Lexmark is the nightmare of the home user!! Replaced the printer twice: Endless paper jams, printer communication issues, horizontal noise on color printouts and to top this off poor customer support from the Athens, Greece office."
3,Don't Bother!,"The main reasons I purchased this printer are: 1. Price and 2. The advertised quality of color printing.It was easy to set up and install, but after printing the first test page I was very disappointed. There was obvious horizontal banding, even after aligning and cleaning the print heads.I returned this printer and purchased an HP Photosmart 7550 from Amazon.com (no tax & free shipping = substantial savings for me).This printer would be fine for someone who only wants to print black and white documents, but if you plan on printing digital photos or color documents, look elsewhere!"
1,Crapped out after about 12 months,"Bought this thing at the end of the Summer. Hardly used it because I do alot of black and white on an old reliable HP laser printer. This Lexmark just bit the dust after about 10 real uses. Paper shoots out then it just keeps whirring until I unplug it, smells like melting plastic .. to top it off I bought the spare ink cartridges."
2,Look somewhere else....,"I would not recommend this printer. Oh sure - it worked pretty well for about 8 months. The ""cannot find printer"" errors were frequent and frustrating, but overall the print quality was okay.Today it appears the wheel that pulls the paper into the printer has crapped out. If you consider the time my boss will pay me to pack this thing up, the time to dig out the old receipts to satisfy the warranty, and the cost of shipping it in to be fixed.... it's cheaper to buy a new printer."
2,Stanley Tools book not really a genuine price guide.,"For a book that claims to be a price guide, it is a rather dissapointing publication. The book consists entirely of reprinted Stanley catalogs from 1909 and 1926. The ""price guide"" to current values merely consists of a loose page inserted into the book. The loose, 2002-2003 current price guide page that I received was not even cut square! The prices quoted are questionable at best (a stanley #212 in ""good"" condition for $700!??. I'll take half a dozen, thanks.), with no genuine attempt to clarify price variation as a function of tool type or condition. In the introdcuction the editor so rightly points out that ""We do not claim to be experts in the tool collecting field (and the) seperate price guide is only the opinion of the editor."""
4,Reprint Of A Classic Stanley Tools Book With Updated Pricing,"Tool collectors will enjoy this interesting and useful book of nearly 300 pages which is a reprint of the complete original 1909 and 1926 Stanley Tools Catalogs. The softbound, handy-sized book contains more than 1,200 black and white pictures and details of the tools. It is complete with the original indexes, making tool location easy. A special insert contains year 2001 pricing. Everyone interested in these historical tools will enjoy using this great reference work. Take it with you when you antique for old tools. Add it to your reference library."
2,Formulaic and trite,"I really enjoyed the historical aspects of this book, but I couldn't help but find the characters and situations a bit trite. None of the characters seemed to really come to life and the storyline is a bit predictable."
2,"Lots of excellent homework, but barely readable...","I was facinated by the history in this book, but it made me want to read, well, a history book. There's nothing real or compelling about the characters, and the stories that Wheeler weaves around the earthquake are interesting for their details, but not for their human drama."
1,Worthless,"While the frame itself looks nice (glossy black metallic), the bolt covers don't work at all. They don't snap on securely, and the clear plastic washer that the bolt covers are meant to snap onto break easily.What's the point of having a nice looking black license plate frame if your nasty zinc bolts are showing?Save your money."
3,"Informative, partisan, and in need of an editor","This biography does provide a kind of overview of twentieth century politics in New York City, but the views expressed are highly partisan, and the writing is often awkward and uneven. The author is especially critical of Bloomberg, refusing to acknowledge that he has managed some innovations of his own, not related to Guiliani's policies. There is balance in this biography though, as Siegal does acknowledge Rudy's propensity for shooting himself in the foot during his second term as Mayor."
4,Giuliani's war with the bureauocy of the City of NY and the State of NY.,"Too much unimportant detail. Not enough about Giuliani's personal life and not enough about 9-11-01.Interesting and one wonder's how he got anything done with the mani baricades set up by the Teachers Unions, the Firemen's Unions, the Policemen Unions, the Governor of the State of New York, the State Legislature and the New York City Council.It is amazing he could get anything done with the corrupt and inefficient New York School System.He was a tough, very intelligent man and probably should be elected President of the United States when Bush goes.John R. Bloomer Sr., 4902 Longview Drive - Godfrey, Il 62035-1643Age 79 -- WWII Combat Veteran of the United States Navy and very proud of it.================================================================"
2,Just you'd expect,"Giuliani toady writes biography of patron. It's just what you'd expect.It's great to have so many points of view in a tumultuous era, but I doubt that this one will become a key reference."
2,"Unserious analysis, still a decent primer","This is a by-the-numbers puff piece. The author hammers on certain points repeatedly (Reagan was great for poor blacks, gets 'proven' three times in the first half of the book alone). Reader is assumed not to know much history (we're reminded a couple of times about when World War II was). Piece as a whole is unclever, though it gets fun in places. It seems clear the author is connected to the DLC, and therefore has an interest in throwing the Liberalism of the 60s and 70s under the bus. While that is a valid topic for a book, it is important to note that this is not an attempt at academic history. It is an attempt to glorify some and blame others, by telling a story a certain way.With that said, this book is better than nothing; you will learn some key names, places, events, and so on."
5,Great for its price,"Although non-stick takes a little longer to heat up to the temperatures necessary for wok cooking, this wok is great for its price. Easy for a lazy college student like me to clean up after when I finally get up the nerve to cook non canned foods. Very affordable, easy to use, and easy to clean."
2,It is STICK!! do not buy,"I am so dissapointed with this piece. It is stick, not non-stick. You will get serious problem when you fry meat. Do not buy it - this is the suggestion I can give it to you."
2,Rusts too easily,"It's a very cheap piece of cookware, and it is kind of non-stick. I used it one time with a bamboo steamer, meaning that I had to place water in the bottom to boil, and afterwards I noticed that the bottom of the pan was a bit rusted. The metal screw on the lid also rusted.I figured it would be fine if I just used it to steam things then, and the second time I steamed something the entire bottom of the pan rusted, and my food and bamboo steamer came out smelling very funny.If you are very careful with it, or don't cook much at all, it might be worth it, but otherwise I would invest in something a little less flimsy."
1,It is STICK!! do not buy,"I am so dissapointed with this piece. If you cook meat, it is very easily get stick. I think the stick layer is too thin so that it does not work very well.DO NOT BUY IT."
1,"Very thin nonstick coating, smaller than expected cooking area.","Unlike others, I found the nonstick coating to be effective at keeping things from sticking. However, it got peeled off in spots on the very first use, and that is with using only a wooden spatula to cook and a soft sponge to clean. Also the center of the wok is flat and very small, and the side slope up at a high angle from the center, so really food only gets cooked in the 5""-diameter center area. It is not really a hemisphere like traditional woks are, which acts to spread out the heat in a gradient from the center and allows for easier stirring as you fry. (It's called stir-fry for a reason)."
3,NORPRO WOK,A very nice wok. The price made it even a better deal.Solid and sturdy.Would reccomend this product to anybody.
1,How do you rate something that is 5 weeks overdue,"I can offer a real rating when the supplier decides to ship my merchandise. I ordered it for someone's birthday and then had to go out to the store to buy a different present because mine failed to ship in time. If someone else has had this problem, please speak out now"
1,dissatisfied amazon customer,"I ordered this product on June 6th and keep getting delays on shipment on this item. One that I received weeks ago said that the item was on hand and would be shipped, but later got one that said there was going to be a delay on shipment. What's going on here. I have been ordering from you guys for a long time and have in the past recommended you to lots of friends and family. Please let me know the problem, I really need this product.Pat"
1,what a waste of trees...,"Not without my daughter, is now known, was a fictional story to the still married Betty Mahmoody....as in still married to her ""tyrannical"" husband. He also recieved many of the proceeds that the book and movie made. This book is utterly distasteful, and a waste of time. I am tired of seeing Iran portrayed through such racial and prejudice views. The sad thing is that people will actually buy this book, and believe it. If I could rate this book with something other than one through five stars I would give it a NEGATIVE five stars. Don't waste ur time."
2,Sour grapes....,"This book is actually fairly well-written compared with a lot of the anti-Mormon literature that's out there. However, one can safely assume that Ms. Scott's being ""Dear Janed"" by the LDS boyfriend who introduced her to the church was the driving factor in her becoming disenchanted with it. Thus, while it is true that Ms. Scott spent some years as a member of the Mormon Church, she probably isn't the most objective of sources. (It's curious that she gives the obligatory first-person account of the Mormon temple endowment ceremony, even though one must assume she never actually witnessed it herself, inasmuch as single women who didn't have missionary calls rarely received their endowments in her day.)The irony of it all is that the boyfriend later became a general authority in the church, which points up the fine line that can exist between being the wife of a honcho in the Mormon Church and a bitter author of anti-Mormon literature."
5,Black and Blue,"The backstreetBoys did a great job on this CD.I think the best song on the CD is ""What Makes You Different( Makes you Beautiful)"" but, that's just my opinion. All the songs are good but some kind of sound like the kinds of songs they made when they started singing."
3,not as good as the last but worth listening to.,"When Millenium came out, I could not get BSB's music out of my head. I thought it was the greatest CD. I still do think it's really good. Black and Blue, however, didn't disappoint me, but definitely didn't excite me. The Call and Shape of my Heart aren't too special, and I started to notice that most of their songs sounded a lot alike. You kind of hear the same beat over and over, they all kind of sound like The One from Millenium. I still listen to it, and if you really like BSB, it is worth buying. Just don't expect it to be as good as the last one because it will most likely fall short."
3,"Eh, so-so album.","The CD is something you would expect from the Backstreet Boys. Mostly the same old songs with nothing too much new too expect. The music got repetitive to me and a bit boring. I do enjoy the music, but their previous album was much better than their new CD."
3,"Uh, what happened?","I must say that I am quite disappointed in the album. I'm not really a BSB fan but the songs from the Millenium album were so catchy, I couldn't help but buy the CD. I was surprisingly pleased with it as most of the songs were very good. I expected this CD to be of the same quality but this was not the case. Most of the songs on Black and Blue sound like extra songs that weren't good enough to make it on the Millenium album. Most of the songs are just plain bad. I'd return this CD if I could get a refund."
5,Black & Blue,Backstreet boys. My favorite group singers. I thank Amazing people for making it possible for me to get their CD at affordable price. I love you Backstreet boys. Go boys! Keep doing it right for us.
5,The maturity increases with every cd...,"I have been a BSB fan for many years, and I own all their cds. I've noticed a pattern with each cd they release. A good pattern. The Boys mature. The songs on their first album fit the class ""bubble gum pop."" But Millennium showed everyone that they are not just out there for the ""teenyboppers."" Black & Blue surpasses even that. The harmonies are excellent. They send chills down my spine and leave goosebumps on my arms. The Boys sing about important issues like the consequences of cheating (The Call), not being with the right man (Get Another Boyfriend), and best friends who fall in love (How Did I Fall in Love With You). They haven't done a complete 180 from what we came to know and love, but they are evolving. Adapting to a world of listeners greater than teens."
1,"Blue on Backstreet ""Black and Blue""","The beautiful harmonies that made the Backstreet Boys famous are not to be found anywhere on this new album, with the exception of ""Shape of My Heart."" The lyrics on the remaining songs are poor, there's too much techno-babble posing as music, and the boys voices sound strained as they try to match the non-melodic music of the songs on this new CD.Rating: Two thumbs down"
3,Doing what they do best,"The best I can say is that ""Shape of My Heart"" is one of their best songs ever. The worst I can say is BSB doesn't break any new ground. That isn't to say this is a bad album. There is something for everyone here but it sounds pretty much like an extension of ""Millennium"".The album's opener ""The Call"" (and reportedly the next single) is a funky uptempo similar to ""Larger Than Life"". It's sure to be a big hit. Other highlights: ""The Answer to Our Life"" and ""Everyone"" (which though derivative of ""Everybody"" is still pretty catchy.)All in all, a very listenable album, a solid effort that's sure to sell millions of copies."
2,Hmmmmmm,"I know 2 stars may seem a little harsh, but I must say I was disapointed with this album. While I am far from being a diehard backstreet boys fan, I was an avid listener to their two previous cds. Their sophomore album, in my opinion, showed a lot of growth from their first effort. The lyrics were deeper, the vocals were smoother, and the topics were more ""mature."" Because of this growth, I was really looking forward to their third album. Unfortunatly, I must say I found it rather disapointing. The album, to me, seemed to go backwards. The vocals are definately crisper and smoother, but the songs and lyrics lacked appeal in my opinion. As important as vocals are, good lyrics can cause an album to have huge success, and bad ones can definately hurt the album. The songs just felt very ""recycled."" If you really want the album I'd suggest borrowing a friend's copy first so that you know you like it before you invest the money."
4,Mature Backstreet MEN!,"I have been a Backstreet Boys fans since their first CD and this is by far the best one they've released so far. It shows that they're older and more mature. The CD is excellent. I was doubtful that the Backstreet Boys could surpass my favorite all male band, 98 Degrees, but the two have totally different sounds. They're both fabulous, and if this is the direction the Backstreet Boys are headed they are going to be around a lot longer than people have predicted. Both me, I'm 26, and my brother, who's [a lot younger], love this album!"
5,New and Improved,"Going from the raw techno and club type music of their debut album to the hyper-polished ""Milennium,"" BSB bridge the past and pave the way for the future....A lot of the best of BSB...great upbeat dance music (""Get Another boyfriend,"" ""Shining Star, The Call), nice Top 40 love songs (Shape of My Heart, How Did I Fall in Love With You), as well as good basic R&B and harmonizing (Shape of My Heart, Get Another Boyfriend and others). OK the rhymes in Shape of My Heart may be a bit off, and so may 2 or 3 of Nick's hairdo's but in general the album is more sophisticated and more down to earth, if only somewhat less inspired than the debut album...Still, no major disappointments, and a lot of listening pleasure for this BSB fan. PS. the loss of one of their most talented songwriters seems to have been met bravely and squarely; one or all of the Boys may prove to be great songwriters, given enough practice. ecadow@hotmail.com"
1,Poor Quality,"I am a BIG fan of BSB, but I have to admit this album is horrible and will probably end up being used as a coffee holder or put in the dust pile. There are only a couple of good songs and they are SOMH and It's True along with the song Everything I Am. I suggest you buy their cd Millennium if you want to hear quality music."
2,Didn't do much for me . . .,"I was somewhat disappointed in this CD! I am a big fan of ""Millennium"" and expected the same quality of music. Most of the songs are so boring that you can't even get into them. I hate buying a CD and flipping through songs to find one that I like and that's exactly what I'm doing with this CD. If you are a BSB fan, (but not a die-hard) and you are considering buying this CD think twice. There are only a few good songs and you should save your money and download, from Napster, ""Shape of my heart"", ""The Call"" and possibly ""Get Another Boyfriend"". I not only wish I could get my money back for the CD, but also the time I spent finding a store that wasn't sold out of it."
4,Cool,"I have only listened to the first 3 songs, but this CD already looks good. I have the Millennium CD, plus the other one, so I have 3 CDs of the Backstreet Boys. In my opinion, if the other 2 were so good, the other 11 songs I haven't heard yet have GOT to be good."
2,big disappointment,"Compared to Millenium, this album is downright horrible. Bland tunes and lyrics make a less than enjoyable sound. Catchy songs from their older albums are instantly replaced by songs that are at two opposite ends, either too rough-sounding (the march-like rhythm of ""The Call"") or so draggingly slow and overly dramatic that it makes you sick(""I Promise You"", ""It's True""). No standout tracks on this album, except for maybe ""shape of my heart"". ""Yes, I Will"" had a potentially good sound and was enjoyable until the lyrics ""...and someday start a family with you"" BLECH. I can't help from shaking my head in despair or wincing. you can't get more superficial than that. Sounds like they all got drunk for this. Even their debut album, however lacking in maturity, was far better than this. At least it had some slick tunes."
1,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed when I bought this cd. To me it sounded just like Millinium. The only song that I sorta liked was The call. Other than tht I hated this album.
5,BSB is awesome compared to NSuck!,"If you are a true BSB fan, you can hear the difference in how they've chnaged and matured since ""Millenium"". Nobody is better than BSB, NSuck are copycats."
2,Sorry Bsb fans this album is the pits!!,"Black and blue is a really horrible album. The only good song is ""The Call""!!! other than that it is the worst album of the year!!!Black and blue: D+"
2,"BLACK, BLUE,BATTERED & BRUISED.","BLACK AND BLUE IS A DISSAPPOINTING FOLLOW UP TO 'MILLENIUM.OF THE 15 OR SO TRACKS THERE ARE ONLY TWO OR THREE SONGS WORTHY OF INCLUSION ON THE ALBUM. THE REMAINING SONGS DONT PASS MUSTER AND IT SEEMS MANY OF THOSE TRACKS HAVE BEEN PENNED BY VAROUS MEMBERS OF THE BAND. THE ADAGE OF'STICK TO WHAT YOU KNOW'COULDN'T BE MORE APT WHEN APPLIED TO 'THE BOYS' TALENTS AS SONGWRITERS. A TOKEN ONE OR TWO TO TREAD THE WATERS IS O.K BUT THE ALBUM HAS WAY TOO MAY TRACKS PENNED BY THE BAND WHICH JUST DONT PASS THE GRADE FOR SUCH A HIGH PROFILE BAND.I ASSUME THAT THE WRITERS WHO USUALLY PEN THEIR MATERIAL HAVE SPREAD THEMSELVES TOO THIN BY WRITING FOR OTHER ARTISTS AS WELL AND THE BAND HAS BEEN LEFT SHORT OF MATERIAL FOR THE ALBUM AND NOW THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. QUALITY CONTROL SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE MEASURE BUT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THE MESSAGE IS 'NEVER MIND THE QUALITY,FEEL THE WIDTH!"
1,this aint the rolling stones album,black and blue is the name of this horrible album which these backstreet thugs blatantly and unashamedly stole from the legendary stones.this music reeks.it is one of the worst of the worst.AN ABSOLUTELY AVOIDABLE TRAVESTY OF AN ALBUM.get the original black and blue album from the stones instead.minus trillion stars.
1,interesting album name only,"Black and blue's release was hyped up the backstreet boys travelled to each continent in the first week of the album release and made a documentary to beat the first week sales of Millenium, didn't happen. That just goes to show they care more about the hype and popularity more than the musical quality. Sure they began writing their own songs on this CD but it still sounds all the same as their other songs though Shape of My Heart is a catchy ballad and The Call shows a little bit of artistic growth though something about it sounds like I heard it in the 80's. Black and blue? Interesting album name but by then they were black and blue from being overhyped and the girls growing up and getting sick of them, I knew THAT would roll around"
2,This Is VERY Close to a Disaster,"Like the two albums that come before it, ""Black and Blue"" is a borderline release that has only a couple noteworthy songs. ""The Call"" is an upbeat number from Max Martin that could be among his best (which isn't really saying much), while the gentle ballad ""More Than That"" is above average and passes along well. Elsewhere, it's Snoozeville. ""Shape of My Heart"" is a twice-Xeroxed version of ""I Want it That Way,"" and nothing else on the album seems to be of interest. BSB may or may not deserve the harsh treatment they get from critics, but they have yet to release a good album. Sorry, kids, but this won't do."
1,Terrible,"How was this CD ever #1 on the charts? Its boring,the music just isn't good, its not gripping and it doesn't make you think. Its not true music its not music that comes from the soul, the 5 ""boys"" didn't even write it themselves. 30 years from now we won't remember the Backstreet Boys music, we won't remember ""Shape Of My Heart"", 30 years from now we'll remember real muscians like Kurt Cobain... don't let these no talent fools be in your cd player. Go buy a Led Zeppelin CD and let them show you what music truly is."
2,BLACK AND BLUE ALL OVER,"The only standout song on this CD is ""The Call"" where the Backstreet Boys finally had some guts to do a edgier song.The rest of the album like ""Shape of My Heart"" is the same re-trashed factory ballad 5 boy band cookie cutter songs.I am sure all the teenage girls will just beat me up on this one, but come on girls!, how many times can you hear the same version of the same ballad with a different title?!I think this group will have a couple of more albums in them popularity wise with the girls, but when watching MTV and girls are already saying they are OLD, is not a good sign.Backstreet Boys welcome to Debbie Gibson-Tiffany-Rick Astley Land where you will one day be a has been.Of course you are running all the way to the bank....lucky you. It is always the people with no talent that get all the glory.The Beatles YOU ARE NOT."
4,"Ballads, ARGHHHHHHHH!!!","The Call: Lame, very lame message, great tune, awsome dance song- 4.9/ Shape Of My Heart: Great message, I HATE ballads, so in my case- 0.1/ Get Another Boyfriend- Great message, great dance song- 5.0/ Shining Star: Great dance song, but for some reason, it irratates me, like Lil'Romeo, too many high notes- 3.0/ I Promise You: Sad, I think I'm going to cry, I HATE BALLADS!!!! Ahhhh!- 0.0/ The Answer To Our Lives, GREAT! Their voices shine! But it's a ballad, LAME! I suddenly hate it, but it's not a ballad, weird: 4.0/ Everyone, GREAT!!!!!!! Yea, rock on!!!- 5.0 (Ya, know it needs more stars, but, then this whole rating would be very unbalanced)/ More Then That, the only ballad I like: 5.0/ I will only review these, since I have limited time!"
4,Worth your money :),"Okay, I really like Backstreet Boys most recent CD ""Black and Blue."" It's not as ""catchy"" you might say but that's just because they are trying to expand their audience and not be so stuck in the ""pop"" catorgory. My fav songs on the CD would be ""The Call"" ""Get Another Boyfriend"" ""Answer to Our Life"" ""More than that"" and ""How did I Fall in Love with you."" How did I fall in love with you is the MOST beautiful song. Seriously. You just have to hear it and it will melt your heart. There are a few songs that I don't necessairly think should have been kept on the album like ""It's True"" or ""I Promise You."" But that's like any other CD.. most of the time there's a few songs that you don't love. Anyway, please ya'll support this CD and buy it! You won't regret it :)"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,I am a big BSB fan and always liked them because there fans were more important to them than music reviews unlike N'sync they were more down to earth but this album sounds like something N'Sync would do ot The Backstreet Boys!
2,"Not the best, But alright . . .","My first reaction to this new album was disappointment. Nothing like their 'Millennium' album, which was a great success. A LOT of the songs on this album sound alike. When you listen to half the songs, the instrumentals overpower their vocals and you can't tell what they are singing. A couple of the songs on their new album sound a lot like N'Syncs' music. Not my favorite album."
3,I'll stick to Millenium,"I'm a huge fan of BSB and although Black and Blue is good, it doesn't compare to their last album, Millenium. Black and Blue has it's hits: such as ""Shape of My Heart"" and ""The Call"", but ""I Promise You (With Everything I Am)"" is so horrible that I'm surprised it made it on the album. Every Backstreet Boys fan should own this, but if you're looking for the better BSB album I'd stick to Millenium."
4,Great! Buy It!,"This is a good album! I think if you want your collection complete buy ""Hangin' Tough"" by New Kids On the Block, believe me you will love that album. Also buy the original Backstreet Boys album it's their best album. Also buy Paula Abdul's album ""Forever Your Girl"" That is a great album. This Backstreet Boys album is really good! Buy It!"
5,The Best of the BSB!!!,"I totally love this album. It's truly the best of the three they've done. The first song, ""The Call"" is an excellent song with a great beat. Slower, love songs such as ""Shape of My Heart"" and ""More Than That"" are completely fabulous. I just can't get enough of this album. All the other songs on this CD are great as well, with great melodies, and excellent harmonies. I can't believe how great they sound either singing together or solo."
3,Not the Best But...,"I am a hugh BSB fan but I have to be honest that this CD is just ok. I like the other two A LOT better. It is a def must have for every die hard BSB fan, but I would not want someone that has never purchased a BSB cd to get this one and form their opinion about them for this cd. Some of the songs are ok but I def like the other 2 cd's much much better."
1,IS THIS REAL MUSIC ???,"SIMPLY PUT,I FIND THE CANDY COATED NONSENSE THESE BOYBANDS TURN OUT RIDICULOUS. AMONG THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY AND OTHERS WHO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MUSIC, THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A MONEY MAKING BUSINESS AIMED AT THE VERY YOUNG WHO LITERALLY FALL HEAD OVER HEELS AND EAT THIS UP. MEMBERS OF THESE BANDS SHOW ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE TALENTS THAT REAL SINGER/SONGWRITERS POSSESS AND THEREFORE DONT, RIGHTFULLY SO, RECIEVE THE RESPECT OF THIER CONTEMPORARIES COME GRAMMY TIME. ONE COULD SAY THIS MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT FUN AND GOOD TIMES BUT SHOULD THAT NOT DESERVE QUALITY AS WELL? ITS A SHAME WE HAVE LOWERED OUR STANDARDS TO SUCH AN EXTENT."
1,This music is for saps,People... if you want any REAL music go buy a METALLICA album or a NIRVANA album. This stuff is just boring...
2,Nothing new and nothing gained!,"Poor Backstreet! Where have they gone? Though ""Black & Blue"" still sold well on the market, it was definitely a failure. They don't seem to progress or grow up through the years, and even make retreat. This is pathetic.Yeah, the album's very BSB style, and easy to get accustomed to when playing. But it should be sufficient if you already have ""Millennium."" Or betterstill, get their ""Greatest Hits"" instead of this one.The only reason I bought this album was due to Brian's vocal. Nevertheless, he seemed to have shared his singing parts with AJ, so the temptations had gone. It pleased me that Nick didn't sing too much on the CD, though."
5,Great CD,"Why must every review compare it to NSync and whether or not it will break the record. The BSB are they're own group. This album is great even if they only sell 2! Breaking a record is not what makes a cd great, they songs are. And this is cd is full of wonderful songs."
2,*NSYNC vs. Backsreet Boys,"Some people might say I'm being prejudiced because I absolutely love *NSYNC but I feel that Black&Blue is a sorry album. All I seem to hear of Backstreet Boys are all these slow and sorta sad songs. I like songs with a nice beat, like *NSYNC's songs. But Backstreet is okay."
3,Too boring for my blood,"Well, this CD sucks a lot more than any of the other ones. I'm more into the upbeat songs, but if you like soft rock, and BSB, you'll like this CD. (They're still a hell of a lot better than N Sync, but not as good as 98 Degrees)"
3,Three stars for effort...,"Ok, what can I say? I expected so much more out of this album. The guys said it would have all different genres of music on it, and that it was a growth,but I beg to differ. Most of the songs sounded alike and were completley...well...stupid. I wouldn't reccomend this album to anyone, unless of course you are a die hard BSB fan."
5,I love this album!!!,"I love my BSB!!! I had this CD long ago, and somehow misplaced it! But, now I have it. That makes me feel sooo happy! Thank you!!!"
5,"A True ""Shining Star""","With all the imitation bands out there it is clear to see that the one great boy band is the Backstreet Boys. They wow me every time I hear a new album. Each one has gotten progressively better. Black & Blue is no exception. With beautiful ballads like ""Yes I Will"" and ""More Than That"" and great up-tempo songs like ""The Call"" and ""Shining Star"" the Backstreet Boys blend the songs into a truly amazing CD that was completely worth my hard earnedmoney. I just wish the tour was coming to my town so I could see it live!"
5,Suprised Me,"I dont buy music because the artists are ""hot"" (especially in this case, cuz im a boy), but I buy it because of talent. The Backstreet Boys have proven themselves to be the best boy band out there with this new CD. It is full of smooth ballads and hot pop gems that are just waiting to explode. The boys could definitely expect some Grammy Nominations, that they deserve, and a lot of great success with this album. I congratulate the boys on sticking with their winning formula, yet taking it to the next level. If your a fan of great talent and hard workers... then ""Black and Blue"" is the album for you."
1,"Black and Blue? Not so good, after all...","I was quite anxious to hear what the Backstreet Boys could come up with on this album. I was expecting a great follow up album from ""Millennium"". What I got, however, was digitally altered noise and velveeta cheese in the form of music. Now, I love boy bands and pop music like I love air, but there is a fine line between sweet lyrics and pure corn. The Backstreet Boys crossed that line by the second track, possibly even the first. Too busy trying to boot rivals *NSYNC from the top and reclaim the title of fastest selling album, the guys seem more focused on sales figures than quality music. If it's humor you're looking for, listen to ""The Call"". This song will NOT bring them respect in the musical community. (I gave this album one star just for the laugh that track gave me) Predictable rhymes run rampant on this album, which make the songs yawn worthy. While trying to ""take it to the next level"" the boys have lost their roots, and at least one fan: me."
3,Same Old Stuff,"I have always preferred Nsync over teh Backstreet Boys, buy I love both the Backstreet Boys debut CD and Millenium. Black and Blue however is a big step down for the guys. Vocally they are still very good, and it's not that the songs are bad, I actually like all of them, it's just that they all sound like everyother backstreet boy song. Take Shape of My Heart the first single. It sounds exactly like I Want it That Way. They even have a song called Everyone, which should be called Everybody Part 2. The only really highlights are the 2 ending ballads It's True and How Did I Fall in Love With You-2 gorgeaous ballads performed beautifully by the guys. When Nsync came out this year with No Strings Attached they took a risk by changing pop music to ""dirty pop"" with funky beats, suggestive lyrics, and a lot more edge. They took a chance and it worked, the Backstreet Boys played it safe by recycling the same old material."
2,All the same,I loved both of their other CDs but Black & Blue's songs all sound the same. They are either slow or fast but that's the only difference. I do like a few of the songs though but I regret buying the CD.
1,What the hell happened?,"This will be remembered as the CD where the Backstreet Boys sold out to the masses. Gone is the exciting thrash and speed metal of their previous albums. They have turned into a pop group. I loved them back in the day when they were opening up for bands like Slayer and Coal Chamber. I loved them when lead singer Nick Carter had that vicious growly voice everyone tried to copy. I loved them because of Howie's brutal rhythm guitar and Brian's frenetic soloing and the great double bass drums of Kevin. They don't even play guitar on this album. This is by far the most astonishing career turnaround I have ever seen. I am disappointed, shocked, and pissed as hell. At least I still have their old stuff to bang my head to."
1,Do yourself a favor and burn it,"Ok, I know I'll get flamed for this...But settle down about the ""I love them they are so sweet"" stuff. They are MUSICIANS, nothing more. And they make a big deal about writing SOME of their songs. Big whoop. Its pop. Simple useless pop that the world could live without. Its a big money maker for the record companies because 10-17 year old girls dont listen to rock and roll. So reel in the dough with your ""same song over and over"" buisness, and keep up the sad, but good work. I envy your genious in coming up with such schemes."
1,yuck-blech-pooey,"oh please could this album be any worse, all you music fans out there do yourself a favor and go buy (if you dont already have it) No Strings Attached by *NSYNC, because it is A WHOLE LOT BETTER and much more fun to listen to. This is disposable lightweight pop. Do yourself a favor and dont waste your money."
2,A dissappointment for some BSB fans,"I think that this album really bombed. Although the guys sounded good (they didn't sound like they were singing from inside a box, like with their first album) I didn't like the lyrical content, which I found really really cheezy. the only songs that I really like are Shape of my heart, and More Than That. Millenium was their best album, and I don't think that they can top it."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"They were not able to surpass their last album Millenium. Nsync has it all over them. Plus, they are getting way too impressed with themselves. No longer a joy to watch or listen to."
1,Very Consitent Group,Backstreet Boys have done it again. I never thought after the pathetic album Millenium that they could do it again but they proved me wrong. This cd is even worse. The most untalented group today has come out with another untalented album. Congrats boys. ....
1,They've completely lost it!,"The boys were on a roll, but it appears time is starting to catch up with these so called ""artists"". Black and Blue will leave you feeling black and blue all over, utter rubbush to say the least. I wish compact disc were a little bigger and thicker so I could at least save this utterly disappointing effort for something useful...like frisbee on the beach this summer, heaven knows it won't ever find it's way back into my boombox!"
3,okay,"i recently recived black and blue as a birthday present, but once i got around to hearing it, i was disapointed. with over used lyrics in most songs, i found it very repetitive. 'he's just another playa', playin in the name of love'(get another boyfriend) i thought dat song wuz just stupid. i anticipated it to be better than Millennium, but most of it wuz just uptempo songs, and not as catchy as their previous ones. although i really liked, How Did I Fall In Love With You, which is areally really sweet song. otherwise, it wuz an okay album for them."
2,Black & Blue because their album should take a beating,"Can you say ""Released too quickly""? I was disappointed with the Boys' latest venture. I give them credit for breaking whatever record they broke by releasing this album, ooh ! BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT !! when you have little teenie-boppers begging their parents to fork up the allowance in advance. I give it two stars for the two hits 'Shape of my Heart' and 'It's True'. The hype was overrated and their work didn't live up to it. It seemed rushed because all the other boy bands were releasing their albums, so they had to get it to the people. Don't think that I'm a 'boy band hater.' I love their other work and all the other work from the other boy bands. But for my hard earned money, go get the new 98 degrees album, Revelation; it will be more worth it."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"...I'm a big backstreet fan, but this CD was disappointing. All the fast songs sound the same and have so many superfluous digital sounds that it makes your head hurt. Most of them even sound like carbon copies of Britney Spears' songs. Some of the topics are so cheesy (ie The Call) that 2+gether could've recorded them. The ballads are surprisingly bland. I was hoping to hear a lot of great vocals on this CD.... By reading the reviews already posted here, it seems like it's all about breaking N'Sync's record, not the music. And the music is definitely what BSB should've focused on- not rushing out another album to gain back some light. But to end on a positive note, I like the songs ""Time"" and ""Shining Star""(which is what the one star is for). I know I'm supposed to be a supportive fan, but in writing this review, I have to be honest- this CD's not at all great."
2,My Christmas Present,"This BSB album is bought from my maid as a Christmas gift. Well,it really disappointed me because the songs aren't great at all!! I like their previous album Millienium and another one more than this one. :("
2,black and blue all over,"Well what can I Say another poor atempt to beat the competition.Nync. Once they Brian and AJ Got married it was over. Now they are releasing these ""songs"". To try to beat Nsync Not gonna happin. They have lost there way they dont know how to appeal to the largest market out there. Teens. Sorry guys This just doesnt cut it. So if you a BSB fan think before you buy."
1,The Songs Sound The Same,"B&B sounds like the debut album and Millennium. If you want to hear the same songs, with different words, this is the album for you. There is no growth or change. The BSB have not grown into men yet."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I've been a fan of them since 97' and i just love them. They have definitely grown up with their sound. My favs are 'The Call', 'Get Another Boyfriend', 'Shape Of My Heart', Shining Star, Everyone. But one song really touched me 'More Than That'. This album has something for everyone in it pop, rock, r&b.... You should DEFINITELY and i mean DEFINITELY buy it!P.S If you don't want to, stick to Digital Get Down (talking about cyber s**)"
4,"Good CD, little more adult and slower than before","The Backstreet Boys are growing up and it shows. The songs on this disc are all strong, but they seem to have mellowed some, and I am not saying that is a bad thing. This album is more hevily loaded with ballads and in that I think they are playing to their strengths.All in all it appears that they are moving beyond their rivals in *NSync and getting out of the light pop somewhat and that is good. As always their vocals are excellent."
5,One Listen.... And You'll Be Hooked!,"This is by far the best album the BSB have ever released. There is something for everyone on this CD... there's the Backstreet pop sound, rock, r&b, hip hop, country, and even a bit of a latin sound. Not a BSB fan? Give this CD a try anyway, you may be suprised. The best tracks on this album are suprisingly the ones the BSB themselves wrote. I highly recommend this CD to ANY music fan!"
3,"You know, the hype","I think the backstreet boys are a great band but they have gone through so many changes and grown up that I perceive them to be forcing something that may not be there anymore here they opened the door for all those boy bands to come out of the hiding spots that it may be time that they make an encore exit and get on with their lives as individuals, they are not even close to topping the records with nsync and 98 degrees.....but that is just my thought....The only song that I really liked was one and the shape of my heart. To make a successful CD you have to have at least four songs that you can absolutely live and tolerate and possibly like this one didn' even make two and a half for me"
5,Backstreet Boys Groove,I admit I had to listen to the CD a few times to get a feel for the new songs. I am now addicted to it!! I love all of the fast songs...so many potential hits! Their voices sound better than ever. I am a full fan of this new CD. Definitely buy it and get into the groove!
3,BSB meet Ricky Martin?,"Fully prepared to add ""it's for my little sister"" asI shamefacedly bought the CD at a local store, I'm glad I didn't, as I'm fully enjoying the new, more mature, extremely danceable and infinitely more exciting tracks of BSB's latest. ""The Call"", surprisingly infused with a Ricky Martin rhythm, has me power walking to work and astounding passers-by with sudden jerky movements. ""Get another boyfriend"" is a great vocal display, and you can't really find fault in their predictably good ballads. Pretty decent quality, if you know what you're buying. In fact, I can only object to the ludicrous advice their stylists keep giving them, and the baffling Born Again credits on the CD sleeve. Back Street Altar Boys indeed!!!"
3,Absolutely surprising,"Let me say this. I never really liked the Backstreet Boys, or any other boy band. I really harrassed my 9-year old brother when he got this CD. Then I listened to it, and it really is great. I thought by now BSB would be sucked into the whole cheesy pop realm, but they're not. Their modesty and pure style makes their music that much more enjoyable. I have more respect for their music than any other boy band. ""The Call"" is a different style song to open the CD that will get you to hit repeat quickly. ""Shape of My Heart"" is bland, and nothing more. ""Get Another Boyfriend""... can you guess Max Martin wrote it? At first I honestly thought it sounded like Britney's ""Oops!"", which Martin wrote. Moving ahead, ""I Promise You (With Everything I Am)"" is a great song. This might be the best ballad I've ever heard. Well, I think this basically sums up the rest of the CD as a must buy for any true pop music fan."
5,"My ""Black & Blue"" Review","I got the BSB's ""Black & Blue"" about a few days before it was due to be released, and when I heard the album, it became my favorite CD. There is so much variety on the CD, that I just can't pick a favorite song on the album (but I do especially love the parts where Nick sings). I let my friends (who think BSB are just okay) listen to the album, and they thought it was great and wanted to get a copy also. The CD is about real things that occur in our lives. My friends and I can totally relate to the songs on the CD. I would recommend this CD to everyone, not just teens because I am not one anymore, and I still love BSB's music. The songs are about things that many people of all ages can relate to. I got the version with the extra track (which is a really sweet song), but even if you can't get that version, the CD is still great without it."
5,BSB outdo themselves again!,"I have bought all 4 of the Backstreet Boys albumns and 'Black and Blue' is by far the best. As well as writing or co-writing most of the songs themselves, the BSB have combined all of their previous styles together on one albumn. My favourite tracks are 'The Call' and 'How did I fall in love with you', probably the two most differing tracks on the albumn. I highly recommend this albumn to anyone, whether you're a BSB fan or otherwise."
5,It's Just Keeps Getting Better,"Everytime someone comes out with a new album, by the 3rd time around, it sucks! However The Backstreet Boys just keep getting better and better. You can tell that their music has matured along with them, but still have that Backstreet sound. Usually on a CD I only like about 3-4 songs. The entire Black & Blue album is awesome. I recommend it to everyone!"
5,How about them Boys?,"This album is without a doubt, a wonderful treat to any die-hard BSB fan. It features delightfully pleasing ballads that far surpass the stereotypical boundaries of the cliche boy-band, thus it appeals to non-fans as well. This package also features a few of those infamous/infectious, up-beat songs that helped to establish the Boys' reputation as a cliche boy-band. Those non-fans who buy the album to hear the great ballads, will find it easy to skip around these overly ""popped"" tracts. The ""fan"" however, eagerly awaits those songs, and would be pleased with all of the tracts featured. It's a surprisingly great album."
1,Hmmm............,"When I first heard, ""Shape of My Heart"" I was like, ""Hey, this is a pretty good song."" But as I heard it for the third and fourth time, I started getting sick of it. The more and more I heard it, the more I got sick of it. Now when I hear it on the radio, I immediately turn it off. Then, when ""The Call"" came out, it happened the same way. What I'm trying to say is that the songs on this CD may sound good at first, but you'll soon get sick of them. Sick enough to barf."
2,A Disappointment,I was very disappointed with this newest CD. It sounds as if all the songs were just slopped together and thrown out there in time for the holidays.
1,"Very, Very, Very disappointed","My sister bought this CD yesterday, and she told me she hate it, then i try listening to it, and i also hate it."
1,Awful!,"Please, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I'm looking at the overall rating, then the album title, then the rating, then the title, and if I'm not reviewing the Backstreet Boys CD, then someone please tell me, because a 4 star rating for that CD is messed-up.They use voice enhancements! They aren't real! They just sell their bodys! UGH! They don't write. They don't produce. They really don't do anything but fill the piggy bank at Jive.Now, I'm going to give you some artists to check outPOP:Anna NalickNatasha BedingfieldTori AmosCeline DionKelly ClarksonGwen StefaniJohn MayerJack JohnsonROCK:Nine Inch NailsMxPxThe Goo Goo DollsThe AtarisEvanescenceMy Chemical RomanceChevelleNo wonder why people dislike pop! MTV and Top 40 has washed your brain cells with crap like this.Avoid ALL CDs by The BSB"
2,same old,"I was hoping that the BSB were going to do more songs like ""I want it that way"". Nope, all of these songs are just like the other songs and the boys are still boys. I Used to be their big fan, not anymore. They are just like N'Sync who have no artistic value."
1,somebody just kill them please,Do not buy this go buy a metallica cd or a KoRn cd or a marilyn manson cd maybe some nirvana but please if you have already bought it take a baeball bat to it or put it in the midell of the road and watch cars run it over.
2,This bites,"I loved the millenium CD and I also enjoyed the self titled one too. This CD, however, I can not even pretend to enjoy. It seemed their only motivation for this disc was to sell more than NSYNC because it sounds totally like they were trying to copy the NSYNC sound. I wouldn't buy this CD as it is a waste of money"
1,Bye Bye Bye to BSB,I've listen to this album.. and I will never listen to it again! IT's horrid! All the songs sound the same. They tried to make their music a little faster and added a techno beat to it! The on decent song on here is Shape of my Heart and that's it! It sounds as if they just put this album together in a week or something! They were too busy trying to compete with *NSYNC and didn't even hear your own album! You should not waste money on this kind of crap!
2,Alot Of Hype For Nothing,"Here I was thinking that BSB wouldn't follow in the steps on N Sync and Britney Spears, and here I come out disappointed. There was alot of hype to this c.d, and basically it sounded like a rip off of N Sync's latest c.d.And alot of the songs sounded similar.. I don't know I was just expecting something with more substance, some flavour and maybe some more maturity. Maybe it is because Iam not into this fad of eletronic sounds and alot of dance beats,but then all those beats just hide their voices. All in all this c.d wasn't as good as expected."
2,BSB needed more effort,"Yeah, so I give them credit for ""Shape of My Heart,"" it's pretty obvious why they chose the best song on the CD for their first single. And ""The Call"" is a good song too. But from here on down the CD goes bad. ""Get Another Boyfriend"" sounds just like ""The Call"" and every song after that is a slow one. Another thing...""Everyone"" and ""Everybody""...come on guys let's move on here!! Overall the CD isn't worth the money."
1,Get a Life,Go listen to some real music with bands that play their own music. Backstreet Boys suck and if I see them I'll make them black and blue.
5,Backstreet's Back and Better than Ever!!!,"After months of anticipation, the new Backstreet Boys album has finally hit the shelves. It has a variety of fast and slow paced songs, 5 being written by the Boys themselves(the lyrics are original, sweet, and sincere). Unfortunately for Kevin fans, he gets no solo parts. However, you can hear Howie's high voice reaching its peaks, contributing much to the quality... and for the Nick Carter fans, his voice pops up quite often. :) ""How Did I Fall In Love With You"" brought tears to my eyes for the sweet lyrics and voices and all of the other songs impressed me. Anyway, this is a great CD, better than words can say, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. Go order or buy a copy A.S.A.P! It's worth every penny!"
1,ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!,"All you teenage girls who want to hear real music about love and relationships with some meaning, I'm gonna save you real quick. This music (BSB, NSync, etc) will seem so shallow once you listen to the following album, go get it from your parents or the store. I'm 21, so this album came out even before I was born. But it was written during a divorce for the artist and is still considered the best pop album on relationships and love ever:Blood On The Tracks by Bob DylanIt is perfection. It makes what the boy bands are doing seem shallow and meaningless. They couldn't write a single line of any of these songs if they were locked away for years. Songs such as Tanngled Up In Blue, You're Gonna Make Me Lonesone When You Go, and You're A Big Girl Now will blow you away with emotions. This is what music is all about. It is musical poetry at its best.You'll thank me down the road for this one."
2,Signs Of Slowing Down...,"This album shows signs of slowing down for the Backstreet Boys in the sales and charts department. This album sold 8 million which isn't bad if you don't compare it to their other albums. This album features ""Shape Of My Heart"" Their only top 40 hit which hit 12, ""The Call"" hit a disappointing 52 and that is it. The album fell out of the top 40 album charts in 15 weeks and was quickly gone. This album shows their weaknesses and now in a changing music scene it will be even harder to stay on top."
1,Ugg...,"I liked The Backstreet Boys when they first came out. I even liked them through their Millennium stage but, I think that this CD was WAY below them. While some of their competing groups such as NSYNC have at least changed their style and written their own music these Boys are still teeny-boppers singing music by some unknown fat guy. I think that this CD deserved no stars but, that wasn't an option so I was forced to give it one, like they even derseve one."
5,BSB rocks,I have the c.d. and I can stop listening to it and also I am going to be seeing them live on their black and blue tour the date of the concert is on March 13th and I can not wait to go and see them on tour because they are the best and also I might be meeting them too but I do not know yet but I am hoping that I can go and meet them.My fave songs is Shape Of My Heart and I Promise you with everying I am and also How I feel in love you they are so sweet and I love them a lot
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I really looked foward to getting this CD, because I like the BSB music. But when I listened to it in the car, I was so disappointed in it. I can honestly say that I only like 1 song on the whole cd- Shape of my Heart. Most of the songs have the same beat and it gets old. Don't waste your money."
5,"If there were 1 million stars, thats what I'd rate it!","This album is my number 1 favorite out of every one in the world. I love ALL the songs. Unlike a lot of these ""N'STINK"" people. And Spear Britney people. BSB don't sound like girls like N'STINK do. I thought N'STINK were girls when I listed to their album. BSB are #1~I don't like some of BSB's songs, I LIKE ALL! :P"
3,WELL...READ ON,"HI!I am the biggest bsb fan, correction, I am the biggest HOWIE fan on the planet, and I about peed my pants waiting to go and get this cd. It is GREAT! BUT BUT ..it doesn't top their BEST in my opinion, the EURO Bsb cd, ""backstreet boys""..This cd is like a cd that you should have, but I don't necessarily listen to it that often.The highlights of the cd are*get another boyfriend (very fun, uptempo)*How did I fall in love w/you (well for Howie fans)*Shape of my heart*Shining StarIf I had to choose ONE bsb album I would hands down choose the euro backstreet boys cd, even though I paid [money] for it!This cd has so many FUN songs, VERY euro sounding .At least get this one???!!:)"
3,Wow.,"I am not into the pop scene as I used to be - but I actually like this CD. I give it 3 because it's not horrible, but it's not the greatest I've heard.'Shape of My Heart', 'More Than That', 'Get Another Boyfriend', 'Not For Me', 'What Makes You Different...' are definately the highlights of the CD. Those my favorite songs off of it.I personally it's the best out of the 3 albums they've released. It has more of a mix of songs then just dance/pop."
4,Pretty good!,"Well, I got the Millenium tape a while ago for my 2 year old, who wanted this one as well, and I think I've listened to this more than he has! LOL Its a nice change than some of their older songs, my son is still wearing out the Millenium tape, and mostly listens to the ""EVERYONE"" song (probably because of the repetitiveness of the word, he's even singing it!) I love the fact that their songs have nice enough content that they aren't talking about doing something nasty or deadly to someone else, so I can let him listen to the tape and not worry about him trying to get it on with another 4 year old! Wholesome and clean, I like that! Thanks"
2,nothing spectacular,"I do not particularly enjoy the musical stylings of the Backstreet Boys, I myself prefer punk rock. However being the open minded person that I am I agreed to listen to my sisters black and blue cd. I have heard their other cd's before, and I think Millenium was the best by far. BSB are now well into their twenties, they will probably never again regain the power that enabled them to once be one of the most powerful pop bands of all time.But I truly believe that Nsync, though not a horrible band will never truly soar as high as BSB."
5,AWESOME!,"Wow, Backstreet is DEFINITELY back! I have been a huge BSB fan for two years now, but I really didn't know if anything could be as great as the Millenium CD. But Black and Blue is BETTER! It shows the growth the boys have been through over the past year or so. I think it is wonderful how they are easing into the songwriting process. I absolutely love the song ""Time"", which the boys wrote about their freindship. The whole album is great, but my favorites are Time, Shining Star, How Did I Fall In Love with You, Not For Me...and the list goes on. I recommend this CD to pretty much anyone, especially pop msic fans."
3,Is it just me?!,"Is it just me or do some of the songs sound a bit like *nsync's songs? Many of the more up beat songs on this album seem to have simular beats and sounds as some of *nsync's tracks. *nsync ""revolutionized"" or started the new boy band/pop sound with their No Strings Attached album and the Backstreet Boys seem to have followed in their direction. Don't get me wrong...I think the Black and Blue album is pretty good. They have great singing talent and wonderful ballads. But the ""Boys"" keep on saying that they want to separate themselves from the other groups, and it's kinda hard when their upbeat songs sound so simular to *nsync's. maybe it's just me..."
5,Crumbles Cookies Guy,"More than enough for installing an Alpine receiver into my GMC Yukon. This install kit made it very easy to install the receiver into my truck. I did all the work myself, no snags, made the install seamless!"
2,"Yes, there was confusion at the end of the War!","I read this volume seeking a clearer understanding of conditions on the ground at the end of of WWII, the year I entered first grade.But page after page the message was garbled and confused and at the end I was wholly unsatisfied with the meager offering of F.E. Manuel.Previously I had read Manuel's ""A Portrait of Isaac Newton"" and there the author was decidedly candid regarding the subject and I learned a great deal about Newton and his authoritative grip on the Royal Society.One saving grace - its a short book!"
3,Solid and gritty,"If you are looking for a WW2 love story novel, this is not your book. What we have is a moderately detailed account of a US Intelligence officer during the final days of the war in Germany. It is admittedly not easy to follow at times but appears to be an authentic first hand account of the events. It is a quick read and continues to move along well. I recommend it."
2,"A rambling, laborious read","I purchased the book and took it with me on a trip to read at my leisure. With anticipation of diving into a great book about a subject I'm interested in I started reading. From the beginning the writing was slow to catch my imagination. I stuck with it, thinking that once I passed 40 or 50 pages the book would pick up speed and not disappoint. I was wrong. Maybe it's Manuel's writing style but it was rambling and disconnected for me. Each subsequent page became a task rather than a pleasure. It isn't intellectually lofty, or technical, but nonetheless cumbersome to read. It starts ""flat"" and stays that way for all of its 135 pages. I'm sure Mr. Manuel has better writing on display in some of his other work. ""Scenes from the End""; however, isn't one of them."
2,Not What I Expected,"I wasn't impressed with this book. I had expected something broader in scope; something more profound. Instead, I found a rambling set of reminiscences. Manuel was an intelligence officer in the XXI Corps during the closing months of the war in Europe. He provides no original insight into combat operations or how they were affected by the intelligence his unit gathered. Rather, he provides a run-on panoply of impressions and anecdotes, almost without stopping for breath, primarily gleaned from his and others' interrogations. While some are interesting, most are uninspired. This is a slim volume (some 130 pages) that becomes tedious and does little to educate the reader about this tumultuous time other than to provide some insight at the individual level into the befuddlement and desperation of Germans, soldiers and civilians alike, as their world crumbled. If your interest in this period is great, then this book is worth a few minutes. Otherwise, you ought to pass it by."
3,A good display but a few caveats...,"This is not flat screen nor does it have the the S-video hook up that some reviews have claimed. Although it has two speakers I cannot verify that it has stereo sound. Stereo is not listed with the other features on the box and is never mentioned in the instruction manual. I can say that there are no stereo AV inputs. If you have a DVD player or video game system with stereo output you'll have to settle for mono sound . Also, though there are two AV inputs there is only one video mode for both of them. That means that if you have a devices connected to each set of inputs only one can be on at a time or you'll get a distorted combined picture.I hope all that hasn't put you off the TV. Depending on your needs it may work very well for you. Personaly I only need it to display a picture. I hook my VCR and DVD to my Amp for real stereo sound."
5,Great with XBox !,"My boys use this television with their X-Box. The picture is great and the sale price was awesome. My son had been begging for a larger television to replace the 13 inch he was using. This woked out beautifully. Oh, and it had the right outlets to hook the games up to, too. All we had to do was bring it home and plug it in. There cannot be a better deal out there for the price."
3,great picture/loud sound,"This was a second tv to be used in the bedroom, but at sound level 1 or 2, it was very loud. I thought it may be my unit, but I saw others mention this...so this is not good for a bedroom tv.The picture was wonderful, so my untrained eye thought.The ""off-brand"" tv did not work with my universal remote given to me by Cox cable, so I had to use one remote for volume and one for channels...pain.Dissapointed it didn't work and I sold mine a few weeks later."
3,"Good TV, Bad Remote","My tv works fine, no problems as such, however about 5 to 6 buttons have come off from my remote. So now have to depend on universal remotes instead of original remote.Navigation in menu is also not very convenient. However, picture quality is good, actually better compared to the price paid."
2,not as good as one would hope.,I bought this thinking that it would be great for my PS2. however it wasn't very good at all. The sound was bad from the begining not to mention MONO the picture quality was poor as well. I guess for it's size and price it is ok. I returned it and decided that I could spend the extra money for a real TV.
2,Disappointing...,"After three months of use, the picture on mine is going out. There is color distortion which doesn't surprise me given the price I paid for it. I could get by with the ""mono"" sound, I could also get by with the limited video inputs, but the deterioration in picture quality over time should not be acceptable to anyone given that there are better alternatives out there at not a much higher price...."
4,Almost everything I wanted.....,I agree that the volume is loud for broadcast channels at a very LOW number. When I play DVD's however I have to turn the volume up to 15. You have to hook up the audio to the inputs just above the S-video to get any sound however. For the most part this set does what I wanted & the Price was great. Really love the remote.
3,Got This TV About 6 Months Ago...Picture is Now Going Out...,"About 4 days ago, my left side of my TV turned purple and the right side turned greenish blue. I had a couple PS2 and GCN games on top of it and have just taken them off of the TV after reading the weight problem review. Hopefully this fixes the problem, but doesn't seem to be yet...I have used this TV for many, many hours."
2,AT2002 TV Experience,"Got off to a bad start. Less than a week old, and the picture went fuzzy. Cannot fix with standard picture controls. Looks like a return for a more trusted brand. I rolled the dice, and lost! Richard G."
1,They advertised a flat screen and this is not!,The original advertisement for this said it was a flat screen TV and it is not !
1,Do NOT buy this product,"Someone said this tv has a great picture.Wrong.This has one of the worst pixelated screens I have ever seen.The sound is extremely weak too.Do NOT buy this one. I'd like to give this TV a ZERO ratingif I could. I needed a tv (of any sort) in a pinch and bought this one much to my regret. I am going to try to take it back, add about $50, and get something worth watching.One GOOD thing about this tv....it worked right out of the box."
1,Very Dated,"Reading Beker's work from 1982 reminds me of reading anything from Rudolf Bultmann's corpus - it reflects the academic assumptions of its time and place and has not worn well at all. Beker's approach is that basically he knows what Paul means to say, and rather than providing detailed exegesis, he will simple assume away works like the so-called deutero-Pauline letters (Ephesians, 2 Thessalonians) that undermine his thesis that Paul has nothing to say about the timing and the events of the parousia. Especially after so much work has been done by people like N.T. Wright on the question of what exactly the ""day of the Lord"" was that Paul was waiting for (and whether it actually came in the 1st century in the form of the Jewish war and the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD), Beker's treatment of the parousia delay is totally unconvincing at this point."
1,Avoid at all costs!,Good for scratchy pots ... a disaster for faders. Totalled out the faders on my vintage Arp Odyssey and Tapco 4400. The faders no longer move. Both pieces were never toured and kept covered. The ARP was bought new. Dielectric grease by Luberex is the choice if you have to get into your vintage faders.
5,Tao Te Ching,"In spite of the confusion caused by my cancelling another order, the book arrived on time and in perfect conditions. I received very clear contact information from the sender. I am happy with the service."
5,Simply Beautiful,"Regardless of whether or not one subscribes to the deeper meaning of what Lao Tzu is laying down, this is beautiful poetry. I find myself constantly returning to this work for inspiration and calm."
2,Good content trapped in a bad wrapping,"Not very impressed. The characters are in a weird font like it's copied with low resolution - you can see the pixels in the Chinese characters.I can't say that I'm impressed. Not at all. I opened the book when I got it, and read a bit, but because of the bad quality of the binding (they print this booklet AFTER you have ordered it). But the paper quality is good, and so is the content of the text. Though, I don't think I will ever use this book. I don't feel that this purchase was worth it at all - there must be much better versions of this out there ... somewhere, I hope.Should include pinyin transcription too!"
1,This is just Stephen Mitchell/s translation (probably copyright violation),Compare the English translation with Stephen Mitchell`s; they are identical.But nowhere does the publisher mention this fact; or claim a copyright;or mention the source of the translation. It is amazing that someonecan lift an entire book and resell it on amazon.com without anyonenoticing(??)
5,Brightest undiscovered star in the jazz universe.,"After the uncharacteristic opening track, this disc is a complete winner. Handy's playing is fluid and exciting. The supporting players are uniformly excellent and make the disc a non-stop joy to hear. Check out track #2 for a sample."
4,Better than the other books,"I read both Ann Rule's book and Summer Wind, and I found Fatal Embrace to be much better that the other two. I thought that Fatal Embrace simply presented the story without too much of the author's spin on what transpired. The authors of Fatal Embrace let the story speak for itself, for the most part, while the authors of the other two had to interject the own theories about what happened and why."
1,Boring boring boring,"From the style in which this book is written, you would think that it was authored by a computer and not two respected journalists. Instead of weaving a compelling narrative the authors spit out facts one after the other. This case was full of suspense and intrigue, two things which are entirely lacking in this work and which are vital in any true crime story (even when the reader is familiar with the facts of the case) in order to pique the reader's interest, keep them guessing, and most importantly to keep them turning the pages. A far superior account of this case is the excellent ""And Never Let Her Go"" by Ann Rule."
5,"A great author, a great book",I read this book in our school store. It was very interesting in that it took a sociolinguistic approach to many literary texts ranging from the Bible to Romeo and Juliet... great stuff!
4,great cd guys; i really enjoy it!!,"has lots of soul, some blues, really good rocking band here. i hope more people will give this band a try. this cd was recorded very well, a good mix, good original songs: what more can i say. check them out!!!"
2,Wrong Description,"Beware! The dimension on Amazon is 53 x 32 x 6 inches. However, it's actually 52 x 27.5 x 6 inches according to MDB's website. The correct dimension is shown in one of the product images though."
1,I'm shocked!,"I'm shocked that no one seems to know the truth about this book--that the author plagarized more than 100 pages of ""Hotline"" by Gina Wilkins. Yes, that's right. Copied word for word. Wilkins and the publisher of Ms. McFarland's ""work"" reached an out of court settlement, but Ms. McFarland has never apologized or admitted her crime. (Yes, crime.) DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. If you do, you are supporting someone I can only call a thief and a criminal...I encourage Amazon to remove this book from their catalogue. I'm sure they don't want a reputation for selling the works of plagarists.Shame on you, Ms. McFarland, especially in the statement on the book page thanking everyone for the support of ""your work."" Ugh."
1,A Theft is a theft,It's called stealing. The author needs to use her own creativity and talent--write her own book--instead of stealing another author's words.This is a shame. Very sad.
1,A criminal plagarised this book.,"This book was copied mostly word for word from Gina Wilken's book ""Hotline"".I also believe that the ""author"" is repeatedly writing reviews of ""her"" book on amazon.com."
1,Why is plagiarism considered okay if well done??,"It astonishes me time and again how people defend plagiarism if it stands up to some quality test. How can you appreciate an author who lifts plotlines, scenes and dialogue without any originality and imagination of her own? Worse, how can you endorse the book as a good book, when it clearly wouldn't be so if it weren't for all the lifted passages?Just because a thief is a talented thief does not make theft okay. Macfarland got a lot of credit for writing that was NOT her own, and if you think that isn't wrong, then think about how you would feel if your book had been pagiarised and the thief were getting credit for being a great writer."
5,This one knocked my socks off !,"To paraphrase the Chi-Lites, all I have to say is, ""have you seen him?"" If you have seen Marcus Benton, could you give him MY telephone number?"
4,Wireless,This scoreboard clock is really neat. The only problem being that it is electric and not battery opperated. My husband has a football room and it looks great on the wall except for the wire showing going to the outlet. He is going to cover it but it would still be much better if he only had to use batteries instead.
2,kind of disappointing,"bought this cd on the strength of the ""soulcrusher"" single. great song, heavy and not overly sing-songy here comes the pop-chorus like most ""metal"" these days (purchased by pre-teens i can only assume). sounded like Cornell had come back from the grave (the guy sounds alot like Cornell, which is a compliment, but probably too much). the rest of the album doesn't hold up. too predictable, smoothed out, overproduced, trying for radio play blandness. too many mid-tempo middle of the road songs. too bad, the guys can play. we don't need another audioslave, one was bad enough."
1,If I could it would be...Zero Stars--Pathetic,"I was in high school from 1976 to 1978 and if you had a band you imitated a famous band and scored points for your ability to do so accurately. However, you never dreamed that you would get signed to a record company for jocking a famous band. You knew better than to fool yourself with such ideas of stupidity. No band worth their salt dares to so much as sound anything like a famous band-- that is musical suicide.We already have a band like this one--they are called ""Soundgarden.""The fact that this band has a record deal is a testament to the demise of the recording industry as a whole.I listened to the thirty-second samples in haste and actually purchased this recording not realizing how completely horrible it was.Pathetic."
3,Good music,"Takented singer and musicians. Yeah, the singer sounds a lot like Chris Cornell but he hasn't done amything this good in a while. Some really good tunes on this one."
3,Too similar to Cornell's voice,"Sounds good, you can listen to the entire album without taking a single look at the watch, some guitar solos reminded me of Slash, they got powerful chorus and the music sounds solid.But the voice of Johnny Strong is too similar to Chris Cornell's voice. And that can be a serious problem for a casual listener and I'm afraid for his career too."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought the CD after hearing Soulcrusher on TV; the song was heavy and fast, and I expected the rest of the CD to be similar. However, the rest of the album takes on a much more mellow tone, slowing down to a sappy-love song pace relative to the first song. These songs are decent for what they are, but don't expect an album full of Soulcrushers."
1,Anyone want to buy my copy.,"The album comes on strong with Soulcrusher then slips below mediocre pop metal that is not even good enough for most lame alternative radio stations.There is some nice guitar work (a bit Tom Morello at times) in some of the songs but the second rate Chris Cornell impersonation is too much to get past. There isn't much original about this album, maybe a good hook here and there. These guys look like they should be pretty heavy but come out sounding like they would get out rocked by cream puffs like Hinder."
3,"Decent, but definitely nothing new","I wanted to like this album. I really did. I've been absolutely loving the revival of real rock & roll bands that's been taking place in recent years, and had hopes that Operator would be a band on par with Stone Rider, Black Stone Cherry or Endeverafter. Instead, all I'm hearing on Soulcrusher is a Soundgarden wannabe. Actually, the band seems to waffle between Soundgarden worship and what Motley Crue would sound like with Chris Cornell on vocals. I suppose vocalist Johnny Strong could have picked a worse role model than Cornell, but his imitation is so close that it takes away from what might otherwise have been a solid hard rock album.Soulcrusher is a decent enough album I suppose, and it does rock (especially the monster title track), which counts for a lot these days. It's just not anything you haven't heard before if you already own at least one Soundgarden album. To be fair though, I'd rather listen to this than Audioslave."
1,piece of crap,"This was perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting, production value, and plot were something I would have expected from high school students making an art class video. This movie was so bad that on the basis of this movie alone I have decided that there is no possible way that God could exist. The director should be ashamed of himself. He should be drug into the street and shot for unleashing unto the world a film of such epic worthlessness."
5,easy to understand,I found this book very readable. It makes complex topics easy for the normal person to understand. I am fascinated about the possibility that we may one day have physical immortality. This is the only book about telomerase (the immortality enzyme)that I can find which is easy to read and not too technical. I also enjoyed Dr. Minton's ideas on which of the competing theories about aging are most likely to be correct.
5,On the Library Journal's Best Book List of 2005,"Lots of writers have praised William Price Fox's work: Walt Kelly (the creator of Pogo), John Updike, P.G. Wodehouse, Pauline Kael, and, yes, even Bruce Springsteen (Springsteen's song, ""Darlington County"", was based on Fox's book, Dixiana Moon), Richard Yates, Michael Murphy (Golf in the Kingdom), and then some.And now the Library Journal (the number one publication for Libraries in America) has ranked Satchel Paige's America as one of the top 25 books to read in 2005.Hopefully more and more people will take notice of his great work once again. For those who have never been introduced to Fox's work, I highly recommend reading his collection of Short Stories: SOUTHERN FRIED. (Shel Silverstein wrote the music for a play based on this work of fiction.)"
5,A must-have resource for the serious Spanish student.,"I have had this book for over 5 years. I use it so much that it is now falling apart. The book is very concise and provides practical examples and indcludes references to regional differences in the Spanish language. If you are serious about learning Spanish - this book will help you quickly find the answers that you need. It is the most complete grammar reference that I have seen in a book this size. This book can be used by beginners, but it is most useful to those that have attained some level of comfort with the language and are looking for specific grammar and usage examples."
4,Mother Lode,"Spin-offs are nothing new. This book is a 'novelisation' of a French melodrama of the 1880s which was performed by 'emotional' actresses around the world on stage and film (look it up on IMDB!). It is a jolly good read too. The themes are fallen women and maternal love enduring unto death, but there's enough psychological realism and complexity given to all the characters to make them equally interesting, and the story is always rolling forward. The gritty details of the heroine's slide into hopelessness, drugs and prostitution make harrowing reading, especially as forced prostitution made bearable only by drugs is still the fate of many women today. With Jacqueline, it's ether (you drink it?). How long I wonder before some film star, looking for that defining Oscar-attention-getting emotional performance, stumbles on to 'Madame X' and gets a script-writer to work modernising it? You read it here first!"
3,Not a bad game at all!,"Unique graphics, good controls, and a solid feel. Not the best shmup platformer, but definitely a good game to enjoy."
3,Useful for beginners,"The book is well written and the ideas are easy to understand. Beginners and intermediate martial artists should read it to better understand and orient their training. Those who are more advanced or experienced should have figured these things out or they should at least reconsider their status as such.Although I almost did not find new stuff in the book to add to my training, it is reassuring to see that the things I learned during 13 years of martial arts are confirmed by true experts a co-authors.The only ""negative"" comment is that I wish it would clarify that it is aimed at novice or intermediate students."
3,Good ideas - not so good techniques,Not a bad book. it gave me lots to think about in my training.the concepts contained in the book are excellent - some of the techniques they talk about and demonstrate (in pictures) seem a bit old school. without testing them and practicing them it is all just theory anyway.got to practice this stuff.
3,timing in the fighting arts,too wordy and never really got to the point - although it has been helpful somewhat in making timing better
2,The head keeps falling off!,"I bought this just for fun, because I collect Kelly dolls.When I played with it, that toy was a BIG dissapointment! You have to squeeze the baby bottle very hard for the liquid to actually go INSIDE Kelly, since it keeps dribbling down her if you don't squeeze hard enough, and another problem: Getting the water out of her! I squeezed her tummy, but her head keeps falling off every time I do this. This is very bad if you want to potty train your kids!"
4,Kelly make a oopsie!,I like this doll. I use her as a water gun and suwirt my frends when theyare not looking.
3,Not for the kid being potty trained!,"My child received this as a gift. She's over three, so she doesn't put stuff in her mouth, but she's not very dexterous yet and so she accidently ripped the panties on the tiny doll. There are a lot of pieces, easy to lose. Keep the ""play scene"" part of the box. Haven't tried putting water in it yet, but the instructions warn that if you do it when the doll is sitting up (when most of us ""drink,"") then she'll have an ""accident."" This isn't great for the ""realism"" of pretend-play. Also, most of the pieces are just cardboard--a couple little blank books and a little rug for the toilet. Cute, but not great motivation for the potty-trainer age, more for those 5+ with younger siblings who are training."
3,great idea,"this is a great idea from Mattel...it teaches little kids how to use the bathroom, and makes it OK, because their favorite kelly doll is the one teaching them! good gift from a parent to a child."
1,Not what I was looking for,We wanted a doll to use for potty training...this was not the doll we wanted. She is hard to feed and the water trickles through her and it is not noticeable when she went potty. If you are a Kelly doll collector and just like a doll with accessories then you may like this doll better than we did.
4,Hulk is a smash!,"Here we have all six issues of the Incredible Hulk's first series. It's a fun series. It holds up pretty well, other than the commie smashing. You can see how they were struggling with how to present the Hulk in the early days. They change his color, his means of transformation, his powers and his personality all within these six issues. The hardcover format with glossy pages is an excellent presentation of this material. If you can afford it, it's a good deal. It's still cheaper than buying the original issues."
2,You get what you pay for,"The shirt looks good, is cut very tight (more than most western wear). The material clearly is average quality and ""light weight"", does not feel rugged or durable -- feels like a ""knock off"" but looks great."
5,Excellent Top Quality Product,These can be tough to find so well made. I bought several of these for my son-in-law and grandson for Christmas last year. The loved them. They are well made and of good quality material. I'd be very likely to order them again. They run very true to neck size. So measure.
4,Good medium weight flannel shirt,"Good medium weight flannel shirt, but seems a bit small. Should have ordered one size bigger since this is 100% cotton and not true to size. Stitching is great and color is really nice. Worried about shrinkage. Single guy who does his own laundry - you know what I am talking about ladies!"
5,Rawkin!,This album rocks! Like the Melvins! But heavier! And more punk!And the artwork on the interior kicks...!!!Takes me back to those wild-carefree days when I was an art student in NYC... ;)-Herb
2,Stay away from this model,The picture quality deteriorated in 2 months after I purchased it. The picture pulled in at the top and bottom (mainly the bottom)of the screen.I noticed another one with the same problem.I returned mine.Do not buy this model.
3,Product for Lights ONLY!,"I bought the unit to time my ceiling fan in the bathroom. I bought the wrong unit as this product will not work for motor type equipment. Since I don't have a sunlamp in the bathroom, I put this unit in my tool box and may never use it."
1,the watch is pathetic,"I bought this watch for a Christmas present for my son. He loved the look. But, the watch turned out to be defective. The watch would turn on at times and then would not turn off. This was immediately after opening the package for the very first time. I tried to see if it was the battery by taking it to a certified jeweler (spending money) so as to not violate the warranty in case of returning it. It turned out that the battery was full. Thus, the watch is defective. I emailed Tokyo flash and they offered no help whatsoever. THen I returned the watch to Amazon. Amazon honored the return and for that I am grateful. Another note, the jeweler offered his expert opinion as a certified watch repairer and years of experience: the inside construction is not sound or worth the money."
3,Meh.,"I'm kind of apathetic about this watch. I bought it as a gift, and the box it came in was scuffed and banged-up, and looked like it had been dropped a few too many times. Also, Amazon forgot to put in my gift card, so that was a bummer - but I can't get mad at TokyoFlash for that (I DO blame them for the box, though).The watch isn't as big or heavy as I thought it would be. Also, the lights aren't as bright as I had hoped. When I gave the watch to the intended recipient, he smiled politely and said, ""Oh. Cool."" Which about sums it up. It's cool, but it's really nothing to get too excited about. It's like the Toby Macguire of watches - it's good-looking from certain angles, but ultimately boring and forgettable."
1,Broken right out of the box,"This P.O.S. was broken right out of the box. I was so upset, I really wanted this item it is a great looking watch I should have read the other revews soooo sad Japan hum?"
1,NEVER BUY THIS WATCH!,"I got the ""Tokyo Flash - Twelve 5-9 L Version ( Silver + White LED )"" watch and lost $120. Information on Amazon is missleading, the watch is not 30 Meters Water Resistant. The manufacturer's note on the waranty turns out to be ""Showers should not be taken by this watch"".I communicated that back to Amazon, and received very disappointing responses! First bad experience with Amazon and worst of all.Conclusion is NEVER BUY THIS WATCH, never get any of the Tokyo Flash Watches, and Think twice before you get a watch from Amazon!"
1,Tokyo Diode Watch is a Flop,"Interesting look, works fine -- but very hard to figure out the time. I would not buying this watch. It was a waste of my money."
5,Really enjoyed it,"There were some hilarious moments. The one-shot-like concept was great, but the ending was a little anti-climatic.Bruce Campbell is great."
4,Nice,"This is a cool little film here. It is a under 90 minute film that takes place in real time and achieves the effect of being all one continuous take, which is impressive. To the sharp eye, I believe there are actually 2-3 cuts in the film that are well hidden and take nothing away from the enormity of the project undertaken on a small budget. Bruce Campbell turns in a good performance, Anita Barone is hot, and the film moves along in an interesting way. Fans of unique cinema and Bruce Campbell will have fun with this."
2,it's too strong,it takes off all the protectent for the dog. He got sores from this shampoo. my dog is alergic to some shampoos.
2,Can't recommend,"I have a Beagle that has had itching issues for around 5 years now. I have tried MANY different solutions. Let me repeat. I have tried a lot! Heard about this soap from reviews on this site, so I gave it a try. Did not work. It's turning out I am looking at steroids for life. Not the cure I was hoping for."
5,Duxo seborrhea shampoo,This product is great. I have been purchasing this shampoo in a smaller size from my veterinary allergist for much more. I use it on my two cocker spaniels that have skin problems. It really helps with the itching.
5,Best Dog Shampoo,I've used this shampoo on my dog with bad skin problems and bad smell! This product saved my nose and my dogs health and beauty. I continue to use it for preventative now. It also gets her fur so white. A little pricey but better than vet bills. Note: this location was actually the best price I found too! (Amazon.com)
4,Great Shamppo for the dog,"I brought my Shitsu to the groomer and the vet said to use this shampoo. The groomer raved about how well it helped the pups skin as she bathed him. They are going to use it as their medicated choice for customers. If your pup has skin alergies, use this stuff!"
2,Disappointing quality for beautiful design,"I think I bought a knock-off of a higher quality product. The design of this lamp is nice but the materials are cheap and manufacturing is poor quality. The dragonflies on the base are just painted over the luminescent globe. Some of the dragonflies are not painted thoroughly and the light shines through where paint was too thin. Lamp looks fine at a distance, but not something I want in my home."
2,Cheap Looking in Person,"I was extremely disappointed when I opened the lamp package. The ""glass"" part looks like shiny plastic and the dragonflies are painted on in a not very careful way so the base shows through. I wish I had purchased either a bean pot style mica shade lamp with a metal base or had sprung for a more expensive better looking one. I would like to send it back but another review of a similar lamp said the shipping was approx. $46.00 to return the thing. There are two pull chains which can turn on and off the 40 watt bulbs. There is also a cord switch which will turn on/off the two bulbs AND the base-but the lamp cannot be turned on with only the upper light bulbs which is a shame because the base is the disappointing part."
1,Just Doesn't Work,"The Tungsten T stylus depends upon a spring mechanism to ""dock"" the stylus into the unit as well as remove it. The problem with the iConcepts stylus is that the spring mechanism is poor quality and just doesn't work; you have to press 3,4 or 5 times to get the stylus out of the Tungsten and the same to replace it. Further, the spring tip is not threaded into the main body, but is simply held by direct contact. But the fit was loose enough in my stylus that the tip fell out several times during use. Actually this was true of all 3 styli in the pack I received; i.e. it appears to be a fundmental defect with their design and not a single sample defect. It's essentially unusable and going back."
4,Lots of Fun,"I got this for my son's 6th birthday and he loves it. The scoop lifts and lowers with a lever, and it drives forwards and backwards by touching buttons. It's a lot more fun (and bigger) than I expected. My 21 month old son loves it too. It hasn't really been tested in the sandbox yet, and after a few weeks you had to push the lever twice to make the scoop go all the way up. But it's still a lot of fun and both my boys still love playing with it."
1,Poorly Made,"I purchased this toy for my 3 year old for Christmas. My son loved this toy even though, right out of the box the sound didn't work. Now the bucket won't raise and lower anymore. This toy is very poorly made and is obviously not for children of any age. Not sure it would even last with an adult playing with it."
4,The Best Licorice Gum!,The taste of the gum goes on and on - you'd expect for it to last a few minutes and then throw it out butit lasts - your jaw will give out before the gums' flavor!
2,Not like the blackjack of old,After 2 mins of chewing all flavor is gone. In the older days you could chew it for hours and still have flavor.Black Jack Chewing Gum 20-5
3,disappointed,"Although the flavor is good, all of the packs (seven) of gum I have opened so far are stale. I couldn't find an expiration date, so I don't know how old the gum."
5,Yum,makes me feel like a newspaper boy during prohibition... :) Although I love the gum I can only eat 1 or 2 sticks a week because theres to much sugar and i dont want to get cavities..
4,books,"This is the last one in a series of endearing mystery books by Evan Marshall. I can wholeheartedly recommend these books. They are interesting, suspenseful, whimsical with an element of surprise and human touch. Once you read the first one, you cannot wait to read the next adventure of Winky's family. Very entertaining.Brigitte"
5,The best sports medicine book I have,"I'm a dancer, not an athlete. I have several books on sports and dance injuries, and this is the best I own. It is excellent for self care if you have a mild injury that is amenable to self care. (Of course, it is not a substitute for seeing a doctor in person and if I had any questions or doubts about an injury I would do so ASAP.) It is also an excellent supplement to a doctor, explaining what you need to know in detail, defining terms, and giving anatomy diagrams. It gives instructions for care immediately after the injury, before you may be able to get to a doctor. It includes illustrated instructions for rehabilitation and strengthening exercises. This book has been a great comfort to me. I get very anxious if I am in pain and don't know what is going on, and find explanations to be reassuring."
2,Misleading Title. There are better sports books.,"I had an elbow injury from weight-lifting. I bought this book at the same time I bought ""The Sports Injury Handbook"" by Levy. Prior to buying these books, I saw two sports doctors and both recommended I do some dumbbell exercises to rehabilitate. I looked through Levy's book and found not only the same exercises, but others and a better explanation than what the doctors gave me. Then I turned to the ""Sport's Medicine Bible,"" and guess what? It didn't cover it.My elbow injury is healing nicely thanks to Levy's book. As for this book, a waste of time. You would think a book with the word Bible in it would cover everything, but I found Levy's book covers more injuries and sports than this one. And I wouldn't complain as much if this book had a different title, like ""Baseball Injury Bible,"" but it's misleading when it didn't even handle my injury, which is a common injury in weight lifting."
4,Great information,This book gave me an idea of what to look for based on some common ailments. I was well informed when I went to a medical doctor to get treatment. I wish there were more exercises that target trouble spots to help with recovery.
2,IT'S A SEX MANUAL FOR KIDS!!!!!!! REALLY UPSET.,"I bought this book for my 11 year old daughter to help her cope with and understand the changes going on from the emotional point of view, hormones, mood changes and all that. I have discussed sex openly with her because I don't want her to have any misconception from what she hears at school, BUT THIS BOOK WENT TOOOOOOOOOO FAR WITH ORAL AND ANAL SEX OPENLY EXPLAINED FOR PRE-TEENS. I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!!!!! IT JUMPS FROM.... ""YOU'LL BE GROWING HAIR HERE AND THERE"" (WHICH HASN'T HAPPENED YET) TO THIS HORROR!!!!!! PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOUR PRE-TEEN, 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT IS NOT FOR THEM, UNLESS YOU WANT TO RIP OFF THE SEX CHAPTER AND KEEP IT FOR UPCOMING YEARS. They shouldn't have included that part in the book. THE REST IS FINE, VERY INFORMATIVE, VERY APPROPRIATE."
5,girls guide,Easy to read. Informative and in plain language. It helped to open communication between my daughter and me.
1,Very secular book,"Luckily I read through this book before giving it to my daughter. For the most part it was fine, but the parts about sexuality didn't bring up morals and values in any way. This was not okay with me, as I wanted something that talked about the importance of waiting for marriage and chastity in general. I ended up not giving it to my daughter."
3,surprised & disappointed,I am a God lover-Jesus following Christian & I bought the book to help my 12 year old to understand things I could not explain as easy as other things.I was very surprised when she brought me the book & said mom it says girls liking girls is ok.I looked & found it on page 103. I marked through it & wrote the right answer.Parents --- you need to read & double check the things your kids are reading -Be informed & discuss with your child what is right & what is wrong
5,a perfect christmas!,"To me, Perry Como is synonymous with Christmas, and this cd is a great collection of his holiday recordings. It features a lot of songs from his classic 1968 Christmas album (which should be on cd). The medley of carols that he does is one of the most beautiful recordings that you'll ever hear! This cd is a definite must for anybody's Christmas collection!"
5,objet d'art,"I gave this to my partner as a Christmas gift, and because of the way it was packaged, I didn't see it until he opened it. It's even more beautiful in real life than in the photos. I'll find out January 1 whether it functions as beautifully as it looks."
5,"Concise, reader-friendly, thought-provoking.. a must read!","The ABCs of Successful Leadership is an easy-to-read, thoughtful handbook filled with inspirational quotations and insights. It's a guidebook of rules to live by for success in life, and in business. Definitely a must read!"
5,"I reccomend this book for improving leadership, quickly.","The ABC's of Successful Leadership by Raymond L. Wenderlich and P.K. Daniel is a concise and to the point guidebook for improving your ability to lead your company to success. It is particularly valuable if your days (and evenings as well!) are too full of keeping up with things and you do not have time to attend a course. In a concise manner, Mr. Wenderlich and Mr. Daniel have developed a book with practical and succinct ideas for everyday use."
3,Big Swing Face,"Wow, this really is different from anything Hornsby's done in the past. And people thought Harbor Lights was a major turning point and radically different! But this is nothing anybody would expect from Bruce.I was sad to hear that there was barely any piano on this cd, but i hope the black and white will make a comeback on his next record. Although this is definitely not a classic or one of his finest works some good things appear. ""The Chill"" and ""This Too Shall Pass"" are excellent. Steve Kimock is the best guitarist to play with Bruce since Pat Metheny. I also bet all these songs would sound more familiar live.I hope in the future Bruce makes another album like Hot House. That is definitely the best studio album of his career, it blew me away! But knowing Bruce, he likes to always try something different and experiment. I can't blame him for that. I just hope it includes piano. That's what i miss the most."
3,"""A"" for Effort, ""C"" for the Result","As so many reviewers have noted, this is not a typical Bruce Hornsby album. In short, Bruce has abandoned traditional instrumentation in favor of computer-generated (or computer-distorted) sounds. The closest analogy I can think of is U2's experiment with dance/techno in the early '90s. If you only listen to Bruce for his keyboard gymnastics or his rich Americana sound, don't even bother with this disc.Surprisingly, though, ""Big Swing Face"" is not a bad album. Most of the songs have a catchy, funky quality, along with concise (and often humorous) lyrics.Unfortunately, as with early '90s U2, what gets lost in the experiment is Bruce's undeniable gift for moving anthems and haunting melodies. Instead of intimate, human insights, this music only gives the impression of a detached, cynical smirk. (The only exception is ""This Too Shall Pass."")There are plenty of hooks on this disc, but no real beauty."
1,BSF is a great album,I'm going to keep this short and to the point. It doesn't sound like any other of his albums. It sounds like a cross between Brian Eno and Bruce Hornsby.
2,WTF?,"Call me old fashioned, but I like Bruce's other work much better than this. I've listened to this disc 3 times and there is nothing good about it to me. Bruce needs to ditch the drum machines, sit down at his piano and write better music than this. How can anyone give this 5 stars? Thumbs way down! Oh well, we still have Spirit Trail and his other great albums."
4,"Quirky, cool, and fun","I can't exactly say I'm a big fan of Bruce Hornsby's. But I bought his Noisemakers CD on ebay because I knew there was some great piano work on it and I like that sort of stuff. The seller offered this CD as an add on.I think it's fun! Everyone here is so darn serious about how it isn't the ""real"" Bruce Hornsby, but I went into it with an open mind. And I liked it! Why does everything of his have to sound the same, anyhow?Be careful, though - Cartoons and Candy, just like the items mentioned in its title - is addictive!"
3,I can't figure this one out,"I like Bruce Hornsby a lot so when this came out I bought it. It doesnt ..., yet I am not especially impressed by it. My biggest problem is it all sounds very similar. I probably would not get this as a first Bruce cd but if you like him see if you canfind a used copy or burn it off someone. I still listen to it. There are a few songs that arent great but over all its notbad. I can see that some of these songs could have some great live potential. I think overall it lacks engergy"
1,Hornsby at his worst!,"I really hated this cd. I'm a big Hornsby fan and have all his music, but this is just really bad. Gone our the melodic and beautifully written songs of small town America. They've been replaced by hip hop, funk and rocking-styled music.I give Bruce credit for going out there and stretching his wings and trying something new, and that's the only reason why I gave him the one star was for the effort. Try something else."
1,"Let's not overthink this, this album stinks!","Ok, everybody, especially those with his kind of talent, should be encouraged to experiment, but pul-eeese!This should come with a disclaimer - ""WARNING: Any resemblance to a Bruce Hornsby Album is purely unintentional!"""
4,Just Listen,"A lot of you need to stop overanalyzing this CD. Listen to it and then just decide whether you like it or not, it can really be that simple."
1,CAUTION -- CD is copy protected,"I'd love to review this CD -- I purchsed it over a year ago, but I've as yet been able to play it! I can't play it on my computer at work or my DVD/CD player at home because of some new copy protection scheme.What a waste of money!"
3,A Slight Step Backward,"I have been a long time fan of Bruce Hornsby. I have seen him perform many times and have enjoyed all of his music. Now it is the year 2002 and we are given ""Big Swing Face."" After looking forward to it's release this cd is disappointing. The vibe that made such albums as ""Hot House"" and ""Spirit Trail"" so memorable is gone. Instruments are replaced by Drum Machines and the arangements of some tracks is average at best. This might sound harsh, but for a musician as talented as Hornsby, it could have been better. Overall it is a good album with solid lyrics. Some stand out tracks include the title track and of course the three which feature Steve Kimock on guitar. ""Try Anything Once"" and ""Take Out the Trash"" are also very good. If you enjoy the music of Bruce Hornsby, get this CD, but don't expect a classic, which it easily could have been."
4,Big Swing Face is great,"All you losers can listen to your old Bruce Hornsby albums and keep your ears and minds shut to anything new. This CD is so unbelievably catchy. How can you not like the song, ""The Chill""?This is a great new sound for Hornsby. I hope he keeps making new and exciting music. I look forward to a lot more complaining from you ""stick in the mud"" fans. I think you are the same people who cursed Dylan for going electric."
2,"Far from Hornsby's best, but...","This album takes Hornsby's penchant for experimentation to its illogical extreme, and is definitely not his best. My first impression was of an album full of B sides, maybe not even his best B sides. Were it his debut album I suspect it wouldn't sell a thousand copies. I think it's fair to say that this time around, Hornsby is coasting on our affections for his past works. Still, his fans are pretty loyal so I suspect he'll get away with it once without greatly damaging his reputation.All that being said, I can't believe that anyone who has listened to Hornsby for a while is the least bit surprised by this latest turn. No album he's done in the last ten years has sounded very much like the album before. So while I have big doubts about this one, I'll keep it in the CD case and hope for the best.If you're a fan, brace yourself first, then go pick it up for a couple bucks used and see what you think."
3,Jury still out,"I fully agree with the ""Wired"" reviewer -- my first instinct was to sell Big Swing Face to the used CD store. Yet I understand that sometimes records have to ""grow"" on you a bit first, and I'm hoping the energy of the title track will eventually trickle down through the whole CD, and make me a believer.Have an open mind when you plug this in. Hornsby's voice, suddenly dropped into a vortex of postmodern synthetic beats, feels uncomfortably out of alignment. And yet, most of his albums have their own flavor, and this one, a bold experiment to be sure, is no different in that respect. To appreciate this album, I think it just takes the listener some time to catch his breath."
1,the good life is ok but the rest is really hard to listen to,"list price is very high for this cd which i suspect is going to disappoint most hornsby fans. i almost couldn't believe bruce was capable of sounding this bad. oh well i'm sure it's something in a different vein he really wanted to do and i think he's certainly earned the right; so i'm not upset, just writng an honest personal review. i think the large number of used cd's already for sale probably says the most about how this cd has been received from bruce's following."
3,A notch below Harbor Lights and A Night On The Town!,"Although any Hornsby fan will love this cd as I do, it still doesn't compete with many other discs of his.There are tracks on here that are very Spirit Trail sounding, such as TRY ANYTHING ONCE which reminds us of SEE THE SAME WAY.It's a new sound that we're getting used to, but the disc is lacking the essence of Hornsby - the piano. But, there are plenty of songs on here you'll love. I recommend it! It's a new sound!"
2,Not his best,"This album was a bit of a disappointment. Not quite what I expected from Hornsby. What has happened to his great piano riffs, etc.Lyrics also leave a bit to be desired. Overall, a disappointed loyal fan. Get back to your original roots Bruce."
1,This is hard to do,"As several other reviewers have stated,I have been a big fan of BH for many years. I am in particular a fan of his keyboard work (absent on this CD) and keep praying for an instrumental/ensemble album. Beyond this, Big Swing Face is a huge dissapointment. I am all for reaching in new directions and self expression but please don't forget the basic traits that made your music great, in particular melody and musicianship. Neither appears anywhere on this CD. There is little creativity, not many melodies that you will hear even the most die hard BH fan humming, and for lack of a better adjective, weird. Perhaps this is how a young jazz student feels about Coltrane on a first listen, but the problem is subsequent listens seem to enforce first impressions. I will remain a fan and always enjoy his guest appearances on other albums from Bonnie to Lorber, but it has been some time since I was this disappointed in a CD purchase."
2,not good,"I've given this CD 4-5 complete runs through, trying to let it grow on me. It hasn't. Save your money."
1,Disappointed Fan,"I've always enjoyed Bruce Hornsby's style, so was excited to learn of this CD. I was expecting more of his signature piano style, instead, funky guitar/voice with excess profanity. If I could return this I would!"
3,"Portable Madden... the gameplay, however...","I just purchased this game. And, even though it's on a brand new system, I still kind of expected something better. I'm not at all dismayed by the graphics. After all, this is the very first Madden game for the new Nintendo DS. So, I'm pretty sure that in future installments, the graphics will get better.Gameplay, on the other hand, is another aspect. Let's just say that I came close to purchasing a new DS system after just buying it on Sunday (November 21, 2004). The throw of the ball is way too quick, and I find it hard trying to get my receiver to even dive for the touchdown.Plus, I really wish there was a feature where you can customize the controls to make the gameplay a little easier.If you must have a football game for your DS, this, for now, is the only way to go. Madden fans will love it. Others may wanna give it some thought before shelling out $40 for it."
5,Hey Growman!,"Hey Growman! This is the DS version you're supposed to be reviewing, not the PC one! Yeah, you mentioned the DS version in your review but next time use the PC review form. Jeez!"
4,Fun to Play,This is a fun game good grphics and ok sound. The only thing I don't like is you don't play in any real stadiums. This is a good buy for the sports fan in your life
1,TOUCH FOOTBALL SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IT is CoMPLETLY STUPID touching the screen to throw a ball? Running by touching is bad? I got the answer, and yes it is extremely stupid. My friend has this game and it stinks. The game doesn't respond quickly so if you are passing it to the wide reciver you will most likely see yourself get sacked over and over. It could've been good but it SSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKssssssssss.BY TEXX"
4,Esther in Medieval Garb,"This book discusses Jewish exegetes commentaries to the book of Esther focusing on how the historical settings influenced their writings. Walfish provides a context for the exegetes, giving the backgrounds of the various schools of commentary and the historical events affecting them. Well written and informative."
1,Not new as advertised,"I received the power adapter very quickly (less than a week); however it is a USED power adapter not a new one as advertised. It works okay when the computer is totally still, but when the power cord is moved even slightly, the charge is interupted. I would have given this ZERO stars if it was an option more the mere fact that it was advertised as new. I could have purchased a new one for only $5 more at another merchant."
4,"Great watch with style, only issue was the band...","This is a great watch! It keeps time very well and overall is so durable it has survived all these years of working in elementary schools and other rough on watches environments and still looks good. It tolerates the dings and scratches of life quite well, and looks adult enough you can show your Harry Potter appreciation without having to resort to wearing a neon plastic childs watch. The only issue I had over time was the band eventually became too worn and thin around the pins holding the watch to the watchband, and there were no replacement bands to fit it (because it is a Harry Potter watch.) I highly recommend this watch and suggest if you are very very active to find a way to get a second band for replacements should it ever be needed."
1,"Bad product, bad attitude","I bought a top-of-the-line version of this for my son for med but it turned out to be completely unreliable. And 9 of the 10 others in his class who had Lenovo's had the exact same experience. Only 1 was satisfied. What's worse, when we had a disagreement with Lenovo over whether we should pay for a repair that did not fix the problem, the head of Lenovo's customer service department told me -- and this is an exact quote -- ""I don't care what's good for the customer, I care what's good for Lenovo. BEWARE!"
1,same thing happened- Not sam edelman,"Just like the other reviewer said, I was sent some pair of cheap crappy plastic boots!!! I thought it was just an accident, but I have to say the entire thing was handled poorly. I was not offered an apology or replacement. In fact there was zero communication from the seller at all. Very disappointed."
3,Not what I expected,I just received the boot and was very excited- the size was great but the whole boot is for women with a heavier calf. I am regular - not thin legs.. but these boots are larger in the shaft area..so good for women with larger calf but not sure for me. It made the short zipper fold over and not so cute..they are soft and beautiful and wish thy would have worked.Thanks..from NY City
2,Lack of Tourism interest,"This video might be of interest to some people but for me as a tourist, wanting to explore Namibia not just the birdlife, wildlife and sealife, there is definately a lack of exploration on general places and place of interest shown. There is so much more to Namibia than what was shown. Namibia is a First world and Third world country in one. It offers excellenct accommodation on game farms and Getaway Lodges. It has breath taking landscapes and this was not explored enough. I found the DVD of amateur quality."
5,A delightful riddle for young readers,My children were delighted to read this book. It is wonderfully written and nicely illustrated. The riddle for each alphabet animal makes sense and entice the children to guess the name of the animal. We love this book.
5,Anatomic atlas for body imaging,"Organized into chest, abdomen, pelvis and MR angiography of the lower extremity, this book is excellent in junior residents to learn multiplanar anatomy. The MR images are T1 weighted with schematics of normal anatomy and quality is excellent. CT images are provided in the axial plane are equally good. Also covered is basic MR angiography of the chest, abdomen, and lower extremities.This book is a worthwhile investment for those considering anatomic atlases for a nominal cost. Highly recommend this book."
1,mis-print,"The book I was sent could not open as the binding faced the opening of the book! The cover looks great; so I hope that the seller will send us a ""proper"" copy."
1,Eastern Airlines Deserves Better,"Robinson's book is without a doubt the worst account of the demise of Eastern Airlines. It's value as history is only matched by Robinson's self-promotion. I suspect all the name-dropping and claims of inventing wonderful ideas that --almost-- saved Eastern are nothing more than an attempt to pave a way for his own corporate future.This book is clearly worthless, as a history of Eastern, as a study of airline failure, or even as an acceptable account of the events surrounding the end of a great airline. If you are a collector of books about commercial aviation, you might want this one on your shelf (your lowest shelf) just for grins, but if you are thinking reading this book will give you some insight into Eastern Airlines, forget it. You'd be better off reading Bernstein's ""Grounded""--only marginally better."
1,I Question if he Even Worked There,"This book tries to be an ""inside account"" of the failure of Eastern Airlines. I picked this book off the sale table and thought I would give it a try, mistake number one. The second mistake was working through 200 pages of the thing until I called uncle and gave up, the third and final mistake is that I still have it in my house - I only hope it does not effect the other books sitting close to it. This diatribe which seamed to me to be written in about 5 hours after an all night drinking binge, is undoubtedly some poor excuse to either claim ideas that were not his or maybe to push blame away from himself. Save your self the time and aggravation and pass on this book."
4,Dalai Lama Speaks,"I didn't know anything about this album when I bought it. I was hoping that this was an album of Dalai Lama chanting, but it is in fact a series of short talks on Life, Space, and Death.I still like the album, though. If you have heard Bill Laswell's treatment of William Burroughs (on Material's The Road to the Western Lands, for example) then you will be quite familiar with the style of this disc. It includes spoken word layered over a background of Laswell's guitar and keyboard and Tochinori Kondo's trumpet and electronics.This album is produced by meta productions found at metastation.com. The cd is about 35 minutes long."
3,Not what he expected,Good quality. Content was not what hubby expected but he was the one that ordered it so next time he should check some previes. LOL
2,Cited error,"Instead of writing a review I am citing an error that I observed in reading the book. On page 141, Mr. Davis states that Bob Marley had a daughter named Kimane. He had a son named Kymani, who is now a singer and recording artist."
1,This book is...,"I've bought every book in the series so far, this is by far the worst book I've ever owned. I'm tired of picking up game programming books that claim to teach game programming but they don't even create a working game. I bought this book for Linux game programming exposure and because it promised to having in-dept coverage of AI. Major areas of AI are basically defined and the only source code that is mentioned / supplied on the cd is for a template for creating a counter-strike bot. The author has a very good writing style because I was lured into reading most of the book; however, the book should actually do what it says and at least create a 2D / 3D shooter of some sort rather then just a hand full of demos. This book should have never been published on the basis that it tries to cover way too much which results in chapters that do nothing more then just cover a broad definition of the topic at hand."
1,Programming or theory discussion?,"I've never been so disappointed with a computer book purchase. This book claims to be about programming games for Linux. However, it falls woefully short of this mark. I will admit it does have some code snippets, but these are very few and extremely buggy. To top things off, the author rapidly skims over most topics in a manner that is more akin to a theoretical discussion than instructional guide. I highly recommend saving your money."
2,Lacks any real information,If you are an absolute beginner to programming games in Linux this book might be useful in that it introduces you to some of the main libraries used in Linux game programming but the book lacks any real information. Even if you read it from cover to cover you still won't know enough to make even the simplest game. The best thing you can say about this book is thay it can give you some hints about where you can really learn to do Linux game programming.
1,Don't waste your time or money,This book sucks plain and simple. Code samples are incomplete and rife with syntax errors. You can learn more by doing a Google search for a few good tutorials.
4,Milwaukee stuff,Good stuff as always from Milwaukee tool. Drills through concrete like butter using a Milwaukee rotary drill of course. You get what you pay for.
1,would be nice if amazon would ship my order,ordered on feb first-- today is feb-27 still no order--- told out of stock - but as when I ordered - amazon says it's in stock.. SO ORDER BUT DONT LOOK FOR YOUR ORDER FOR 30 - 40 DAYS( CANT SAY DONT HAVE THEM YET)
5,THESE ARE EASY TO PUT ON A CABLE. GREAT!,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT TO PROTECT A PAINT JOB FROM CABLE WEAR. SUPERIOR PRODUCT BUT ONLY IN BLACK. WISH IT CAME IN CLEAR AND A VARIETY OF COLORS. A MUST FOR THOSE WHO RESTORE OLD BIKES.
2,Bose Lifestyle 35/38,"System sounds good, but for a product that is marketed to be technologically ahead--the component connection looks like a backyard fix (they could have added a dedicated connection on the base unit) and the remote control does not work on IR (its an RF system), which means you need to run an IR emitter cable to the other components from the base unit (unless the base is very close to the other component--TV, cable box, etc.). Also, other remotes will not work with the system. I upgraded from a Bose 123 system (which uses an IR remote so it doesn't share similar problems). Overall--dissapointed."
5,Riveting,"A wonderful crime thriller that I couldn't put down. It's been years since I've said that about a book, but this one has something happening every minute. It's not only suspenseful, but often laugh-out-loud funny. The characters are well-rounded, with both tragic pasts and great senses of humor. The action takes place in New Orleans (what can be better) in the days leading up to what promises to be a major hurricane. I have read the historical novels of Ms. Dreyer's, with mixed results, and read this only because of the great reviews. They were well deserved, and I intend to look for more of her work."
1,Eh.,"Seriously, there are many more legalized substances out there that do a lot more damage than marijuana ever could. All in all, it's probably on of the safest options for a recreational drug. As long as there are human beings who want an easy way away from their problems, there will be a need for such substances as alcohol, cigarettes, (moving on to the illegal drugs) X, cocaine, LSD, acid, etc. However, marijuana (if consumed, not smoked) is much safer than any of the afore mentioned substances. I've smoked pot; I love it. It's not something I'd do on a regular basis, but it's like taking a shot or having a couple of cigarettes. If regulated, it would be perfectly fine. So what if it's somewhat harmful; there is much worse out there that is already legal. Get with the program, people."
4,A life well lived,"This women who happened to be just a pretty face shows her trasnformation into a fully grown person, capable of turning a life dangerous for the soul into a life of her own. Not in the sense of someboy just watching her own image but being able to see others in a different light, in their own real personality, beyond all pretense.Having developed an intense actoral carrier she has learned from it in the propper sense. Putting on so many different shoes isn't everybody's cup of tea, but being aware of her own inner processes she was able to see through disguise and falseness.A bit broken up at first in different episodes of her own life and observations, on a sudden sliding trip from infantile experience to adult observartion, back and forth.But with some luck and letting you guide by her you might see relations between the rememberance and the current words of observartion.If you like to learn from others in life, try it!"
2,Not everything i expected.,"i am very familiar to microscopes but this one is very painful. it does not give the sufficient ammount of light because it contains a mirror, the microscopes with lamps in them are way better. other than that the microscope is pretty good with the lenses but i wouldnt waste my money on this."
2,Pressit Steam Pressing Cloth,"This was nothing more that the late night product, SHAMWOW. It is definitely not is know as a traditional pressing cloth. Not what I expected. If you're looking for a SHAMWOW, then order this product. If you're looking for a pressing cloth, order something else."
4,awesome movie,"This is a awesome movie, was really excited to be able to get it. I've been looking for a copy for a longtime."
5,A great story,The Arrow is very well done. It is an amazing story and is staged very well with a wonderful cast.The Arrow
5,"If you like historical movies like ""Tucker"".....","..""Phar Lap"" and ""Seabiscuit"", then you'll like this movie too. I ran across this movie one day while surfing channels for something different to watch. It's a very well done mini-series movie from Canada Broadcasting. It's nearly three hours and forty-five long plus a fifty-three minute interview with comments and opinions from the actual persons involved with making of and the demise of this aircraft. Some original film footage and stills included. Lots of behind the scenes footage, comments and interviews with those involved in the movie production."
5,Red House,"This is a wonderful book down memory lane as I once lived in Marshfield. But it could be anywhere in New Enland. It's funny and poignant, historical fact, and so very interesting to read."
3,Red House...,"Humm... what to say, this book just could have been better, it was good but I thought it was more about the house the history and the transfer for each family as it came along. It seemed to me to be about the negative not the house, how sad when maybe it could have been approched in a different manor."
3,A Nice Overview for Younger Children,"This was one of many books that I purchased for our Thanksgiving Unit Study. I was unable to find information on the suggested reading audience, but I took a chance ordering it for my nine year old 4th grader. The reading content may have been a little too simplistic for her but the historical accuracy kept her interest. I believe a more appropriate audience might be kindergarten through second, maybe third grade. My four year old enjoyed it and was able to follow along without losing interest. All in all, the content itself is historically accurate, including the Pilgrim's hardships, their encounters with Native Americans, and their reliance on God."
1,Christian children's book,"This story is not only dull and simple-minded but it is also for a Christian audience. There are far too many references to Him and God and finally, Jesus, to make it appropriate for children of other beliefs. I mistakenly ordered it and have given it away but not to the children for whom it was intended. To add insult to injury, the illustrations are far from compelling. A very paltry and sectarian introduction to Thanksgiving. There must be better. If not, someone should write one!"
5,Very highly detailed airplane!!,As a WW2 buff I look for detail. This airplane has it. And I love that the box is so decorated and full of information. You also get a book inside. It's a great item for the collector.
5,Real History,"If you are one to enjoy watching real history, without all the usual critiques on this and that, narrative, these are excellent films. One ignores the sad, Nazi commentary and watches the action and the faces. It gives you the flavor of what it must have really been like, to have been there."
4,needs a bigger junction box,"I updated the look and clean-up time in some of my rooms by replacing toggle switches with these paddle switches. I couldn't believe how much work it was. The bodies of these switches are quite a bit bigger than old fashioned togglers and in the future I will replace the junction boxes as well. These are pretty easy to keep clean compared to toggle switches, but the effort required to connect the wires and shove, shove, shove them back into the boxes was remarkable."
3,"Patience, young viewers!","I saw this on the big screen at a sparsely attended $1-showing in a notoriously liberal college, and several viewers left before it was over, frustrated, confused, and perhaps even disturbed. The novelty of the all-dwarf cast will wear off quickly for almost everyone, and one must be nearly as strange as the film itself to sit through it all. That said, I'm glad I did. The others touch on Hombre, who steals the show, and I'll just mention that there's some really moving LOVE scenes in here too. There are also extended scenes of a car going around in circles, food fights, tormenting blind midgets, and a big dead sow. This movie won't let you love it, but one feels closed-minded in turning away."
1,This is 'ART'?,"I suppose this is Art, 'cinema' and not a movie, so maybe we use different standards?Even so, I found it boring, annoying, and unpleasant. The 'message' was so unsubtle that I kept looking for something else, which did not appear. How many times and for how long does one need to see someone laughing maniaically or a driverless car running in circles before one gets the point?The use of dwarves seems in this later day, with our more evolved view of sexism, racism, agism, and whatever else, to be somewhat exploitative (sizism?).I can understand the viewpoint of those who find this film wonderful, but I feel that the rave reviews should be balanced by another opinion."
2,Disappointed,"This book was very disappointing and i would not recommend others to waste money purchasing this book. The brief product description initially drew me to this book, however the characters in the book seemed a bit confused at times regarding their roles for the story. for example Alex who turns 18 in a few months, demonstrates characteristics similar to how a 14 or 15 yr old would behaves. (clingy and not at all independent of his mother) the main character Leela behaves very immature, weak and not at all like a woman who is 36. she encounters Jack's old girlfriend ""Nora"" who lies and tries to mislead Leela into believin that Jack doesnt want her. Leela jumps to conclusions without asking Jack how he really feels and believes the other woman.This book also contained a number of grammatical errors and misspelt words that could discourage someone from reading the book"
4,Hated the cover,"I was interested by the story line, that of the characters having a child (unknown to the father) together... how would he find out, how would the son take the news, etc. I hesitated to buy the book because the cover is too racy (the story isn't). I like romance but not 'explicit sex'. Couldn't read the book at work, couldn't read in front of my husband or children because of the sleazy cover. I really enjoyed the story, though, the only weak spot was the son's reaction; too non chalant for my tastes."
2,"Okay, but uninteresting","When I read the description of this book I was excited, because I enjoy reading about interracial couples (BWWM) and the twist that she had his child but he never knew drew me in. However, reading this book became tedious and quite frankly boring. The male character seemed to love the lead character, Lee, more than she did. I can't even recall her telling him if she loved him. Yes, she said it to herself and to her friend, but I can't remember if she said it to Jack. The author also did not seem to resolve Lee's issues with the loss of her parents and how it related to her relationship with Jack. I enjoyed the character of Jan and Alex more than I liked the main characters. There was only one love scene, so if you looking for passionate sex scenes this is not the book."
2,Not Quite Right,One of the joys of reading is to escape through the main character. Rendezvous cheats the reader in this way unless you are somewhat dingy to say the least. Naomi in An Infrequent Pairing by SaFiya Dalilah is much more assertive and realistic.
1,DRIVEL - THIS WOMAN DIDN'T DESERVE TO BE LOVED BY SUCH A WONDERFUL GUY,"The lead character jumps to dumba** conclusion after dumba** conclusion and messes up her own life. The male love interest, her son, even her best friend BEND OVER BACKWARDS to be generous, patient and kind to someone who does not reciprocate. She has the expectation that she can wrong others, but if they treat her the way that she treats them then life is unfair and her world crumbles.UGH...I hate this type of person. Hopefully, the author will develop a better heroine in her next novel.Yes this is a IR BW/WM novel but it's not worth the money, IMO."
2,Disappointed,"Well, what can I say, I have never read a book where I wanted to slap the heroine silly and I do not believe in hitting women being one myself. I tried real hard to be sympathetic to her, she was young,got a proposal from a man and she did not even know his last name - pleese how real is that? (maybe in the 70's love was that free?). Got pregnant at 18, death of parents, being single mum. But when the love of her life is back in her life rather than deal with problems that come up all she does is run away.1. She sees her lover with another woman and assumes its his new girl - she runs2. She jumps to conclusions about lover's intentions - she runs3. Former girlfriend of lover with malicious intent tries to break them up with bad news - she runsthis lady needed therapy badlyI had more interest in her best friend's love affair then in hers. I would love to read a book about that."
1,Whatever,happened to a good book that you could snuggle down with at the end of a hard day because you just want to unwind I have to pose this question because this isn't that book.I love a good romance book just like everyone else but I hate books where the heroine is just sooooo annoying that you want to slap some sense into her.I agree with the other comment about preferring to read a story about the best friend because this book made me want to scream which I did just to feel better.There are just some authors that have a better grasp of what I like to see in my heroines~~unfortunately this author isn't one of them.BTW I purchased the book based on the cover. The cover gives me the impression that the heroine is anything but a scared little thirty-something year old acting 'virgin' with an eighteen year old kid.
5,Great tie down with retention hooks,"I purchased these to make a suspension gym. The quality and strength are great, and the retention hooks give a little extra security. It's tough to thread the strap through the cam, but this only needs to be done once. The rubber wears off the hooks with hard use, but this isn't a problem."
2,Great lessons,This is a great book for unday School lessons. Although I thought I was getting something different. I will use it anyway.
1,Stay away from this product,"i bought this model 6 months ago. the volume now pops in and out. you are better off spending an extra 20 bucks, and getting an RCA or someother well-known company brand with stereo.this model is not worth 60 bucks. unless someone is giving you this television, because you only need one for a couple months. don't buy this."
2,"Not bad, but not great","For the money this tv is a pretty good deal, but if you want something that will last a while, sink some more money into a name brand. I've had this tv for a little over a year, and the tube is beginning to show color loss at the two top edges. Also, I have been disappointed with the sound. I know, it's not stereo (I knew that when I bought it) but I was willing to overlook that because I was strapped for cash. But the volume level is difficult to figure out, sometimes it's up to almost full volume and difficult to hear, sometimes it's down to almost lowest and it's still too loud. Also, volume level 10 - 30 or more sometimes makes no apparent difference in the actual volume.2.5 stars overall."
3,Low price...but a bit annoying,"After purchasing this TV I was pleased with it's picture and sound for the money I paid. Shortly after, however, it began making a high pitched sound that comes and goes and seems to get worse when colors become bright or intense. I haven't a clue why it does this, but it's enough to really get on your nerves. This may be a fluke...but it's enough to make me think twice about another Apex product coupled with the fact that I can't find any sort of company webpage for any sort of explanation."
4,Perfect for its price,"This is just about the least expensive 27"" TV on the market, and, if you're trying to get together a decent set of home theatre equipment without spending an arm and a leg, there's nothing better on the market.However, that does not mean that it's perfect. First of all, the edges, particularly the left and right edge, cut out sooner than is normal for TVs - on several movies I've watched, the text in the opening credits scrolls off the side.Second of all, the input channels have some bleed - don't expect to be able to use all three of the RCA channels without getting some picture distortion. That said, even if you throw down a bit of money for an A/V switch, this is a value.Also, there is a stereo version in existence, so if it's really important to you, go ahead and shop around for it. Personally, I go through a reciever, and only use the speakers for a couple very old video game systems, most of which don't even have stereo sound."
1,APEX is terrible.,"DO NOT BUY AN APEX TV. This is the WORST company I've ever had to deal with. Our TV broke 8 months in to our warranty and we are still fighting with KCPI to get it serviced 4 months later. They are incompetant and rude, and have never once called us back after promising for four months that it would be fixed. This experience outweighs the price of any Apex TV and certainly outweighs the 8 months that the TV worked."
1,"apex 27"" television","I have been looking for a new television for several weeks and when I seen the APEX 27"" TELEVISION AT2702 for a great price I looked into it a little more, It sounded to good to be true and I came to find out it was to good to be true.The picture quality is so bad on the majority of channels you can't even watch them, the background of the picture looks like it is rolling all the time, At first I thought my cable connection was bad , so I replaced that and that did not work. If anyone out there is considering buying any APEX product I would think twice about it, Like they say you live and you learn."
4,Better than average biography,"As a 6th grade teacher in a multicultural classroom, I am always searching for good multicultural literature for my students. This book is excellent because it covers some African-American leaders about whom we read or hear very little (Richard Allen and Fannie Lou Hamer). The reason I only rate it as better than average is because the biographies discuss only the positive in these peoples' characters and personalities -- never anything negative. My students need to see real people...not superhumans who never make mistakes!"
5,One of the good high speed CF readers on the market,"Just some specs missing from amazon's description:USB 2.0 CompactFlash ReaderSmall and travels with easeLED status indicator indicates when files are being transferredData transfer speeds up to 480Mb/sBackward compatible with USB 1.1Ships with removable USB 2.0 cableFeaturesDesigned for large data transfers, like images, music and videoData transfer 5 to 6 times faster than using USB 1.1Portable - weighs only 1.5 ouncesProtective cover case keeps reader pins away from external hazardsCompatible with Windows 2000/ME/XP and Mac OS X and 9.1No drivers required with most current operating systems2-year Limited Warranty"
4,fast,"This reader is very fast - compared to my usb1 and non-cardbus pcmcia compact flash readers this one is about 4x (or more) as fast. It is small and compact, the only thing I don't like is the required USB cable (though it is included) instead of a built in USB plug - just one more thing to bring with my laptop."
4,good bang for the buck,"first-i am disapointed w/amazon for not specifying "" sold each "" be careful. I had to re-order once i rec'd my first unit. Maddening ! Who buys 1 speaker ? Shame on amazon for the deception !! So i bought two for $52. Still not bad. The spec sheet is also confusing. One says 55k-20Kanother part states 75k-20K. As it turns out their 75k. ( Good bassey speakers are 45-60K.) If you pair these up w/ larger say 6-8"" 3 way units as i have, then they compliment ea.other fine. If you want these for a sm. audio system, in a bedrm or sm. office their fine. They look and sound good. Appear well made. I like the compactness. A good buy overall."
4,"Needs mods, but sound great!","I made the modifications to the capacitor as suggested in the previous review and they sound wonderful! Without it mids sound muddled and almost lifeless. I did one speaker at a time to make sure it wasn't just wishful thinking. Even had my wife swap them when I wasn't looking and I could instantly pick out the modified one. Although I just used (two 2.2uf non polarized in parallel) electrolytic caps (did add 0.1uF cap in parallel to possibly improve the higher frequencies) and resistors (two 1ohm resistors in series) that I could get at Radio Shack, cost <$10. Although you could get the same/similar parts at mailorder places for <$3, but after shipping/handling, it would be about the same. Besides, you loose the thrill of getting it done right now."
4,Good speakers for the price.,"A pair of these would run you around 45 for shipping and everything (unless the raise the price), but they're well worth it. I bought a pair for my turntables and a pair of more expensive Sony's for my computer, and honestly, they both sound the same quality. Its pretty good, a lot better than just standard speakers, thats for sure. No real crackling or hizzing going on with these, I sugguest buying the Labtec Pulse 485 subwoofer speaker set, cutting the wires of those speakers, and using them on these, and plugging them into the subwoofer. Creates a great deep sound, and its what I have done to both my computer and turntables. A lot cheaper than a stereo receiver. If you got the money, these are a good buy."
1,One star is far too generous for this mistake riddled book,"This is the worst travel companion book I've ever seen. There's hardly any information on the places listed and most is incomplete or completely wrong.For example the author lists Townsville as the 2nd largest city in Queensland. The Gold Coast and Brisbane are two cities alone which dwarf Townsville in both geographic size and population numbers. I can't really see how the author could have forgotten about at least one of these two giants unless of course he's never actually been to Australia.Most places he will say there is a hostel at ..., but totally ignore the ten or so other hostels in the same place by not listing them. Even Lonely Planet is better than this disaster. I guess the only thing it does is inspire anyone who is too lazy to do research that they can get a book published."
5,The ultimate guide to transition,"Everyone who works with students who have learning disabilities needs to own a copy of this book. It is the ultimate guide to transition - practical advise on moving the students from school to the work place or post-secondary education with real examples of transition goals and objectives for special education programs. For teachers, parents and students."
3,The least of his efforts,"I have read and enjoyed all of Richard Herman's novels. I enjoyed this one the least. Perhaps it is because he is in to writing novels which have sequels. It has gotten to the point that in this one, when he refers to a characters past deeds that he puts a footnotnote to tell you where to go to find out about the history in a prior book. Here the story is labored and contrived to weave a web of interest about oil discovery in Cuba and behind the scenes attempts to over throw the Cuban government. Clearly a new fighter pilot is on the way for further novels (Eric) and I will probably buy the next effort, hoping that the magic of prior years will return. This novel is not worth the price."
2,Not his best effort.,"I've read all and enjoyed most of Herman's novels. Of all of them, this is my least favorite. C'mon Richard...we know you can do better. Give us characters we can care about."
2,Women doing everything,"I found this one hard going. This is your basic find a lot of oil, oops it's in Cuba, better knock off Castro plot. While character motivation was believable, the characters themselves seemed shapeless. I just could not see a female CEO acting in such a ruthless manner while at same time caring for her employees. AFter a while I just closed my eyes and had a good snooze."
2,Healthy if your turtle will eat it.,"I tried many times, yet my Rio Grande Turtle would not eat this food. Also, it sinks to the bottom of the tank and is really messy."
2,"Windows, yes. Linux? No.","If you're buying this modem to use under Linux, be careful. Unless they've changed the specs since I bought it, it only works with Linux kernel 2.3 or higher. My system, Red Hat Linux 7, came with kernel 2.2. On the Windows side of my partition it works flawlessly."
2,Shopping for an unreliable modem?,"You found it!.I bought this modem about one year ago mostly because it worked under Linux,the modem worked properly for 2 months and then suddenly quit working,all i got was a ""NO DIAL TONE"" error,of course i did check all the connections but still no luck.Again about 2 weeks ago i installed it on my new home built computer running Windows XP and it worked flawlessly for an hour and then i get disconnected,now when i tried to log on to my ISP i get the NO DIAL TONE error again every time(again my phone line and cable connections are OK.).The USR.COM web site offers no help,they do not even have a driver for Windows XP available yet(Sept./2002!),so i went to Best Buy and bought this [$$$]Diamond SupraMax PCI Winmodem and i am back on the net again,my connection speed seems a bit slower(44.0 Kbps) but for a cheap Winmodem is OK.My advice(based on my own experience): stay away from U.S.Robotics,Best Data and Creative modems regardless their prices.Good luck."
2,antique equipment,"I see that the book was released in 2003, but that must either be a re-release date or simply the book took several years to be published. The equipment used is old antiques compared to today's standards. I don't mean that its not the newest Canon Mk IV or anything, its simply old enough that it talks of power winders and other accessories for old manual focus 35mm. This seems to have been written before digital was even thought of!Now, the saving grace in this book is the technique. It does have good technique which is relevant today, I simply can't get past the fact of the severely outdated equipment. Granted I have an old Canon A-1 that I play around with, but I would never use it today on a professional shoot..."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this game thinking it would be a fun high end quality dating sim game.Don't get me wrong, it's visuals and sound are good but the gameplay itself leaves a lot to be desired.The gameplay switches back and forth between predictable and non-sensical, you get put in situations where the person you're trying to hook up with has a conversation with you that ends up with you trying to make choices that could either progress the game or end it in a game over right away, making gameplay pretty frustrating.The game is interesting enough to try but I would only recommend it to someone who just wants a game to kill some time with."
1,"The pictures were pretty, but VERY BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Not worth the money and it was just mind numbing!!! Sorry to those who like the game....to each his own. I like Sims and this is not.
2,So....disappointing.,"This was one of my first three NDS games, and when I read about it and ordered it, and it finally came to my door I was loaded with anticipation and a desire to play this game. Okay, after about 20 scenes, this game makes me wanna take a nap. Not like I thought it'd be at all. Very boring to me and hopefully I can trade it off to one of my friends for a game that could be way better than this."
3,"Not the best ever, but good for a laugh.","It's not the greatest game you'll ever play but it is rather amusing, and is something nice to pick up every once in a while when you're not looking for anything hardcore.The game plays almost like a choose your own adventure book. Missions are given like : get these two on a date or make sure this person gets out of the club. Ultimately trying to hook up with your 'crush'.You control the way the story plays out, and there are alternite paths to go by. Interaction with people is purley on a multiple choice level, but it doesn't limit your interaction with characters.You can also play the game as a girl or a boy, and unlock items you recieve from friends to help you with your goals and duel screen posters of major events."
3,interesting...,I've never played a game like this before...kind of a choose your own adventure thing... It kept me interested enough to finish the game as both a guy and a girl but it has absolutly no replay value. Once youre done... there's no reason to play again.
1,"Horrible, a waste of time and money","I received this game as a gift and after two days of playing was extremely grateful that I did not spend any of my own money on it. The concept seems kind of cool at first: you want to fall in love with the main character of the opposite sex. The problem is, everything in this game is completely impossible to predict. If you pick the seemingly best responses, you don't necessarily win. I could go on about how corny and not fun this game is but apparently enough people have already said that. My main contribution to this discussion is just to remind you to never buy Sprung."
3,An okay game,"I did enjoy this game enough to solve it with both a male and a female. It is quite fun to try to use items on different people to see what will happen, like spraying them with mace. It is also interesting to see peoples' reactions when you say something shocking to them. My main complaint with this game is that although each question has multiple answers to choose from, you still aren't really making a choice. If you say the wrong thing you have to start the scene all over again. There were times I had to repeat a scene ten times or more, and that got tedious very quickly. The game does say there is more than one ending, but for the most part, you are not really choosing the outcome. I had thought the game would be more open-ended. Overall, it was interesting enough to play, but not exactly what I expected."
2,Gets Old Quick,"While Sprung has some amusing dialogue and very nice art work, the game gets tedious really fast. Essentially, it's scene dialogue and you repeat a scene over and over until you say the right things. It's fairly simplistic to figure out the right things to say and there's no real challenge to the game at all.The graphics are fairly impressive and I'm looking forward to future games for the DS that utilize the graphic interface and give me a challenging game to play."
2,Please Don't Buy Me!!!!!,"This game really blows. I bought it a few months ago with the expectation that it was some type of simulated dating game like the sims or something. Sadly, I've been terribly disappointed. The format and graphics look like something on GameBoy Color. All you do is choose responses to say to another person to win dates, prizes and other stuff. Let's just say in 30 min. you'll be yawning. Please don't waste your time/money on this one. It's a waste."
2,No.,"The word that best sums up this game is: why? It seems to me that a dating sim like this should be free on a pervert website.The game isn't totally bad, it's funny with plot twists and memory games. But don't confuse yourself, if you buy this game you have committed an act of idiocy."
2,"BORING-----No REAL choices, one path game","So disappointed that while it seems like there are some interesting choices to make the characters interact, if you pick the 'wrong' choice (according to the programmers) the scene will end and your only choice is to replay it many, many times until you find the right combination of responses to unlock your path to the next scene. So boring.... not open-ended at all. I don't even care if these people date or not, hook up or party or whatever else they're doing because I've already left this game WAY behind."
3,An adult game for the DS,"Sprung is akin to the Sims dating. It is menu driven, that means the computer gives you three choices to speak to the characters.The object of the game is flirt thru 50 dating missions on your way to score. They rate this for teens, but i feel it is an adult game.I will say this, it fills a void..since the DS dont have a version of Leisure Suit Larry ( here is the version for the PCLeisure Suit Larry Collection). I was talking to a friend of mine who is up on his computer games. He told me and I quote ""Maybe in a year or two there will a Leisure Suit Larry on DS and PSP)..well I can hopeThis one will have to do until Larry is releasedBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
3,Ok,If u r 13 or younger u should not play this game. It contains content so horrible u will be disgested. Parents do not buy this for under 13 year olds.
2,"Looks elsewhere, not worth it.","Based off of the positive feedback here, I gave this as a gift to the significant other. I am honestly very disappointed with the product.Just about the only positive about the product, is the feeling after rinsing off. It does help make you feel more clean, but not as much as the description leads you to believe.The scrub doesn't foam up at all. Literally, nothing. For the price of the item, you really need to use a very generous amount just to feel ""clean"". Definitely not worth it, when you factor in the large price. The smell isn't great either. To me, it smells just like black licorice, and for someone who doesn't like the taste, the smell isn't any better either.I purchased through Prime for Valentine's Day, so obviously it arrived on time and all of the other jazz. Amazon did great as usual, but this product just isn't worth it. I'll update the review if I can find a good substitute for it, but I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,I was expecting more...,I had high hopes for this product but it really fell short in all areas.1. It's not really a scub at all. For me i would like it to be a lot rougher and for you to notice it more.2. The smell i didnt really care for. I mean its not awful by any means but its not that great.3. The price is way to much for this product and its a pretty small bottle also.Overall i would not recommend this to anyone. There are better scubs out there for sure for a lot less money.
1,Never again,"Waste of money, will not buy again. Not enough ""scrub"", and its supposed to be odorless but has an odd lingering smell."
1,Piece of $%!#,"The product came heavily scratched and scuffed, almost as if it had been previously owned and used hard.There were numerous defects and smudges in the painting and detail work.There were globs of glue in several locations.Shame on you Diamond! You shouldn't be in business if your products are this poor!I would be mortified to give this to my nephew!I would have given it zero stars but the system wouldn't allow that."
2,The Base Is Useless,"The ship itself is fun but the way that it connects to the base is useless. The base is unstable at best and has a tendency to fall. Mine fell of the shelf it was on and broke. I would not buy this model, it was badly designed."
4,good for the job,"This is not an expensive glare filter, and I'm sure that ones for double the cost probably do more, but for the money, this filter does a great job. My home office receives a lot of ambient light, and this filter cuts down the glare nicely. The screen looks sharper and does reduce eye strain. The single lost star is because the glare screen shows some background reflection.Putting the screen on was easy, and I did need to use the velcro tabs to secure to my flat screen monitor. The monitor buttons peek out of the frame just enough to be accessible, though with a fingertip only. My monitor is an HP BenQ, older model, that I purchased used from a local student, so I cannot comment on how the glare filter would work with a newer or more expensive monitor. But I'm am satisfied with the result -- sufficiently satisfied that I bought a second one for my office computer."
1,Buyer Beware this book has errors!,This book was rushed too print too quickly. Purchased this latest version for my daughter. Very disappointed to find two math errors errors in the first section alone. In fact the very first math problem (a very simple problem) is incorrect. Given this is the first math section how many more errors are there? My daughter doesn't trust the answers which defeats the purpose of the book. Details below.Math Section 2Problem 1 No correct answer listed for f(x) =5x^2-3x where x=3. The answer key says the answer is 18!Problem 16 asks for the percentage change in the area of one side of a cube. However the solution solves for the percentage change of a length of a cube.
4,Great Album,"Great album, really surprised me as I took a chance on it. Buying their second album now! Its nice to see a band change things up a bit."
5,ISLAND ROOTS REGGAE AT ITS BEST,IF YOU CAN FIND IT BY ALL MEANS PICK IT UP JUST LISTEN TO THE MUSIC SAMPLES CLASSIC IN MY OPINION SILKY SMOOTH VOCALS AND EXCELLENT BACK UP BAND. BEST ROOTS OUTSIDE OF JAMAICA.
3,"Fine for home, not for an office.","This is a neat little printer. It is light, so it is easy to move around. It is easy to install, and really easy to operate. The print quality is also excellent for such a small printer. It takes two cartridges, a black one and a multi-colour one.The paper handlers slip neatly into the body of the printer when it is not in use, so it takes up very little desk space. And even when in use it is very neat. The paper holder is vertical, so it takes up no space behind the printer. So only the printed document tray is using up space as you print.The drawback is the speed. It is very slow, especially printing a full colour document. But there has to be some drawback when you purchase anything, and for the price this is an excellent home printer. Because it is easy to use, the kids are less likely to mess with it.If you are running an office, forget it! It is just too slow for business use."
2,Print Quality Very Poor,Prints well for the first couple of runs. Cartridge runs out quickly. Cartridge build is nothing more than a foam sponge inside - very poor design.You get what you pay for.
2,A classic razor and razor blade situation - Don't buy this,"I was sucked in by the low price of the printer but the ink cartridges will have you paying through the nose (the editorial review already mentioned this). The low productivity per ink cartridge will have you buying cartridges very often, for me it was every three or four months and with the total cost for two cartridges being around $90 without no generic cartridges available the printer was definitely not worth it.Actually, the cartridges can be refilled but there are other problems with that.The printing quality is okay but with the market for printers so large there is no reason to settle for this. Now I'm looking for a new printer and I am definitely not buying a Lexmark again."
1,Big Pain,"I concur with the previous complaints with efficiency and cost of cartridges. However, my dislike for this printer is associated with the jamming that occurs when printing a larger print file. As a previous evaluation noted, the printer jams and you end up wasting lots of paper and ink re-printing. The printer worked fine for the first few months. As the usage increases the paper feed begins to have problems with feeding paper that is aligned properly, and jams when the paper is eskew because the feeder mechanism pulls paper faster on the right than on the left, leaving a printed page crooked, if not jammed before completion.I would not recommend this printer unless you are into frustrating yourself. So long, Lexmark."
3,Dissapointed With The Quality,"The movie was a lot better after listening to a theatre critic review it.I definitely needed him to make sense of the ending.I didn't realize that it had subtitles, my fault.Also the sound and quality of the movie left alot to be desired. It could haave been a bad copy.I learned my lesson to play closer attention to the description, it was VHS. also :c"
3,Not bad but definitely room for improvement,"Back when the DS first came out, I was eagerly awaiting the release of Tiger Woods PGA Tour for the DS. When it came out soon after, I was lucky enough to get the game on sale. Sadly, it just isn't that great of a game. I can see what the developers were trying to accomplish but rubbing the touchscreen with the stylus isn't a whole lot of fun. It makes it easy to make mistakes and for some reason, I just was never able to get into it that much. Also, although those who only have a DS will probably want to wait for the 2006 version(unless you must have a golf game for the DS), the psp version of Tiger Woods is much better. Also I have had more fun with the gba version of Mario Golf and I would highly recommend that over this. Still, its not the worst game ever made and if you get it with an open mind, you can probably get some enjoyment out of it."
1,Dissappointing Magnifier,"I loved everything about this product, except the real main reason i bought it. The magnifier is a complete dissappointment!I couldn't see a thing through it. I bought it for my 85 year old father, and I know he cant see through it..."
1,Not good,it is not anything like the properganda written on the adversitement. would not recommend anyone to buy this piece of whatever
4,great,I bought this to make reading more comfortable for my grandmother and she's enjoying reading much more with its use.
2,"Great stand, cheap plastic magnifier","I wish they'd used a quality glass magnifier, instead of cheap plastic. Everything else is well put together. It still works, tho."
3,Magnifier,I have not had to use this as of yet as I bought it for my Mom who passed and was unable to try it.
1,Magnifying glass,"When I looked thru it, ithe item was blurry and not clear. I called them to get a return authorization but when I went to mail it, I was charged $8.00 to return it. I am not happy that I had to pay for a defective item."
1,discusted,I don't see how Amazon could sell this item through another store . A big waste of my money and to send it back is a waste of money A piece of junk . Will make me think twice before I buy another item from Amazon I am speaking about the Reading Magnififer W clamp and desk top base .
1,Waste of money,"This product is poor quality, especially the lens. We bought it to use for some fine point craft projects but everything is so out of focus that the magnifier is useless. This magnifier has now become just a toy for the kids and takes up space on a shelf most of the time. The base and articulating arm are of decent quality, definately higher quality than the lens."
3,Not impressed.,Not impressed with item or price. Emailed company for a refund. Never heard a word. I'll not do business with these folks again.
2,Reading Magnifier,"Timeliness: Seller shipped within promised time. Quality: The unit is simplicity itself to assemble and the weighted base would give great stability to it BUT the magnifying lens is such a cheap plastic that all images seen through it are skewed. For the price, I certainly expected a much better quality. I'll be sending this back but after the seller deducts ""handling"" of 15% plus the shipping fees, I will really be in the hole for ordering this piece of inferior ----."
2,not what i expected,I did not realize the actual magnifying screen was the flimsy film. I have been trying to return to maxi aid. I have requested a return authorization number 2 times on line with no reply back from them.
1,Misleading Product Description,"The ""Product Description"" on Amazon's product page says:""Planet Waves boxwood bridge and end pins are made from high-quality boxwood, which lasts longer than ordinary plastic bridge pins.""If this lead you to believe that these bridge pins are made from wood, you may be surprised to know that they are made from cheap, injection-molded plastic. If plastic pins is all you are looking for, I guess these aren't the worst I've ever seen. If, however, you are looking for better quality wood bridge pins, you will need to look elsewhere."
4,"Very good, but too little racing and too much mechanics","This certainly is a very good book, telling the newcomer how to prepare for races, tune a kart, maintain it, and so forth. The information provided in this area is excellent.Personally, I was hoping for a bit more basic racing information. There really is only one chapter that tells the racer how to go around turns the fastest, how to pass, and how to fight for position. This section is very short, and the descriptions there are not as clear as in the sections about mechanics. A few more illustrations would have been very helpful here.Of course the fact that I personally hoped for more racing information and less mechanics doesn't make this a bad book. Quite the contrary, actually."
4,A really good book for Kartist!!!,"I enjoyed the book. Very good advices, easy to understand and a must-have for rookies like me."
1,Sprint Karting: A Complete Beginner's Guide,I am very new to the sport but this book was very much a let down. Good information on the beginning of karting but the rest of the book is VERY out dated. Most the information could not be used today.
5,Great Birthday Party or Boredom resource book!,"I've used this book a lot! We've come up with great birthday party activities from this-- or rainy-day boredom busters. One 4-yr-old child who had just had a $400 chuck-e-cheese birthday asked if she could have her party in my back yard next year! The obstacle course suggestions alone are worth buying this book. This book will educate you to look at your recycables in a new way. After reading this-- my own ideas flourished as well. In fact, every item in your house will start to reveal it's play possibilities to you. Anyone who has watched a kid play with a cardboard box or tube for hours will appreciate this book. Some of the things we have made from recyclables and found objects have been played with more than most other toys in our house."
5,The product description above is incorrect--this book is for all ages,"Extraordinary Play is divided into chapters depending upon which materials you have handy. Got mismatched socks? There's plenty of games to enhance children's eye-hand coordination, balance and many other motor skills. Got cardboard boxes--string? paper bag? There are plenty of games for any materials and an appendix in the back telling you which games help which skills. But from a kids point of view, the games are just plain fun. As an occupational therapist who has played these games with kids in many many countries, I can promise you and yours will be grinning!Barbara Sher (author)"
5,The Story of a Girl,"Rebecca, A Maryland Farm Girl is a treasure that should become part of the school cirriculum's required readings. It teaches the children of today about the children of the 1920s-30s, a time they are unfoutunately often oblivious to. This lost knowledge, which is essential for children to understand our country and more importantly their relatives before them, is found in the wonderful tale of the experiences of a school aged girl, Rebecca, and how the world around her shapes the that girl she becomes. This is a book not to be missed! I loved it!"
4,nice toy for small child or fan,"good non-proportional control, builds up to a good speed, great detailing, though not for carpets, lots of fun"
5,no title,"Wonderful book on a simply amazing bicycle trek. Pictures were stunners. This man has biked from the polar regions to Tierra del Fuego, circumnavigated the globe, of which the journey across Russia was but a part, and biked the length of the African continent. Incredible feats, hardships and adventures."
4,Hot stuff! Electric blues for the 90's...,"This is a great CD. Chris Cain has pushed the envelope in terms of style and song structure, but has retained a gritty, bluesy and soulful content.Tough Gibson ES-335 tones, jazz inflected solos, and a hot 'n' funky band. And damn it but Chris's singing sounds uncannily like a younger BB King!Can't wait for the next recording..."
3,Good also for Macro Economists,"Apart from a very decent, crisp and entertaining read, I imagine that the model ""dominant indicator approach"" can be quite helpful to design a decision model for macro economists or other people in the business community (manufacturing, batch production etc.).The essence of this model is explained in the 2nd chapter (ca. 50 pages)."
3,"Interesting Model, but simplified","The author's premise, that military decision makers rely on key metrics as indicators for the (in)effectiveness of courses of action is interesting. However, it ignores the influence of other factors, such as public opinion, personal bias, and political influence in the decision making process.An intersting read, crisply written and enjoyable."
1,Greasy and gross,"Unsure what happened here, but this is the most disgusting shampoo I have ever used. It is oily so my hair roots appear dirty and greasy after washing. What a waste of money. Will attempt to return."
1,fake? or did not work,"I read a great deal of review and was counting big time when I purchased this shampoo.After washing my hear ( chemically treated) while drying it feels sticky and once dry, it leaves my hair dull and lifeless.I did get it at a steep discount from amazon and it leaves me wondering if I got a fake one."
4,Sham[pp,Have been using product for a few weeks - don't see much difference in my hair todate but maybe will have to use longer for better results. I don't have to use as much as regular shampoos so it will last longer.
1,Loreal Shampoo...not good,"Product is not same quality as the product purchased in hair salon. It is clearly watered down in some way....no comparison to product I purchased from my hair stylist. Thought I was saving money but not only was money not saved, but product is not the real deal."
2,"Reggae/Ska ""Spinners"" Lite","The British sure seem to love their ska - as an American while there are a handful of mildly amusing songs in the ska subgenre, we can pretty much take it or leave it.So, if you love ska - you'll probably enjoy this CD as it combines ska with light funk (and emphasis on light).There are a some CRACKING tracks like Baby Come Back, Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys & Butterfly Red White & Blue that wouldn't be out of place on a Philly or Memphis sound collection of the 1960's or early 1970's but the rest of the CD is pretty much ska-light funk which to American ears just sound like weak non-descript funk. Perhaps the best description is they sound like The Spinners minus the funk, soul and catchy songs ... if that sounds like faint praise ... it is.So, the three songs listed above are worth hearing - perhaps on a single disc collection but the rest really depends on how much you like ska & light funk. At 40 tracks, there's way too much American filler."
3,Django/Django Strikes Again,I give the fist movie 3 stars (Django). The other disk...... throw it away I give that movie -3 stars for wasting 90 min. of my life. Buy the vesion that only has Django.
1,Horrible for the beginner,"I have used this book at a college level and do not recommend it. The book is not clearly written and does not seem to follow a logical order. Unreferenced symbols are used in formulas throughout the book. Often, out of the blue, a statement such as a=xyz is made. In order to find out what a is, the user has to has to turn backward several chapters. All too frequently in derivations, a formula is referenced that is ahead in the text, or in a future chapter. Notation is also confusing in terms of symbol choice. For example, 'r' with a dot on top of it is used to denote the radial component of a position vector change. The reader is admonished to not confuse this with the velocity when a simple subscript could have sufficed.I think this book is useful as a reference for someone who is already very familiar with the subject and does not need to understand how any of the equations are derived (because he/she already does.) And who perhaps needs algorithms for calculation."
3,"basic textbook, informative but dry","Moise's book glosses quickly over ancient China and focuses mainly on China in the 20th century. Although his facts are good this is a fairly dry read--something you might keep around for a quick reference but not something to read for fun. Although it is often used for a textbook in Chinese history classes, there are other far more readable histories available. If it is ancient China you want try Fairbanks, for better modern China history try Jonathan Spence."
4,cute illustrations & lovely message about differences,"This is a cute story about seeing the world through your own unique eyes. The illustrations are well done and the story is really positive, but it isn't 'fun' to read over and over because of the wording."
5,FRANKY PEREZ IS JUST GETTING STARTED,"For those of us who work, there is little time left in the day to listen to music. I'd love nothing more than to sit home and write reviews.This album rocks!!! You can't go wrong. Lots of tracks, creative and refreshing. Nothing fake. This is not a fake review."
4,"Nothing you haven't heard before, but oh, so worth it...","My wife kept telling me about this ""Latin John Mellencamp"" she saw on TV a few weeks ago, and then I finally saw the ""Something Crazy"" video. I dug it, so when I saw the CD on sale, I figured it was worth the investment. I was pleasantly surprised; nobody ever puts 19 songs on a disc, and even if they do sound the same, it's still a good thing. Simple, jangly guitar melodies, an easy, sing along voice... it's well worth a listen. John Mellencamp is the best comparison I can give. ""Cecilia"" might be the best track on the album, although there aren't too many tracks you'll skip. Thumbs up, Franky."
5,I can't stop dancing!!,"This CD is a must buy! Not only in the single, Something Crazy, a great song. But this CD is one you find you enjoy every single track!! All 18 tracks!! Go FRANKY!!"
5,"A real musician, a great Entertainer , an Amazing voice.","Franky Perez is one of a kind! He's talented and his lyrics are touching and deep. And I'm hooked.. I cannot seem to take it off repeat. He goes from rock, to Cuban sounds to soft and mild. His voice is strong and smooth!A must for all the music lovers, I saw him Live and he is also a great entertainer. One of the best songs is "" Something Crazy"". Also the last song""America you are Part Of Me which Amazon forgot to include with the track list is a moving song in honor of our country and being an American. Definitely one of the best CD of the year. Two thumbs up!"
1,I'm sure it's a good product when it actually works...,"I bought this for my boyfriend recently because he really wants to copy his LPs to our computer to make mix cds. He still can't get the pre-amp to work, so he tried calling support - they kept him on hold and then told him that that they cannot help him until he registers the product. There is no online product registration, you have to do it by regular mail. The documentation TOTALLY (...), as does the online ""help"" files. Hopefully when they get his registration we can get some technical help. I wish I hadn't bought this product, but it was the only thing I could find to copy LPs."
1,POISION,"Toxic smelling! DO NOT EAT!!! Amazon will issue a prompt refund if it is bad, but do not attempt this product. They are very very rancid and smell of fumes and plastic. WILL MAKE YOU SICK!"
1,Absolutely awful,These crackers smell and taste like sewage. The boxes I received had expired two years ago. And get this - they are not kosher for passover? Took a fantastic passover product name and repackaged it into the worst tasting cracker I have ever had the misfortune of putting in my mouth.
1,worst tasting cracker ever,"how anyone could think these crackers are even edible is beyond me! There is absolutely no flavor to the cracker as you are eating it and worse yet, there is a horrible sour after taste."
1,Stale and A Year and a Half Old!!,"How could Amazon ship a product that was rancid and smelled horrible? If someone in my family would have eaten this, they would have gotten sick- was this product so cheap because it was old and beyond stale?"
1,Horrible,"Rancid, metal tasting. I have come to appreciate MANISCHEWITZ . But these crackers are vile. I liyerally had to eat some bread to get the taste out of my mouth...yeech"
1,Expired nearly a year ago,I ordered these same crackers from the warehouse deals section last month. They were rancid and expired nearly a year ago. I held off reviewing them because I was pleased with how fast Amazon issued a refund. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Everyone is entitled to make a mistake. It wasn't until I noticed these very same crackers still listed that I felt compelled to warn anyone considering purchasing them to save their money. I'm very shocked and disappointed with Amazon for continuing to sell them when they were made aware by several people that they are expired.
5,"Excellent Transcription, works very well","This arrangement of the Art of the Fugue for String Quartet brings a different sound, different approach to this favorite. Of particular interest are the excellent notes concerning the history of the Art of the Fugue, and why the arrangement for String Quartet can in one way be quite authentic.Even though this is certainly different sounding from what one normally hears, I really enjoy this and would highly recommend to others. The playing by the Portland String Quartet is superb."
5,"A fantasic lesson for living, lovingand leading.","Phil's mother stopped by the bank and I purchased the book. I come home that evening and could not put it down until I had read the entire book. I would cry at one moment and laugh the other. Joe VanHooser and my Dad had simliar ideas and as I read this book I reflected back to my own childhood. Thank you Phil for reminding me how fortunate I was to grow up in a rural community. Perhaps if more Dad's read this book and provided the type of influence Joe had on his family, our country would experience less violence etc as we do today."
1,Not Happy,"I bought these for my wife's car thinking I could improve over the original headlamps, well that didn't happen and within one week I'm replacing these with another set (Sylvania's). The first set came in and one of the bulbs didn't work, I called customer service and they sent a replacement, they both worked this time but the wife wasn't happy, she couldn't see any better and maybe worse cause of the way the light beam was!?! The packaging had no details like what you see on the web page, it was just a clear box with bulbs not even sealed. I wouldn't buy this product again."
3,was not what I expected,"I gave this 3 stars but it was difficult to rate. I left the bulbs in my truck for about 1 hour before removing them. They just did not put off enough light. I felt like I was driving with my lights off. This was on my 06 Nissan Xterra and I am comparing them to my stock lights. I wrote the seller and they immediately sent me new lights, which was great (A seller) but they performed the same. I matched up the wattage, etc but perhaps if I had purchased higher wattage bulbs, they would have performed better. All in all, maybe they perform like they are supposed to but they just weren't right for me."
3,Queen + Beach Boys,This album gets better with each listen. Great production by Gary Usher. Highly recommended over the Sagittarius project. Tumbling Tumbleweeds almost sounds Byrdish with lap steel guitar parts... California pop - go get it. Track two sounds like a missing track from Todd Rundgren's Something?Anything? The second half of the cd is an instrumental reprise of the 1st half and makes this cd worth checking out.
4,I met these cats at the Tea Party in BK a few years ago...,"...and all I have to say is ""Sheer Dopeness"". I was impressed with their stage performance then and I'm sure it's been enhanced so much more. The samples provided here for listening are hot enough to make a real Hip Hop fan wanna purchase this product. Keep 'em coming y'all!!!"
3,fun but chinsy,"I bought this tractor/trailer set for my twin 1 year old boys. They loved it as did my husband and I for about a week. The tractor started to only vibrate when it feels like it, one side of the wagon fell off, and the steering wheel broke off, and we've only had it for 2 weeks. It's a nice but I think a ver CHEAP made toy. I bought it when it was around [...] dollars and I wouldn't have paid any more for it."
3,Okay toy,"I bought this toy for my 17-mo. son, who loves tractors and farm animals. I had 4 main problems with the toy: (1)the vibration option scared my son (who is usually quite fearless); (2) the sound quality was poor and extremely loud; (3) there was no way to turn off the sounds and vibration; and (4) the animals kept falling out of the wagon, which only had two side rails and lacked means to hold the animals in place. The tractor and wagon were made of hard, brittle plastic and felt a bit cheap. I returned this toy and bought Learning Curve's John Deere Animal Sounds Hay Ride, which I like much better."
5,Grandsons love this toy,"This is a durable toy that my 3 year old and l year old grandsons enjoy. Definitely a favorite at ""Nona's house""."
5,Intimate Intentions,I'm addicted to Angie Daniel's writing. Once I started reading this novel I could not stop until the ending. I love the srong male presented and the strong woman. An enjoyable read that connected each character to someone in your life. Very erotic storyline. Highly recommended reading.
4,Kids like it more than I thought they would,"I bought this product originally for a play center for my daycare. We were learning about forest animals and I needed toy binoculars to have the kids pretend play with. These were inexpensive and for the price I have to say I'm pleased. Even after the center was no longer, my sons still play with these during there own imaginative play. For the price they are VERY durable too. Just beware of the string around younger children as they pose as a strangling hazard."
3,Leather Pouch,"The pouch itself is good, but with a clip it becomes twice thicker, what is not obvious from a picture. A rear view could help really to assess what you'll get."
2,Pass on this one,"This case is basically okay, but the major problem is that it swivels constantly. This problem can cause the phone to be upside down and after wear the snap come loose and the phone can fall out. Basically there are better cases out there."
3,It is interesting...,"although the story also took idea from Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde (There are a lot of story about alter ego today, famous example is Hulk). If people say it is 'hijacking' Samurai X popularity, yes indeed, but the story & plot are different each other (Same thing happens to a new anime, called Rahxephon, even though Rahxephon's genre is resembling Gundam). If you have spare time, you can go ahead, otherwise, do not waste your time with this manga. Anyway, it is just my opinion."
1,bad,"Beware of unoriginal story, so and so art, plus boring characters. Could be better...I don't see how it got such highly rated reviews. If this was to be your first manga experience, look elsewhere."
2,Ugh--could this rip off any more from Rurouni Kenshin?,"First off, I have read Samurai Deeper Kyo and Rurouni Kenshin. So for those of you that want to flame me, I do know what I am talking about.I was not very impressed with this book. The characters are sterotypes, the plot has been done before (Kenshin) and the dialogue was, while good, not enough to separate it from the pack.Overall, I prefer Rurouni Kenshin to this."
3,Nice case...,I needed a case for my MP3 player and this one worked good and it protects my MP3 player from any dents and damages.
3,good mp3,"I bought this mp3 because it was cheap and light and support chinese.Since it's such a small and light mp3 with too many functions, sometimes it's just too much trouble when i want to skip to the next song or increase the volume. If I want to change the volume, I have to press the hot key button to go to the volume mode, then press up or down. If I want to go to the next track, I have to press the hot key button again to switch to the track mode, then press up or down for songs.Also, it starts up pretty slow compare to other mp3 players I had, it takes around 15 seconds to start the mp3.In addition, sometimes I played a song half way through and I turned the power off, when I turned the power back on, the song wasn't start on where I stopped, but start from the beginning of the song again. It's not really a big problem for me, because most songs are only 4 mintues long. But if you intend to listen to something really long, it might be a problem."
4,Joan Morris makes the most of Kern,"Joan Morris is a mezzo-soprano who has recorded a number of albums accompanied by her husband, composer and pianist William Bolcom. She has a lovely voice, and sings the old Tin Pan Alley and similar genre songs straight in the way they were written, without a lot of jazz embellishment. (Not that jazz embellishment is bad, it just doesn't always work with this material.) I'm a big fan of hers, so my opinions may be a little biased; but if you love this music it's hard to not enjoy Morris singing it.Kern is not as well remembered as some of his contemporaries, and this album reveals some of the reasons why. At his best, with songs like ""Look for the Silver Lining"", ""Long Ago"", ""You Couldn't be Cuter"", and ""All the Things You Are"", he should never be forgotten. But some of his other work is not as memorable. This album is worth the purchase for the winners, but not every track is a winner."
3,So so,"this book had a really good plot and romance scenes,but its so easy to getconfused with all of the names and realtion they have to each other."
4,Well worth the wait.,"Samantha Fox has come back after a lengthy hiatus since JUST ONE NIGHT in 1991. More importantly, she has come back strong. She co-wrote almost every song on the album and her strength as a songwriter shows. The album is a wonderful collection of dance tracks, but best of all they diverse from the London club sound of ""Deeper""; the Latin rhythms of ""Perhaps""; and the American pop sound of ""Let Me Be Free."" She has come a long way since ""Touch Me"" in 1986. She's matured, her subject matter is stronger and she's taking more creative control of her work. She's in fine voice in fine songs. If you're a fan, you'll love it. If you're not, this is the album that will convert you."
5,SAMANTHA FOX ROCKS AGAIN!,"SAMANTHA FOX ROCKS AGAIN ON HER NEW 21st CENTURY FOX CD. IF YOU HAVE NEVER LISTENED TO SAMANTHA FOX BEFORE YOU HAVE MISSED A LOT. THIS NEW CD IS HER BEST SO FAR AND NEW AND OLD FANS WILL LOVE IT. SHE HAS WROTE MOST OF THE SONGS ON THIS CD PROVING HER TALENT AS A SONG WRITER. SAMANTHA HAS DONE WONDERFUL WITH HER VOCAL TALENT ON THIS CD. MY FAVORITE SONGS INCLUDE; JUST A DREAM,THE REASON IS YOU, DEEPER, LOVE MAKES YOU AND THE SINGLE; LET ME BE FREE. ON THE SONG ""LOVE MAKES YOU"" SHE DOES HER BEST VOCAL PERFORMANCE EVER. THIS CD HAS A GREAT POP ROCK DANCE TOUCH. BUY THIS CD AND YOU WILL KNOW WHY SAMANTHA FOX HAS SO MANY LOYAL FANS. THE FOX ROCKS!"
2,Naughty Girl!,"The cd is much like other Samantha Fox cds in that it is disposable fun that really doesn't make a huge impact either way. The exception on the cd is the song ""I Dream In Colours"" which is easily one of the worst things ever written. The song is a all-out assault on the senses and if Sam had only decided to drop it from the line-up, this cd would have gotten a 3-star review..."
1,Painful to the ears,"Based on the high praise on Amazon I picked up this latest effort by MS. fox. and I'm sorry i did. The album is already out of print which speaks volumes on it's own. There is nothing here but laughable forgetable dance ditties. Ms. Fox while a good entertainer lost steam with the release of her third album ""I wanna have some fun"" which ketp her going due to the re-make of some songs. By the fourth album she was dead in the water. Like it or not Ms. Fox will always be remembered for her revealing appearance and her two best known songs, ""touch me"" and ""Naughty Girls."" It is rumored on her web site she is planning a new album for 2004. I hope it will be better then this fluff. I will certainly listen to it well before buying if indeed it does materialize."
4,intense,"This is intense , experimental , progressive music with high levels of musicianship . It is not like Frank Zappa , but I think Frank would have approved ."
3,Old Time Patience,I was pretty excited to find this magazine online and wanted to subscribe until I read ALLOW 12-16 weeks for delivery. Columbus could have delivered the magazine sooner.
5,A Must for Old Houses,"Great DIY projects on a budget, and I love the photos! For more photos of old houses, their website[...] features most of their home tours."
1,Never got it!!!!,"I ordered this on January 31st and here it is, March 19th and I've never received an issue. I understand that it takes time to process, but sheesh! I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED in the quality of the service."
2,Series is getting as old and tired as Sister Mary Helen,"This latest Sister Mary Helen is pretty much a rehash of all of the preceding ones...and you can figure out who the murderer is very quickly...a fast read, but a disappointing one as well!"
1,Deliberate white band long before toner is used up,"Beware this Lexmark ""high-yield"" toner cartridge. A deliberate white band appears on all pages long before the toner itself is exhausted. The white band -- a uniform area where no toner is deposited -- is about 1/8 of an inch wide and appears about 3/4 of an inch from the right side of an 8-1/2 x 11 letter-size page. The band is obviously deliberate (uniform location and width; sharp edges; no toner deposited at all; band appears after about 5000 pages have been printed). Once the band appears, the cartridge is only useful for printing documents with large (1-inch) margins. (Note: I checked my laser printer carefully -- including installing a different cartridge -- to rule out the printer as the source of the problem.)"
1,What a Joke,"If your idea of a ""highlight"" is to see runners crossing the finish line with their arms in the air, swimmers hugging after their race or athletes standing on the podium waiting to receive their medals then this DVD is for you. If you are looking for something a little more substantial....like actually seeing the race (or event) you will be very disappointed."
2,bad idea,"Trying to compress many hundred hours of Olympic events into a 2 hour DVD is a foolish project. The main program on the DVD is a long music video, showing a few seconds each from many different events. That is barely worth watching, but the special features are a little more interesting. The special features do show a couple of dozen short events in their entirety, including all the Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt world record events.The fantastic Olympic opening ceremonies are not included on this DVD, but there is a separate 3 hour DVD set for the ceremonies. That set is much more interesting than this one."
1,not worth it,This was not what I thought I was getting; a very short DVD. Not worth purchasing. Save your money and buy a different one or go on youtube and find much more then was on this DVD.
3,Follows the politically-correct party line,"He is so afraid of losing research grants or otherwise hurting his career. He repeatedly states that differences in human intelligence and behavior are almost entirely due to environmental influences and that almost nothing is due to genes. The party line in the USA is that people of all races and sexes have exactly equal potential at the moment of conception, and that all differences in outcome are due to environment; this lecturer knows that he dare not stray from that faith, regardless of evidence to the contrary."
4,Good Introduction for Young Engineers,"I have been in this industry for more than six years before I received this book at an ASCE seminar. The book is an asset that I plan to use in training fresh out of school engineer due to the broad and general information. Every project is different and local complexities always come into play so it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to write a book that would substitute for experience in a given market."
3,"Good product, misleading description","Like a lot of the guys (note the recent reviews), I was duped into thinking that this was the perfect case for my recently purchased NX80. Of course, I get the stuff, excited, extricate the case and try to pop my NX80 into it. It won't close. So I looked at it carefully and it was thinner and longer than the NX80. This only works for NX60/70 models.Needless to say, a warning should be placed on the product page to note that this doesn't fit the new NX73/80 models."
2,Not mad for all NX Series,"I wish I had read the first review before buying this. I also bought it for my PEG-NX80V/U and didn't realize that it doesn't fit until I had already opened it. It does appear to be a well made case, I only wish it was made for for the NX80"
5,Back in the Day,"This is a great item, It was the one I used 40 years ago when I was in the scouts. Vendor was efficient and prompt."
2,Who cares?,"These guys are the saviors of rock? How? Why them? I hear nothing remotley special going on. perhaps seeing them live would change my tune. They do dress snazzy though. But, who cares?"
4,Noo Yee-ork Rawk Lite (TM),"The Strokes sound may be retro but is no way just a pale imitation of previous greats. This stuff deserves to be considered up there with the best. Sure, they've borrowed sounds, but the ideas sound fresh and 'now' as ever. No one else is making this racket in rockdom at the moment - they have arrived on the airwaves like a breath of fresh nicotine and coffee straight from penthouse apartments and the streets of New York.Their ideas and vocal tunes are excellent; the vocals themselves are a lazy, laid-back drawl. If you like the NYC sound of bands such as the Velvets, but moreover Blondie, then this is for you. A fun, soundtrack to your night out. However, they are lighter than I thought they would be, hence my inclusion of Blondie above. Iggy Pop and his nasty Stooges would stomp these middle class brats if their records are played back to back. A warning to DJs or rabid compilation makers, perhaps?"
1,mediocre and tame sounding release,"I am disappointed by this release. Obviously they have their friends that have gone to site to give the good reviews but I was very let down when I purchase and listen to this release - I love the Dolls, Stooges, Velvet Underground but it is insulting to these great rock bands to have this comparison with this band - this is truly average and mediocre modern attemps to recreate glory days of rock'n'roll past. JG"
4,Funktabulous,"Funky and light hearted, Arepa 3000 is a fun album.If you like funk (Jamiroquai, Gap Band, Stevie, Parliament, etc) and latin sounds, this a enjoyable album. [...]I think Arepa is just as good as their previous album. ""Masterbation Session"" and ""Mujer Polcia"" are two of my fav tracks. Great 70's style funk guitar playing with dance beats.Jamiroquai used to be my favorite modern funk outfit, but they've been replaced by Amigos Invisibles. Amigos have that raw funk quaility that feels spontaneous, which Jamiroquai has lost IMO since Traveling Without Moving."
4,Third album of the greatest venezuelan dance band!,"This is not the best album this band has to offer but its a nice album full of disco sounds mixed with jazzy grooves and latin percussions (venezuelan). Theyre sound is a litle more mature doe!My favorite Amigos Invisibles album will always be their first ""A venezuelan typical and autoctonal dance band"" (not available in the States), lets hope their forth album ""Venezuela singasong"" is better than this one."
3,it like a dress ...,it like other said it truly like a dress n i m 6'1. other then that its about the same thing to every other one.
2,LOOOOOOONG,"Yeah. I ordered these from Macy's. Unlike the 2007 model, the CK tank is now ribbed. Still, it's an okay tank. However, it is very very very long. I'm built exactly like Tom Cruise. Same height too. These fit me like a dress. I'm returning them."
2,To short,"I wasn't to impressed by these for the price. They shrunk way to much length wise and are way to big girth wise. Just an akward fit, overpriced, not worth it. Again, way to short."
4,Great for Hidden Warmth,These tank tops offer a layer of extra warmth while remaining sheer enough for looks and long enough to tuck into low rise jeans. Expect some shrinking or fading if you use a dryer instead of rack or hang drying.
3,Shrinks a lot!,"I bought the medium size and returned them thinking they were too big. However, after I washed the small's, they shrunk too much and now they're too small. Buy the size you normally would and don't make a judgement until you wash them."
2,Does not work on Zire 72,"It is just for the small monochrome Zire on the picture, I am sure it does not work on Zire 71 either."
1,"So bad, not even rated",Brighthand conducted a test of popular screen protectors and this product didn't even make the top five list. How good can it be.
5,FANTASTIC ROCK ALBUM!!,"IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!! GHOST OF LOVE IS PURE MAGIC. AND ANNICA AND HANNU ARE AMAZING SINGERS...ESPECIALLY ON HEARTS ON PAROLE. THIS IS TRULY A GREAT RECORD!! OH YEAH, JARTSE'S NOT BAD EITHER!!! HAHAHAHA!!"
5,Access Denied,"Lewis's second release also sold as a Liberators CD in some places.This is a little more rock than 'More Purple...' and contains a Girl and Faster Pussycat track in addition to tracks from More Purple and LAG tracks.If you liked 'More Purple', Girl OR LA GUNS try this one. LAG tracks are better than the LAG recent remakes."
3,Disappointing,"I love magical realism, but when it doesn't work, it's like bad comedy. Ugh. I didn't find this world or its characters quite believeable, in part because the book seemed romanticized. For example, despite all the ""terrible"" plagues that beset our heroic family, in the end...not so much (avoiding spoilers here.)I also felt that the book cried out for some tough editing. Took forever to get started, and wasted enormous amounts of time on details of little interest, while ignoring some important aspects that could have brought this world to life. (For example, though this is a novel about a family and there are numerous references to the children in the household, none of them are ever individualized. We get a better sense of who the dogs are!)"
3,good read,"Cellophane was a well written book with a load of esoteric information on life in the rain forest. Characters were diverse and quirky, with the tension between locals and interlopers maintained over decades."
2,"good, after 129 pages","Yes, it really takes 129 pages to get into this book. Very very difficult beginning, the only reason I hung in was that a friend had read it and told me it took 129 pages to get into it. Actually, from 129 to the end, it was good. But I wouldn't recommend it because of the slow start. I can handle slow starts, but this was ridiculous. And I read that this author is an editor, so that amazed me that the start took so long. I read the glowing review in People, and I really would have liked to be warned that it was hard to get into. I would have given up, if not for the friend above."
5,Soft place in my heart for Renaissance Music,"I thoroughly enjoyed this CD. I love music from the Renaissance, and this performance did not disappoint me. It is very lively and strong performance. I felt the instrumentalists had their heart into the music which kept my ear throughout."
3,All in the name,CD is missin something... maybe you shouldnt have your rap name after your little guys name. you know... your pen--.
3,delivery problems,"I love the product and would give it 5 stars; however, I ordered a set of 2 and only received one. My sister ordered a set of 2 last month and also only received one and had to send it back. I have left a message and emailed the company today, so hopefully I can get my second one sent to me soon."
5,Actually VERY Good,"Well-written, well-selected, and often very funny. The entries do a good job pinpointing the appeal of their respective cultural oddities, and the array is pretty dazzling. Heavily weighted toward the generation that came of age in the eighties, but hey, where else can you go for so much guilt in one place? Our colleges should consider giving it to foreign graduate students on their way through customs--it's a guide to all that's 'essentially useless', the hidden flotsam and jetsam of our culture.I got this as an 'extra' gift from a friend, and expected to find it moderately amusing, something to thumb through. Surprise: My partner and I were so impressed with the book that we both wound-up reading through the entire thing."
5,"Unique, superbly written, and very highly recommended","Celeste Messer's The Adventures Of Andi O'malley is a five volume series of chapter books for young readers where the stories showcase the concept that by doing a good deed for one person, that person will then do a good deed for another, and so on. Andi O'Malley, her family and friends, the eccentric Miss Bluebonnet, Jelly Roll (Andi's guardian angel), and an assortment of other angels and villains will both entertain and inform boys and girls on handling sensitive issues all children will eventual face in real live. The individual titles composing this unique, superbly written, and very highly recommended series include: Angel Experiment J134 (0970217102); The Broken Wing (0970217110); The Gift (0970217137); The Circle Of Light (0970217129); and last but not least, Three Miracles (0970217145)."
5,Excellent Video,"I first saw this on TV twenty years ago and loved it then. I bought a video copy of it back then but it was stuck in storage when I wanted to use it for a class I was teaching. The video was excellent, held the kids attention when they started recognizing the stars, most of whom are still active. The message is meaningful and leads to great conversations about the work that is still needed. Recycling isn't enough, so many people do it and considered that the end of what is needed, the video tells about other issues. It was well produced and directed and is still viable in today's world."
2,missing parts to the lamp,"I purchased this lamp 3 months ago and did not put it together as it was a wedding gift for my daughter . When they received the gift and put together the lamp, they were very disappointed to see it was missing 2 parts. The information supplied left no 800 number or contact info to get these parts. We would like to get the replacement parts to the lamp. This is in regards to transaction #527038."
5,Once again an excellent teaching aid!,"Very nice job on the Bung Bu DVD! The DVDs are a very high quality production. The best I have ever seen.Sifu Wes Hardy's explanations were very clear and Sean Daily's performance of the form was excellent!I will definitely be recommending this video to all my students.Richard A.

1,"Only for e310, e340 & e740. Too small for e755","The product title is misleading. The screen protector only fits e310, e340 and e740. It is too small for e755."
1,Inaccurate description on Amazon,"The title states ""...Toshiba e300/700 series."" This is untrue.These don't fit the E750/E755.You want to buy PA1322U for a screen protector for theE750/755. Be careful in your selection of return optionsto Amazon to ensure that you are not charged for returnshipping."
4,Strange edition,"The music on this album is quite good and challenging.What was rather surprising is the edition itself, turning out to be a CD-R with a completely mediocre booklet in which all you can see is the name of Charles McPherson and the titles of the songs (no composing credits). Very strange."
3,Detailed,"This Guide book is Great when it comes to Knowing their movesets. This also advises you on The trophies and challenge mode. There is no Carrer or GM modes, though."
4,Great Fryer,"Can't agree more with the mostly positive reviews I have just read. One person mentioned filtering the used oil with cheese cloth. Try those paper, cone shaped paint filters. The cone concentrates the oil while the mesh filters the oil. Works great, really!"
2,not all its cracked up to be,"The only good features of this fryer are price and ease of cleanup. The capacity is way too small and there is no timer. Also the unit does not get hot enough to cook the food without getting the food greasy. The food tastes like its been sitting in grease, even at the highest temperature. I will return mine and go with a hotter temperature model with a timer."
2,Average fryer didn't last long,I got one of these less than a year ago and the heating element has already died. It sits out from the upper cabinets 2ft whenever it use but it steams so much you can see the results in the bottom of the upper cabinets and the whole house smells even with the filter being brand new. It beats the fry daddy fryer I had but I won't buy one again.
4,I Love it!!,"I just ordered this product to replace my OLD Fry Daddy's, I love that everything is contained and clean. I especially love the fact that I can shut the lid and lower the basket, and I just get steam and a slite oder, which disapates very quickley, with my OLD Fry Daddy, the house stunk for days!!! YUK. I have only used this product a few times sofar but I really enjoy it, it seems that the food is not so greasy, when we take the food out of the oil and put on a papertowel to drain the grease, no much drains off....the only down fall to this product is the viewing area on top, it steams up so you cant see the product frying, but not a big deal"
4,Works great!,"I would have given it five stars if it had a lid that didn't pop up so hard. Otherwise, this is a wonderful fryer. It really does filter out the smells. You should keep on the lookout for replacement filters at great prices. I bought a handful of them for less than 3 dollars each from JCPenney."
1,[not good] (unless you like cleaning oil off your counter),"Oil poured out from the vents whenever I put the basket in. In fact, the machine has a well built into the housing in the back to catch a portion of the oil. I like that you can put certain parts in the dishwasher, but it still took me over 30 minutes to get all the oil off the counter and try to get it off the machine. IF I ever use this again (which I doubt), I'll use it outdoors on plenty of old newspaper."
1,Broke after 3 uses - difficult to get fixed,"I bought this deep fryer on Amazon and used it 3 times before it broke. The on/off switch just pushed inside the unit. There is no way to get it fixed except to send it back to the manufacturer. It would sure be a lot simpler if you could get it repaired locally, or if they would even send you a box to ship it in. I am going to be stuck with the cost of shipping it to them, not to mention the hassle of dumping the oil, cleaning it out, finding a box to ship it in, and actually getting it boxed up and taken to the post office. I wouldn't recommend buying this product. Buy something that you can get repaired locally if it breaks!"
4,"Great fryer, but where are the replacement filters?","I love my T-Fal deep fryer! I've had it a year now, and find it heats up fairly quickly and is very easy to clean. However, I need to replace the filter, and can't find it anywhere! Does anyone out there have a clue?Update: I found the replacement filters on their (poorly designed) website {http://www.t-falusa.com/buynow/parts/fryers/index.html}. The online order system said delivery would take 4-6 weeks. Two months later, no filters. I called their toll-free number, found out they never received the order, and placed a second order. Filters arrived within a week. I'm frying again, yea!"
1,Piece of Junk,"Stay away. Broke the first time used. Now I have to box it up and ship it back so it can be rebuilt. I wish I had my old Fry Daddy, it worked great for 5 years."
1,Newer but not improved,"I've had a TeFal fryer for a number of years. Last year I requested a new one for Christmas. (mine needed a new seal, filter and was very well used) I was excited by the magiclean idea. But when I got it I found it light weight and cheap plastic. And no power cord. By Feb I could use it (It took a bit to get a power cord. I was originally told to return it to the store where it was purchased to exchange. Easier said then done when it was a gift from 1200 miles away.) This was when I discovered my new one could fry half what my old one did. My new one was harder to clean... AND the lid was all plastic. My old TeFal (after many years 8+??) STILL gets to temp faster, gets hotter and keeps at temp longer (and cannot be accidentally unplug...has a longer cord too). After a year I only use it when we have company over and have several loads to fry (AS A SECOND FRYER). I'm so glad I kept my old one! It deserves atleast 5 stars!!!"
2,BEWARE OF T FAL'S FREE OFFERS !,"T- FAL does NOT follow up on it's free offers and rebates. Free Hand Blender STILL not arrived since early September, and NO $10 rebate check either has arrived.When calling them on this issue......they of course have NO RECORD. One thing I am sure of....is I filled out all forms properly, and did mail within 48 hours of receiving this fryer.Numerous friends of mine also,have had the same problem with T-Fal on other offers and rebates in the past.It's quite easy for T Fal's Consumer Care people to just say we didn't receive anything from you, and put the burden of proof, once again ,on the customer. Must EVERTHING be sent to this mis- managed department via Certified Return Receipt mail?Beware, folks. I am presently asking Amazon to help on this matter with T Fal, since they are carrying this product, and showing the promos and rebates for T Fal. We shall see if any results. Stand by folks........"
2,Faulty Thermostat,"Have gone through two of these. The thermostat went bad on the first one so I returned it to the place of purchase and got it replaced . Less than a year later the same thing happened to the replacement. I loved everything about it when it worked, but I think Ill try a different brand this time."
4,Needed a little modification,"Looks great, but was difficult getting the stock to fit flush against the reciever. Had to put it on the bench grinder and remove quite a bit of plastic so it fit nice and flush with no gap showing. Besides that it's exactly what I expected"
5,Fits like a glove,This synthetic stock made by Remington for the Remington 1100 fits like a glove! The rear stock bolted right up with absolutely no gaps and the foregrip fit just like it was suppose to. It's made better and fits better than another aftermarket brand I tried. This is a really good synthetic stock for an 1100 and reasonably priced.
2,Caution,"I have no idea how anyone would call this ""good condition"". Anyone who looks at this book would be a stretch to call it ""moderate"". Previous owner(s) wrote notes in pen on every page and seemed to have incoherantly highlighted and/or underlined every word in the book. It seemed like joke at first. The only reason for 2 stars instead of one is because the book was refunded ($8 value). I like free books and will deal with it (I would have likely bought even if it said ""good binder - lots of writing""), but when advertised I as ""good condition"" this is very disappointing and I feel mislead. If you are someone who wants a ""good condition"" book look elsewhere, it is likely they don't even look through books. Wish I had a way to show pictures. However I appeciate the refund, at least they take responsibility for it."
