5,It Hurts So Good,"Millie doing her thing again. Introduced this music to my adult daughter and she said "" man does she have man problems, LOL"" Still love these throw back sounds."
4,It Hurts So Good,"i have always loved millie jackson. i am still enjoying her cd, especially hurt so good the whole cd is nice."
5,We used this for a school report,"This is a book that is useful for different purposes.It makes a great history of America, as told through the technological developments and innovative use of the materials on hand.Of course, it develops different styles and major themes in American architecture.It gives meaningful information about each of the buildings highlighted.And it features beautiful, clear, large illustrations of some very interesting structures. Using this book, it is easy to make models and draw facades of the buildings."
4,Very interesting book,"I thought the Giver was a very interesting book, which I wouldn't mind reading again. By reading the book it made me realize that there are people who have it worst than I. I am glad that I live in a society which gives me choices and freedom. The book to me was a little sad though because nobody had choices. You weren't even a loud to pick your future spouse. They wouldn't even let you go into a future career that you were interested in. They picked it for you. The book though was good I think."
1,studend form Alex VA MINNE HOWARED SCHOOL,"Really most people would like this book, but personally I think the author didn't go into enough detail on how the society *It was a completely socialistic society* was created, how they made it so people couldn't see color, and other such things. It was creative, but not in very much detail, and I would recommend this to most people, but not to the one's like me who like to see how (In the writer's opinion) these things would be done. --This text refers to the paperback edition of this title"
3,My thoughts of The Giver,"This was a very interesting book for me. It was unlike any other book I've read. It was exotic in a way. The people in this book were all the same. They all wore the same thing, did the same thing, ate the same thing, and basicly did everything everyone else was doing. When he was the Reciever of Memory, I was very happy. He was very nervous too. I expesially liked the part when he and Gabe left and found a new place to live. It was very heartwarming."
5,Give me The Giver!,"I just finished The Giver. It is so full of emotions! I cried, threw the book and got sick to my stomach when their were bad moments. The good ones make you so happy!You can actually see the memories. I recommend this book to everyone!"
3,Overview of Philosophies,"This book compares Frankl's teachings to many different psychologists and philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to BF Skinner, Carl Rogers, Freud, and many others who you may recognize. Each chapter compares and contrasts Frankl to different people.'A good reminder of roots of Psychology in general, although I prefer, in studying Frankl, to read his own words more directly.This is more of a textbook on psychology and a good review of philosophy and psychology from early times.Not a quick and easy read unless you are already well versed in these areas."
2,Not for my future vet. . .,"I like Barbie. And, I like that Barbie is promoting professional occupations to role model for young girls.But, this doll doesn't look professional to me. I just don't care for the capri pants, tight fitting coat, etc.I wanted a professional looking doll to help my daughter play, learn, and develop interest in a possible future career. I chose the Breyer vet doll. It has a professional white coat, shirt, and kaki pants."
1,Lousy.,"Pretty cruddy game. Completely non-user friendly. You can't get rid of the stupid cops or traffic even though it says you can. The cops and the traffic make for a very frustrating race. The steering is very stiff and if you mess up just once, you have no chance of winning the race. The tracks are short and boring and the scenery is nothing interesting."
1,I wanted to give this game NO stars.,"This is probably the worst driving simulator I have ever purchased. The cars do have differing handling characteristics but they are all equally flighty, it's iether straight, full left or right, no middle ground anywhere in the game. The graphics are poor and the fun factor is a negative. The choice of vehicles is impressive but the detail is lacking. I found that to purchase more than one car was extremely cumbersome and I found I was constantly waiting for screens to load. If you enjoy GranTurismo or even TOCA2 I would not buy this game. This game left me feeling that I had wasted my time and money."
2,Not very entertaining.,"For a racing game, this one ain't too hot. The tracks are not very long or intricate. A few lame shortcuts per track. The handling is pretty difficult to get used to and the graphics aren't too exciting. I wish playstation would stop wasting valuable data space with stupid movie clips and soundtrack music. This space could be used to make the actual playable part of the game better. The cops are really annoying and the fact that you have to bet money on the races is kind of dumb. I'm not interested in all the extra junk. I want a racer that is devoted to the racing. Take Rush 2 for the N64. Now that's a racing game. This one, however, is not."
2,"Compared to previous test drives, this one tanks",O.k. the reason that this game sucks is because it wasn't designed by the same people that did test drive 4 and 5. The graphics are terrible it's like a badly drawn cartoon. I might have been able to look past that just a little however the cars drive terribly also. two thumbs down!~
1,horribly bias game,"When was the last time you saw a game with 5 different kinds of Mustangs and no Camaros, or Vettes, or some GM car? That's this game in a nut shell for ya. They even have an SVT Lightning...for what reason? In the history of all racing it is a FACT (not opinion) that GM has dominated over all in domestic motorsports. So how come this game has only a few Domestic cars, and they are mostly Fords with a Couple of Chryslers? All the rest of the Test Drives were balanced (Especially TD5-great game!) IF you are a Blue Oval fan than this is a game for you...otherwise, if you like real racing...stick to TD5 or GT2."
1,Terrible organization and truncated content,"This is one of the worst text books I've had to use so far in my graduate studies. The way in which the authors organized the book makes little sense. They give you a bit of information on the topic and then an activity that really doesn't help you understand the material. As far as the material goes the authors included some interesting resources but decided to just use small extracts from different articles to make their point. This made class discussion very superficial since we only had a superficial understanding of the topic at hand. I usually keep my books after a class is over however, this book will not be one of them. I'm definitely selling this back even if I don't get much back for it."
4,Funky and catchy.,"Very good freshman attempt for Avi. Interesting rhythmns and phrasings are what make this album interesting to listen to, not to mention that he has Jan Jackson on drums who is a super funky drummer and also Michael Bluestein on Keyboards who is an amazing keyboard player. Avi himself is reluctantly known for his chikawa funky rhythmns. He should be proud of what he has accomplished having toured with John Scofield. If Avi did not have quite the attitude that he has developed, I'm sure more opportunities would present themselves to him. That seems to be a reoccuring issue with musicians. Great guitar player, super funky rhythmns and catchy phrases. I would strongly recommend this album."
5,Grows on you - I'm a fan,"Discovered Avi via Pandora. He plays on Scofield's Uberjam album and the albums are very similar. Both are all instrumental jazz based, but very funky albums. Playing is top self and there are looks of great hooks on this album, which will have you coming back for more."
1,MacOS X For someone that has never used a computer,"The subject should be the title of this Book.....This book is at such a beginner level that I am surprised that it was even written.It covers only the most very basics of MacOS X and the troubleshooting section (why I bought the book) is a complete joke....It definitely was not worth the [money] I paid for it...this is a book to get your parents if they buy a computer for the first time after MacOS X comes pre-installed as the default OS from Apple.I cannot believe that Ms. Bucki would write such a beginner book when OS X is not the default OS or, at the time when this book came out, not even pre-installed as an optional OS...I think I will write my own OS X Book now....it is obvious that it cannot be hard to write a beginners book after looking at this one..."
3,Great NOVICE BOOK,I too was disappointed in this book. I thought I was getting something that would help me with the transition from OS9 to OSX. I was definitely wrong. I give this book 3 stars however because it is a good book for someone that has never used a computer before and is getting one with OS X on it. Just disappointed by it's marketing targets.
4,A fantastic newbie book.,"I purchased this book for my sister. I recently purchased a used iMac for her with OS X installed as the default operating system. She has never used a personal computer before. I read the book before I mailed it to her and found that I do agree with the others opinion that this is not for a person who uses any computer regularly. It is very basic and if the first computer they are introduced to happens to be a Macintosh running OS X, I found the book to be very appropriate and educational. The book is a quick read and for someone like my sister, with no computer experience, I fill confident that she'll be able to get around in the operating system and learn the basic skills she'll need to learn more. This book is a great place to start!"
5,Oh my how you sparkle! <3,"My husband (married 12 years, this year) bought this beauty for me for Valentine's Day. It sparkles like mad, the diamonds are just gorgeous and I find myself falling in love with this ring more and more every time I glance down at my hand and it blinds me with sparkle. 101% recommendation from me."
4,Army of One: Available NOW at Amazon UK,"Listen up Punisher people! If you want to score a copy of the hard to get Punisher Army of One, Amazon UK is your best friend.I paid $28, including air freight, for my copy. The cover art is different but the classic US version cover is contained in the reprints inside.Now, on to the story. Garth Ennis cleverly creates a Super Villain for the Punisher to battle. The Russian, a buffoonish beast, is a modern day Frankenstein, pumped up with Gorilla lungs, 2 hearts, a hardened skeleton and a reattached head. The Russian is a villain tough enough to fight Frank one on one.Steve Dillon's art is great, but leans towards the Punisher as super-hero rather than as super-vigilante. There's plenty of killing but Dillon depicts Frank in the usual superhero tights. I prefer the combat solidier look myself.This is a very enterating read and you'll be happy to outsmart the North American scarcity of this title by hopping the Pond and pocketing your Punisher at Amazon UK."
3,More of the same...,"Basically more of the same. Garth Ennis isn't quite ""there"" yet and this is essentially a retread of Welcome Back, Frank with a new set of bad guys. There are some welcome returns (Soap) and some unwelcome encores (The Russian). If you thought The Russian was too ""cartoony"" last time, wait 'til you see him now. The character really drags down the book and is a bigger part of this one than he was in Welcome Back, Frank. Still provides enough mindless entertainment to make it worth parting with your dollars, but the REALLY good stuff doesn't come until the next book."
2,Trying hard humor,"The humor in this book is so contrived, it mars the otherwise action-packed book. What the creators did with The Russian is more apt for a Deadpool book rather than the gritty, grim world of Frank Castle (However, I enjoyed the ""team-up"" of Spidey and Castle). It seems the Ennis and Dillon are trying very hard to be cool and relive the glory days of their Preacher run (which I enjoyed by the way)."
4,"Solid, understandable, and refreshingly honest","In an era where ""self-help"" masquerades as spiritual guidance, Rev. Guenther's presentation, well grounded in the scriptures and the traditions of ascetic theology, is exceedingly valuable. The writing is very clear and understandable, when even the more difficult truths are presented."
3,Holy Listening,Book was in condition as listed and it arrived earlier than predicted. Early arrival was greatly appreciated. Thank you.It was good to have a used book as I enjoyed reading the margin comments and the highlighted sections were also helpful.
5,Very sensible and realistic approach to Spiritual Direction!,"I am a reader from Argentina and really loved reading the book, which I found to be a very sensible and realistic approach to Spiritual Guidance. I am Roman Catholic, finished a two year chourse on Spiritual directiion and learnt a lot with M. Guenthers' book. She puts into words, in a very simple manner what Spiritual Direction is all about. Her examples are very clear and I found the book so interesting to read. I especially liked chapter 3, where she compares the director to a midwife. I have read many other books on this subject, bun none was so practical as this one."
5,Spiritual Direction IS Holy Listening,"The characterization of a spiritual director by the description ""Holy Listener"" encapsulates the book's central theme. Through the progressive introduction of topics, the author guides the reader to a deeper understanding of the ""art"" in spiritual direction. Drawing on her own experiences as a spiritual director, the author relates guiding principles for providing spiritual direction from an variety of perspectives. Most insightful is her description of the spiritual director as ""a holy listener"", a soul-companion, whose heart and presence provides a hospitable haven for ""fellow travelers"". The experience and wisdom imparted through Margaret Guenther's writing proffers what could be viewed as the depth and breath of the art in spiritual direction. There is much to be gained by contemplating the various perspectives the author provides and in understanding the tremendous privilege it is to serve as a ""Holy Listener""."
4,My ancestory ran in my ears,"I picked up the CD as a fluke for some ""different"" music to listen to while trying to de-stress on the job. Little did I know how entranced my ears and heart would be. As a former singer, I can appreciate what these three gentlemen do with their talents. For me, though, I'll take the sound of Anthony Kearns and John McDermott with Kearns being the truer Irish tenor for my listening pleasure. I'm ordering the tape for my boyfriend to listen to while on the road. Our ancestors would be thrilled to hear any and every song on this recording--you see, he's part Irish too!"
5,irish tenors hit a home run !,"the irish tenors bring Ireland to the world with this break-out performance.All three of these extremely talented gentlemen shined on this album,but none so brightly as Ronan Tynan,whose voice is nothing short of outstanding.A must Holiday gift-buy one for yourself too !the irish tenors bring ireland to the world with"
5,I can't get enough of this magnificant piece of artistry,"I have seen the PBS showing 3 times, recorded it on my VCR, and can't seem to get enough. I just keep playing it over, over, over, and listen to the CD everyday - I'm like an ""irish tenor junkie"", really hooked. All three are simply magnificient, but my favorite is Anthony Kearns. He is an absolute delight to watch (oooooh, so talented and cute, too!) - his rendition of Grace is so beautiful and emotional it brings tears to my Irish eyes and truly makes me thank the good Lord for being able to hear (something we take for granted) - I truly feel blessed that I am able to hear and watch these wonderful and inspiring talented gentlemen. Hope PBS is going to schedule more of their concerts. Does anybody have any background info on Anthony Kearns? If so, would love to hear from you."
5,COMPLETELY WONDERFUL,"AFTER SEEING THE THREE IRISH TENORS ON PBS I WENT STRAIGHT AWAY TO BUY THE CD. IT STIRRED IN ME THE WARMEST FEELING FOR MY IRISH HERATIGE THAT I YET HAVE HAD IN MY 42 YEARS OF LIFE. I AM SO HAPPY THAT THEY HAD THE CONCERT AND THAT PBS CARRIED IT. MY THANKS TO ALL THREE MEN, THEY WARMED MY HEART."
2,Crying Jag Lovefest,"I love this CD. I saw them in person and it was an awesome experienc. I was never so happy to be crying in my life. When I listen to this CD I feel that I have my dear departed Irish Catholic grandmother on one shoulder and my darling late mother on the other. The music tugs at your heart. Each tenor has his own unique style. You feel like you should be in a pub, drinking a beer when listening to the homey sound of John McDermott. Anthony Kearns breaks your heart when he sings Grace. Ronan Tynan makes you think of your first love when he sings When You Were Sweet Sixteen and he makes you yearn to go back home when he sings The Town I Loved So Well. Only the Rivers Run Free makes you realize the pain the Irish feel. I love, love, love this CD."
5,The Best of Irish Folk Music,This always has been among my all time favorites. Somehow my original CD got lost but through Amazon.com I again have a copy. The music is beautiful by itself and is enhanced by harmony of these three tenors. By reading the lyrics and attaching them to an Irish historical event adds depth and emotion to those events.
5,"The Iristh Tenors/McNamara, McDermott, Kearns, Tynan","CD was in perfect condition, it played very well, the seller was excellent, he sent it promptly and in a very well protected pactage. We were so pleased with this and want to compliment the seller. We would rate him with AAA+++. Thank you so much for selling this on Amazon, we love it.dlrsoren@msn.com"
5,Wonderful!,"This cd makes me proud to be an O'Brien, proud to be Irish, and infinitely proud to be able to pass this along to our three young Irish sons, so they will know from where they come!"
5,Very armenian,"Undoutebly, Khachaturian is a composer that sounds the best under autoctonalperformers. Those are very exciting and idiomatic performances that are goodvalue to know and to have. This Kachaturian's symphony Nr.2 by Tjeknavoriancould be considered as the reference among the reviewed versions. An essentialfor a Khachaturian collection."
5,One the best recent ska albums,"I found out about Mustard Plug by mistake one day when I was in a record store and took a gamble in buying Pray For Mojo. I was lucky to have found my now favorite ska band. Everything about this album (and their Mustard Plug's others) is amazing. Great horns and bass, catchy lyrics, punchy guitars- all make this one a must-have."
4,Skank till u drop,Midwest Madness. Thats all I have to say about mustard plug. This is a great ska band that can really turn out great tunes. This is a definately a harder version of the mighty mighty bosstones and others. great band. Lolita is a great song along with throw a bomb.
3,Mediocre 3rd Wave Ska,"Here's the lowdown: There's two really good songs on this album (""Send You Back"", ""Throw A Bomb"") and the rest is passable filler."
1,"The Simpsons rule, but Mustard Plug.....","Lets be honest here-I know next to nothing about mustard plug and I have little interest in finding out more. Judging from the other customer reviews, I would guess they are a bunch of overly-pretentious, 'serious punks'(or maybe thats just their fans). The only redeeming factor for me is the title man-its really funny! Its one of the great lines('Pray...for...Mojo') from the greatest sitcom of all-time, The Simpsons. I would advise purchasers to buy songs in the key of springfield instead, because its likely to bring a broad smile to your face and make you laugh. And, of course, isnt 'laughter the language of the soul'....."
2,This CD was a big letdown,"After having heard Big Daddy Multitude and Evildoers Beware I was extremely disappointed by this album. Mustard Plug wrote too many mediocre love songs for this album. Even their non-love songs like ""Throw a Bomb"" and ""We're gunna take on the world"" are nowhere nearly as good as any songs on Evildoers Beware. Unless you are total fanatic of Mustard Plug this album is not worth buying."
5,No problems,"I am satisfied with the service . The ink came on time as promised, it was packaged well. I am using it now and have not had any problems with it."
2,50% Failure Rate,"After installation, the printer rejected the first cartridge without printing a single page! Printer kept telling me to remove and ""check"" the cartridge. After removing and reinstalling it 5 times, I through it away! The second on is working so far but a 50% failure rate is terrible. If you need this product as a spare, it might be worth it. If you need this for work... steer clear or you may find yourself running to Walmart in a hurry."
4,Student Assignment Book Review,"I really enjoyed this book. I had to do a book report on a book and chose this one. The story of Joe Talbot getting wrongly accused and the entire story of him, with the help of his dog, presuming his innocence, is very captivating. It reminds me of the story ""The Maltese Falcon"" but for kids. I rated it 4 stars out of 5, only because of the little side story between Wishbone and his lady dog friend. That part of the story to me had nothing to do with the plot in the book and to me was just a waste of time reading."
3,Not enough to pass CCNP,"This book is more useful for final revision for the CCNP. It does not cover any topic in enough detail to give you the depth of understanding you need for the CCNP. The CD that comes with the book is TERRIBLE. It has errors, missing portions and shows that it was rushed out without any proper quality checking. In short, stick to the Cisco Press books for CCNP information."
4,Excelente grabación!,"Escuché por primera vez de este disco a principios de los 90's, anunciado en televisión, se me hizo súperinteresante, pero no tuve oportunidad de comprarlo. Lo busqué y busqué y no podía encontrarlo, hasta ahorita gracias al Internet.Todo el álbum está magnífico, las voces de Lourdes, Magda, Claudio y Mario Iván hacen un collage excelente y se amalgaman a la perfección. Mis favoritas: ""Chacona"", ""Dame albricia mano Antón"", ""Sereníssima una noche"" y ""Guarda la fiera""."
2,Very Incomplete in so many ways,"This has some information that should have been printed in the user's manual packaged with the game. It is missing, so as not to be redundant, information included in that manual. Both printed items are effectively incomplete. The game evolves, now has continents, equipment, spells, etc. that are not in this manual. In creating some characters, new players will be disappointed in the results, since the information is inaccurate or incomplete to the realities of how the players need to play. Save your money. Or even better, donate the purchase price of the book to the websites use use to obtain the same types of information."
3,Good book for beginners but...,"This book is a good (not excellent) source for beginners. It gives you spells, class descriptions, and grouping tactics. PLus they give you a break down of each race. The only problem is, the more experienced you get, the more you discover how many errors it has. I have counted at least 10, without even scanning every detail in the book. They are just plain and simple errors. It's unbelievable what kind of info they give to newbies. Even though as I said it's a good source, they have bogus information for beginners. I would recommend this book only to ppl who have no clue what this game is or who is new to RPG's."
1,Nothing New...,"There's nothing in the book that you can't get in 15 minutes from various sites on the internet. Better maps are easily found on eqmaps.com or eqatlas.com. The spell listings are found on many, MANY sites. Same for items and where they drop.. I wouldn't spend any cash on this book. Like someone said before, there's no information that you wouldn't know after playing 1 week.. And if you are a total newbie, just read some infromative articles on starting up a character on various websites. Just as much good information."
3,Outdated,"When this first came out it was an awesome source of information about the world of Norath. But with all the patches over the past two and a half years, coupled with the release of SoL Expansion this book is severely outdated. Your best bet is to go on Alakhazam.com, Castersrelmn.com, check out the links from those sites and then get the SoL Guidebook for all the info you need.Nevlow EvrhighDruid of TunareVasaelle ServerHate me But Fear me!!"
3,Must have if you are just starting,If you are just starting the game and don't have any friends that play this is a must have. When I first started I had no idea what i was doing and I created a character and picked a bad race/class combination and didn't spend my skill points correctly. After months of playing I noticed I did my character all wrong and had to start all over. This book would have saved me alot of time if I had it before I started playing
2,Most of this can be found on website,"Not only can you find most of this stuff on website but when it comes to games like everquest, where things do change on a regular basis, books like this quickly become out-dated. Save yourself a few bucks and go do a search on the internet for ""everquest"", their are many excellent sites that will provide you with the information that is in this book for nothing or for a low fee."
2,"A newbie bought, a newbie read","Well, actually other people might have said this book is good for newbies. Sure, it has all the charts neatly laid out and everything. But if you don't own the game yet, you should buy the game and the book together. That way you can have the best starting character. The reason why I bought the book was not for the data tables, but to try to learn more about the land I was at. How to earn experience faster, and how to navigate Norrath as best as I could. Unfortunately, the book does not tell you much about earning experience (just that there are four ways, and what they are), and maps seriously need some help. This is the improved and revised edition?! Wow, this is pretty bad, I wonder what the original strategy guide looked like."
4,It's A Good Book,"Okay, so maybe you can get all this information on the web. But can you get it so neatly and precisely laid out and accessible? Unless you're into printing dozens of pages or have two PCs side-by-side this book is the best resource for getting started in the game.The layout is well done. There are some great starting tips for each character class and each race. The spells section is well done with detailed information only for the lower level spells. At first, I was angered by that but then I realized that there is some fun to be had in the mystery of what your next set of spells will bring.All in all, this book is a great read for the starting player and also an excellent reference for anyone (even a veteran player) starting a new character in a class that he or she is unfamiliar."
3,Why wasn't this the instruction manual?,"As even the most devout EverQuest player will admit, the instruction manual for EQ was a cheap ploy to get you to buy this, the Player's Guide. However, the guide itself is pretty well written, (if occasionally wildly inaccurate) and is a handy reference book for those who want information WHILE PLAYING the game. The only other alternative is to print out a ton of unorganized internet information- just think about how much you're saving in ink expenses! The innacuracies that do occur regard minor things- Wizards casting healing spells, Rogues trying to cheat you all the time, and omitting Dark Elves from the High Elf Racial Enemy Chart. A good supplement, especially as a gift."
5,"WOW - Be Sure To Get The ""Revised"" Version!!","WOW!! This book nails the details of EVERQUEST, so if you are serious about playing this online game, be sure to pick up a copy of this book. There are about three versions of the book, so BE SURE TO GET THE ""REVISED"" VERSION (it has the red triangle in the lower left corner).Also, be sure to compare the races before setting up your character then be sure to obtain the applicable maps to maximize your efficiency. You will only regret this if you decide to jump into the game without them (easy to get lost).Good Luck with EVERQUEST and don't forget to order a copy of THIS book (be sure to have your buddies get a copy, too)!"
3,Great for Newbies,"We bought this book originally at the same time that we purchased Kunark, which was our first foray into the EQ world. Having played for a fair amount of time now, I can easily say that this book has no real useful information for experienced players. I will whip out the book on occassion to look up info about a spell but there's nothing else in this book that I look up or read about. There's a ton of useful sites on the web that can give you the information that this book sorely lacks. If you're new to EQ, I'd recommend this book highly to give you a solid ground to learn from, but if you're an experienced player, don't bother."
5,A definitive examination of upper-class Jews in Berlin during the latter half of the 1700's and the first half of the 1800's,"European history professor Deborah Hertz presents Jewish High Society In Old Regime Berlin, a definitive examination of upper-class Jews in Berlin during the latter half of the 1700's and the first half of the 1800's. Focusing especially upon the salons and those who attended them, Jewish High Society In Old Regime Berlin draws upon statistics, anecdotes, historical references and biographies, and is illustrates with occasional black-and-white diagrams or photographs. Evenhandedly examining the lives of both men and women, Jewish High Society In Old Regime Berlin is smoothly written and highly readable to historians and lay people alike."
1,This game is too simple and has poor graphics!,"Stay away from this racer! All you have to do to win is mash down on the gas, even after multiple wipeouts. And also this games graphics were below par. If you want a new rally racer wait for Top Gear Rally 2."
3,not as much as i expected,"well, i really expected a much better racing game, but, anyway, it is a good game... a good choice of cars, but i think they should have added more WRC cars, since it is what most players look for... it had some good graphics, but not awesome... another thing that i missed was a complete car setup, such as the one in F-1 world grand prix, not just, sensible, soft, hard. At first it is pretty difficult to control the car, but, as you keep focused on the game, you will succeed... a fair game, a good game, yet, not a must have... it is not as fun as I expected, yet a good one... ah! one more thing, it is not just accelerate and drive. you must think every turn. that's it, a good, fair game. not outstanding. got it?"
2,Not what I had thought it would be...,Very basic information which you could aquire through watching Court TV. I work as a Police Officer and thought this would benefit me but after reading the book it was mearly a very basic review.
3,"Good, but not great........","If you want a simple description for the feel of this game, think ""Blade Runner"" meets ""Resident Evil."" However, the game has several flaws which take away from it's beautiful backgrounds, and scenery. First of all, thi sgame should have had some live action in game movies. This would make the story, and gameplay more fun. Second, it is way to easy to get killed. This is soooo not fair. When your fear meter gets red, you can die with one shot. And no continues? What's that all about? These are just to name a few flaws. This game would be much better if it was rented at Blockbuster for the weekend. Once you get going, the game is pretty simple, and short, but too many flaws take away from it's over all presentation."
2,too confusing,i dont own this game. a friend of mine let me borrow it. thank goodness i didn't waste my money on this piece of crap!its too hard to figure out what to do. plus it gives you motion sickness.
3,Not so Fear Effect,This game got really boring really fast. If you have played games like Resident Evil then you will more than likely hate this game. The constant dieing and restarting gets really repetative and startes to get on your nerves. After a while when you do get really good with the controls the game does start to get kinda fun but the transition period is really boring. I think three for a rating is a bit too high but once you get the hang of the game it does start to get fun.
5,One Word: SWEEEEET!,"I rate games on a scale of one to ten, ten being best, in different categories. |Graphics: 10| Sound: 10 | Gameplay: 8| Plot: 10 | Voice Acting: 10 | Fun: 10 | Replay: 10| Average is 9.7142 or A+. Rated M (Mature) for Graphic Violence, Gore, Vulgar Language, Adult Themes, and Brief Nudity"
5,Finally - A game that offers challenge,"This game has everything. Great dialogue and speech (unlike Final Fantasy), hard and taxing puzzles (unlike Resident Evil), hard and challenging bosses (again, unlike Resident Evil) and an amazing, complex, adult storyline. This is more like a movie. The twists of the story, I won't give them away, are great and it is one of few Playstation games that offers a good challenge. It is Resident Evil style but Res Evil is much too easy and the dialogue in the cut scene is bad. In FEAR EFFECT the cross between FMV and active play is created well and there is no significant change in graphics. It is a great game, long (4 discs), challenging with both puzzles and bosses and packed with action. If you liked Res Evil, BUY THIS!!!!!"
4,Excellent!,"Fear Effect is excellent! The graphics are fun, the storyline is great, the gameplay is exciting... It is the best game I have played in a while.THE DOWNSIDE: The game has very little replay value, and it is not very long. It only took a few hours to beat. The game IS fun, though -- once I beat it, I went right back to play through in Hard Mode. After that, though, there was nothing more to the game.VERDICT: You should definitely rent this game if it interests you at all (you will not be disappointed). I would not recommend buying it, though."
5,Fear it again!,"I was looking for this game for the longest time! Finally I found it! Players out there, looking to know what a great Action Game is all about, look no further. Fear Effect change the way of how I play video games. I was an all around player, and this game put Me exclusively on the action genre club forever. The graphics at the time were top notch, the game play, amazing, the story was edgy. The main character was on par with Lara Croft, even better, the story drove her to places that Lara did not want to tackle. Overall, it is a great experience that no action gamer should miss. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION! Let the Fear begin..."
4,Pretty good game,"It's not too tough to get through it, you may want to rent it before you buy it. But, the visuals, play, etc. are all wonderful."
2,DISSAPOINTING,"The game is ok, gameplay wise. The controls are a little awkward, and it may be annoying to switch through inventory while fighting compared to pausing, then switching a weapon. The controls are like those of many other action games, such as Resident Evil III and Galerians. They can be really awkward when solving the first puzzle in-game of the game. You always end up dying before you master the controls. It is really easy to die, and it is annoying that the Fear Meter gets worse if you are closer to an enemy, making it even easier to die than before. The first boss is nearly impossible to defeat if you dont have fully loaded mach pistols, and even then he is nearly impossible because he can kill you in two, sometimes one hit.It is MUCH MORE frustrating than challenging. Another flaw: this game can be beaten in less than five hours. i beat it the first day i rented it."
2,Not what I expected...,"When i read the reviews on this game i thought it was going to be an instant classic! What a suprise i got when i bought it. This game starts out way too slow for one thing, and also the games graphics are just terrible! The anime/ 3D style of graphics does not work at all. Looking at that game made my eyes water, it was like looking at a blurry picture. Besides that the game is a little cheap if you ask me. You will die countless times because of certain view or angles in the game. Not to mention the fear meter! That thing is worthless! Once the fear meter goes up, you have to get a one-hit kill for it to go back down. You should have a drink or something that can bring the fear meter down. Once you play this game through, you will not want to play it again, i know i didn't. The only thing some poeple might find interesting in this game is that their are a hand full of curse words, and a bit of skin. Then again it's only blurry polygons..."
5,The best action/adventure game I've played,"Having waited quite a while for this game to come out, it would have been easy to be disappointed. That is why I am so excited that it was worth the wait. The gameplay is fantastic, with the controls being difficult to get used to, but once you do, the game is fantastic. The graphics are unreal, and the story is great! One great innovation is the health meter. They have changed it a bit so that you have a fear factor. The more afraid your character is, the less it will take for you to die. But on the flipside, the better you react to adverse situations, the more confident you become, and the less likely it is that your fear factor will increase. If you are looking for a game that has action, a great story, and some of the best graphics around, buy Fear Effect."
2,Don't believe the hype,"First of all, I'd like to say that, contrary to what I'm reading, violence, nudity, and bad language do not make a game ""mature.""Fear Effect PROS: Good graphics, fluid animation.Fear Effects CONS: crappy voice acting, juvenille dialogue (yeah, real mature people), dull gameplay. Sorry, but I just couldn't get into this one. It was neat to see the cartoon-like graphics but the novelty was short-lived. I really wanted to like this game (after reading all the hype) but was sorely disappointed. It's just no fun."
3,Replay Value,I just started playing this game and I like it. I don't like these reviews that say the replay value is bad. It makes me not really want to play the game because replaying the game has been one of my favorite things about the Resident Evil series.
3,This is a HARD game!!,"When I saw previews for this game, I knew that I was going to have to get it. Turns out that the game really is as good as I thought it would be, only about 10 times as hard! I have never died in ANY game as much as I have in this one. one of the bad things about the game is that there is no way to heal yourself, you just get healed when you get to certain points. The other bad thing is the loading time when you continue after dying. The inventory is very hard to work with also, it takes a lot to get used to. The graphics in the game are great and the cut scenes are like watching a cartoon.You need to have a lot of patience to play this game but it is pretty fun."
4,Channeling thought's,"The oil filter pliers work well,but I have to know be right up front,the length of the curve of the the jaw doesn't allow for enough gripping length a 12''set would be a better alternative.O'well better luck next time."
2,No news here,"If you are looking for a tiny booklet that is not breed-specific but does contain some cute pictures, this is for you. On the other hand, if you want to know what makes your little Yorkie do the things she does, continue searching."
5,Excellent read,"This book is great! Progress captures the essence of a small town and pulls you into the mystery that the natives encounter. Twice a year I visit a beach that is similar to Playa Bonita and found this story believable and thought provoking. The author creates credible characters that speak for themselves. The story is filled with mystery, suspense, romance, and humor. There is something for everyone in this suspensful page turner. I couldn't put it down. The auther creates a world that is rich and dramatic with a plot that never stops developing. It is a book that makes you want to skip ahead to see how it ends, but the author's writing forces you to slow down and savor the storytelling."
3,Nice tool but could be better,"I really like my saw...now. When I bought it, I liked it until I discovered it has a little play in the armature. This resulted in a few innacurate cuts. Now that I understand my tool (like any machine), I love it. Next time, I will find a saw with no play..."
3,Very portable - use it several times per month,"I have had this saw about 2 years - cutting mainly 2x4 and 4x4 treated lumber to install ramps at homes. I like the light weight and compact size. Things I would change if I could - dust collection dumps into cover over back hinge, eventually limiting the height that the blade can be raised. The price and weight are right on. The 13 amp motor is adequate."
3,Not bad for small jobs...,"I got this one because it's small enough to take to job sites, but it's not big enough to do the vigorous cross-cutting in my workship -- max stock width is 6"" (nominal). Unless you're going to lug it around, go with a sliding 10 or better 12"" saw. Other than that, I love the saw. Quality is very good..."
2,Defective handle and no replacement for it.,"I have been using this saw for over two years and it does a good job only just the other day the power switch would not stop when I let go. I unpluged it and took the handle apart and found that the handle was breaking inside and a piece of plastic fell into the swith and keep it on all the time. (safety hazard) Then I went online and tried to order a new handle and guess what, they obsoleted the part and their is NO replacement part."
5,The glory of jazz,"This is a 20th anniversary album on Mosaic, celebrating Phil Woods and his quartet. It is simply incredible. What a national crime that this is no longer available. The quartet tell us of all the glories of jazz, swing, tenderness, power, imagination, complexity. Bird lives...here and forever."
5,Great Watch!,"It's a stylish watch. It looks elegant and tells time well, as is the Pulsar reputation. Can't expect any more than that."
5,Excellent book,If you actually are interested in getting married and are grown up enough to understand what that involves then I'd strongly recommend this book. This book could be useful both for finding a spouse but also to decrease the odds that one would get divorced. As one who has taught doctoral students in counseling it was refreshing to see a book like this one that was written at a level which could be understandable but also included useful information that should be effective at getting the individual who utilizes the information to get married and have a marriage that would last. I personally purchased 4 copies of the book.
5,Speaks right to me.,"This book is a gem, full of Melodie Beattie'w wonderful wisdom and her words speak right to me. I have used some of her words of wisdom to improve my life and they have worked!! I can never go wrong with Melodie Beattie, no matter what she writes!"
5,"Wonderful Read to Follow ""Language of Letting Go' - A Must!","After working a 12 step for 9 months, read Language of Letting Go. Brought me in touch w/my feelings. Then my spouse went intoAA. ""More Language of Letting Go"" continued me on my path togetting in touch w/my feelings. There's no index, but youwill find it comical how you do read the book. I highlyrecommend Beattie's ""Journey to the Heart"" as a follow-up tothis one!By reading these 3 books, I know more what I want and can namethe things I want. Before I couldn't.Beattie pegs it beautifully, when no one else can."
4,Great resource,I'm a therapist and I purchase this meditation book and The (first) Language of Letting Go for some of my clients. They report finding them very helpful in their recovery journey. This book is arranged a little differently than the first and is laid out in a progression. They are both in my top 3 of great daily meditation books.
4,Good Book,"I would recommend this book to anyone going through a tough time in their lives. It is a daily reminder to keep you going in the right direction. I do not like that it is so religious, but otherwise enjoy the book very much."
5,Saved my life,"This book is for anyone going through any type of recovery: codependency, addiction, divorce. Daily affirmations that tell us that yes we are important and we are not crazy!"
2,Disappointed!,"The original ""Language of Letting Go"" is absolutely my favorite daily meditation book! So, I purchased ""More Language of Letting Go"" with great anticipation. I have never been so disappointed in a book in my life! It was more like reading someone's diary of personal adventures. It was full of egocentric comparisons between skydiving and daily struggles. I didn't find it inspirational at all."
5,A treasure of a book,"These short daily writings are insightful and profound. It is amazing how on many days, what is written for that day is exactly what I need to hear. I recommend this very highly. I have both books and jump between them. They both compliment each other completely. Good whether you have a lot of time in your day, or if you are rushed."
2,Suprised by the content,I was really surprised to find out that 366 new meditations were just stories taken from the author's life because I expected to find in there a closed eye guided meditations.
2,caused me anxiety,"working long days takes away my energy for later in the evening, so i thought this would help. definitely gives you an energy boost but gave me a lot of anxiety. and i'm not sure if the ingredients are really getting absorbed either. may work for others though."
5,good for brown areas on lawn,"If you got a low end job done on your lawn irrigation you may find that you have brown areas around sprinkler heads in sunny areas in your garden, apparently from poor head to head coverage (or lack thereof). I was just about to add some sprinklers on the line but luckily my neighbor introduced me to this type of undercut sprinkler head - it produces a second jet for water close to the head, works best if you have good pressure in the line - worth a few bucks to give it a try. It worked for me."
5,Works great on popup sprinklers.,"This dual spray level, full circle nozzle works great on Rainbird popup sprinklers. I haven't tried it with other sprinkler brands. This product is excellent at making sure the spray does not miss the plants closer to the nozzle. The non-dual spray nozzles tend to ""shoot over"" the area near the sprinkler. This product addresses that issue."
3,not a trditional set,this set is a decent set however it lacks all of the pieces its missing the metal square to help hold it together other than that it is a good set have not broken them yet
3,Ok for the price,"I wouldn't go to war with these things. The red strings on the shaft of the sword needed to be duct taped immediately. The tape is holding up fine though. I got these so I could have sword fights with my 9 year old son. Yes, I'm a big kid.. We were swinging fairly hard. I wouldn't use these in a martial arts school or anything. But if your just looking for fun to beat your kids with then this is just for you. Warning: Your kids will most likely kick your ass. I didn't stand a chance."
3,Semi-durable shinai,"Shinai lasted a little while, which was a big improvement from ""full force bokken"" purchased earlier (other review for them.) Still have one that's holding together well, the other broke in two. Would look at something more durable if I was more serious about sparring scenario."
4,Great swords for practice,These are great for getting a little practice in. They are not the best ones I have ever used but when you are just going to be beating them up all day they are well worth it.
3,Ok for Beginners,"These shinai are good for beginners if you're going to start practicing kendo. They do NOT come with the tsuba (hand guards) pictured. I would not recommend using these for contact drills - especially not without kote. Decent price, though."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE,"So I was a bit short on money when I killed my last shinai, so I decided to cheap out and buy these. I pulled them apart to prep them for normal wear and found that they had no sakigomu. Because of this, They are not tournament legal and my old dojo would not even allow you to practice with them. Serious bummer.On top of all that, when I actually measured them, they were only 40"" (102ish cm) in length. most certainly not what I thought that I bought."
1,Very poor shinai.,"I bought these as a quick, cheap replacement for my last shinai, thinking that even if they were not excellent at least I'd have a spare. The parts that are traditionally leather (sakigawa, tsuka, and nakayuki) are made of a cheap, dry foam that disintegrates on contact (literally - my shirt was covered in foam particles when I unwrapped them). The bamboo is of the lowest quality, and looks like it will splinter at the lightest suggestion of contact; one reviewer has experienced quick breakage already. If the bamboo takes oil well I may rewrap them and use them as long as I can, but there is nothing to recommend these shinai."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a set of two ""bamboo"" swords, for a rather decent price. However, the wood is some sort of composite, and after less than a day, during a light practice session, one of the swords broke clean through at the hilt. All four pieces of wood broke in an almost straight line. Now, this may be atypical, because one sword was noticeably lighter than the other (that's the one that broke) so be sure to read other reviews as well."
5,It's GREAT for Me.,"I very much needed a new vacuum cleaner, but needed one that would work for ME.. Being handicapped I cannot reattach some of the dust cups on some other vacs, or even change a bag. So was looking for something I COULD use. This fit the bill. Not only is it easy for me to take off and put on the dust cup. But it picks up very well. After having bought 2 other smaller vacs in the last year I was almost ready to give up and just use a carpet sweeper or broom. But I'm so glad I don't have to now. This is a great vacuum and I love it."
2,not my first choice,"The CD does not work with Windows 2000. I tried it several times. The book is ok; it has an extensive vocabulary list, which is helpful, and some good tips. But for the analytical and quantitative sections, I recommend another resource."
1,Terrible!!!!,"I had the Eddie Bauer Mercer Intergrated Travel System, which uses this base. This base is awful, and does not secure well at all!! We attempted to install the car seat in 2 different cars, we tried the latch belt and the seat belt but nothing helped. This base is a new narrow base, and it does not hold the car seat properly. Do not waste your money!!! If you compare this base to the other ones such as Graco, Evenflo, Britax, etc., you will see the obvious difference."
1,I agree,"My husband was in love with this car seat. We tried to use it when we came home from the hospital, I had to hold the car seat in place the whole ride home in fear the car seat would tip over with my newborn in the seat. Please don't buy this car seat."
1,Do Not Purchase This BASE,"I am a Child Passenger Tech with SAFE KIDS CHATTANOOGA. We have big issues with this base, myself and the TN Highway Patrol and the local Sheriff Dept along with a rep from the Gov. Highway Safety could not install this seat to work correctly. I did notify NHTSA about our concern with this base. I have complained to the manufactuer in person two weeks ago at the Lifesavers Conference, Austin, TX and expressed to them how poorly designed this base is. It will not stay tight no matter what. I have tried this in several vehicles. The manufactuer told me that they are designing a new one --in the mean time I suggest you return this seat base to the store you purchased it from."
4,Brings back a lot of memories.,"My mom got me this way back when, my copy is pretty dog eared, I read these stories over and over again when I was a kid. If you're a fan of Superman comics, and of a certain age, then this is a good book to have. The only real problem is that I think they should have only included self contained stories, there's a few that were continued, but that's just a minor quibble. Well worth owning for comic book fans."
1,"Horrible...Spoilers, if you can even call them that, within","Going to have to agree with Morloch on this one. So apparently, if Superman was a Union soldier in the civil war, the Union would have won. Pretty mind-blowing, huh? Read this title and you will believe that a man can fly (and then decide to ride a horse into the sky for some odd reason...perhaps a perverse enjoyment of animal cruelty). This comes across like the WWII era propaganda comics, only for a war that's been finished for over a century, so I'm not quite sure what the point is. The art is nice, but the incredibly lame story more than makes up for that. Maybe if we're lucky, we'll get Batman: Runnymede featuring King Bruce Wayne signing the Magna Carta. Worst trade I've ever read, by far."
5,Informative,I found this book to be informative. Much of what has been shared in this book are very similar examples of what I've gone through. I am thankful Monique Brown made her story and experiences available which helped me to know that I am not alone in this. There is help. You can change the outcome of what happens to you as long as you are willing to open your mind and receive.
5,Extremely Helpful!!!,"I brought this item as a gift for someone who was dealing with fibroids. Prior to ordering the book on line, I had the pleasure to review the book as well. It is an excellent and informative book, which is well written. I recommend this book for any women who is dealing with fibroids.Thank you."
5,its a sistah thng,i really enjoy reading this book because it help me understand fibroids and know more about them.
4,Very pretty and well-made,"Simple installation...it only took a small screwdriver to attach the bell's wire to this plate, and then to mount it to the wall. We've had several compliments on this unique piece's addition to our home. It's clearly something special."
2,No Hyperlinks!!!,"I have the hardback version and I absolutely love it! The only book I like more is ""Interconnections"" by Radia Perlman. The two books are a must for any network engineer.However, the Kindle version was a real disappointment because Cisco Press didn't enable hyperlinks in the table of contents which caused me great pain. The search feature worked however I didn't care for it.I'm giving only two stars because the hyperlinks don't work."
4,"A good book, if not a little wordy","Most of this book was considerably helpful. However, I found Doyle's lengthy description of OSPF (170 pages, most of it raw information) too detailed . If I had wanted to read the RFC for OSPF, I would have done so. If he could have separated the basic essentials of OSPF operation from the monotanous details of the protocol, I would have enjoyed the book much more. Instead, the basics of OSPF operation are mixed in with and muddled by ALL of the intricate details of the protocol. (I think he makes this mistake with all of the routing protocols, but the other routing protocols he describes are not nearly as complex as OSPF.) All of that aside, this book still remains one of my favorite and most recommended resources. It should be a member of every IT personel's book collection."
1,this book was too long.,"I couldnt get passed this thing called binary, 1's and 0's? octets? I'm no einstien, but nobody can read this! I give two thums down!"
5,"The ""definitive"" tool for CCIE,CCNP,CCNA,CCIP","I constantly keep this book at my side Wheteher I am teaching ccna students or doing my own CCNP/CCIP stuff and always when I am working on any cisco product. Jeff Doyle presents complex concepts in a straight forward and understandable manner. I am only sorry I waited so long to purchase this and TCP/IP II.Great illustrations,configs,and examples Good Stuff!!Damian Alcaraz CCNA,CCAICabrillo College Computer Science & Cisco Networking Academy Instructor."
2,Great voice... less than great emphasis,"I bought this on recommendation from an audiophile discussion forum. I sampled the tracks before I bought it and I was really excited when I heard that voice....until I received the cd. The voice was wonderful, along with the selections but the emphasis he placed on certain words made the wonderful voice and wonderful choices...really bad for me. Now not everyone enjoys the same styles...which I understand and this one was not for me. Try Chet Baker's ""My funny Valentine"" instead and you will be glad you did. If he changes his emphasis on words (Jimmy Durante is his current style) then I say buy all you can get your hands on...but until then...pass."
3,latino rap rocks,"this c.d wasnt bad at all.at least there trying to keep it real for eazy e.the beats arent bad and now is the time for latino rappers,i strongly recomend you to buy this c.d."
4,better fit,I have been using Trojan Magnum products for years but have always had problems with how tight they fit. The new tapered design is much better because now the only place they are tight on me is at the base where it rolls down. The best part is the reliability of the Trojan name - major Kudos from me!
4,Stop much better than cheap auto parts store junk!,"OVERVIEW: An overall improvement in stopping power over ""premium"" pads from the auto parts store, but not overly grabby and harsh, and so far have been able to take the heat of my spirited driving style.PROS: Great stopping power, low dust, not grabby/jerkish under light braking but surprisingly powerful under moderate to hard braking.CONS: Had to file off some imperfections in the paint to allow proper sliding of the pads in the caliper and bracket.I would definitely purchase again for the front pads on my 1992 Honda Accord EX with Akebono Calipers."
3,Hawk HPS Brake Pads,"I purchased these replacement aftermarket pads on my 2002 Honda Civic because I didn't like the stopping power of the OEM brakes. I heard good reviews about these pads from a friend and on [...]. They weren't what I expected. They can get noisy in the morning when the brake pads are cold and they didn't deliver the performance I expected. Note to self: stick with OEM pads for daily usage and just brake earlier. The car would have been better off if Honda had disc brakes in the rear for that model to begin with, or if you're a wrencher upgrade them from a Civic Si."
1,No fits,"this product not fits in my Honda civic 1994 LX trim, and i bayed because the product details said it fits....VERY BAD DESCRIPTION AND DETAILS....."
5,Six cast commentaries are included,"Season Three is finally here and this time with commentaries.The following episodes will have audio commentary from Brice Beckham, Ilene Graff, Rob Stone & Tracy Wells:-Debut aka Close Call-Kevin's Date-Pills-The Crush-The Competition-Kevin's Older Woman"
1,Very short life span,"I am installing fiber cement siding on my house. I have installed a little less than 400 sqft and am on my third blade. I have been doing 80% of the cuts just on one piece, the other 20% gang cutting 3 pieces at once. The life expectancy appears to be about 50 cuts per blade, then in one cut all of the teeth will burn off the blade. I am now looking for a diamond blade to take its place. Unless you have just a few cuts to make find another blade."
1,BOOT LEG BEAT BITERS,"You know, it is ashame that these bootleg beat biters and soul stealers have to take from the two deceased superheros of rap along with there respective record lables and put this trash out. You never get more then a low quality trash mix and never hear the lyrics at all either. This crap, like when I heard the trash that Trapp put out makes me wanna puke, lick it up and puke again. Nice to see that there are so many leaches in this world that they have to parasite off of Biggie and Pac to make some beans. If it wasnt for the early deaths or the beef they both had, this wouldnt be anything more then trash, just like the bootleg knock offs you find in your local flea market. Hey, if you are a real fan, or just real period, dont spend your hard earned cash on this crap, spend it on the real cds of both artists, especially if you dont have all of Pac's old rides, check them out and Ms Shakur a little of the profit and not these bootleg flea circus fools."
5,A wonderful companion to the BIND book,"Like the BIND book, the DNS and BIND cookbook is an invaluable reference for any DNS/Email/Web admin. This book answers many of the questions raised in the BIND book through numerous illuminating illustrations. It explains the differences between BIND 4, 8 and 9. Plus there's a great section on email and even IPv6The DNS & BIND cook book coupled with the BIND book are truly the BIND bibles."
3,"Little good things here and there, but not enough on BIND9","I bought this book because I saw it had the ""Upgrading to BIND9"" chapter. However I found very little information on how zone files are different in the new version or what advantages BIND9 offeres over its predecessors."
4,Fire Eater,"Set in England, eleven year old Bobby Burns has a lot on his mind. His father is ill and he has just started at a new school. If that is not enough, it is 1962 and the world is on the brink of World War III as Bobby and his family watch the hostilities between the United States and Russia now known as the Cuban Missile Crisis. While out with his mother, Bobby sees the street performer, McNulty the Fire Eater. Bobby is afraid of the big man, yet so fascinated by McNulty's tricks that he seeks him out whenever possible. A precarious bond is formed between the young boy and the Fire Eater. It soon becomes apparent to Bobby that McNulty is both mentally ill and homeless. Almond does a beautiful job portraying the mysterious McNulty as someone to fear yet someone to love and to comfort. Some of McNulty's tricks may not be for the squeamish and the abusive teachers may offend some. Recommended for ages 12+ years old."
1,Not Worth My Time,This book had horribly scattered ideas and no plot. We read this in my book club and no one was very impressed. I forced myself to struggle through this and get it's sleepy pages over with. I thought the book would pick up at the very end but I had no such luck. I slept through it from beginning to end. Some charactors were well formed but most of them including the narrator were completely unbelievable with no distinct personality. I do not know how this book won an award. It was truly a disappointment.
4,Very Nice,"This TV is the next best thing to buying an HDTV. The best tube on the market, you'll definitely be pleased. A little high priced though."
3,Obsolete edition as of Dec 2011,"REVIEW OF KINDLE EDITION (WHICH IS NOT YET THE NEWLY-PUBLISHED VERSION)Absolutely love this book - and would recommend it highly to anyone with a telescope who feels they need a bit of (non-condescending) help finding interesting things to look at. I have also been anxious to download it to my recently-acquired Kindle in order to have it handy while out observing at night.HOWEVER - after waiting on pins and needles for the udpated 2011 edition to be released in November, I finally downloaded to my Kindle on Dec. 26, and discovered to my disappointment that Kindle (so far) only offers the Third Edition, released back in 2000. That's still a great resource, but I had hoped that Amazon would update it by now. (Or at least make it clearer that the print and digital versions are not the same)."
4,Nice book,"This book got so many great reviews I had to buy it. It is a good book for a beginner for finding many targets to view with a small telescope, but I much prefer Night Watch. This is mostly a book to find the very easy targets, not much more. The star charts are very simple and the directions for finding targets will be a great help to a beginner. I just find all the other information and the star charts in Night Watch to be better. However the two books go togeather well."
4,Very Useful for Beginning Astronomers,"I've recently added this book to my collection. I would recommend it for those new to astronomy more so than seasoned amatuers. It's great for learning the night sky and making the most out of your small telescope and/or binoculars. Having only been into the hobby for a year I feel as I have outgrown the book somewhat, and I'm seeking more detailed information. For what it is intended though, it is very good."
3,Not the book for me!,"I am an amateur and bought this book based on the other reviews and ratings given. I was looking for a book to help me locate some of the more interesting night sky objects and this one seemed to be ""the book."" Well, when I got the book, I opened it up and immediately felt a little overwhelmed by all of the text-and I do mean there is a lot of text. More than I wanted. This book just wasn't what I was looking for in a guide to the night sky. Perhaps later on, I will find this book more helpful."
5,Excellent,"Make this the first book you buy for anyone with a telescope. It is user friendly, well written and illustrated, and will ignite a passion for chasing the beautiful objects scattered through the night sky. Also useful is the guide on interesting Southern Hemisphere objects, including those in the LMC and SMC.Highly recommended."
5,The most useful astronomy book ever!,"I have a small 2.4"" refractor that I got for my birthday. I really wanted to see deep sky objects, but I did not know where to look. I saw that Turn Left at Orion was helful to a lot of people. It shows me how to find the object and gives me ratings. I am so glad I bought this book.I do not know what I would do without it! My telescope would probably be collecting dust in my attic. I would reccomend this book to any one with a 2"" telescope or larger. Most things in this book can even be seen with binoculars! I now use my telescope every clear night. You will too, if you discover all the objects in this book! Try it!"
5,One of the first books for anyone looking up at night.,"One of the first books anyone new to looking up at the night with any kind of optics.This book will let you know if you are going to be a 8"" telescope person or a 16"" telescope person or maybe the binoculars are right for you.Turn some lights off world! Save billion's"
5,joyful inspiration,I have enjoyed reading and re-reading this book. The photographs are outstanding images of the beauty that surrounds us in nature and the author's meditations depict so well our human awareness of our dependence on the Almighty.Very worthwhile reading.
3,"Good, but not great","There are some great tracks on this album but two stand out in my mind as best in show. ""2 Take You Away"" is a great mix that dubs Toto's Africa. ""Dreams"" is a great Deep Dish version of that old chestnut by Stevie Nicks. The other stuff -- good filler for a good party."
3,"Great idea, but needs proofreading","This book is based on a great premise. It covers a wide range of scientific ideas that even non-scientists should know. The light touch adds to its charm. However, the proofreading of the illustrations is not good. Several chemical structures were incorrectly drawn, and a few photos had caption errors. This is a serious drawback for a book that seeks to be a reference work. A new, revised edition would be most welcome."
1,"Sadly, this book should not even get 1 star.","1001 Things Everyone Should Know About Science, by James Trefil, is not worth the paper it is printed on. It is edited poorly. Additionally, many of the ""1001 Things"" are out of date and/or incorrect. Clearly, Mr. Trefil should stick to physics and stay far away from anything else, especially being an author."
5,Wolf-Ferrari.The Jewels of the Madonna-From AMAZON,"I heard a portion of The Jewels and decided to acquire a CD. I am very happy that I did. The CD was everything I expected...and more....since there were several other numbers...The School for Fathers, Doctor Cupid, The Backward Woman and Susanna's Secret. I enjoyed them all, and hope to contiue listening to the pieces frequently. Excellent shipping and quick, too."
1,discouraging course,"I have been learning languages for many years and had different kinds of video, DVD language courses. This French 101 is, unfortunately, my biggest disappointment. It's just repetition of vocabulary in a very boring and very slow way which is not effective as much as you expect. I hope I will be able to return it."
1,Dissappointing,Not at all what I expected hard to understand french phrase only said once and once is obviously not enough to hear the pronounciation. The topics are useless and way too long. I was expecting simple phrases such as where why how much please thankyou etc nothing of this. A waste of money as far as I am concerned it will probably end up in the bin.
1,Critical Thinking,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. I wanted to learn about critical thinking. I am a non-traditional college student working on a Masters Degree. I thought this subject would help me in my approach to school and getting an education. I was hoping it would help me in thinking deeper, reasoning, debate, and decision making in each subject I student in Human Resource Management. However, I found the author to be biased and unable to convey the subject in an educational format. Instead, he appears to attempt to inflect his own biased philosophical opinions in this book which I found do not reflect this subject of critical thinking."
1,Do not Buy this Book,This is the worst book I've read on critical thinking and logic. The examples the author uses are terrible....quite dull.
3,Useful resource for sharpening your thinking,"Easy to understand with fun exercises. It's even more enjoyable if read aloud with a friend. The format is a little awkward (turning to the back of the book for certain examples and passages, and yet another section for suggested answers to exercises.) Worth a read."
5,One of the best!,"Though most were about time travel,I liked the FogHorn and Our lady of the saurapods.Though Strata,didn't have anything to do with dinosaurs.But still a great book!"
2,Quality has gone down over the years,I used to use one of these desk mats at an old job 10 years ago and it held up great. The adhesive used to hold together the top clear sheet and the bottom mat stopped working within a week of receipt of this item. So now the top sheet is always misaligned with the mat. This is really annoying and does not serve the purpose of protecting the papers and photos that you have put under the sheet.
5,make sure you get the one with Stitching at the top.,This product that was sold by Amazon has stitching at the top and thus prevents the top from separating from the bottom. other sellers of the same product have only tape keeping the two together. the inferior product fails after a few days of use and separates.
1,Poor construction,"Bought this exact pad from Staples, seeing as how it was about the same price and did not have to pay for shipping. It slips all over the desk surface, won't stay put, and the see through panel on top fell apart after only one week. Like another reviewer, I had had one of these years ago that held up quite well but now it is too poorly made to consider recommending."
1,sucks,"I don't really like this game at all. The game play is choppy, the plot is lacking (basically there is no plot) and it is borring. There are many more shooter games out there that are much better."
2,Fans only!,"KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!This game is old, and it shows. There is no Dual Shock capabilities, and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors. It really looks like it could be a cell phone game. The story is: there is no story. You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time, obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients. This game isn't very creative, or well designed, but it is classic. In the end, and as a fan of the Alien series, I must say DO NOT play this game. It will only alter your perception of the series."
1,One worth passing on,"I bought this game baecause the game front cover looked pretty cool, when i played the game it was anything but. If you want to throw money down on a first person shooter game go ahead but i just want my money back."
2,BORING!!!!,"I bought my PS1 in 1999, and this was the 2nd game I bought. This game is only fun if you cheat. Mainly because it is too boring to spend countless times replaying the same level over and over again to finally advance to the next one and have the exact same objective. Find batteries or some item, then find the mission end door. This wasn't poorly made, by any means. It is a good early FPS, maybe I played it just too late. A definite buy if your an Alien fan though."
5,Great Book,"I thought this was a very good book in all respects,and would recommend it highly to laymen and Clergy."
4,Study Book for The Lore's Prayer,This is a helpful aid in the study of a part of Scripture with which many of us are familiar. The very familiarity of the passage may keep us from thinking about the meanings of its words.
3,welcome addition to the rail building system of games,"Iron Dragon is not as good as Empire Builder, North America Rails or Eurorails, but it's a fun game just the same. I like the extra, underground realm of the Orcs. I also like the magical links between certain cities (similar to Star Trek's worm holes). The reason this game isn't quite as fun as other railbuilding games is, the board doesn't seem to be as even as other boards. It's easier to win if you start in one part of the board than another."
4,Loads of fun with a few new twists,"Fun, new version of Empire Builder with a few new tricks to keep your interest, the fantasy component (not being a real map to real places) made it even more interesting"
1,this charger can break,"This charger came with my Samsung phone and it broke. The phone will not stay on the charger because the tabs that hold the phone broke off. I have to turn it upside-down and place it at a wierd angle to get it to charge. Then, I can't see the charging light. Also the unit is awkwardly large, and you can't talk on your phone while it is charging without holding the whole bulky contraption to your ear (not comfortable or cool!)."
3,Farm Animal Book,The book is really small. Thought it was a bigger book. Otherwise it is okay. Would not recommend buying though.
3,Cute,It could be a great book; but it is so small that it is useless. My kids do not like it and wont be caught using it by mistake. It is way too small and not very interesting. Sorry.
2,super small!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great little book, emphasis on little. Would never had paid the price for this book given its size. You can get a much better deal than what these guys charge. Mostly dissappointed in the price. The description said nothing about the size, and it appeared larger."
5,Baby Magic,"I don't know what it is about this book, but babies LOVE it. It's perfect for babies 5 months and up...easy to hold, easy to turn the pages, ok to gnaw on a little. The pictures are simple and clear. It's short on words, but inevitably you get into the animal sounds and talking about the animals and what they do. I include this with all baby shower gifts as a decoration to the top of the gift and my friends have all reported that their babies love this little gem.Of all of the books my girls have loved to death, this is the only one I've actually gone out and bought again and again. It's a must have."
3,Cute,"This is a cute little book and a nice size for a toddler to tote around. It is not one of my toddler's favorites and I have seen much better animal books, but it's still sweet."
4,The time to be Happy is Now,I have purchased several copies of this book to give as gifts and one for myself. It is full of inspirational quotes that I have enjoyed and so have those who received them.
2,Uninspiring..,"Dianne Hubka has a nice tonal quality in her voice and she is a competent singer, but her renditions of these popular tunes are less than inspiring. There is no heart or soul in this CD."
5,Another great OXO product,Love it. Fits nicely in our shaker and strains our cocktails perfectly. Love how it doesn't have a long handle. A must have!
5,Five Stars Easy!,"Nice quality and great feel to the metal, the finger rest and goes great with my brushed stainless shaker. I bought two, one to keep at my bar and one to bring along to parties. This is a quality item. I've even tossed it around a bit, either in the drawer or in my condiment bag and the springs are not bent or disfigured. Fine product for the price. I love the compact handle, too, not like one of those with a 6"" handle at the end that you don't know what to do with. Five stars easily!"
3,"Bonny is better, OXO spring is too small","My only problem with the OXO strainer is that the spring is too small and does not fit securely on any of my boston shakers. This isn't so much of a problem if the shift is slow, but when i have to move fast it gets really annoying when the strainer does not sit properly on my boston shakers.With the exception of the spring, the design is great, and strains well.Go with the Bonny cocktail strainer instead if you're looking to spend this type of money on a hawthorne. SAME EXACT DESIGN but with a larger spring that allows a more secure fit."
5,"Good strainer, good value.","This strainer is very good. The size is great, easy to use, and the quality is very good. You'll get a very good strainer for the price. You won't go wrong with this product.I'm buying a second one to put in a little portable bar kit that I'm putting together when I travel."
3,The world for more space,"I purchased this jointer for a shop with limited space. It is definitely easily portable and easy to set up. The fence is a bit tough to get square, but once you get it there it will stay. The biggest problem with this jointer is the size. If you have the space, buy a floor model with a longer bed. This one is good for small boards only, especially if you are edge jointing. Anything over about 2ft runs off the outfeed table and can introduce a subtle bowl shape to your edge. Eventhough I would have no place to put it, I wish I had bought a bigger machine."
2,Not a good investment,"I bought this jointer and have used it for over a year. Bottom line is it is just to small. When you start taking woodworking more seriously, you will shop for a larger model, like I am now. The infeed/outfeed tables are too small, and unless you know you will never be jointing anything longer than 2 feet, I would spend a little more...and you can get a decent sized model. Other than the size, I don't have any specific complaints except that the dust collection hook up is not included, hard to find, and a bit expensive, but that is another story."
4,Great Tool,I am a weekend woodworker. This is a great jointer. It leaves a great edge. I plane boards as long as 8 feet with no problems. The tables are a little short but for the price it can't be beat!
4,This tool works.,"This one man's experience is that the tool works fine. It joints and planes small boards, square. I could blame it for not being more massive, just as I could blame it for not being a hammer or a television. It took 1/2 hour to get up and running, including setting the fence to exactly 90 degrees. It's fairly lightweight and can easily be stored on a shelf in my garage. I check the fence each time I use it but I've never had to adjust it again since day one. I have made several pieces of fine furniture with this jointer, a bench-top Makita saw in a Rousseau table, a bench-top Delta planer, a bench-top Bench Dog router table, a simple Dewalt miter saw and a bench-top drill press, along with hand tools. Any deficiency in my creations must be blamed on my lack of skill and creativity, as these tools do their job correctly. Will it joint long boards or chill your beer: No."
2,Save your money and get a floor model,"I would not recommend buying this unit. I didn't get around to using it until after the return date had expired, otherwise I would have returned it in a heartbeat. It's not a great tool if you plan on becoming a serious woodworker. It took me forever to get the fence square to the table. Also, the fence is very flimsy. It can easily be deflected over an 1/8"" no matter how hard you tighten it down. Once I got the fence as square as possible I was able to edge glue some 12"" boards with an almost imperceptible glue line. If you plan on gluing up boards much longer than 12 to 18 inches you will definitely not be happy with this unit. I tested the Jet 6"" at my local Woodcraft store, what a difference. I hope I can sell the Delta and get the Jet."
1,"Delta 6"" Wood Chipper","If you're in the market for a wood chipper the 37-070 is a great addtion to your shop. This product was not intended for jointing pieces that you intend to use in your projects.Don't make the investment. Purchase a real jointer.Tried changing the knives. The screws were welded in. Ended up having to purchase a new cutter head, knives, screwes."
1,DO NOT BUY,I gave it one star becuase Zero was not an option!I plead with you not to waste your money on this Jointer. The fence adjustment construction is unstable and the fence wobbles giving you out of square cuts every time.Maybe I'll use mine as a food processor!Delta makes great products but they missed the boat on this one. Spend a little more on a floor model.
3,Don't even think about long boards,"While the quality of this tool has turned out to be ok, it's really far too small for boards longer than about 2'. It's next to impossible for me to get boards flat with this jointer. Proper technique says you want the concave side down, but the bed is so short that you can't really do that and get a good surface. Spend the extra money and get one with a longer bed. It's a bit loud, but plenty powerful."
2,Plus and minus...,"On the plus side: Inexpensive, easy to set up, left a smooth finish on black walnut. On the minus side: Smooth, yes, but NOT STRAIGHT!...there was a 1/8-inch bow left in the center of 40-inch stock. ...And that negates the main purpose of a jointer. I'm returning mine and buying a jointer which has a longer bed, by another mfgr."
2,Only for 2 foot long boards,"Don't buy this jointer if you plan to run boards longer than 2 feet. However, if you are cramped for room in your shop this tool is very light and compactThe fence adjusment assembly is poorly constructed and required some filing smooth of the cast aluminum. Bottom line, you get what you pay for."
2,Get a floor model instead.,"The unit is too small for doing the types of projects that make you want to buy a jointer in the first place.I ran four-quarter cherry through the jointer and the cut was clean, but my 4ft. long boards ended up slightly concave - with the middle offset by 1/16"" from the ends. Not much, but enough to be frustrating when you're trying to square up boards to glue-up. I made sure I started with the bowed side down. I went on a mission and researched every online woodworking article to make sure I was using proper technique, compensation, etc. and still couldn't manage any better than the 1/16"" offset.The positive: It sets up fast and easy with clear instructions. It's small and can be tucked away when not in use.I bought this unit as a companion for my 12 1/2"" planer, but ended up returning it.My recommendation is that if you're looking at this unit because of cost, then look for a used floor model instead."
5,The best y2k kit I've seen. It clearly tells it all.,"This is more than a video. It is a total preparedness kit with the extensive workbook included.As Robert Stack says ""everyone should see it.Congratulations on carrying it !"
2,Not so impressed,I bought the underwater case and the first time I took it with me for snorkeling I noticed some tiny cracks in the case afterwards. The camera wasn't lying in direct sun exposure nor was the water particularly cold. I had a disposable underwater camera with me as I wanted to make sure that if I don't get the digital camera to work in my first time snorkeling I could take some picture. The disposable camera was perfectly fine after my snorkeling trip so I think I had some bad luck with the underwater case. Unfortunately there is no warranty on this product so I have to hope the cracks will stay as tiny as they are. Still I am not very impressed about the quality.
5,Great watertight case for a great compact camera,"Compact, sturdy, well engineered. Easy-to-manipulate controls. Thoughtful flash diffuser. Beefy silicon o-ring should last a long time. External mount will come in handy for tripod usage. Love the $150 price and free shipping with Amazon."
4,I enjoyed this one a bit more,"I haven't been too involved with this one yet, other than it being Clamp, but this volume was better because it's starting to heat up some. Love the kitties & there's lots of chibi action as Kohaku & Shuichiro head to an amusement park only to be tailed by Koryu with a potion that shrinks Kohaku to chibi form for a day. The whole mystery behind Shuichiro's gets a bit extreme as every time Kokuyo tries to tell someone, something interrupts. It was cute seeing Usyagi captured & caged in a mild rebellion to keep Kohaku at Shuichiro's, but returning her to heaven allows a bit more development since we get to see what such a bubblehead does & why she's soooo important(& why God's going to be upset at that next bridge meeting) & it also allows the aloof Shuichiro to realize how much the angel means to him."
4,Your Wish is Granted.,"If you like drama, volume 3 of Wish is full of it. Albeit, it's mainly drama from Kohaku, but it just would suit Shuichiro's character if he were too overtly worried about his favorite air-headed angel. Also, there are two bonus stories which bring us full circle as to just how Shuichiro found Kohaku being tormented by that crow (Koryu sent it after her just to make her squirm when he was in disguise on Earth.) and also how Hisui and Kokuyo got together.Spoiler Alert(!): The ""earring"" on Hisui's left ear is actually Kokuyo's left eye, hence why he says that sunlight only effects his right eye."
5,watch a real syperman live!,"Good,excellent,superb,supirior.this is the real Taichi, performed and explained by the grandmaster himself,moving like swalows,beautiful like a swan.what can one say?Good quality video and cover. The only pity,if you dont speak Chinese is,that it takes a long time to play,reading the English subtitles,step by step,with pausing in between. It'd be a great help to have a spoken translation."
4,"Good Book, But Not a History","I give this book four stars. It is a fascinating investigation into the political and cultural environment in France that led up to the revolution.But be forewarned! This book is NOT a history of the revolution. The author makes that very clear right at the beginning, but I think it bears emphasizing. If you aren't already pretty familiar with the history of the revolution you may have trouble at times following what this book is talking about.Overall, this book is well worth the cover price for anyone with an interest in the French revolution."
5,It's Tocqueville. What More Can I Say?,"A fascinating, thorough, and in-depth analysis of the French Revolution. A must-read for any history student."
5,Joachim Raff,"Joachim Raff .... the first time I heard his melodies I was a boy listening to Mischa Elman play Raff's 'Cavatina'. I knew right away this man had a gift for beautiful melody. The truth is borne out in his symphonies 3 and 5. History has not been kind to Raff, but without cause. His music is wonderful and more conductors should reinsert him into their programs. He deserves to be placed up near the best instead of being forgotten."
5,Perfect Product,"If you don't want to overpay at the dealership, this is the way to go. Exact fit and function, for much less. Look for the do it yourself video on YouTube. The installation is relatively easy, but you need a flash light, a quiet location, and a bit of patience. The product is perfect."
3,Liberty Coming of Age,"This book is not for the serious history buff nor for those who are seeking a macro view of historical events. But what this book does provide is the insite into an individual solder's life during our darkest hour. Other books on the Revolutionary War delve deep into the problems faced by Washington when the initial 6-month enlistments were to expire. Those Continental Troops who did not re-up are now viewed with scorn. However, Joseph was one of those troops who left after his enlistment was up and returned home without regret. The viewpoint from this individual solder provides balance from those Officers who were sustained in relative comfort. However, one has to begin to question some of the stories such as seeing Molly Pitcher in battle and his personal meeting with General Washinton near Yorktown. Regardless of the accuracy of his saga, Yankee Doodle Boy is easy reading and adds a sense of what it was really like to battle fatigue as much as the redcoats."
1,distortion of facts,"This book should be listed as fiction since it is so full of errors, misrepresentation of the facts, and elimination of much of the real evidence. Krueger is either a deliberate liar and in some way connected with the murders or prefers fiction to fact."
3,Disappointed!,"I purchased this and sent a e prior to see if it had a plastic or the velcro band, I could not see in the picture, and never receive a reply. So I purchased it and hoped it was not the velcro, but it was. I asked if I could return it and get another watch with the rubber band and never received a response. So now I have a watch I can't wear. I can't risk a rash from it. Very disappointing......"
4,Better than it looks!,"From the cover I expected a fluffy rehash of game desktop wallpapers. Instead, it's packed with lots of great, technical information about the creation of game graphics! Highly recommended for aspiring 3d artists."
4,"Crush, or Be Crushed!","After buying and returning the ""Dukes of Hazzard"", i was a bit skeptical to remove ""Driver"" from my Playstation console, but DEMOLITION RACER is a very cool game! The steering, handling and visual effects are excellent! Being able to customize the paint on the car in this game is an awesome option too! Each track has its own characteristics, but my favorite is the ""Parking Lot"". There's nothing like the feel of concrete and rubber especially when you clock the leader of the pack in the side with a high-velocity, crunching hit!"
4,"Very good, but not as good as the Keystone CDs","It's great that these old tapes are being put out on CD. The sound quality is very good and the playing is top rate as well. This selection is very good but does not measure up the the Keystone discs with Merl. The music is energetic enough, but the slower tunes and blues songs don't sway and move me. The guitar solos are good, but are not as emotional as fans have come to expect on the Keystone series. I'm being tougher in the comments because there seems to be a tendency among GD and Garcia reviewers to say everyting is the best as long as Jerry's voice isn't cracking and the sound quality is pretty good. With that said. this gets 4 stars based on how it stands alone and not in comparison to other great Garcia discs."
3,Disappointing,"Eh. I had high hopes for this one (having never heard the tapes), with the sax player in the band and the word ""jazzy"" used in all the hype. It's just OK, and it's not ""jazzy"" at all--this is basically a blues band. The sax player--instantly recognizable as the honker on the original studio version of Music Never Stopped--pretty much sucks. Why is it that in any rock band with a saxophonist, the sax is the weak link (yes, I include the E St. Band)? He adds nothing of interest, gets in Jerry's way pretty often, is out of tune most of the time, and keeps playing (at whim) through a wah-wah effect that makes him sound like a singing AFLAC duck. Jerry plays pretty well, but he hits a lot of clams on Melody and never really blows me away (as his playing often does). *shrug*"
1,Least helpful of all SCI books,This book quickly made it to my discard pile. It is full of speculative information from the outside by able bodied professionals who are clueless about the day to day reality of SCI. I would not recommend this book as a useful reference for anyone affected by SCI.
5,Great fun and fantastic fidelity.,"I thoroughly enjoyed everything on this disc. Concerto for Jazz Band was exciting, and the phonics outstanding, even on my Sansa Clip + I kept looking around for the sound of an instrument, mistaking it for the real thing, the feeling of space was so pronounced. This is my first try with Liebermann. Looking forward to more from him. Naxos continues to shine with great sounding CDs."
3,Artwork is amazing - but is it really sacred?,"I was disappointed to learn that the inspiration for Alex's art comes to him through LSD trips. I have seen the walls breathing on an LSD trip and it doesn't mean that they really do, or that it was sacred. Still, his artwork is amazing and the DVD is really well produced. And maybe, as I thought on my LSD trip, that THAT state was reality, and normal mental state is not."
5,Ian Svenonius is the new James Brown (or Prince?) . . . .,"The lead singer of the Make Up, Ian Svenonius, is the new James Brown (or Prince?). When he sceams 'Owww! ', you'd swear it was Prince, circa ""Purple Rain"". His voice is wonderfully raw and strong - I can easily imagine the band live. The songs themselves are excellent gems of beat, bass and keyboard - they 'groove' in a deep, delightful way. This CD is a great lead-in to their latest release, ""Save Yourself"". Quite simply, the Make-up are groovy!"
2,"Musically interesting, vocally repelling","A guy I work with was playing this CD last night and I was struck by how interesting the music was. An awkward white-boy funk that falls somewhere between the Dead Milkmen and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The keyboards add an especially unique sound. If this were an all-instrumental band, I'd enjoy it quite a bit.The problem is, the lead singer sounds like a strangled cat. His idea of getting his emotions out is by squealing and screaming at piercing levels. He has no soul...not in the musical sense, anyway. I laughed when I read the reviews comparing him to Prince and James Brown. Puh-leeze. I can appreciate lo-fi garage, but this is ridiculous.Two stars for the music, negative stars for the vocals. Fire the lead singer and regroup."
5,I'd give this album more stars if they'd let me!,"The album is the bible to mod rock. The lyrics are catchy and they preach to the listening audience. If you own any of the Make-Up's older CD's you will be blown away by this album. The band has progressed from a raw beat-punk sound to a collective gospel soul. The use of organ-like keyboard effects, soulful bass and the voice of the preacher are amazing."
1,I Want Some,"...I want some (or all) of my money back. I can't possibly fathom why Ian Svenonious has been compared to James Brown or Prince. His weak, strangeled vocals are exceedingly irritating- he has no lung power. He sounds like an anemic white guy doing a bad impersonation (karyoke-style) of someone with soul. Make-up is one of a slew of bands expirementing with juxtaposing several seemingly disparate music styles ( in their case psychedelic pop/gospel/R&B- others have claimed that there is punk in there too but I can't find it) for kitsch value. For some bands it works (like early Blues Explosion) but this Make-up doesn't blend and you're left with base face. They are a novelty group that is far too contrived and image concerned to even be amusing. In other words, hipsters will most likely lap this up but be forewarned if you are not just looking for the next buzzword band."
3,great toy for a 5.5 year old girl,we started with the mini set and my daughter enjoyed them so much that i got her the bigger one. she pulls it out every time with the minis and has a car parade. the pink one is also used for doll parades. there are so many different combinations and even with constant pulling on and off and reassembling the cars have helped up really well. i'm planning to get a couple more for her car rally.
1,What a rip off,"We bought this after a restaurant gave my daughter one of these to use while she was there and ended up loving it. The photo shows 4 sippy cups but when I got the order, I only got one in blue. I did not get to choose the color and the item is made of a plastic that is one step above disposable cups. $12 is a total rip off for what this is. $12 would have been reasonable for a set of 4 but not a single cup. The restaurant would have sold it to me for $5, oh well. Had my wife not opened it and let my daughter use it, I would have returned it."
5,An excellent poet,"This book is filled with feeling! So Strong , So Sad, So Funny and So Right On!!!!!I highly recommend it----- As well as his other books. His soul is old and he truly speaks for the Indian."
3,Thornguard leather gloves,"The gloves were inexpensive, comfortable, and attractive, but ripped the third time I wore them. I do some heavy gardening, and while these gloves would protect the hands of someone doing lightweight gardening chores and pruning, they are not strong enough to handle harder chores such as transplanting an established plant. Also, the material they are made from does not breathe, and in the humid South (even in our lower humidity winters), my hands sweat profusely, dampening the leather palms from the inside out. These are a good purchase for a gardener who needs protection from thorns, brambles, etc. and whose gardening chores are minimal. For someone who needs to protect hard-working hands in the garden, these are a poor choice."
4,great garden gloves,My wife loves these gloves!Long enough to guard your for armsNo thorns get through!She loves them
2,The publishers must be the ones who are desperate,"This is the story of the world war two voyage of a fictional merchant ship with a dangerous cargo of industrial alcohol and six mysterious American passengers. The ""Rosa Dartle"" is not a happy ship - in fact it's a positively dysfunctional one. Storms, U-boats and the Luftwaffe are the ingredients added to simmering internal dissention.And yet the pot never quite seems to come to the boil. There are too many characters, and at only about 75,000 words there isn't enough space to fully develop all of them into people you can care about. The storylines are clever, but most of them are very casually resolved.The real story is why this simple tale, first published in 1961, should suddenly be reprinted in 2000. It's not a dire story by any means, but surely there must be better new submissions coming in?"
4,Very elegant,"This ring was a pleasant surprise for the price. It looks sturdy but dainty. the pearl is not overly sized. The band is georgous. I noticed a stripping of the pearl in the first few days but that was obviously the protective film, as what lies underneath is still shiny and pearly. I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because the sellers should state what type of pearl it is. I think its simulated but I am not sure. I am thinking about buying one more for a gift. Good work Nvie and your delivery time and customer service is commendable."
3,fun activities,"My kids love the activities and look forward to our ""family time"". I like how the verse is connected to the activity. It gives our family an opportunity to share how we feel about eachother and what God is doing in our family. I do however, have to take bit more time explaining how the activity relates to our family and God, but my kids are younger and their attention wanders after the activity is over. I think the content is perfect for elementary age kids!"
4,Fun For Kids,"Are you tired of trying to come up with money, in order to get away and spend time with your kids? In 52 Family Time Ideas, Smith helps parents stay home, save money, and cherish their time together. Each section includes a Biblical verse, questions to cause family members to speak to one another, and a game--from household items--to help family members laugh and play together. While the book is designed for children under 14 years, there's a small section to show how to convert each activity so teenagers will take part."
1,nice guy - awful market timer,"I used to listen to the Tom O'Brien show and used to subscribe to his newsletter. I admit I enjoyed his show but his newsletter lost me a lot of money. He is a nice guy and he produces an enjoyable radio program. The big problem is that neither his radio show, his book nor his newsletter is going to make you money. He is an awful market timer. He has been bearish for most of time since March of 2009. Check it out for yourself - subscribe to his chat room and you will find out how poor his timing is. Also, over the years his radio show has become more of a sales pitch for all the services they offer."
3,Solid Stuff,"Overall I recommended it based on what it teaches on volume alone. I'm not a fan of the rest of the stuff, but all part-time investors should take a look at this book. I never really paid that much attention to volume before reading this book. Now its always on my screen. This book is not for daytraders. This is a book with helpful technicals that will help you once you decide to buy a stock. Say you found a company you like. Then use what this book suggests to move forward. Do not expect the holy grail, but expect simple techniques that investors need. If you are not full-time working in the financial industry and invest in the market as savings then all you need a firm understanding of fundamental analysis (accounts, strategy, growth expectation, price) and this book. If you have some financial background then if you already use volume then don't buy this book. Just look into Market Profile."
2,Nothing New,"I thought that the book was easy to understand, but I did not find it particulary helpful. I think there are better books for most of the areas covered e.g. fibonacci, candlesticks, volume etc. Might be okay as a beginning primer, but I think there are better books for the money."
3,Timing the Trade,"I thought this was a pretty good book. It did not go into great depth in any one area when TA was discussed, but did a good job focusing on some fairly important trading philosophies as to when to enter a trade and when to get out and paying attention to volume as a confirmation tool. I thought it was a good book especially if you are fairly new to trading, for the experienced trader it did not offer as much although it did reinforce some important trading ""rules"". I liked in particular the chapters concerning Confluence & Jumping the Creek, Coming back to Ice."
5,A great manual on how to trade markets.,"I found Timing The Trade to be a very well written, clear and concise work.O' Briens's trading method uses volume and fibonacci techniques to create an easy to follow system in plain english and the book's conversational style is a joy to read.The author has created a book which addresses all parts of a trade using his system amongst many other things you will learn :-(i) How to find a setup for entry(ii) How to define the risk/reward in the prospective trade(iii) How to define your plan to exit (in a win or lose situation)in short an illustrated manual of how to plan the trade and then trade the plan.An excellent book that uses a 'hands on' approach to guide you through the market maze."
3,Overrated and Overpriced,"I purchased the book after reading the great reviews this book received here on Amazon. Information provided is precise, clear and OK quality. But definitely not worth the money. May be OK for newbies. Experienced traders would already know most of what is there in the book.PK"
2,Does Delta have a QC department?,"I just received my jointer, and have never received any tool with as terrible of a finish as this Delta tool. I have had problems with my Platinum Pro bandsaw as well, with all pulleys being covered in rust, and the case beat to hell. The jointer is missing paint in several spots, there are scratches all over the stand, and the pulley guard was cracked in half. I can't believe this tool was shipped out. Delta tells me that when they merged with PC, several Delta employees lost their jobs, and they purposely damaged tools. Do yourself a favor and buy the Jet, as it gets great reviews on its fit and finish..."
1,Sent two back-going with the jet,"I got the delta 37-195 as a x-mas present to myself. I got it a couple of weeks before x-mas, set it up and could not get the fence square to the table. I called amazon got return postage and ordered another. I got my second one set it up and if the fence was square by the blade it was not square at the ends. I called amazon again and they are going to send me return postage on the second one and I am going to get the jet. Amazon customer service is great delta jointer is not."
1,You talked me out of buying it,"I have been contemplating purchase a 6 inch jointer for the past month. I had narrowed my decision down to a Jet or a Delta.After reading the 20+ reviews of the Delta on this site, I have concluded that I will NOT purchase a Delta Model 37-195 under ANY circumstances. It sounds like Delta has sacrificed quailty for price. And it sounds like Delta doesn't know the meaning of the words ""Customer Service"". Thank you all very much for your frank experiences with the Delta Jointer. Now I am on to the Jet Jointer page to see what everyone has to say about them"
4,Delta Jointer,"I am in general pleased with the performance of this jointer, for the price, but have had some assembly issues. With the motor pully all the way on, the cutter pulley backed off slightly, and the motor pushed completely against the front of the base, the two pulleys are still not alligned by about 1/8 inch. No big deal probably, but I think the motor may be welded to the brackets wrong. Or perhaps an issue due to the Chinese top and US base.I had no issues with fence or table straigtness.I had planned to use outside and 'let the chips fall where they may' but have found the chips back up in the chute. This machine requires a proper dust collector...."
4,WOW What A Machine,"I recieved my new jointer today and assembled it this afternoon. I found the instructions easy to follow and adjustments were easy to make to. I've tried to save money by buying used eguipment but found something as important as a jointner needs to be new or near new. The only thing I found that I didn't like is the plastic parts. The tighting handles are plastic and I'm worried that they might break in time. Another pert was the switch, or at least the part of it where the bolt went through to mount it. There needs to be a warning about over tighting or redesign it so the mounting section is metal. I'm looking forward to my next project to give it a real test."
2,Fence Biggest Drawback,"If it were not for the cheap, cast aluminum fence I would recommend this. I think if you search enough you'll see that this is the single biggest complaint about this.Suggestion: hold off until you can afford the next Delta model up (I believe that is the 360). It may be 2X the price, but well worth it. Also, the Ridgid is an outstanding buy at $399.00."
4,"Setup problem, but solid equipment",I had a setup problem aligning the motor and cutter head pulleys. After a call to Delta they had me flip the cutter head pulley to bring it into alignment: easier said than done...I hadto heat it with a blowtorch to get it off the spindle. But once setup was done it is a solid piece of equipment.
5,Delta Jointer,"Great machine. However, I did read all the reviews and I was concerned with the fence and table being square. Normally I would have no trouble buying tools on line, but in this case I decided to buy it local. I even took it one step further and bought the floor model. I was able to verify squareness before I bought the machine, plus I had no set up time!"
3,"ok lamp for price, but gets hot quickly","so, it's a cheap lamp so I can't say there was much expectation, so long as it was function. The only thing I would point out that it gets almost dangerously hot such that I turn it off concerned that it might melt, explode etc."
3,OK....,"The lamp it is just Ok. Could be nicer though doesn't look very stylish, and it is kind of big. Not recommended."
4,Basic light cheap,"This is a great basic light cheap. A little top heavy when using CFLs in it but not bad. I'm using several of these pointed up at the walls for indirect lighting, so they look a bit fashionable on a budget."
1,Horrible Radio,"It has absolutely no front end filters. All the noise existing around penetrates it. In the result, it receives noise, not signal. Strong chugging when you try to scan with the side tuning wheel.Strangely enough, Sony takes off production decent world band models, but keeps making this kind of overpriced trash.It would be a barely acceptable value at $30-$40, not at its current price. Buy instead incomparably better radios from Degen/Kaito, models 1102 and 1103. 1103 has an electronic needle scale blowing away that of SW40, and it is a competently engineered and very well finished radio. Its tuning works almost as smooth as that of an analog receiver. It also costs less than a half of SW40."
3,"Odd entry from Sony ...Not bad, nice tuner","Hello folks , its Vince the radioman . I have been a collector and buff for many years and I love to do compares . This is an odd radio . Its digital with an analog feel , not really . It has a very strange display window that is supposed to act like an analog dial . I find all the window data very hard to read. The radio's good points are that it is light weight and the Sony tuner is always the best part of the Sony radio product . The sound quality is only fair both from the built in speaker and the phones. There is no external antenna jack , for this price there should have been one. I find the controls a little overly sensative and the radio seems to have a mind of its own ( changes stations sometimes at will)....but , I will say again the tuner is very good . Buy it if you get a sale only!"
1,Not for use in U.S.A. apparently,"Bought for a birthday gift, this radio has been relegated to storage. The literature packaged with the ""short-wave radio"" has information for use in almost every country on the globe except the U.S. Too expensive for use as an AM/FM radio, we already have several of those. Unless the manufacturers can come up with specific instructions for use in the ""lower 48"" I would not recommend this item."
3,Pretty fine...,"First of all, you need to know I'm picky as heck. I look at swing discs to dance to... not just listen. This one has one of the best selections of tracks of any Swing compilations out there, but still misses the mark at collecting a rack of songs that work together to maintain a tempo that is consistantly danceable. Best I've seen, put you can probably mix a better disc/tape using a couple of discs like this. Good for your collection, but not great on its own."
4,los rieleros del norte rock,i really think this is a good cd.los rieleros del note are the best .they sing about allmexican life and how its like.theres like a song that goes to at least someone whos listening.les recomiendo este disco a todos.
2,Slow Food-Half Baked,"If you are looking for an inspiring read about the slow food movement look elsewhere. This book though short should have been much shorter, possibly a magazine article, and would have been served well by an editor with a deft hand in the kitchen. This tough old roast should have been better trimmed of fat, less excessively salted with pompous and sometimes anti-American asides, peppered more frequently with inspiring attitudes about food cooked slowly and with care instead of platitudes about the superiority of the authors mindset and presented without the cheese. This book serves up bombast like it was beluga caviar and would put someone who is being introduced to the slow food movement off their feed. Pass on this and get the latest edition ofBest Food Writing 2008instead. Your sensuous feast with a hot Mediterranean lover has turned out to be more baloney than bolognese."
3,To elitist for my taste,"Its a decent book but is way to elitist for my taste. Read the back cover and whose quoted? High priced foodies like Mario Batali, who has a show on the FoodNetwork and overpriced cookware and other goods he hawks for big bucks. What's slow about that? Or Robert Mondavi and Michael Romano of the Union Square Cafe, both upscale people. And that's the rub with me. Slow Food seems to be yet another snob idea.Talk to those of us who have been authentic slow food folk for decades who have been teased by the upscale crowd because we have vegetable gardens rather than 7k sq foot homes. Mocked because we cook in crock pots or make home cooked meals where the whole family sits down to eat every night. Folks who don't drive Mercedes, but beat up old trucks that carry feed to out chickens, goats and Guernsey cows.So who may benefit from the book? Beats me. Slow Food in my opinion is just the newest fad that most who read the book may try but wont stick with. Which is sad."
3,"Ok, but no late breaking news","If I had the choice I would not buy this DVD again. All the information on the DVD is available on the net for free. The first video was well done. The second DVD was ok, but I have to say the guy doing the stretches is a little wierd. All in all, if you know nothing about plantar fasciitis then this DVD is not too bad, but if you have already researched no need for the DVD. I was hoping for some additional information but none to be found."
5,i was actually laughing out loud!,"This book is so funny that i actually read in it about 2 and 1/2 hrs, i just couldn't put in down. Thacker's humour is awesome and i can't wait to read his next book. If you need a book for a plane trip...or anything really, grab this one!"
2,Poor humor,"After 2 hours of reading about people drinking and puking and ""bonking"" you have had enough. Sprinkled in with the gross stuff, are some interesting comments about the landscape and countries they have been in. However, why does he insist on describing every moment someone has to throw up. I also wish he would have skipped the entire section on Amsterdam. Not funny."
1,Not for me.,"If you like crude humor this book is for you. After reading a dozen pages, the only thing I got out of it was I was never going to use his tour company if I ever go to Europe."
5,Hysterical laughs from this retired road warrior,"I spent 2 years traveling all over the globe, and Thacker's stories are some of the funniest I have ever heard. This is a non-stop laugh-a-page book, and your insides will hurt afterward from all the stories. True blue Aussie humor, and a great read over and over!!!!"
2,DOPE CD - BUT I DON'T NEED IT..NOT GONNA WASTE MY MONEY..,"Like the last reviewer before me (from Chigago), I'm not going to buy dis joint. I have bought High School High Soundtrack, Killarmy albums, Heltah Skeltah albums, GZA album, Mobb Deep albums, Raekwon album, Tha Alkaholiks album..etc..So why should i buy this?! C'mon Wu, hit us wit da new joints, f*** this moneymakin', yo ODB said dat Wu is 4 the children!! Like my man from Chigago said, SUPPORT DA UNDAGROUND HIPHOP!!...COMPANY FLOW, HIEROGLYPHICS etc..Their keepin it REAL! Wu is good, but ya know..Their doin' it 4 da money!! (Wu is like Master P & Puff: money talks & Bull$#!t walks) Hopefully Wu goes back to their Shaolin roots wit da Rebel INS joint. But anyway Killarmy is da REALEST Wu-Tang $#!+ EVER..Also prepare to face Remedy, D.S.A. & A.I.G. from the Wu-Tang Family. I really hope that 'em iz keepin it dirty n real, not tryin to moneyappeal..."
1,"Good music, waste of money - DONT BUY IT","Yeah, this album has PREVIOUSLY RELEASED material, and, frankly, I have given the ""Wu"" enough of my MONEY to buy an album of music I already have. Alot of these tracks are 4-5 years old! Just another ploy from the ""Wu"" to get more money without putting any effort in to their music. The music on the album was clearly from their glory days, which are long gone. I guess the album can be a tribute to what talent and motivation they used to have. That goes for Mobb Deep, too, who bombed on their last album from lack of effort.In short, if you are a NEWBIE who is on the Wu bandwagon, yeah, go ahead, buy this sh*t. You already slept on these jams when u were too busy listening to Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana. But you are better off supporting ""underground"" artists like the BEATNUTS. Buy their albums. Wu got way TOO much money not to be motivated anymore. Peace."
5,"rullah zig zag zigallah, plus allah, zig zag zig, we addin","more knowledge to your wig. The songs with AZ and Ras Kass are treats and then getting The What, and the first two bangers from Genius' and Rae's albums respectively, plus the demo song and the cold world remix, and the jams with heltah skeltah, cocoa brovas and alkoholiks which were all dope and this is just a slamming compilation. you cant go wrong with this album, period. I figure if youre getting wu people from others' albums, though, not getting Pac's Got My Mind Made Up w/perhaps my favorite Meth vers ever was too bad, but you can't get everything, just think how many damn songs these guys have all made now, and they came out w. protect yr neck just 6 years back!"
5,THIS COLLECTION IS ALREADY A LEGEND,"My basic interest is in 60s rock and british invasion. I do like to hear their influences of course. This awesome collection is a must for any fan of Muddy, Wolf, Otis Rush, Robert Johnson, Little Walter, although the music is more in the doo wop style than blues. The amazing thing about James Brown is that he wrote all these songs. This collection properly captures what a mega-giant he was. If Zep and Clapton fans lionize Muddy and Johnson, Zappa fans need to look to James Brown."
4,"For Better, for Worse, Forever","This book is about a young teenage girl named April Lancaster who is severely devastated with the loss of her beloved boyfriend Mark Gianni. April's parents decide to take a vacation to the Island of St. Croix to get her mind off things. One day when April was taking a walk on the beach she caught the eye of a young man, 18 year old Brandon Benedict. April soon finds out that shes not the only one who had to deal with the loss of a loved one. Brandon recently had to deal with his mothers suicide. Both April and Brandon become very close but, April cannot bring up the courage to tell Brandon about her medical problems. April has cancer. Suddenly April's painfull headaches return and her and her family right away fly back to New York. Leaving a lonley and grieving Brandon behind. April is dying. The question is, Will she be able to tell Brandon that he may eventually lose another person that he truly loves and cares for?"
3,"good read, but...","i am a major f Lurlene fan and this is another great book, but i dislike it because in the first of the 2 books, Till death do us part, april falls in love with mark. In the 2nd, to get over marks death, she goes on vacation to an island in the bahamas to get over the death of mark and meets brandon. yep, you gessed it, they fall in love. i love brandons character,, but mark and april were co in love. just weeks after marks dreath, aprilis not going to fall for another guy. i love the book, but, i hate the way mark and aprils love is down played."
3,I can't really say if it's good or bad....,but I feel very depressed after reading this book! hippo books sent me this book by mistake and so I decided to read it. What the heck. Maybe if I were younger I would have liked it more... I don't know. But it's very depressing and god knows that's what I don't need today.
4,For Better For Worse Forever,I really like this book but I certainly thought it was one of her weaker books. This book is realistic fiction. It is about a girl name April Lancaster and her boyfriend died with cystic fibrosis. Then she went to St.Croix to get away from her troubles. Which there she met a dude name Brandon Benidict they have a good time together. Then April found out her brain tumor is back and she sneeks back to New York so Brandon wouldn't find out. To find if April survives you have to read this book.
5,Excelent book!,"The book For Better, for Worse, Forever is such a good book! I recommend this book to every teenager and even to my teachers! I especially would like for my best friend Rachel to read this book, I know she would love it! The setting of this story is both New York and St. Croix in the Carribean duuring the summer time. The main conflict of this book is weather or not Aprils tumor will become active again and when and where she will die. The protagonist is April and the antagonist would be the brain tumor April has. I really sudgest that you go out and read this book!"
3,Romance between two deeply hurt teens,"In this novel Lurlene McDaniel presents the affecting friendship between April and Brandon. Both of them have been hurt very deeply. Both in different ways. Together, however, they seem to win something essential back. The fun...Lurlene McDaniel is able to affect the reader emotionally by this book. However, I do not feel comfortable with the fact that both of the characters show self-pity. Both of them can be considered as being outsiders. They do not try to make more friends. I would describe April as being self-centred.Summing up I have to say that this book might be helpful for some people who suffer from severe illnesses. However, I feel that Lurlene McDaniel did not stress the fact enough that life is important. We cannot do, however, anything about our deaths. I cannot judge whether it is the right cure to read a book about fatal diseases when you are in such a situation yourself..."
3,Poor Customer Service,"I bought the jointer through Amazon/Tool Crib. Amazon was great - no problems at all. I had initial concerns about how I would get this heavy machine off the truck once it arrived. Consolidated freightways was excellent and couldn't have been more helpful. During the assembly process, I noticed that the jointer tilt gauge had been sheared in half. This is a cheap aluminum part on the fence. The fence was packaged under the heavy jointer and probably sustained the damage there (in crate). I called Delta for a replacement and didn't find them to be particularly concerned. They told me they would send me the part in a week. I called back after ten days and have now been told that it will be another week (I got the impression that this is a standard line). You would think that when you invest [so much] in a product that they would be a little more responsive and concerned than that. This has certainly given me cause to think about future Delta purchases."
2,Watch Out!,"The stand that accompanies this tool is not necessarily made in America - don't let them tell you otherwise. The base and motor are also manufactured in China. I called Delta and Amazon specifically to ask if the stand and motor were manufactured in the US and they said yes. I asked who made the motor for the 37-350 and they told me one of two american companies. Wrong. I now have paint chipping off of a stand purportedly made in the USA which has ""Manufactured in China"" printed plainly and clearly on the plates. I give Delta customer service a 1, the base a 2, the motor a 1, and the jointer a 5, resulting in a very favorable score of 2 stars. I buy products made in America, well, I did. WATCH OUT!!!"
1,Mostly lightweight fluff,For anyone new to this subject matter this book is a basic starting point. However the more you learn about the topic from other sources the more you realize this book is just lightweight fluff. This was simply opportunistic publishing of a coffee table book while the topic was hot. The author has little expertise in the subject matter (is she a contract writer? - her previous book was about tiles) and the book reads like breathless brochureware. If you want to research the topic for free check out the great web site fabprefab.com which predates this book and is frequently updated. Also there are other great books on prefab such as Colin Davies The Prefabricated Home.
2,"modern, yes; but very few homes available as prefabs","I was disappointed with this book. It includes profiles of 15 architectural firms. Seven of those profiles were of firms that have done one-off architect-designed homes made largely of pre-existing materials (usually shipping containers). That is not my definition of a prefab house. To me, a prefab house is one that I can order to be built on my lot. Of the eight firms that offer prefab houses, for three of them only computer-generated images were presented (not photos of real houses). That leaves only five firms offering prefab houses ready for market. Of those, one builds 10 houses per year in Finland. Another is in Australia. Two offer only really small homes (generally intended as second homes).The book does include (small) design plans and many photos for most of the houses. However, the fact that very few of those homes are available for me to purchase makes the book almost useless.[...]"
4,Fabulous!,"This is an excellent addition to my stereo system. Despite being a large unit, this 300 CD changer has saved me SO much space--I have said goodbye to jewel boxes forever. I love the grouping and 'hit list' features that allow you to arrange your discs in easily accessible and discernable categories. My one complaint--don't be fooled by the ""CD Text"" feature which claims to automatically enter data from 'equipped' discs. In fact, only about 5 of my 275+ CDs are so equipped. Be prepared to type those titles in yourself. But that's a small complaint. As the other reviewer said, this unit does NOT come with the remote with LCD display. It is the Sony CDP-CX-350 that does, for $ more."
3,"Tremendous functionality, but slow and fragile","On the plus side: The sound quality is excellent. The grouping, text display, search, and other functions are great. It's really cool having 300 CDs at your fingertips.On the minus side: Random shuffle play is a little frustrating, because it takes a good 10-15 seconds to unload a disc, choose another, load the new disc, choose a track, and start playing. After a while these long gaps get on your nerves.The big minus is this machine's fragility. I received mine as a Christmas gift. It worked great for about 12 months, then one day jammed up while loading a CD from the carousel into the drive slot. From that point it wouldn't work at all, the door wouldn't open, and the carousel tray wouldn't spin. My 300 CDs were held hostage inside! I had to take the cover off and manually remove all of my CDs. I then took the player to a repair shop. Two months and over $150.00 later it's working like new again.This machine is basically a dinosaur anyway. (...)"

1,Other people have done this better earlier.,"Take some Richard D James,Squerepusher and some of those classic elements that allmost all electronic music of today has got.Blend it together and this is what you get."
1,What am I missing here?,"I'm baffled that this collection won such a prestigious award. It's saturated with overly clever lines and bad jokes (""Oxymorons are dumb girls with clear skin""). It gets tiring really quick, as well as all the alliterations and puns. If this is poetry, Mary Karr once wrote, let us write prose."
2,This Rocket is a Dud,"A friend recommended this book to me. She kind of reminds me of Denise Duhamel. There are some funny moments, but overall I was disappointed."
5,A mystery with a twist,"This story has everything: tall dark and handsome hero, mysterious castle, damsels in distress and a forgotten past. This is a clean book with lots of surprises and a great ending!"
5,A copy should be on every speaker's reference shelf!,"A professional speaker for 26 years, I now refer to Speak with Confidence before each presentation for a quick brush up--learn, don't read or memorize material; shorten material by cutting the skeleton, not the flesh; handling Q & A using the SEER format, and more! A copy should be on every speaker's reference shelf!"
5,"Solid, readable, comprehensive","I chose this book for my class on homiletics for a church group. Me: a college English professor with 25+ years of teaching. Class: a variety of people, most not employed in fields where public speaking is part of the job description.Booher's material is organized logically by chapter, further broken down into numbered ""tips,"" and offers expert advice written in an engaging voice. It neither talks down to readers, nor buries them in the claptrap that contemporary textbook publishers think is ""value added,"" but which actually bores the pants off students and teachers.The author has that most valuable and rare commodity: horse sense."
5,Nice looking and durable,"Really like the durability of this dish set. I used to have big heavy ceramic dish set where most people needed to hold the platter with 2 hands do to the weight but not any more. This product is also kid friendly my 3 year old son has dropped it a few times onto my wood floors, no chips crack or damage of any kinds."
3,Too expensive,"To be honest, it is still on my ipad after a whole year. So very durable. However, its corners are very sharp and they look crooked. I would say not worth the price."
2,Hey Ms Postwoman,"The Post woman is a pretty rudimentary short film, which unfolds like a student or experimental flick. I was disappointed in the quality of this movie. The story wasn't really developed and the actors were just OK. I suppose it was a decent effort from beginner filmmakers, but if you are looking for a well developed more professional looking movie forget this one."
3,"simple, light, but kind of disappointing","i am using this swivel pad under my macbook pro. my reason for buying was to facilitate client meetings. i am a designer and need to turn my laptop frequently for the client to see what changes i have made to a design. so i am glad that it is lightweight & slim--easy to fit into my laptop bag. however, i was expecting less friction. perhaps my notion of lazy susans with ball bearings that offer amazing smoothness clouded my expectations. this is not a ball bearing system, it's teflon that rubs together. so there is definitely drag. i've had better turning results using the cloth coasters on my kitchen table.also, since it IS slim, a drawback i see is that it doesn't offer much space between the laptop and table (just over 1/8"") for cooling purposes. i will use this turn table for client meetings, but i will still use my stationary laptop stand for longer use."
2,Not what I expected,The laptop doesn't sit securely on the SwivlPad. We are using the laptop between two desks at work and need to turn it between the users and the laptop doesn't always stay on the SwivlPad. We are going to have to modify the unit with velcro to keep it in place. I wouldn't recommend this product. Disappointing to say the least.
2,Works OK but not a homerun,"Received product quickly and in perfect condition. It's very thin as advertised and I'm using it for a kitchen-bar laptop that I need to spin 180 degrees depending on where I'm sitting. It's a bit more flimsy than I thought it might be, but does the job if I'm careful spinning the machine (Dell XPS M1530). If I'm not careful, the machine gets knocked off the pad. This happens frequently, although I'm getting better at being more consistently careful to avoid that. The rubber along the edges has separated a bit due to this, but it's easy to 're-stick' it back down on it's underlying hard-plastic substructure. I would buy another one for $10, but not $20."

I think it is a good book to practice cuz it has a lot of exercises to practice(Sturcture and Reading)., but when I practice with listening comprehension section, I found out that it is more and more diffecult than the real test. I know the practice exercise should be difficult than, so it will be easy on the real test. In my view, The audio used with this book make me upset because it is 50-50North American and British accent and it is difficult to catch the words authough I tried to listen many times.In reality, the voice from the real test will clear. All in all, I think it is useless to practice listening with the unclear sound in this book. it also will make the practicer more confused. So, Let try the Longman set by Doborah Phillips. It is a very good set and make my score raise up to 100 point."
4,Healthy and tastes good too,South Beach Diet foods by Kraft are all in line with the SBD guidelines. This one is particularly tasty and filling.
5,Use it every day!,"This is the best white noise cd I own. Whenever my three month old son is fussy and can't seem to calm down or is crying, I put it on track 4, (vacuum cleaner) put him on my lap in the rocking chair, pull him close to me, get a pacifier ready, and he instantly calms down. Sometimes when he's extra cranky I'll hum to the same pitch of the vacuum for an extra calming effect. Sounds weird but it works.I've come to rely on it so much, I worry it will get lost so I'm ripping the tracks right now! During the night, I'll loop it on one track to keep him asleep, we both like track 1, the maternal heartbeat and track 6, the washing machine. There are other cds out there that would probably work, but I've found that this one is the best because of the continuous, barely changing sound that goes on for 9 minutes straight! Buy this cd, it's the best out there!"
5,Life Saver!,Our son had some colic issues when he was young. From 6pm until about 4am he would be upset and crying. Everytime we got him to sleep he would be back up again in 15min. We started using a hair dryer and that seemed to work but was a fire hazard at the same time. We then got this CD - what a life saver! His favorite was the vacuum. We set up the CD to repeat on this track and he would settle right down to sleep. The sounds would really calm him down. We now buy this CD for all of our friends. We would never survived those initial months of colic without this CD.
4,So thankful for this CD!,"Our 3 month old daughter has been battling colic for the past 2 months. When friends told me to try a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner, I thought they were insane! One night, we were at our wit's end and tried the hair dryer. She IMMEDIATELY stopped crying. This was great--however, I did not like having a hair dryer running non-stop for fear that it would ruin the dryer or possibly cause a fire! This CD has been a solution to our problem. I put the hair dryer track on repeat, and as annoying as it can be to an adult, it seems to truly soothe our baby. The vacuum track helped as well (the others didn't work as well for our baby). This CD is a must for PARENTS suffering through colic with their baby."
3,Great buy at $30.00,"$30 bucks is a fair price for this mat...if it was at retail, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. It's a bit chincey and ""cheap"" feeling, but it works great. I also love the way it folds up."
1,Troybilt lawn tractor cutting deck belt,"I would not recommend buying this belt. I have only used it to cut grass twice, on my 3rd time this weekend all of a sudden the cutting deck started to shake. I shut down the tractor and inspected the belt. About an inch section of the inside ""U"" shaped rubber was just missing. The outside wide part with the numbers on it was still intacked. I checked the blades and they spin fine. The drive belt on the main engine shaft above is still working. I thought I was getting a good price for a replacement belt but now I have to buy another. Should have known better. Going to get my exercise now cutting my 1 acre yard with push mower."
4,Longing for a Steinway,"The music and performance on this recording are excellent, however this session was done on a Baldwin grand piano with a very differnt sound from the Steinway used on Vol 1 of this series. Everyone with a keen ear for piano tones should have this recording to even more fully appreciate a well recorded Steinway."
4,Easy to follow quick reference-great way to get started!,"Windows XP Quicksteps is really good for the beginning Windows user. It uses simple terms, good color illustrations, and easy to follow shortcuts to help you get started. And it is complete enough to get you to a thorough understanding of Windows XP, even for an intermediate user."
5,nice,"fast delivery, buy some,very good plug at a fair price,I notice a bump in power and a extra mpg sure help out at the pump."
4,"Non-Glare ""Clear"" does NOT mean it is clear (transparent)","This is a very nice product; however, I was looking for this size in a completely clear finish, as I like the look of my desk underneath it. This is more of a matte, opaque finish, even though it says ""clear."" It's misleading. Like they say, it doesn't glare, but it's certainly not see-through."
5,HORRIFYING TALE!!,"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Does the punishment really fit the crime? Depends on who's side you're on. A MUST read for every horror fan out there."
2,"The waterfalls rate 5 stars, production values are amateur","I am a long time visitor to Kauai and consider my visits explorations rather than vacation trips. I expected a lot more from this release. The video and audio editing between the waterfall scenes is not very smooth and I wanted to hear the natural sounds of each falls. Some have cheesy music only. Too bad the production crew did not record and use the sound of each of their subjects. Do not expect a PBS documentary here, just some stunning natural beauty of one of the world's most scenic islands."
3,"Comme ci, comme ca","I've had the Sony 300 CD/DVD changer for several years now, and I have only one bone to pick with it, and that's that it doesn't recognize all CD/DVDs. I'm not sure if that's because older CD/DVDs can't be scanned, or if it's a glitch in the changer. All I know is that I still have to rely on my memory and the way I've organized my collection to be able to find about 40 percent of the CD/DVDs on this changer.plotdot"
5,LOVE This!,"I Loved this so much I bought in more flavors to enjoy...nice quality! Feels really good on too, and form fitting!"
5,Works great on my laminate desktop!,"After reading so many negative reviews, I did not want to get this Artistic's product from Amazon. I went to a large office supply store looking for a different brand and Artistic is the only one they carried. Since it is an easier return back to the store, I bought it there. It is a bit thinner than my last smaller clear desk pad, but it is great! The packaging is flat and when the pad is laid out on the desk it is perfectly flat and smooth. It provides a larger writing surface and is practically invisible. I could not be more pleased! I have a custom desk with an inset top of laminate, as it is more durable than wood. It works great on my laminate top."
2,Fair Quality Clear Desk Pad,"Actual dimensions of 19.75in x 34.75in are not even close to advertised 20 x 36. This replaced a desk pad I've had for over 15 years, which had turned yellow and bubbly. The new pad is about half as thick as my original pad. It also has marks all along each of the long edges of the pad - not exactly ""perfectly clear"". I'd return it, but I don't want to hassle with it. It'll be functional and serve its purpose. If you need better than ""fair"" quality, look elsewhere."
2,Not true to size,"The package claims that the size is 20 x 36, but this is very far from the reality. You get about 18 3/4 x 34 1/2. Another thing is that it's very slippery. It slides off the desk, and everything you put on it, also slides very easily. Not good - not recommending to anyone. Try Desktex - I got one and am very happy with it. Unfortunatelly, I already cut Artistic to size before I got Desktex, otherwise I would have returned it and order Desktex."
4,Just the table protector I was looking for,"We have a textured tabletop that my daughters find frustrating when doing homework or art projects. This smoothed out all the dents and irregularities in our table. I only wish I could get the same thing in a size large enough to cover the whole table. I haven't found a place to get this yet, but I'm sure it's out there. This topper is even better than getting a glass table top because its just a tiny bit more pliable. It will stick to the tabletop surface without sliding. It also has a little bit of give to it so that your hands and elbows don't get tired from working on this surface for long periods of time. You also break fewer pencil points."
4,Works great! (Just don't take too much of it.),"I've been taking this stuff for quite sometime now and I am really happy with it's (and my) performance. I made the mistake of taking too much of it over the course of a week or so, and I found that it had the OPPOSITE effect. So now, I take it 2 days on, and 2 days off. that seems to work the best for me."
2,it didn't work for me,"I would not recommend this product, because it did not work for me.my search will continue for an effective Tongkat product"
1,It will take forever to arrive!!,"I placed the order on July 6,.... They shipped it July 10,.. and it arrived July 21... It took 15 days instead of 3 - 5 business days. I tried to contact them several times... And there was no response till the day it arrived!!So I would suggest you to shop at the nearest vitamin shop"
1,passion sux,this specific brand of tonkgat ali doesn't work. I have used other brands of tonkgat ali with good results but this doesn't seem to work at all. poor quality
1,not enough infomation,"You didn't say the strength of the extract. Also, in Malaysia, Tongkat Ali has been declared as a protected plant since 2001 and any wild harvesting from its forest is considered illegal. And another thing, there are no Tongkat Ali plantations in Malaysia."
4,Good survey of the OT messianic prophecies,"This book is a quick survey of the major messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. Actually, I found the first chapter on how to interpret messianic prophecy the most helpful chapter in the book. Kaiser rejects the double fulfillment approach that many have taken with the prophecies of Christ's first coming. He makes a case for the Christocentric interpretation being the the primary interpretation in each case study. I do not always agree with this approach, as his interpretation of Isaiah 7:14 is less than satisfying.But in most instances, his interpretations are very good, and you can perceive Kaiser's strong evangelical faith in the volume. Recommended."
5,Superb and Convincing!,"This is an excellent and very informative book filled with pertinent facts for the discerning Jew, Christian or anyone else interested in learning the evidence as it points to the true Messiah. The review below notwithstanding. God's chosen people--gimme a break. This is the year 2002 and I wouldn't be surprised if the Messiah lands in Israel and smites her for her arrogance. Embrace the blessed truth and humble yourselves before it's too late. Shalom!"
3,Cute and superficial. A minor disappointment,"While cosse delves deeply into THE problem of theology she skims the surface in a pleasant, albeit unfulfilling look at how the proof would effect believers and non-believers alike. The highlight is the reaction of those who have read the proof. While some of her insights are satirical without being trivial, those expecting an exploration of powerful theological ideas will surely be disappointed."
2,"Not profound, not a thriller, probably not worth your time.","No matter what the publishers' reviews says, this book is not profound, it is not a thriller, and it is probably not worth your time.Laurence Cosse has written a little book that makes fun of the Frensh establishment. That's all. It happens to mention ""God"" and therefore publishers feel obliged to say that it is ""profound"". It isn't. It is simply a litterary mechanism for getting to the French ecclesiatical establishment.And it is not a ""thriller"". There is hardly even any story there. It moves from one little (usually 1, 1 1/2, or 2 pages) sketch to another, with only the weakest of excuses to bind them together. The individual scenes can be quite funny - especially if you have some previous knowledge and expereince of French culture and governance - but a collection of individual scenes does not make a story.Find something more rewarding to read."
2,A Let Down,"The premise of the book seemed to start well, but fizzle later. A similiar theme on the issue of God's existence was far better accomplished in the novel LUMINOUS by Peter Quest. At least his novel had a sensational climax."
2,"Ultimately, a disappointment","The flyleaf of this book grabbed me and wouldn't let go: this story revolves around a document that irrefutably, absolsutely proves the existence of (a male, Christian) God. How could I resist? How could any of us?The novel begins with a bang but ends with a whimper. What I found most interesting was how the author sketched the characters' reactions to this proof after they've read the document. The president of France, for example, dissolves into a state of gentle radiance (that others judge as insanity) and leaves his post to tend to his beloved wife and roses. Most of the characters are male and represent Church and State...and, sure enough, they end up suppressing the evidence. Ultimately, then, there are no surprises in this book, and I was very disappointed that a female author chose to script *all* characters, save one man's sister (a minor voice), as male. ""Churchianity"" prevails yet again."
3,Works great on sewing machines!!,"I know it says that this is for Desktop Electronics, which means computers, more or less. However, my ""desktop"" is my sewing table where I love to make quilts. After many hours of piecing quilts, my sewing machine collects a lot of thread dust, or LINT, which is difficult to clean just by using ""fuzzy sticks"" or pipe cleaners. So with the additional help of this handy dandy Vacuum, cleaning my sewing machine is a breeze and I am a HAPPY QUILTER!!!"
5,very pleased,Works well. I chose this one because it runs on electricity and I wouldn't need to be near my computer to vacuum my sewing machine equipment. It has good power and does the job!
1,It deserves rather 0,"Worst accessory ever! DON'T BUY IT. It doesn't have power to blow or vacuum a smallest piece of styrofoam or paper. It'just doesn't work, it looks nice, but is utterly loud and gets clogged in a second, I mean if you somehow manage to scratch some dust of your equipment."
1,100% useless. No Suction At All!!!,"I bought this from another retailed. I will be returning it immediately. I did not have unrealistic expectations. However, this is completely useless. My keyboard was worse after using this. It did not pick up anything! Not the tiniest speck of dust.Worthless.There's more suction created by closing a door 10 feet away than from this vacuum. Is that an exaggeration? No, because this ""vacuum"" creates ZERO SUCTION.None.None at all.I checked it all out. Clean, new filter: check. plugged in, turn on and making noise: check. Air brush (turbine) in proper place and spinning when powered on: check. Suction: NO.Worthless. It struggled and I struggled to get it to lift an eyelash from a flat, smooth surface."
1,Poor Performance,I just bought this Vacuum. It's just good for nothing. You barely get to feel the pressure. It was just waste of money.
2,Weak suction and POOR filter,"Like other reviewers, when I first saw that this vac was electric, I thought the suction would be really strong. It is not and I promise you there are battery powered vacuums out there that are much more powerful than this. It will suck up only the loosest dust and debris from surfaces so the brush on the end of the nozzle has to do most of the work. Worse the filter is a tiny cloth thing that will let many small particles pass through. I used the vac to suck up some debris from a piece of plastic I was sawing and many of the particles (much larger than your average piece of dust mind you) went right through the filter and into the motor housing. That's another problem too - the exhaust goes THROUGH the motor and out the back end - not the best design when you have a poor filter."
2,Too Cumbersome,Poor suction and difficult to get into narrow places even with the extensions. Cord needs to be longer. This may be OK to clean your desk top's exterior vents but inside the case.....? Forget about it.
3,Not very powerful,Not very powerful I will still need canned air and probably wont us this. Because the caned air is much more powerful.
2,Diana,I wouldn't recomend this book to any middle schooler. The sentances were so compliacted that I barely understood what I was reading. The book seemed to last forever which made it very boring.It's definatly a book for an older audience. Stay //\\//sync!
2,Review from a Junior high student,"I am a student from the Egg Harbor Township Middle School in New Jersey. I thought this book was complicated, but it was not entirely as boring as I thought it would be. This book had difficult words to understand, but it was interesting in some parts. Even so, I would not recommend this book for a middle school student.Sincerely,A Concerned Student"
2,Not the picture,"What i got was not what was shown in the picture, i got one cheap plastic case that holds all 6 dvds on the same cheap ring"
1,Makes me embarrassed to be a man.,"This show is only for the mentally, socially, and maturity bankrupt. All the worst characteristics and stereotypes about men, glorified and amplified to point of near parody. The joke is, it's completely serious. A sad, sad excuse for entertainment, and on behalf of men everywhere, I'm sorry it exists."
3,"Coffee Carafe, good for a Meal","This carafe is great if your having a large dinner party and you want to place coffee carafes out in the spaces. If you looking to keep coffee all day, this is not the carafe for you."
1,Waste of money.,No two readings are remotely identical - they're all over the map. I'm surprised Omron put their name on this piece of junk.
5,Great Book,"This is a great bathroom book! I have learned so much from my trips to the bathroom now. Everyone that comes over and has to use my bathroom now has to know where to find this book because they have to have it. It's great for all that ""everything you ever needed to know but never thought about"" kind of stuff."
5,Awesome and addictive!,"I love, love, love this book! I am always pulling it out and shocking people with the facts in it. The facts in it are great and truly interesting. I wish they would come out with a second version of it. I've pulled this book off the shelf more than just about any book I've owned!"
5,DenverArtist's Wonderful Book Review's,I love this Bathroom Reader Edition by Uncle John. I have read now all but 4 Bathroom Reader Books and this is the most interesting. It is pack with Useful Facts! I recommend to anyone...
3,A compendium of useless trivia.,"This is the perfect reader for the bathroom. It will be a bunch of trivia that will not serve any purpose or accomplish any goals. But then, who needs stimulating reading when you are on the pot."
5,Normal Transaction,"Transaction normal, book in great condition, slow shipment but likely due to the holidays. Thank you."
3,this book have interesting facts to read for kids,"my kid loves it, I think is ok to read, but a kid can read a lot without getting bored."
1,Not up to Sony's standards,"I have owned many Sony products over the years. This is the first one I have owned that not only does not work properly but which with Sony customer service has been most unhelpful. I ordered one in November 2001 and when it arrived it had paint chipped off the case and did not play properly. It was replaced with a new unit in December (I had to wait for the credit to be applied to my card and then re-order. Sony would not ship me a new model once they had received my damaged one). It lasted less than a month before it developed a dragging sound when playing tapes. It was sent for service, had a motor, clutch and belt replaced. The evening it was returned to me it kept switching back and forth between play and auto rev and then ate a tape.While the small size and the rechargable battery would be a definite plus if the machine functioned, at this price I consider the WMFX671 not only to be a bad buy, but the worse Sony product I have ever owned."
2,This mission really is impossible,"Wow, when I bought this game I thought it would be cool to be a secret agent in a video game. Boy was I wrong on this one. First of all, this game really is impossible. I luckily got to the second mission but I didn't get any further than that. And now this game is collecting dust on the shelf. This one is only for truly diehard fans of the series. And good luck!"
3,Patience is a Virtue,"If your looking for a Goldeneye clone, than this game is not for you. The graphics and sound effects are sub par, but the gameplay and missions are quite clever. I was slightly let down when I first started playing, but with a bit of patience and a few levels in, it started to grab me. I think the biggest mistake of the game is trying too hard to follow the plot of the movie rather than creating interesting levels.There are two game selections; Possible and Impossible aka Easy and Hard. I found the Possible to be too easy and completed the game in about a day.With no multiplayer functions, MI quickly loses it's interest and lifespan.The little dialouge quips of Mr Hunt are quite funny, and he even provides some comic relief throughout the game.I recommend you try before you buy...P.S. The finish off the game/credit sequence is quite clever allowing Mr Hunt too intereact with the creators of the game."
4,Fun but Hard,"well if you dont like difficult stadegy games, DONT buy this. but if you like challenges, then try it out."
1,Worst N64 Game Ever,"... In more ways then one, it trys to match the style and fun of Goldeneye, but fails miserably. Considering this game was made after Goldeneye, you would think it would at least have quality graphics, but no. Gameplay and control is horrible and frustrating, where it offers only one controller set up and one camera angle where you are stuck behind the character. The missions are vrey booring too. This game is very hard even on the ""possible"" setting and has glitches where you loose the missions at the end after doing everything your supposed to.Do yourself a favor and never play this horrible game."
1,BAD!,"This game stinks! I hate it! The olny level I liked was a snow one that had two parts to it, I couldent unlock any levels so I olny had 2. The stupit level I also had was this masion thing that was impossible! I hated to stick those things in the vents and of the vents I ALWAYS got caught. Yes, this game does have good video but thats it.DONT GET!"
4,still playing it,"I am still playing this game after 6 months. I've gotten through the possible level and to the train on the impossible level. I don't think you have to be a diehard MI fan to play this. I find the most difficult section is trying to get to the computer hanging on the wire, mainly because of trying to dodge the lasers without losing too much life. As for the graphics, the only strange part is that some of the baddies come partway through a closed door, but that just clues you in to them being there and you can get ready to blast them to oatmeal. GOOD GAME!"
1,Impossible To Sell,"The Bad Graphics, colors, gadgetry, and the game seeming like endless repeat, I warn you, friend, beware!"
3,"This is Griffin's ""Aviators""","I have read a lot of WEB Griffin's other books so I picked this one up. Griffin's real name is Butterworth.This is Griffin's ""The Aviators"" with a touch of Craig mixed in, and where the hero doesn't sleep with the rich girl in the scenes, just falls in love.Hero can do lots of stuff, from drive trucks to be an ad exec a year out of college to run small boats. Dad is an ex-SgtMaj and big trucking company owner, granddad is a former Russian (pre-commie) SgtMaj.Hero gets called up in the draft. The book follows him army basic to warrant student pilot-- to a commission because he is so freaking cool and wonderful.He also gets the rich girl.All that was missing was to have the rich girl be related to the CG."
4,Fast Shipping/Defective Pad,"Shipping was fast, but the desk pad was defective: permanent blurs, dents & marks in the clear plastic (not due to shipping). As I desperately needed a pad, I didnt return it.FYI: This is a totally clear plastic pad with a glossy (NOT matte) surface."
2,Not true to size,"The package claims that the size is 19 x 24, but this is very far from the reality. You get about 17 3/4 x 22 1/2. Another thing is that it's very slippery. It slides off the desk, and everything you put on it, also slides very easily. Not good - not recommending to anyone. Try Desktex - I got one and am very happy with it. Unfortunatelly, I already cut Artistic to size before I got Desktex, otherwise I would have returned it and order Desktex."
5,Perfectly Clear,"Clear and durable desk pad. I am using it under my dog's food dishes, and it is performing well in protecting the wood floor. I have washed in with dish detergent repeated, and it continues to look great."
3,This book has some hideous errors..But also great examples.,"This book is only of value to an advanced VB user.I have gotten some good ideas from some of the example code. However it is troublesome in that one does not know when the book can be trusted.Chapter 17 . Optimizing VB Applications has a section Simplify The Math (page 942)which has very poor examples as to how to optimize code. One example which employs the random number generator Rnd() is hideously in error in that it is not only a less than optimum way to avoid the use of the power ^ , but it uses Rnd() two times which uses two different random numbers when the task was to square a function which used one random number.The book provides good examples for advanced users, but is of little value to people who are trying to learn Visual Basic.Leo J. Landkamer programmer at large"
1,What a waste!,"This is POORLY written book. Many sample programs do not work or even compile. Many of the variables still use the name ""RDO"" instead of ADO. Obviously, the author(s) never tested their sample programs, because they do not run. So be careful what book you buy. You could waste $...."
1,"a lot of that should have been in, is missing","The book is full with examples, but a lot of them needs some files from the CD, and very much of them are missing from the CD, poor sybex support for such problems !!!"
1,Poor sybex support for this full of errors/missing files,"basically good book, but with a lot of references to missing from the CD files, and no support from sybex. there are better books and more supported(e.g. wrox)"
2,Nice to look at on the shelf,"Not comfortable, your toes get pushed to the front and dug into by the criss cross straps. They look kind of cheap once they're actually on your feet, I was pretty dissapointed but I got them at a really good price so I'll make the best of it."
1,"Crowded pages, useless","Disappointed, quite confusing and not helpful for my kid. Would not recommend it. The pages are very crowded, my child did not get interested at all, it was a waist of money."
2,Frustrating...,"If you're going to read Amis, read ""Time's Arrow"" which I found far more compelling than London Fields. The characters in ""London Fields"" are so self-absorbed and pathetic that I had a difficult time appreciating the cleverness of this book. Yes, it is well-written for the most part, and there are moments of comic relief (hurrah for Marmaduke!), but for the most part, what a downer. I like a lot of dark books, but this one just didn't cut it."
3,...at the speed of Clive,"Beautiful writing, not at all enjoyable. Not for me, at least. I find it difficult to enjoy a book where I don't care at all for the characters. Vividly portrayed characters. The only person I cared at all for in the book was under a year old, and she does not get much time on the page. A book without a character to like is a song without a melody. Some people may enjoy this, but I found it difficult to read.But what makes London Fields different from, say, 'Lolita' which I enjoyed a great deal. They share a lot - beautiful writing, despicable characters. The difference is Nabokov somehow possible to empathize with Humbert Humbert. Obviously this was not the author's goal - but perhaps it should have been.I'm giving this three stars because it is technically amazing and my objection really boiled down to a matter of personal opinion."
2,Martin Amis,"Amazon was fine. It's just that Amis was heralded (and in particular this book by him) and now, 60% through the book, I'm struggling to maintain interest. (Of course Lucky Jim, by his father, was another thing---you needed good bladder control to read that one.)"
1,to long and simply boring.,"I have limited time to read and I simply couldn't dedicate any more time to this book. The plot is simply dull. Mr Amis tries to hard to be ........ ( place your prefered adjective), and it is simply not. After great effort and with some degree of regret, I leave a book unfinished ( the second time in my life)."
4,Splendid Literature,"This is my first Martin Amis novel and while it took adjustment on my part, I soon fell in line. I liked it a lot, the style was refreshing - unlike the usual newspaper writer journalism that passes for best selling novels these days. I'm now on to reading Mrs Nabokov. BTW, how does one pronounce the author's name ? Is it Ah-mee or A-miss ?"
2,Contrivance,Martin Amis is following a tendency by some writers to write a story where complexity seems to be more important than the story itself. He is weaving in and out of several stories within the story to a point where it all becomes contrived and boring. The quest for complexity is also reflected in the vocabulary where Mr. Amis seems to have made a point of reaping the benefits from his investment in a thesaurus. What could have been a well-written story with fine portraits of characters from the more sordid sides of London life is lost in the intricacies of words for words sake.
3,should've been half as long,"the first two-hundred pages of this book completely impressed me: there was a dark, electric writing style, a bizarre and continually intriguing interplay between the narrator and his characters, and the sense that the world being put forth by Amis was rich and layered.but the book runs out of steam. scenes begin to continually repeat themselves (how many time can Keith and Guy visit Nicola's apartmane with absolutely NOthing happening???), and the world of the novel is not given the depth and detail necessary. too much time spent on characters who are ultimately cartoons. of course there is nothing wrong with writing cartoony characters, but the problem is that such characters cannot carry a novel, as they were commisioned by Amis to do.anyhow ultimately a worthwhile book to read for the originality of its structure and the sometimes captivating writing."
3,"Too Clever By Half, Kilgore","Two peculiar things happen wherever discussions of Martin Amis, or his works, pop up: allusions to Nabokov; none to Vonnegut. Explain, please."
2,"A glib, vulgar book from an alienated writer","Martin Amis, too talented for his own good, has created a London of over-the-top too uninteresting to be either repellent or satirical. Amis misses the mark (by a long way) of earlier novels such as the highly accomplised Money, probably because as we read we know he has written the words but he, as narrator, seems miles away. The result is, for all its mellifluous prose, a glib, vulgar treatise on class. A surprising misfire."
2,I gave up,"I have enjoyed some of Martin Amis' (un-coincidentally) shorter books, but found that the clever premise was not enough to carry this missive to its (non-mysterious) conclusion. The character of Nicola in particular struck me as completely cartoonish and incomprehensible. Amis draws the male characters with a bit more feeling, but takes so long to actually get to the point that I decided my time would be better spent elsewhere about half-way through this book. This isn't the first time Amis has tackled the 'I'm beautiful and seem to have everything, but I'm going to kill myself to spite the world' idea (see Night Train), and it makes even less sense here than in that book."
3,A very long and complex novel,This novel was the first and only novel that I have read by Martin Amis.I found the book complex from the the start for a number of reasons. The first is the style of the book with each chapter written in two halves. The second reason was that the title is a place in East London but the book is set in West London. The third reason was that he plays with your mind and gets you wondering when certain things that you can see would happen but not knowing when they would happen.It is a very long book and took me 3 months to read. It had me thinking a lot and on the whole I think it was a quite realistic reflection of modern life in London (and elsewhere!).If you are willing to read a book that will have you thinking all the time and you are determined to go through certain long passages of a book in bewilderment then I think this book would be for you.If you are wanting to read a book to relax then I think this book is not for you!
4,don't be afraid,"Don't be afraid to pick this up and read it! I've heard and read some harsh critiques, but in fact, I enjoyed the hell out of 'London Fields.' The last reviewer called it 'elitist' (after claiming to have read at a college level in the seventh grade-- now that's elitist!) (Smile) Yes, this book is at times obscure and repetitive, but overall, it's a great ride. Amis threw caution to the wind, which should be lauded, shouldn't it? Good lord, most authors would never take the kind of chances Amis takes here. Isn't that the essence of literature (reading and writing)?"
2,OK I get it--he's clever,The author is obviously very talented and he uses every page of this too long book to prove it to us. The book is extremely repetitive and goes no where. I really liked some of the characters such as Keith but by the end of the book I really didn't care who dunnit.
1,There's a reason why publishers employ editors...,"...and, unfortunately, it is quite clear that Mr. Amis never availed himself of the service. I remember coming to the end, feeling the narrative beginning to wind down to a conclusion, FINALLY.What a relief, I thought to myself. I made it through one of the longest books I've ever read.Then I looked, and I was only a third of the way through the book. I felt no emotion for Keith, nothing but derision for Guy, our ""murderee"" was nothing but a gorgeous whore, and as for the narrator? The only character for whom I felt any empathy was Kath, whose under-inclusion in the book seemed only to serve the purpose of giving the other characters something off of which to aimlessly bounce.The worst books are those about which, somewhere in the pages, I find myself asking, ""Why should I care?"" Not a page went by that I didn't ask that question. The only reason I gave it one star is because zero is not an option."
1,Awful,"A really horrendous read, I don't see how anyone could have enjoyed anything about this idiotic book. We've read about the modern millenial desert, and this work offers nothing new. I am not someone who is oblivious of allegory, symbolism, imagery, etc, but I felt as if the entire book was some sort of an inside joke meant for people familiar with London. Cryptic phrases, and really irritating, persistent attempts at humor on every page. I cared as much for the characters on page 1 as I did on page 300. And as mentioned by a previous reviewer, the authorial presence is extremely annoying and totalitarian, not allowing the reader to formulate any sort of outside opinion on the characters, who themselves are thoroughly uninteresting. You'll get as much out of buying this book as you would out of just burning 15 dollars."
1,My apologies,"I will apologize before I continue.That done, I downloaded this title to my kindle because I read a review of this author in Atlantic. He sounded like one of those very erudite wordsmiths that makes you think. That was the review. The book is confused, boring and pretentious. Sorry, I apologized already. I read a lot. A lot. I read History, novels, Science, Biography, Business, and assorted other. I average two books a week. I didn't finish this one. I couldn't.A previous review said this is an author that people love or hate. Allow me to add a third category: I just don't care. Not worth love or hate. I will, however, remember the author's name in order to avoid him.If Amis is your cup of tea I salute you. If you haven't tried him yet, check one out of the Library first so you can take it back and not have to pay a price for your disappointment."
4,Very interesting,"""London Fields"" is one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time. It's on the long side and the pacing is pretty slow, which can make it a tedious read at times, but trust me: it's totally worth it. The story only appears to be laid out for the reader right at the start of the novel, but there are some fantastic twists and turns, especially at the end. The characters are all pretty unlikeable, but Martin Amis is a fantastic writer with a very unique voice. If you're looking for a book that's very unorthodox and extremely well-written, check this one out."
4,Comically dark and darker...,"On reading other reviews of Martin Amis' book one thing continues to mystify me- how is it possible to spend months or even weks reading this novel! I simply could not put it down even though the characters spewed all over my lap at times. And what characters they are! Keith is the most hilarious creature and Nicola is the ultra-feminist gone completely mad. They both enjoy expectorating the clueless Guy. And the secondary characters don't miss a beat.Kudos to Mr. Amis!!! Yes it is a dark, satirical nightmare but I laughed every other page and I do not consider myself comically soft. If there is a better English writer alive right now I would pay any sum for their name."
4,The definition of despair,"Despair in and of itself, isn't post-modern. Martin Amis hasn't re-invented it, nor has he rediscovered it. What he has done is re-claim it, catapulting himself and modern fiction into a new reality. Harsh, aggressive and without remorse, ""London Fields"" embraces its ability to bite, relishing every last ounce of feeling it consumes."
4,"An often brilliant, but seldom ""warm"" read","Amis's wonderful, ricochet-style prose is given full opportunity to shine when matched with this rambling, sometimes-compulsive story of four doomed characters. As addictively despairing as Amis is, this book still took me a few months to finish, though I can't put my finger on why. My one gripe is the distant, almost quizzical eye with which the author regards his subjects...for all the work of this expert machine, there is very little heat generated...only the sections describing Kim Talent hit any kind of emotional nerve. Still, what an author, and what an achievement...a Talent that makes you gape in wonder."
5,Excellent!,Mr Amis' wry sense of humor and imagination capture the reader and keep them prisoner until the very end.
5,Which takes more talent? Darts or novels?,"A serious comment. Keith Talent (London Fields' most compelling character - now a modern icon) is an embodiment of Martin's talent - and his ""darting"" is an analogue to Martin A's writing. That's pretty obvious. I play darts - I once scored 180 in three darts in a pub match, the max. To play well, you need both pinpoint precision and total relaxation. You need to find a groove, not twitch, be true - or, as Keith put it, you need to throw ""sincere darts"". It can help to be drunk. The mind must be immersed - but thought is fatal. And that is what is so brilliant about this book (and ""Money"") - the instinctive quality of the writing. Any old Uni professor can THINK - and very boring it usually is. The important thing is talent. (And sex.) Read and enjoy - Ben Twiston-Davies."
4,"Slightly Flawed, Yet Brilliant","Martin Amis created some of the most memorable characters that I have ever read in this book, and was able to suprise this reader in completely plausible ways (given the eccentric characters, of course). It was also one of the funniest books I've read in the past few years.Amis' juxtaposition of the main story with apocalpse, however, was contrived, distracting, and I felt added little."
3,Mainstream Club Music..blah blah blah,"I was particularly happy when I found this album was available for a not unreasonable price. Many people know the Klubbheads as the group that broke through in 1998 with the club smash ""Kickin' Hard."" Not having heard much else from them, I decided to order the album hoping the rest of the tracks would be as fun as Kickin Hard. I have to say I was a little disappointed with this album. It was entirely too cheesey. A couple of tracks were decent (Klubhopping) but looking back on it now, I should've just settled for the Kickin Hard single or 12""."
5,"Brilliant, just brilliant!!","I haven't even finished the book yet, but it is obviously a bestseller 'in my book'. I have both Venus & Serena's more recent autobiographies, but this book is by far the best!!! If your looking for a straight to the point, why are they successful, how were they with siblings, and parented, this is the book for you! Very direct, yet entertaining, an enjoyable read for a parent. I highly recommend it & the price is great(a penny)!!!"
3,"cool cars, bad graphics and controls","this games is cool with the types of suv's u can choose, but the controls are rough, and graphics are very bad compare to other car games such as gran turismo. Test drive 2 was better"
4,A fun game.,"This is a fun game, and I like the tracks you get to play on. However, if you can, get the DREAMCAST version instead. The graphics are better there."
2,Not reccomended.,"I bought and installed this speedo on my 93 HD XLH. There were two issues that factored into the low score for this item. 1 factor for the item that was shipped, another for the item in general. Factor #1, the speedo that I was sent worked perfectly for a day. After the first day, the light that lit up the face of the speedo went out. Now I can not see my speed at night. I have no intentions on sending it back because it would require too much work to cut up the wires, send it back, wait for a replacement, then reinstall. The second factor has more weight on it. I was not aware that I would need to buy another piece so that both turn signals light up the dummy light for the turn signal. If you do not buy this second piece and install it than when you put on a turn signal, all turn signals will blink. To counter this, I hooked up the right turn signal only."
4,Demis Roussos Best of 30 Years,"The seller shipped the order on time, it arrived in great condition and it was sealed. However, I was unable to copy the last couple of songs from the CD's to my laptop. I did not contact the seller because it was unlikely anyone had another new copy of this CD set and I was pleased to have the set."
2,"Good History, Bad Theology!!!","""The Other Side of Calvinism"", is a detailed resource on the history of men like St. Augustine, John Calvin, and Jacob Arminius, but unfortunately it suffers from the fatal disease of man's self exaltation.Author's like this need to face the truth of the Word!!! I would rather have Dr. Vance just say that He doesn't care to agree with the Holy Scriptures rather than creating staw men arguments that are directed towards Calvinism.All of Dr. Vances unfounded arguments have been refuted by the Apostle Paul in the book of Romans. From a theological perspective I would not consider this book to be exegetical by any means."
3,searching for Biblical truth,"For those interested in a sound work that refutes Calvinist 5 points - see George Bryson's ""Five Points of Calvinism"". An excellent, well-balanced, Biblically supported and clearly argued piece."
1,An Arminian MORONATHON,"I do not mean to be cruel, but scholar ship thy name is not Vance! If this is the best response Arminians have to the Gospel of sovereign free grace, they are in serious trouble. I recommend ordering the four and a half hour DVD documentary - Amazing Grace: The History & Theology of Calvinism. It features R.C. Sproul, D. James Kennedy, George Grant and a host of others. It can be order through this site"
2,"MAN,S WAR AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD","THIS BOOK IS JUST ANOTHER PREDICTABLE DIATRIBE AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD. WHEN ARMINIANS CAN SPIN AWAY THE TRUTH THEY CONSTANTLY PRAY FOR GOD TO SAVE SINNERS THAT ARE NOT INTERESTED;WHEN THEY CAN SPIN AWAY THE TRUTH THAT GOD SOVEREIGNLY PASSED BY THE RACE OF FALLEN ANGELS AND CHOSE,SOVEREIGNLY,TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE RACE OF FALLEN MEN;AND THEY CAN SPIN AWAY THE TRUTH THAT ANTICHRIST HAS BEEN PREDESTINED TO DAMNATION BY GOD FROM ALL ETERNITY,THEN THEY MAY GET A HEARING FROM OTHER THAN THE HIGHLY IGNORENT AND PERVERSE. GOD CLEARLY STATES IN THE BIBLE THAT HE PREDESTINATES THE DESTINY OF THE REBELLIOUS SINFUL LITTLE POTS. HIS ANSWER TO THOSE THAT HATE THIS IS THAT HIS GRACE HIS FREE AND HE DOES NOT TAKE ORDERS FROM MEN. THE BIBLE STATES GOD IS EVERYTHING AND MEN ARE NOTHING. SO LET ALL THE SINFUL LITTLE POTS BE LIARS AND THE POTTER BE TRUE. J W MAJORS"
1,A waste of time,"As one who has been an arminian and who is now a calvinist, I read this book with much interest. Truth is THE important issue. Not labels. The very size of the book lead me to think that the author had possibly done his homework. What I found amazed me. The author continually misrepresented the true positions of calvinism and quoted many sources that were inferior. He never fully delt with the arguments brought out in Jonathan Edwards' ""Freedom of the Will"" and many times quoted an author for just a sentence or two and completely took the quote out of context. Also, he would quote a bible verse and not even discuss the calvinist's interpetation. He seems to have a problem with God being soverign even though he states that he believes in the soverignty of God. He also attributes some things to mere ""chance"". Even most arminian scholars disagree with that. Overall, this book does little for the thinking arminian to further his cause."
1,Babbling foolishness,"This person has to be a card carrying member of Hate America First, Inc. One of MoveOn.org's ardent blind disciples.I have read some of his other diatribes, and they provide excellent examples of all the logic errors I studied in college.He never has anything except hate to spout (maybe his daddy didn't love him, and he never offers practical solutions.His blast against war, government, and western civilisation show that he has lived his entire life in a pseudo-academic bubble.Luckily, he lives in the U.S. If he moved to another country, he would be shut up quickly."
1,Just check it out......,"I've read this book from both sides of the Calvinist/Arminian fence, and I just want to offer one piece of advice: check his citations. You'll find that Vance is unbelievably selective, and even disingenuous at times."
1,Full of sound and fury-signifying nothing!,"Of all the inept attacks on the Reformed Faith, this book takes first prize. Vance's hermeneutics and exegetical skills are so bad that I wonder if he really studied theology. I give him the open challenge to meet me in public debate on his book. But I doubt he will defend what he has written. He knows it is filled with logical and exegetical errors. Vance, if you read this, contact me at 1-800-41-TRUTH and we will set up a debate on your theology. Dr. Robert Morey"
4,EARLY CHRUCH FATHERS,"ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ THE WRITINGS OF THE EARLY CHURCH FATHERS. THOSE THAT WHERE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE APOSTLES AND DISCIPLES WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT DOCTINES OF THE EARLY CHURCH WERE REGARDING SALVATION. THE FURTHER AWAY IN TIME FROM THE EARLY CHURCH FATHERS,GREATHER THE ERROR. CALVINISM WAS NEVER TAUGHT AS A DOCTRINE NOR BELIEVED BY THE EARLY CHURCH!"
5,Excellent work exposing Calvinism for the heresy it is,"This is a Biblical effort to expose Calvinism. Personally, I am surprised by the few who say it isn't scholarly. It makes me wonder if they might be Calvinists themselves Vance allows the Bible to take Calvinism apart piece by piece. Dr. Vance has done the body of Christ a great service by giving us this excellent work."
4,Great book...maybe just a tad over my head though,"This was an excellent book to work through. As I stated in the review title this book was a just a bit over my head. But not enough over my head that I didn't enjoy it or get something from it. This is a book that I will definitely go to again in a year or so. I imagine I will pick up even more from it then.I think it is okay to study a little bit of material that is just out of your grasp. It gives me something to aspire to anyway. If you study too much chess material that is a little out of bounds or that is all you study then you might be asking for trouble. Anyway, great book, great games, well written and well constructed. Highly recommended! Gambit really does turn out high quality books. I am talking about the construction of the book itself. They are meant to be used and built to last!"
1,Don't waste your money!,Don't waste your money on this product that you can get for free by joining weight watchers under a trial membership. This is a major rip-off!
2,Disturbing Behavior CD Soundtrack,"Nice product, missing some of the tunes that are listed in the credits... but other than that it is an OK CD from an OK movieI needed it for one or two songs so it served its purpose"
3,would have been better with flagpole sitta,"This is an okay cd but why isn't Harvey Danger on it? I mean, this is like one of the main songs to the movie."
1,SHUT UP ABOUT HARVEY DANGER,THEY ARE A ONE HIT WONDER BAND AND NOBODY LISTENS TO THEM ANY MORE. (APLLIES TO THE ABOVE.)
4,One Fly CD.,This is a real good soundtrak and beats most others. Don't even knock it! The Flys track is da bomb!
1,This is crap,"What the hell is up with this, I thought Flagpole Sitta would be on here, why the hell isn't it??? It's not even worth buying!!! Don't buy this cd!!!!!!"
5,Metor Vacuum MDV-1BA DataVac Pro 4.5-AMp Computer Vac/Blower,I love it and easy to clean everything computer's area stuffs and HO Model Railroad Layout Table with Handle Vacuum!Joe Wood
2,Poorly Constructed,"Pros:It runs?Cons:It gets VERY hot very fast.The back easily falls off during use, spilling all that has been vacuumed.It has an overall cheap feel to it.I returned mine to Amazon."
4,Works good but could be better...,The product does what it says -- I've been using it a lot to blow away the dust from my computer. If the blower could be more powerful it would be a lot better. It is also very light which makes cleaning easier.
4,Very handy,I do a lot of electronics work on computers and audio equipment. This is much easier to use than compressed air. Lots of control with all the nozzles provided. The end that attaches by sliding over 2 screws could be more sturdy - it has never come apart but feels like it could.
4,Good!,I bought this for my boyfriend to use on his computer and he likes it. The only negative about this anti static vacuum is that it gets hot really quickly.
3,So-So,Not bad for the money but the unit gets very hot after a couple of minutes of use and is VERY loud. I'm in a construction office and use this on our large format printers and plotters.
5,Incredible!!,This product does exactly as it says. It is extremely powerful as a vacuum and as a blower. Definitely a good buy and will save money over the long run not having to buy that compressed air!!
3,"Loud, but reasonable suction.","Not bad. The best parts are the adapters that let you get into small corners. Otherwise, it is a typical small vaccuum."
4,a power house with all the right tools,"Although there is one drawback to this item being it gets hot very quickly, it does a cleaning job like no other. when I use it I just wait for it to cool off which does not take long at all and then continue cleaning. it will continue to clean every space on your computer. It does not matter if it is a ""crawl space"" type crevice, regular small space, vent air holes or any other space. This vaccum has all the right tools and all the right amount of power.Well worth the investment."
3,Poor Quality,"This vacuum says made in America, well, in this case that isn't a good thing. It has the feel of something you might find made in China and sold on QVC. The main hose is kind of short so you have to hold the actual vacuum to get into different things. The various attachments don't fit together well and keep coming off."
5,Electronics cleaning,"Finaly, a compact electronics cleaner (for my sewing room)!!! - and at a reasonable price. This thing really works well, has a seemingly powerful suction and perfect for getting underneath the bobbins and needle plates for cleaning."
5,Exactly what I expected,"I researched this product extensively, and I pretty much got exactly what I expected.It loud, but it's a high powered vacuum/blower. Get over it.It heats up. not as bad as I expected. It's a high amperage motor in a metal cannister. Get over it.The attachments work great. The lint bunnies that came out even after vacuuming were impressive.My only criticism is one that I saw in other reviews. The cover that secures the filter is quite primitive, and does fall off way to easily.If I was going to take this vacumm around, I would tape this end on so it doesn't fall off in someone's office."
4,Power in a small package,I was surprised how simple the vacuum looked when I took it out of the box. I couldn't imagine it would have so much power. When I turned it on I could feel the torque from the motor twist the vacuum in my hands. It really does an excellent job on electronic parts and has MANY attachments! It works well in both suction and blower modes and is simply a matter of putting the attachments on the end you prefer.The only cons I could list are it is loud and the body gets warm VERY quickly (this fact is noted in the instructions). I would recommend keeping the duty cycles short and give the motor a cooling off period. It's very efficient so I don't think you would have it on for very long anyway. I'm not sure I attached the shoulder strap correctly. It's not intuitive (at least for me) and there are no specific instructions on how to attach it.
4,"Good vacuum, kinda loud","I like the look of this space-age machine. It seems like something Gerge Jetson might fly in. It seems to work very well and the attachments fit in well, and are the appropriate shape for cleaing my computer which is why I bought it. My only complaint is that it is quite loud. While that isn't going to stop me from using it in general, I don't think I would use it late in the day, because it would bother the neighbors. It would also sorely bother someone on the phone, in the next cubicle, or having a conversation in the next room."
1,"Hormel Swirl Design Carafe, 40 oz., white","This is a really, really lousy product. First, it doesn't keep the coffee very hot. Then, it drips, but not just onto the countertop. It drips down and gets caught in a horizontal seam around the widest part of its ""belly,"" where it creates a dark brown stain, so that the carafe always looks dirty. So, you have lukewarm coffee in a messy container. Unfortunately, you can't get your money back, because you bought it through Amazon, which doesn't vouch for its products."
1,HOR402264B - Poly Lined Black Swirl Design Carafe,"I'm very disappointed with this product. One of the main reasons I purchased it was for its volume. Most of the other thermal carafes were too small for my needs. However, this carafe keeps coffee hot for only a short time. I will not purchase any more of this company's product."
2,Not hot,This carafe does not keep coffee hot for very long; 1-2 hours at best. It is good for large groups who drink a lot of coffee quickly.
2,"Nice design, but doesn't keep beverage hot.","This is a very attractive design, but I'm sad to say that the product doesn't keep beverages hot at all. I was so disappointed. I have placed this purchase into a grouping of items I intend to donate to discount stores, and I will use a beat-up Stanley thermos to store my freshly brewed coffee :)"
3,Sticks the landing,Just what I wanted. Does the job. Haven't had any trouble through numerous flat repairs with this cement. The tube's larger and won't fit in previous store-bought patch kit boxes. Pax Rubber Cement Patch Kit Glue Tube Tire is a cent cheaper.
5,I needed this book for a class and it came in no time!,I was amazed at how fast my order went through...I think I received the book three days after placing the order! The book was in amazing condition!
4,A Must-Have for Fans of Gangsta Rap,"In the historical context of hip-hop, N.W.A. should be as celebrated as Run-DMC, the Sugarhill Gang and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 5. Where the latter's ""The Message"" was the first cut to speak to its unintended audience (suburban white kids) about what they didn't see on television regarding urban life, N.W.A. pioneered a prideful disdain of the establishment, and of urban dwellers to simply ""accept"" the caste system in which they lived. The most significant track, ""(...)Tha Police"", was never as honored as ""The Message"", but was just as poignant. I only wish they had included more bona-fide hits, but otherwise a good buy. ""California Love"" is a good add, as is ""Steady Mobbin"", but where's ""EZ Duz It""? The exclusions are what forces me to rate this as less than a '5', but I still highly recommend this 2-CD package."
4,KICK AZZ,"This is maybe the best compilation i have ever heard, it has all of the greatest songs by the best rappers(money well spent!!)."
3,"N.W.A Legacy, Vol. 1",this album was all hyped-up but it aint that great...there needs to be more tracks by actual n.w.a members...and mabye sum new unreleased stuff not all snoops and dre's new stuff from chronic and doggystyle!!
1,MY OPIN?,"Well then, I think it sucks! I wouldn't make a penguin listen to this worthless romanticization of an anti-social jaded view of life. Spooky."
2,OKay if you love those super hard addictive games.,"Honestly ordered this as an add on to get free super saver shipping (as I usually do when ordering on Amazon.com). Honestly nothing wrong with this game. It is insanely difficult(both in controls and in having no clue where to go... ever). The controls are jerky and difficult. It is very hard to understand what the game really expects you to do on any level. I personally got addicted to the game and played probably 30 hours worth without feeling like I accomplished anything. So my only real review I can say is stay away unless you are insanely addictive and competitive. If you just want to prove to yourself you can perfect and beat this game then I would shy away. By the way if you do go through and beat it, you get kudos from me. I had to put it down."
3,kind of a early GTA3,this game is no where near as good as GTA3 but it is kind of like it the controls are set up similarly to tomb raider the game was fun but i didn't like how you had to pass a driving test and a physical test on the game before you could do missions
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"Total [junk], Complete Waste of money-All I have to say.Giving this game a star is a waste of a star."
3,Meh.,It is what it is...a boring textbook on PR ethics. Found it painfully boring to read. Was the content useful? Sure. Are there other PR ethics texts? Yes. Find those.
5,Great Mats,"These mats are great, I recommend these desk mats to anyone for purchase. They keep your desk from becoming scratched."
5,Great Desk Pad!,"I bought two Rhinolin desk pads for my new L-shaped desk. I just love them. They protect the desk while serving as a mousepad, laptop pad, and coffee pad too. It looks neat and very unobtrusive. It's not as thick as ones I have seen, but it is thick enough to protect and write on. I highly recommend Artistic, the seller. I got it so fast and their communication was excellent!"
3,"It's not black, but grey.","This desk pad isn't black at all. It's grey. I have a black mouse, mouse pad, and keyboard, and the colors are so totally different that the pad looks odd."
1,Don't buy,"I purchased two of their mats, but in burgandy (LT67 burgandy). I purchased them four years ago. They worked fine until one day I tried to move them to clean as I had done before and found they were stuck to the tops of my L shaped wood desk. The black foam backing appears to have eaten into the desk finish and much of it could not be removed. Where I was able to remove the black foam the finish underneath was a rough as sandpaper. I called their customer service and was told to send pictures and the receipt, which I did. They never responded. I kept calling until they said there was nothing they would do about the problem. I finally wrote to their head office and never received a reply. I purchased these to protect my new desk and instead they ruined the top of the desk."
4,"A Bit Smaller Than 20""x36""","I'm pleased with this product and intend to keep it. It arrived in good condition. Other buyers may want to know that the product's exact dimensions are: 19.44"" x 35.13""."
3,"It works for me, but it's certainly not heavy duty","When I ordered this item, I was expecting to get a thick, soft rubber desk pad with a foam back. It fulfills my needs which is why I gave it 3 stars. But be aware that the surface is more easily damaged than the product description lets on. The rubber is somewhat hard which means that minor bends (in shipping) will cause a crease that might not release. This also means that the surface is something less than self-healing. For instance, if you take a scissors to it (lightly), the mark will not go away. The backing is difficult to keep clean; being foam, small debris sticks to it easily.Overall, it was a good purchase, but the product could definitely be better."
4,It looks good and works,It instantly made the desk look better. Allows us to remove the mouse pad. I like. A little bit much for what it actually is though.
5,Exactly what I wanted,This product was exactly what I ordered and was packaged very well. It doesn't slide and covers a large area of my desk. It's like a huge mouse pad and eliminates the need for one. Love it.
4,Great Shape / good material,"This item is a little wider and less tall than most, giving great coverage. Surface makes hand writing better/easier. Easy to tuck things under edge and holds shape. Shows marks, but not bad. most things can be rubbed out without even cleaning. Very pleased. Office desk looks/works much better."
1,Terrible packaging,"This product needs to be packaged much better than it was. When it arrived, it was filled with dust and sand. Had to spend a good bit of time cleaning it."
3,"Not great, but the best I can find","I read a lot of complaints about the self-destructing foam that's on the bottom of this desk pad. Mine has not started to fall apart yet (I've had it for a few months) but it's very very delicate and I won't be at all surprised to see that happen. I'm assuming the purpose of the foam is to prevent the pad from sliding around my desk, but it isn't very effective -- the pad still slides around pretty easily. I think a very thin layer of neoprene might work a lot better.The writing surface (top) of this desk pad seems fine. It's kind of hard and feels almost like plastic, but it looks nice enough.I would gladly pay more for a higher quality version of this pad, but I can't find anything else that will work."
3,Not what you might expect,"A bit disappointed in this book. The ""training schedules"" aren't exactly helpful at all, mainly b/c it's just a review, and at times, very vague as to what to do. Freeman breaks down some of the science in peaking strategies in a somewhat clear manner, but after reading this, I was left saying to myself what a waste of money. It's more of a collection of optimale training speeds, and theories (such as daniels etc. etc.), but it truly lacks detail as to how to appropriately put into practice."
4,Badass Aussie Metal,"Daysend (Pronounced Days-end) is another fantastic metal band I discovered listening to the internet radio of Chronix-Agression.(www.chronixradio.com) I was impressed by them the 1st time I heard Born is the Enemy, and was equally blown away by the second song I heard by them, the relentlesly heavy, Blood of Angels.The members of the band all came from well-regarded underground Sydney metal bands, and assembeled Daysend in 2002. Severance was voted Best Australian Metal Album in a Triple J listeners poll in late 2003. Pick this album up and you won't be dissapointed..."
3,blood of angels,"this cd is hella awesome!my favorite song on it is blood of angels.here is another really great band called Mnemic.you should check out their new cd,The Audio Injected Soul,it's pretty sic.i love the chrus',especially the one on the song dreamstate emergency,that's my favorite song,and it is the 1 i heard about them from on the music choice channel on digital cable.that's where ive heard of alot of my underground bands."
4,Time for Business,"I needed a watch appropriate for business attire - this one fills the bill - nice clean, masculine look - not too heavy or ostentatious."
4,Mas Jazz,"Another solid Jazz album from the Mexico scene, Heberto Castillo is a classic Jazz trio with Castillo on Piano, Gonzalo Gonzales on Drums, & Enrique Valadez on Bass their slant tends to take a classical side much like the American ""The Great Jazz Trio"" band. Imagenes is an album of original compositions that pay deference to Debussy.Otro album solido de la onda Jazzista mexicana, Heberto Castillo is el tipico trio de Jazz con Castillo en Piano, Gonzales en la Bateria y Valadez en Contrabajo. El grupo tiene tendencia a musica clasica muy parecido a ""The Great Jazz Trio."" Imagenes es un album de compociones originales que hacen referencia a la obra de Debussy."
4,"a fascinating study of ""leadership"" in the world","Needless to say, there are a multitude of leadership books out there. However, ""Real Leadership"" was unique. I found it readable and full of interesting examples about leadership on both the governmental and individual level. Williams has had fascinating experiences as a consultant in various countries, and I appreciated the insights shared.If you're like me and fascinated by human behavior and leadership, then I recommend this book."
5,Bringing context into the leadership equation,"Dean William's remarkable book tackles a subject almost completely ignored by most management courses and books on leadership. Context matters when deciding what are the most appropriate responses leaders can have to different situations. His insight about the five different leadership challenges--from crisis to development--creates a taxonomy that is not only useful, but also provides the reader (an aspiring leader) with practical diagnostic and interventional tools. His examples and case studies support his thesis that these different challenges are not dependent upon culture, but on three universal dimensions: The condition of the people, the barrier to overcome, and the promise on the other side. Not only do I use these insights in my own work, I have successfully integrated it leadership development courses on several continents."
4,An excellent read!,A superb book by Mary Wibberly. I have read a number of her books and this is another great read. The characters were great. When I started reading I could stop!! If you have read any of her other books and liked them this is a must!!
1,LapWorks Laptop Legs,"I found this product to be essentially useless. After finding an area on the bottom of my laptop that would leave the battery free to remove, I attached the legs. It kept the laptop elevated, but also not well balanced when it was open. After a week or so, the adhesive broke down and the legs fell off."
2,Weak suction,"This vacuum is only good for very small jobs such as cleaning the keyboard or car console. It does not have much suction strength, thus if used for sl. larger jobs it will have trouble picking up most things. The handset does not weigh very much (which is great while using it) but becomes a problem on the charger as it is not heavy enough to stay in contact to continue charging. I have to use a large rubber band around the unit to keep the charging probes in contact.)"
3,Pleased For The Price!,"I originally ordered this cordless vac to clean out the lint compartment of my dryer. When I recieved the product,to my surprise it was way smaller than what was expected. Although it was too small to do the job intended,I still found use for it!"
2,cordless vacuum,"I purchased this hand vacuum to carry with me when I go to restaurants and there are flies trying to get on my food. The plan was to vacuum up the flies as they were near me or my food. However, the inlet area is only about a half inch in diameter so I have not caught a fly yet. I was hoping that the inlet would be something like the dirt devil that plugs into car power source, which is about 1"" by 3"" in size and would be easy to catch the flies. I am still looking for a cordless vacuum with a larger inlet area for this purpose."
1,LOOK AROUND BEFORE BUYING THIS ONE!!,"THIS HAND VAC WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED CONSIDERING I SEEN THE MINI ONE AND I FOUND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE SMALL ONE-NEEDLESS TO SAY I RECIEVED IT YESTERDAY AND WAS TOTALLLLYYY SHOCKED AT HOW TINY THIS IS! I HAVE 2 KIDS AND 1 ON THE WAY AND I LITERALLY WOULD HAVE TO EMPTY THIS 8 TIMES NO JOKE IN ORDER TO CLEAN THE FLOORS OF MY CAR!! THOS MIGHT BE PERFECT FOR AN OLDER PERSON WHO MAKES TINY MESSES AND WHO CANT LUG A BIG VACUUM AROUND!! I TRIED IT JUST TO BE CERTAIN IT WASNT JUST THE SIZE THAT I WASNT HAPPY WITH AND IT WOULDNT SUCK UP ANYTHING, SO I SENT IT BACK FOR A REFUND THAT IM GOING TO USE TO BUY A BIGGER AND BETTER!! HOPE THIS HELPS!"
1,Good for a laugh,"My girlfriend and I laughed for several minutes at how terrible of a gift this was. Seriously. Good for cleaning... nothing? Literally no suction, loud little fan does nothing. Tried cleaning my keyboard (with keys removed mind you) and this product did practically nothing to the crumbs and hair. Don't waste your money."
3,Pricey for the small power,Bought this for my wife to use on her sewing machines. Just not much power or suction. Would not buy again. Mather adapters for your regular vac while not as convenient work much better.
4,Power To Suck,"up the dirt is definitely present...many provided a negative review, not sure why. Inexpensive, like to use in kitchen for crumbs, especially around toaster."
2,Should have paid more attention to size and weight,"This is probably my fault for not reading more carefully but I thought this would be a good vacuum for my car, to clean the upholstery and floor as well as the mats. It is actually a mini size which would be ok for a computer keyboard but nothing else that I could use it for so needless to say, I was very disappointed."
2,Uggg Pilling,I washed these sheets approximately 6 times before they started pilling. Good sheet ought to last a LOT longer than that
1,does not work,"I have an erasing machine just like this one that is over 10 years old and still working fine--nothing like it. Ordered two more but the chuck size is different and will not hold the eraser in place. The eraser either flies out or slides back into the machine. I wrapped a rubber band around the chuck to see if this will work. I know of no other eraser still available that is plug in and as powerful as this one so I am reluctant to return. I have the rechargeable version but it doesn't hold a charge long enough--I sometimes work for several hours at a time. If the rubber bands work I will stock up and if not, I need to return.Bummer!"
1,Very short lifespan,"We bought one of these for work as we do quite a bit of erasing. We had an older model from this company for quite a very long time and finally the motor was wearing out and we needed to replace it. This one lasted only 3 months at most. The motor still runs, but the eraser tip has become disconnected from the motor rendering it useless. Find a different eraser than this, it's not worth the price."
1,Poor Product,"I work for Michigan State University and purchased this eraser to erase marks from historic aerial imagery. The eraser was basically useless. The chuck that holds the eraser did not work right out of the box. We modified it by adding a rubber band so that it would hold the eraser in place. In the first day, the eraser quit working and was very temperamental. Also, the eraser sends chunks of eraser particles flying all over the workspace. Overall, the eraser is useless."
5,Surrendering to the sweet love,"Two thumbs up for this wonderful story about two successful african-americans, who can't help but to surrender to the power of love. Beautiful Hayden Campbell seeks drop dead gorgeous Cannon Factor's help locating assistance for her ailing father. Cannon doesn't know at the time but he needs Hayden's help just as much to tone down his playboyish persona. Check it out for yourself, I urgently await the next novel by Ms. Winters."
5,Great intro to Afro-Cuban rythyms and hand percussion,"I previously bought Brad Dutz' DVD (at the suggestion of the guy who sold me my bongos) and found it to be worthless; geared towards children and with MINIMAL instructions; in contrast, on this DVD, Ricardo breaks it all down to basics on bongos, claves, congas, timbales and does it clearly and simply. This an excellent introduction to the rhythms and instruments that have captured my attention and excite me to play. I can't really imagine one being better. If you're starting out, like me, you can't go wrong with Ricardo's DVD."
1,Very disappointed,"I really expected a hell of a lot more from Berkley Schools. It appears that the Dean of the school must have made the percussion instructor agree to put out something, anything to make the school money. It is painfully obvious that the teacher is not interested in making a video. I'm sure he is a fine musician in his own right, but I would never want to be in his class. You know what they say, if you can't do, teach.Video is not worth the money."
3,COINTELPRO papers review,"This is a detailed review of available FBI documents relating to subversive and dissident groups as defined in the wake of the McCarren / Mccarthyism era and deemed a threat to the US interest. Alarming material shows how the FBI framed and planted ""evidence"" in order to control and destroy elements in a supposed free society. A good read for a political and intelligence analysts in the ever changing and modern world."
3,A book I wish I never needed,"Male breast cancer is an unusual occurance. I was lucky and was diagnosed and treated early. This book is one of the few references on the condition. I do not think it is a great book, but it does offer some useful information."
2,it's horrible,"when i got mr nuts i thought it would be fun but when i played it i couldn't get past the second level. the thing wouldn't let me move, i showed my little cousin and she had the same problem, i also showed it to my older cousin, who says he's the master at all games, couldn't get past this one spot."
2,Lens kit for small cahnge!,The contents of the kit were as advertised but the clear plastic containing the 'stuff' was yellowed on arrival. It may have been old inventory. It works OK but... it should include an airbrush. It's good to save some cash but you do get what you pay for with this item!
2,Poor Value,"It does the job but the included ""pre-moistened"" pads are a waste and are are quickly gone.Instead, stop by Costco and get the eye glass cleaning kit for $5.95. Comes with atomiser x 2 (small and large) lint free cleaning cloth. Best, cleaning solution refills are free forever at the Costco store. The solution is GREAT. Best lens cleaner I've used. No carry case but hey, a small zip lock works fine."
2,"works, but barely","I'd never purchased a lens cleaner before this, but I couldn't recommend the Nikon Complete Lens Cleaner Kit to anyone.Right from the get-go, I had problems. The package construction is shoddy - the velcro 'button' fell off the FIRST time I opened it! The cleaning spray is way too gushy, and you do spend a lot of time cleaning up/rubbing out the mess. The moist towelettes (that's really what they are) work surprisingly well, no streaks at all As Advertised - but you may still need compressed air to get it spotless."
2,Nikon lense cleaning kit,The pieces of this kit work well -especially the cloth and liquid. Unfortuantesly it did not come with the case as advertised and seller thought I should contact the manufacturer to get it. I did get a refund.I was lookjing for a kit to take hiking in the mountians..
2,Leaves the lens worse than when you started.,I don't know if it is the liquid or the towel (lent) or whatever. I was never happy with this product. It just spreads the dust or fingerprints all over the lens and I still need to use more cleaning maneuvers to get rid of the dirt or dust. My best luck with cleaning my lenses was with a combination of the Air Blower and the pen brush-lens restoration pin. The lens manual always advises none contact cleaning as any scrubbing against your lens can damage it and this always start with good quality air blower. I find myself doing more scrubbing after using this kit than I would if I stuck with the Air blower and the brush pin.
2,Basic Cleaning Option,"As noted in other reviews, this is a small kit and is a little underwhelming. You can find something generic at Best Buy just as easily."
3,"It works, but poor value","I read the other reviews before buying this. I don't regret the purchase but will not purchase again. I view this package as an introductory package of sorts. If you don't have much to clean, and only need to clean your lens occasionally, then this is probably okay. This package comes with ""everything"", but there is very little of ""everything"". Use this to learn, to try what ""good enough"" cleaning supplies look/feel like. I ended up using different cleaning solutions and cleaning clothes that I bought separately, and a lenspen to get rid of any residual film/haze."
3,OK product but not worth the price,"When I buy subscription glasses at local opticals, I get a bottle of cleaning liquid and a piece of cloth for free. But I had to pay over $10 for this Nikon kit which is basically the same things plus three non-reusable cleaning tissues."
2,Disappointed!,The item was recieved in a damaged box because it was shipped in a soft envelope not in a box. The items was not worth what I paid!
2,no carry case,"My kit came in a flimsy cardboard box, not a reusable carrying case. You can get a better kit for half the price at Costco stores."
3,Nothing spesial,Pretty simple fabric and lens Cleaning liquid. Don't think it is any different from glasses store products.
4,"gr8, except for the price","The cleaner kit works perfectly and I'd give it a 5 star, but for the price. One can purchase pretty much the same solution in an eyeglass cleaner, and for Much cheaper."
2,"so so quality kit, high price","What you you are basically getting is a very expensive glasses cleaning kit from which you can get for half the price at Walmart and friends. The moist lens cleaning cloth is good to keep in your camera bag for emergency cleaning, but mine came a bit dried out. Microfiber cloth is excellent quality. I would not purchase again though."
2,Nikon Complete Lens Cleaner Kit,"This is an overpriced and disappointing product. It does not even come with a plastic bag to keep it in. The box is thin cardboard that will soon be useless. The result will be that the cleaning cloth will soon pick up grit and lint. It comes with nice one-use premoistened lens cleaning cloths, but there are only three of them! They will be great for emergency field use, but 3 will not last very long. The spray cleaner works well, but it has a large apray pattern. The result is that you end up spraying your camera in addition to the lens. All in all, a disappointment. Nikon almost always does things well, but they missed the boat on this one."
4,Season 4 still hilarious until Reggie leaves and DVR issues easily fixed.,"Wicked happy season 4 was finally released and it was magnificent up to the point that Reggie leaves the show and the ultra bland Nancy Travis replaces her. She is horrible and kind of killed the formerly awesome chemistry the cast seemed to have. Hopefully, the on demand process can continue with other great comedies that have yet to appear in DVD format such as Still Standing, Yes, Dear and the remaining episodes of King of the Hill. I too had play ""issues"" at first that others have noted but a simple firmware update of my player immediately solved all of the problems and all 3 discs run flawlessly now...well, except for the Travis thing."
1,doesn't play,I HAVE 3 PLACES I CAN PLAY THIS. IT DOESN'T WORK ON ANY OF THEM . GETS TO THE LIST OF EPISODES AND THATS AS FAR AS IT GOES. MOST MADDING.AND ITS TO LATE TO RETURN IT.
4,"Love the show, love the cast.","GREAT DVD, continuing in the tradition of the earlier releasesJohn Becker is impatient as ever, Bob is slimy as usualPlots are original - the one of Becker crashing pancake day was great, and typically John, but as with most eps, the writers go one step further, so there is a surpriseOnly regret is the series stopped and the DVDs take forever to be released."
5,Becker Season 4 DVD-R,"This was my first purchase of a DVD-R product, and it works very well. I would like to have a ""Play All"" function, but can manage without it. This is a funny season, that lags a bit when Reggie leaves, but is still better than most sitcoms."
5,Geat,"I got this DVD for Christmas, and i have to say i am very impressed.It looks very professional, it has CBS logos on it and everything. I also love the special features.So overall this was a great buy. I recommend this and thank my Mom for getting it for me.I cannot wait for Season 5 and Season 6 dvd releases. I hope they are made soon!!!"
2,Great show but disc manufacturing took a step backwards,"I love this show, always have. Even though I'm not very fond of Manufacture on Demand, it'll have to do. What I do NOT like about this particular one is that there is no PLAY ALL. Each episode has to be selected one at a time. Therefore, the rating is for the manufacturing, not the show."
3,Ok but 1 of the 3 DVDs didn't play in my DVD player.,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Becker. I ordered the 1st,2nd & 3rd season set they worked great plus I have the option of watching the entire DVD or selecting my episode. When I saw the 4th season I purchased it right away. 2 of the DVDs played in my DVD player but the 3rd of Season 4 did not. I was very disappointed. The DVD does work b/c it played in my laptop. However I don't want to watch it on my laptop. I didn't like that and Season 4 doesn't provide the option of watching the entire DVD you have to play episode by episode, what a disappointment."
3,Will MOD play on my computer or DVD recorder??,I'm so glad to see this release! Been waitin' quite awhile for this season to finally show up. But the fact that they're MOD discs is worrying me. The description says MOD may not play on ur computer's drive or DVD recorder.Does anyone have any experience with MOD discs?? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!!
1,1 out of 3 ain't good.,"I don't recommend this season of DVDs due to their malfunction. Discs 1 and 2 of season 4 are defective and cannot be played. Disc 3 appears to be playing fine so far. I played Seasons 1-3 (sold separately as a set) without a problem. I bought the 4th season separately. Season 4 is packaged differently and the on-screen menu looks different which may indicate a different manufacturer. Seasons 1-3 have the Paramount logo on the spine of the DVD case. Season 4 does not. I would suggest searching for a different manufacturer, if possible. I have not done that yet."
3,defective dvds,"Brand new dvd set of the fourth season of tv show Becker, still sealed and the very first disc kept sticking and wouldn't play!! Missed a lot of the episodes!! Very disappointed since had been waiting for years for this item and only Amazon had it."
1,Could not view DVD,"I love the TV show Becker and although it was a bit pricey I ordered it from America. Firstly I had to pay an extra 12.60 on the customs charges and when I got it home I discovered it would not play on my Blue Ray player.Enough said, I was not very happy !!!Barrythehat"
3,First 3 seasons are 5 stars .. but when Nancy Travis joins ... Ugggh,"We loved BECKER and think the first three seasons (and half of season 4) are classic comedy gold.But now watching Season 4 again on DVD, I remember why our love for the show faded.Something was lost in the magic when Nancy Travis joined the show.THEN when both Regie and Bob were lost, that was the end.I don't know what it is, but we really hated the Nancy Travis character on this show and feel the chemistry of the cast fell apart after she joined.The DVD on demand plays fine although the main menu does not advance to the next show automatically , there is no PLAY ALL option and the discs sound a little louder than normal DVDs when spinning in the player"
2,BLACK BOX,"I really like Becker so I will keep this release as there may not be another but, I am very disappointed in the technical release of this set. The stupid black rectangle box appears in the Ex-Files episode. I already had that with the copy I made from a tv showing. And no controls on the dvd to change Viewing rating. Becker the show, 10 stars out of 5. Who ever put this dvd release together 1 star. Personal note: if Becker was a real doctor and lived near me, I would search him out to be my doctor. I did love the Sizzle reel, the cast interviews, the audience warm up reel, and the gag reel. Sure I could have said extras or special features but this gives more information, Those I give 5 stars. I have not watched all the set yet but if it is as good as what I have watched it will not be a downer for me, except the black rectangular box. For the record ""The Pilot"" and ""Subway Story"" are my two favorites of the series, but I liked them all."
5,SO HAPPY TO FIND THIS,"Becker has always been one of my favorite TV shows and I was thrilled when they started to release the seasons on DVD even though they were released about a year apart. I didn't think season 4 would ever come out ... ran across this while looking for other sitcoms. In my opinion, there we no bad Becker episodes ... they were all hilarious!"
2,Not the same as they used to be,"I have two white Russell Athletic Mens T's and really like them, not sure where I originally got them but they are very nice. I wanted some additional ones so I searched for them online and was pleased that I found them on Amazon. Online, they looked just like the ones I have, they even have the logo on the sleve, so I ordered 5. The t-shirts I received are not the same as the ones I have in my drawer. The new ones are much thinner. They are not bad t-shirts, just typical t-shirts that you buy three to a pack at the discount store, The older ones are thicker, smoother and have survived my abuse. Don't buy these if you are looking to duplicate the previous version."
2,Collar,"A t-shirt is only as good as it's collar, and this one is pretty weak. That said, it's an 8-dollar t-shirt, which is about as cheap as it gets.Sizes seem to run a bit big, at least the Large does."
5,65HD1 Excellent Performer,"I have had this set since Jan 00, one of the firsts delivered. Performance spectacular especially with HDTV from DirecTV. People continue to be amazed at the picture quality with over the air HDTV, DirecTV and D-VHS prerecoded movies.This is a sophisticated unit and you should not trust anyone but the Sony Factory Repair in Home service if you have a problem. All new TVs are getting to be too complicated for the local shops and furthermore they cannot afford the sophisticated test equipment necessary to repair a unit if it fails."
1,HDTV--Why???,"Okay, I am a commisioned salesperson who deals with TV's (HDTV included), and despite what I get for one, I cannot recomend one of these TVS. HDTV supports 1200+ lines of resolution, that's nice but guess what? The best video equipment is a DVD player which puts out a max of 950 lines of resolution. Why buy this TV? It is a waste of 10,000 bucks. Wanna nice TV? Get the Wega because until everyone starts brodcasting in High Definition (about 2005), that TV is just a nice big paper weight."
2,Buy HDTV for Best Video Experience,"DVD is NOT the ""Best Video Equipment"" out. It may have been 2-3 years ago but it has been surpassed. HDTV is being broadcast both by local TV stations in MANY cities and if you are not fortunate enough to live in one of those cities you can chose from some of the Satellite HBO HDTV options available. Best Buy has HDTV Satellite Receivers for sale for use with DirectTV and you can purchase PPV movies in HDTV or watch HBO in HDTV at 1080i resolution. Superior to DVD quality."
3,Just a rip off or a true party CD??,"After buying this CD and listening to it, I thought it was pretty good! Although none of the songs are sung by the original artists, I think that it was a pretty good mix of songs. After I read the other ratings for this CD though, I was kind of dissapointed. They put it down too much, and didnt look at the good parts of it. I felt that the makers of the CD did a pretty good job re-doing the songs! So, if you're looking for a CD with the original songs sung by the original artists, I would not recommend buying this. However, if you are the kind of person that doesnt really care who it is sung by, and just want the song, I would recommend this CD! If you buy it, I hope you enjoy it!"
2,No dramatic tension,"I could not really care about any of the characters in this novel as their motivations were so far removed from reality that I could not identify with them. The concept of ghosts managed to destroy any dramatic tension, as any time a character was in danger my reaction was ""so what?"" If that character were killed they would just generate another version of him or her, so the fact that he or she dies means nothing."
2,too far-out for me,"I love books like this, and thought I would love Vast (my first Nagata). But I had to put it down after about 25% of the way through. The characters were all so alien, that I couldn't relate to any of them. The ""hard-science"" was so futuristic, that it wasn't even plausible -- and no attempt to explain it. I can't recommend this book, but I will try other books by Nagata and hope this was just a fluke. :-)"
4,"Different, hard, fascinating","One of the great things about SF is how it gives you new concepts to think about. You know, spice-giving sandworms (Dune), a sea of grass (Hyperion), a cylindrical sea (Rama). This one has spun a world around communicating with chemicals. There are others concepts too - humans genetically adapted to life in a vaccum, minds uploaded to machines with multiple instantiations (""ghosts""). It's good hard SF. Sometimes a bit too hard, but I found it well-worth the read. I will probably also read Deception Well soon."
3,Decent sci-fi,"I was at a complete disadvantage with this book because I had not read the previous books in the series. Still, the characters were well developed, the plot was decent, and the scenarios were well-imagined. My advice is to read the other books first; I imagine I would have enjoyed this one much more."
3,Too far out!,"I love 'hard' science fiction. In my view, this book could have been 'harder' but for the fact that it's storyline is set too far into the future for my taste and thus 'fantasy' creeps in. However, it is still a good read, with nanotech portrayed in a very interesting light."
2,annoying buzzing sound when running at 1280x1024,"I had high hopes for this monitor. However, I encountered several problems. When trying to run at 1280x1024, the monitor would always emit an annoying buzzing sound whenever there was a lot of white color on the screen. This did not happen at higher or lower resolutions and was independent of how many colors were being displayed. I had to downgrade the refresh rate to 75Hz from 85Hz to make this sound go away.Second, color purity was not consistent across the screen. Colors on the left side of the screen appeared different than on the right side. Trying the various control settings did not help.I'm probably going to return this monitor."
3,Monitor loses sync sporadically after 2 years of use,"After using this monitor for a couple of years, this monitor starts losing sync sporadically. The losing of sync is not caused by the video adapter as this happens with two difference video adapters."
3,An OK CRT,"The FE950 is a decent monitor.It takes too long to startup (slow charging) and takes forever to sync to a new resolution setting. It also takes forever to turn off.The CRT coating is excellent as there's almost zero glare but the quality is lackluster. The text and graphics are NOT crisp and I find myself squinting to see graphics clearly.Overall I would not give it a STRONG BUY rating but rather give it a OK BUY rating. If you find one on sale for dirt cheap prices, go for it."
1,dont bother ordering the kindle version,"The kindle version does not have anyway to access the software required to do the lessosn in this book. If you order the fersion with the cd it comes with a pdf version. So with the paperback, you get the book, the cd, and the digital book, with the kindle, you get a digital version that references stuff even encase wont assist you with"
2,The DVD software is full of errors...,"Bought the book some 3 weeks ago and had gone through the entire book.The contents are good and beneficial, but the provided evaluation Encase version 5 is not working properly.Many of the exercises stated in the book cannot be carried out because those necessary features needed are not activated in the provided software. But the book said the provided software is constructed for us to go through all the exercises in preparation for the Phase II practical test.Wrote a complaint to the publisher and they acknowledged the errors in the software but then they do nothing to resolve it...I sort of feeling being cheated and it seems like it is a strategy they are using to force us to spend the huge sum of money to buy the commercial Encase software."
3,Software and evidence files are not working,"I love the reading of this book but, the software doesn't work. I have read the ""ReadMe"" note that says to drag and drop the files directly into the cases pane. I do that and always come back with a message saying ""Drag and Drop is Not Available in this Version"". Also, my ""Add Device"" ""Add Raw Image"" are both dimmed and unusable, so I cannot get the evidence files into EnCase that way. And the entire Edit menu at the top is unavailable. I understand this is an evaluation copy so I'm not supposed to be able to use it all but if you cannot even get the included evidence files into the included software that renders the software as useless."
1,Horrible!!!! I would not give it any stars if I could,"This book was horrible!!!! If you can help it DO NOT get it!!! This book contradicts itself all the time.It introduces WAY too many concepts into one chapter and doesn't explain them enough. The way it is written is hard to understand at times. If you absolutely HAVE to read it, then don't read the summary at the end of each chapter because it contradicts itself and gets you confused for no reason. It is an okay reference point for basic reports but not a good book to read cover to cover. Don't waste your money it is WAY overpriced!"
3,Decent textbook,"It is definitely an interesting read. It worked well for my wintermester Criminology class. The chapters, however, were disorganized. The research and policy ""sections"" should have been sectioned off from the theory sections and the others topics. The newly added chapters had little information in their 6 pages. Since this is a new edition, the new chapters should have been lengthy and informative. I don't remember those two chapters being applied to research or policy."
5,Gives you that unplugged feel!,"If you loved the Joe Cocker's cd ""Organic"", then you will be on cloud nine with this Dvd concert recorded in 1996. Joe and his band are recorded in an unplugged atmosphere in a small Austin city limits like studio making for a great intimate setting that was taped during a stopover in Germany promoting his organic cd. Jim Keltner plays a fabulous set on drums and Chris Stainton is forever the keyboard maestro who helps define the Joe Cocker sound. The sound quality is nothing short of fantastic and Joe is once again in fine vocal form belting out ""Delta Lady"", ""Sail Away"", ""Bye Bye Blackbird"", ""Can't Find My Way Home"", and a great cover of Dylan's ""Dignity"" just to name a few. After the first viewing all I could say was WOW, this is great stuff. A must for any Joe Cocker fan who needs some unplugged R&B."
4,Joe Cocker - In Concert,Not as good as his Midnight Tour but finding Joe Cocker DVD's is almost impossible so I was thrilled to be able to buy one at all. He's still a unique singer and totally enjoyable.
1,"Stay away, far away.","This thing ain't worth the [money maount]+ asking price. You're better off getting a portable CD player with the same options (minus the clock) and some mini-speakers. The speakers have no bass and and are very tinny. The CD player worked for about a week and now it stutters almost all the time, usually less when you turn the anti-shock setting off. It's all eye-candy."
1,Garbage,"Unfortunately, my husband bought this piece of junk well before I'd had a chance to read any reviews. I think it's all been said before, but this CD player is a complete rip-off, and an expensive rip-off at that! We were wondering why we only got a couple hours out of a set of batteries, but apparently it's not just us; the problem is inherent in this poor excuse for a CD player. And if you still think you might like to buy one, you can have mine. I'm going to buy something that works."
2,Anti-shock makes CD worthless,"I purchased this to wake up to a CD. It takes 40+ seconds to fill the buffer for the anti-shock system. During this time, the CD stutters. Extrememly annoying. You can shut the anti-shock system off, but only after it begins playing. By that time I'm awake and irritated.Other than that, I like it."
3,versatile but problem prone,"When it works, it works very well. My first unit would not play cd's on a consistant basis. It was replaced by merchant. The 2nd unit worked very well for 5 months after which it no longer read a cd or mp3cd. It is interesting than the owner's manual does NOT note that mp3cd's are playable; only standard cd's. The speakers are a joke, but the included headphone produce a great sound. They become uncomfortable after 1-2 hours and the cord is very short. This unit was used by an age 50+ consumer with no misuse and was cleaned regularly. The radio's tuner is weak as FM stations 20 miles+ away were audible only on mono."
1,Unreliable clump of dung,"I was given this for Christmas. I would have to say that every other time that I put either a disc into this it gives me a problem. Either the songs skip or, if it is an mp3 disc, it may just spin without the playback starting. Sometimes if I take the disc out and re-insert it it will play, sometimes not. This is an unreliable clump of dung."
2,Skip this one...,I have been a fan of Tae Bo since it came out forever ago and while Billy is not the best cue'er or the best transition'er he usually makes up for it with the fun and intensity of the workout. But this is is way beyond repair-- and to top it off the production value is way sub par...
2,Hilarious,"Ohh wow , how did i ended up buying this dvd ( billy blanks LMAo) it is just hilarious his outfit lmao . yes I know ,, we are here to work out ; do cardio ; burning fat and raise your heart rate but I personally found this so funny it doesn't even transition smoothly . If i see the mailman with another creditor's bill I would run for my life that would surely raise my heart rate up. Just wasted another $9.00 i could had save those $9 + $9 and gotten me something I'm actually going to love like bob harper ."
2,lousy product,"i bought this blanket, which appeared to work quite well in the early going. But the blanket ""sheds"", meaning that little tufts of cloth seem to fall of of the blanket and get everywhere. all over my room, all over my clothes... my blanket was blue, so i had little blue stuffings everywhere.then i tried to wash it as directed, but the blanket's stitching quality is poor, so the blanket got ripped in the washing machine, on gentle cycle no less, and the wiring was everywhere. i had to throw it away.as far as heating goes, the heating component worked well, but the wires were so far apart from each other in the blanket itself. So it was like any other blanket.i am not satisfied with this product and would not by another sunbeam again."
1,Save your money,"I bought this blanket a year ago. When I first used it...it worked fine...I carefully packed it away for the summer. Now winter is here again, put it on the bed...and no heat what so ever....I will never buy Sunbeam again...."
1,Hot and Then Cold,This blanket worked fine the first few weeks...then it stopped. Now it only heats up near the end where the connections are. The other 2/3 of the blanket are as cold as my feet.
3,Only Lacking More...,"Simic has selected a fine array of poetry for this volume. The only problem is that the volume suffers from lack of ambition. There are simply not enough poets represented nor poems representative of Serbian writing. Otherwise, I loved this book, but I felt it needed to be more expansive.Overall this is an excellent overview. Particularly I note the poet Ivan Lalic (and the exquisite poem ""Love in July"") and also the poet Novica Tadic who employs rather disturbing and disconnected imagery in his poetry. Most interesting (and well known) is the poem entitled ""Jesus."" Brief but thought provoking.Deserving of praise, this volume, as stated, needs to be of greater length."
1,Not the Italy I know,"I have to admit that this is the first interior design book I ever bought and got absolutely nothing out of it. No inspiration and certainly no idea how Italian people live.Not that I do not know how Italian people live, as I spent years in Italy and visited every region from the Piedmont to Sicily and was invited in palazzi and masserie belonging to owners of every income and creative level.This books paints a picture of Italy's interiors of being all antique and rustique. Italian designers are about the most modern and leading ones in the world and most Italians I met integrate these modern designs in their homes. Even if the house is a thousand years old you will usually find some very modern furniture, lamps or decorations in it.I have seen more interesting rooms, houses, exteriors in the cities and villages I visited than the ones shown in this book. And there is no major city and no region in Italy I have not visited. This book was a huge disappointment for me."
3,Thicker than I thought,"Overall a nice watch. A little chunkier than I like. The luminescent hands don't work well - you can't tell the time in the dark without straining. Still, I think I'll keep it."
1,important topic,"Urban sprawl in American cities is an important topic, but this book doesn't cover it fairly or accurately. Broad assumptions and causalities are asserted and ""proved"" with anecdotal evidence. Facts are also wrong (p. 28 about densities of cities), or cited without the actual data. The underlying theme appears to be that all American cities function (or disfunction) in the same way and can all be fixed by imposing regional planning and equity redistribution."
5,"new york notebook is brilliant, unusual & super fresh guide","new york notebook doesn't remotely resemble any other new york city guidebook. it's really a labor of love: love of illustration, love of design and typography, and love for the city of new york. the places and tips in its pages are sometimes quirky and sometimes practical, but always presented in a funny and colorful style.it's a wildly creative gift book for anyone interested in new york."
4,Good Music - not as good as the show!,"I agree with Evka - the CD is good in its own right, but certainly doesn't measure up to the cast performance! Where did you find the cast recording - I called Nederlander, and they had no idea what I was talking about."
1,A disgrace to classical music.,"How could they dare!!! who told them they can destroy Verdi's work making it become a cheap piece of popular, comercial trash? Please, spare the great masters for people who can really apreciate their work, don't mess with them."
2,It's not that great,"Okay, well, I don't consider it total blasphemy as some people do, but a lot of the songs are pretty weak. The best are the Spice Girls' Motown pastiche ""My Strongest Suit,"" Tina Turner's soulful ""East As Life"" and Kelly Price's passionate ""The Gods Love Nubia."" But most of the rest of it is forgettable and dull at best or crass at worst. Tim Rice's lyrics cannot compare to Bernie Taupin's best, and Elton John's tunes are really rather pedestrian. If you're into Elton or cheesy broadway shows, go ahead and get it, but otherwise it'll just collect dust on your shelf."
4,Works on its own. This is NOT the Verdi work and that's okay,Don't confuse this with the opera cuz it's not it. That's okay. The CD is a good listen and never claims to re-tell Verdi's version. It is only based on the same story as Verdi's so you really CAN'T compare the two.
4,Fine variety album,"Hi, I am lucky - I live in Japan and this album came out here a week before its release date in the US. AS an Elton fan, it is hard not to like his songs, but I was pleasantly surprised at the great mix of artists. This is NOT the cast album, rather several superstars recording the fine music. Recommended!"
3,Gota See This Show Live,"My wife and I went to see Aida while it was in Chicago for it's pre-broadway premier. We loved it but agree with many of the reviews, that the cast recording will be much better. Heather Headley definately makes the show with her beautiful voice, unfortuneatly she's only on a few songs. If you have a chance to see Aida, you won't be disappointed."
5,Evarything as expected,"Everything went as expected. The used CD I ordered was delivered promptly and was in like-new condition, as advertised. If the need ever arose, I would definitely buy from this vendor again."
3,Broadway version's better!,"I really liked the broadway version much better, although this cd is pretty good. The broadway cast recording was recorded around April 11th, and its supposed to be on cd in June, at least that's what the merchants inside the theater said."
5,Not for the narrow minded,"Typical first listen: Skip track one after about ten seconds Listen to track two Repeat track two about a hundred times Finally move on to track three Skip tracks three & four Quite like track five, keep on going Skip track 6 Get stuck again, track 7 is just beautiful Track 8, another over and over and over again song Skip skip skip skipThe next few times you can't be bothered skipping tracks, lo and behold those songs you skipped are actually quite catchy once you get used to them, several of them definitely un-skippableThis is a great CD, worth getting for any of tracks 2, 7, 8, or 10 alone. Yes some of it is a bit of a laugh, but enjoyable at the same time. Appetite is definitely whet for the Cast Recording. Unmissable if you are a fan of Elton John, Tim Rice and/or Disney music. Worth a try if you're not."
4,Worth waiting for!,"I can't say that the CD is bad. I listened to a few samples and like what they did with the music. But if its Broadway you are looking for, I suggest that you wait for the cast recording. I saw the play on Broadway yesterday, opening day, and it was everything I could have asked for and more! The voices of the cast are phenomenal and while this CD has its own special flair it lacks that certain broadway style. Anyone in the New York area can get the cast recording at the Nederlander theatre... the rest of you... I promise its worth waiting for."
4,ORIGINAL,"This cd is great, Elton John and Tim Rice gave total control to the artists to make original fresh versions of the songs. These songs are not suppose to be like the musical, they are suppose to be more in the direction of modern pop music; which they are. On the plus side of this recording are john/rimes duet ""written in the stars"" Tina Turner's dramatic version of ""easy as life"", Turner's voice is in perfect form on this track, very soothing vocals and a soothing song. This is definetly an album to own, for it has a star studded line up ranging from Sting to Janet Jackson...a future classic album."
2,Fantastic show butchered,"After seeing the show and then listening to this album, I have to agree with what appears to be the majority of reviews on this site. The show is incredible, but this album makes most of its music sound either boring or just plain awful or both. Don't bother with this one. Wait for the cast album."
3,Original Soundtrack Would have Been Better,"Saw Aida twice during the Atlanta preview. The two female leads had absolutely incredible voices but are only on two songs that I counted on the CD. Those of you who loved ""My Favorite Suit"" would not believe how much better it was with the original performers. The musical has GREAT potential it is just missing a strong male lead. The male lead songs are wimpy and not memorable. The male lead should not sing like Elton John. There are also some songs in the live version that are such a cacophony that you can't understand a thing. There are some strong points to the CD, but I can't wait for the soundtrack. Until then, I'll just enjoy this one. P.S. I cannot believe how outraged are over the fact that this is an old story being retold in a different genre. For those of us who would never see the opera, this was wonderful!"
3,its good but i cant wait for the cast recording,"personally i dont really like all the artists featured on the album, except that this is elton and tim's work, its DISNEY ,AIDA and its ancient egypt. but i think they r marvellous and would be much better in the original versions. still..its a great buy. its not often albums like this come out. i wish disney will make an animated version of this story.and dont anyone compare this with verdi's aida. both r different types of musical. and Aida is not verdi's story. its just an ancient egypt legend. so stop the lambasting on elton and disney. this album rocks!!and its written in the stars!!!"
2,Forget this version,"and get the original Broadway cast recording!!! Adam Pascal is a huge talent and he has one of today's strongest, most versatile voices. His CD Model Prisoner is also a must have."
2,Elton John Lost his Harmony in the Empty Sky,"It is evident that Elton's creative streak has come to a halt with the destruction of his vocal chords. Excess ingestion of seeds and substance caused the deterioration of the vocal chords, as well as track content. The other tracks are an upbeat compilation of 90's tunes. Digital technology sampling should be applied to bring Elton's younger vocal range back to his current works and leave Leann Rhymes out of the BIG PICTURE"
5,IT IS THE BEST DISNEY-BROADWAY ALBUM YET!!!,"First of all, if this program would go beyond 5 stars, I would still give the maximum. I think it's great for both KIDS AND ADULTS!!!! I thought the best writing and composing came to the songs ""The Messenger"" and ""Written In The Stars"" I have decided, when it comes to Broadway, and it goes on tour, I'm going to buy tickets the first day they open up. THIS CD IS THE BEST!!!"
5,Some of the best of other people doing Elton's music!,"Elton did a great job with the songs...I was also able to obtain the Demo CD from England that was all Elton and once I heard that, and could understand the words (from Elton), then going back to the other CD, I could better appreciate the other artist's interpretations. Elton, we're ready for more!"
5,He does it again!,"Nice Cd, but I don't like these versions after I heard Elton's demos... He just keeps doing the best music in the world! He's great! The Messenger is great song."
3,Aida,"This is not the soundtrack for the current Broadway show. The current one is much, much better. I would wait for it to come out. Many of the numbers are different and better."
2,Poor concept with few bright spots,"I bought this CD on the basis of Tina Turner's stunning performance of ""Easy as Life,"" which I sampled in the store. I should have sampled the entire CD before spending my money. Turner's song is perfectly delivered, and James Taylor does a lovely job with ""How I Know You."" ""Elaborate Lives"" is also quite excellent. The rest of the CD is pure drivel; it's hard to justify John and Rice's score or musical concept. Yes, ""Rent"" is a derivative of ""La Boheme,"" but it uses modern musical idioms and contemporary situations to bring something new to the story. Larson repeats with a difference, thus making something new of the material. John and Rice simply rehash old ground without adding anything new or interesting. And it was such good ground to start with, one wonders why they bothered. Buy Verdi, his version is the only AIDA worth spending your money on."
2,Wait for the Cast Recording,"I saw Aida on Broadway this weekend. I would definitely wait for the cast recording (due out June 6, I believe). I have listened to it about 15 times in the last two days...I cannot get enough of Adam Pascal (whose presence is not on the Concept album), what a voice! And the combination of Heather Headley, Sherie Rene Scott, and Adam are amazing. You won't regret waiting for the cast recording, believe me!"
5,EJ at his prime...,"Elton just keeps getting better - showing his multi-faceted talents keep growing. WHile Lion King was more ""pop"" ballads - AIDA is Elton truly exploring and delving into composing real thater music. At writing pop oriented theater music Elton easily exceed Andrew Loyd Webber - writing more complex and interesting songs and using the music to create the right atmosphere for the plot. The use of different artists has some interesting twists.EJ is not yet up to Sondheim in his theater writing abilities - but by gosh he is coming very close!"
5,Arthur and the invisibles,Great kids movie filled with adventure and humour for the whole family. I have ordered the other two as well!
5,arthur,good little movie. i purchased this for my son who is 28 years old for his bday. this movie is good for all ages.
3,The Pack Goat,"""The Pack Goat"" contains a wealth of arcane goat behaviour knowledge, and an interesting introduction to the art of goatpacking, by the father of goatpacking. It is not a how-to book, but does give you plenty of ideas on how to get started with your packgoat."
4,Love it,I bought it for 8 years old boy and start to play with it instantly. He love it and shared with his friend.
2,"Looks cool, but has problems!","I bought this player about 4 months ago and didn't even use it for running or much of anything outdoors when i had to send it in because it stopped working. I got it back from Sony, but they hadn't fixed anything! The second time I sent it back they fixed it but not 2 months later, the buttons quit working right! It is currently being repaired for the 3rd time in about as many months, which is ridiculous, considering I spent almost 200 bucks on it! I think Sony spent a little to much time making it look good, but not enough in quality. Nice things are the comfy headphones, the recharagable battery (although it doesn't last to long) and the AC adapter. I recommend spending less, because it apparently doesn't matter that much in terms of quality, which is what I thought I was getting!"
4,Great beginner's guide for starting a business!,"This book does a great job at exploring the various options for starting a legal business entity. The writing is straightfoward and interesting, and the organization of the book is spot on. The book serves as the perfect primer for business law, and will help readers identify what legal structure is best suited for their needs. Once this is done, I'd recommend finding a book (or lawyer) that focuses on that entity."
2,Not up to par,"I've been a fan of the Rich Dad / Poor Dad series, but to be frank, this was a disappointment. There is a good discussion of ""C"" corporations vs. LLCs, but other than those chapters, the rest of the book seemed like filler...I had higher hopes."
5,Very useful,"Incredible book gives you all the basics and more.For all those people that think you need to be an advanced businessman to read this book, I'm 21 and don't own any type of business.It's not an easy read, but if your dedicated, it gives you enough information to start your own corporation. My favorite parts of the book are the examples about the available laws, loopholes, tax breaks, etc.If anyone I know decides to start a business, I'm prepared to walk them through, or at least guide them in the right direction (that's how good this book is).Don't get me wrong, you might and most likely will need a lawyer, but at least you know which corporation to start with (depending on your business).If nothing else, this will show you the importance of a corporation and how not to mess up if you already have one."
5,Heard him speak/teach,"I recently went to a Rich Dad Seminar where half a dozen experts spoke, including, Mr. Sutton. His advice and thoughts were thoughtful, purposeful and sanguine. I particularly learned that for my own business purposes the structure which was necessary. The differences and uses of a S Corp, C Corp and so on (LLC, LLP) were explained and outlined to my ecstatic satisfaction. I recommend this book for anyone who is thinking about starting a business or who already has. What he will teach you is invaluable and the book itself is a tax deduction. It also contains a special deal to use his national firms resources. I think it would also behoove a businessperson to obtain all of the Rich Dad Series of books. For around a hundred dollars you can get a clear picture of what is necessary to think, know and feel for a business as well as what to do with money and where to find it."
4,Great place to start...,"This is really a very good book to start on if you don't know anything about the field and want to learn more. I think it may even be useful for people who have just started out with a business of some sort. There is a recurring theme of ""Make sure to ask your advisor about this"" and really the book could be condensed in to one phrase: ""GO FIND YOURSELF A REALLY GOOD LAWYER/ACCOUNTANT/FINANCIAL ADVISOR"" But the reason why I give it 4 stars is because if you don't know much about the field (like me), then it really gives you an idea of what issues your advisor should be talking to you about. If she's not, then you know you should either talk to her about it or find someone better really soon.A good read, it has examples that help explain the otherwise dry material in a very digestable manner."
5,A business-must read,"Rich Dad's-""Own your Own Corporation"" is a must read for anyone comtemplating a new business-or someone who already owns their own business. Garrett's direct yet simplistic explanations of the different business entities,the proper and best suited entity for your business-is followed by real-life scenarios which helps drive home the importance of corporate ownership in today's business world. Use Garrett's legal expertise to establish a successful, legally responsible and fiscally protected business...And understand the why's and how's of that ownership."
2,Not impressed!!!,"First, I must say that I have not read the entire book. My complaint about the book is the broad generalization it makes about the ""bad entities"" ('general partnerships' being one of them). The author tells you that a general partnership is a bad entity because you are personally liable for debt. Later on, as he describes corporations and LLCs, he mentions that small start-up are usually required by lenders to provide a personal guarantee that debt will be paid. Thus, even in those types of structures, the owner is still personally liable and their assets are at risk. He fails to mention that liability insurance can protect an business owner from some of the personal liability. It would have been nice if he could have provided more details in this area in order to distinguish between the two structures since the liabilty is the same. Maybe I just missed something."
1,Very Disappointing,"I purchased this book expected to get some insight on how the rich use company ownership to grow their wealth. Instead, this book is a rehash on how to start and set up your own company. The material can be found in any one of the hundreds of reference books already out there. Disappointing."
1,Definitely NOT for the layperson,"I learned nothing from the book. I was even more confused after I read it. There were no documents to show how to fill out any information. I don't recommend forming your own corporation by yourself. I wanted to take the easy way out, but realized I would've made a mistake. Instead, I took a seminar and I accomplished a lot more and got more than enough information to set one up. Of course, it costs a lot more to do so. However, it is the best alternative. Reading this book almost discouraged me from moving forward. I do recommend reading RICH DAD POOR DAD. It was an easy read,offered a great understanding of developing rich habits, but not very informative on real estate investing."
2,For the dreamers,This book makes everything sound very easy...I also wonder how he can have so much time writing book after book if he could just open up more corporations instead...Any book that's produced in a mass-series hardly contains solid information.
4,own your own corp.,"Perfect for the bigger businesses, but I'm not going to need this book for a few more years. Until then, it'll sit on my book shelf and wait for me to grow. I skimmed through it and it seemed very well put together."
5,a helpful imformative book,"Very helpful I was looking to incorp,but wasn't sure wich corp to choose. This book cleared it up"
3,Can we please get an honest review?,"It is so obvious that the glowing reviews for this book were bought and paid for! The structure and terminology make evident the quid pro quo involved. This book is fine. It gives the basic information that you can find in 100 other sources. It certainly wasn't so magnificent that I couldn't put it down and rushed to tell all my professional colleagues about it.It's a shame the great user review concept has been taken over by the reimbursed commentors, bloggers, etc."
4,Own Your Own Corporation,I found this book excellent for my purpose. It advises the reader about reorganizing their businesses for the necessary legal protection. It also advises on how to arrange finance or team up with friends for business
3,Start incorporating now!!!,If you have always dreamed of owning your own company and have been in the process of incorporating this book is the solution to get you moving in the right direction.
1,Should've been put in the fiction section,Appalling and apoplectic. This is just another book touting the fantasies of the Priory of Sion.Glad it was loaned to me.
3,Got lost in the Theoretical,"This book was a love/hate relationship with me! Approximately 75% was facinating. The remaining 25%, in my oppinion belonged in another book. Still there was alot of valuable information in this part also."
2,"merovingian mythos is just that, and LESS","Tracy Twyman is a Priory of Sion fanatic. When the book talks about the origins of European monarchy, it is informative and interesting. When she takes the reader to Atlantis, and discusses the Greek gods as if they were beings-in-fact, I feel as if I am reading a fantasy novel.Stick to geneologies, Tracy, and leave myth-making to the bicameral civilizations that first thought them up.As for the book, buy it only as the next-to-last item in your collection of Priory-Rennes-Magdalene-fish stories."
3,"A OK book, but just another ""guru"".","I bought this book after read some remarks in the Internet and magazines. Part I is the best one, where you get to know the basics and concepts about GTD. Part 2 is how the author does implement these basics and concepts in his day-by-day. Not for everyone. Part 3, just skip it. I wouldn't tell a friend to buy the book."
4,"A bit overhyped, but worth a shot","I'm not sure about the ""emptying the brain"" part of this greatly enhancing productivity (maybe because I haven't gotten to that stage yet), but some of the organizational tips do seem much more practical than the ""heavyweight"" approaches from Franklin-Covey and such. A light read from which you can probably extract a few good time management tips."
4,Helpful,"Really helped me organize my workplace. I would recommend this book as an ideal organization companion. The methods presented in this book can certainly help someone in the business of ""knowledge work"" get organized."
1,TODO: 1. Learn how to write,"Who is this guy? Did he attend high school? He certainly didn't pay attention to his English writing class. I've never seen such dreadful writing in a published book. As for the content, it's very dull and repetitive. This book could have been condensed into a 3-4 page pamphlet."
2,"Over 260 pages of blah, blah, blah.","This is the most boring book I've read in a few decades. I hope Allen is a better coach than a writer. There are some good points here but it could easily have fitted in 30 to 50 pages. ""Getting Things Done"" is an ironic read indeed for you feel you're getting nothing done."
3,It is always good to do things on time,"I really like the book, it focus on getting things done on time so you don't have to stress about it later. It is very true. Most people don't get things done on time as a result, they end up getting stress out. Make sure you get things done on time."
2,How to get things done,I'd much rather have it as a video. Those of us who have trouble getting everything done on a timely basis DON'T have time to sit and read a self-help book this verbose.
5,A book that delivers!,"I have worked with David Allen, and I have attended his seminar. I assumed that reading the book might be difficult because I might know too much about the content. Not so - the book reinforced what I knew of his principles. However, it also delivered many new insights.Even if you only take away one of David's philosophies from the book, the ""next action"" decision, it will justify reading the entire book.I highly recommend the book for anyone who wants to improve their productivity."
5,David Allen killed it!,"I used to find myself overplanning, only to have things change and finding myself re-planning out everything (which was very time consuming). David Allen's system is great for flexibility, and it really gives you peace of mind. I didn't follow the whole system, but I follow most of it and as a college student it has significantly freed up time.I would recommend reading through Getting Things Done, then listening to 5by5's ""Back to Work"" podcast, which supplements the book very well (only a few episodes are on GTD, check late-90s). Additionally, I would recommend getting OmniFocus as a more modern-day alternative to some of David Allen's approaches (as this book is pretty outdated technology-wise)."
5,This is a must read!,I've been using GTD (Getting Things Done) for many years now. I've given this book as a gift and read it occasionally myself to remind myself of the principles. I've seen some reviews that talk about a dearth of content. I could not disagree more. People learn differently and some will get the point quickly while others need more repetition and/or clarification.This is probably the most important methodology change I've made in my work and personal life. You can do this on paper with no technology investment. Pair it with tools like Evernote or Outlook and it's dynamite. (I love Evernote!).
5,Thumbs Up From Me,I've had a hard copy for several years and bought a Kindle version recently. Great book and methodology - if you are willing to develop the habits needed to make it work. It's worth the effort.
5,Great life changing process,"David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"" fits into the category of life changing. Practically written, this book contains ta treasure trove of valuable insights into the area of life management!"
4,Good one but feel something missing,"Let me say the honest thing, I am not someone who can able to change dramatically just by one book. I am a person who can able to plan the work and identify the priorities very well but often miss when its time to do the thing actually. That was my primary motive to read this book.It helps me a lot in planning the work and also I become more productive at many areas. It divides the task in five distinct categories. Starting from identifying the task to completion. Each category explain very well. But I think personally that its not always possible to put all the items in in-box (as author termed) and it is quite time consuming. May be its more useful at the higher level of corporate world but at lower end its not possible to go in so much detail of each task.I am sure if one follow the steps exactly mentioned by the author, than surely he/she can increase productivity to a great extent but the only open question is....are you able to do that?"
5,This System Will Revolutionize Your Life -- Personal + Work,"Wow!!! I just heard David Allen lecture at a conference I attended. Amazing stuff! If you want to truly reduce your stress by having a practical way to ""organize"" your life and work there is no better way to do it than David's system. It is unique--I've never heard anything like it before. As a result I'm going to buy this book and recommend it to everyone. This is a MUST read!"
3,"Read the full version first, use abridged audio for review","While the abridged audio CD version of Getting Things Done makes a perfect refresher tool for those who read the full book originally, too much detail and background is missing for this to be someone's first introduction to the GTD method of time management. Unfortunately, the unabridged audio won't be widely available until 2008.Overall, the GTD system has a lot to offer. It's ""open source"" and ""platform-independent,"" meaning you can use as much or as little of it as you want and adapt it to whatever organizational system you already like or are forced to use by circumstance--Outlook, FranklinCovey, 3x5s, whatever. Yes, it pretty much comes down to making a to-do list, but GTD's approach adds the subtle differences that make the lists actually effective reminders and trackers, rather than an overwhelming mess o' stuff to get done. If you've ever written something down on a list and then never looked at it again, give GTD a try."
4,"Empowerment Expert, Success Coach",If you don't have this book consider buying it. I suggest it for my coaching clients that have more to do than time to do it. ( Sound familiar?) The technique of writing down what you intend to do is a sound one. David has coached some of the top executives in the nation. I have known David for many years and had the pleasure to see that he walks his talk. This book works. Buy it.
5,Read Allen's book first...,"This book has changed my life. I will not go over what other readers have commented on, but would like to make a suggestion. If your GTD system is already set up, yet you cannot get into the flow, please read ""Isn't It About Time?"" by Andrea Perry. While Allen's book provides excellent structure to time management, Perry's book provides excellent insights into what might be delaying implementation. The book was written by a British author in a charming way, and not readly available, but well worth reading."
4,a system worth considering,Not quite finished with the book yet but appreciate the over-all system and am working to implement it. It's a good read for anyone interested in taking a look at his or her personal system of organization (or lack thereof) and at least making a few improvements or even whole-hearted change.
5,"Good Product, detailed but interesting",This book is more detailed than others I've read but is still a quick reader and is definately worth reading. It is very helpful and is interesting to read considering the topic. I would recommend this book.
3,Lots of details,I think this book has too many details that might get heavy for some people. But overall a good book for those who are patient.
4,The system works,"I'm naturally apprehensive about anything with such a cult-like following, but Getting Things Done is a system that really works. This is not the most clearly written book. Though the concepts are simple enough, the book is a bit of a slog at points.Some readers may be put off by the strict methodology presented in the book. Especially off putting was the instruction to set aside two days to get the system up and running. I found a more gradual two-week approach worked fine for me.Overall Allen's system has worked well for me."
5,It changed my life,"David Allen is considered to be one the top five Management consultants in North America according to a Forbes article. I now understand why.The basic concepts in his book are simple enough and are represented by a flow chart, but there are so many other golden nuggets of ""best practice"" information within this book that you have to study it to get them all. I've read the book and listened to his second (audio) book ""Ready for anything"" four times in a row just to reinforce the great points within this book.The result of implimenting his structure of workflow has suprisingly allowed me to act with more freedom and creativity in my job and a reduction in stress. I can even find stuff easily since setting up my folders and buying a label making machine (his recommendation).He's really on to something big with his ""next action"" thinking approach (chapter 11) and his two-minute rule.One of the best books I've read in the last three years."
5,"Easy to follow, easy to stick with.","David's flowchart is easy to follow and easy to stick with. Since I read this book 5 months ago, I am still using the techniques recommended by this book. My email ""in-box"" has gone from regularly holding over 200 messages to now filling up less than 1 screen in Lotus Notes."
4,Great Advices - Super value for Money,"I really looked for a book that will guide me how to keep my stress low.In this book I found both the problem that causes most of us high stress, and it's resolution.Highly recommended"
4,The New Secular Spirituality,"This book actually has all the answers to all the problems in your life. You just have to follow it. I did it for a week my career hit a new trajectory I was able to manage a very complicated project and bring on board 4 more senior staff to work FOR me. My personal life hit a new levels I called people when I had to, paid bills on time, cleaned my house.And then I got lazy again and started to leave papers around the house. Not answer emails within 2 minutes. And it all feel apart and I'm back to normal now. But if you have discipline go for it!And 4 stars cos it is out of date now. There are so many efficiency enhancing tools available now."
3,Not for the ADD,"If you have trouble focusing or following things in a linear path, I don't recommend this book. I'm OCD and very much Type A in personality and I struggled through this book. This whole system was very confusing and maybe in a year or two I'll be able to focus on it a bit better. But I'm also impatient. Give me solutions that I can apply now so I can start to see results. This book is not built that way. I recommend this book instead:Zen To Done: The Ultimate Simple Productivity System"
5,"Convincing, effective, and complete!",This is an awesome book! I wish I'd implemented these practices earlier -- instead of so many failed attempts at priority management.
4,worth the money,This book had some good ideas for keeping up with the things you have to keep up with. Easy to implement and maintain.
3,Good organizational concepts,"Getting Things Done is hot right now and with good reason. We all have too much on our minds and on our plates. This book will help you cut through the clutter. (If you want to get a taste of the author's way of thinking, check out his website. Just do a Google search for ""David Allen"". The flowchart that is the core of his system is provided there.)"
2,Not what I was looking for,"The concepts in this book are excellent for people with little or no organization in their life. I've always made efforts to stay on top of everything I had to do, and was hoping this book would teach me something new to put squeeze a bit more productivity and efficiency into my daily grind.Unfortunately, nothing in this book should be new to anyone who has put the slightest bit of effort into attempting to improve their productivity.Then, to make matters worse, the book rambles and repeats (and rambles and repeats, and...). Additionally, although I'm usually a pretty quick reader, but the inordinate amount of sidebar notes in this book slowed my reading, are extremely distracting, and provide zero added benefit.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the material would be beneficial for some people despite the poor presentation."
5,"very good book, indeed","This is a very detailed, serious and logical system to get things done. You may or may not buy the whole system (lists and lists), but implementing some of his advice brings quick results. The alphabetical filing worked very well for me. Dating documents and information was also very valuable. This is simple but it works. I bought it at a time when I took a new job, and it helped me to be more organized and to process the backlog of work. What I discovered is that you still need to find your own organizing style. This guide is quite specific in its advice but you do not have to use the whole system. Just use the ""organizing"" blocks that suit your style. In the end, I am less frustrated with my organizing skills than before and I am going to re-read the book to improve my skills further."
1,Don't buy the audio version,If you think the printed version is bad just wait until you have to listen to the audio version. Total bore fest and too much info for an audio. The ideas mentioned are super basic. I'm wondering if the 5 star reviews read a different book.
4,Getting Things Done - needs some organizing,I think this is a must read book for leaders. I wish he would have organized the structure of the book a little more. I felt when I was reading as I was covering more tracks than necessary going backward and forward in the text to understand the context of the material he was explaining.Content of the book was incredible though.
5,David Allen Wrote THE BOOK on Productivity,"Getting Things Done is more than just another productivity book. GTD (as it's sometimes abbreviated) is a methodology that helps you organize your countless projects, tasks, errands, lists, and even your ideas so you can be free to think about what's really important... what you're working on right now.I first read GTD several years ago, and have since been using the system both at work and in my everyday projects and tasks. Some people think using a system like this is too rigid, and limits you from being able to be spontaneous or make decisions. It's not true at all... if anything GTD actually frees you up to be more flexible because it eliminates all those little things that fall through the cracks and then become big emergencies.I believe in GTD so much, I regularly buy copies to give to clients and colleagues (which is what I just did recently). It just works."
5,Great ideas!,"I wish I had read this book years ago. Sure, it's not for everyone and isn't laid out as well as it could be (no reason to slam it though, like some reviews do), but I've taken it to heart and IMO it has helped me immensely. I'm even modifying the application I use in Lotus Notes to incorporate the GTD philosophies. I wish there were better reviews, and I can't stand all the little distracting margin notes, but I read it, then skimmed it, then started working with his ideas and I feel a dramatic improvement in the control I have over all my oustanding ""stuff."" Definitely a worthy read."
2,10x longer than it should be,"It seems a lot of people have benefited from this book, but for me, I didn't find the book very appealing. I'm still trying to make sense of the program, though I admit I did skim the last 100 pages. It was much, MUCH longer than it needed to be, imo, and it was scattered and fragmented in so many different sections and topics, my head was spinning. The core program could have been described in a few pages, but then again, that wouldn't be a very marketable book."
2,Too abstract and too long,"Since I'm into organizing things and also maintain an online organizer (bookmark-manager.com) I thought I give this book a shot. Unfortunately I found this book too abstract and long. Many of the tips seem to be just common sense like David Allen admitted himself at the end of the book. The quotes left and right all the time are more distracting than helpful. One at the beginning of each chapter might have been enough. Enough though this review could be viewed as negative I admit that I haven't read it completely and English is not my first language, which might partly the reason the book wasn't useful for me."
3,Organize your Email,"Read pgs 1-54. Loved the information regarding email organization. I finally have a system in place that helps me tackle things in a logical order. I had my email folders arranged by subject category but realized I needed to arrange them by immediacy so I now have a ""Do Now,"" ""Do Later,"" ""Delegate"" and ""Maybe/Someday"" folders."
5,A Must Have,"As a consultant to small business, I am always looking for tools that will help folks with their productivity. This book is a gem. Rather than providing a ""locked in system"" that requires you to organize in one particular way - using one particular set of tools; this book is much more than that. It reveals the larger scope of underlying process and then gives the reader ideas about how to resolve gaps without being too prescriptive and narrow about the actual system one might employ. This is a very accessible book. Even doing a quick glance and picking up a few key ideas (such as the 2 minute rule) will immediately pay off in terms of taking back control of what often seems to be an endless stream of To Dos that there never seems to be enough time to manage. 5 Stars !!!"
4,GTD as advertised,My view of these type of books is simple: if you pick up one helpful hint or habit it is worth it. This is worth it. If nothing else use the way to handle the avalanche of email I/you get is worth the cost of the book. Buy it kiddies....
1,Not a book of unique ideas for organization as promised,"The book is a series of warmed-over ideas from a multitude of sources. I saw nothing unique in the 100 or so pages I read about organizing my life, particularly since it was directed at corporate. I didn't even get the book done. It's on the shelf."
1,Why should this book cost the same for KINDLE as for the physical media?,Explain to me why I should pay the same amount for a digital edition of a book that doesn't need to be warehoused printed or shipped as I do for the physical book which requires all of the same???Sorry Amazon...no kindle for me (and I'll tell all of my friends why) until you stop with the greed.
1,More Useless Drivel,"I am appalled that this book is getting so much attention. My company even distributes the book to every employee (bumping out the equally unimpressive ""Seven Habits"").I couldn't even sit through the whole book at once; I had to drag myself almost paragraph by paragraph just to finish it. A combination of corporate drivel and mindless observation, the ""tips"" he offers are useless at best, and counterproductive at worst.It is amazing that so many people are screwing their lives up so badly that this book is actually helpful to them.If you want a truly helpful self-help program, try Dale Carnegie."
2,Nothing New Here,"This book really doesn't tell you anything new, nothing that you didn't already know, unless you've never worked in an office before. There is lots of repetition, and the author has a penchant for stating the obvious and making it seem as if he is giving you some great secret or principle. He never gets down to the nitty-gritty; he never gives you a step-by-step procedure for processing your documents quickly and getting the data entered into the computer quickly and then getting the papers into the files quickly. That's what we want to know, not some abstract flow chart. He never shows exactly how to multitask with constant interruptions. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Not very original,"Most of his ideas in his system are modified version of other authors. Nothing really original about this book. It's almost a survey class in time management. A lot of it was taken from Robert Covey's First things First. All he did was change the wording but the idea is still Robert Covey's. And there is an excessive amount of motivational fluff. Anyone whose read Tony Robbins know that motivational fluff only works till you put the book down. Read Seven habits of highly effective people, first things first, and unleashing the warrior within."
2,Spends too much time discussing what people do,"This book is full of filler content instead of actual useful content. It spends a lot of time talking about how people usually handle a situation or how someone normally plans out a project. I would rather the book spend more time talking about the right way to plan a project and give examples, or include more examples on how to organize a list of things.I could also do without the first chapter which just discusses why the author wrote the book. I'd rather the author just get down to the facts, I don't have time to read through all the frivolous content, I want just the facts when I read a book like this."
3,Interesting not amazing,"There are a lot of ideas compacted into this small book. I think there are a lot of useable suggestions. You might not be able to apply all the concepts in this book but it will get you thinking about how to organize yourself, get things done..."
2,Getting Things Done,"The book puts forth some decent ideas for getting a handle on your to do list - but is way too granular. For example, at one point the author gets into a discussion of whether you are better off using hanging folders or not. It appears to me that much of the content was developed to justify being published as a book."
5,Really nice book,help me a lot and I start to be organizedrecommend young people read this excellent bookgood luck with it
4,Not just for the businessman...,"I feel weird raving about a business book. In fact, the business-ese (e.g. ""deliverables"") and business context of most of the examples deters me from giving it five stars.That said, I think David Allen completely nailed the psychology of how I deal with ""stuff"" in my life. While I probably will use his principles/processes/systems (See what I mean about ""business-ese""?), I'm really looking forward to how I imagine it will help me deal with all the literal and metaphorical clutter in my life. I've starting implementing it and do feel the greater ease of being less preoccupied by all the things I feel are ""un-done.""Check back in with me in six months. That's when it'll be really clear whether the book is one to rave about..."
4,Very very helpful,"Very helpful book and it forces you into thinking about your priorities for projects. It describes an excellent way to clearly organize tasks and projects into different ""buckets"". The philosophy behind it, the idea of storing as much information about a task in one place and making it easy to reference anything related to that task is a simple idea but it is hardly done!My only complaint is that the later parts, about the larger view of things, is weak. It's a great help for organizing the next day, week or month, but after that, you'll need to look outside the box."
4,Good information,"I just purchased this book from the air port during a flight. It was interesting information, some of it is just stating obvious information, but kept my attention. Buy it if you have nothing else."
4,Better performance using GTD,"GTD is helping me to organize the way I work and live. Now, I can get a feeling of a better control over the projects I execute in my life (professionally and socially). This will help you build a new mental model of doing things! One observation: the organization of the book could have been done better."
5,Best I've read,"I really can't add that much to what has been said already. THIS SYSTEM WORKS AND IT WORKS WELL. I have used several ""organizing systems"" in the past and they simply didn't work or were too hard to keep track of. This system worked right into my personal way of keeping track of all I do. I use this with Microsoft Outlook.Update: I'm still using this system more than ever even after two years or so. While minor changes have occured, the system is still pretty much the same."
3,Good Advice,The first chapter tells you what the book is all about. Basically have a single place to enter all of your notes. Then you can filter those out and work on what is really important. Nothing earth shattering.
2,Not helpful if you are a homemaker or work from home...,"This book might live up to the hype for what it can do for managers of teams, busy executives and supervisors but if you work at home, particularly by yourself, there is not much here. There is a helpful chart early on in the book which can help one decide how to handle paper and the suggestions for setting up filing system are universal but I was not looking for tips on productive brainstorming sessions with a group of people. Many times he mentions homemakers and soccer schedules but application of his methods is lacking."
5,This book changed my life!,"If you are a CEO of a Fortune 500 Company or, like me, the CEO of a tiny 1-year-old business and a household, you can benefit from David Allen's strategy.He reffers to it as ""Advanced Common Sense"". It's tricks and tools that you already are doing, but better.I felt, literally, like I was going to die from stress. I couldn't sleep for months and months. I was constantly being reminded of things I needed to do the next morning or the next week, or before I die, at 1 o'clock in the morning.Now everything I ever need to do is in one place. I am human again."
2,Tedious,"I bought this book looking for one or two good ideas that I could apply to make myself more productive. I did find a simple idea in the book that is usefull, but the other three hours I spent reading it were very tedious.Perhaps if you aren't very organized it will help you more, but if you are fairly productive already a better book to read would be The Biology of Success by Bob Arnot. It has a chapter on organizing your office that I got more usefull ideas out of than this entire book."
2,Frustrated,"The Amazon.com review said it well: convoluted, lots of fancy terms, subterms and sub-subterms for the simplest concepts. I find myself spending a lot of time figuring out what he's trying to say. The first three chapters are all theory, added perhaps to make the book respectably sized... much time is spent ""telling us what he's going to tell us."" I also find it difficult to take a couple of days (or more)to collect all the ""to-do"" actions in my life; a lot of bosses may have a problem with that, too.I'm still working with it, though, trying to see if I can get to the system that all these people are raving about."
3,layout and print needs work,"I was really looking forward to getting this book before I set up my home-based business. I was told it was great for time-management stragglers like myself. I found it not easy to navigate through, if you want to get to the pointers right away. Lots of too-obvious preaching which is a time waster in itself. Point form, do this and don't do that sort of advice would have been more my style. There is good info in there--so I've been told--but right now its on my shelf for a time when I have the time...."
1,Not a well written book,I did not find this book very useful. The same information is repeated over and over which makes it boring. I personally did not like the writing style of the author. Not an easy book to read. Reading the book only increased my stress.
2,why do I keep falling for these things?,"It's true, I haven't finished this book yet, but already I feel duped by the delusion that reading a book will solve my procrastination issue. This just feels like another diversion from really doing things.So far it feels very redundant and obvious."
3,Very Outdated,"This book is pretty outdated. Lots of talk about post-it notes & Palm PDAs (I suppose you could think of that as today's iPhone). This book teaches a paper & file-folder system of getting organized. It does not teach us how to utilize today's digital technology to organize our information and our schedules. It can still work, but I feel like with today's technology, there are WAY better ways of ""getting things done"". There are a few suggestions that I will use, but overall, I was a little disappointed in this book. Review written - March 2012"
4,Getting Organized,"Keeping emails, to-do's, files ... organized and handling them in a timely manner is important to me. I have utilized a collection of techniques that have served me well over the years. David Allen offers tried and proven methods that have improved my ability to ""get it done."""
4,Great practical advice - complicated presentation,"I found the essential and very useful message in just a few pages of this book. It may be that the author felt the need to appeal to both engineers and poets or a need to simply bulk up the message, but I think it could have been done with many fewer words and less complexity.If you find that this book is helpful to your daily routine, I recommend ""The Hamster Revolution: Managing Your Email Before It Manages You"" as a complimentary practical guide to putting these concepts to work on your computer.The Hamster Revolution: How to Manage Your Email Before It Manages You (Bk Business)"
4,"This system works, if you adapt it to meet your needs","David Allen's system really helps get things off your mind. Your brain doesn't obsess over all the things you have to do because those things are captured in a trustworthy system. The whole goal, as Allen says, is to have a ""mind like water""--a clear mind capable of having great ideas and doing great work.This system is easy to personalize and to adapt for the organizational tools you like to use. To get it to work for you, I recommend that you make it your own, instead of trying to implement it exactly as Allen does."
4,Good advice with high-level reasoning and detailed tips,"I really enjoyed the way this book covered the topic from both the high-level explaining issues with both ""winging it"" and several other systems, and also the detail-level with enough information not just to implement his methodology, but to tailor it to fit you well as an individual.Implementing this is not easy, and one doesn't have to go all the way to get value from the book, but the biggest payoff comes from a complete implementation. I would have appreciated a more technical solution (probably would require dedicated software). In this age of iPhones and internet everywhere, storing all lists and files electronically for easy access and portability would make sense to me."
3,"Some good ideas, but far too verbose","After reading all the comments and positive reviews, I was looking forward to this book as a tool to help me better process the information that comes across my desk. While I did get some good ideas, this text is far too long for the content, which could (and should) be summarized in about 20 pages. As it is, this information is interspersed among nearly 260 pages of text, much of which pertains to the philosophy of the author's approach. Personally, the benefit gained from the ideas presented did not justify the time it took to read."
4,STAY Organized,"Most of what is in this book is easily implemented. I put the basics learned to use and it certainly helped me keep track of the mundane AND important daily, weekly, yearly tasks. The file organization was a wonderful help. Even though the book may be a bit wordy (probably publisher requested) this book is one of the best I've seen on the subject and his plan is easy to keep up with."
2,Dated,"If you want a modern version of this text, check out anything that Lifehacker has written. This book is very dated."
4,I thought it was my OCD!,"Heard about this book listening to Howard Stern so I ordered a copy. As suspected it reinforced methods I have developed for myself over the last 40 years that use to seem like just a case of OCD. Also, interesting is how the martial arts aspect fits into this equation."
4,"A bit lengthy, but well structured and simple to apply","This is the bible when it comes to organizing yourself.After reading this book, I find myself with a clean desk, a pieceful mind and in control of the things that really matter. The nice thing about the method is that it does not rely on high-tech software and gadgets, though they can help. Good writing gear and a pile of paper, and a few plain manila folders is all you need to get started. You can tailor it to your own setting and to the tools you like (e.g., I like emacs and org-mode).The book is a bit lengthy, but well structured, so that you get the gist of the presented methodology after a few tens of pages. The rest is elaboration of all aspects of the method. It reads without effort.I tend to reread sections in the book from time to time, just to check if there still is room for improvement in my organization."
2,Leverage the paradigm to create opportunities of buzzwords,"This book creates a comfortable zone of sophistication with an abundant and abounding proliferation of buzzwords and jargon, designed to facilitate the reader's engagement with the material.Stripped of the jargon, the book says ""figure out what stuff you want to solve, make lists of how to solve them, prioritize those lists, and write things down to free up your brain space."" There is the entire work, deprived of jargon and endorsements, in 28 words.For some crazy reason, the Kindle version costs more than the paperback. For sake of not empowering such modalities of information transference pricing strategies, I procured a cover-deprived volume at a purveyor of previously owned printed works."
4,Stress free is right!,"I'm a person who needs a little help in the organizing department. David Allen's approach seems to be what I need to get my life in order.Sometimes you can read these self-help books, but if you don't feel like you can apply it to your situation, it can't really help. I am still in the process of reading the book, but I feel I am being helped by it tremendously, and I'm getting a handle on Getting Things Done."
4,getting things done,"Environmental Cleanup Coalition and The Gyre Cleanup Project would like to thank David for his amazing insight and concise way of expressing in print. This will dove tail nicely into our philosophy of getting the oceans cleaned up and restored back to optimal health. [...]Our deepest gratitude,Aloha Richard Sundance Owen"
5,simple.but.powerful.concept,he explains simple to implement concepts. gets your mind going and gives you a realistic perspective how to stay on top of what needs to get done first to achive your objectives. i'm glad i bought this book
1,Does Anyone Have The Time To Do This System?,"Anyone who has the time to do Allen's system does not have a time management problem. This approach would be attractive to productivity experts, but is simply unworkable to the average over-worked Sally or Joe. It takes three hours a week just to feed this system and keep it going! I laid awake at night trying to figure out if an e-mail goes in @computer or @work? I could never find anything after I followed his system. Maybe it's me, but I believe there is better time management advice out there."
1,waiste of time,"If I wanted to know what a file folder or a paperclip was for this would be a very useful book. Defining them in length was a way to add words to this book. Having people go out and spend money on file folders and unnecessary billboards when we live in an age of technology seems silly.The whole concept of being a vertical thinker is limiting. It is a narrow minded approach to allow lemmings to feel good about what they are doing. It places too much emphasis on thinking in one direction rather that stopping evaluating and seeing the entire picture of a situation.The only thing that was useful were three lines. Do it,Delegate it, or dump it. And this is only if you want to cast off things that could very well prove useful elsewhere. Sure simplifying to the extreme reduces a persons stress, because they will never take on anything that could actually make them grow as a person.As a history book for how things were done in the past. Go for it."
2,"Antique Road Show, here we come.","Just as an accountant now days would not use an Abacus,one should not rely on this material to aid in organizing your activities.This is very outdated. Unless you are still using Post-It pads to keep track of your day this has no use."
1,save your time and money: don't buy this book,A waste and an insult. The author spends thousands of words stating the obvious: that people are maxed out.This laborious introduction is a complete insult to busy readers who don't have the time to slog through lots of excess verbiage.Note to Mr. Allen:GET TO THE POINT!LEARN HOW TO WRITE!STOP WASTING OUR TIME!I wouldn't pay this guy a nickel to consult at my company.He obviously has no respect for people's time.This book is a farce
4,Great Book Great Condition,"This is a great book, it truly helped me become more productive. The read was a little slow at first, but I found I could implement certain tips and come back and read more later."
4,Great Detailed Plan,"Very interesting set of ideas. The most useful analogy is to your computer RAM, the active front burner memory whose unoccupied space dictates how well and fast you are able to process and manipulate information. The author contends that a clean RAM is best for being able to do your best work. How do you get a clean RAM? You must have a system to catalogue all of the ""stuff"" that comes at you like drinking from a firehose. The author goes to great detail describing a complex method that creates a system to capture and catalogue everything you can think of or even image. I think the basic premise ""ie a clean RAM"" is a very useful idea that until you work with it you do not appreciate the power contained in this simple concept. The book does make you a bit dizzy at times by the details of the ""system"" but is well worth the effort to put the ideas into use."
5,Bye-Bye Procrastination,"Forget about old systems that don't work. This is the best approach to productivity I've found. It's totally worth learning this method and fine-tuning it to your life and needs. Plus there is tons of blogging about it, and apps based on it. Community support as well as official support is plenty. 100% recommended."
3,Great Theory. Missing on implementation,"This book will lay out a great theory on getting things done, but David keeps on suggesting using.a paper system which of no one can really use..Sorely missing implementation on how to implement this theory with some practical digital tools.I would still buy this book, as it can convince you to get the house in order. But you should know that you will have to buy some other book to actually get use out of it."
3,Overly Structured Way of Management,"I was very excited to get this book and start becoming more productive.Although I do agree with his explinations for why we are so unproductive and how things will weigh on us and cause us not to act, I was not impressed with his methods for managing these issues. It seems that the end result of following this method is you have a very well organized collection of items to do - but you spend a majority of the time writing things down and not actually doing them.I gave the method a chance for a few months and was very gung ho at the beginning but quickly realized I wasn't getting more things done, I was just recording everything I wasn't getting done. I would rather spend more time doing and less time planning (at least not overplanning).Two books that I think provide a more practical approach areZen To DoneandDo It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management. I would give them a try if this doesn't seem like it's for you."
4,Great tool for productivity,"This is a good book that helps with what it says... getting things done. It's not one of those ""create your life plan"" books. It's just great at managing the chaos."
5,Boost your productivity with Getting Things Done,"Getting Things Done is an awesome book that takes productivity to another level.The author details throughout the book a structured process advising you on how to manage your time and work in an effective and efficient manner. You will be guided on how to capture and process your open loops, TODOs, project tasks you are working etc.Getting Things Done it's a recommended book for anyone who wants to boost his/her productivity."
5,Really Liked this book.,"I found this very helpful and specific, offering an excellent way to get organized and relieve stress. Lot's of concise explanations. Important addition to anyone's library who doesn't already have a great working system."
3,Good reading,Good gift for hubby. Bought after hearing about it on radio show. Decent price..worth the cash. Good tips and advice.
5,Great advice,This book is great! It's helped me to get organized and I continue to gain new insights from it. Highly recommend!!
1,I couldn't get this book read...,"I couldn't bring myself to finish this book. I figured as useless as the information I found contained in this book, perhaps I'd better invest my time in otherwise getting (other) things done...The one good morsel I did take away is if a task takes 2 minutes or less, do it immediately. A FAR better book is ""Million Dollar Habits."""
3,Kindle edition costs more than paperback?,"I haven't read the book yet, but how could the Kindle digital edition cost SIGNIFICANTLY more than the paperback? What a ripoff. The publisher and author should be embarrassed. Enough said."
2,"Some Time Saved, Some Wasted","Allen's core ideas are excellent but need to be laid out more concisely; his expansion on them only confused me, and more orderly; the 43 folders idea should have been introduced earlier in the book. I found myself irritated that he should have been saving me time but he was wasting it with endless alternate methods."
1,Who writes these 5 star reviews??,The author is likeable and the book is an easy read. It confirmed what I already knew - get all of your to do's consolidated into one list so you can prioritize. Beyond that it didn't really add much value to my life or work.
5,it's ok,this book puts it all the table. very interesting and educational about the new we and how to deal with it.
2,dissappointed,I am halfway through the set of CDs and it has been nothing but the basics in terms of organization. Nothing specific about reducing stress with staff to-dos or advanced thinking at all. So far it is about having an inbasket and priortizing etc. Dissapointing. Hopefully the last CD will be golden but if it is I will still be dissapointed in the waste of my time.
4,Pretty interesting,It's designed for upper management officers but it has bits and pieces for everyone of us. Maybe some things are a bit controversial but at the average very good. I've started to use these techniques but cant yet say how good they are. Sure it relies stress from your mind.
2,Had to read for work...,"If you happen to already be a Type A obsessive ""achiever""you might like this book. I have rarely read a bookthat used the words ""must"" ""have to"" ""need to"" anda myriad of other judgmental comments if you don'thappen to be the person he is describing."
5,Purposeful Obssesive Cumplusion,"He absolutely nailed it. David Allen's system for organizing...your brain really...appears to be perfect. Getting Things Done provides the methods and the reasons for each step of personal and professional organization. Once organized, it teaches you how to stay that way.This review was written in under two minutes....you'll understand that after you read the book (and you should)."
3,"Sound principles, annoying audio, just okay","The audio book version of Getting Things Done has an incredibly dry, military monotone that drove me nuts. The principles addressed are sound, but listening to someone who sounds like an uptight drill sargent is not.The principles of the material are great, but if you are not taking notes to the audio, you will get lost. A book is a better option while you set up your system. It's easier to refer to.A book I found more helpful and interesting is ""Conquering Chronic Disorganization"" by Judith Kolberg, which stresses a flexible system based on being primarily visual, audio or kinesthetic-oriented. I found that in the end to be more helpful than this system."
5,"He's right, this is a new practice for a new reality.","Wow! The power of next action decision making and David Allen's extraordinary next action techniques makes this book a true winner.The simple power of his key principles about how to get things done really make sense to me. I loved chapter 9 about Making the Best Action Choices.Do yourself a favor, treat yourself to this one. You will thank yourself and when you give this to anyone else they will thank you."
2,kindle edition,Simply ported to kindle without including hyperlinks when referring to page numbers and figures. Amazon should have a tighter quality control wrt these issues.
1,Pretty useless,One of the worst I've ever been through in the self-help genre. Most of the book is spent detailing a fantastically complex filing system. Remarkably lacking in helpful advice. Allen spends a lot of time bragging about the executive clients he has worked with. I can only say I pity anyone so unfortunate as to attempt to improve his life by meeting with Allen. Don't waste your money on this turkey.
5,"""Getting Things Done""","As far as I'm concerned, the author hit a home run with this book. I could easily relate to what he was saying. It fit my situation and helped me get things done where other techniques such as time management did not."
5,The Best Organization Tool,"I love this Book. I bought this book and Total Workday Control Using Microsoft Outlook and I am amazed at how much work I get done. This is the best thing I have done to improve my work flow at the office. Thanks to these two books, I have become so efficient, it's incredible!"
4,The OCD's best friend,"Being a nerd and more than little obsessive, I find leaving work at work when coming home a difficult challenge. With Allen's methodology I stand a chance when things are hectic and overwhelming at work. I've only been using it for a little while but already I feel less neurotic and more in control. It's simple and that's the beauty of it so give it a go. Even if it isn't for you, it will at least tell you a lot about the clutter that is your life."
3,A Shopping List?,"Based on the number of high reviews I've seen, I'm in the minority on this one. I felt like I was reading a shopping list to buy office supplies. Most of the things Mr. Allen speaks about should be self-explanatory. I got about half way through the book then found myself skimming chapters just to keep from going crazy or falling asleep.I have no doubts that Mr. Allen is a great motivational speaker and that he's a decent writer, but I think this book was about 150 pages too long.I give it 3 stars because I think there are a few bits and pieces that can be used to make some processes more efficient. However, the bottom line is that everyone will have to adhere these processes to what works for them."
3,There are gems in the book but you need to sort them out,"I read the CD version of the book and it certainly has several important and interesting ideas to make getting things done less stressful. Take them off your mind! He explain some of the reasons why we feel this way with open issues.The main drawback of the book is that you have to read 3 Cd's for the information that can be condensed in 1/3 of one. A few pages summary would also do. Maybe for people that are just starting to figure out how to deal with information would be Ok. The other drawback is that relies too much in file (paper) systems. It deals only superficially with electronic systems.The book does have some merits but I would have paid the same amount for a 1/2 CD with what the relevant information, how to and ideas. This would have saved me the time to try to figure out which were all the ideas and how to's that were useful."
2,"Many great ideas, loosely connected, inconsistently explained","I finally took the ""Next Action"" of studying (not scanning) this widely acclaimed book. The many ideas and systems described by Allen sound great but, in the end, do not generate a coherent system. Of the dozens I could cite, I give just two examples.1. On page 170 he admonishes the reader to not use a categorization of ""Hold and Review"". One paragraph later he says that anything that one would have put in ""Hold/Review"" should actually go in ""Read/Review""....with no substantive differentiation.2. The book is replete with instances where Allen creates a proper noun such as ""Someday/Maybe"" and then overlays it with another word ""Incubate""...which sounds an awful lot like ""Hold (incubate?) and Review"".While I did not attempt to do so, my overwhelming impression is that a systematic reconsideration of the system and a rewriting of the book in which every component fits in a coherent way with the next, could turn this into a useful system."
1,Too much common sense,"This whole book really could have been summarized in ten pages. The rest is just fluff, mindless personal commentary on how to organize stuff without any reason on why Allen's way is better than other ways he criticizes in the opening. Allen pats himself on the back constantly saying ""executives"" use his method and how he sets up conferences. It's a really really bad book and a waste of time. Great title though-- made me buy the book."
2,Written for business people,"I bought this book to, uh, get things done. LOL I read the reviews and thought it would help me organize my life and get more done in my day. Not so. David wrote this book specifically for business people. All the examples and recommendations are for business people. I'm a homemaker (domestic goddess) right now and none of his options translated well into my real life."
4,"Getting ""Getting Things Done"" done","If you're a fan of, (or recent convert to) this system of productivity then the set of 3 CDs makes reviewing very straightforward.Having the author, David Allen, read a streamlined version of his book highlights where he believes the emphasis should be placed.I tossed up if I should buy the CDs when I was also buying the book. Having purchased both I am very pleased with the decision.Ardeet"
2,Book is from when we still had rolodex!!,"This book is old. The book discusses use of rolodex cards, file folders, pda in almost 1/4 of the book. But it offered good advice on how to get things done."
3,Not sure What All the Hype is About,"I read how great this book is, and I'm really not sure what all the hype is about. It's OK, and does offer some interesting insights, but I've read many books over the years that offer better advice and instructions on getting your life organized."
5,Very cool system to free your mind and become creative...,"Such a simple concept yet a freeing exercise when done which allows you to lose that mental weight/baggage and become more creative and productive. Highly recommend for all, especially people with big task lists, or people who always have a lot of things to remember to do. :-) Make Today Great! Tom Beal"
4,"Amy Lynn still has ""It""",Its nice to see Amy Lynn Baxter still looking so good some 15 years after her days as a Penthouse Pet. Plot? What plot?
1,ultrasonic doesnt work,"the only thing that works is the alarm, the rest doesnt do anything to dogs the ultrasonic doesnt work at all"
2,chewy bark,I was excited to receive this as I have dogs on both yards next to my home. I didn't work very well. The dg shuts up for about three seconds and then the dogs continue to bark. Very frustrating
2,Bark Stop Portable does not live up to its name.,The device was missing one of the grips. It will sometimes not shut off and continue buzzing. I am not impressed.
5,Terific!I've Never seen New France this way!,"It was a great book.It's okay,but only once,but that is enough.I suggest you borrow this at the library.It's okay once,but then it's boring."
5,"My cousin calls it ""The brick""","I drop my Zune like it's on fire...a lot. The restarting screen it throws at me like it's mad was getting really irritating. It was like it was warning me about how one day like my four other mp3s it wasn't ever going to come on again. But with this I hardly ever see that screen and the way it's made, so that it's not going to just slip out your hands. Like it said all the buttons are accessible. If you have headphones that are shaped like an L where you plug them i at it may be a bit of a problem because the plastic may prevent them form being pushed in all the way."
2,Too loose,"The protetive skin fits too loose around the zune. I have a 120G zune and was disappointed because it doesn't wrap snuggly around it. I guess it's ok because hopefully it will do the job since it doesn't seem like it's going to come undone, but unfortunately, I don't like it that much. However, I'm glad to have it in order to help protect it somewhat."
4,Does what I need.,"Item wasn't exactly how it was pictured, but the description fit it. Case has been working just fine for me. Have it in my pocket all the time and hasn't shown any sign of wear or loss of elasticity. Good case."
4,Great product for price but not a necessity,"This silicone ""case"" is made of really thick durable rubber. The case fits snugly around the Zune. The port holes for the buttons and earphone jack are a little sunken because of the thick silicone. This isn't a problem as long as you can poke your nails through to the buttons which isn't to hard to do. The case doesn't have any screen protection but overall, the protection offered is nice. It also gives the Zune a better aesthetic with the textured padding sides and front. The case only seems to come in black. more colors would have been appreciated. The Case also comes with a arm band strap for runners. The elastic armband is surprisingly high quality and is easily attached to the case if desired.I personally bought this item to make my Zune 30 (1st gen) look and feel better. This product does the job fine."
4,Great Case,"The Case is very well made and has saved my Zune from a couple of near misses.The case gives you access to all the buttons and ports, the only thing is that the case is so thick that it sometimes makes it difficult to access certain buttons on the face and top of the zune.Other than that, the case is well worth it"
4,Fits well - good protection for Zune,"This simple silicone sleeve provides good protection for the 30GB Zune. It's nothing fancy, but it will keep the Zune's housing from getting scratched and beat up. The belt clip is pretty worthless, however - the mounting screw broke right away. Have not tried the armband, but it looks a little cheesy and it threads through a pair of slots in the silicone cover, so there's not a lot of structural support for it."
2,Not what is shown,"A case of you get what you pay for. This item was not what is shown. The item I received does not have the additional padded sides as shown. It is a smooth case, although I expect it will provide a small amount of protection, I had hoped for more."
5,"Protects, and doesnt look too bad!","Title says it... but there is minimal flashing on sides from poor manufacturing, but the price covers it."
5,Wonderful Little Skin Case,"I love this case. The Zune is easy to insert into the case, the belt clip (that I'm using right now) feels sturdy, and I can reach all the buttons with ease. It took me a couple of minutes to figure out how the belt clip was attached to the case, but less than 5 minutes messing around is a small price to pay for a skin that is both rugged and cool looking."
1,"silicone case, Blk","This I did not even use. I ordered the wrong one. I only have a 4gb Zune, in the case was for a 8gb. I just got rid of it."
1,Only one little problem,"This may well be a really nice Zune case.....but it most definitely doesn't fit my 4GB model, nor will it fit the 8 or 16 GB models.It apparently is made to fit the Zune 30, 80 and 120, which you can find out by reading the fine print in some of the reviews. .However, the sales blurb says ""fits Zune"" anbd nothing more...so now I have a really bad nonskid coaster. For about six bucks, including shipping, it's not worth sending back.The product itself is probably just fine on the appropriate model - but the very insufficient description gets it a one star rating."
3,"Regrets, I have a few","It is good to see Patty Duke whenever she is on her game, which is most of the time. However, this set leaves a little to be desired. 1. It failed to include the original pilot. It should have done so. 2. A lot of the episodes, if not all, I think all, were syndicated versions. Scenes ended abruptly and I suspect some scenes were missing. I expect more from the second season. If Shout can't find the original episodes they should say so, as should any distributor so the buying public can make an informed decision. I might have bought it anyway but when blind-sided there is a strong element of being cheated from making up my ownThe Patty Duke Show: Season Onemind and not letting a distributor do it for me. Thanks."
3,"Good, but with major flaws","The story is interesting, if a bit linear, and the dating elements of the game are hilarious! You'll find youself purposefully saying the wrong thing in order to hear the answers you'll get. However, the battle system is incredibly tedious - the one-on-one system, combined with the high random encounter rate, will have you ready to pull out your hair in no time!"
2,I'm At A Loss,"I am totally at a loss for this game. On one hand it has so many original idea's in terms of both plot and gameplay (And has the closest thing to a sim dating game we'll probably ever see), but the way you actually play it leaves me at a loss for words. It's not that the battle system makes no sense, or is bad even, it's the leveling up that confuses me. You don't get stronger when you level up. Your defense gets weaker when you level up. You get more health but you seem to loose more health at the same token too. I'm am at a loss that the creaters of this game could make so many good idea's and make them so poor because they can't figure out commen sense when it comes to leveling up.If you want an RPG that's original get this...just don't exspect to get anywhere with it."
3,Final Fansty 7 a good game,A good game!One bad thing about it is the players don't speak like in Jade cocoon and Brave Fencer Musashi.Other than that it was good.The graphics are O.K. In some parts its boring.It is 3 disks long.I think it is to long.I'd give it 3 stars.FF8 is alot better
4,Anime RPG Game with a Twist,"Forget the standard Final Fantasystory line. In Thousand Arms you play as Mice Triumph a letcherous young man on a quest to regain his kingdom, and woo any young woman in his path. The game features the best voice overs in any game the Playstation has ever made and the graphics are a culmination of Lunar 2 and Final Fantasy VII. For anyone who wants to have a wonderful story in the tradition of anime, and laugh for hours at some of the funniest dialoge yet, then look no farther then Thousand Arms. Warning the game while not anymore violent then any of the Lunar games does contain quite a few sexual innuendos, partly spawning form the unique system of this game where you can go on dates with each girl and try to win her over. This game is suggested for an audience 13 and up."
5,An Awesome Game For Any RPG Fans!,"This game has to be one of the best dating RPG's of all time! The story starts off with a teenager named Meis, who is an apprentice of an old man named Jyabil. As Meis trains to become a Spirit Blacksmith the Dark Accolytes come to invade towns while the Emperor tries to figure out how to become a god. Meis meets alot of pretty girls and you go on dates with them to power up with spells. GET THIS GAME NOW!"
1,a waste of cash,the game its self was good but the ending was such a letdown i had fun playing it making the girls mad but the ending was just so bad that it killed the whole game for me i played 40 hours into it
1,Thosandarms,"i dont know how the game was cause the place i bought it from here sent me a copy so scratched it wouldnt play even after being resurvaced, and it didnt get to me till after the time amazon allows for reterns. Dont by used games online!!!"
4,Good For More Quiet Music,"I keep this in my bedroom, on a shelf behind my bed. The audio isn't very powerful, but the bass stays low, which is good. Why I keep this in my bedroom and not in my sound room is because it is not powerful at all, and better for drum n' bass, emocore, and jazz music. I really don't like the volume buttons, because they're buttons, not a dial, for easy adjustment. It's more of an intimate player, for lack of a better word. If I make mix tapes, I make them here, because they are very good for dubbing and recording. It's an overall good CD player, but it could be better. I like listening to Juxtapose by Tricky with DJ Muggs and Grease on this."
1,Ill-fitting and cheaply made,"From the previous 4 favorable reviews, the case is NOT what I expected after I received it. It is ill-fitting; buttons are hard to use thru the cheap plastic window and thru the side holes. The case has no opening for recharging a battery. In addition, it is not returnable to the seller I purchased it from, so buyer beware."
4,There is finally an expected release date!,This is an incredible manga. I really love the art & style of Kim Kang Won. She has finished Queen's Knight & has restarted the series. I hope that it makes it's target date of September '07 for US release. It looks like it has already been released in Italy...
2,Get the real music,"Although the versions on this CD are similar to the originals, they remind me of those simple mono midi files of old. The music on this CD is karaoke-like, in that the background beat is weak. Some songs are decent, like Monster Mash and Twilight Zone, but just get the originals, not these satisfactory reproductions."
1,"DON""T EVEN GO THERE",I bought this CD at a Dollar Store and it is the biggest waste of money I have ever seen. It is a poor collection of what the artist considers music. I am very dissapointed.
5,five stars jazz album.,"Five stars for this great jazz album by Shakatak..their inventiveness in creating this kind of music is really MAGIC.Never a dull moment listening to this CD, in fact,this is great CD for your car especially for long trips.I have been a jazz fan of Shakatak since they produce their first album.Almost all of my Shakatak collections are their vinyl LP's.Soon I will start collecting their CD's...Enjoy! Enjoy!This is truly MAGIC!!"
4,Gotta Have Shakatak Album...........,"Shakatak continues its excellent venue of smooth jazz and club dance offerrings on this album. Magic has that driving urban beat along with some very upbeat tunes. Particularly noteworty on this album are the cuts, Magic, Nova Bossa and Get Up. This is the perfect CD to turn on in the morning to get you up and going"
5,"From Nightbirds to Magic, What a Fine Musical Journey","I just find their music so special, and this album is right up there with the other jazz greats. Well done!"
1,Zero Company Actual,"This book may be just fine for the conspiracy crowd, but falls far short of the thruth, as the author's political aganda has gotten in the way. The gaps are filled with speculation presented as fact - and those gaps started with the openning words. I guess starting with 1983 during the Reagan years was easier for his agenda than starting in 1978-79, with Carter's own agenda for a highly trained group of assassins in violation of Pres. Ford's Presidential Order. Thank God the CIA double-crossed Carter and wanted a written order before deploying, and he lost the next election. ""No Rules"" for Zero Company."
3,Secret Warriors: Good little stories about Army Operatives,"This book is the only one I have seen of its vintage which discusses operations of US Army counterintelligence agents. Some of the stories have been confirmed by people I have had the chance to speak with. Some of the the details were altered to protect certain items. Careful research of the ESP/PSI related bits in other publications may reveal differing views on the outcome of some operations.It's relatively high level of veracity, easy flow, it was written at the 10th grade level, and humor made it a good read for anyone interested in this topic."
5,Fascinating book!,"Haven't finished reading it yet, but have learned a lot already. Fascinating book which, most of all, emphasises the importance of a loving, caring and supportive environment for optimum child development, and the importance of letting children develop at their own speed. Ties in very nicely with the Ken Robinson books which I'm also reading at the moment."
1,Bad read,"This is the worst mountianeering book I have ever read. Heidi Howkins may have accomplished great feats in her mountianeering career, but writng books is not one. This book is more of an account of the mess she has made of her personal life, rather than high adventure. If you are looking to read about the beauty and tragedy of K2, you will not find it here. You will find failure, and blame. It is a horrible jumbled account of several experiances, several of which do not belong in print."
1,Misleading Title,"When you read a title that reads ""K2 a quest for the summit"" you expect a story about how somebody got to the summit, Heidi did not. This is the story of a woman searching for herself who happens who like mountaineering. I wanted a book about mountaineering and got the troubles and tribulations of a woman in search of herself. Bad read."
1,K2 book review,Having only read the other reviews I think that this book needs a set of AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cables !
3,The footnotes are the best part,"The writing is just OK, the chapters are basically articles that have been published in a newsletter for the Sierra club."
3,Cheap but should do the job,"Considering a 10"" SDS chisel from Bosch is around $15 and this whole set is $22 the low quality case, rough finish to the chisels and bits and very sticky preservative (don't know yet how I'm going to get it off) are probably reasonable trade-offs. If anything breaks on use I will update, but as long as it lasts for a while the value for the price is good. If I was a masonry contractor I would spend the money - probably 10x as much - to have high quality brand-name equipment, but as an occasional user this is just right."
1,Red plastic box with metal,"Just received my order and open the box.... Guys seriously is this a tool or toy? First thing which hit my eye was two colors around carbide drill bits tip; gold and grayish and then I saw how very poorly is carbide blade attached welding is very un even and also full of bubbles....should I continue?!? Ok chisel tip is not only dull, also not correctly sharpened, drill bits (4pc) has gold welding material over carbide tip which makes them nicely rounded =dull. I have not yet try them in the field yet and already have feeling that I will have to run into nearest store in the middle of my job and purchased good ones. Good luck to everybody who will buy it."
5,Real value,Bought these because of price and was surprised to get a pretty good tool set for the price.
3,SDS Hammer Drill Bit Set,"I have used this SDS Hammer Drill Bit Set, it works fine. I would have rather had more drill bits and less chisles, but the quality is good and the price was very good."
5,TOTAL SWEETNESS BABY!,Totaly awesome graphics and gameplay. Able to do awesome tricks includiong front and back flips. Many gameplay modes and characters. STUDLY
4,COOL GAME,"Well since it is the only snowboarding game available for Gameboy Color I have nothing to compare it to. It is pretty fun, but there is boring graphics."
2,Hard to print,I bought these for kiss stickers for my wedding. The sheet stuck in our HP photo smart printer. I lost about 200 labels out of 2000. I ended up having to print them one by one and peel the border stickers off. It was a huge pain and I would not use them again for printing.
5,Using on Beer Bottles,Got these to use for home brewing. Print out and put on the caps - makes reusing the bottles easy as the label is removed with the caps. Not as fancy as making full labels but works well.
2,albeniz - orchestra suite,....recording quality is not the best....sounds like a circus orchestra.......wished you hade the same suite by 'the Orquestra Nacional de Espana'
5,Excellent novelization of a movie.,This book is wonderful and should be read by any Back to the Future trlogy fan. It is a must-read book filled with action and contains a couple of differences with the movie that were probably original ideas not used in the final film.
3,Where's Michael J. Fox?,"Books that come from movies either enrich the story or fall short of it. I think this book did both. It added things that weren't there in the movie, but lacked the natural charm that Michael J. Fox brought to the story. There are many original fine time travel novels out there worth taking a look at, like ""Timeline"" by Michael Crichton or ""Twilight"" by Nicholas Stember, both excellent reads."
5,The 'Bible' on TANTRA,""" He [Osho] proved somewhat prophetic when he told his followers in 1974, ""The days of Tantra are coming. Sooner or later, Tantra will explode for the first time in the masses, because for the first time the time is ripe - ripe to take sex naturally.""THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, December 7, 1998"
5,I keep this book near my bed,...when I am disappointed or I need an advice I open any page and almost always find an answer.
5,.....Master and Disciple.....,"...There is an ancient saying, ""When the disciple is ready the Master appears""....This is the first book of Osho's that came to me in 1977....after reading a few pages...I felt to have found the One...after many sufferings....Rising from sleep one morning....getting ready for work...I look at Osho's photo on the book cover....the thought...I love you...passes through my head.....and Bhagwan appears within me...in Divine Light, Love and Bliss.......are the words spoken in this book of worth?....I know the source....and yes they are."
5,Single Best Book in the World,"I am an avid, wide-ranging reader interested in all subjects. If I lost my personal library with the exception of one book, this is the one book I would not want to lose. Osho is erudite and compassionate, and this book a valuable life-long reference.The Book of Secrets is both deeply profound and highly accessible, a tribute to the patient practical genius of the author. The 112 techniques for self-discovery could be printed on about 10 pages, and the remaining 1,130 pages are the author's commentary plus questions and answers from a live audience. Whatever life and personal issues you may have, they are addressed by Osho in this book.The only shortcoming of this book, especially in light of its length, is the absence of an index. Readers may create their own as they read the book the first time."
5,This is what it is about,"On the first tape of this gentle, perceptive program, Osho explores the Secrets of Love - including the Way of Tantra, the Nature of Desire, the Purest Form of Love, and guidance to Searching for a Soulmate.On the second tape, he turns his focus to the Secrets of Meditation -bringing you to the realization that Your Freedom is Total,and Total Relaxation is the Ultimate, as he also explores the Seed ofBuddhahood, the Joy of Knowing Yourself, and the Breath Within the Breath."
5,Fantastic,"This devotional written by Bonnie Bruno is guaranteed to hook your tween. I happened to leave it around the house and my nine year old found the book, started reading it and raved about it afterwards for hours. It is filled with facts and interesting information to tickle the intellect and encourage the curious. Parents will like its spiritual focus. I'm so glad that I happened to hear about this book.

1,jay-z made a complete fool of himself even more!,"not only is this a very poor version of 2pac's classic 'me & my girlfriend' but jay-z tries to better the original, it is outshone by pac once again, the funniest thing is that jay-z doesnt seem to realise that the original 2pac song wasn't about his girlfriend, he used girlfriend as a metaphor for his gun, but jay-z is too dumb and ignorant to notice this and therefore jay-z puts in a hilarious effort to wrongly recreate a true classic, pac was too smart for jay-z when he was alive and it seems jay-z still doesnt understand pac and is no where near his level of genius even after his death."

3,This is no Prima guide,"I have to say the Prima Guide for Ace Combat 4 was far superior! Brady Games does a fairly good job overall, however, the Prima Guide was much more specific in regards to what you have to do to achieve the ""S"" rankings and unlocking everything on each level. My advice is pretty simple...Save your money, look the stuff up online and print it out. You'll be better off hearing what people have done, and the methods they use to get the highest rankings and how they unlocked everything."
2,Dont expect too much,"this product is not worth the trouble, so like i said dont expect too much! very battery consuming, and not much in the way of extras. It plays music but with out the added features of others.I give this a thumbs down....---peace---"
2,Big disappointment,"Picture quality was poor, the fonts were less readable than on our old monitors. I don't think it was the fault of the video cards, my monitor had higher resolution previously. Also, installation was difficult (had to download drivers from the NEC site) and de-installation (under Windows98) was disastrous; an inexperienced user would have needed tech support to restore the system."

3,Good for amateur microbiologists,"This book does a great job in reviewing the basic tenets of microbiology, however, it doesn't delve into near as much detail as needed for any micro major or graduate student. Sections on molecular bio of bacteria are particularly bad, and metabolic pathways are given only a brief overview (entner-doudoroff has less than 2 pages). That being said, the book does do an excellent job in surveying the vast numbers of microbes, and it virology section is above average for a bacteriology book. Decent intro book, but anyone going into detail should buy something else."
3,Required Text,"Book is well made, content easy to follow. Not much to review, considering it is a required text for Microbiology..."
4,Not for Idiots,"For an artist of Rickie Lee Jones' stature it says a lot about the mediocrity of the average American's musical taste that this album seems to have received only minimal coverage in the press.This is a thinking person's album created by an obviously intelligent musician/lyricist. It's challenging in parts while eclectic throughout.Listening to it, you'll be struck by how quickly the nearly quarter century has passed since R.L.J. first came on the scene.By comparison, 25 years from now, Britney Spears will have been divorced four times, in rehab twice that and probably weighing more than Rosie O'Donnell.What could be grander justice than that?"
3,Not the Best of Rickie Lee Jones,"Very strange that some of RLJ's best songs are not on this anthology. One of the coolest songs ever ""Danny's All-Star Joint"" is missing(!?), as is Easy Money (only a demo is found here) and Ghetto of My Mind is also not included(!?). Jeez Louise!! Why leave out the best??"
2,Not what I expected.,I thought this item came with the cards as well but when received it was only the book. As the cards and the book are normally a set I assumed that is what I was buying. Having said that the book is in good order.
2,Duplicate card boxes were sent,"The product was received in very acceptable condition -- however, one big problem -- duplicate boxes of cards were sent...so we have half the number of trivia questions that we should have received -- very disappointing."
2,eats away the battery,"I bought a month ago and, the light is good but the thing is battery does not last long at all. I had used for a month and used around 3 min per day and within a month battery dead. So before buying one has to remember about the battery life."
4,a good start,"this falls neatly and admittedly a bit predictably into the dystopic-""our world is the only world"" genre. Characterization and world-creation is somewhat sparse, but detracts very little from what is an enjoyable quick read and one well-suited to young adult The story moves along at a good pace and if you see some of the events coming from a while away, DuPrau throws in enough nice small touches so you don't really mind. Nor do you mind the obvious opportunity for a sequel--if the characters are not deeply drawn, they are likable and interesting enough that it would be nice to see them develop further. The book would also work for teachers as a nice companion piece to similar works, such as the Giver or Anthem."

4,The city of ember.,"Wow!Cityof Ember is a really good book because people that are actually in the book talt about their lives. Italso talks what they usually do during their days. What I liked must about the book was that they talk about what they would have to do with out electricity.What Ireally didn't like about the book was it had no pictures. I like the books that have many pictures and extra information because it keeps me on the topic of the book.My favorite part of the book was when this girl was rescued by a boy ,but they don't even say their names.They were my favorite characters because it showed that they care about each other.The part that meant the most to me was when they said that they had no electricity.I really thought about that because I wonder what they do with out electricity. I would say that htis book ROCK! After reading this book my question is, what would happen if they had electricity?Would their lives Chaged? I really recommend this book."
5,Awesome!,"City of Ember is an awesome book. It's written in an extremely unique, steampunk-ish setting, and has interesting characters and an engaging plot. A feeling of tension is kept throughout the book, never letting you forget the threat that looms over the city. It's been some time since I have read such an original, well written story."
4,Pretty Good,"The City Of Ember was a book that I had to read for a project. For a while I thought the book was boring. I had put it down several times, but when my mom foced me to read it got more suspensful. I would say that this book is a little slow to begin but after I finihed the book I said""I guess this book doesn't deserve to go into the shredder after all!"""
5,The City of Ember Review by Michael Xu,"I really enjoyed the book. This was my favorite book. It is about a city underground that is dying because the generator is breaking down and the lights are going off one by one. There are two children, Lina and Doon who found the instructions from the builders. The instructions lead them out of the imperil darkness. How did they do it? Read the book. After this book read the People of the Sparks, The second book of Ember."
4,Read this book,"This book has a good crisis, and the characters are realistic and believable. It has a good solution at the end and answers all your questions."
4,Cornwall New York 6th grader,"The City of Ember was a very suspenseful. I think it was very suspenseful, because there was a lot of mysteries and suspense."
5,A MUST READ FOR GRADES 5 AND UP,MY SON COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. I PICKED IT UP AND READ IT UNTIL I WAS DONE. ITS NOT A BIG BOOK LIKE HARRY POTTER BUT AN AWESOME BOOK THAT A CHILD CAN READ THROUGH AND THOROUGHLY ENJOY. ITS ALOT OF FUN! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL.
2,I did not particulary like this book,"I thought the book The City of Ember was a dull and slow moving book. I would not recommend this book at times i almost fell asleep. The plot of the story doesnt't even really make sense, I think the author could have done a better job at introducing the setting of the story. When Lina and Doon found the new city it was practically the ending it was a very unsuspenseful climax I thought it was very dull.I know there is a sequel to this book, but I am not going to waste my time reading it."
4,PCE student review,"I have read some good books, but The City of Ember is the best. It's about two [...] kids who get jobs. One is a girl named Lina and the other is a boy named Doon. Everything goes well until....well you'll find out! The City of Ember is under my favorite genre: science fiction. It's perfect for teens, kids, and adults.My favorite character is Doon because when the city has problems he is more concerned about the city's generator. He is Lina's best friend. He is loyal, brave, smart, and caring.I think you should definitely buy this book, because during this book I was laughing, smiling, and crying. There is a sequel, but I didn't like it as much! The City of Ember was so good it won the Sunshine State Young Reader's Award in Florida Elementary schools. The author writes it very close to what real boys and girls would say. The plot is unlikely but fun, and is very easy reading so kids all ages can enjoy."
5,Recommended by granddaughter,"This,the first in a series of books, was recommended by my teenage granddaughter. The story had enough suspense to keep me reading and did not have any gratuitous sexual content or foul language. I know it was written for ""young people"", but this 63 year old enjoyed the fantasy very much."
3,Good Debut,"Negatives: Some of the world-building and plotting here is not quite believable. The characters frequently make accurate guesses at things; on one hand the author does a lot of explaining to show how things are realistic, but on the other hand she skirts away from lots of important details, like oxygen and physical environment in Ember; lots of coincidences fill in where the plotting seems to have been botched.Positives: Interesting characters, good pacing for the most part, lots of unique ideas tied together fairly well. The book has a good start and a good finish, with only a few real fumbles along the way.Overall: A cool, interesting read, with lots of good ideas and lots of good execution. A solid 3.5 Stars."
3,Higher expectations,"Reading the reviews, I was expecting a really compelling and entertaining book. Unfortunately, I did not get it. Overall it was a good concept, but it never seem to full develop. The main characters seem to lack depth. Personally, I did not feel a real connection with either of them. The plot was interesting, but seemed a bit dumb down I guess for the intended YA audience. I did enjoy the description of the city. While reading I did get a good sense of what it looked and felt like. Maybe my expectations were a little high. The book is worth reading, so if it is in library I would go that route."
4,A great read!,"This was a very imaginative look at a dystopian future, and a warning call to all of us about the possibility of annihilation of most life. I enjoy reading children's literature and feel this is a good addition to that genre. However, I did not like the follow-up prequel, ""The Prophet of Yonwood,"" as much and felt that the inclusion of pictures in that book was distracting."
4,"Entertaining, and a great book for young readers.","I actually really enjoyed this book! It was a quick and easy read, only taking me an afternoon to read it, but it was also very interesting! Lina and Doon are two twelve year olds beginning their new lives among the workforce of the city of Ember. But things aren't going well for the city. The lights that keep the darkness at bay have begun to run down, food and clothing are short, but there is no way to leave the city, or any knowledge of anything beyond the dark unknowns. Lina and Doon begin to unlock the mystery left behind by the Builders, the creators of their city two hundred years ago. This is definitely a book my kids would like, and it is refreshingly clean without unnecessary language or innuendos"
4,City of Ember Review By a third grade boy,"The problem in the City of Ember is having too many black outs. First Lina and Doon have to fix the generator but it does not work so they have to do a whole different plan. A girl named Lina is a character in the story and she is very caring for her family. There is a boy named Doon and he is curious but does not care for his family. I liked the book because it has action and has alot of mysteries. I also liked the ending of the story because it is mixed with happy parts,mysteries,and action. You should read this book because it has alot of mysteries. Will Doon and Lina make this plan work? Read to find out."
5,The City of Ember is my favorite book!!!!!!,"This is the best book I have ever read! It is about a city that is starting to have power shortages, and shortages of everything else. It has a very interesting plot and you won't be able to put it down until you're done. I read it in 1 day! In other words, buy it!"
4,cornwall new york 6th grader,"i am a sixth grader. I liked The City of Ember a lot! I liked it because it was a mystery. I didn't know where Ember was until the end. So, I recommend you read the book!!"
4,Windsor Junior High School Cora C.,I really liked The City Of Ember. I liked The City Of Ember because there was a lot of mystery and suspense. I reallyloved the ending and can't wait to read the sequal. I reallyreccomend this book to everyone.
5,"From Colleen, Age 12","The City of Ember was the best book I have ever read. Jeanne DuPrau is a great writer. Her book kept me up all night reading which is very rare for me. I hate reading. One thing I loved about Duprau's writing was the foreshadowing in her book. The City of Ember kept me on my toes. You knew something was happening but you could never figure out what until it happened. The book was just a big giant puzzle. The characters would remind you of yourself at times. Unlike other books, this one was totally unpredictable. It was funny, sad and mysterious all at the same time."

3,One for the kids,"The really good dystopian books for kids push the boundaries of their reading abilities and of their reasoning skills. They make them ask ""what if"" type questions, and introduce, however mildly, unsettling ideas. Dystopian books are, after all, mostly books about ideas and possibilities.This book is perfectly fine, but it doesn't offer much of a challenge. There is little conflict and little dramatic tension. The kids live in an interesting broken down place, surrounded by fairly passive adults. They resolve to escape. They do things and things happen.I don't mean to be unfair. This is a very creative effort. It would be a wonderful introduction to fantasy/adventure that is more than unicorns and singing swords. It could certainly fire a young reader's imagination. But the key here is ""young reader"". I don't see this offering much to a reader beyond early elementary level."
5,Great Movie for kids!,"My son had to read this book for his book club at school and once they finished the book, they could get the movie - and my son is glad we did! He loved it and honestly I did as well, without reading the book!"
5,near perfect YA novel,"'The City of Ember' by Jeanne DuPrau is an excellent young adult novel that had me hooked within the first page. The 'Builders' have built a city for a number of people to survive some unnamed catastrophe in safety, however since it won't be safe to leave the city for at least 200 years, they have deliberately made it difficult for anyone to leave. Instructions on how to leave were entrusted to the first mayor but over time the instructions have become lost and as the story opens 240 years and the city is beginning to fall into ruin and decay...The story reminded me of Arthur C Clarke's 'The City and the Stars' about a city whose inhabitants have long ago lost any knowledge of the outside world, and a young teen who discovers a way out."
4,"Cornwall, New York 6th Grader",I am a sixth grader. The City of Ember was a pretty good book. I liked it because it kept you guessing. There were many events where you wanted to keep reading to find out what happened. This book was very interesting.
5,Outstanding!,"This book is most certainly not recieving the praise it deserves. It is so extremly gripping, that i could not put it down, yet at the same time, i read it slower than just about any book i have ever read for one reason, and that reason is; it was sooooo incredibly good, i simply didn't want it to be over. I cannot wait until i own ""The People of Sparks"". Though at some points, the City of Ember was a bit on the predictable side, I still absolutely loved it . The author had an almost ""magical power"" of keeping the book interesting. THis is a book that will most definitely be passed about between my friends. THe best part in my opinion is the way the author intertwined science fiction with the fantastical and borderline realistic factors. I am not a big fan of Sci-fi, but i would reccomend this book to just about anyone. lovers of sci-fi and non-lovers alike. I could continue rambling about how fantastic the City of Ember is, but I'll let you go read it instead, so hurry along!"
3,new take on old theme,"Fascinating read. Basically the same theme asThis Time of Darkness(by H.M. Hoover) published 1980, which also features two kids escaping an underground city in a post-apocalyptic dystopia."
5,clever concept,my daughter was assigned this book and we read it together.....i was genuinely hooked on the book! it reminded me of the goonies a littlebit.
4,soon to be a motion picture!!,"I had this book in my wish list for a while. I liked the premise, and it sounded as if it would be a great read. Ultimately I did not purchase it...until I went to the movies last weekend and saw a trailer for the movie based on this book. And it looked spectacular. And so, next day, I went and purchased it. I am glad I did. It is billed as a children's book, but so is the Harry Potter series, and we all know it is well loved by adults and children alike. I did like this book, although I found it a bit short, at less than 400 pages. I can't wait for the movie to come out."
4,Windsor Jr. High-Kyle W.,"This was a new type of science fiction that kept me guessing the whole time. It had many twists in the plot, featuring some interesting characters. I'm not usuall a science fiction guy, but as I would describe it, it's science fiction for those who hate science fiction. Every chapter leaves you hanging, especially the end! I loved it and would recommend it. Most nights I would find myself reading past my intentions because of the suspense."
4,Something New for Young Adult Literature,"I picked this book up on a whim and I was not disappointed. The City of Ember is truly an inventive young adult book that is very appealing for adults as well. This would be a terrific book for you to read w/ your children and discuss. The themes of complacency, individualism and hope are set in a very intriguing enviroment.I always had to give too much of a spoiler but Duprau creates a new type of world that you don't see often in a young adult novel. I recommend this book for ages 10 and up and would find it very intriguing if it was taught in a classroom setting as well. (now if I just had some kids to home school!)"
1,... Wierd^...,"I am not Andrew I am his son. I like this book. I give it 5 $TARZ, but that kid ^is WIERD! Say Lol in your review if you agree."
1,Blaaa,THEIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ ECEPT FOR Just Juice IT WOULD BE THE WORST I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS BUT THAT WAS NOT AN OPSHINE!
2,"Cornwall,new york 6th grader",I did not enjoy The City of Ember. I didn't like it because it didn't interest me. To me it had no point. The book was to make believe. It is a good book if you are a fourth grader. It is not challenging at all ; you just need to have an imagination.
3,A great book with a horrible plaque,"This was a great book, interesting character development, a great environment... but one thing led to the downfall of it. I call it The Curse of The Baby. It's when a baby is thrown into a journey for no reason at all. Prehaps more character development? Yes, but when the Curse strikes, Lina (the main character) is already with someone else. The baby was just thrown it to be cute. Also, there are a lot of similarities to The Giver in this book. For example, kids at twelve get assignments to do in the community. Many things are unexplained, for example, why did the city turn on the two kids after they gave proof of something? Read this book if you want a unigue book, but don't mind some subtle flaws."
2,Caleb,What is the point of this book can anyone tell me and is this really a city of ember and if it is what is ember
4,The Light in the Dark,"""Goodbye to Ember"" Lina thought. ""Goodbye to everyone, goodbye to everything.""The City of Ember is a fabulous and consuming novel because it is filled with adventures and emotions. There are lots of adventures in this volume. One of them is when Lina wanders in to the unknown regions, a land of darkness that surrounds the city. This was an adventure because no one has entered the depths of the unknown regions and been sane enough to tell the story. There is also emotion in this book because the city is in peril for they are running out of supplies and they can't escape from the city. This is a part that made me very nervous because of the suspense. Another emotional part is when someone who is thought of as a friend turns out to be a threat to the city's survival, and by survival I mean they are taking something important from the city.-Noa"
4,Good book,IT has twist and turns and the idea of the book is just great! :D not too short gives good ex of what the r talking about too
5,love it,It was a wonderful book and I cant wait for the rest of the series! It was absolutely thrilling! thanks so much!
3,"Great concept, weak presentation","I really enjoyed this book, but I still feel that it could've been written better. The initial concept was amazing and unique (this was before all of these other dystopian books I should mention), but its presentation was really lacking. The prose stayed the same all the way through; the two main characters are supposed to be different but they both think the same, which is a plot hole that contradicts the story. Dialogue was a bit unrealistic; it was either completely flat or overly-dramatized.However, it was definitely worth the buy and the read!"
3,windsor jr. high-jp and nsh,"We thought this book was pretty interesting. The book was very suspenseful and kept us hooked on to it. At the end of the book there's a lot of questions that make you want to read the sequel, the People of Sparks."
3,windsor jr. high school- chrystal,"I thought this book was okay because it on and off with adventure. I gave it three stars because it wasn't the worse book, but it was itn't the best. The under ground adventure was interesting, but the never ending talking was boaring. I would recamend it because it is a on going adventure when you think about what it could be."
5,It was GREAT!!!,"This book had you staying up all night trying to find out what happens. It's exciting, it's mysterious, and it makes you feel like you have so many things to be grateful for. I LOVED IT!!!!!"
4,Great series starter,"I read this after seeing the movie, and it far exceeded my expectations. I have now read the whole series and enjoyed it. I felt that this one had a bit of a slow start, but an exciting, page turning ending. Overall, a good book. I have already recommended to several students."
4,"Exciting story, but...","After reading The City of Ember, I was very excited about reading the next book. I found it to be a wonderfully creative story. I wasn't bothered about the unexplained details; this is, after all, a work of fantasy. I would have highly recommended this book until I read the second, The People of Sparks. I was deeply troubled by the lack of any faith. People had become completely humanistic without a shred of belief in God or, if you like, a higher power. Then I read the third book, The Prophet of Yonwood. In this book, religion has become a tool used by a few to direct the actions of the many. This is not to say that this doesn't happen, but it smacked of The Communist Manifesto. I am truly sorry to say that I would not recommend this set of books to anyone who is a Christian, unless their beliefs are solid."
4,Enjoyable.,"Just a warning for those who are thinking of reading this book; this is a young adult book. I ordered it thinking this was a normal adult novel. Boy was I surprised when I got it in the mail. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, just not what I was expecting.So if you're looking for a ""filler"" book like I sometimes do, this would be a good choice. It can easily be read in a couple days. I haven't yet read the next book in this series but I'm planning on it."
4,Electric!,This book is very well written and will keep readers curious throughout the whole book. Readers will be dying to read the sequel to this exilherating book! This book definitely deserves four stars!
5,Review for the The City of Ember,"The City of EmberJeanne DuPrauWhen Lina is given the job of pipe works and Doon is given messenger they decide to switch. Doon finds out the problems the city is facing. But there is no way to help.Then the blackouts start happing. Will the city be stuck forever?Jeanne DuPrau does a fantastic job with this book. It's filled with suspense. This funny mystery Lina and Doon join forces and save the city and escape from darkness.This book is so awesome. The characters are really funny, witty and daring, which might help save the city."
3,Interesting but...,"I enjoyed this book. It's short, moves quickly and has a fascinating, original premise. The characters are a little iffy though and the characterisation shallow. My other problem was the lack of tension. We know from the start what Ember is and what the children are going to find. I'm not sure why the author gave away so much of the story up front. It's a welcome relief from magic, dragons and all the rest though."
3,Blah,"It was not exciting, it did not catch my attention. The author failed to use words to make the reader believe they were in the City of Ember."
2,Get yourself a slightly BETTER book. (for your own sake),"Well, if you've heard this is a great book, think again! This is ANOTHER futuristic dystopia book. What a bore. To start out, you get the feeling of boringness right off the bat, as Lina gets herself a terrible job and is depressed. And then, like a dream, Doon (vomit... what a name) somehow wants to trade and Lina is all happy again. Where have you seen that kind turnaround before? EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!! In any case, once it even gets to the meat of the story, you find out that some mayor hid the key to the outside world. Exciting yet? Probably not. And then you see they miraculously get to the outside world and see all these strange people and then you have to read the next book and NOTHING'S HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!! Imagine reading the ENTIRE SERIES!!!!!!!!!! Why would you read this book? Seriously! SAVE YOURSELF!!!!"
2,cornwall newyork sixth grader,I dislike the book City Of Ember because it was a boring book and was too much like a mystery book. Also the kid's were kind of stupid because they didn't know were they were. Also the book didn't interest me very much there wasn't any love or sad parts in the story. When I first started reading it I thought it was going to be very good but I stopped reading because it was not interesting at all and I'm sorry to the one's who thought it was great but this is my opinion and I thought it stunk.
2,No Pullman,"My general view of this book is that its author is trying to be the next Philip Pullman. Just as Eragon is trying to be the new Tolkien and Ardagh's books are trying to be the new Series of Unfortunate Events. However, the His Dark Materials trilogy is amazing. Expertly written with excellent flow and character development. The same cannot be said for this. I have to say that I'm disappointed not to have liked it. The original idea seemed engaging. The actual book however, was not."
2,Shedding Light on The Book The City of Ember,The City of Ember's plot is there is a girl named LIna. She is discovering that the city is running low on supplies. Lina is always dreaming of a new city that is ten times better. The city is also underground and is only light by lights that go on and off at certain times. Lina really wants to leave the city. I liked that there was alot of characters. It was fun because you could see who did what. I disliked that there wasn't enough action. This book is just as good as The People of Sparks. It is really interesting because its like The City of Ember.
2,GROAN and eyeroll -el stinko,"As I was reading this book to my kids I rolled my eyes and groaned so many times. I had to force myself to finish the story it was so implausible. I found it hard to believe that Doon is the first person in 240 years to have enough curiousity to search through the pipeworks. It seems that in 240 years no one has even tried to do any innovation, to figure out the generator, to make new things out of trash. I found it hard to believe that they all just lived for 240 years with no curiousity. The fact that there were no books seems to have only been thrown in to make the story work not because it made any sense. Didn't they bring batteries? Flashlights? Just dumb people existing for 240 years. I only give it 2 stars because it was well written and my kids liked it."
2,Book Review,The City of Ember was an exciting fun adventure. The description of the book was really good. That's one of the reasons I liked the book. The City of Ember is about a boy and a girl that live in this city that is starting to have a lot of power outages. So the boy and the girl must find a way to get the electricity back. But the ending was very dissapointing because I was expecting a big suprise but it was very big. That is how I rate the city of ember.
4,views on the book,"i checked this book out at the local library and expected more out of it when i first picked it up. at first it seemed like the author was trying too hard to come with words that she felt sure about, using a somewhat strange style,the first few chapters were uneasy to read. although much of the story was obvious and predictable, i found that the concept reeled me in.i would rate this a 3.5, but that eventually rounds out to a 4."
5,City of Ember Review,"The book ""City of Ember"" was a spectacular adventure book and I reccommend it to everyone. The story was set upon an amazing split and it touched my heart, excuse me i'm going to go grab a tissue. When I turn 18 i'm going to make all my kids read this book as their first! The entire book seemed depressing until the end and everyone was happy again. At first I figured it was going to be boring, but I kept turning the pages and it just lifened my day. A lot of moments I was waiting for the two main characters, Lina and Doon,(to have a climax moment), but it never happened. This book truly touched my heart."
3,"an excellent fairy tale, not great for adults","THE CITY OF EMBER is a fairy tale, a story stripped down to its essentials and laden with morals and lessons. Everything is a bit simplified - and, as a result, the book has the otherworldly, timeless feel of a Cinderella or a Goldilocks.I'm one of those adults who has discovered that a lot of the best new books are found on children's and YA shelves. A lot of these books are well-written enough, complex enough, to appeal equally to adults and children. THE CITY OF EMBER is not one of these books - it's good, but will probably only satisfy its designated audience."
2,"Good Concept, Bad Writing","This is a fun book, don't get me wrong, but it's crushed underneath some of the worst, most neophytical writing I've ever seen! Plot inconsistancies, terrible dialogue, idiotic characters, it would be a flunk-out in the writing realm if it wasn't for the incredibly cool concept of the City of Ember. I recommend reading it at the library, but not worth my money to buy."
3,Solid starter dystopia,"I had been wanting to read this book for awhile, partially for its slighlty steampunk setting, but mostly because a non-reader friend of mine raved to me about how he couldn't put it down. It was pretty interesting and reluctant-reader friendly: fascinating setting, sympathetic characters, and the plot was definitely nail-bitingly tense towards the end. There were a few things that seemed really contrived (really, the box containing the key to the city's survival sat, forgotten, in a closet for a few hundred years? And is discovered Just in the Nick of Time?), but it's still a solid starter-dystopia. I'd suggest this to kids who are still reading the early Harry Potter books and other fairly easy chapter books with a (very) slight edge to them.[...]"
2,Not for adult fans of YA fantasy,"I loved the premise of City of Ember - and bought this read since I had recently finished the Hunger Games series and this seemed to be in the same realm. Plot-wise - yes. But years behind in character development and story-telling. There was a good chunk of the book where I couldn't put it down, but after staying up late last night to finish it up, I was like ""this is it????"". I had no desire to get the second book in the series. The writing is just too weak and even at the end, I really didn't care if the characters succeeded or not."
2,Great story - great concept -written like the intended audience was 11 years old,"I loved the concept behind this book! The characters were pretty good too. It just was written as if the intended audience were 4th graders and although overall I enjoyed reading it - this story could have been AMAZING if the author had fleshed out the plot, setting and characters a bit more and it just kills me!! I felt kind of ripped off for the price (6.99) and because of that I chose not to trust the author enough to buy any additional books in the series."
3,windsor jr high school-lv,This book was a great mystery and a good use of imagination. I never would have guessed where Ember ended up being. I enjoyed the book and I like it better then the people of sparks. I had a fun time trying to figure out the paper that Poppy chewed up. I recommend it to people who like mysteries.
3,"Unimpressed-- Read a More Exciting, Page-turning Book","-plot is 2 slow, few antagonists other than mayor & fear of unknown-incomplete storyline/doesn't stand by itself-too predictable at end/no surprises/no plot twists/normal ""heroes save the day"" plot-too much unnecessary desc about random items+fantasical, orginal plot about a hundreds yr human science experiment+excellent character developement that I cared about/flawed characters+powerful theme about family & selfishness"
3,A glowing beginning...,"This is a very energizing book, that will certainly be enjoyed by both girls and boys in a wide age group (as well as their parents!) The mystery and adventure will draw in the most reluctant reader, and more savvy readers will enjoy recognizing clues to the true nature of the City of Ember and the mysterious message found by the protagonists.My only reserve about the book is that it doesn't really ""end"" per se...the resolution is obviously leading to a follow up book instead of being a pure stand-alone story. I like series books (ie Harry Potter, Molly Moon, Chronicles of Narnia), but the best series books stand alone when presented, while this one only ""sort of"" does that.However, I will be reading the follow up, to be sure!"
2,windsor jur. high/joey,I thought that it was intresting but boring because their wasn't really any thing that i thought wa that exiting
2,Windsor JR. High School- Josh P.,I didn't like it that much but some parts wear ok. Like when Donn was looking at bugs.
1,Windsor Jr/Sr High-JL,I thought this book was intresting but not intresting enough. The book was not suspenseful. One reason I did not like the book is because it was assigned to me to read for english. There are alot of questions that were not answered in the book which I did not think was good.
1,This is a joke? Right?,"This book was not the greatest one in the world. Its predictability was a big let down in the book and what is with the, 'Box will open when its ready' thing? I know, the builders were like the change of the nation, but how could a box like that correspond to the Generator and when it isnt fully dark, but when it flickers? It doesnt make sense. Jeanne DuPrau should have put more effort into this book and I have no plan on reading the sequel. They already confirmed that they get into a city and come above ground at the little, 'Sneak Peek' at the end and that they take them in! Bad bad bad bad bad book!"
3,It was not my favorite book.,"The City of Ember. I gave this book 3 stars. It was not very interesting to me. The plot seemed to be very stupid, and the kids were ignorant."
3,Windsor Junior High-AS,This book was a great mystery. It was suspesful and you didn't know what would happen next. I think that Lina and Doon are a good team but they are very different. They compliment each other because they are so different.
3,windsor Jr.high school- Amber H.,I think this book was okay it was not horrible and it was not the best book I have ever read in my whole life. This book was a lot like the giver i did not really like the Giver that much. That is why i gave it 3 stars. I think this book is better then the Giver it is more interesting and for kids my age. I think people in the 7th grade should read this book.
5,Great read-aloud,"I chose this book as the first read-aloud of the year for my 6th grade students. It had a bit of a slow beginning, but they were begging for more read-aloud time by the end. It is a very suspenseful book with an original twist on the idea of a utopian society. I also like that it has a strong (but human) heroine in Lina Mayfleet."
4,It's a really good book!,"It's a story of betrayal, discovery and evil. The ending is bittersweet. My favorite part was when the hero gets caught by the guards and outwits them and escapes. It is easy to read, but would not recommend it to kids under ten because of the vocabulary."
3,Ella clipper,It's ok it's boring sometimes but it nice and suspenseful the end is great it's all like omg it's cool
3,Good Read,This is a good scifi book. I hope the rest continue to be good. Would recommend to anyone just starting to read scifi.
3,Very farfetched,"My daughter in law teaches 6th grade and I picked this book up ather house and started to read. It caught my attention because thewriting is really captivating. It was not my usual type, but it wassuch a quick read. Very imaginative. How do people think of thesethings? And, of course, the ending was quite surprising. I passed iton to my friend who was surprised that I would have sent it on to her."
5,loved it,I loved the book the ending was a bit bland but still so well written and all the clues and such that were given through out the book were great

4,Good Middle Grade Listen...,"This is an audio that I really enjoyed. It reads (listens?) like a middle grade book. The people of ember were a bit innocent because they were so protected and controlled. I loved to listen as they discovered things like matches. At the same time, these moments could be a bit boring since I knew what they were and I just wanted them to hurry up and figure it out too. I really really loved the narrator and I initially picked this series because it was short ;) but I fell in love with the sweet story. I think this is a great story to listen to with your kids (if you are in the habit of doing this). I didn't get lost or feel like the story was too drawn out. It is a cute story."
3,Good read for age 9 - 12,"DuPrau creates a city hidden underground to safeguard the last of humanity from a great disaster. Although safe from whatever is happening on the surface, the residents experience an ever present fear of darkness as the city begins to deteriorate and its source of light experiences regular break-downs. Two youth realise the danger they are all about to face, despite the denials of the mayor, who has his own secret to hide. Undaunted, the two young friends discover the truth and begin to gently challenge the status quo with their investigations. This is a good book for 9 - 12 year olds."
5,The City of Ember,"The City of Ember was an easy but enthralling read, so ridiculously easy to love. The characters were so real in this unreal world, presented with plenty of exposition. Plotwise, the book excels, with plenty of fast-paced suspense carrying the reader steadily through the book. The characters act so realistically--like the children they are, but with unambiguous bravery. It's full of the characterization symbolism, and other literary elements that teachers crave, but also filled with wonder, suspense, and just an amazing plot that kids of all ages will enjoy. It ends on a cliffhanger, so I strongly suggest having the second book on hand to immediately jump into--trust me, you'll want to have it.Rating: 5/5"
3,Probably good enough for children. Not the new Wizard of Oz,"I'll spare you the plot synopsis since many others have gone through it. This book has many inconsistencies and plot holes. The premise is not terribly original. It (like so many books these days) stars children who do not act or think like children. The protagonists are 12 but if I changed that one line in the book to make them 30 it would read exactly the samewithout going point by point into all the problems i just wanted to say that if you're buying this for a child under 13 or so its probably going to be fine and well enjoyed. If you're an adult who occasionally reads well written young adult fiction, skip this because its nothing special"
3,Very solid YA Fiction,"I bought this book for the Kindle because it was recommended to me by Amazon after I bought The Hunger Games.This book sits very squarely in the category of ""Grade 4-8"". Adults will find themselves pulling their hair at some of the behavior/decisions made between Doon and Lina. The story is relatively slow until about 2/3rds through when you can tell the author realized ""Uh oh, 12 year olds are gettin' bored, better finish it up!"" The attention to detail is inconsistent, especially when it comes to the actions of The Builders.But for preteens just getting into fantasy thrillers, this is a great place to start. Doon's father and Clary have some great messages to share with children like ""If you can't master your anger, your anger will become the master of you.""I personally will not continue reading through the rest of the series, and I'd recommend that you just borrow it from the library."
3,Intriuging but....,"i just loved the city of ember, but jeanne duprau messed the series up. if u read the 3rd book; the prophet of yonwood, it says to read the city of ember series backward!!!! which makes sense NOW. but its labled:city of ember BOOK 1the people of sparks BOOK 2the prophet of yonwood BOOK 3.....i felt this series would've been soooo much better if that was stated somewhere when i 1st bought the city of ember. so if u look to buy this series i would suggest reading it from books 4 to 1. it will make ur understanding of the book SO MUCH SIMPLER.HOPE THIS HELPS"
3,"A ""The Giver' Fan","I am a fan of the book ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry, and the two books that come after it, ""Gathering Blue"", and ""The Messenger"". They are all set in societies in the future, much like the City of Ember, and I was told I would like this series as well.I didn't like it nearly as much, and here is why: They seemed contrived, and less creative. The baby in the story was not baby-like, it was the baby from a series of unfortunate events. It didn't act like a REAL baby. All of the adults, other than the gardener, were careless and ignorant. The story itself had flow, but the characters and the actions they took irritated me.Another futuristic book that I liked was ""The Hunger Games"". This was entertaining, but it wasn't something I would recommend buying. In fact, I returned my copies."
5,Ember book series,I bought all 4 books in the Ember Series for my Granddaughter. She enjoyed each one.
3,"Good, overall pleasing","The beginning struck me as a little slow, but overall, I enjoyed this book. The pace was good. Lina was a somewhat flat character, but she was made up for by Doon, who was satisfyingly made. I think this book would have improved if the characters were a tad more complex and less predictable, but overall I enjoyed the story. I predicted the ending (which is never good, in my opinion) but it wasn't an unsatisfying ending. The next book should be interesting."
2,No logic,"As I was reading this novel it bothered me that the author did not explain why there were no books on Physics or Electricity and Magnetism to explain how the world works. How could a society build an underground city yet fail to provide the future citizens with any means to educate themselves. This book reminds me of ""Orphans of the Sky"" By Robert A. Heinlein. A much better book with a great explanation why all the knowledge was lost. A true science fiction book that respects its audience gives plausible well thought out scenarios that can be believed. This book fails to do that. Come on, the workings of a direct current electrical generator can be understood by a grade school child. I cant believe a society that relies on one for their survival could ""forget"" how they work."
3,My daughter will love it.,"I previewed this for my 9 year old daughter. I think she will really enjoy it. It was a unique and interesting story. The descriptions were vivid, and the characters were engaging. Plus, it will be interesting to discuss the idea of limited resources with her and how we can use the lessons of Ember to be better stewards and citizens of earth. Also, it was wonderful to have such young heroes, and to realize that you are never too young to make a difference."
4,"Alternative world, where a witch and warlock are heroes.","Poul Anderson creates an alternative world where magic is found to work around the time of WW1, and feature a husband-and-wife team of a werewolf and witch. A framing sequence works around several short stories, but it focuses on the end on their child...which has been kidnapped into Hell, literally...and how they invaded Hell itself to get their child back. As usual, Poul does a complete world and thinks out the ramifications of such magic wonderfully. Unfortunately, also as usual, oftentimes his language isn't natural, but expository. But don't let that stop you...this is still an EXCELLENT read, proving even Hell itself is not proof against fierce parental love"
5,a rare delight,"Treska provides a wonderfully illustrated children's story of life at Grandfather' farm. The country setting and simple time of hard work, take us back to a place and setting where nature was appreciated for its many pleasures, and family was a cherished gift. The author's European childhood memories are revealed through the eyes of this young girl's experiences with her grandfather."
4,Bookmark patterns Included!,"This book is highly unique in the fact that in addition to bulletin board ideas and patterns, it includes a bookmark for teachers and librarians that goes with the theme of the board. What a wonderful idea! I would highly reccommend this book as a great addition to a library's or teacher's professional collection."
5,Fun CD,This CD is fun to listen to for both young & old. You'll find yourself singing & dancing around the house in no time!!!
4,Brought me back to HS!,"I found this book incredibly funny and it really brought me back to High School. My childhood best friend gave me the book last year and I finally got a chance to read it this holiday weekend and I couldn't put it down. It was a funny, lighthearted, easy read."
2,Way too British for most American teens,"I teach English/Reading in high school and thought that this would appeal to high school boys. After reading it...probably not. First of all, they would have to ask me to translate the British slang literally every other page. The teen boy humor isn't funny to a 15 year old if you aren't familiar with the terms ""shag"" or ""fag"" (not the homosexual type. Perhaps, there's an off chance that they've watched the original ""The Office"" or ""The Spy who Shagged Me"" with Austin Powers but otherwise, it's just all lost on them. Most of the book is a bunch of adolescent boys talking about sex, not actually having it. Fairly harmless."
3,British Pie?,"This novel follows the lives of Dino, Jon and Ben, three sixteen year olds who American Pie style want to get laid real bad. Along the way a fat interested girl, suicidal teacher, doctor, girlfriend who says she's ready but never puts out and a drugged out 14 year old are part of their adventures to manhood.Not the most fascinating book out there but if you liked the movie American Pie and wonder what it would have been like with British characters then check this out."
5,The sociology of fame.,This is a great book if you are intereseted in the theories of why people seek fame and what it does to them. Very interesting investigation of the theories that have been presented over time. This book even goes back to Homer for some historical references to fame and it's attainment. A great read but not for those uninterested in pschology.
3,Read 'The Psychology of Fame' and 'Frenzy of Renown' instead,"I have read many books in the ever expanding literature on the 'fame' phenomenon and this one came as a bit of a disappointment. The title seemed inviting and I expected a psychological view on the workings of this illusion of being immortal, but somehow it seemed to be just a randomly chosen title. After putting it down, I realized the book had not given me anything new on the subject!The book is a good read for the beginner nevertheless, but The Psychology of Fame is a much better researched book that does deliver (interesting anecdotes and new insights), like of course the best work so far on fame, Braudy's Frenzy of Renown.Especially considering the price of the Illusion of Immortality, I would advice to buy the other titles first."
2,"Great Contrast, Small Footprint, Poor Color",I ordered this monitor because it was a NEC and fit nicely into my new wall desk. The monitor I received had extremely washed out color. Three phone calls to NEC service finally got me a replacement set with a slight improvement in color quality. I would not buy this monitor again.
5,NEC MultiSync LCD 1525M,"The NEC MultiSync LCD 1525M monitor has excellent color and runs on low voltage making it far more cost effective and it saves your eyes, much easier to look at, while doing long periods of computer work. It was very easy to install and came with instructions for various hook-up formats.I'm very pleased with my NEC MultiSync moniter. LCD is the way to go if you can afford it... as the prices go down and the availability of LCD becomes the standard, it will become the only way to view your computer. The NEC has a very small footprint and the weight is a lot less than the CRT."
2,Is Jamul how you spell Rubicon??????,"I have tried to order the CD Jamul, a band from California in the late 60's and I keep getting sent this ""Rubicon"" CD. They even have the title Jamul, and then you start reading about Rubicon, Blah Blah. I've even order from 2 different sites(15 new and used for $15.99 etc etc) section and 1 of them sent me the same Rubicon CD, even though it has Jamul on the invoice!!!At least one of them just refunded my money and said they didn't have it. (probably they actually got the CD out and physically read the title, instead of accepting the read out of a bar code scanner) Avoid this title and the revolving door it presents to the buyer, at least until someone gets their act together."
4,Bring it back,"Its time to bring back this important work by Earl Radmacher. In a day when the Church is being tinkered with as if it were some kind of silly puddy, we need works that are rooted in the revelation of Scripture and not driven by cultural pop-trends.D Fredericks"
5,Excellent lantern for camping or night light,"I've had this lantern for many years and it works great. I usually don't write reviews for products, but this product is worth my time to write a review. Light weight, high durability, 3 light settings. Love it Love it!! I'm buying two more for night lights.It may not provide as brightness as you expect for camping, but it works for small tents. It has recharger comes along as well as you can charge the battery with manual crank handle."
5,Megabrite self powered lantern,"I bought 4 of these to use as night lights or play with. My kids love it. I don't have to think about them forgetting to turn it off and wasting electricity or batteries. I think the single light setting is perfect as a night light, and all 9 lights makes a very good lantern. We usually crank it a good 2 minutes. The single light will last for hours, but having all 9 LEDs on definitely grows dim much quicker. Great for camping or emergencies. Best part is no dead batteries!"
5,I really like Marco Reed's workout.,I really liked this workout when it was on exercise t.v. so now that it is not on demand anymore it was nice to be able to get it. It is a good workout and not like all the rest. I like the variety and that is pushes me.
1,"How Soy Became ""Healthy"" .. . and Profitable!","If you ever wanted to know how soy went from an unprofitable ""poverty food"" to the fastest growing segment of the health food industry, you must read this book. It tells exactly how the soy industry plays ""consumer helper"" and encourages soy consumption with the use of ""health claims"" that have been carefully created through the power of public relations, the corruption of scientific inquiry, and the collusion of the FDA. More than 60 years of studies link soy protein and soy oil to malnutrition, digestive distress, immune system breakdown, thyroid disorders, infertility, reproductive system problems, and even cancer growth. Yet soy is now widely perceived as a ""health food"" for men, women and children. This book tells why and how. It's a five star book for marketers that gets one star because its authors fail to acknowledge the industry's shabby and slippery ethics and its shameless putting of profits before people."
3,Average,"I was so excited to finally find a copy of this game and eagerly awaited for it to arrive....excited until I played it. It is nowhere near as exciting as I thought it would be having read all the reviews. I mean it's ok for an average game but that's it. The only really good part is when you are at sea in your ship. At sea, the graphics are really good. Watch out for those storms though. I have been playing for about 4 hrs or so now and those storms sink my ships every single time. Must be some trick to survive them I guess. We shall see. If you find this cheap somewhere, pick it up. But I wouldn't spend too much money on it."
2,needs work,"the game is clearly unfinished. It is frustrating to play - just moving around is a chore. Moreover - game freezes quite often for a few seconds. Since it is for Xbox - there's nothing you can do about it.The ideas for gameplay are great, as well as graphics, but - unless you are unhumanly patient - you will not be able to enjoy the game because of various holes in implementation.I wish this game was recalled, fixed and re-released - because ideas are really great.It is so strange that somebody in his righ mind would release game in this condition. $... dolars for unfinished game..."
2,This is not that RPG you've been waiting for...,"Wow, this game has problems. They needed another six months in testing on this one. The big problem is how choppy and headache-inducing the camera is. It is simply way to big a problem to be overlooked. Walking through a town and talking to people will make you cross your eyes in frustration. There is a two-second delay to the buttons you push trying to interact with people, so they walk away while you are attempting to engage them. Going into and out of doors is a real hassle and there are long load times everywhere you turn.Don't these game designers realize that we have all played Halo?Popping out of the game experience to a 30 second load screen everytime you take ten steps just WILL NOT FLY.The animations are bad, the sword-fighting is a lot of bad things but mostly it's just not fun.In fact, that sums up the whole game-- NOT FUN."
4,Become the master of the Caribbean,"Free-form gaming... probably the best thing ever invented. Fire upon pirates, fire upon the French, and become Commodore of an Armada worthy of the Queen. Hire smugglers, hire officers, buy and sell weapons, and become an assassin, trader or pirate."
2,Not worth the money,"I gave this game 2 stars based purely on the graphics. Visually, this game is striking. However, the controls are anti-intuitive and overly complex. The sailing aspect is insane. First, I couldn't find where I was going, then I ended up in some random cove and sank for no apparent reason. I had not hit anything, there was no one else there. Basically, the game is too complicated and confusing to be any fun. I have returned my copy."
4,PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN,"This is a very fun game that will keep you playing for hours on end if you do some exploring, take on some side missions, etc. I did run into the ""bad disk error"" bug twice and it made me start all over, but I think I have it figured out by now. When you save, just save to a brand new spot each time as opposed to overwriting a previous save. Do this until you get the message that all of your save boxes are full, then you can go back to the forst several saves and delete them to create more space. I have no idea if this method has any effect other than just pure luck, but I have not had any disk problems since I started doing this."
1,Nice graphics.,"(PC Version)I've played a lot of video games in my lifetime and I can assure you that this is by far one of the worst games I have ever played. This RPG/adventure game has unbelievably complicated controls and no way to switch to a gamepad. Learning to walk is hard enough, much less learning to fight and sail too. Add to that actually having to interact with townspeople and manage your ship's cargo and condition...it's not worth my time. These games are supposed to fun."
1,"Ahhhh, the suckiness...","The ride was awesome, the movie was awesome, this game is honestly the worst Xbox game I've ever played. It doesn't even have anything to do with the movie or the ride, they just took an old russian computer game that nobody knew about and renamed it. A cheap attempt to earn an extra buck by fooling people with the movie's success. Some people seem to have liked it, but I have no idea why. You do whatever you want though, just don't say I didn't warn you."
4,Beat the LOADING PROBLEM!,"There seems to be a lot of people having problem with the loading saved games. To overcome this problem you have to avoid overwriting saved games. Instead you have to save a new game every time. Loading one of these files which hasn't been overwritten is not a problem. So simply save new games and delete the old ones, don't overwrite.Defiantly in my top five favorite games."
3,"Mostly RP, annoying and confusing for a kid under 14","not for kids, also theres nothing about the movie or the movie characters in it."
2,typical movie game,"this game falls into the stereotype of a movie game, it's not that good. the gameplay is very confusing, which distracts from the quality of the characters and the storyline."
1,Cloudy Liquid and Faulty Wax,"I bought this lava lamp and upon delivery the ""Clear"" liquid was more like the color and transparency of whole milk. So even if the wax bubbles had floated correctly (which they did not) I wouldn't have been able to see anything other than dark shadows moving through the liquid. I contacted the seller and they sent a replacement for free and said they would inspect it before shipping it to me...when the replacement arrived it had the same problem as the first one. The seller then refunded my money."
1,No glow,I bought this for my nephews for xmas and it never worked. They live in NC so I couldn't do anything to get a new one because I had taken it out of the box and they had set it up at their house. Needless to say....disappointed!
4,My son feels like a king,"I've had my Alpha Omega for a couple of months now and all I can say is that our son, Vegas, feels like a king in his fancy new seat. It's cushy on his cute little butt and the straps fit nice and snug, adjusting easily if he is wearing bulkier clothes. It went into the car pretty easily and it's a cinch to get him in and out.I would recommend families that have a two door car, not rush into a rear-facing convertible seat. It's nearly impossible to get your child in and out. Stick to the snap out infant seat as long as you can. In a two door car, the convertible seats in the rear-facing position are frustrating, we found. Just something to consider."
2,optional cup holder,"I absolutely thought that I loved this car seat, and in many ways I still do. Recently, my son got his finger stuck in the square hole for the optional cup holder. The holder does not stay in the slot provided. It fell off and my 8mos old son had placed his finger in the hole. He did not begin crying until I tried to remove him from his seat only to discover his finger was lodged in the hole. It took the skin off of his finger and it took four of us, one of which was an emt, to get his finger from the hole. His finger had swollen to atleast double the size. I was just grateful that the finger wasn't broken."
2,Daughter hates this seat,"My seven month old daughter quickly outgrew her Graco Snugride seat and so we purchased this seat for her. She is a big girl for her age. Weighing 25 lbs, and chunky legs. With that said, the harness clips pinch her legs if not carefully placing her in...if your in a rush (what mother isn't) you can cause a bruise. Asides from that once placed in the clip at her crotch area digs into her legs. So for any big baby...this is not the seat! Thats the first issue. Second is being that she is only 7 months we installed rear facing. The box and salesman said we would be able to use the latch system...not so. We need to use the seatbelt and very difficult to install correctly. All in all once installed and baby placed she just didn't seem to be safe in the seat. I would give up comfort for safety, but this seat just didn't accomplish either. Maybe because of her size, so now we have purchased the Britax Marathon, hopefully this seat will be better."
5,Some more information for those trying to decide,"Please check out the following web site. It is the National Highway Transportation's ratings of child safety seats. I hope this helps with your decision making.http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/CPS/CSSRating/Index.cfmThis one rated well for use as a rear facing and a forward facing seat, but it did not rate well for use as a booster seat."
4,Love it but watch out when you buckle up your baby!!!,"I love this seat because of not only the safety ratings, but also because it's LIGHT!!!!! My daughter loves it too, but in the few weeks that she's had it, I've clipped her little legs twice now when buckling her up...Ouch! SO, be careful --- the bottom buckle could be a little longer, but otherwise, my daughter still likes her new seat."
4,monkeymers,"This is the third Alpha Omega seat we have purchased. After shopping for carseats a lot over the last 5 years, Alpha Omega always out purforms the best in safety and comfort. Our seven month old is now over 20lbs, so we had to move into a large seat. The seat is very soft, yet the padding supports her well. When she falls asleep during car trips, her head doesn't flop to one side or another, the sholder belt pads keep her head steady. It is easy to get her in and out, so easy she usually sleeps through it!My one complaint I have is when trying to use the LATCH system. The instructions weren't very clear on how to thread the LATCH belt in and around the seat for use in rear facing. When I went to install it in our '05 Sienna, it took me about 45 minutes to get it tight. The belts just didn't seem to want to tighten all the way. But this is the rear facing way, maybe it will be easier once I flip it arround and use it forward facing."
4,great seat,"I have had this seat for awhile now and it is wonderful. My son's head is supported when he falls asleep unlike my daughter's seat. I just wanted to comment on the review about using the LATCH system. I was worried when I read ""wrap around the seat"" you DO NOT wrap the LATCH belt around the seat. You put the LATCH belt through the same holes as you would if using the seat belt. Note this puts the strap under the child's legs when in the rear facing postion. When using it forward facing you use the same path as you would the selt belt again. I hope this will help you when installing your seat."
1,Boring...,"""Frostwing"" was published in russian few weeks ago in ""Dark City"" series where excellent novels about Anita Blake (by Laurell Hamilton) are now published as well. I was very impressed by Hamilton' books so I have bought ""Frostwing"" which title is changed to ""Master Of Rats"" for some reasons. But I simply couldn't finish the book. It was too boring, the plot is quite thrilling, but it's written in such unimpressive way, that I threw it away by the middle of novel."
2,Leaves lint and streaks,"Yet again, I though I found something decent to wipe my Apple Cinema Display. I've been through so many of these ineffective silly things. The individual packaging for each wipe retains the moisture in the wipes as opposed to the ones that come in a plastic tub, which inevitable dry out. These wipes seem good at first but on subsequent examination it leaves lint on the display and streaks. I tried wiping evenly and very carefully, still no good, same thing. I wish someone would invent something decent that does the job."
3,Not good,"Scratchy material. and doesn't clean well, but probably that's just how wipes are but I'm not giving a good review they sucked, I bought large spray cleaner with a towel, it's not as convenient but works great and blows these wipes away. If you hear of good wipes let me know."
5,Simply the Best,"I actually met a member of the band on a scuba live aboard and he gave me the CD. Little did I know what I gift I had just received. The music is fantastic. Energetic, lyrical, and full of life. It's a shame this isn't more popular - I can only believe that for lack of knowledge a masterpiece is being overlooked by the masses. If you are reading this review try to get a copy of this recording. You won't get mine!"
5,Excellent Documentary,"This program focuses on the daily trials and tribulations of ""the President of the World"", UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. This film is particularly interesting because it follows Annan working with international leaders after September 11. Regardless of your political views, you will appreciate the hard work and tenacity of this leader and the interesting political situations he works in."
5,Something different but Lots Of Fun!!!,this game was another we played with all adults and had tons of fun...however when you order this in the mini set think about buying the score sheets too...so that you don't have to worry if you are scoring right.
4,FUN ! FUN !! FUN !!!,Let's face it -- this is an hidden gem of a little fun game. It fits in your pocket. You dont have to build a large cabinet to hold it. And it's inexpensive.
4,Farkel Dice Game,"This is a fun game. I had never seen it before but my adult daughter came to visit and said, ""Oh yea, Farkel, we played that for drinks when I was in school"". Young grandsons didn't know that . It was fun to play. My only gripe is that the pad and the game were sent separately and the postage was tooo much."
5,great game,My friend brought this game along on a trip to South Africa and I can't tell you how much fun we had with it. We had everyone playing with us and laughing and talking. We were almost too busy playing to eat!
3,"Okay, but not what was expected.","This reference guide definitely has a lot of JavaScript references, however the code description is lacking some details that I think would be helpful, especially to those who really need a reference guide, I of course am referring to those who are new to JavaScript. For those more experienced it may be a little better understood, but if you already know that much I doubt you refer to a pocket reference all that much. A little more description on the next edition would be helpful guys."
3,printing error,"The copy I have contained printing errors. the first 66 pages was the beginning section to ""vi editor pocket reference"" then it picks up on page 73 with what seems to be the rest of the javascript pocket reference.I'm new to javascript and programming in general.. and took me couple of days of trying to understand it before someone pointed out to me that i was trying to make sence of the wrong content.This is the first time I have seen errors of this sort from a major publisher.thanks o'reilly, for wasting hours out of my life."
3,"Decent reference, but missing valuable info","While I like this reference as a whole, I find it a bit lacking for info that programmers really need. While working with Javascript just today, I found myself struggling because of this book ... it does not indicate whether a returned value from a class property is a string, integer or even a OBJECT!I found myself trying to perform a ""replace"" operation on an OBJECT because this book didn't tell me that it returned an OBJECT!I know it's a little nit-picking and, yes, while someone who has coded in Javascript forever might already know this, for those of us who understand programming and are just looking for a reference book to use its classes, this book is lacking of some important information.I just hope New Riders comes out with a Javascript reference -- as a Lotus Domino developer, I find their Essential Reference book perfect and invaluable!"
2,"If you've already got the ""Definitive Guide"", skip this","I was hoping and expecting that this little book would be the same quick-and-easy reference book that e.g. the ""VBScript Pocket Reference"" is -- I was sadly disappointed.Since ""JavaScript: The Definitive Guide"" is by the same author and publisher, I also expected this book to be a (somewhat) boiled-down version of the very thorough JavaScript Reference from that much larger book. I was even more disappointed there.In a ""pocket reference"" such as this I want and need nothing more or less than an alphabetical listing of the JavaScript universe. However, this book is divided into numerous chapters that require you to already know what category the thing you seek belongs to. Since there's no index in these little books, it is useless to me as someone who's still learning this stuff. I've set my copy aside and use the ""Definitive Guide"" exclusively."
2,*sigh*,This book paled in comparision to the first Deutermann book I read-- Official Privilege. It was pretty disappointing. End of story.
3,very good condition,"The book is in a very good condition but didn't come with the CD#1. Anyway, I have asked why, and the seller answered quickly explaining that they ship out items whether they have CD's or not. As written in the description when you purchased the item it says, ""this item may or may not contain codes, cds, etc."" I was overtime so I didn't return it."
4,An practical book!,"This book has three parts: the vowel, intonation, and consonent. I like the middle one most. That's the content which teaches me how to adjust my pitch and accent to sound like an American. The book has a lot of pronounciation exercises. It's really worthy."
3,Follow the ants in the field,"Deborah Gordon gives a very simple presentation of her scientific experiments with ants. It is almost as if we were there in the field with her team. They try to understand how the interacting ants of a colony can display a global ""intelligent"" behavior without any manager. It is a fascinating question. Not being familiar with current research on ants, I was a little bit disappointed however that D. Gordon's book deals almost exclusively with her own experiments. But that doesn't diminish its merits."
2,All Work and No Play....,"A book that reads like a thesis is never any fun. Ants at Work takes an interesting premise(Ant colonies are not run with any central organization but on a series of interactions within the society) and then proceeds to suck all the life out of it! Filled with graphs and the mind-numbing detail about how the experiments were laid out, Gordon describes a process that was as painful to read as it was to perform. The science seems valid and for that I commend the author, but where's the wit to lighten the burden of all this research. With few illustrations to break up the monotony, this book will be a bore for all but the most studious of entomologists."
1,"full of promise, but ultimately dull","The subject matter is fascinating, but I found this (rather slim) book very dry and dull. As another reviewer noted, it's not really a book about ants or ant society in general; it's the story of Prof. Gordon's research into one particular *kind* of ant, told in the first person.A brief web search turned up more interesting information in a minute or two than I found in the whole of the book; Sorry, but don't waste your money."
3,shred lives.,"shred lord joe stump gives some excersises for building shred chops. high production value video but for those that have seen other stump instructionals this will seem a bit lacking in material. its done in an interview style format. not bad but not as jam packed as stumps other vids. this should be seen as an intro to the shred style. fans of stump will want it, but will expect more content."
3,Chop Builder,"I felt this DVD could have been much better. It demonstrated a technique, such as tremolo picking, but didn't really give much advice on how to build speed. It featured an etude that included sweep picking, but didn't bother to explain the mechanics of it. I think your money would be better spent on John Petrucci's Rock Discipline DVD."
5,Very good irons,I use these irons to desolder capacitors. One on each side of a surface mount capacitor and they easily are removed. Cheaper irons have tips that are too large and they will not hit the capacitors very well. This makes a good clean job out of a task that is otherwise difficult and messy. The temperature is good for the lead free solder as well. It melts the lead free solder quickly and without disturbing the area around the components being removed.
5,Weller makes the best soldering irons for the money.,"O bought this unit because of the pencil tip for soldering some extremely thin (42 AWG) copper wire. It has worked great and the unit is very comfortable to hold. It is very light so ""touch"" is the key to producing desired results.I do wish it had a light but it is not all that hard to set up a desk lamp for viewing the immediate work area.I definitely recommend this unit, especially for dealing with small wire into small openings."
4,Good tool,Got lots of use out of it. Sufficient and does the job. I was able to fix electronics and jewelry.
4,Good Insight into Life of an Umpire,"The is a good book if you are curious about the inside life of a MLB umpire. Dave Phillips was truly a great American League umpire during his tenure, and it was pretty cool to read about his daily routine separating his family and umpiring life."
2,A big disappointment,"Poorly written. Can't believe he can remember all the details of games he worked over 30 years ago. Co-author has done similar books, and all are about the same caliber."
4,Good value for the money,"Gave it only 4 stars since didn't get a chance yet to test it out in rainy weather. Nevertheless, it's very spacious, seems well constructed, great value for the money compared to the more expensive brands out there, where you'd pay more than double the price!"
3,Make Sure to Pull it Nice & Tight,"I bought this tent when I was in the Montana Conservation Corps. I carried it on several long backpacking trips. It is a very nice tent, high quality materials, but there are two things that I wish I'd have known before ordering it.The first is that the tent is not free standing. You have to stake the tent to the ground at five points for it to stand upright. You also have to stake the fly. It's hard to set up at night or on a tough surface because it's not free standing. Make sure to buy plenty of replacement stakes, because with this tent, you'll need 'em.The second is that if you don't stake the fly tight enough, it has a flat surface on the top where water can pool and drip into the tent during the night, getting your down sleeping bag nice and wet for the 5 days ahead of you. When you stake the fly very very tightly, this can be avoided.Beyond that, It is very lightweight and roomy for its weight, I'd reccomend it if you know what you're getting into."
5,The New Australian Parakeet Handbook,"This was one of the very few books that covered to any degree the rare species of bird that I recently purchased.I have also seen this title in a highly respected local bird farm library.Highly recommended for not extensive information on each breed, but short summaries on about every breed of Australian parakeet you need to know about."
1,Poor Durability,"I first received this ball and within a day it went flat. So I sent it back and Amazon sent me another one, this time it lasted a couple of weeks and the ball is now tearing away from the inflation rubber and now will not hold air. Nice ball but poor durability."
1,Not so much...,"This ""mini-booklet"" is basically a reiteration of the stages of grief set within a Judeo-Christian perspective. One could probably stop by the local funeral parlor and pick up a free pamphlet that would be every bit as edifying.Good grief, what a disappointment!"
5,Good Resource!,"Through the years of ministry, I've used this book on numerous occasions to assist persons who are making their way in grief. When it comes to experiencing grief for the first time especially, we find that we are strangers in a foreign land. ""Good Grief"" provides a kind of gentle ""map"" so that people do not feel so alone and disoriented. They are always grateful in the days and years after the event for this resource and I am happy to have provided it."
5,Excellent,This is an excellent book. I have been using it for years in ministering to those dealing with loss. I highly recommend it.
5,Quick and helpful guide for a grieving person.,"I first read this book after I loss a father figure. I went to the bookstore and chose the thinnest book I could find because I needed help quickly. It was a great help because it guided me to know what feelings I would be experiencing, and I remember thinking ""I'm not going crazy afterall."" Since I first read it, I've given it to someone else. Yesterday I stood with a friend as she went to be with the Lord. I think I could use this book again. So, I'm ordering two. One for me, and one to lend.If you are having a difficult time dealing with grief, this book will help you understand your feelings -- only God can help deal with them. Together, I found them a good combination."
2,Not for everyone ...,"If you come from a non traditional or Earth based tradition, this is not for you. Very Biased. No lessons in this book are from nature all are from belief systems. Nature's lessons which teach the sacard cycles for example ... the seed returning to the earth after the plant dies teaching us the returning and transforming cycles of life in this realm; are not included. Everything was very god based. If this works for you ... great:) but not everyone wants to be or needs to be faith driven."
4,A classic of its type,"While this book has been in print for many, many years, its basic message is true today. The premise predates many of the more well-known writers, e.g. Kubler-Ross, and thus was ground-breaking for its time. It's simply written and easily read -- perhaps makes many of us out here mourning a great loss feel we're normal when the pain doesn't leave as quickly as we'd hoped."
3,Grief Book,This book is a book that discusses the stages of grief. I have read three books about this topic. This one is not the best but it is okay on the topic. This one lists that there are ten stages of grief but there are basicly five stages of grief that a person goes though.
2,Cheap Recording!,"If you are a big fan of some of these horror films, like I am, do not buy it! They are not the original themes. But if you don't mind the cheap sounds and just want something simple, buy it. I guarantee it wont scare your trick or treaters this halloween. It almost sounds like a downloaded midi file, which are not very good quality sound. If you don't mind the poor version of these famous themes, god be with you because all horror patrons won't."
2,"Not original, don't want it","Like a few of the other comments, I was looking for the original theme music. This one is not. A previous comment mentioned ""The History of Horror"". That is what you're looking for. I just purchased it. Thanks for the tip."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Let the buyer beware. If you are looking for quality recordings of your favorite horror movies themes, keep looking. Although the original artist are given credit for the music on the back cover, the actual recordings are from some hack in a garage with a synthesiser. This collection is in no way acurate to the original movie themes. In other words, this cd sucks.One good use might be at a public hautned house or trails and played at high volume. It would probably keep away any unwanted animals and insects. Come to think of it, the cd would probably keep away the customers. Ok, so there is no good use."
1,This c.d should be melted!,I bought this c.d. hoping it would be good for my party because all of my fav. movies are on there. Thank god I played it for myself first. The theme to Jaws is horrible. It is completly distorted. Just listen to the sample. If you want to really hear what it sounds like type in a search for spielberg themes. Now listen to that sample. That is what it should be. PLEASE DON'T IGNORE THIS MESSAGE!
4,Pretty extensive collection of halloween music,"I am a big fan of horror movies and Halloween. Drew's compilation is well-chosen, with a few exceptions: Poltergeist, Exorcist II: The Heretic, Friday the 13th (where's the sh sh, ha ha theme?).He should have included more from The Shining."
4,Good,Este es un buen libr de Maria Gripe pero tiene uno mejor que se llama Agnes Cecila que tambien trata de un tema parecido solo que mas detallado y mejor.
3,More Danny please,"I enjoyed this. But it could have been better. First of all, the camera work was terrible. The producer must not be a musician. Often the camera would focus on things I was not interested in. I do not need to see a close up of Danny's nose when he is playing. I also do not need to only see Danny's picking hand. And I do not need to see Tom when Danny is playing a solo.Speaking of Tom. The guy is very good, but I got the feeling this was his show with Danny as a ""special guest"". I often got the feeling Danny was just about to take off when it was time for Tom to play again. Danny didn't even play a solo on one song.It could have been better."
3,"Great performance, lousy DVD mastering","The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 5 is because the company who mastered this to DVD apparently did a lousy job. The audio trails the video by about a full second which kind of gets annoying after a while. I went out and got a second copy and it had the exact same problem so I'm assuming they're all like this. (I didn't feel like going out and buying them all as there's seems to be only a couple of copies in my area) Dan, Tom and the rest of the band plays great. They have a geat selection of material covering many different styles of music for which Danny was known for. I couldn't find any imformation on the manufacturer on the cover, so if anybody out there knows how to get in contact with them, I'd like to know because I'd love to get a clean copy of this."
2,not a very good quality of sound,This one introduced a lot of hummm on the line - like a super bass. I could not get rid of that. Product was either defective or not what I expected it to do. I went for a bluetooth one then after - which was good.
4,Mack Bolan Takes Out the Bad Guys...Again,"Line of Control is the 91st book of the Mack Bolan Series and the first book of the Frontier Wars Trilogy by Don Pendleton. In this book, the Chinese triads have decided to try and take over the drug trade across the Mexico border from the Mexican mafia. Bolan has to deal with potential traitors in the Drug Enforcement Agency and triads with tons of firepower. I think in this book, Bolan must take out 75 bad guys!"
4,excellent! Yet not for under-age,"I fell in love with this book and i am obsessed with D.K's artwork! But i must admit that one or two art pieces were kinda shocking to be put in. Mainly on page 50 done by MAXX, although i love the rest of his work. It wasn't that i was grossed out by it though, it just means that it seemed completely different then all his other works put in there. Then again, it might just be me.This book is positively incredible! If it sold for 30 bucks i would still have bought it! For someone like myself who aspires to work in the animation field it helps with ideas, work, and overall is just fun to look at every time.It contains artwork of every area truly! Pop-art, Realism, Anime (of course), and mixes of everything else! Even if someone did not like anime/manga/manhwa/manhua one would still love the greatness of the art itself. It shines a brighter light on how hard and diverse the asian arts can be nowadays."
4,must have,"This book is awesome, if you are a fan of manga or Japanese anime art styles this is must have book. There are many great artist in the book that show their work process. Being able to see how these artist work was great. I definately recommend this book for any fan of Japanese art and especially to artist."
3,ehh,"It's good if you're intrested at just a quick look into other asian manga. But i would recommend other books. It has good pictures, very detailed. But because the styles are very similar it's better to get just Manga or just Manhua."
5,COMIC ARTISTS-ASIA Review,"I gave it five stars because I just love manga, as many people do. I have lots of books on the subject, but what I really liked about this one was the varied drawings of different artists. It really gives you a big idea about how manga is structured. You have a certain way of drawing things and people, but you're free in the way you draw them. Different styles of the same things; it really is amazing. I enjoyed Comic Artists- Asia, and continue to enjoy it every time I read it again!"
5,Walking with Pride,"This story is so moving. Showing hardships, love, and finding acceptance.It tells of an Afician child learning about his history and walking tall as a man. It was very moving, the pictures were soft and had a texture of warmth. I would highly recommend it for reading."
2,Warning: You may go crazy,"First off, let me start out by saying that this bootcamp series does work. I used it for about 2 weeks and saw great results..BUT and this is a but B-U-T, I started going insane by his voice. He doesn't really teach the moves...he is too busy talking and motivating that he often loses count so you wind up doing a whole lot more than on the other side. You just want to scream, ""Oh SHUT UP AND GET ON WITH IT!"" He just talk, talks, and talks...I swear I don't think he even stopped for one second. I would even have to put he dvd on pause so I could even out my muscle workouts. This dvd looks like it was quickly made. I was very disappointed."
2,Irritated.,"I'll start off with what I liked about Ultimate Bootcamp. Billy Blanks conducted a good workout. Also, the music was an improvement over the other Tae Bo I have. The bad news is that one of the people in his video overshadows the music & Billy Blanks. She looked good (Shelly) but screamed/screeched loudly throughout the video. Not only was it extremely irritating, she was given a MICROPHONE! Sometimes music can help take the edge off exercising which would've been of course preferred along w/Billy Blanks instruction. But, since they gave the woman a microphone the irritating screaming and screeching overshadowed the music and Billy Blanks. The video is hard enough but to have the screaming screech irritation made it impossible for me to keep the sound on. And, that makes it tough because Billy Blanks instruction is needed. It's weird how one screeching negative can adversely affect the positive."
1,RELEASE 2010,"I mean REALLY!!!!! Who is going to buy something now, only to get it several years later. Who are they KIDDING???? Sounds like a SERIOUS SCAM to me."
4,great workout!,this is a great workout and its already been released. I do not know if it is a typo that it says 2010 or what but its a great package and very advanced workout. The band are a little hard on the shoulder joints though. I have to take breaks myself or else ouch! Other than that its a very challenging workout. Try it!
1,Undependable,"This seemed like a great monitor at first. Suddenly after only five months or so of use (5-6 hours per day) I noticed a blurry spot in the screen which began to grow. Adjustments, degaussing, and testing on other computers didn't solve the problem. My old Acer monitor of 5 years is now clearer than the NEC.Regardless of the warranty, repair means shipping off the monitor which causes costly downtime for a small business owner. I lose enough money in the downtime to buy half a dozen or more of these monitors. I expect hardware to last longer than a few months, especially NEC's since it's often costlier than other brands."
1,Forewarned!,"This system is a terrible disappointment due to one reason, The housing for the speakers rattles terribly at any volume level with the bass boost/subwoofer on. It actually gets to be louder than the music that you are listening too. It is INCREDIBLY irritating, I suggest you avoid it, it seems to be a huge manufacturing defect."
4,Great product for price,Got this for our black lab for camping in the desert since we can't see her at night. After a while sometimes the connection can be a little loose & flicker a bit but can't complain for $2.99! Bought more in other colors for stocking stuffers for family & friends with large dogs. Have had it for about 8 months now & still use it on night time walks.
3,I am rating in the middle,"because I have not listened to the whole CD. I just heard the song-- Asokan Farewell, and it blew me away.I don't know how the other songs will sound but if Ashokan Farewell is any indication of how Mr. Augustine plays the piano, I am sold. It was a very moving, passionate piece and I look forward to hearing more of his music."
1,The cover arrived ripped...thanks Amazon.,The cover of this book arrived ripped. There is a spot in the cover (where you can see the man and woman through) and someone laid the book in the box so the cover ripped and bent where this spot was. Great.
5,BEST CHRISTIAN ROMANCE GENRE AUTHOR TO APPEAR!,"I couldn't put this one down! Just like HEARTS IN BLOOM (Mrs. Nunn's other great book!) I loved it. The characters are real. Their relationship with God is apparant and their love for others and each other too. The thing I enjoy most about Mrs. Nunn's writings is the realism which flows through the stories. Nothing seems ""phony"" or ""forced."" I read this one in two days as I did her other. Like I said, I just couldn't stop reading! I cannot wait for the rest of Mrs. Nunn's upcoming novels to follow in this series of TEXAS TREASURES! Try them both and you will agree!"
1,Not a children's bible!!,"Okay, this was really a NKJV bible with a cute cover on it. I expected this to be filled with bible stories that can be read to a baby. I returned it for a real children's bible with easy dialogue that could be read to my niece and colorful pictures to capture her attention."
3,Baby's 1st Bible,This is the best baby Bible that I have found in print right now. It has lots of pages in the front to record special events. I would have preferred the illustrations be more colorful and eye catching for a baby. I also would have preferred the version of the Bible be one that uses more up to date language so that the words are more kid friendly.
4,A Decent Interpretation,A very good novel in it's own right since it is based on the awesome movie of the same title. There are some details that were included in the original script that didn't make it into the movie so that should appeal to anyone interested in learning more about the 'Verse
2,NOT as good as the screenplay.,"Don't read this, the movie is much better. The author tries too hard and adds backstory that doesn't fit. I'd much rather have Joss tell me the story than some guy I don't know."
2,Mediocre novelization of disappointing movie,"My name is YT and I'm a Firefly fan. Most of what disappointed me about the movie was audio-visual so, I expected to like the novelization better. I did not. The best part about the story (indeed, the best part about most of the stories in the original series) is the characters. And apparently, the best part about the characters is the way the actors bring them alive, make them real, make us care.Movie tie-in novelizations tend to be written in a hurry, to a hard deadline, so it is perhaps not reasonable to expect great language. But the addition of narration and visual description only served to slow down this story, without enrichening it in the slightest.Not recommended."
3,Strange reflections on a masterpiece,"Need to emphasize that I LOVE the Serenity/Firefly 'verse. One of the biggest tragedies of modern television is how a unique, fresh and special series got cancelled by Fox, and then (in my opinion) the movie gets launched with an unfounded belief that underground ""buzz"" would launch this movie to huge sales. So, with that said - what I didn't like about this book was the author's interpretations on how the characters on Firefly think and are perceived. For example, in the book everyone hates Jayne. But, being a fan, I don't think it's that straight-forward. Like this, there's something or the other that I just don't believe was Whedon's intent when he created the characters. All in all, this is a pretty good movie novelization, with great detail and nice job relating incidents in the movie with the TV series. But, really should have been co-written with Josh Whedon to be 5 stars."
1,A terrible translation from screen to page,"How does one go about taking a fast-paced, character-driven story and turning it into a barely readable work that almost requires a mental four-wheel-drive setting to slog through?I'm not exactly sure, either, but it seems that Keith R.A. DeCandido has mastered the technique. This novelization of Joss Whedon's Serenity falls far, far short of expectations. The characterization is poorly done, and becomes lost in DeCandido's attempts to cram every possible reference to Firefly around Whedon's brilliant script. It's like he obtained a copy of the script and spent an afternoon writing actions around the dialogue, all the while trying to emulate the tone of Whedon's script and get in the occasional ""Look! I know Firefly!"" or ""See? I can be as clever as Whedon, too!"" A good novelization should balance out the script with appropriate actions, not compete with it every step of the way.I also recommend the Visual Companion instead of the novelization."
2,Mediocre adaptation,"There's some good parts in here - I grew rather fond of the ""verse-ish"" language the author used here and there. On the whole though you're not getting you won't find the deleted scenes of the DVDs of the either the series or the movie. A couple paragraphs of backstory on Mr. Universe, maybe a line here or there... some of which was likely cut from the screenplay for a darn good reason.The author's treatment of River was poor, as already noticed.. a very flat ""bored schoolgirl"" indeed. The blatant rip off from the old Trek movie's ""created her own language without 'To be' which worked great until she translated 'Hamlet'"" was just agonizing.Putting the Operative on Haven was worse.All in all.. if you must have ""everything firefly"" to get another glimpse it's okay.. but the suggestion of ""just get the Visual Companion"" is a good one."
2,Not worth it,"Simply, a book that does not feel any need to provide any visual description of the characters or their setting is not worth reading. This one doesn't - it's simply a mechanical fleshing out of the screenplay. I feel cheated."
3,See the Movie First!,"The best thing about this book is the description of the Battle of Serenity. It is not just a rehash of the TV episode. It gives additional insight into Mal became who he is.My advice is: see the movie, read the book, and then see the movie again.Oh, and be sure to get the Official Visual Companion because it is much better than this book."
4,Good for a novelization,"Not usually a fan of adaptations but, I enjoyed the movie a great deal and I've read some other stuff by K. DeCandido that I enjoyed so, I gave this a chance. While it's not up to the detail and depth of a novel it does help flesh out some from the movie. DeCandido loves the old show Firefly and it shows as there are quite a few references back to it and if your a fan like me you get a little extra out of this that other readers may miss.Late in the book he tends to get pretty redundant with some descriptions.I mean, how many times can Zoe give that ""fill-in-blank"" look. This gets pretty annoying after a few times and I couldn't help thinking Decandido was rushing while writing and didn't proof read or the editor failed to do so. I gave it 4 stars but, after further review it'll have to drop to 3 stars."
2,A letdown,"It's hard to say exactly where this novelization goes wrong, as a feeling of 'wrongness' permeates the bulk of the novel. There are good parts that stand out, but only because the rest of the writing feels sub-standard.Ironically, part of this is due to what could arguably be one of the novel's pros. DeCandido obviously did his research, as the book is filled with an impressive ammount of references to the TV series. However, this also serves to intensify the problem that there's little inovation in the story. The characters feel two-dimensional, the narrative feels like a copy and paste effort of the movie. Granted, there are events that we don't see on the big screen, but there's a noticable lack of innovation. It was as if guidelines were applied from the start that couldn't be deviated from.The book can be read without seeing the movie and vice-versa. But given the similarity between the two, they don't really complement each other."
3,Not much insight beyond the movie,"I bought this book hoping to get more than just a quick retelling of the script but more insight into the characters and plot. There are a few of these moments, but not really much beyond what you see in the movie (and the Firefly series - which is awesome by the way).Firefly - The Complete Series"
1,Unreadable,"To say that this book reads like fan-fiction would be insulting to the better fan-fiction authors. The frequent inserts of TV episode references serve little purpose beyond showing that the author has watched the series as well as the movie.Save your money, buy the movie when it is released on DVD, and until then just read the screenplay."
1,This book is unreadable,"It was written in an afternoon by someone with no writing talent. Then it was edited by someone with no editing talent. With all the great TV sci-fi novel writers out there, why the publisher hired this one is a mystery. The dialogue's the same as the movie, which is a much better experience. I'm a Firefly junkie, but I still couldn't read this whole novel. I hope someone writes novelizations of the TV series, but they should be longer and of better quality."
4,good background,I was hooked on Firefly right from the begining and this is a very good prequil and answeres some of the background questions
1,I can't believe this was published,"I want to know who gave the greenlight to publish this adaption as it currently is. Was it the same people that canceled the series? Must be.I love the Firefly & Serenity movie, but this adaption of the movie is just plain bad. It will not motivate anyone to see the movie...and that is a hangin' offense to Browncoats.The dialog is pulled almost word-for-word from the script, but the stuff between is stiff and awkward to read. I haven't knowingly read any other adaptions by DeCandido. If I have, they *must* be better than this.How does one break into this adaption-writin' industry? I know I could do better than this."
2,It's not bad for a novelization written in two weeks.,"On one hand, it's an okay rendition of the movie as a novel; the author wasn't given a whole lot of time to write it. On the other hand, DeCandido wrote much of the text using the verbalisms common of the characters, i.e., western-style syntax and generally bad English. While that's fine for dialogue, the rest of the book comes off as amateurish and somewhat forced. If you're a die-hard browncoat you'll probably want to purchase this, but if you're not a fan of _Firefly_ you might want to pass on this novel."
2,Bad Adaptation of Great Material,"DeCandido tries to write his narrative in the same folksy style Whedon wrote his dialog in -- and fails miserably. The author's style seems almost schizophrenic at times, ranging from bland, sterile writing to nails-on-chalkboard failed attempts at capturing the same western/folk style Whedon hit so well. The author did a fair job of trying to wrap up the various historical tidbits of the crew's story, but overall the book was a big disappointment."
4,A pretty good novelization of the movie,"SEE THE MOVIE FIRST.SEE THE MOVIE FIRST.SEE THE MOVIE FIRST.I can't repeat this enough. The book is a good representation of the movie, but the movie is a world better. The novelization here was written from the shooting script of the movie, using descriptions of characters that won't match up when you see this on the big screen, but overall, the story itself is the same and is a solid book. The writing does come off a bit flat, when compared to the movie, and there is a lot of extemperaneous description, but that is necessary for people finding the book and having not seen the movie, nor the series."
5,Enhanced my movie experience,This is a must read for any Serenity / Firefly fan. I would not suggest reading the book prior to seeing the move BUT reading the book after seeing the movie just added more detail to an already wonderful experience.
5,awsome book!!,"Okay, I thought this is one of there best books! I really like Mel since she's so determined in this one and I think her and Image are perfect for each other! But where are all the other books about Image after this one????? I think any Thoroughbred series reader will REALLY enjoy this one!!"
5,Really really awesome!!!,Racing Image was a great book. I've always liked Melanie the best out of all the thoroughbred characters. She trains and races Image and when everything looks like it's fallen apart everything comes back together again. There's also little blurbs about Star and Christina which will eventually lead up to another book about Christina but the next two books are about Cindy. Cindy's Desert Adventure and Cindy's Bold Start I think. So for all the people who were missing her (not me she's kind of a jerk) she's coming back. This is a great book I'm sure anyone who likes horse racing will enyoy this book thoroughly.P.S HORSES RULE!
4,Something's Changed,"I'm not sure what happened to the books. I still like to read them but something isn't right. They used to captivate the reader now there just same thing. you know what's going to happen before it does. I don't like it. Joanna kept the reader's interest. And I'm think Karen Bently did too. The new righters are good but they don't fill the empty space. With Image, there in real life, would be no possible way for her to win the Kentucky Derby. As for Wonder's Star everyone must have known that he would win the Belmont Stakes.You at book #24 shifted it from racing to jumping. We didn't want that. Even though you put racing back those books were a wast of time. You need to get the spark back in. The books will be good, but not great. As far as I know there will only be one writer for the books, Joanna Cambell."
1,this book was disgusting,"i don't know what happened to these books, but they are a waste of money. lately they all have the same boring and pathetic theme. firstly, usually image, is the most perfect, fastest horse in the world. then some minor incident happens and melanie cries, thinking it is impossible to train the horse and gives up. then her perfect cousin christina tells her not to give up so melanie tries again. the characters are pathetic, winey brats. when mel's dad buys image, she expects it to be a gift to her. that is completely unrealistic. he did the best he could and mel blew him off. i disliked this book very much. you are no longer in touch w/ the characters or even the horses. personally, i don't even care if image or star ever races again. the horses and people have no characteristics that make them likable, unless you like spoiled brats like mel and christina. the authors need to develop the characters and horses better if they want to keep selling books."
3,Interesting read but could have been better...,The novel lacks pace and the new characters are uninteresting. Also regret that all the grown ups in the story (aside from the city's triumvirate) are just stupid sheeps who don't even try to look around them...
3,Wasn't as good as the first book.,I really liked the first book. Which might be embarassing to admit since I am in my 30s. This book was too young and boring so I couldn't continue in the series.
1,What happened?Reviwer: Margaret Mclean,What happened to all the excitement and fun. All this book has is boring farm life.
4,Not as good as 1st book,"I was very interested in this series after reading City of Ember. I was very eager to see what befell the city of Ember. Like the first book, this was a page turner as well. The story itself wasn't as good. Basically, the Embrites emerge from the underground and begin looking for other people. They happen upon the City of Sparks and seek to start a new life. They are taken in and given 6 months (during the winter months) to stay and learn how to live on the upside. Tensions rise as the people of Sparks have to now share everything with the Embrites. A new word, WAR is introduced. Due to the actions of a child being mad, a war is started.The book hits themes about right and wrong. It was a good read, not what I really expected. Excellent series for young and old. Can't wait to read the next book."
5,creative and also uncomfortably realistic,"I'll let the kids' reviews decide how good this book is for its target audience. But it definitely spoke to issues I'm wrestling with as a middle-aged mother, living in a neighborhood that is struggling with sudden racial and economic changes. Sentiments expressed by the people of Ember and of Sparks sounded uncomfortably familiar--not just from my immediate situation but from far more infamous parts of the world and of history. I think the author has done a great job of addressing multiple issues of nonviolence in a creative setting that portrays human nature very realistically. Nonviolent problem solving is so much more complex than ""make love not war."" This book recognizes that and gives some sobering food for thought."
3,Slightly disapointing...,"""The People of Sparks"" ~ Jeanne DuPrauThis book was the sequel to ""The City of Ember,"" a book that I reviewed exceptionally favorably. This book...well, I was disappointed. Not to say that it wasn't good, it was just...different than the first I suppose.I will not be putting in a synopsis of the book as I did the last one because of the extreme possibility of spoilers. That being said, I just felt that this book moved slower than the first. I was not on the edge of my seat the way I was with the first, and therefore, the book lost a lot of its spark (no pun intended).The overall message of the book was phenomenal: ""Make love not war,"" and considering the audience it was written for (pre-teens) it is exceptionally deep and thought-provoking with many incidents leading up to the final conflict that make the reader stop and think.The bottom line is...it was ok. I expected more after the first book however.Three stars."
5,Dont wast your time this book is on your mind,THIS BOOK IS A GREAT BOOK TO READ IN MY OPINION.I SAY THIS BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU GOT TO THE END OF A CHAPTER YOU WOULD WONT TO KEEP READING ON AND ON.IT WAS LIKE SURPRISE SURPRISE.SEE AT FIRST YOU THOUGHT THIS BOOK WOULD TAKE FOREVER. BUT WHEN YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ONE OF THE CHARICTERS YOU JUST WHANTED TO READ ON NON STOP.THIS BOOK CAN REMIND YOU OF YOUR SELF CAUSE OF SOME OF THE CHARICTERS.SO IF YOU EVER WHANT TO READ A BOOK THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU.
4,Great Middle Grade Listen...,"In this version we are in the City of Sparks. I won't tell you where that is or how we get here. I enjoyed the first book better than the this one but this one is still good. Again the narrator is awesome, but some of the voices that she uses for the new characters are bit annoying i.e. Tick). I'd say the first half of the book moved too slow for me, even in a short audio, but the second half more than made up for it. I really found myself constantly switching sides and I think the issues expressed are difficult ones. I love the message of this story and found it very telling of human nature. I think this is a great discussion book for middle grades."
3,Good for age 9 - 12,"The story of the City of Ember continues. The residents of Ember have left their dying underground city and come to the surface to a new world. They are provided temporary assistance by the people of Sparks, but sparks soon begin to fly as resources and patience dwindle. It's up to our young heros to help the two communities overcome the growing suspicions and anger, in order to create a new people. A lovely book for 9 - 12 year olds."
3,Three and a Half stars,"This book is the sequel to City of Ember and talks about how they finally escape the dying city of Ember that they only knew about. It was not a bad book, but it is definitely more for young adults. It talks about how Lina and Doon are trying to save the Emberites in this new village that they come across and how to not make the same mistakes the people in the past of made (War/fighting) and teaches values, as does City of Ember and Prophet of Yonwood.Overall, it was good, I just wanted the meat and the potatoes to learn what happens to the people! I finally learned :)"
3,another great book from the ember sieries going down hill,this was also a great book from the ember seiries. but i would also like to know about the disaster it was like jeanne didnt even put thought into the disaster like she just made the name and a little information about a war. I want informtion about what happend. and i have also read all of the ember books and i agree that they go downhill from ember.
5,Great book series for pre-teens and teens.,Bought this book for my 9 year old granddaughter's Kindle. Her older brother read the printed books series and loved them all. Both kids enjoy reading and especially like reading on their Kindles. This story keeps the reader engaged and anxious to read the next chapter.
3,Not As Good As I Was Told,"I never wanted to read this book my class is reading it. First of all, after reading the first book, I thought that the sequel would be better. To my dissapointment, the conflict was boring. Usually, I like my books to be funny or exciting but this book was the complete opposite. The only parts I did like was tjat there was a character to hate because of the actions they take. Of course I hated Torren. H is a little prick that craves attention. Who wastes other people's food and then blames it on somebody?? I would not know anybody so mad to meet an Emberite and then take them in. I do like how the concept of war is taken and explained in this book to the clueless Emberites. I also find it funny how the Sparks people think of the Emberites as annoying because of their cluelessness. I give this book 3 stars."
4,People of Sparks,"After reading The City of Ember, I waited with anticipation to read The People of Sparks. While I enjoyed the story, I was a little disappointed by the quality of writing. I felt there were parts that were incredibly profound regarding hate and violence, how they begin and where they lead. At other times though I found the writing to be mediocre. I still liked the book overall and felt that the message regarding solving problems was excellent. I will happily recommend this book to my class of fifth graders."
2,First was MUCH better,"while the first book was GREAT, and I was anxiously looking forward to the sequel, it did not live up to the first book. Everything is very predictable, and the plot drags on. It was hard to get through, even though I finished the first book in less than a day."
4,can the people of sparks save the people of ember?,Mrs.Murdo found the note that Doon and Lina dropped from above.Then she had the very difficult task of explaining the instructions to the city of Ember. When they discovered this every thing went wrong.As soon as they reached the surface they began to whoop with joy. but they had to walk many miles to reach the settlement closest to them. but when they learned that they are only allowed to stay for 6 months and they only had that long learn to farm raise animals and make shelters. But if you think that every thing was peaceful then you're wrong.If you liked the city ember then this is definitely worth reading.
4,"Isn't it just pleasent when human nature gets in the way, again?","I found this sequel to be okay. Alot of the parts are just talking and no action, and some parts are a bit boring. But otherwise, it was a pretty good book. Not on my list of favorites, but definetly worth reading. Very well written. I found myself wanting to hollar at the people for being so stupidly selfish (human nature getting in the way...again.) I found myself wondering why they didn't discuss their options in the very begining, but then it wouldn't have been a very good story if everything was all happy cheery. The book was a very satifiying sequel. I wasn't left wondering like I am with many other sequels. If you liked the first book, then read this sequel. You don't get left with too many questions at the end and it is a quick read."
4,A solid sequel,"This book is a solid sequel to The City of Ember, though the ideas were a bit less ingeniously original and, I'm a bit sad to say, just a bit too preachy. The City of Ember is a real masterpiece, and can be enjoyed by any age of reader, but I felt this book was, indeed, for kids. Still, the characters were real and the situations engaging. If you read The City of Ember, you need to read this book, and you'll enjoy it."
4,Basically as good as the first,I got this book for christmas and by the end of the day I had finished it. I really enjoyed it!! After reading the first chapter I was confused but after the next few I was hooked!! The only problem was it was kinda predictable. But I still enjoyed it! I would give this book 4 and a half stars. It was definatly worth buying and reading though!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,awful,"If you are looking for a book for a ten-year-old, then keep looking. The quality of writing is very low, and the story has no imagination at all. For heaven's sake don't read the next one in the series; it's even worse! Instead, look for books such as ""Cold River"", Harry Potter, or the Twilight series."
1,Boring!,"I hated it! Really, really boring! I liked The City of Ember, and wanted to see what happened next. But I really wish I hadn't read it. I only recommend reading this book to people who love wasting their time."
4,"Good Book, not like the first one","This is the second offering in the books of EMBER. In this one we find the people of Ember finally emerging from their dying and beloved underground city. They have followed the instructions left by Lina and Doon. Now they join the people of the town of Sparks. Friction between the two groups starts right from the begining. Not enough food, the people of Ember have no idea of surviving in this new and strange world, where the sky is blue and there is no end in the horizon. Lina now learns about the DISASTER when travelling to a deserted and destroyed city.As I mentioned, this is in fact a good and great read. Nevertheless if compared to the first book ""City of Ember"" it lacks. The People of Sparks it's written almost like a lecture. There are no plots, no surprises. The book is a good read because the Author manages to keep the story interesting. I'm really looking forward for the next book of Ember. I hope the magic and the thrill are back.Cheers."
3,Slow,"Compared to the first book, this one was way to slow and drawn out. Plus, the premise wasn't nearly as neat."
3,People of Sparks,"Not as good as first book, slow going. I thought the first book was much better and kept me interested."
5,Fantastic book!,"I loved the first book, the city of ember so I decided to read the second, And it was magnificent! I loved this book because I just loved how the plot moved along and it didn't go on and on about one specific subject for a while. I can't wait to read the third book!"
3,People of Sparks,"I've had this book on my kindle for a long time. It took me a long time to finish it.There wasn't much action in this book, and it wasn't as interesting as the previous book. I hope the next books will be better and easier to get through."
5,The story of Sparks,"The People of Sparks is a really good book. It is the sequel to City of Ember, and it is about Doon and Lina, who are trying to survive in the new (to them) village of Sparks. They endure hardships (mainly starving), teasing, and...threats. They realize after several times where they had been hurt, threatened, or their homes had been vandalized, that the Sparks people simply did not want them. Together, Doon and Lina have to save their family and friends. Again. Join them as they find bravery where they thought was nothing, and make their new home safe again."
3,Ok. Not as magical as city of ember...,"This was a good book, but not great. I felt like it was shoving the fable down my throat. Almost too moralistic in the story telling. I loved the city of ember and the magic it spun, but this book was too ""real"" and not enough magic/whimsy.I also think that Lina and Doon's character was in question in this book. The first set them up to be so interesting and this book their characters were rather lack luster. It also lacked the spirit of adventure that the City of Ember had. It didn't keep me guessing.I know this book is for children, but I think kids may lose interest since it's not very suspenseful or adventurous."
1,Great Concept-Poor Execution,"Don't get me wrong, the idea of taking a list of the greatest movies and then writing a series of books detailing the movie and its impact is a fascinating idea. The book by Anton Kaes on ""M"" is a stellar example of how the movie and book compliment each other. But here, in another Fritz Lang film the idea is torture. I could never get what the author was trying to say, he rambled on and on and never got to a point. It is neither a book of film criticism, nor a book on the times depected, nor quite frankly of anything else. I love Metropolis, I have seen it many times, in both the Moreder version and the incomplete silent versions. It is a masterpiece, this book is not. Watch and read M instead."
2,This is not up to Sony's Standards,"This cd plaer skips all the time even with esp2 on. it just totally sucks when it becomes continuous with the skipping. Skip skip skip skip skip, that's all it does, even with brand new cd's."
