2,Silly would have been an improvement...,"I had such hopes for this game. Since it was for a baby shower, I thought I should buy two so we could have a competition. Tried out one of the catapults to determine how we could make a game out of these and quickly became discouraged. The ""babies"" to be catapulted were too small and flew too quickly, therefore they disappeared when shot. The back side of the package is decorated to be used as a target board, but it's way too small and after opening the package, a bit useless. Besides, how will one know where it landed after the ""baby"" bounces off the cardboard? Granted, I probably could have used something sticky on the cardboard to make the babies stick, if so, but it truly was too small. Silly would have been an improvement for this game. And the price, way too much for so little. Will I put this one in the garage sale pile? Good chance."
4,"Intro to Zen, History of Quilting","This was an interesting look at the emotions, history, and personal stories in quilting. Inspirational: I'm ready to start projects of my own now."
4,Zen and the Art of Quilting,Another Christmas present read before Christmas! This is perfect for the travelling Quilter to while away a plane trip.
4,next,"I enjoyed crossing the waters so much, I couldnt wait to hear this recording.It's good but not as good as his last. I think he could of benifited from a little more focus. This effort is all over the board musicly. Nice but it detracts from the effort. Its cracked my collection but not my faverites."
5,Great active pants.,"I thoroughly enjoy these pants. I've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities. These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I've been through - including 5.11, Woolrich, etc. I think the best feature on these pants - which isn't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side (for me, the strong side). This pocket, placed directly behind the front pocket (and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer's) has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached. The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size, such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis. My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over. These are great."
3,"Hard questions, confusing presentation","This small paperback book of trivia is chockfull of points of minutiae about baseball, hockey, football, college sports, and other sports. The book is so packed with information it's hard to access. The type is extremely small, and the design so busy it almost makes you not want to read it.The questions are hard, really hard in fact. I don't think they're even that interesting. It's not a test of sports knowledge to know on what day a sports event happened, or what various teams' won-lost records were. What's more interesting in sports is who did what, how many did they get, and why was it special.I'd look elsewhere for a sports trivia book."
2,Sounds like a school orchestra.,"I'm lucky, i paid 1$ for this CD in a 1 dollar store. It's bizarre to hear cheap synthetisers and conventional battery in an album with Orchestra in the title."
5,Great addition to my gas grill and or smoker,Highly recommended for outdoor grilling enthusiasts. Greatly expands the utility of a grill for cooking breakfast and other items that do not lend themselves to open flame cooking.
3,Should not have rushed,"I really wanted this for a BBQ and its great, I should have waited on buying it because I actually found it for a whole lot less a day after I used it. Bad price great product."
1,Rusted and Ruined,"This is not stainless steel. It can't be. At first I thought it worked great, even though it discolored and couldn't be cleaned enough to restore the original look, but after a few uses, It started to get rusty, even without obvious moisture EVER left on the surface. Not blackened or stained, but flat out rusted. Now, without ever using it again, and keeping it stored in fully enclosed, completely protected cabinet in its accompanying bag (put away dry), we opened it this season to find it COVERED with rust and totally unusable. Lots of money for a 4-5 use item."
3,griddle,i bought this item for the grill to cook certain foods like veggies and some meats. the quality seemed to be good and it arrived on time. but when I tried to use it on my grill i could not keep the heat up high enough to finish things off. I ended up having to finish on the stove. I don't know if I was doing something wrong or if it was the product. I will do more research and try again.
5,Sizzle Q SQ180,"I bought the Sizzle Q early this summer,Love it. It works really well, I have BBQ everything on it,Bacon,Eggs,Tomato, Mushrooms.The steaks are always cooked to perfection and my grill stays clean.The Sizzle Q is easy to clean, just scrape off the top then wipe with kitchen roll.One of the best buys I have made,well worth the money"
4,Portable restaurant flat iron griddle,"Very nice stainless flat top grill for outdoors. We use when RV'ing and cook outside the travel trailer, on our two burner camp chef portable stove.Probably works better on a gas grille, as another reviewer mentioned, with the longer tube or bow tie burner shape. We too discovered the heat is concentrated in the center of our portable stove matching the burner shape. If using on a camp stove, be sure to get a heat diffuser (plate with small holes) to diffuse the heat more evenly under the griddle.Make sure when cleaning that you DON'T EVER use a steel wool (brillo style) pad on stainless steel. It leaves little pieces of regular carbon steel behind that will penetrate small surface crevices and rust. Scotchbrite pads work well on cleaning. I find that while still hot, squirt it with a water spray bottle and get things sizzinling and scrape, wipe repeat a couple of times to clean up."
5,camping,"I was kind of worried about buying this because of reviews about rust. Let's lay this to rest. I have used this camping several times, coat cooking surface with a little Olive Oil, no sticking did a wonderful job with eggs, bacon, & home fries, without anything falling over the sides. We love it I'm sure you will be getting many orders because a lot of people loved it, that we camp with. I felt like a salesmen.It has it's down's also, I ended up cooking for 15 people after seeing it in action. It cleaned up wonderful, & fairly easy,using soap pads & no rust, just dry with a towel.It's lucky I like cooking. Can't say enough about this product. Camping in Ct."
5,excellent discussion - complex topic,"this books is a good way for us laymen to begin to understand the many complex viewpoints surrounding the state of Israel.I am not very politcal, but this helped me to understand alot more about a country where there is alot of history, alot of emotion, and MANY view points.Lori"
4,"Warm, honeyed voice","Cesaria Evora does some of her finest work here. Those who are familiar with her other recordings will recognize the minor-key modes and yearning quality typical of her style. The instrumental arrangements are intimate, not overwhelming, and always complement her inimitable voice. That said, after purchasing three of her CDs, I feel that I've exhausted this repertoire -- there is quite a bit of melodic and harmonic similarity among them -- and don't feel inclined to own a library of her work. For those who are new to Ms. Evora, this recording would provide a lovely introduction and summation of her art."
5,Words Cannot Describe the Beauty of Evora's Soul,"As a musician who has performed with, listen to and seen many of the class acts, I regret deeply that I never had the opportunity to have seen and heard Cesaria Evora in person. The voice, and earthy soul she gives her songs are like the cozy warmth of a fire-place and candles."
5,fabulous,"Originally heard the single ""Miss Perfumado"" on an anthology disk of international divas, and I bought it just for this one cut. And I am equally thrilled with an entire album of Evora. Torchy songs, Brazilian beat; could be sitting in a Parisan caberet filled with cigarette smoke and enjoying."
4,Reviewing Landslide,"I've been looking for this cd (record) for 40 years. Features Curtis Counce (of the Philadelphia Counces) on bass, Jack Sheldon on trumpet, Harold Land on tenor sax, and, as I remember, Gerald Wiggins on piano, and Frank Butler on drums. It includes some of Sheldon's best playing before he became a television clown, especially on Sonar, which Sid Mark used to use as a theme song for his all night, Philadelphia radio show (my personal introduction to jazz at age 14). Everyone else plays wonderfully too, no doubt, but as a trumpet player myself, Sheldon speaks loudest, at his peak, in his funky Bill Hardeman/Don Cherry kind of sound. Nothing totally ground-breaking here, just straight ahead 50s jazz, but a very fine example of the genre."
5,THE COUNT,"curtis counce was a excellent bass player, solid,but not a hard hitting walker like paul chambers,but held his own. Harold land is one of jazz all time best tenors ,great music here,peace."
3,Calidad y sus implicaciones,Un buen analisis de los elementos necearios para la calidad y losistemas ISO
2,El Cheapo Collection in Every Way!,"This Best Of can't be recommended, even at the dirt cheap price.Sonically, it gets a 1 star and sounds like about a 5th generation dub. In addition, the mastering is so poor, that there are noticable db fluctuations between certain songs!Also, there are NO liner notes whatsoever.You'd be much better served by popping 2 more bucks for the 20th Century Masters Collection which has much better sound, some liner info, and a better song selection."
3,Cowsills - 'Best Of The.....' (Rebound),"True life version of the TV family the Partridge Family.Only The Cowsills,were of course 'real' performers.They existed as such from 1966-71.Showing many just how much fun harmless sunshine pop can be.I realize the term 'sunshine pop' sounds really lame,but the Cowsills were actually pretty hip for their time,anyway.There's(or WAS)Bill,John,Barry,Paul,Bob,little sister Susan and mom Barbara(R.I.P.).Tunes that I remember always being a pleasure to listen to are here on this CD compilation like ""The Rain,The Park And Other Things"",""Meet Me At The Wishing Well"",""Gray Sunny Day"" and the unforgetable ""Hair""(my favorite).I remember playing the 45 single until I literally worn the record out.Should for sure appeal to fans of Mamas&Papas,Association,the Osmonds,Tommy Roe and Bobby Sherman."
3,Four cool songs but....,"The Rain,the Park and Other Things is one of my favorites from the 60's. It's a classic! Indian Lake, We Can Fly, and Hair are also very good. The rest range from forgettable to embarrasing. Still a great buy from the band that inspired The Partridge Family!"
3,spp,"I was sort of disappointed in this CD. Though the songs we heard often on the radio were just as good, the rest of the songs are pretty bad!"
2,One good song,"Everyone seems to know a song by the name of The Flower Girl. No one seems to know that it is really called The Rain, The Park and Other Things or that its by The Cowsills. This made it difficult to track down when I decided I wanted a copy after being reminded of its existence one evening.It was on the strength of this 5 star song that I have given the album as a whole any stars at all. If you are hoping to find other gems here, forget it. The rest of the album (except perhaps Hair) is woeful."
5,"Poetry of courage, candor, humor and human understanding.","The poetry collected in the late Charles Bukowski's What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through The Fire takes the reader into the mind and imagination of a keen observer of the human condition. The courage, candor, humor, and human understanding of Bukowski's poetry blends to create a kind of intuitive contact and an innate wisdom that will engage the intellect as well as the emotions of the reader. Full Moon: red flowers of love/cut at the stem/passion has its own/way/and hatred too./the curtain blows open/and the sky is black/out there tonight./across the way/a man and a woman/standing up against a darkened/wall,/the red moon/whirls,/a mouse runs along/the windowsill/changing colors./I am alone in torn levis/and a white sweat shirt,/she's with her man now/in the shadow of that wall/and as he enters her/I draw upon my/cigarette."
2,"Readable, but not Memorable","Extremely shallow plot about a privileged, ditzy, bisexual female that lucks through life and even has a ""magic talent"" of being lucky. Takes skill to pull off. Larry Niven comes to mind (See the Ringworld trilogy). Unfortunately, there are Bethesda Softworks sized plot holes throughout the entire book.I do have to applaud the ability for the author to paint a picture though. The descriptions of a ruined New York were ... interesting to say the least."
4,Face To Face's third album; an unknown treasure,"Face to Face made a splash with the hit ""10-9-8."" Their second and third albums never made much of an impact on the charts and as a result, their label dropped them. Which is a huge pity because ""One Big Day"" was probably the band's strongest work.There is a strong country influence throughout these catchy pop tunes. This was a pretty significant departure from their previous recordings, which were more conventional 80s rock with a strong dance beat. ""One Big Day"" broke that mold and is much more like some of the performers of the 90's, like Amanda Marshall or the Bottle Rockets.The opening tune, ""Forever As You,"" is one of my favorite songs. ""I Believe In You"" is probably the best song on the album.Laurie Sargent still occasionally performs in the Boston area and I try to catch her appearances whenever I can."
3,Good Book,"Won't put a great on this one... It's ok, but does nothave a lot of detail. Was hoping for more I guess."
5,Great value!,"Bought this for our 23 lb. 12 month old. We use it for hikes of up to 5 miles. Easy to transfer between Mom and Dad- love the easy switch in torso length. Comfortable. Little one fell asleep during one hike. Great value. Small, easy to pack in the car with the rest of the camping gear."
3,alanis morrisette clone,If you like alanis morrisette a lot then you might want to check this out. otherwise pass.
2,great fanny bad zipper,I liked the style and size of the fanny pack. I like the comfort of a leather waist strap over the cloth straps on the other fanny packs I have used in the past. Compartments are of good size and number. The zipper on the main compartment broke after only a couple months of use. It is a shame that a good quality pack is ruined by a poor quality zipper
1,Zippers are all breaking,"The main zipper split open over and over again, so I bought a zipper at a fabric shop and had it replaced by a shoe repairman. Now the back pocket zipper has split. The bag could last for a good while but the zippers are totally cheap. I would give this bag no stars. It was a waste of money and a major source of irritation."
5,Based And The Photographs Of Naval Vessels,""".....The information on which this book is BASED AND THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF NAVAL VESSELS have come in large part from the Navy Department itself.....""[from the book of the introduction]"
1,Unhappy in Memphis,"I ordered this cartridge and it showed to be new. I expected about 15,000 copies on this cartridge and didn't even get 500 copies! Now 30 days later I am having to replace it with another cartridge. I am giving them one star for getting the right order but the cartridge was not good and did not last anytime."
5,Sharp copier toner,"I know that by using Amazon, I will be ""guaranteed"" professional products, and providers who are reputable. I trust that products will be excellent. This toner was exactly what I ordered. Thanks."
5,nice book for self study,"I have been using this book for advanced independent study- and I just love it! The concepts are explained pretty clearly, and the organization is great!"
4,Good selections of both songs and artists,"Go back to the earlier 90's, when a lot of people had decided that much of the melody and clever lyrics that left rock had turned up in country. I'm sure there are people who could live without hearing ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" ever again, but this is still a nice selection. Shania is singing something that hasn't been played ad nauseum in every supermarket and shopping mall in several countries. In the video for this relatively early effort, she even ceded the starring role - it's actor Charles Durning who's allowed to have the floor - literally. Times have certainly changed!"
4,Too Bad they Split,"It's a shame that The Dolls were dropped from their record company and then, subsequently fell-apart after the release of this LP. Perhaps if they followed David Bowie's lead and toned down their image, songs like ""Stranded In The Jungle"" would have found their rightful place in the top ten. Remember, this was the same period that saw remakes of ""Please Mr. Postman"" and ""Locomotion"" hit the top of the charts. Play ""Puss-n-Boots"" followed by the Sex Pistols ""Liar"" and you will see where Rotten and Co. got a lot of their sound and attitude. Still, despite the fact that there are some less than stellar tunes, this is a great LP and should be a part of your CD collection if you own CDs from other classic punk bands."
5,"If you don't like this, you don't like rock n' roll","I had no clue who the Dolls were at the time I bought this album for 5 bucks in the used cd bin. Wish I had it on vinyl. I was heavily into the Ramones and what influenced me into getting this mainly was the fact that I saw a clip of Joey w/a Dolls T-shirt on. I figured what the hell, I'll give them a try. After the first three chords I was hooked! This is rock and roll. I love it because I can get down with this album, have a lot of fun and feel real about it. Puss and Boots is my favorite."
1,Totally Overated,"Sorry to rain on everyone's happy NY Dolls parade but this band's music really demands some dissenting voices, and this album, being worse than their self-titled debut, makes a fitting place to voice that dissent. Other flattering reviews here mention comparisons with the Stones and Arrowsmith, along with Guns 'N Roses and Chuck Berry; add generous dollops of camp and parody and you start to get the trashy picture. On this album one can already see David Johanson trying on various annoying personas which will culminate in Buster Poindexter. The only redeming factor in this band is Johnny Thunders, and only then when the band is playing his infrequent songs.If you you like punk--more the British and L.A. type than the Ramones and Stooges (both superior to the Dolls) type--I recommend you avoid The NY Dolls. The other reviews on this album and their debut, however, are probably fair given other types of taste. But I still say this is one of the most overrated bands in rock history."
5,Mr Cheap's is a Gem,"This is a great book for tourists and New Yorkers alike who are on a budget. It is filled with valuable information on where to shop, eat, visit, and stay. If only Mr Cheap could tell us how to get the book cheaper!"
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, DEFECTIVE","DEFECTIVE CANS, MANF REFUSES TO EXCHANGE AND IS RUDE. boycott this and buy something for a customer service oriented company instead."
2,Dont waste yoiur money,Very disappointed. The bottle container stop working after on a few sprays. Not worth the time or money to send it back
5,Comprehensive overview of research concerning HR topics.,"This book was required reading for my undergraduate I/O Psych class. Since then, this has become my bible when researching topics having to do with HR and training and development. Every HR person should have this book, or one like it. Would be nice if it were updated soon, but all info still applies."
4,"Brilliant Beginning, Superfluous End","The King in Yellow is one of the most brilliant--and one of the most disappointing--collections of short stories I have ever read. The first five stories were tremendous, transcendent, stunning. I could not look away. The last few stories were woefully disappointing. It is clear to me that they were added solely to fill out a word count. It's disappointing, but it does not diminish the power of those five stories. Pick the book up and read those stories. You will not be disappointed."
2,no king,"well, chambers stories have a LOT of potential. he has quite an imagination. very original guy. and very different. he could have been truly weird. but he doesn't know when to stop. he can suddenly stretch the story too far in one direction, amazingly enogh: away from the horror. also he likes to include romance even when it doesn't fit. he has an anarchic style that destroys the stories."
2,"A fair book, but a terrible edition","The King in Yellow is a typical anthology horror, in that some of the stories work, and some don't. Its generally worth picking up for the better half of its tales, and also one for Lovecraft enthusiasts, as the Yellow Sign has come to be incorporated into the Cthulhu mythos by later writers, and is now featured in the various Cthulhu board and card games, etc.However, this edition leaves something to be desired. Its cheaply printed, and full of typos and formatting errors. I'd recommend finding a better edition before purchasing."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"I had so looked forward to reading this book because of the hype it got from the Lovecraft crowd. It was so boring that I had to take a break from it about halfway through and read something else. A couple of the stories were ""okay"" but too many of them seemed to ramble on-and-on without any real purpose or climax. Even the descriptive prose left a lot to be desired. I have read some excellent horror and dark fantasy by authors from that same era so it's not like that Victorian style of writing bothers me, yet, I am amazed that Chambers was so highly touted.I must be missing something but I'll be damned if I can figure out what!"
3,Tales within tales,"4 different stories together in one volume. Writing style is enjoyable.1. Men gather round a hunting table and tell ghost stories. None are terribly frightening, but well written and some suspense.2. An aspiring author's anecdotes of a life with a variety of experiences. Okay writing, not terribly engaging.3. Travelers in Italy along a road plagued by robbers. Tales within tales about the lives of robbers.4. Pirates and treasure! Stories about treasure hunters searching for booty left behind by pirates."
4,Fun and lighthearted sabotage,"This book is hilarious. I've read it to tatters because it's the sort of thing you can pick up, open at random, and spend a pleasant time laughing at the characters who are ""slightly off balance yin-and-yangwise but definitely benign"". Naturally organic satire at its finest."
1,This book is useless,"I purchased this book over 90% of the websites mentioned are not any good. No longer available. Stick with your Ace, Afaa program and it gives you all the infor you need. This book was a waste of time."
4,Good Stuff,I have been thinking about becoming a personal trainer and this is a good guide. It really is a great reference point that will help get you to where you need quickly. Very cool even though it says for dummies. LOL
4,Great read for a newbie!,Brought out a lot of interesting points to consider if you are thinking of becoming a personal fitness trainer.
2,book,Although this is a good product. I would recommend other books over this one. It doesn't tell you specifically how to put a program together.
4,Interesting,I would say while reading this book I definitely work out differently and take my training more seriously. Great book for those of us looking to expand on our daily workouts.
1,Damaged,"I was super excited to get this book as a Christmas present for a good friend. She is studying athletic training, and is a certified personal trainer. I got the book 2 days after I ordered it, through the postal services.As I opened the package I took the book out, and it was damaged completely. Whoever put it in the shipping envelope was an idiot. The book is completely bend in several places, and a few pages were ripped.I am not a happy customer right now"
2,not impressed,"This fight video wasn't as good as what i heard. Its a bunch of skin heads getting beat down, I think thats the only good thing about the video(thats the reason for 2 stars). Also there's this nasty WT female on there walking around naked. This DVD is not worth buying!!"
2,"Not ""Remastered""","Reason for the ""2"": The CD I received was not a remastered album like the product description states, rather I was sent an original 1988 AAD recording. Aside for that, the album is a classic. Some of the best L.A. Guns ever."
5,HOLLYWOOD TEASE,"rip roaring debut. la glam rock from 80's. their second cd sold more and is just a little better,but i always liked the rawness of this. sex action, bitch is back, no mercy,electric gypsy and hollywood tease make this worth owning"
2,Aside from a few piano solos this is drek!,"overloaded with soulless synth noise,this score gets it's two stars for the few moody solo piano cues included..One wonders if,in this new century,film-makers now go out of thier way to hire""composers"",like Armstong,who define""music""as being a few computer keyboard taps rather than something written for humans with both talent and real instruments,to actually play?I,for one,long for more John Williams,more James Horner,More James Newton-Howard,guys who write REAL MUSIC!I cannot,for the life of me,imagine why ANYONE would want to sit around FOR ALMOST AN HOUR,and listen to an album of""music""which,aside from a few piano solos,consists mainly of BUZZING COMPUTER SOUNDS ,all sounding very much alike...."
4,A Woman's Review of a Man's Book,After reading this book I now understand why I can't find any good men- they've all been looking in the wrong places. If they read this book they'd have no trouble finding the woman of their dreams.
5,Great Book,"It's a solid, well-structured program. Easy to read, easy to follow, and after trying some of the suggested techniques I'm convinced it really works. The self-paced exercises ensure that you tailor the program to meet what it is you want, rather than just what some ""expert"" thinks you need. The author's sense of humor helps, too."
3,"Thought provoking, entertaining, insightful and humorous.","I found this book thought provoking, entertaining, insightful and humorous."
4,Great so far,"Like many of my friends neither my husband nor I had a will. A will was for our parents, people with lots of money or those in particularly dangerous professions. But with the birth of our son we realised that we needed to figure out who would take care of him in the event that something happened to both of us.Not having a large estate we decided to try out Willmaker Plus and it is great. It has lots of different forms that we don't need as yet but may soon. The will itself is very straight forward and asked lots of great questions that we never even thought of. I showed the final document to my father-in-law, a lawyer, and he says it all looks fine. This has been a relief for both my husband and I.Like I said if you have lots of benefactors and a really complicated estate this is probably not right for you. But if you want a good will that will provide for a child or two then I think this is great."
3,Software review,"Software is adequate in that in follows generalized formats and you can print out your will to get it notarized. The biggest shortcoming is in ""specific bequests"". Due to the confusion from the instructions and the software's lack of allowing me to be specific, I ended up making a separate list of ""who gets what"" and put ""see attached sheet(s)"" in the specific bequests section of the will."
4,Willmaker,The product appears to be informative and reasonably easy to use. It is very helpful just describing the issues that need to be addressed. Provides for addressing some stuff we might rather ignore or avoid.
2,It's a beginning,"Very easy to use, but only effective for very simple wills. If your estate will go to more than one person, it requires a lot of modification not in the software."
1,Not what you think it is. You should see an attorney.,You cound use the internet to get the same information and save the money you pay for this thing!! Never again!!
5,An entertaining and complex book; excellent.,"Seven inter-linked short stories, set in the same fictitious hotel on the quays in Dublin. The stories range from the out-right funny to the somewhat disturbing. The author of each story is not identified, but it is left for the reader to guess (I think I've identified three out of the seven)."
3,A Concept That Doesn't Quite Make It,"After having heard a lot about this book, and read a number of reviews, I read this with much anticipation. I was sadly let down. While there is no denying the qualities of all the writers showcased, that is not to say that we see their best work here.While the linkages between the various stories are cleverly contrived, the writing is uneven. I found ""Room 101 - Benny Does Dublin"" far and away the best of the stories.That is not to say that this is a bad book, just that Bolger as editor hasn't quite pulled the concept off with this effort. Nevertheless, worth a look."
4,Perspective certainly makes a difference,"I enjoyed seeing how Bolger tied these stories together and how the perspectives of the characters differed from the reality. I got the sense that Bolger really enjoyed creating these tales, and I enjoyed going along for the trip."
5,"""Solo"" is a refreshing and absorbing read!","""Solo"" is a refreshing, absorbing read. What makes it so interesting is that all of the excerpts are written by the artists themselves, all brilliant yet human artists whose experiences are lucidly and effectively related throughout the book. As a singer-songwriter myself, it was a pleasure to gather inspiration and encouragement from these women, most of whom have travelled the long and lonely road in search of artistic and spiritual breakthrough. Each entry is very intimate and personal, and I felt like I was having coffee with each artist! The accompanying photographs by Emma Dodge-Hanson are lovely and introspective, showing thoughtful, quiet sides of each dynamic woman that are often ignored in the glossy images of magazines or music videos. I often return to ""Solo"" to draw out words of wisdom from my favorite artists. I can only hope there will be a companion book to follow! *****"
5,An amazing look into the minds of today's female musicians,"Solo:Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words, is an intimate look into the lives and experiences of today's finest female musicians. Unlike other books about rock stars this is not a cheesy interview with repeated questions that you hear all of the time. Each artist speaks uninterrupted and it seems as though you are listening to the artists in person. It is revealing and interesting and for many young female (and male) musicians it is inspiring. The pictures are excellent and expressive adding the perfect touch to this already amazing book. Definitely 5 out of 5 stars! Great work!"
4,ditto for ' collage',"these two reviewers are correct, collage is a great tune with excellent and evocative lyrics and exemplary instrumentation and tasteful , not tacky strings. this is certainly a finer album than the next two james gang cds( rides again and thirds) its more cohesive. although some songs may be a little too lengthy( ie stop and lost woman,) walshs flashy but incredible guitar work is phenomenal. a very impressive first album. the cover of buffalo springfield's bluebird is excellent. the album is even humorous in places. fred is another brilliant track with an explosive wah wah ending that leads into stop. funk 48, not to be confused with the far better known funk 49 from rides again, is extremely catchy and yes, funky.this is a diverse and underappeciated gem of an album that is easily the high point of walsh's career in my opinion."
5,GREAT CD,"I USED TO THINK THAT THE RIDES AGAIN CD WAS THE BEST BY THE JOE WALSH LED JAMES GANG BUT WHEN THEY REMASTERD THE FIRST JAMES GANG CD`S WITH JOE WALSH I BOUGHT THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND NOW I`LL HAVE TO SAY THIS IS A LITTLE BETTER.THIS HAS A GREAT VERSION OF A BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD SONG BLUEBIRD.BUT THE STAND OUT SONG`S ON THIS ARE THE HARD ROCKER I DON`T HAVE THE TIME,AND STOP.THESE TWO SONGS ALONE MAKE THIS A CLASSIC CD.GREAT EARLY 70`S MUSIC."
5,walsh's 1st and best,"Looks like i'm not alone in claiming this one as a contender for a top ten list. Tight..yet loose...jammy..but not boring..and still plenty heavy enough. These guys were firing on all cylinders with this one...and Joe has never topped his guitar work on Yer Album. Jim and Dale provide a tight, complimentary base for Walsh's lengthy guitar histrionics..and the material here is top notch. Worth it for the Gangs rendition of Bluebird alone...and as a former drummer..well..give the drums a listen..good stuff!!"
3,Yer Album James Gang,"James Gang's first compilation which started our love for Funk #s. You may not know Joe from this early time, but prior to Rides Agains his name and popularity was beginning in Cleveland and the Area. As the primary vocal and musical influence of this albumn and other James Gang offerings, Joe only grows from this questionably mixed selection of their writings and several remakes. After their Funk#48, the Gang follows with a Steven Stills song, Bluebird and a Jeff Beck co written, Lost Woman, of which both could have been replaced for another of their own offerings instead. The last song, Stop, origionally done by Soul Singer Howard Tate and written by Jerry Ragovoy, is done fairly well and mixed with a raggity glue up, is a good place to stop."
5,"Hard, Strange, Awesome","A lot more jamming takes place on this album as opposed to its more well-known follow-up. However, the songs are just as strong and memorable. Joe Walsh is immediately the dominant force in the group with great guitar and vocals. While most people know the James Gang for their next few releases, all can do themselves a favor and give Yer' Album a solid listen. They won't regret it."
1,No Online Help,I found this product to be terrible.Antivirus Software must be updated to be useful against the newest viruses.These folks claim to have a website where you can update and buy product but it doesn't exist (www.GuardianPrograms.com).
5,Into the Abyss...,"One of the indispensable reggae albums from the 70s. Not really a bad song on here, but 'Declaration of Rights', 'Satta Massagana', 'Peculiar Number', & ""There is No End"" stand out. So does 'African Race' - love the intro to that song.I've read a few negative critiques about the vocal harmonies in some of the 3-star reviews for the album. I guess I don't hear anything to complain about.If you like Bob Marley, Third World, Burning Spear, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, Jimmy Cliff, or Alpha Blondy, or even early Steel Pulse, then this album is a must have..."
3,GOOD SOUND CULTURAL MUSIC.,THIS IS REAL REGGAE MUSIC....IT IS A VERY GOOD LISTENING CD......HIGHLY RECOMENDED....
3,Overrated?,"This album isn't bad at all. That said, it really isn't anything special, either. The reason I picked it up was because I had been hearing people singing the album's praises. After multiple listens, my general opinion of the album is that it's pretty average. I'd heard specifically about the title track, and was quite disappointed to find it to be totally unremarkable. Peculiar Number is a fantastic song though. I didn't find the horn arrangments to be anything spectacular. The biggest issue I had with this album was actually the vocal harmonies. It sounds like the Abyssinians are being choked while they're singing. It may seem like I'm giving this album a pretty bad review, but I figure that there is plenty of praise in the other reviews that I don't need to repeat. Overall, this album is worth buying, but I feel that it's generally overrated."
5,Roots at its best!,"This is a must have for any reggae fan. Great music, great lyrics. Reggae that came out of this era just seem much more meaningful. No cheesy sythns or fake sounding drum machines. Exactly how reggae should be performed. If you are reading reviews to decided if you should get this CD or not, click ""Add to Cart"" NOW!!"
5,"Great for ""almost sitting"" babies!","This toy affectionately referred to as ""The Donut"" in our house was priceless from about 3 months to 7 months (until our daughter began crawling out of it and onto bigger better things). We partially inflated it at 3 months, and she enjoyed having the support and being able to be more upright....then we slowly inflated it more as she began to learn to sit up. We believe it helped her to sit up sooner, as it was a good exercise for her to ""wobble around"" safely in the middle. It is still in the corner of her room, housing some favorite toys and she still gets a kick out of climbing in and out of it.Definitely a great transition toy for babies just about to sit up and crawl! The only downside is that it definitely has a loud decor, but will grab a babies attention pretty early! If you have a pump, its great to travel with. We took it on many vacations and it was a great thing to have in hotel rooms!"
2,frustrated by construction,"I think the design is a great idea, but was a little frustrated when the poles that hold the top together kept popping out and apart- I had to take it apart and tape them together. Also this is not easy for a newborn to ""nest"" in- they cannot lay completely and are uncomfortable propped up. I will try it again when she's older, but right now it seems like a waste of money"
1,I'm torn!,"I saw this item and just had to have it! I run a daycare so it get a lot of use. There is one BIG PROBLEM...the tubes inside the sleeves never stay inside the attaching tube! I HATE having to fix it at least 2 or 3 times a week. I thought to return it, but it would have been more of a hassle to return it and the children I have in the daycare LOVE it. So I fix the darn thing! I wouldn't recommend getting this product unless you have time to fix it over and over again."
5,The greatest,My 1 month grandson loves all the bright colors and my 2 year grandson thinks it's really cool to sleep in
2,Maybe I'm crazy,"I cannot get this thing to stay together. As soon as I put one bar in, the other bar falls apart. I guess I need superglue? Did anyone else have this problem???"
2,not good for apartment living,We live in nyc and this was a huge toy plus our daughter liked it only for 1 1/2 months. Now at 6 months she wants to dive out the side and land on her head!
3,Alittle expensive for the quality.,"Although it looks nice online, I was disappointed once it was delivered as a gift. I don't thing it's worth the price. It is cheap in it's look and feel. It's going back to the store, $69.99 is too much money for this item."
3,Nice but over priced,"I had this when i lived in the UK with my first born ... it is cheaper there. i would pay the 25-30 pounds for it but not over 60 bucks ... my son did like it but he seemed to slip into it alot or fall to one side so that he would be stuck inside the ring, as they get older they become too big for it and then they cant lay down in it at all, making the gym practically usless because there is not much room for the child to sit up in there without being clonked on the head by a toy every time they turn around, like i said fun for the first months (dont leave your baby in it without supervision), but i wouldnt pay 60 odd bucks for it, by any means."
4,Not worth the money,"My newborn son got this gym for christmas. The picture on the box looks great but pictures don't tell the whole story. This is a good idea for newborns but stills needs work. The poles that hold the toys never stay together. I am forever puting them back together. And what is with the price. I would never spend $[this amount$] for this product. I hope the person who brought this gift got it on sale. I am sure there is some other products on the market, just as good or ever better for a cheaper price."
2,Quality vs. Price,"Although it looks nice online, I was disappointed once it was delivered. I don't thing it's worth the [price] I paid for it. It was cheap in it's look and feel."
4,Takes a little getting used to...,"Though I balked at the outrageous color scheme, this has become quite the asset in our home. My son is now 3 months old, and he truly enjoys his playnest. He will entertain himself laying down for 30-45 minutes. The toys are great, as they are adjustable along the bars. In addition, unlike a lot of other stationary toys, this is super light and easy to move from one place to another.I do want to mention that my son absolutely hated this toy up until now (3 mos.). He would cry almost immediately when I put him in it. I would recommend waiting to buy this until your child is at least 2 1/2-3 months old. (Or if you already have it and are frustrated with your child's reaction, give it a little time) Also, the bars do come detached frequently--but usually only because we have moved it around.Despite my tiny qualms mentioned above, I would definitely recommend this to everyone!"
1,toy bar collapsed,"i would not reccommend this for babies who can reach the toy bar as it is easlily collapsed when the toys are pulled. I did however like the blow up tube, it kept my son from falling over before he could sit safely on his own."
1,not impressed,"We received this as a gift and I have not been impressed. I'm just glad I didn't pay for it. It is impossible to inflate unless you get an automatic air pump. Then, good luck fighting to make it fit inside the sleeve. The worst part is getting the arches to form and stay. My two year old barely taps it and it caves in on her little brother. You form the arches but by the time you get one arch done and begin to work on the other, the first arch falls apart. It is not flexible. The design is insane. It is also very large, so I hope you have ample room because you can't take it down unless you want to struggle with the silly arches and disinflate the thing- trust me, you don't!"
3,TOY WAS NOT WORTH THE MONY,IT WAS GOOD FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT MY DAUGHTER DIDN'T LIKE BEING ON HER BACK SO MUCH BY THE TIME SHE WAS 4 MONTHS OLD SHE COULD ROLL AND THEN JUST OUTGREW IT IT WAS A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO USE SOMTHING SO COSTLY SHE ENJOYED A RED AND WHIT MAT WITH A GYM OVER JUST AS MUCH AND ITLASTED LONGER FOR UNDER 20.00
3,Not so great,"I bought it because it looks [...] but the quality and the design isn't as good.My sun stayed inside when he was 2 and a half now at three and a half he seems already bored,and all the time roll inside the nest.I'll try it again later. I have a fisher Price play mat the one with the birds'house that is really a goog thing."
3,Saphead and Battling Butler,"This feature film, Saphead, is one of the lesser known Keaton movie. In my opinion it is less funny than most of his work. He's a hapless guy who's the butt of everyone's joke. Never the less anything by Buster is wanted."
4,Works as advertised,"This is a good kit for the money. The only drawback to this product is that it comes with only two of each size of dowel centers, which I ended up using often in my desk project. I would rather have used three dowel holes on the shelves, but was limited to two. Nevertheless, the kit is precise and easy to get used to. I did my dowel hole drilling very quickly."
1,Please look elsewhere.,"This is an abysmal piece of cast aluminum that doesn't clamp straight, with drill stops that can't reasonably be squared to the bits themselves. It's just awful.Please. Save yourself. Anything else that does this task has to be better."
1,Returned Immediately,The centerline of the jig does not line up with the centerline of the hole. I returned the kit immediately seeing it was going to cause more problems than it was worth.
4,It worked,"Worked as stated most of the time. Sometimes the hieght would be off about a 32nd of a inch, alinement is cruical. Made very strong joints with some glue, Cant complain though. Will use again."
3,Square corners,This dowel kit had everything I needed to learn how to make good square corners without mitering or dove tailing. used it same day I got it. works good.
1,Out Of Alignment!,"I bought one of these at HD, used it to put together a frame. The pointersare not in line with the drilling holes. No quality control. Would not recommend!"
5,Great info - Great Price,"In the last 3 years tons of books have been written on stock day trading. A few are great, some are just okay and the rest border on useless. To me, the measure of a book is in the author's ability to communicate to me quality trading strategies in a way that I can understand and implement them in my own trading. I believe Toni Turner's book accomplishes this very effectively.I've been day trading equities full-time for a number of years. If I were a newcomer to the markets today, this book would be at the top of the list of recommendations to myself...(I hope that makes sense).I think the book would be most helpful to beginners and folks who have already been trading for up to a year. The text is heavily grounded in technical analysis and includes many chart examples. Great stuff!"
3,A begginer wont trade better with this,"Any one that wants to make it as a trader needs more practical information. This book is good but not good enough. A beginner needs a well defined trading plan and not just a general overview of online trading. You have to take into account that a beginner will compete in the same market as the advanced trader does.Many books that are targeted for beginners distract the reader with a lot of jargon instead of helping the new trader to focus on a simple trading plan.Some sites in the internet offer more especialized information. One of those sites is Profitable Stock Market dotcom.You always have to consider that there are no 100% safe trading systems. But still you can make decent profits by following a simple strategy that is able to generate you consistent positive results, while keeping your trading as simple as possible."
4,necessary first book for day traders,Please read this book BEFORE you start day trading. There are so many pitfalls to this profession that you must be armed with useful tools before you start doing it. It is much to easy to lose everything gradually or rapidly for the beginner. Don't follow her recommendations at your own peril.
5,Don't Start Without It!,"I have been day trading for 18 months. I know that doesn't seem long but in this buisness that can be an eternity. I can't help but wonder how many of the people that I have seen crash and burn, might have made it through those early days if they had read this book. This is a great book for entry level day traders. Turner is a trader who knows how to write about the markets in a clear concise manner, touched with humor. She explains how to trade actively while protecting your capital. Ever new trader should add this book to his or her library!"
5,Excellent Book!,"This book will make a lot of investors HAPPY! The author has really done a good job! I have read many other books, but her book is different, and i am glad i read her book!She starts with the basics of trading and explains everything in detail. She also teaches the basics of candlestick charting which I found very interesting! She also explains how to use many other important indicators.And for the price this book sells, it is a STRONG BUY!"
4,Certainly worth the time and money,"Not being much of a book reader overall, I am VERY skeptical about most books, going in. However, this book has solid information, a minimal amount of fluff and is well written. After thoroughly studying/reading it, I found myself RE-reading a large portion of this book to further review the techniques it outlines. Thats rare! Bottom line, good book. Buy it."
4,This book really helped me get started on the right foot,This book helped me get started in daytrading easily and quickly. This book gave actual hands-on experience of what the author has done. I would recommend this book for anyone who is clueless in the world of daytrading.
1,Nothing Special,"I have read the book. I guess Miss Turner attended the useless course offered by Pristine Daytrading (which I have attended) and came back running to rewrite their manual!!. Can one use the material and make money? .. NO!. She is not a professional trader (if she trades at all!), and therfore you should not expect a lot from this book."
2,Her techniques only work in bull markets,"Try applying Toni Turner's technical analysis techniques in anything but a bull market, and the probability is that you will be burnt... severely.You should do well out of her techniques, when the markets are going up... but you would do well anyway, without needing to use her techniques.For the price, her book is OK value. But by focussing only on technical analysis (very little on level II), your money would be better spent on a book with a larger repertoire of approaches."
4,Recommended reading before you start trading,"Right on to what I wanted to learn more about. Very clear that the author really have the experiences in the market, such that she can point out common serious mistakes to avoid. Whether it can lead us to win from the market ??? I would say it just raise the odds. Worth the $$ paid.Cannot rate higher as the book should be quite out of date, yr. 2000 ??"
3,"GREAT content, POOR illustrations","This book is definitely worth buying. I was not happy with the illustrations, they were of poor quality. The ideas are great, but the delivery is poor at best. Hopefully the publishers will do something about it in the future. Simply put, you can't respect a book that feels cheap in your hands. Unfortunately, it takes away from the author's hard work.I give the author 5 stars and the publishers 1 star. Consequently, (5+1)/2 = 3 Stars."
4,Fire Team Bravo,"This is a great set of stikfas. They have a great selection of modern weapons and it comes with 4 different stikfas. If you don't know stikfas, they are super posable and fun to play with. they are easily the best posable toys out there, though let it be known that they do wear out if played with alot. I liked this set, would recommend, especially for those who are already fans of stikfas."
5,An Excellent Teen Read!!!,"I absolutely loved this book. Not only is the content socially and culturally relevant, but it is presented in a way that reaches teens where they are, as they are and with the respect they deserve. I even found myself marking off pages I found especially insightful! I highly recommend this book for all teens facing the difficult challenges of life today. This book is definitely worth checking out!!!"
2,No so great...,"Two more musicians were added to Monk's quartet here, a trumpet player and a tenor sax player. These two guys don't fit too well, their soloes are kind of lame. The music is nice, though. The two bonus tracks feature very disturbing side noises - two guys talking about something."
4,At the Blackhawk,Great cd in great shape send to me in short time. Almost as good as new they said and that's the truth. I'm happy!
4,Sharpe's Eagle-- best of the bunch.,"I find it amazing that, of the four Sharpe episodes now on DVD, that this one, ""Sharpe's Eagle"" has the lowest sales ranking. I've seen all four, and this is clearly the best of the bunch. It is the second of the 14-part series (parts 5-14 are planned for near-future release)This is the last episode containing the original actors for Wellington and Hogan-- they were both replaced with inferior versions in ""Sharpe's Company"". But this one has it all-- the best script, the best acting, the best plot. Don't miss it.I've seen several baffling complaints about the video quality of these discs. All of my episodes I would rate good to very good here, and certainly well above VHS clarity. Certainly better video mastering has been done...but I have seen far, far worse. Perhaps they show poorly on a low-end DVD player, but my Sony 7700 (as well as my computer DVD drive) play them outstandingly."
5,Sharpe's eagle is the best,"I viewed the whole Sharpe's series, checked out from the local library, and this one was the best, it has little bits of all the best characters, the repartee between Sharpe and Hogan is terrific, as well as the bit where Sharpe has to whip a green regiment into shape, and of course the tender moments between Sharpe and Commandante Teresa. If I could only have one of the videos, this would be the one I would get."
5,Sean Bean before Lord of the Rings & before Game of Thrones,"Sean Bean is one of my favorite actors....and it's not because he was Boramir in Lord of the Rings, it's because he was Richard Sharp in this series. The story is great, it is one of my favorites in the series (Note: I have not read any of the books, just watched the entire series...multiple times). They are awesome. The DVD quaility is 1st rate"
3,Disappointing to fans of the books,"I am a big fan of Bernard Cornwell's series of Sharpe books. While I enjoy these DVDs, they do not measure up to the books. The most disappointing part of these DVDs are the battle scenes. Cornwell's books are centered on the battles. The battle's in these DVDs are small, low budget affairs with about 100 soldiers on each side, not the grand spectacle that is demanded."
3,Weak acting,"The acting was how can I put it, to much like American TV instead of quality British TV. I know they are trying to establish who Sharpe is in a short time, but it had the rushed feeling of an American TV show instead of the deliberate pacing I expect from quality British TV. Overall I found the character development one dimensional and rushed. But having said that I will most likely purchase all of these on Blu-Ray. I love this period of military history and there doesn't appear to be anything better out there."
2,Low Budget - not like the books,"Hi,i was very disappointed by this DVD Series!If you read the books forget the movies.The battles are looking very unrealistic and there areonly around 100 soldiers.The bridge in this movie is a cheap wood bridge, also there is nosecond battle when the bridge after the bridge has beendestroyed.Even the capture of the eagle is a scene of 2 minutes."
4,very challenging but worth it,This paper model contains many details true to the actual chateau. It contains a great historical account of the chateau including the previous owners and very detailed pictures. It can be challenging for beginners and even experienced persons because it contains many tiny precision cuts and folds. It also does not have sufficient instructions as to the construction of the castle. Once completed it is very attractive. It is a very nice addition to a collection and I recommend it. Nice job Alain de Bussac and Paul de Boever.
1,Can't rate it.,"I've ordered this frame three times. Each time i got it the glass was broken and the wood was scratched up from the glass. So I really can't comment on the frame because I have yet to see a complete, undamaged one. If i were you I would be very cautious on what you buy."
4,MUCH cheaper at Maternity & Baby Shopping Mart!!!,"This crib set is so modern! I love it! BUT after doing some research, I found it MUCH MUCH cheaper at Maternity & Baby Shopping Mart.[...]Just trying to save a few extra bucks! Hope this helps!"
2,A self-righteous harangue,"Sinclair was a friend of Jack London's, and like London he churned out work written in a style that manages to be cloyingly folksy and pretentious at the same time. This book is a long harangue about how many people Sinclair has known who died due to alcoholism (including London). Unfortunately it fails to convince anyone because Sinclair is so self-righteous and so boring that he makes cirrhosis of the liver sound preferable to following his advice."
3,a-quire this...if possible!,"never thought i'd see this album again. i'm preordering it in hopes i will actually be able to get it eventually. i owned the lp back in the 80's. you think the manhattan transfer has the market on this type of big band vocalizations? not after hearing this group. wish there was more of their stuff available. for now, thats all...sczki@aol.com 12/09/04"
3,It was okay,I didn't enjoy this Bourne as much as the first one. I am still glad that I purchased it so that i will not be out of the loop when I see the third.
3,Adequate Blu-Ray Transfer,"This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself. The transfer is adequate, with a good level of detail. Black tones are nice and dark. The color saturation is good. There is some film grain visible, but you have to be fairly close to the television in order to see it. From a few feet away, it looks crisp. So while this is not the best blu-ray transfer I have ever seen, it is not the worst either. As to whether or not you should upgrade from DVD, I would say that depends on how well you like this film. If it is one of your favorites, then go ahead and upgrade. But if not, you can probably get by just fine with an upconverted DVD."
3,"The fight scenes...oh, come on!","Let me just say...in spite of what I say here, the movie is a good one.Hey, hold the camera still darn it!! Can't tell what is going on or who's hitting who. I saw The Bourne Identity in the Theater recently. There were a couple of intense fight scenes where the camera effect is just too much. Ok, so it may add some panic or intensity, maybe even some adrenaline rush. The thing is, you can't see what the heck is going on. I want to see the action. This HEAVY juggling of the camera all over the place makes me think they're trying to hide some badly choreographed fighting.The first and second film have interesting story lines to follow. Matt Damon plays well. I don't get the bad acting distraction like, hey this guy is trying to act and failing miserably, like with Ben Affleck.p.s. I don't have the DVD, just saw the film on screen."
4,Action Packed Thiller,"The Bourne Supremacy is a great Action movie. The car crashes and chase scenes are astounding.The cinematography done during the car crashes is just completely amazing and thrilling. If youwant to see great action in a movie, this is the movie to see.Matt Damon is a great action-adventure star. Joan Allen is perfect as the head of the agency out to stop Bourne. Julia Stiles shows what a great actress she is, she is completely believable in a a great role.A fun and adventurous movie that will have you on the edge of your seat."
1,Hold the camera still,"I hated this movie, as did my wife.The movie, the plot, the action were all great. The problem is with the directing and editing.They hardly held the camera still at all, so we both got nearly sick from all the constant motion. We felt as if we had just come off one of those rides at the fair that are designed to make you sick. Even had to close my eyes and/or look away many times. Was very disorienting to watch.As far as other reviews which say the handheld camera was bad during the action scenes, I say it was bad during the whole movie. Hardly ever was a still camera used. Between action scenes when you want to relax and regroup you couldn't because the handheld camera was still being used.I didn't time it, but I bet a still camera couldn't have been used more than 5-10 minutes in the whole movie.Can you imagine being on a tilt-a-whirl for an hour and a half?"
1,hated the camera,"I hated this movie, loved the 1st but hated this one, why? you may ask, here's why: the camera. the camera jumped & jiggled so much during the fights you couldn't tell what was going on, & it's an action movie which you watch for the fighting, right? well if you aren't able to see what happened it's basically just an action movie without action. plus the final fight was a car chase, how stupid is that? I was hoping to see some premium assassin on assassin fighting but instead I get a car chase with horrible camera movement"
4,Good movie - but TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY FROM THE BOOK,"Okay - great movie. I could have done without the shaky-hand cam stuff, but all in all, pretty good. Fight scenes, stunts, and so on - all on par with the first move.Thats said, I read the actual book over the summer. Totally different story. In the book, Bourne is in Hong Kong frantically hunting an assassin who is impersonating him in an effort to save his wife who has been taken hostage by the CIA. In the movie, he's in Berlin randomly kicking ass and taking names and hunting the CIA for, he believes, killing his wife. WTF? Where did the second story come from? Am I missing something?Still a good flick - just shocked. On the bright side, I was anticipating a night of critiquing the film based on poor portrayal of the book....instead, I saw a whole new story."
4,"When in Moscow, learn the language.","For a thriller that centres around a Russian-oil-tycoon connection and plays up the attention to detail that is required for any successful operation, it is surprising that the producers allowed for actors who are supposed to be Russian, to speak in a funny accent and in an incorrect and stilted way. While this kind of goofiness shows up in the previous Bourne movie, as the funny gibberish on the close up of Bourne's Russian passport, this time, as the location moves to Moscow, such sloppy Hollywood work is unacceptable. This oversight adds a fresh political insult that perhaps was not intended - that ""Russian"" oil-tycoons are realy just foreign plants. A daring political statement!"
1,Students: Don't write a book review based on the movie...,"Yes, I really did like the movie. Fast paced and Matt Damon did a good job of continuing the 'creation' of the 'movie' Bourne. But I have never liked the fact that movies vary a lot from their original books. In this case there isn't a similarity. It's almost sad. There is nothing in the movie that resembles the book - it's totally different. So much so that the Ludlum estate should demand that Damon's picture be taken off of the present release of the book, and maybe even demand that the name of the movie be changed. To say that this is the story written so masterfully by Robert Ludlum is a gross misrepresentation... (And the book is MUCH better)."
3,Could have been done better,"Action packed sequel, that overall is enjoyable, but the story could have been told better. In this one Bourne has lost his memory and is being pursued by assasins while being framed for murder at the same time. Usual espionage stuff like double agents and car chase scenes that would have been musch better if the director knew how to tell a story. Matt Damon did a good job, if you like him check it out."
2,not as good as the original,"The same pieces are there and even the plot makes a little bit more sense than the plot in the original Bourne movie, but somehow it fails to click."
2,Hated the Cinematography,"I love the plot of the Bourne Supremacy, I love the characters, but the action scenes showed NOTHING. Every fight and chase scene was nothing but a blur and sound effects. Yes, these things are blurry, hurried situations, but one of the things I loved about the Bourne Identity was the fact that Jason Bourne had the ability to take a step back, asses the situation and make clear decisions.I wanted to see the fight scenes. I wanted to watch the car chases. So, basically, I loved and hated this movie."
1,Was there an Earthquake during Shooting or what?,"Gets my vote for ""WORST"" cinematography since ""Man on Fire"" with Denzel Washington. The camera work was so jumpy, and the editing so choppy, that it made me motion sick. Given my druthers, instead of ""One Star"", I would rate it with ""5 upchucks""."
3,The Bourne Steadicam,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT movie! While the movie departs further from the book, the story is top-notch with the right touch of human element and motivation.However, the camerawork is absolutely, drop-dead painful to watch. I hate watching a movie where I can't guess what is going on because there's a flurry of ""somethings"" across the screen while I'm reaching for the Dramamine. You can almost hear a collective sigh of relief from an entire movie audience when the hyperactive cameraman stops jostling about - presumably because he's throwing up off screen.It's such a pity, too, because I do like the story. It's worth watching just for that -- hopefully, the camerawork on a TV screen is not as painful an experience."
4,Bourne Supremacy,"Although the CIA guys were a little too smart to be realistic, I though that this was a pretty good action movie. Matt Damon is not the greatest actor in the world, but he pulled this one off well. However, I don't think they really should have made another sequel..."
2,poor shadow of the first one,"'Identity' was quite good. I especially liked the fight scenes and general flow.I'm not sure if this is the same crew or not on 'Supremacy' but it's mediocre to poor quality this time around. Lots of jerky and unclear camera action.The ostensibly 'main' fight scene with another Treadstone agent was poorly-lit, camera-jumpy, too close, and sloppy looking. A total joke compared with the coolness of the 'pen vs knife' fight in 'Identity' - which was well lit, both actors clearly visible, and with sharp believable and engaging choreography.Also, the protracted car chase in the latter part of the film almost put me to sleep.However, Jar Jar wasn't in it so maybe worth a matinee if you don't have grass growing to watch at home. Just rent 'Identity' instead."
2,ummm...,i personley dont like the movie because it has sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much chit chat witch realy got me board and the onley good think about it is the 2nd to last scene at the car chase. IT. period. The end
3,too over the top and crazy,weird and over the top.where was the plot. i have no idea what happened in this movie!!!!!
3,James Bond 2,"It is very gripping and I think many people would enjoy it as it is something like James Bond. If you had played ""Grand Theft Auto"", you would start thinking about it while you play. But I pefer to watch the movie to playing the game. The special effects of the show is not too good as the colour of the water is not too nice, who whould belive the colour of the water is green when it is blue in colour. I think they should put more light as most people can't see what is going on during the movie."
1,Better then the first... by about 2 crashes.,"Thats all, the car chase is barely better, and there is no other action sequence in the whole damn movie, acid trippin camera movements DONT COUNT AS ACTION SCENES, in fact they can ruin the only fight and car cahse you have (which they did), i guess they spent all their budget on all the cocaine they gave the camera guy instead of buying him a stand. The performances are average at best, the story is predictable and routine (the framing someon for a murder as been done, to death), there is humor, drama, suspense, nothing. 1 out of a 10 for the improved car chase, but it still isnt even remotly comparible to the one in Matrix Reloaded (the best car chase ever), no visual effects isnt really something to be proud of, dont make a third there cant possibly be a market left for this, but i guess since they are still making damn chucky movies, anything is possible."
1,How can they JUSTIFY calling this THE BOURNE SUPREMACY!?!,"The movie in and of itself was entertaining.HOWEVER, that said, I do not know HOW they can justify saying this movie was based on the book written by Robert Ludlum. This movie had as much in common with the novel as apples have in common with oranges. The majority of the novel is set in Hong Kong and Mainland China, NOT Europe.There is NOTHING in the novel about Russian oil leases, and Marie does not DIE in the first 15 minutes of the story. In fact, she does not DIE at all. She IS kidnapped, which is the lure that draws Jason in..."
1,The Hand-Held-Camera Stinks,"This movie would have been a 5 if the director would have just eliminated the Hand-Held-Camera. The music was nice and tight with the action...the acting was great and the story was good. I know someone personally who had to leave the screening and call 911 due to the JARRING effects of this movie. Shame on the director...This is not art, just another TV police show...Mikey"
3,THE BOOK WAS BETTER/AND MOTION SICKNESS,"If you read the book , and it were used for this movie, then it would be worthy of an Academy Award. Unfortunately , we are left with a paltry attempt at a sequel that just doesn't equal the first version. This could have been a terrific film if it weren't so ""jumpy"". It appears that the camera work was done on an amusement ride , even though this may have been used to help with the action. This is not worthy of the money to purchase this film but Jason Bourne character could have been the next Bond if there were a better story line and directing."
5,dvd set,"A great movie for Matt Damon. Jason Bourne is best seen by acquiring the whole set. This is part two of three. Get the set. Learn the secret behind the program that Jason Bourne was the initial start of. The invisible government has soldiers. This is the ""fictional"" story of one of them. I recommend this, but get the set."
3,"Not the Blair Witch Project, again!","I was really looking forward to the sequel to the Bourne Identity, but what I didn't realize was I was going to relive the ""Blair Witch Project"" again. The story is good and I really enjoyed Matt Damon in the sequel, but I left the movie with a really big headache--stop moving the camera!"
2,Director should give his paycheck back!!!,"Right off the bat I want to say that the story line and the acting in this film are both very good. If you liked the first BOURNE movie, you will like this one. HOWEVER, the director shouldbe fired and told to return his paycheck for what his did in post-production. It's like the director said to the camera man, ""OK, the fight is starting so START SHAKING THE CAMERA!!!"" ""OK, the chase is starting so START SHAKING THE CAMERA!!"" What should have been thrilling chases and fights were so jiggly and out of focus that I almost got seasick, seriously! I think a wonderful movie with wonderful acting got the short end of the stick with this director. I would like to see a third movie in the series with a director who actually shows the audience what is happening instead of making us feel like we are watching it from inside a running dryer. Good try, hoping for better next time."
2,"Exciting, But Don't Analyze It","This sequel is a fast-paced, dark oops-another-conspiracy movie, with superb acting by Matt Damon and Joan Allen. Nice chase scenes, nice locales...but totally ludicrous in the long run once the viewer starts realizing that Jason Bourne must be able to get into and out of any room or house or office or town he chooses, no matter what the security is.Sorry, but in my opinion this is a sequel in which the producers are more intent on locales and action rather than verisimilitude of the plot and character development."
4,My favorite of the Trilogy,This is my favorite of the Bourne series as it is the middle film where you are right in the center of the action...I think the characters work well together and there is already an inkling of the full back story of how Bourne became who he is. The action is fast-paced and we move with Bourne across the globe. My favorite scenes are those in Russia and Berlin. Highly recommended!
3,#2,A good second movie but just lacked the umph of the first movie. I always hate it when they kill off a MAIN character. If they hadn't gotten rid of her then might have given it one more star. THe excitement is still there and the story line is still good.
1,Required Previews,"I have no problem with this movie. I have a problem with the Previews before the movie. You can not go forward through the Previews. Asking to go forward often restarts the previews. What is this? If they had given me the DVD, I would be gracious enough not to complain about the previews. Why should I pay to watch their advertisements. (Yes, I have noticed I now pay to watch TV commercials) I am going to start returning DVD's with previews I can not fast forward through."
1,simply awful,"If you liked the first movie don't bother with this tripe. It's entirely a different film.The scriptwriter wanted something ""serious""--in other words, mean-spirited and a downer. The director helped out with a jiggly camera, poor lighting and other artsy-fartsy film noire effects. A total departure from the first film and utterly wrong-headed. (I suspect the usual Hollywood-coke-snorting pony-tailed in-crowd got their hooks into this project.)In short, boring trash that also manages to ruin the residual good feelings from the first movie."
2,Supreme Disappointment,"The much-discussed ""style"" of this production is indeed its downfall. Although the original was an engrossing thriller, this is like a theme park thrill ride version of it, with the faces & scenery painted on the walls. What's the point of having a great new rig for filming car chases when the final result is shaken & edited into a blur? A totally forgettable sequence.The story & acting were passable, but the direction & filming technique made it almost unwatchable. 'Shaky-Cam' is a stylistic trend that needs to end ASAP. About 40% of the film is so badly shaking it almost made us nauseous.Perhaps watching on a small TV in daylight would help.... Naah, just skip it. Way too short, also. No resemblance to the quality of The Bourne Identity at all. The whole result seems like an attempt to quickly git'r'done & go count the money. Thumbs WAY down. If you can't stand to miss it anyway, it's certainly one to rent before buying!"
1,Stick to the Book,"I rented the bourne supremacy tonight expecting it to at least follow the book, making it an awesome movie. It didnt at all. It was a decent movie i must say, but cutting out the entire book, except the two or three things that they didnt cut out but manages to screw up anyways. The only reason this is getting any stars is because the movie was action packed. Action packed doesnt mean a lot tho, because when you are trying to watch a good chase scene, and every two seconds you jump from one camera view to the other, it just doesnt fit together. All in all, a total dissapointment if you read the book, and not the best movie if you didnt."
4,Dont Buy the DVD yet!!!,"I really liked the first one..but i bought the DVD,when they came out with ,then about few months after,they came out with extra footage an all..this time i am gonna wait might about few months they comes with unrated version an DTS sound an all...so dont waste ur money on this DVD, like i did..i am pretty sure they comes with some unrated version or superbit or something like that down the road like they did with last one.. if u really wanna see it, just rent the movie insted for now!"
4,Bourne Indentity Crisis!,"WAYYYYYYYY better than the first, although, if you suffer from vertigo or take the drug ""Stematil"" for medical reasons , it's best not to see this film or you wont make it out of the movie theatre in one piece! Why only 4 stars? Because the camerawork made me so dizzy, I felt like a DJ on LSD in an amsterdam nightclub. I know that the director made the camerawork a little NYPD blue to emphasise the feeling of desperation and quick moving action, but c'mon already!! It's a good plot , good acting , crappy camerawork (which really wasn't needed), and unfortunately a lot less killing then the first movie, but still good to watch ( if you're prescription glasses are over 10+ )."
1,Amazon SUCKS,Sorry Amazon. I cannot recommend your technology to anyone. If I could rate a 0 I would.Trying to watch any video from Amazon is worse than having commercials. The film stops and starts. Sometime a wait is as long as 12 hours or more.The Bourne Supremacy is a great movie. Rate it 5 stars any time....
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A rather middling sequel to The Bourne Identity which suffers from the loss of Chris Cooper and Clive Owen (as villains) and Franka Potente (as love interest), the Bourne Supremacy is only supreme when it comes to mediocrity."
4,Bourne Surpremacy,This movie is a great sequel to Bourne Identity. You will enjoy the whole story line and love the action as well. Sit down and watch all 3 of the movies together and don't forget the popcorn. Matt Damon turns out a surprising performance.
1,Not all there,"I was disappointed to find at least onescene missing from the DVD. The sceneafter Bourne kills the other Treadstoneagent. I keep thinking that there areother scenes missing.Others have listed the problems of theshaky cameras and too close close-ups.I wish to say I agree with their comments.Part of the enjoyment of watching theBourne Identity was the relationshipbetween Matt Damon and Franka Potente.Since they killed her off in the beginning,they might have brought in someone elsefor Damon to relate to.Since there are more Bourne sequels inthe making, I hope someone is reading thecriticisms listed here and elsewhere andtries to correct the problems."
4,The transitional chapter of the Bourne Trilogy,"While still a fine addition to the Bourne trilogy, Supremacy is the weakest of the three. The plot suffers from a bit too much ""nothing happening"" until the end, and even that much is mostly setting up the final, superior movie."
4,Bourne Again,The movie was good. I wanted to see it again before I saw the new one Bourne Legacy which is a great action packed movie but I miss Matt. The only thing is I has some issues with the streaming that were frustrating. I had to start it three times and skip over a part in the beginning because it kept getting stuck. If it was a movie I hadn't seen before I would have been more upset. I probably could have got it to the perfect spot but as I had seen it I wanted to get on with the movie. This was in the first 5 minutes. After that it was fine. It is the first movie I have bought and streamed from Amazon-Prime and I thought it would be a little easier. The movie was as I remembered. Great trilogy
5,Best car chases ever,What can I say but I love all the Bourne movies and they always keep me at the edge of my seat. They're smart and action packed without using sex to make it worth watching. On of the best chases ever!
3,Use a tripod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The 3 stars are for Matt Damon and the erotic scene where he takes the girl out of the tram and takes her to the staircase. Was I the only one turned on?The other 0 stars are for the horrible filming of the movie. Who the hell puts a camera on their shoulder and runs around trying to catch up to the actors? I can see that crap on the show COPS. I was so dizzy and nauseous by the end of the movie.Way to ruin the movie, mr. director and mr. so-called camera man! If ya didn't want us to watch your movie ""the way it was intended,"" then you shouldn't have bothered filming."
4,Full of action,"From beginning to end, this fast-paced movie will keep the viewer riveted to this sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"". Jason Bourne is still an amnesiac, but as the movie progresses he remembers more details of his previous life. It's sometimes difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys, because someone is framing Bourne and has sicced his old agency on him. Everyone is after him but Bourne manages to avoid bullets, stakeouts, booby traps and whatever else the intelligence community can throw at him. Matt Damon does a creditable job in the lead role and this movie is good for an evening's entertainment."
3,Bourne Supremacy Not So Supreme,"My husband and I were really looking forward to this movie - even re-watched the DVD of Bourne Identity, but the jumpy camera work was hugely distracting and DETRACTING.Matt Damon portrays the tortured protagonist just fine. Brian Cox, Franka Potente, Joan Allen were all up to their roles. Julia Stiles was criminally underused. Karl Urban was appropriately fierce but am I the only one who thinks he continually (in LOTR also!) looks like someone is holding a small turd under his nose?The plot's fairly convoluted but we managed to unravel it in the after-show discussion. The big thing that keeps me from rating this higher is the horrible camera work. To think it was done purposely just blows my mind. Why do all these great stunts and then not allow us to see them? Phooey.So - story and acting a 4, camera work a 2 or less. Comes out to 3 stars, which is a cryin' shame."
2,An action film for the ADD generation,"he couldn't [cut] even [cut] wait 1/[cut]2 of a 1/2 second[cut] to finish a[cut] shot of some[cut] guy closing a car [cut]door....This [cut]is actually [cut]a [cut]repeat [cut]viewing; I went to[cut] [cut]the theater 5 years[cut] ago to see[cut] somethin[cut]g with my cousin, what it [cut]was, i can't[cut] remember, but whatever [cut]we wanted to see: we[cut] were too early, [ok, you get the point with the cutting] so we opted for this. I remember almost falling asleep in the theater, and it almost happened again last night. That was probably the most boring car chase I've ever seen this side of a Bay movie.Useless film."
3,Average action film,"Plenty of shootings and car chases but nothing to get excited about. Some of the plot hooks seemed far-fetched (but maybe they make more sense if you've seen the first movie). For some reason, I have a problem seeing Matt Damon as an ""action hero."" Overall, the movie is o.k. as long as you're not expecting too much."
3,Exceptional,"Felt like I went on a trip after seeing this movie. This movie was well worth it. Featuring exotic locations and car chases that are really captivating. The characters in the movie played their parts convincingly well, that you felt part of the movie.The sequel further develops the character of Jason Borne and provides more insights into his past as his amnesia seems to be wearing out. And how his emotional 'conflicts' are making this into a three dimensional James Bond type movie. What can I say; this is better than Bond series, with all the actions, sophisticated car chase scenes, the cat and mouse chase and the tactic between the killing machine and the world biggest organization. The soundtrack is also great."
4,"Not As Good as The First Bourne, But Entertaining","The Bourne Supremacy continues the adventures of reluctant assassin/spy Jason Bourne that began in The Bourne Identity.Bourne is now hiding out with his girlfriend from the first film when he is targeted for assassination. A surprise or two later, Bourne is again on the prowl, but instead of being just a hunted/wanted man as he was in the Bourne Identity, he commits to fighting proactively against those who are against him.The Bourne Supremacy has some great actions sequences, including a great fight scene with a fellow assassin, and one of the greatest car chases since Bullitt. The involved plot is sometimes too distracting, and the sheer fun and terror of the first film is diluted by all of this, but director Paul Greengrass does not ruin the film, and this film definitely keeps the viewer anticipating the next Bourne adventure."
3,"Great action, plot falls below par","The action in this movie is exhilirating and even better than the action if bourne identity. However, this movie just didnt seem as exciting and mysterious to me as the first one did. The first one kept you interested, first time I watched this movie I had trouble paying attention. It just doesn't meet the level of the first movie. I can understand how people with that all-action personality can praise this movie, but for the insightful movie-goer who seeks a strong plot, dont waste your time with this one."
4,Not as good as the first,"I thought it was an good sequel, but by itself it was a pretty lousy movie. There was none of the suspense of the first one where he is confused and learning what he really is. Plus the first one has a girl... In this one she dies like five minutes into the movie. And they make him out to be some sort of a machine, there should have been more plot twists. The only thing i didnt see coming was when he gets shot!!! And that only stopped him a little bit. I didnt like this one, but the first Bourne movie was so good, that i cant force myself to give its sequel a bad rating no matter how hard i try."
1,Flipper Defect Nightmare,"Universal decided to put flippers back on the market rather than pack in a DVD copy into a 2 disc case. Ooooh. Bad move. No more disc art, defective discs everywhere (rampant reports of Bourne Identity freezing for 15 seconds during a car chase are already surfacing). Universal executives, if you are watching....PLEASE STOP THE FLIPPERS. THEY WERE BAD IN DVD DAYS. THEY ARE BAD NOW. Pack in the DVD with the blu ray in the future, your end-of-year bonus check and family will thank you."
2,Why no DTS soundtrack?,"What is going on with UNIVERSAL PICS. Because of all of the extra junk that they put on this dvd they have no room left for the DTS soundtrack. Sad So SAD!!! They are doing this to all of their movies recently, STOP IT!!!"
2,videotography is terrible. The camera shakes all over the place.,"I like the character, I like the plot, but You WILL get nauseous trying to watch this movie! The videotography is terrible. The camera shakes all over the place. What is with some directors. I can hold my Sony camcorder a lot more steady. Ug! is the next sequeal as poorly filmed? I am hesitant to try it."
3,Shakiest cinematography ever,"I absolutely enjoyed the Bourne Identity and was looking forward to Supremacy, how-ever , the movie looks like it was shot completely using hand-held cameras; the amount of shake is extremely distracting, making it hard to watch this movie.My eyes were sore 30 minutes into the picture from trying to focus on what was going on.I hope the producers don't use the same cinematographer on the 3rd Bourne story the Bourne Ultimatum."
1,"Probably a good story, if you could see it.","I think most of the other reviewers already mentioned this, but movie was pretty much impossible to watch because of the camera work. I saw this in a theatre and actually had to close my eyes for about 10 minutes because I was getting nauseous. I loved the first movie and had high hopes for the sequel. From what I could tell, it was probably a pretty good movie. Too bad the director ruined it with ridiculously bad cinematography."
4,Suspense in Spades,"If it's action and suspense that you want, you'll get both in spades, with a ""knock your socks off"" cast and script. The car chase near the end of the movie, while gripping and exciting to watch, defies plausibility but doesn't detract from the suspense or the quality of the movie. Well worth watching for action aficionados and those who enjoy thrillers. Overall, 4+ stars."
2,Supremely disappointing...,"I loved the first Bourne movie and couldn't wait to see this one. Although the story was ok the cinematography was horrible. The highly excessive camera shake and extremely fast scene changes absolutely ruined the film in my opinion. I mean c'mon, there are some scenes where everything on the screen is motionless, except the camera. All that camera shake did not add any sort of realism, it just made it very difficult to watch the movie and sucked the fun right out of it. And regarding the quick scene changes, I imagine there are a select few humans who may actually be able to focus on the screen in the few nano-seconds allowed but I'm not one of them. I feel like I missed 1/2 the film because my eyes didn't get a chance to focus. And trust me, my eyes were fixed on the screen in a sincere attempt. Bottom line - if I could do it over again I would not see this movie in the theatre, not even if it was free."
4,Bourne Delivers! ****1/2,"The Bourne Supremacy is a great action thrill ride that works on every level, even when you know it shouldn't because of plausability factors. Matt Damon is perfect as the amnesiac asassin, who must come out of hiding to save his name and life after he is found by a Russian agent. Joan Allen is very good as the person in charge of finding Bourne, and she helps take this franchise to the next level, as you respect her and what she is doing. Brian Cox is back on board as the man in charge of the operation that was terminated after Bourne left, and he is old reliable self. Julia Stiles has a bit more air time and has a very emotional scene with Bourne, as does Franka Potente as Bourne's lover. Paul Greengrass does a good job of replacing Doug Liman and the film is, like its predesessor, a cut above the rest of the action films and spy genre. Jason Bourne makes James Bond look like a nobody in the secret agent world."
2,"I want 1/2 my money back, I could only see 1/2 the movie!!","The action was good, the car chase in the end was great, the story was good. . .I think. Half the movie you couldn't make out because the camera was shaking so bad! I almost got sick in the theater and I'm nowhere near a person who gets motion sickness. I can understand what the director was going for. He wanted to make you feel like you were right along side Jason Bourne, but he used it way too much! Literally, about half the movie is a blur. In the end, the first one was a lot better. Some of the action scenes were good and there is a little bit of a twist in the end. Honestly, I would save your money and wait for rental. Atleast then, you can have a trash can nearby incase you feel like you are going to vomit."
3,not the same director as Bourne Identity - and it shows...,"The Bourne Identity directed by Doug Liman was excellent. However, this second installment, The Bourne Supremacy, is not filmed by the same director and it makes all of the difference in the world.The movie overall is ok, but it can't hold a candle to the first one. The main reason for my dismay at this movie is the choice made by director Paul Greengrass to use handheld cameras almost exclusively. In every scene, the camera appears to be wiggling around. It gives the film a cheap look - as if it was filmed with a bargain bin camcorder.I understand the use of this technique when Bourne is running, or during a car chase. But through the whole movie? Give me a break! It makes the film difficult to watch, and is just downright annoying at times.If you get motion sickness easily - be prepared!"
2,Where's Liman and what happened to following the book?,"This movie dissapointed me alot. First off, who is Paul Greengrass? I mean, if Liman would have directed this film it would have been a way better flick. Second, if anyone has read the book, you would have realized how awesome the plot was and how this would have been a blockbuster if it would have followed it. In the book, Bourne's own government kidnapps his wife and Bourne must kill an assasin in search of his wife. This is all set in the Far East. Now that is a good plot. Instead, Bourne's wife is killed within ten minutes of the movie and it just falls apart after that. Ludlum would be rolling in his grave if he found out. I really think this would have been a decent film if it was set in China or Hong Kong and it followed the book more. Anyways whoever directs the Bourne Ultimatum should follow the novel."
3,Fast-paced action thriller,"I personally did not like this movie as much as I liked The Bourne Identity, but it is still thoroughly enjoyable. The storyline is the best part. Also, there is an awesome car chase scene; the only problem I have with this movie is the way they filmed some of the action sequences (with the unstable camera). Sure it makes it seem more realistic, but the audience misses out somewhat on the otherwise cool fight scenes."
5,Awesome action-packed movie!!,This movie was better than the first and it never slowad down from the get-go. Matt Damon is perfect for this role as the butt-kicking amnesiac looking for his identity. This movie is definitely worth checking out!
2,ANOTHER CRAPPY SEQUEL!,"The Bourne Identity was a really good movie! If you can'tmake a good sequel, why bother? This movie held my interestfor about 20 minutes, then put me to sleep. Absolutely nocomparison to the first! UNRECOMMENDED!"
3,Camera footage sucks in action scenes.,I have to say I haven't seen camera action like this since the XFL.I hope the DVD is not as bad. The camera moves so much in the action scenes I had a hard time following what was happening and it really spoiled it for me. I had to look away at times as it felt like my seat was moving.The car chase is one of my all-time favorites. That was some really nice work.
3,Good customer service,"Order was overlooked and never shipped. After contacting the seller, the seller immediately shipped my order to me as well as adding an extra item for the delay. Good customer service."
4,Nicely done.,"I was prepared to not like Bourne II, having been warned of the fast cuts. But they were so well done that (to me) it made perfect sense. If any of the incidents depicted were to happen in real life the first thing people would say was ""It all happened so fast...""Matt Damon is perfect for this because he's not cute enough to be a distraction. Imagine Ben Affleck crashing a car and then dissapearing into a crowd in Moscow.Although the plot is 100% predictable the movie is fun and my 20 minute test came and went (this is when I check my watch).So enjoy. And let me also reccomend the somewhat less sophisticated The Transporter. If you're looking for Sophie's Choice, neither of these will appeal to you but but trust me, both pass the 20 minute test easily."
2,The car chase scene was the only part I liked,"The feeling in this movie is nowhere near the same feeling in the first one. I felt a solid relationship between Matt Damons character & Franka Potente so that helped me enjoy the movie-it felt like they were real people not just characters in a movie. However, in this movie I felt no connection with any character and it just felt like the first except no leading female. How many times are people going to try to kill Jason Bourne? The camara work was too much for this movie, too. At times I felt nautious and I wanted to close my eyes. But the car chase toward the end was wonderful. He just wanted to end the chase and chase brought into a tunnel was great."
4,The Bourne Supremacy - Almost Great,"A great action movie (not art film)which was almost ruined with the ""artsy"" hand-held camera. With all of the innovative mechanics for the camera available today, why employ an out of date technique - the jerky, hand-held camera? Matt Damon's excellenbt action sequences could not be fully appreciated and the car chase sequences were hard to follow. It did add to the tension - I wanted to assassinate the director. The bad guy was too obvious. Matt Damon was perfect in his role and the rest of the strong supporting cast were great, especially Joan Allen. I would have given this movie a 5 star rating if not for the irritating camera work."
3,It's okay,Go the DVD used. It could have been cleaned up a little better. Got it for my husbands collection. Thanks
2,James Bond on Speed,"Skip this one, unless your attention span is less than 10 seconds, which is about the longest cut in the film. It really is like watching two hours of the shower scene in the original Psycho movie. I feel sorry for the cast which do a really good job, but their talents are cut short by the directors' apparent lack of confidence in their abilities as demonstrated by his over dependence on the edior who cut and pastes the film together out of short three to five second long takes. It took me a long time to get interested in the film after its weak opening scenes only to lose that interest again mid way through because of the relentless kaleidoscopic effect of the editing."
2,Not what I had hoped for,After seeing the first movie wich I think was one of the best actions flics in a long time I was waiting to see what the did to top it in the sequel.Bid disapointment. The camerawork and constant cuts even make a nice place like Goa India not look nice. It much darker. At one point Jason Bourne walks down a stair to a subway. I could not even see him in this shot for 2 seconds. Like your father in law is following you with his handycam to the basement of you house an there is not enough light.I think the movie takes a tip down the hill right at the beginning when Jasons girlfriend gets killed. She was a big contribution in the first movie and taken that away there is less left.I could tell my wife what the sorry was and who would kill who just befor almost any scene.So This movie is by for not as good as the first one and not worth buying.Sorry.
2,Would not hold up under repeated viewings,"I felt the advertisements for this movie were very misleading. It showed the character Marie in the trailers, but she was only in the movie for a few minutes. There was no charming conversation or chemistry like in the first movie. Pretty much a solo mission. So I subtract one star for that. Also, I felt the story was week. Although there was plenty of action, it could not compensate for the lame story. The ending seemed depressing and out of character. So I subtract another star for that. Then I also agree with the other reviews that complained about the camera shaking. Once in a while is OK, but not through the majority of the movie. I subtract a 3rd star for that. It was definitely a one time watch and would not hold up under repeated viewings. I don't think we should blame Matt Damon though, I'm sure he thought it would be a good movie and as an actor, he was at the mercy of the director and the editor."
5,The Bourne Supremacy,Item arrived in the condition promised and in a decent manner of time!Price was great! I was a little suprised to see French on the front.
1,rip off,This was a terrible copy of a copy with the scenes incredibly dark with futuristic green flesh tones.Do not buy thisIMO
3,"Good, but not as good as first two","While I am a big fan of the Bourne series, this one is my least favorite of the bunch. It just seems to repetitive and many elements are there simply because they were there in the earlier movies (at least to me ;-). Sometimes having an action sequence is great, but when it seems to be forced into the story, well it just doesn't come off as well.I would recommend this movie for rental but not purchase unless part of the complete 3 movie set."
2,Drammamine required,"I do not understand Paul Greengrass's choice of camera action. It is highly erratic. A dose of Dramamine is recommended before watching this movie. Perhaps it is a lack of the ability to actually plan a scene? Why plan when we can disguise the lack of scene planning with erratic camera movement????? It is hard to enjoy this movie, take in the scenes when the camera movement makes you sea sick."
3,More of the Same,This movie is just a copy of the first one in terms of plot and action scenes and like any copy it is not as good as the original.
4,"worthy followup, not overly sentimental","4/5Loses a star for being basically the same idea as the first film - the CIA is trying to kill him and he is on the run. Like the last time, he's willing to fight back.Kudos for the writers for not making this an overly sentimental film. The main bad guy in the film is a relentless Russian Secret Service agent, who reminds me of the Serbian sniper from the film Behind Enemy Lines.They say the adult thriller genre faded away after being peaking in the 70s. Hopefully, more quality thrillers will be made once this film is confirmed in a few days as a bona fide smash. Also, rent the astonishing sleeper film Spartan, if you enjoy the Bourne films.Worth seeing if you liked the first one.by Triniman"
3,Will you please stop shaking the camera!!!,"I loved the first bourne movie and I would have liked this one a lot more if the director hadn't felt the need to shake the camera violently everytime a good action scene was on. You know, it really doesn't help me enjoy the movie when I feel extremly dizzy after a car chase scene. What the hell was this director thinking?. The story was actually pretty good but I just couldn't take the camera shaking. I just hope to god that the director doesn't do the same thing with the third bourne film."
2,"Not the sequel ""Identity"" deserves","This film depended much more on action and special effects than its predecessor, which used Damon's and Potente's chemistry and acting abilities. I think Potente was a powerful, under appreciated element in ""Identity"" but in the sequel she was immediately killed off, leaving Jason to scowl, frown, track, and kill. I wonder how few words he actually said in this movie after Marie was killed. Now Brian Cox's character is dead which I think will hurt future sequels."
2,"Shake, shake, shake...shake your camera!","Loved Bourne Identity. Sorry, but found this film a pain to sit through. I call it the wandering camera technique -- why some directors insist on using it I will never know. But the constant shaking of the camera I find irritating to the point I get physically nauseous. So very many people with whom I have chatted have expressed a similar irritation at this camera technique. Get the camera back on its sticks (tripod), please!"
3,Short and to the point,"As an action movie, it rocks. 5 Stars.As a espionage movie, it rocks. 5 Stars.The complementary music and sound rocks. 5 Stars.The visuals are pretty good and puts you right in the mood. 5 Stars.The camera work stinks. 1 Star.Overall: 3 stars.I don't need to be rolling around the room when Bourne kills another bad guy! It doesn't help the food in your stomach either for those prone to motion sickness."
3,Boring Supremacy,"After seeing the Bourne Identity I had such high hopes for the sequel and they crashed and burned upon seeing it. While the movie is probably worth viewing once (at least if you saw the first one), I could not recommend you waste money buying it."
3,Tssk Tssk Tssk...,"Bourne really did lose it's ""Identity"", if you know what I mean.The only thing this movie had against Identity is that this one was more intense; more action. But that doesn't neccesarily make Supremacy worthy. The way they ended The Bourne Identity, it would have been much better if they had left it alone. They pretty much fudged the whole concept.After watching the first movie, you would be like ""Ooh, THAT's how it happened"", but in this one they shove it all right in front of you, complete with rigid, come-and-go camera shots. The first time I watched it, it didn't bother me, but by the second time I realized there was nothing really worth pondering afterwards. :("
2,Where's the real Bourne Supremacy?,"My favorite author is Robert Ludlum, and I especially loved his Jason Bourne books. I was looking forward to this movie, but after seeing it, I wondered why didn't they stick to the story line? The books are great. The movie was a disappointment because it had nothing to do with the book."
2,Bourne Sequel Not Supreme,"After Bourne Identity which was terrific. I expected even better sequel. Sad to say. Not even so. First of all, Marie was killed after being shot accidentally while the intended victim was Bourne. Which quite frankly I didn't understand since. In the Bourne novels she is very much alive. But the sequel failed to explain how Bourne came to be. The plot in the movie had so many unexplained answers to questions that need answering. That it was more actionfest than movie. Keep Bourne Identity in your library not Supremacy."
3,The Bourne Mediocrity,"I didn't think that it was too bad, except for the Russians. When a Mexican or Spaniard appears in a film, they hire a Mexican or Spaniard. When a German appears in a film, they hire a German. When Russians appear, they hire some bums off the streets and have them speak with horrible accents. Honestly, in Washington state last year 55% of the new immigrants were Russian or Ukrainian. New York gets tens of thousands of Russian immigrants per year. They can find some real frickin' Russians.The one main Russian character wasn't too bad until the end. He started mispronouncing words. Simple words like 'car'. They even had Bourne refer to a woman as a man!! He asked her if she understood, but he asked it as if he was addressing a man (Russian conjugates past tense verbs according to the gender of the subject). Those were only the glaring oddities. Other misuses of a beautiful language were only minor, but enough to take me completely out of the film."
4,Beautiful look at clash of cultures,"This movie captures the eye throughout with beautiful scenery, colors and people. Though generally described as a sexy romance, the movie really looks at the clash of staid British culture (and imperialism) with the more emotional and erotic African/Creole peoples in the Caribbean. Not a perfect film, but filled with passion."
1,Not Worth the money,I had a hard time figuring out what the movie was about. I'm a Nathanial Parker fan which was the reason for purchasing the movie. I thought the movie was very disjointed. Mr. Rochester (Parker) marries a woman with severe mental problems stemming from her childhood and voodoo.
1,read the book!,"once again, a classic novel made into a terrible film. nothing good about this one i'm sorry to say (even end of the affair was better, but then again, that was a better book), on top of everything acting is almost to the point of caricature. and not erotic in the least, not even the saving grace of some decent sex scenes!"
2,To buy or not to buy,"I was dispointed from seying this movie. After seing Wild Orchid movies, 9 182 weeks movies and two moon junction movies i was expecting Wide Sargo Sea to be a great movie after seing the editorial about it. The course of the movie was really good but near the end when she looses everything was tragic to mee. I did not get the point of this movie. it's worth renting. But I certainly would not buy it."
3,Interesting and Haunting Movie,"The film opens with an explanation of why the mother of the main character, Antoinette, goes insane thus leaving her in the care of her aunt. Because her mother's second husband is English, her aunt makes the arrangements for Antoinette to marry Rochester.After the marriage, Antoinette falls more and more in love with Rochester, while he becomes disturbed by the heightened emotions and attraction. From there the relationship deteriorates and ultimately Rochester decides to return to England, taking Antoinette with him.The scenes and cinematography are so lush and beautiful. They really do an interesting job of making the Jamaican home seem like the ideal prision for Rochester.The story was haunting, but it needed some editing. It could have been a bit shorter and the sex scenes were more graphic than necessary, but it's an adult movie with adult topics.I enjoyed the movie, but it's not one that I would watch multiple times."
4,Interesting concept,"This is the story of Mr. Rochester's mad wife and how they got together. I only gave this video 4 stars because I like the concept and the story itself was intriguing.The editing wasn't all that great and the screenplay didn't do much for me. I didn't mind that it was erotic. You can choose your rating btw and watch hotter if you like. I watched the lesser ""R"" rating and wished there had been a PG. I really did not need to see Mr. Rochester naked, but some people may like that.I liked that it was told in the wife's point of view. That was intriguing. I didn't like how it made Mr. Rochester look in parts because I thought it was unfair. But, I'm admittedly a Mr. Rochester fan so perhaps that's colored my opinion.All in all I wish I had rented this. But if you can't rent it I think it is worth buying."
2,The frustrating story,"While there was some classy nudity and sexual content in the story which made the movie tolerable, the story line itself was frustrating and depressing. In the end I wanted to throw it in the trash along with the bad bannana that I had eaten."
4,This is a great album.,"This album finally deals with ghetto issues. It explores alot of the problems with ghetto culture. It allows people to break through these barriers in a meaningful way. The album is honest, real and inspired. I loved it!"
2,just average,"outside of R.Kelly,Isley Brothers&Outkast I can take or leave the rest of the Songs here."
3,Great treat but...,this i believe is a great dog treat the only problem is i have yet to find a toy that will outlast the treat the toys designed to use with these treats seem to be made of a soft rubber that my dog chews into pieces the treats seem to keep him busy better then the toys themselves I gave this 3 stars because it is a good treat just has no use if the toys designed for them cant keep up I would suggest a ever-locking treat for a good chew treat for your pooch
2,My dog isnt into these.,Sadly i got really excited when i saw this and the toy these go into that i bought a few flavors and the toy ASAP. She isnt into them =[ hopefully she comes around and starts to use it but we will see. If she does i will make an update!
3,Everlasting Treat,Great if the dog doesn't get the treat out of the ball when its first inserted...Hard to insert so it amazes me how the dog can achieve the task of getting the treat out of the ball when new...Like the buy three deal and get the fourth free...
2,Everlasting? uhhhhhh NO,"These are decent treats to keep your dog busy for a while, but if the word ""everlasting"" is what's making you consider buying...move on. I have two german shepherds. They aren't mega chewers but enjoy a treat. These things last about 10mins MAX with them. I have two types of ""holders"" for the treats and the dogs manage to crack the treat part in a minute or two then just gnaw on it for a few more minutes until its done. For the price they are asking on these, definitely get something else."
2,"Tiny, gone in a few seconds","These treats are much smaller than I thought they would be, and they only lasted a few seconds with my dogs. For the price, I could have bought a whole bag of treats and the dogs would have gotten the same enjoyment. I gave them two stars only because my dogs did seem to like the taste. But then, they're not exactly picky."
1,not ever lasting and makes dog sick,not long lasting really and makes the dog sick when she eats too much of the treat. I have to take it away from her after a few minutes so she doesn't eat too much. If she eats the whole thing she gets the hershey squirts (liquid stool frequently). I think a better long lasting treat is peanut butter inside a bone or kong FROZEN. That keeps her busy and she doesn't get sick.
1,Everlasting Treats - Wrong size,"I ordered the product and thought I was getting the large size. I called the shipper, no returned calls and I can't really use the item shipped as I needed the large item.How do I return, the shipper doesn't return the calls. Not a happy customer of this product."
2,The downward spiral,"As other reviewers have noted, Tim Finn's voice ain't what it used to be! Tim once had an amazing sound and an incredible range. Now he sounds as though he's at death's door. I've seen him a few times live in the last few years and have noticed this steady decline. Tune-wise there are a couple of good melodies, but nothing to compare with the beautiful ""Persuasion"" from his previous solo album or anything from the Enz days. The production values are awful- this sounds like a demo."
2,The voice is gone,"I've been a fan of Tim finn from the Split Enz days, and it really amazes me to read the positive reviews of this album! The songs are ok for the most part, but something really bad has happened to Tim's voice. It sounds like he has had some serious problem with his vocal cords. Some of the songs are sung totally out of tune, and if you listen closely, you can hear him struggle to stay on tune in most of the songs. Try a listen to ""Need to be right"" and see if I'm not right. He used to have one of the most stunning voices in Rock, so this is really a shock. For fans only, and be prepared for a shock."
3,a new tim,"This album is not an unmitigated disaster as some reviews suggests. There are the usual catchy songs and some vibrant guitar playing thanks to producer Jay Joyce. Tim has changed--he's trying for a definitive statement and succeeds in places, but it is a new Tim. His voice is low, buried in the mix and scratchy in places, while samples and loops(as on brother Neil's solo album), abound. I've listened to it several times and think that this album could ""grow on you,"" despite some iffy tracks and the absence, for the most part, of Tim's trademark soaring vocals."
4,Short annotation on Billy Sunday Speaks,"A collection of 1,000 epigrams or sentence sermons, separated by 27 subjects. Dust cover says content collected by Sunday`s wife ""Ma"" and campaign music assistant B.D. Ackley."
4,Album review,"Aside from the occasional song on the radio this was my first real exposure to Patti Smith and I have been impressed. Disk 1 is especially good, disk 2 is more out there but is worth a listen."
1,Sorely Disappointed,"...[Why] does this tossed together mess sound so stale to me now?Could I have finally outgrown it; or, horrors, is it just that there is really little going on but high school poetry over 50's guitar licks? This compilation highlights the sameness of her songs and the limitations of the band.Piss Factory sounds great. It's downhill from there. Writing this makes me terribly sad...."
2,Holy digital technology!,"This is a reissue of the 1966 soundtrack for the original Batman television show. It doesn't feature the hit single version of the ""Batman Theme"" by Neal Hefti. The version here is by Nelson Riddle. All the music here, other than the ""Batman Theme"", is credited to Nelson Riddle. But in fact, ""Batusi A-Go! Go!"" and ""To the Batmobile"" are rewrites of the ""Batman Theme"". Plus, ""Two Perfectly Ordinary People"" is a ripoff of ""The Stars and Stripes Forever"", and ""Batman Thaws Mr. Freeze"" is based on a classical melody that I can't remember the title of. The music here isn't all that great, although I must admit that ""Holy Flypaper"" is a pretty good sax and guitar instrumental. The CD also features a lot of the campy dialogue from the show. The biggest ripoff about this album is that it's only 24 minutes long. This is for hardcore Batman collectors only."
2,"OK for beginner programmers, otherwise don't bother","The book was ok overall, giving some useful info on Java and got me started, but seemed to focus attention on brand new programmers (at least to object oriented languages). I have very little programming experience, and found the book overly simplified and lacking useful examples (too much ""toy"" code). The title is very misleading too (not really Java 1.2), a third of the book is based on applet code using Java 1.02, and nearly the rest of the book is Java 1.1 code. The only code I found that did not compile on a 1.1 compiler was the very last two ""days"" on Swing."
1,The Tittle is a gimmick to sell books.,"I got this a year ago and it was way over my head. I read it again now, and I see why.Chapter 2Q: What's the distinction between instance variables and methods and their counterparts, class variables and methods?A: Almost everything you do in a Java program will involve instances (also called objects) rather than classes. However, some behavior and attributes make more sense if stored in the class itself rather than in the object. For example, to create a new instance of a class, you need a method that is defined and available for the class itself....It just gets too convoluted for chapter 2! The explanations are sparse! Even though the title sounds like a beginners book, its Not for beginners at all. It should be called Java tongue twisters! ... At least the book looks pretty! I will not mention the ""Idiot's"" guide to Java 1.2!"
1,This book is like a car with 2 gear shifts 1 and 4,You'll find yourself in the first gear in the first few pages.... then in the fourth gear where you get nausea. Then back in the first gear. You get the Picture.
2,Java 1.0 with some 1.2 !,"It's ok, if your a beginner, but don't buy it if you know the basic Java programming and want to learn about Java 1.2 new features. The book covers few of the Java 1.2 features. I think the booK had too much awt stuff, and too little swing."
4,"If you like ""Frampton Comes Alive"", Get this album.","This gem is hard to find, as it is now out of production. It is a studio album that contains many of the songs found on the live album. It is generally considered to be his best effort."
2,"A heartfelt saga, but dated from a medical standpoint.","As the mother of a daughter with leukemia, I found this a moving tale of one family's struggle with leukemia, but for those whose children have been recently diagnosed (1998-99), keep in mind that the author describes medical protocols, procedures, even family activities that are out-of-date with current philosophy. Many of the family's experiences are no longer common or allowed by responsible pediatric oncologists. For this reason, the book may be misleading and inaccurate to some families. A much better guide to leukemia is Nancy Keene's book, ""Childhood Leukemia."""
4,Quality but quirky,"I ordered two of these, knowing they came with sleeves to fit the negative battery post. What I did NOT anticipate, however, was that they are stamped ""+"" on top which looks a little odd when attached to a negative post. This is not visible once the plastic covers are in place, just figured I'd let buyers know.Also, the allen screw that tightens the clamp onto the battery post strips out very easily. Don't even think of using a wrong size allen head, make sure you have the largest possible that will fit or you will be searching for a replacement screw. Overall, though, the quality is very good and lends a truly clean, custom look to my engine bay. These are impossible to beat for the money!"
3,"Works, But could be better",This terminal is nice because it came with an insert so that you can connect to either the positive of negative side of the battery so if you are looking to match buy 2 of these. The problem arises from the cover. When mounting it once the battery the cover wouldn't fit unless the terminal was placed towards the top of the battery's terminal. and the screw that clamps the cover down almost didn't tighten enough to hold it securely on the battery. If i wasnt using the cover this wouldn't have been an issue but i bought this terminal solely because of the plastic cover.
5,Nice addition to your car,"I don't know what that other guy is talking about. This is a high quality piece that I don't think I could break if I tried. I've actually connected and un-connected this item several times over the course of the last few months (can't make up my mind about what amp and speakers I want in my car). Not once did I ever think it was going to break.The screws hold the wires tight and the cover fits on very snugly. Comes with an insert ""sleeve"" in case you want to use it on either the positive or negative battery terminal.Really looks nice once it's installed under your hood."
3,Not what I needed.,"Well when I ordered it, I was hoping the holes would be big enough so I can stick my bigger wires in the bigger holes (that's what she said), but it was too small. It looks like a well built product and all, but just don't need it. Got my money back on it, so I'm not going to complain too much. Thanks Amazon"
5,"For the money, can't beat it","I got this for my 96 Ford Ranger. I don't have an amp yet, but I do plan on adding one in the future. I also plan on adding a power inverter soon.I do have a pair of auxiliary lights wired through a relay, to the battery. It's only 10 gauge wire, but the 8 gauge openings tighten down enough to secure it.The main power connection for my engine is a pair of wires, one looks to be 4 gauge, the other 6. I trimmed them down, stripped them, put them both in the 0 gauge opening.When I get an amp, I'll connect it to the 4 gauge opening, and I'll connect my power inverter to the remaining 8 gauge opening. It comes with a little metal insert for the battery connection, in case your battery is smaller. I didn't need it, but it's nice that they included it. Obviously this won't work with a battery with terminals on the side. (which GM cars use, I believe)"
2,ok if you can figure out how to make it fit.,this is a nice heavy made product but it would be nice if they would make it the size it needs to be.it was to big for the positive post on my battery it would not tighten down.the bushing that they send to make it fit the negitive post makes the positive post to big!!! and i find this out after i cut the end off of my factory leeds.luckly i own a lathe and had some brass so i ended up making an insert to make a brand new product work.maybe i will call and see if they would like some inserts.they will even work like they should.
5,Works Well - Good Solid Contacts,"I bought this because my positive connection to my battery slipped off randomly one morning so I figured I should try and get something a little better that offeres more options that regular terminal.Quality of this terminal is 9/10 - I say that because the plastic pieces that go over top don't seem to want to snap on fully for me, I don't know if that's just me or the product itselfI like having different sized holes for adding power wires and/or ground wires in future if I need toIt also has the benefit of adding a nice touch under hood without being too flashy"
4,Charlie Shine,"Excellent compilation. However, where is the Extended Remix of 'Method of Modern of Love' by Arthur Baker and 'Adult Education' by John 'Jellybean' Benitez ?. Unfortunately, both are missing on this album...but definitely a great album. BMG please don't do it again."
5,An excellent history of physics for physicists,"This is a superb history of 20th century of physics written for physicists more than historians. It does an excellent job of discussing the history, but also takes time to really talk about the ideas and the intellectual struggles to understand the ideas. The first half of the book (physics before WWII) is really the gem, with the second half more of an afterthought."
2,As much a journal as a book,"At points, this book tells a tale and is readable. At other times, it feels more like a diary, journal, or work in progress.One topic I was interested in was the development of the weak force. The book mentions some conferences, equations, and says hundreds or thousands of papers were published. This was about 4 pages. I was hoping more for the story and highlights here. It is one of the four fundamental forces. It does have an interesting history from the study of radioactivity, its role in fusion, the discovery of Z particles, etc.Then, neither as a plus or minus, simply a comment: The book can be highly technical. In general, I wouldn't describe it at all as a book for the general public.For a more general survey and reader, you might look at Emilio Segre or Frank Close's books. Segre gives much of a human account, and Close's short book provides a good summary."
4,Up and Coming,"I love this whole CD! The first time I heard one of her songs was on the TV series, GET REAL. Tell Me I'm the One....what a great song and it's soooo easy to ""relate"" to all of her songs."
1,never received merchandise,"Never received the CD, therefore I can't rate it. It's been well over a month."
1,Don't Waste Your Days Listening To This CD.,"Well, I heard her first single and thought she was ok. I didn't buy this cd because I thought ""Fun Of Your Love"" was just a nappy little love song. Then I won this cd over the radio. I thought heck, I'll give it a listen. I was very well impressed with her. After I listened again, I found out it was her background singers that were singing! I warn and advice everyone that this cd is not worth the money you pay!"
4,"Delicious, but beware of expiration dates!","These cookies are great - a perfect breakfast when you're on the go. My only concern about ordering them from Amazon again is experation dates. I ordered a 24 pack of Oatmeal Raisin and a 24 pack of Fruit & Nut. The Fruit & Nut's expired 3 weeks after shipment, and the Oatmeal Raisin expired 5-6 weeks from shipment. I don't plan on eating them quite that fast, so I'll have a bunch of expired cookies on my hands. I've got them in the freezer, so hopefully that'll do the trick, but beware nonetheless.They're much cheaper here than at the Baker's website, (12 for $15 vs. 24 for $18), so if you don't plan on eating 2 a day, order them one pack at a time. Baker's site does have a vastly wider selection, so maybe try them all first, then order from Amazon."
4,It's behind my cross!,"I was on the edge of my seat as this ""documentary"" took place.The begining is a little slow but once the Rev. Marcus gets to the Sweeten farm, all hell breaks lose.Nell is possesed or is it a psych problem?I have the movie behind my cross on the shelf."
4,"Original,Funny,Suspenseful & Thought provoking !!!","This isn't a cheesy horror flick, like most movies in this genre.This is along the lines of ""Blair Witch Project"", ""Cloverfield"",""Paranormal Activity"",etc.It's,cleverly made with a mix of humour and suspense thriller,with good actingperformances and a twisted ending."
1,MAJOR SUCKAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS MOVIE TRULY SUCKED AND THE TRAILER AND REVBIEWS GAVE IT ENTIRELY TOO MUCH CREDIT. CANT BELIEVE I WASTED PRECIOUS MOMENTS OF MY LIFE WATCHING THIS
1,USE THIS TO LINE YOUR PARAKEET CAGE,"I HAVE GOT TO SAY THIS WAS IN THE TOP 3 WORST MOVIES IVE EVER SEEN. WHEN YOU USE ANY FORM OF THE WORD ""EXCORCIST"" IN THE TITLE OF YOUR MOVIE- IT HAD BETTER NOT SUCK. THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL IN SOME WAY PAY HOMAGE TO AND DRAW FROM THE ORIGIONAL, TO ME IT SHOULD ANYWAY. YOU WOULDNT MAKE A "" BOURNE"" OR "" JAMES BOND"" MOVIE AND NOT HAVE IT REVOLVE AROUND CLOAK AND DAGGER TYPE STUFF....AND IT HAD BETTER NOT SUCK. WELL, I WONT GO INTO DETAILS- LETS JUST SAY THAT AMATEURISH EFFECTS, PAPER THIN PLOT AND NO REAL DRAW OF YOUR INTEREST UNTIL THE VERY LAST SCENE/FEW MINUTES WOULD BE KIND."
3,better then i thought,i wanted to see it in the movies but i didn't think it was worth it. so i got the dvd and i was very happy i did. I like the style it was shot in and the ending was a very good one.
3,"ok, but still disappointed","***SPOILER ALERT***I don't want to be one of those people who give away an ending.Well I am a big fan of The Exorcist and The Blair Witch Project. I'm also of the belief that what they did in The Blair Witch Project is only effective once. Now I'm not saying I hated The Last Exorcism, but I was disappointed with the way it was filmed, although it was a little steadier camera then Blair Witch, for the most part. I generally enjoyed the film until the end. I understand what happened and agree with a lot of people that what happened was exactly what was in the pictures in Nell's room, and yes I believe she was possessed. My problem with the ending is that it was anticlimactic. It didn't build the tension long enough for me. One other thing I haven't heard anyone else mention is that I believe the demon entered Caleb and killed the cameraman. It was still ok, but I was disappointed because I'm a big fan of Eli Roth and was expecting much more, in my opinion."
1,REALLY!!!,"Had I known that the best part of the movie was the trailor I sure as heck would not have purchased this crap!!!!! The story line picks up five minutes before the credits, I sat waiting and watching but NOTHING!!!! I wasted an hour and a half of my life that I can't get back. Man I feel used!!!"
1,This ain't Exorcist,"Let's face it. Aside from the original Exorcist of the seventies, movies of this genre are usually not very good. ""The Last Exorcism"" changes nothing. It had great setting and premise, but then simply didn't deliver and fell flat on it's face. The end was just atrocious and spoiled what was already a mediocre movie. It was like they couldn't think of a good finale and the office assistant or some other amateur took over. I felt cheated for want of a better word. Don't waste your time and money on this."
3,A little different,An interesting take on exorcism but a bit slow on excitement. Definitely would not add this to my movie collection. Special effects were okay but not great.
1,B horror,"I wish I could get my 4 bucks back. It looks like a movie from the 1950,s or 60's. it looked like how cheap can we make a movie and sell it"
2,"Could of been better, fell on its face a few times.","I was expecting alot more out of this movie. There were four or five good scares besides that this movie fell flat on its face. I thought the ending could of been better to, it is almost like they ripped off the ending of rosemarys baby, which by the way is 10 times better than this movie."
2,"Good start, tense middle, puzzling end","This docu-film begins with a biography of preacher Marcus Cotton, a man with contradictory religious beliefs who preaches in order to make money. He does exorcisms on the believers, knowing full well it is a trick although a well intentioned one.Cotton gets more than he asked for when he meets Nell and the Sweetzers. The family covers up a rough past and uses Nell's apparent possession as a way to escape their troubles. The father hopes that her exorcism will solve their problems.The start and middle are great, filled with creepy atmosphere and the witchery and entrenched superstitions of the South, but at the end it unravels, giving the audience too much to believe in too short a time. At times the film makers have their own conflicts about whether they wanted to make a true ""Exorcist"" style film or a film about religious frauds, faith and reason.Last Exorcism will treat you to a decent but uneven spectacle."
2,"Awful Horror Film, but Entertaining Comedy!","The protagonist has a lot of very funny lines and comedic scenes during the first half. Unfortunately, when the movie attempts to shift into horror mode, it fails magnificently. First of all, it's simply not scary. Secondly, and more damningly, every scare scene is preceded by ""scary music"" rising on the soundtrack. Why is this a problem? Because it's supposed to be 'found footage'! Why would 'found footage' have scary music on it!? It completely ruins the realism of the film, and turns it into just another terrible Hollywood product.The twist ending was an absolute scream though. I laughed and laughed at its audacity. I loved it!So... yes, terrible horror movie. But entertaining if you're in it for the chuckles."
4,"Under rated. Good, but this ending is getting to be a cliche standard.","*SLIGHT SPOILERS*I am majoring in screen writing now and I've been noticing with movies like cloverfield, paranormal activity 1,2, and this movie, the endings are all the same. Cameraman dies....drops camera, possibly followed by a scare. I think this is personally not a good way of closing a movie, because it doesn't leave enough closure or explanation, so this better not really be the ""LAST exorcism"", because I have no clue what happened to that satanic group or fire demon they formed or the exorcist.The above is the only reason I took away a star, well that and the fact that the only action in the movie really comes about 3/4 of the way through...again, like those other movies. This movie is surely entertaining though and really, even though everybody tries to be a movie snob, entertainment is actually what movies are about. Sophistication comes second in my book. Yes, this movie will win no oscars, but it is still great."
1,Absolute Crap,"I just finished watching this stupid piece of crap movie and am so pissed that I can't get those 90 minutes back. This movie sucks! I am so tired of these documentary style movies, they have all SUCKED and this one is the king of them all. Do not waste your money. This movie is NOT scary. the acting sucks. the story sucks. the effects suck. Get the picture? Good, then don't get this one!"
1,Absolute Crap!!,"I viewed this thinking it was an actual movie but Its some bad cheap Imitation of ""Blair Witch Projet""the effects and plot so bad its laughable dont know how hollywood gave this one the green lightI can imagine how pissed off people where shelling, out bucks to see it in the theatureafter spending .50 cents renting it from Redbox, I still consider it to be a waste of money"
1,Disappointed,"I decided to watch this movie, because a friend at work said it scared her a few times... So I get home after work to watch this and it turns out the movie trailer was just as good as the actual movie, if not better...If you are looking forward to flushing your time and money down a toilet...then buy this movie."
2,More Funny Than Scary!!!,"I saw this with a friend, and we laughed the entire time because of how weird and crazy the plot line was. For the first half, it was just the preacher preaching. I felt like I was in Church. The girl didn't even seem possessed. She acted schizophrenic more than anything. The ending was a little twisted, but I promise not to ruin that. A Reverend from Baton Rouge, Louisiana named Cotton Marcus has been filming documentaries on how exorcisms are fake. He soon gets a letter from Louis Sweetzer who claims that his daughter, Nell is possessed by a demon. Will Reverend Cotton be able to save her? I probably wouldn't recommend THE LAST EXORCISM!!!"
2,Hated it.,"The first 97% of the movie was all right, but when they wrapped it up real quick at the end with ""a satanic cult did it all"" that ruined it for me. I imagine that real and true demonic possession occurs more often than ""satanic cults"" do. And I don't believe in possession.Throwing in a satanic cult is as bad as ending something with ""and then they woke up and it was all a dream""."
4,"Great movie, even if we've seen this plot device before.","If you're looking for a great, scary movie with interesting characters, you'll like this movie. The way the movie is structured is a little too ""Blair Witch"" for me, and it made me a little disappointed in the ending. That said, I really did enjoy most of this movie, and would recommend it."
4,Fascinating and Disturbing,"Great premise for a movie. Interesting, disturbing, and fascinating at the same time. This is the type of movie that stays with you days after you watch it."
1,Garbage,I didn't even make it through the first ten minutes...acting was bad and there was a low budget feel to it.
2,Meh...,"The poster says,""Refreshingly original"".This is false.While still having some creepy moments in it that kept the movie mildly entertaining, very little of this feature has originality.The flick is pretty much the bastard love child of 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Rosemarys baby'.I will admit that I was enjoying it untill the half assed shamalan-esque twist at the end. When that came about, I couldn't stop laughing. All I could think of was a bunch of old people sipping wine in a parlor room saying in bright friendly voices,""hail Satan!"", and I lost it.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone over 14 years old.TL;DR: If you can drive a car, smoke a cigarette, or drink a beer legally. Save your money for gas, smokes, or booze cause this movie is for children."
3,not bad not great,"The movie was just okay for me. It is definitely worthy of a rental, but I wouldn't have paid to see it in the theatre."
1,The Trailer is free,"This movie took long to get to the point & left us wondering at the end. That was good, but could have been more in the movie than questions it left the audience with. II (the sequel) should be better????"
2,The last 3 minutes DESTROY a fairly good film,"This is worth a rental and I saw it in the theater and was really enjoying it--until the final 3 minutes.No spoilers here, just a warning that the end of this movie is just dreadful. Also, MANY of the scenes in the trailer and shown in the poster do NOT occur in the film. The poster of her bent over backward---well, she bends over backwards, but not THAT far.And the poster with her on the ceiling? Never happens.Again, a rental that really delivers--until the end...."
3,Meanders and disappoints...,"What starts as an intriguing premise slowly degrades into a silly take on exorcism and religion. This is The Wicker Man rehashed-complete with a twist ending that is discouraging at best. Bell does a great turn as the victim, however Fabian's character is unlikable and hard to watch. You don't care about his journey. The ""documentary"" feel is OK, but doesn't add anything new here. Southern setting is helpful and creepy, but not enough to save this film. Watch only for Bell's performance, otherwise it simply doesn't achieve the level of fright that it promises."
1,BARDUS,"The Latin word BARDUS is defined as stupid, slow, dull. You can use anyone of these translations to describe this ""waste of celluloid"". I'm not wasting any more of my valuable time reviewing this piece of garbage."
2,Blair Witch rip off.,"First, I hate these Blair Witch type films. Just make a damn movie. The story idea was good. A con artist minister wants to make a documentry of himself doing one last exeorcism and expose himslef (No not that way) Good idea. Crappy film making. But the acting was pretty good. The girl was very good. she did creap me out."
2,"It Should Title ""The Lame Exorcist""","It's a Blair Witch Project wanna be. At least the Blair Witch Project has its originality. This hand-held home-video movie is a mixed soup of stolen ideas. It's not scary, and it's not original, what's left ?Not many people believe the storries in horror movies can actually happen anywhere. And not everyone believes in exorcism. But everyone would enjoy a good horror movie that packs with good story lines, great art and performance. This faux-documentary horror movie is is not it, it's really horrible !The cover looks complelling, and you might be compelled to spend $22 to buy it just to find out it's worth no more than $1 (to rent at the Redbox and avoid the ache of owning it).I give the movie plot 1 star, perfomance 3 stars, therefore 2 stars."
3,FILMED IN ST BERNARD PARISH!!!,"PLOT WAS OK, BUT I LOVED THE FACT THAT IT WAS FILMED IN ST BERNARD PARISH. ALOT OF LAND MARKS OF THE PARISH WAS WELL NOTED."
1,Just another Blair Witch or Cloverfield,"I hated Cloverfield and those style of movies. If you like those types of movies, you'll like this one. But personally, I couldn't stand those and wasn't aware this movie was like this before ordering. It is a first person, ""documentary"" style movie that likes to lead you to believe it is real.I think I would have liked this movie had it been directed differently, so my review is based soley on the directing style. The movie's story and settings were a good idea and could have made a decent ""normal"" movie."
1,What a jip!,"Horrible! Even for a low-budget horror flick, this movie leaves you hanging. Wait for it to come out on TV. No shocking moments and the lead character is completely unbelievable...AND A HORRIBLE ENDING! Leave it on the shelf...DONT BUY THIS MOVIE!"
2,CREATIVELY BANKRUPT,"This movie was such a let down. There was no creepiness at all.The scariest stuff in the movie was alot of neck bending and moaning.This could have been a decent movie with it's faux doucumentary style.An almost unnerving lack of scares and tension permeates the movie, with the uninspired script being suitably complemented by the insipid, leaden direction. The decision to cobble together `homages' to certain masterpieces serves to highlight how creatively bankrupt this project is. In particular, the representation of the possessed girl - complete with white frilly nightie, greasy hair, pivoting head and demonic voices spouting obscenities - is simply pathetic. It's a minor miracle that those Tubular Bells never start their distinctive chiming, although that was presumably down to clearance issues. To make matters worse, the climactic sequence in the woods is astoundingly similar to the ambiguous denouement of Blair Witch - including a near identical last shot. What a waste..."
2,Just not my style,I would not recommend this show to anyone; too much gore. They say I need nine more words so hopefully this fulfilled that requirement.
4,Fresh Take on Exorcism Genre,"First, let me say that I am not a fan of mockumentaries. The Devil Inside was pretty lame and I thought this one was going to be another exorcism movie set as a documentary. So I was pretty skeptical about this one and almost turned it off after the first 5-10 minutes of it. But the more I watched, the more of it started to come together and it actually turned out to be a really cool movie. The idea was original and thought it was well written. A lot of people complained about the ending, but I thought it was pretty damn cool, far fetched, maybe a little, but i thought it was pretty cool. I would recommend checking it out to any horror fan."
4,"Actually, Not Too Bad","I rented this when it first came out and recently watched it again for free on Amazon Prime.As long as you don't expect too much, it actually a pretty solid horror movie.Good characters, entertaining storyline, plenty of conflict and tension.If you're looking for a solid horror flick and can't find anything...give this a try.Just don't expect it to be a 'sequel' of or similar to the original.It's just kind of it's own, well made but somewhat low budget movie."
2,Don't bother with another faux documentary,"This movie had a good set-up and it ratcheted up tension as the main character realizes that his assumptions about ""what's going on"" are not correct. But it has has one of the most abrupt and worst endings I've ever seen in a film and one that is not earned in any way. Avoid it or see it as an example of how not to end a movie."
2,Movie,"It was a little irritating in the beginning ( I admit I did do some skipping over it all), but the story finally started taking shape. I can't say that I liked the portrayal and think the title is a little misleading, but that's only my opinion. The ending just didn't work for me. It was a surprise to be sure, and I won't give it away, but just not something I would watch again. I'm a huge horror movie fan, so I'm a little biased in rating these types of films."
4,Three in One!,"A combination of The Blair Witch Project, The Exorcist, and Rosemary's Baby, all in one movie!Being an independent movie with unknown actors, adds more to an authentic feeling of realism.Not at all what I expected - Very original.I LOVE the Ending!"
5,keeps you on your toes,This movie did the trick for my wife and I. This movie kept us on the edge of our seats for most of the time. If you like exorcism movies this will do the trick.
4,Don't watch tv.. it will rot your brain and keep you from enjoying life.,"Is it me or does a lot of the hating come from false expectations caused by advertising?I personally had never heard of the movie.. and only just came upon it tonight on amazon. Started out slow.. actually the whole movie takes its time.. but I was drawn into it by the middle and enjoyed it a lot. I typically don't care for ""horror"" movies since I don't like stupid cliches.. girlfriend does.. now that I think about it.. she went to bed before this was over."
2,Lacking,"The story was half-assed and it wasn't even quite scary or suspenseful. The only scenes that were slightly frightening were all in the end just like all those paranormal activity movies. I was disappointed. In fact, I watched it before and totally forgot I saw it because it wasn't even memorable. The trailer for the sequel looked good and I wanted to watch the original before the sequel but it wasn't worth my time (twice)."
1,The LAMEST Exorcism,This was really one of the lamest movies I have yet to see. They filed it a la Blair Witch and it's ending was even worse.
3,Was ok...kinda choppy...coulda did a better ending...,"Overall I gave this movie a 3. Not much for the documentary camera type movies. It was choppy but the theme was good and somewhat twisted. Didn't care for the ending to much. Anyway, hope this review helps..."
2,Pretty good until the end,"I enjoyed this movie. Showing how exorcists can be frauds and showmen. Good twists and actually started to feel for the characters, until the end of the movie. Completely lost me, and turned me off. Hated the ending."
2,Ugg... Really?,"This movie was absolutely horrible. I'm still trying to figure out why a ""shoulder cam"" movie has mood music. The shakey camera movies have been done to death since mid 2000. The story was cookie-cutter with an almost carbon-copy ""Blair Witch"" ending. Save your money, or, if you're curious just rent it to save yourself a few."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"This movie was a waste of time & $$$ when I went to go see it at the movie theater. I wouldn't recommend it to buy it, instead go rent it from REDBOX."
2,NOT WHAT I SAW IN THEATER,"This was a really really good movie in the Theaters for Scarefeast ... NOT sure what IMAGE is doingbut WHY WHY WHY would you RELEASE a version that was different then the theater , The Blu Ray isRATED the DVD is the Uncut Version I saw in theater WHY would you not make the same or includeboth versions I even wrote to ask why and Never got a email back ... Ummmmmmm"
1,Buggiest Program I Ever Encountered,"I echo the comments of the previous reviewer. I am Treasurer for our church. We previously were using Membership Plus 6.0 and we upgraded. After almost five months of trying to use it, I have reverted to the version 6.0 until I find a totally new product. That's right - even after investing the money in this product, we are abandoning any further efforts to use it. There are many features that just do not work - there are frequent error messages (including during backup), and the company only offers free support for 30 days. My opinion though is that this software is so buggy that the data is unreliable. I would have rated it with 0 stars if that had been an option."
1,Should never have been released,"Allow me to add my disappointment to the other reviewers. We have been attempting to upgrade from Membership Plus 6 for two months, with little success in input and none in reporting. The canned reports are full of bugs, as is the rest of the package. Unedited operating system errors are generated from ordinary operations like changing a date range. Stay Away!"
1,OH MY,I purchased this product loaded it on the computer and then the fun began. WHAT A NIGHTMARE this has been. when I try to print a tax deductable receipt in one members name I have to shut down the program then come back to it in order to go on to the next member. It is constantly making me restart the whole computer because it freezes everything up. I have had to even unplug the computer on a few occasions to get away from it. It is a waste of money. I am looking for another program of this type.. Any Ideas anyone???????????DFarley
1,DISAPPOINTED,DOES NOT SMELL THE SAME AS OTHER PERFUME BOTTLES I OWN NOW OF SAME SCENT ...THE SPRAY CAP IS BENT...
5,Incredible deal,"On the product's website, this sells for $36. The book alone is $12.99 on AMZN, so you see why this is a steal! It's has about everything someone would need to travel, even locally. I'm taking it on my trip to France as just the blister supplies (feet) will make it worth bringing.I'm sure these will sell out fast, so get 1 or 2 now."
4,Decent little weekender for the money,"I purchased the kit to have a smaller, lighter kit for short outings. I think it's a good compromise between the bare essential gram weenies kits that have a butterfly and two aspirin, and those of us (like me) who think every overnight trip is fraught with peril and pack the clotting agent and epi-pens :). The basics for bumps, blisters, and cuts are included. Not much in the way of larger dressings, but let's face it- How many times do you need a trauma pad while on a weekend jaunt? The included manual is packed with practical field information that is useful for all, even city-trained EMS professionals. IMO, The manual and adds significant value to the kit."
1,A BLAST FROM THE PAST...nicely done!,"THIS WAS 5-STARS....but it didn't print out that way for some reason!!I was happy to get this cd, being a Beatles fan and all. While you won't find any of these songs in the top 40, they will stick with you and perhaps it's because it was well recorded. At the used price, you will have one heck of a bargain. Get it now, because other cd's have long since disappeared from the market place and are as scarce as hens teeth. Don't say I haven't warned ya, in a few short years you'll be paying plenty for this recordingThe opening salvo of ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" gets you going just like the Beatles version. ""Twenty Flight Rock"" is a joy to hear and ""Cycle Song"", if for nothing else, is funny. For under 10 bucks, you will be playing this cd over again, bringing you back to the early days of the Beatles before they were the Beatles. If you are thinking scratchy, cavern-type recordings, think again. This was recorded with modern in mind. Well done, fellas!"
1,Disappointed with Kelty 2.5,"I was very disappointed with this product, as well as the two other versions (2.1 and 3.1) that we tried. Way too bulky and heavy - not at all what I expected based on other reviews and research I did online. My child did not like it at all either - uncomfortable in the crotch area and my childs legs got banged up on the pieces of metal on the base of the carrier. Funny that nothing I read mentioned that there were strips of metal on the bottom, which I guess are supposed to make if more sturdy and sit on the ground easier. Who knows. Anyway, they hurt my child's legs. We returned this item, but also had some difficulty because the seller claimed they never received any of the emails I sent to them through Amazon."
5,Outstanding series - Check Amazon Auctions,Space 1999 was an outstanding series. Since this release is no longer available check the Amazon Auctions and search Space 1999 for items.
5,All the episodes will be one hell of a collection to have.,Since I was a young child I watched Space 1999 every week until they cancelled the show. A couple of years ago they show up on Sci-fi channel and I started recording the shows then they cancelled showing the episodes. I look forward to the episodes being available to the public on VHS Tapes or DVD. One hell of a show!!!
3,Simple but interesting,"After watching a program on the History Channel about the prediction of the future of the earth and in particular the date December 21, 2012, I purchased this book because the program implied that I Ching had, by its method, predicted a world-changing event on that date. This particular book was a fast read -- more like a reference guide. It was simple and probably a good read for those who are not familiar with I Ching. I purchased 2 other books with the same subject. I have not read them yet because this book bored me and did not do what I had expected it to do."
3,Divination use only,"I mostly read the I Ching for wisdom purposes and don't intend to use it for divination. I kept hearing how this book simplified many of the aspects of the hexagrams and made the I Ching extremely readable and after breezing through the pages, I have to agree that it presents the I Ching in an extremely simple matter.But here's what I don't like: this book is for divination purposes only. Hardly any of it has to do with the wisdom of the book but instead focuses on what you need to do when you read a certain hexagram; the passages always say ""do this"" and ""don't do that"".I would hate to give it a three star rating because its purpose isn't parallel to how I read the I Ching. However, if you want to use the I Ching for divination purposes, then buy this book."
2,Not A Good Sequel,"The Art of War II: BetrayalThis one is about half as good as the original which I gave 4 stars. Snipes is as good as he always has been but I think poor writing and direction were where this one fell down. Lots of killing, lots of Snipes bravado, etc but I only purchased it because I hoped that it would be close to the first one which is very good."
1,Really bad movie - don't even rent it!,Can't believe anyone can find something good to say about this movie. Acting is wooden and its a formula script. Woman co star is terrible and Wesley Snipes -- if this is the best he can do he should stay in prison to protect the rest of us from future bad movies. This is such a stinker of a movie. I liked his blade movies but this is not in that league.
2,"interesting repertoire, a bit plain","I'm a big fan of Clementi sonatas, and more pianists have been wonderfully including them in the recital programs recently. This recording, while clean and well played, falls flat. I miss the vibrancy of some of the passages, the humor, the drama. This recording is good to get to know the Clementi sonatas, but this does not to full justice to the much underrated composer."
4,Excellent Overview of Overlooked Eastern Front in WWI,"I enjoyed reading ""Victory in the East"" which effectively covers the little-known fighting on the Eastern Front in WWI.This book by Michael Kihntopf fills in the blanks and even goes into the fighting that took place after the Armistice ending hostilities on the Western Front. Most other accounts if they even mention the Eastern Front focus only on the Battle of Tannenburg which took place very early on in East Prussia.Place names in Russia familier from Napoleonic or WWII battles appear in this account. We learn that the Germans advanced almost as far into Russia in WWI as they did in WWII.Unfortunately the rather crude maps make it difficult to follow the descriptions at times which is why I am docking the book one star."
3,interesting and different,"much better than the 2nd one. very strange type of movie, that made it interesting. recommend to 18 yrs and up"
1,The Human Centipede,After 40 plus years of watching horror this is by far the worst ever. The rating does not go low enough. I would rate this stupid movie -10
2,Geewiz who thinks of this stuff,"Caught this on netflix. This is certainly not the most grousome movie ever made. Im guessing this was a book that didnt translate well to the screen. Budget constraints definitly held back the full scope of the horror this movie could have possessed. If you liked hostile you could get into this. Not the greatest horror movie ever made even for an independant but what kept me going, I have to keep asking myself who in the hell thinks of this stuff and why?Movie kinda dragged along till the Dr explained to the victims what he was planning to do to them. My jaw dropped. I had to rewind and rewatch it a few times. I couldnt even believe someone would think like this. Insanity. Id give a movie like hostile an A for effort and story but this I would give an A for story but very poorly carried out. They need to do a remake and do it right."
5,FANTASTIC,"The human centipede is unlike anything i've ever seen before,i thought a long time on how to describe it or what movie to compare it with but for me it stands for itself,one of the best movies i have ever seen"
5,Super acting all around!,"Yes this movie's tailer went total viral and got lot's of attention. but It really did live up to and surpassed my expections, mostly because the actors were awesome and really committed to this very uncomfortable project. Great attention to detail by the director as well, some very good tongue in cheek(hehe) comedy as well. I can't believe the reviews complaining about buget constraints, this movie was made with 6 actors and 3 million euros, that's nothing these days, I respected the producer and directors creativity in making this movie without a bunch of money or special effects. ""why make a human centepede?"" you ask... research why serial killers actually kill,, or why surgeons become surgeons (drs are sick f*x!) It's all about control, and sexual fetish. this movie is going to change the whole genre!"
4,Twisted,"I think in order to really like this movie you have to be creatively twisted. Although this movie is NOTHING like ""black swan"" or ""martyrs"" if you enjoyed those movies you should enjoy this one. The movie is very sick and twisted. At points flat out gross but I enjoyed it because it was different unlike your average torture porn horror flick. No one can say they would have predicted that ending or last 30 minutes for that matter. Six is creative and truly demented. Most films don't have a point these days and this one was no different but movies are for entertainment and six delivers. Like I said it takes a certain kind of person to enjoy this movie."
1,Oh Please,"Ya, I say to this ""film?"" eat sh__. Ha Ha . No in all honesty this was just plain stupid. The acting was sub-par, The idea was just too idiotic and gross. Plot - oh I guess there was one, pretty below b type. All in all I would say do not watch unless you want to have some very funky and yes yucky visions in your head, not good, Not worth it, it could be disturbing and not in a fun way."
1,This is a film about physical and psychological torture.,"I was intrigued by the title of this movie, so I started watching. In no time at all, my interest turned to pure disgust. This movie is merely a torture-fest. I watched it for about 30 minutes until my nerves were raw and I turned it off. If you like to see people tortured and mutilated, go for it! Otherwise, skip it and run in the other direction."
1,A one star rating is too generous,"Yeah, it's some idea of horror, but talk about a waste of time. This movie seems to hit a niche audience, but to describe it plainly, it is flat disgusting. Nothing more."
1,Human Centipede HD,Slow and boring. The plot made no sense and went nowhere fast. The end could not have come any faster.
1,complete depravity,This was one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. I wanted to see it after reading how horrible it was. Morbid curiosity I guess. I wish I didn't watch this movie. I feel so filthy down to my soul. You have to have no soul to watch this movie. Its not scary.....its just complete depravity...I'm do sorry I ever started it.
2,Couldn't Believe What I was Watching...,"Leave it to the Europeans to think up new perversions; new ways of out-grossing each other out. Oy!Aside from being completely illogical and medically impossible, it took a powerful amount of imagination to come up with this story. I give it one star more than it's worth for sheer audacity.Acting was about as hammy as could be; the crazed doctor was a cross between Hogan's Heroes and Schindler's List.Watch at your own risk. Nightmares may ensue..."
1,This doesn't need to exist,"There are movies that are ""so bad they are good"" and there are movies that are just bad.This movie is just bad.The plot is a contrived excuse to show disgusting garbage on screen.The special effects are not good enough to watch on their own, they are bleh at best.Even if you can stomach getting past the disgusting concept of this movie there is nothing here to enjoy.If you wanted a fun gore movie, this is not it. It's just gore porn, and not even good gore porn."
3,My expectations were too high,"This movie was described to me as one of the most disturbing horror movies ever and even the most desensitized person has to turn away from certain scenes. Uhh...the most disturbing scene in the movie is when the crazy doctor is describing the procedure. That's pretty much it. After they were all joined together I was left thinking ""Ok...what now?"" Pretty much, we get to see the human centipede walking around in the yard and the doctor trying to get it to carry a newspaper. And then some cops show up and the movie is soon over. There's not a whole lot of story here. Like WHY make a human centipede in the first place?One of the members of the centipede is a Japanese man. Why oh why did he have to be the guy in the front? He yells and screams in Japanese the whole time. I just wanted him to shut up."
3,Stupid Women Strike Again,"Every idiotic female messup must be in this film. A. Women can change tires. B. Drinking a roofie? Really? C. When you are trying to escape, using the telephone that is right in front of your face is probably the best plan. Call the frigging police. D. If you want to wake up someone who is unconscious, focus on the fierce Japanese guy rather than dragging your unconscious girlfriend up the stairs and halfway across the lawn. E. Wasting your time trying to wake up anethesized people is probably not going to work. Try running."
1,Death of human dignity....heed the warnings of those who disliked it.,"There is NOTHING in this movie that is art. I would honestly question the heart and minds of the people who enjoyed this movie. I'm no moral police and ""believe to each their own"" but the kind of person who would enjoy this movie, publicly or privately, I could not be friends with. I'm no bible thumper nor do I believe in any religion, but this movie is offensive to the highest degree. I knew what to expect visually and the plot. It is all about the destruction of the characters' humanity. I can handle gore and horror but this.....I am sick to my stomach of this. I have never thought once in my entire life time of something that is truely obscene. I can no longer say that. I'm not going to call in the censor police, but if there was ever a moment where for the good of the community where something should be banned, it is this movie.Goodbye to Manos, Hands of Fate as the worst movie ever produced."
3,FEED HER! FEEEEEEED HER!,"So I thought ""Hey, I want to see a different movie. I wonder if there's anything I can stream for free.""How I ended up with The Human Centipede, I can't really say.It's not so gratuitous as to be an hour of gore gross-out, but at the same time, it's perhaps more over-the-top than one would expect from a movie that apparently wants to be taken a bit seriously. The pacing of the movie is actually pretty respectable from a development standpoint, but it seems near the last 20 minutes that someone said ""Okay, let's wrap this up"" and plot devices come at you rapidly.Despite being mostly in English, this may be one of the most stereotypically German movies ever."
2,Overrated Junk,I was told this was one of the best horror movies made. In my oppinion it was just a hyped up version of saw that was very drug out. I should have downloaded it for free.
3,It made me quirm a little...To me this is horror not Dracula,"The Doctor was casted perfectly and as one review listed very cold. Kinda creative actually, well not the girls walking thru the woods I would have personally drove the car on busted tires but I would've ended up at the Dr.'s place too...With movies likes this you are typically compelled to kick the screen when the actor does something stupid hence the 3 stars and not 4. Entertaining on a creepy level with a cold ending."
1,I threw up.,"This was the worse movie I have ever seen. If you want to puke, this is a perfect laxative. Do not watch!!! It had no plot...no good outcome at all. HORRIBLE and DISGUSTING. WAY TOO MUCH!!!!"
1,Pick another movie seriously...,Movie was all around terrible. The ending made me want to call the producer of the movie and ask for compensation of my wasted time. It contain some unnecessary nudity. TO EMPHASIZE ONCE MORE...the ending is ridiculous...I could have written a better ending. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! Pick another movie!
1,horrible,"This is with out a doubt the most horrible movie Idea out there , complete waste of time to watch .."
1,horrible,"just stupid, that's about all i can say. No story, no sub-context, nothing. The only way you could like this movie is if you get a sick thrill out of seeing three people sewn together."
1,What a waste of time,"Normally even bad movies have some element of campy ... humor ... or just something that you can appreciate. This was absolutely a waste of my time. The movie script, premise ... well was a bad joke. The acting ... I think even Ed Woods would have fallen asleep or walked out on. If your curious .. go ahead and give it a watch ... but it's really and truly not worth it.I gave it a one star because I couldn't deduct stars ... like say a minus 5 star rating would have been generous."
4,Different,"I watched this movie out of curiosity and it burned images into my mind. It is hypnotic, gross, extremely gross, original, gut wrenching and amazing. It has a new 'monster' which is quite a feat given the number of horror movies out there today. It also has a mad scientist and unwitting victims and a secluded 'laboratory'. All the traditional cliches... reworked into this gruesome creation.I haven't reacted this way to a movie since I was very young... but it actually appalled me. Others have gone over the plot so I won't do that. But I will say that this is most definitely an original worth looking at if you are a die hard horror movie fan. Not for the feint of heart and not for those who get grossed out easily. Kudos to originality!"
1,A movie from a human idiot!,"Love low-budget horror films, and I enjoyed horror porn films like Bad Biology. But The Human Centipede is a waste! The movie was slow moving, the actors do not know how to act, and this moving was not gross at all. Don't know what's the big deal about this movie when we don't see anything graphic in the film. Three people connected to one another releasing waste, so what! Like I said love hardcore horror films that push the limits, this movie did not. Tom Six get over yourself you're not that hardcore. The Human Centipede will not gross you out, but it'll bore you to death!"
2,Never saw it.,"I never intended to see this movie, but then Daniel Tosh of Tosh.0 did such a hilarious spoiler of the film, that I had to watch, [...] . If you still watched it after this expecting to see something scary or saw it before this, as in, in-theater, you are an idiot."
2,Entertaining,"All you can do is laugh during this movie, its so insane. Stranded girls decide its a good idea to let the guy they ask for help know that nobody knows where they are and BAM!, next thing you know its off to surgery. An ending that leaves you hanging, nothing redeeming, but then again, what would you expect from ""Human Centipede"". South Park's ""Human Cent-I-Pad"" was funnier, but this was up there. Not something I'd watch alone because if someone saw you they'd probably question your moral character LOL"
2,Sick and pointless.,"Wow. Wow. If you feel like being disturbed tonight rent this, lock up the kids. Basically sewing people together and connecting all their organs. Yes. ""Yes, feed her, feed her."" Sick and disturbed."
2,watch at your own risk,"I'm no movie critic, and I usually can stand up to blood and guts, and most movies don't really scare me. However, this movie I had a hard time watching, i was so disturbed that at a point in time after eating I couldn't eat, and at times I couldn't do other things. I had a hard time getting over the gruesome nature of the film, and at times I still think about it and still get a little freaked out and sick. I would say, watch at your own risk."
1,"Lame, lame and more lame","When I first heard about this film, I was so excited. It sounded different, unique, sick and twisted; definitely my kind of film. Well, let me tell you, after seeing the film, I was beyond disappointed. There is absolutely nothing sick and twisted about this film, nor was there anything disturbing or scary about it, at least in my opinion.The acting is terrible and the girls and so annoying. The Japanese guy tries his best and does slightly better. The German doctor is pretty strange and creepy, which is why you can't understand why or how the rest of the movie happens.Definitely a lame film; total snooze fest. Don't bother with this one."
1,"I thought it was a Hostel-like movie, very wrong","Dont watch this movie, if you're looking for a scary movie to watch, just get REC or REC 2. I like scary movies and they are usually bad but entertaining, this was neither. Dont waster your time or money."
1,Horrible and pointless,"I just don't get how anyone could see value in a movie like this. It's not just disturbing, which I can handle, but it seems totally pointless with no redeeming qualities. I normally don't write reviews, but this was so bad that I just had to add my two cents."
1,Simply Suxs Ass!,"This movie is horrible. Not bad atmophere and dread till the so called ""experiment"" then it simply becomes a laugh riot. Nothing scary and if you wanna watch just to be grossed out...there are so many more better and sicker films out there. Skip this piece of garbage. 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back."
3,Pretty Good but not great,"Yes you do see beautiful naked women and an original story line. In the film, the pain in the characters is hinted at but not in your face, part 2 to this movie is very immersive. In the sequel to this film it is actually hard to watch. I suggest to watch both films, as if done by two different producers all together. This movie is pretty good, but recommended for the backstory to the follow up. Then it all makes sense. As a pair............A masterpiece!!"
3,Pretty Tame All Things Considered IMO,"Do yourselves a favor and skip to 14 minutes in, all you'll miss is a guy sitting in a car looking at pictures of dogs sniffing each others butts and the 2 girls being bitchy when their rental car gets a flat tire... on second thought just go 21-22 minutes in I don't think the ""human centipede"" even is created till 40 minutes in.Without spoiling it, here's pretty much the real deal. I don't think this movie should have been rated higher then PG-13, there's very little violence aside from 2 shootings, a couple of stabbing, biting, a few teeth being pulled and a suicide. No real nudity aside from the rare an infrequent partial breast shot and old mans backside in one scene. No sex or even the implication there of. I guess people are more disturbed by what's implied or the concept it's self.Personally, I though it was tame and found myself laughing allot since I recently saw the South Park spoof of it."
3,Not for the weak or the young (It's Sick),"WARNING: This movie is NOT for under 18. I would not suggest this movie for anyone. I happened across this movie some time ago. I love European movies so it caught my attention. This movie is not horror but gore. I would not watch it twice. I doubt any German scientist would stoop this low to perform such an act. Our society begs for more and more of such indecencies. I just pray this movie doesn't cause other sick minds to try and repeat these acts.Recommend not watching this movie, but if you have to, make sure the kids are in bed. Our kids are shown enough violence and sick filth. No need to propagate this craziness."
3,Not sure what to say!,"I rented this with fairly low expectations...I mean, when you read what the film is about, you pretty much know what to expect, right? Gross, creepy, freaky. Not the feel-good hit of the year. I was irritated by the girls in the first few minutes of the film, and was relieved when they found their way to the creepy doctor's home, just so they'd stop their bickering. I was intrigued by the character of the doctor; he was quite creepy-looking, and played his part pretty well. However, in the end the movie felt pretty thin...more of a curiosity than a horror film, and I was left wondering who came up with this idea, and how they managed to get the funding to make it. I read about the second film in the series, and I have no desire to see it--it sounds like they just tried to make it even grosser, but with even less of a point than this one."
2,BAD MOVIE!,"This movie was very tasteless and i cant believe i watched it all the way thru, but i had to see how it ended. I may be slightly demented for wanting to see it in the first place! I would not recommend this movie to anyone PERIOD!"
1,Don't waste your time. All Hype.,"This movie wasn't disgusting and nasty (like I'd hoped.) This movie wasn't ""jump-out of your seat"" scary (like I'd hoped.) This movie wasn't thought provoking or interesting (like I'd hoped.) And finally, this horror movie wasn't even the least bit humorous (like I would have settled for.) It's amazing how much hype has been made over this movie, and in addition, how many sales this movie has made. Don't waste your money. This movie is a waste of money, even to rent. Seems like it may have potential in the first few minutes, but the rest of the time you're sitting there bored out of your mind, waiting and hoping for something to happen, and fighting off the urges to simply fall asleep. Probably the worst movie since ""13 Going on 30."""
1,Not My Cuppa,"While I enjoy ""bad"" movies from time to time, particularly those in the horror genre, this was just... Well, not. At least, it wasn't in the sense of most ""bad"" horror flims. It had potential to be interesting, but it just fell flat. The script was all but nonexistent, and what WAS said was bland. The characters were equally so, constantly making idiotic and cliched decisions, and not to mention annoying, and as for the plot...Boring. There's no other way to describe it. I ended up fast forwarding it a good portion of the time because it was too predictible. I finally stopped it half-way through just to see what the human centipede would look like. And yes, it is disturbing to think of someone doing this, but that's the only thing that did disturb me. The movie itself... Well, it was lacking. All in all, it just wasn't for me.KST."
5,A unique experience,"Although quite disturbing at some points, I quite enjoyed the movie as a whole! I'm glad that someone has decided to break away from conventional horror films and finally make something a little more intriguing and different! Being 100% medically accurate, this could very well happen to any one of us if there's someone insane enough, like Dr. Laser, to perform it. That's a chilling thought. This made a wonderful horror film."
2,Really??,I'm a fan of horror movies but this was not. It was not scary. It was not brilliant. It was disgusting. I should have known better.
4,Worth the watch,"The movie itself is great and all, but not as disturbing and gory as everyone built it up to be. So I was let down in that way only."
1,worst movie,"no point, no fun, lame lame lame lame lame. people who like it think it is clever. if you know anything about movies you know this is wholly unoriginal and 100% pointless. even the color of the film is bad. don't add to it's revenue!"
3,Um...lol,Very interesting strange movie. Kinda gross. Not sure how to explain it any further. Kinda wacko. Not for faint of heart because of the descusting nature but it's not as descusting as two. If you thought this one was sick...do not watch the second one lol
3,Idea for Twilight Zone,This to me was more of a Twilight Zone movie. The idea was good but I feel the acting wasn't that great. I must say that it felt like I was watching my soaps on a Friday and have to wait until Monday just to know what is going on. I wanted to see what happens next once it ended so to part 2 now.
2,I love horror movies...this movie wasn't as extreme as I expected.,"From everything I'd heard, I thought this movie would be really ""out there"". It wasn't. I didn't give it two stars because I think it's bad - it just didn't entertain me. It wasn't really bad or good, it just was. The quality was great and the acting was top notch. The story was odd, but not really...considering that it was about a lunatic. It was slow and somewhat boring. In my opinion, the movie was tame enough that it could have been an episode of House or CSI. Sybil, Misery, I Spit on Your Grave, Saw (pick one), The Girl Next Door = these are a few movies are a little disturbing and hard to watch at times."
3,not bad,A slow melting letdown that lacked immagination but still managed to be grose enough for me to finish watching. It was kinda funny in a sick twisted way.
3,"Yes, behind the horror is a real-life metaphor.","As I peeled back the layers of shock horror, gore, and torture from this film, I quickly discovered it is a veiled commentary describing the inhumane treatment and scientific tests Nazi doctors and scientists conducted on the Jews before and during WWII. The dehumanization performed by the German, yes, German doctor parallels the same treatment given to the unfortunate Jews in and around Germany during that horrific period. It removes the buffer between non-Jews (who weren't afflicted by baseless genocide) and the chosen ones, instead inserting two Western (American) young women. With this switch, the audience can now experience the villainy only felt warmly before in history books and televison programs. Overall, this genre is not one I personally enjoy...but if you like horror/torture movies, the ending will successfully complete a well-made and acted movie. Please do not allow anyone under 18 to watch it, though."
1,"Don't watch, brings out the worst!!!","Don't watch this movie, this is probably the first movie I've ever seen that I think I lost a part of my humanity. I really wouldn't call this movie entertainment, its sadistic and cruel. This movie wouldn't even be characterize as creepy, its just inhuman."
1,Not For The Horror Connoisseur,"This movie was definitely made for a very small segment. Most will not enjoy this film as if the vast one star ratings where not an indicator. This film is best summed up as a ""cinnamon challenge"""
1,Just wanted to add the 1 star rating.,"Was interested in seeing this film, but did not want to waste my time or end the movie feeling like the scum of the Earth for watching it. Hence I read reviews and watched the trailer. Do not waste your time--people shouldn't get money for making a film like this."
2,Curiosity satisfied,"All the hype had piqued my curiosity about The Human Centipede and the way audiences were so divided over it. I suspected I would fall into the negative camp so was glad to see it among the free offerings for Amazon Prime members.In short -- this is fetish porn masquerading as a horror movie. If torture, coprophagy and Nazi imagery are your thing, look no further."
1,The Human Centipede Review,"There's really nothing else to the ""3 people sewed together to make a centipede"" Story. The cast is unlikeable and dumb at best. It's not subtle at all. The villian is 1D and phoned in a mile away. Infact,The villian's plan is stupid and he has nothing good to gain from this. All the movie does is waste time by having pointless filler moments. Overall:like Hostle,a bad movie that has no real horror and relies on the hype of it's gore which is overblown. I give this film -0 out of 10."
1,poo,"unrealistic and amateur... the motivation was never explained... why the dogs? why the random killing of the truck driver? The only thing I saw was people eating each others' crap and dying, kinda like this movie! not scary, not funny, not... just not!"
2,That was a disturbing 2 hours,"Europeans can do creepy even better than the asians.This is more distorted than your average western horror, and my girlfriend only lasted until the first bowel movement before departing the scene. Some people would consider the imagery sexual, I found the movie very darkly comedic in sections.Worth a gander, only drawback again is human stupidity which is a staple ingredient in this kind of flick."
3,Obscene Ridiculousness,"WTF. Crazy, perversely funny, schlocky, gross ... just damn weird. Sounds more disgusting than it is due to the blessed restraint in gross-out effects. A Frankenstein for the Saw generation. You'll groan more than you shiver and laugh more than you'll shriek, but it is definitely one of those ""if you haven't seen it, you'll wish you had"" kind of films. Most of the ""horror"" comes more from the kinkiness of the whole affair. Certainly a different way to spend an hour and a half."
1,Disgusting,"I was initially pretty curious given the title... but after watching it, it has to be the worst movie I've seen. Just totally disgusting for no point, major gaps in logic errors... etc.. To write anymore would involve me having to remember it... would rather not."
1,Sick,"It is very disturbing that someone would make a movie like this and somehow got the money to make it. But what I find more disturbing is that people would willingly pay money to see such a film, buy the DVD or rent it. And some of this people give this film a good rating. There is something seriously wrong with the human race. If you willingly watched this film or just want to, then I don't want to know you. As for the guy who made this movie and the sequel (!) I hope karma catches up with him quickly. Sick beyond belief. There is no justification for a movie like this. No wonder so many horrible things go on in this world. Any decent human being would be repulsed by this and never even watch it."
2,;0/,"This is no blood or gore horror movie but it's sick in so many ways. It's call human centipede need I say more, the concept and seeing it it grosses out your mind to the 10th level, and the doctor look soooooooooooooo creepy like really creepy the way he look talk act. The acting was ok but the concept was crazy. When I'm watching i keep thinking what if one of them poop,pee or try to get up and run, it made my skin crawl.PS: I wouldn't recommend watching this move and eating at least if you are stop eating towards the middle."
1,yuck,Seriously sick movie. I wish I could UN-see it. Just thinking about it makes me gag. I would avoid this unless you want some really nasty image in your head.
1,It doesn't make sense,"The movie is boring...the way the surgeon did the surgery to create a supposedly ""human centipede"" is just obviously absurd. I love watching thriller/horror/suspense movies and this one is one of the ""worst horror movie"" i've ever seen..I would rather waste my time watching Slither or See No Evil than this crap!"
2,Bizarre Premise Realized Clumsily,"I'll give the film makers credit for an incredibly bizarre premise, however the movie ultimately disappoints.Is it shocking? At times. Does it gross one out? I suppose. Is there a real satisfying twist, and or resolution? Sorry, for me, no. Certainly if you're looking for a bit of 'torture porn' or out and out weirdness, this flick may deliver for you, but if real scares and spine chilling fright are your goals - look somewhere else.Lead actors are good - most notably the sick doctor and the Japanese ""centipede"" head - but the material is so straight forward, to the point of predictability, that I found myself wishing for the end credits merely to alleviate my boredom.I've heard a sequel is in the works. The Human Millipede perhaps? Ugh."
1,"If you read this, don't say you weren't warned. The WORST movie EVER (period).","If you read this, don't say you weren't warned. The WORST movie EVER (period). I can't believe this movie is actually a movie. I hate the movie so bad that I actually view it on Netflix a couple months back. And when I came across the title on Amazon I had to take the time out of my day to make sure I do what ever it took to bash this movie. (Yes, it is that bad). If you cursed yourself to watched this movie after reading this review than good for you. Listen to this review and don't watch the movie, it will do you justice."
1,Truly putting the Horror in Horrible,"If your looking to have the crap scared out of you, this is it. The stuff of nitemares and once you watch it that's it. It's in your head."
2,I saw this movie at a swap meet:,"And decided to check it out online and after reading the reviews I might pass it by because after all George W.anker Bush said that: ""The United States of America does not torture people"" but we all know now that that that is a complete and total lie and has been for quite some time, we also know that soldiers used his book called Decision Points for toilet wiping paper because they know where he lied in the book and he belongs in prison for it."
1,stinko p o s,whoever made this pos should be put in jail shame on you this film sucks we must stop human centepde 2 from happening tom six should be ashame i think he is a freak no john carpenter he isnt and is just as sick as rob zombie another freako who shouldnt be allowed to ruin the halloween series say no to tom six and rob zombie and to any feature human centepde movies
3,South Park!,This was gross and funny. I had to watch it because South Park had a new episode on Wednesday called Human SCENTiPad. I guess this is where the idea came from because it was the same thing - Steve Jobs had three people stitched together. I alternated between laughing out loud and going eewww! I wouldn't have paid for it though.
1,WTF,This has to be the most messed up movie I have ever heard about let alone seen. I can't believe this was made
2,Meh,"I have seen better, more disturbing horror films. The claim ""Medically Accurate"" is a misnomer. Issues of tissue rejection, infection plus the subjects potentially dying from shock from what (theoretically) would be a very long and complicated series of operations. The story goes off the rails pretty early."
1,Snuff film for today's scum,"If you thought this movie was good, that makes you what used to be called ""a bad person"". Easy enough to review. Anyone who enjoys a movie whose only point is to watch people suffer as their humanity is stolen from them is scum. The director and all the people involved in this movie should be shunned."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time!!!!!!!,"This movie sucked!!! I don't even know why I watched it to begin with. It's kinda like a train wreck, you know you shouldn't watch but you just have to. Well, I did that and boy did I regret that! The acting sucks and the whole story line is just stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible movie ever made!!!,Not worth your time to watch unless its free and still it isn't completely worth it. It's not scary or suspenseful at all this movie isn't anything but horrible.
1,Testament of nasty author and director...,"This movie is a testament of not just the author but also of the movie director's worst case scenario of anal retention gone bad. How perverse is the plot; then how perverse it the director for taking on the story line to convert it into a movie. Not meant for human consumption. Glad that it was not one that I purchased and then regretted. I skimmed through it on netflix. Shame on netflix for posting it, and it really shouldn't be marketed for purchase here on Amazon. Extremely gross and repulsive. Deserves a minus 5 rating."
1,Really lame,This is not even scary for supposed horror movie. Just the product of a really sick mind. The whole concept is implausible by any stretch of the imagination.
1,"If This Is Where Horror Is Going, I'm Pulling The Plug","Turgid film that really has nothing to recommend it as a mad doctor preys on the unsuspecting for his sick and I do mean SICK experiments.Another so-called modern horror for the trash bin.For those who enjoyed films like Salo, to everyone else this film is YUCK.Warning: This film is gross and disgusting."
2,You can watch this movie on FAST FORWARD and STILL not miss a thing!,I can see why it was never in theaters and why I never knew about this movie until someone told me about it. I can't believe that they're actually making a third one. Seriously??? it wasn't even scary. I literally skipped/zipped through 75% of the movie and STILL don't feel as if I missed anything.
1,All Around Bad Movie,"I had the house to myself, it was stormy out, and I was in the mood for a good horror flick. Unfortunately, I chose this piece of crap. It's not horrifying, frightening, gory or even thought provoking. It's just a sad attempt at being offensive. And, because the filmmakers were so over the top and blatant in their attempt to make an offensive film, they didn't even pull that off. It ended up being laughable (not humorous) and pathetic."
1,Horrible,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I didn't feel fear just pity for the poor victims. The concept is stupid. No doctor, however insane he is would think the cruel experiment could ever be successful. Avoid. Don'y give this crappy franchise any of your money."
1,Do Not Watch This Movie-- It's Bad for Your Mind!,"I repeat: Do Not Watch This Movie-- It's Bad for Your Mind!It looks like a stupid mad scientist/slasher film-- until the premise is revealed in the first 20 minutes.I am no prude, and no stranger to the bizarre, or a good horror movie.This film is an outright abomination, and I turned it off right after the premise was revealed. I wasn't willing to pollute my mind with this twisted trash and I hope you won't, either."
3,Gag,"I was in awe when I watched this movie. I wouldn't call it horror, I would call it a shock movie. Then again, if it were a true story I'd bet the victims would call it horror. You know the drill, rain, car trouble, stranded, sadistic and twisted mad scientist who has a poopy fetish...blah blah blah. I was disgusted throughout this entire movie. I was on the edge of my seat and found myself gagging and covering my mouth on numerous occasions. If disgust is what the filmmaker set out to accomplish then he did his job well. If you like films about torture this one is for you. Do yourself a favor and do not eat anything chocolate while watching this movie."
2,it's only shocking if you allow it to be shocking...,"My wife and I watched this a while ago, and to be honest with you it wasn't all that sickening, or scary, or gross as it's made out to be (i.e. trailers). Truthfully it was even scary or disturbing at all. I've seen scarier and grosser horror films than this...the actor who played the doctor was really good, creepy and the centipede actors were really into it, but seriously it was more laughable than anything...no spoilers or give away from me....but in the end, the movie was disappointing as I watched the trailer and the internet hype this movie has received was extraordinary...see for yourself. Worth a rental but not a purchase."
1,The Human Centipede,"This movie is disgusting. I almost puked. In fact I had to leave the room to prevent myself from puking. This whole concept is disturbing, and there is no real plot other than some sick man torturing people. The only reason why I watched it in the first place was because of a friend. Unless you have a very strong stomach, do not watch this movie let alone buy it."
1,"Trashy (NOT in a Good Way) Hollywood/""Alternative"" Mental Masturbation","This piece of crap stinks to high heaven and has the emotional and visual impact of a dried-up dog turd lying in the gutter. Don't bother further inflating the director's ego by watching. It's not even entertaining as voyeuristic video-trash. The investors should have their names broadly publicized for public shaming. I'm ashamed to admit I watched the first 20 minutes on Netflix one night at 3am when I couldn't sleep before turning it off and deciding to read the wall-paper instead. Has confirmed my belief that any idiot can make a ""movie"" if he pitches it to the lowest possible common denominator. REALLY. DON'T BOTHER. IT'S JUST STUPID, BORING AND UGLY."
3,good stuff,"I'm french and this blu ray can easily works on french player.The english subtitles are easy to understand.According to to the movie, it'a good movie although I expected it harder than what I had read about.According to the Blu ray, the picture is really splendid and superb! All the scene in white room or oustide are wonderful!"
3,Deminted,this movie has to be one of the most disturbing movies i've seen in a long time. the acting is great but the story is deminted. All i can say is that if you have a weak stomache i recomend that you do not watch this movie.
4,"Amazing and Creative Introduction To Twisted, Foreign Sci-Fi Horror","If you took this movie too seriously, then you gave it a low rating. This movie is not only sick, but well thought out. Yes, this movie is meant to make you cringe and test your stomach power. And I bet it fulfilled just that - ""oh, this is SO gross! I cant even watch!"". Right - horrible horror. That doctor is scarier than Freddy Kreuger, Michael Myers, and Chucky combined.AMAZING MOVIE AND WILL SCARE YOU IN THE GROSSEST WAY."
5,America's mouth grafted to Hollywood's anus,Those deriding this film as tasteless offal are missing the point. This film is obviously a metaphor for American film viewers being forced to swallow the putrid excrement flowing from the Hollywood film industry. The metaphor is a valid one and I offer kudos to the makers of this film for their insight.
1,gross,this movie is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. I WATCHED IT A FEW MONTHS AGO and still cannot get the images out of my mind.
1,Most disturbing movie I have dared to watch,"What kind of sick bastard thought up of this? This movie pushes the edge when it comes to sadistic. I highly recommend watching this if only to watch the South Park Episode ""The Human CENTiPad"" afterwards. The South Park episode makes more sense than the actual movie."
1,Worst Ever!,This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Sadistic and inhumane.Human torture is not entertainment in any form.
1,Just awful,Just a gore fest to see how quick they can make you puke.No artistic merit. Simply has no reason to be made.
1,grotesque,"The most detestable, disgusting movie I have ever seen. If Amazon's rating permitted me to, I would have given a -5 rating to this awful movie. Even after the movie I found myself almost throwing up from remembering such repulsive scenes."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen!,"Wow, I've seen some real stinkers in my time but this has to be by far the biggest steaming pile of excrement of them all! To those who haven't seen this yet, I recommend you don't waste 92 minutes of your lives on this like I did. I could go into further detail about why this movie is so terrible but I've got better things to do, just check out the other 1 star reviews on here."
1,Human Centipede,It was awful and espeacially the end. wheres the storyline??? dont waste your money. Some of it didnt make since
3,Why?,"I finally got to see this. But the waiting was hardly worth it. It does, however, have a unique theme.A brilliant German doctor that was famous for separating Siamese Twins, decided to create instead of separate and formed a human centipede using 2 American women tourists and a Japanese businessman. He went to a lot of great lengths to make it happen, but I ask myself, WHY?The ""human centipede"" was in the mad doctor's mind a new species. He kind of treated it like a dog---He was trying to teach it tricks. He felt that each ""segment"" had its own digestive system. SO he joined them, you guessed it--- a** to face. I couldn't stop laughing---no horror here! I felt sorry for the poor girl in the middle--even though she was a big pain.This movie has soo many flaws, but its great for laughs..."
3,Wow...just wow...,"I consider myself a huge horror movie fan, but there were moments during this movie where I had to look away from the screen. Its creepy, twisted, gross, perverted, but if you are a horror fan I think you will be satisfied. I did a review of it in more detail on youtube:[...]Check it out!"
1,We Need another film Genre,"Called ""Gross, Disgusting and Vile"", ya tink?? I cant get this flick out of my mind, yeeeesh! I'm not surprise so many viewers overwhelmingly gave it 1 anything!"
1,There are some things you just can't un-see.,Stay away from this movie at all costs. You'll wish for your time back. They've made a sequel if you can believe it. Watch the South Park parody instead.
1,gross,"I've warned my family and friends about this one. It is very gross. Fortunately, I was warned in time before ever seeing 2 girls 1 cup, which as I understand it is similar to this. I'll let you connect the dots."
1,It's SAW Meets A BUG'S LIFE!,"The ""filmmakers"" behind THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE decided there are two kinds of people in the world: those who love the cheery ingenuity of movies like Pixar's A BUG'S LIFE, and the other, the loyal minions who gleefully flock to each new gross-out installment of the SAW franchise. Why not combine the two disparate groups into one irresistible package? So it is that we have THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE, the opening salvo in what is sure to be a long and highly profitable series of ""How low can they go?"" cinema. Truly the stuff an accountant's dreams are made of."
1,This is horror?,"I'd been hearing about this movie for some time before seeing it. All I can say is ""wow"". I love all sub-genres of horror from cheesy to deeply disturbing. I heard this movie fell into the latter category. Outside of some wonderful acting by the lead the movie had nothing. If I am in the mood for serious horror I can find it in movies like Martyrs, Let The Right One In or Joshua. Shock for shock's sake can work but does not in this movie."
1,Disgusting,"this film is terrible and disgusting, I did not like it ,do not waste your time watching this film.if you want enjoy a really good movie watch the walking dead the first and second season and you going to love it."
1,Dont bother,"I love a good horror movie but this is just plain gross. There is nothing scary about it, definately not a psychological thriller. Its just disgusting. I can't see anyone giving this mess 5 stars. Glad it was free on Amazon Instant Video, I would've been mad if I'd paid to see it. Would like to see Amazon remove it from the lineup. Don't waste your time!"
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS ASS... literally.,"This 'one-big-grossout-joke' movie takes itself quite seriously and leaves a bad taste in your mouth (pun intended!) Altho gruesome, the silly premise leads basically nowhere - we're stuck in the exact same spot w/the exact same chowderheads we had in the first scene when the last one finally fades out. The director claims ""everything is 100% medically accurate"" - which is utterly absurd - and promises a sequel w/12 ""segments""... oh, boy I can hardly wait! I guess some might be tempted to say THIS MOVIE SUCKS ASS... and mean it, literally."
1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,This movie was so unbelievably stupid that the only rational explanation for the script's origin is that is was bashed out by Fanfiction.net's Tara Gilespie after sustaining a lobotamy.
2,The rubber ones are better.,"These sleeves work, but the foam is kind of icky. It picks up crud quickly. I've only had them a short time, I'm on my second pair and I'm about to switch them out for a third. They work fine for blocking outside sound, but I wish I had gotten the rubber sleeves. The ones my earphones came with lasted forever, until I lost them. Mind you, these are not bad enough that I have bothered to actually hunt down and purchase a set of rubber sleeves, but I'm a bit of a slacker, and writing reviews is more fun than pouring through tiny pictures of earbud caps."
5,Works great with Etymotic HF5 in-ear headphones,I've used these foam to be used withEtymotic Research HF5 Portable In-Ear Earphones (Ruby). The fit is perfect and it really makes a difference in the comfort. They seal well which in turn optimizes the sound quality of the earphones.Highly recommended
5,"Replace regularly, for relatively cheap","Tried it every way, and the best sound quality always comes from foam instead of rubber, and foam just loses its bounce after awhile. Replace every now and then and enjoy like new sound for years, saved me from buying new earphones."
5,I'm Into Wild Foods,I am into wild foods and this is the first one I have found that shows how to use kudzu. Most of the books about wild foods in the South feature plants that are hard to find and harvest. Kudzu is plentiful but I never knew what a gold mine it was until I read about a kudzu recipe contest that is open all during 2001 for cash prizes and bought this book.
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This was an amazing screenplay! I am a fan of Heath Ledger the actor who plays Toby in Blackrock so that was my first reason for buying the book but I am glad I did! You should definatly get this! I could not put it down! Its got everything! Sex, drugs, friendship, betrayal, surfing, murders, suicide, rape, cops...! Very serious issues and a very awesome book!"
4,Blackrock,"This movie deals with teenagers facing the loss of one of their friends to a violent crime. She was raped and the only person that saw the crime was Toby a 17 year old kid who likes to do what normal teens do. Surf, Drink and listen to loud music however his life is thrown upside down after seeing what turns out to be his best mate raping a girl from his school. This throws Toby into millions of unresolved issues because he doesn't know whether to turn in his best mate and feel guilty or live with the guilt of knowing that a friend of his has killed an innocent girl in such a way that it makes him want to throw up. In the end his friend throws himself off a cliff and kills himself so Toby doesn't have to do anything about it. Also in this book Toby's mum is diagnosed with breast cancer and has to have her breast removed she doesn't tell Toby this. In the end Toby settles things with his mum and also pays his last respects to the girl that he watched helplessly being raped."
1,A disappointment.,This is definately NOT the type of Fodor's guidebook I was expecting. Do not get this book if your expecting a Fodor's Gold Guide. I guess I'll donate the book to the local elementary school. There seems to be a paucity of guidebooks about Dallas. Maybe I should watch reruns of the show
3,Rating for Content,"I was assigned this book as a reading for an international development class. The book is has it's highlights, but it functions on the assumptions of dependency theory, generally considered to be an outdated developmental mindset. It raises some good points, but I my opinion it tries too hard to blame all of Africa's problems on colonialism. I have spent a few years in Africa and I can say that there are far more important problems for us to be focusing on. Blaming the colonists will give us someone to point the finger at, but it doesn't solve the immediate issues that Africa faces.To be fair, this book was published about twelve years ago, and the author died in a plane crash before he could finish editing the book.Overall, I was impressed with the amount of research and the depth of thinking, but I do not agree with the Ake's focus."
3,content good; paper quality poor,"The content is good, five stars for the writing. However, the paper quality is poor, one star for it. For those with vision problems the poor quality of the pages makes it difficult to read. The paper used for the book is cheap and has a tan color which lower the contrast making it difficult to read. Readers with poor eye visions will have difficulty reading through the whole book. Expect severe eye strains."
1,Author is a biggot!!!,"On page 377 of this book, the author puts in his own opinion of history and I quote, ""The Mormom rebellion against American was over. Plural mariages faded into history, even though a few diviant offshoots of the main Mormon branch secretly kept this practise alive. No doubt, thousands of good Americans siged with relief at the downfall of Satan, and the triumph of American morality.""I'm sorry, to have purchased this book. I assumed this would be a history of law book, but instead found it a disgusting waste of work, from a biggoted author. There was no need to put down any religion, and yet this author mid book, is calling an entire religion ""Satan"" worshippers. What does that opinion have to do with the history of law??? DO NOT BUY!!!"
5,Excellent,"I'll keep this brief: The title says it all. If you are looking for an excellent, in-depth introduction to the history of law in the U.S., then look no further. Tremendously readable, wonderfully informative, and above all, engaging; this book warrants not just one reading, but several. Read this book, study it, and you'll have taken an important first step towards not only a good layperson's understanding of the legal history of the U.S., but also an important step towards becoming an expert.Yes, it's that good. If a concise, yet richly detailed legal history is what you seek, this is it. Buy it and read it; you'll be glad you did."
5,"useful symbols, informative booklet, quality red rubber",If you've been burned by worthless (low quality) rubberstamp sets sold by book publishers you're wise to be cynical when you see another set on the shelf. I took the plunge and bought this set at a local independent bookstore and was pleased with the quality of the red rubber and the images themselves. I also enjoyed the well-designed and colorful booklet that reveals the history of the symbols and what each symbol actually means. The box the stamps are packaged in is wood and begs to be stamped and colored. What fun! My only complaint is with the wooden mounts. The mounts are thin cheap wood (with extra-thick dense foam cushion) so don't expect beautiful thick maple wood mounts! Considering the price though and the number of images (31) this didn't really detract from my overall enjoyment and satisfaction so I will give it 5 stars.
2,not so great if you're looking for accuracy,"As a person who spent over 2 years in Ghana and became pretty familiar with Adinkra symbols...I was disappointed with this stamp kit. I was excited when I saw this kit online but should have read the reviews before ordering as I see several other people felt let down too. I can hardly believe that the author left out the most well loved Adinkra symbol of all, ""Gye Nyame"", a symbol about the power of God. I really wish the author had put more effort into her research and included the names and accurate meanings of the symbols in the Twi language. Bummer."
1,stamp kit,"Disappointing, especially since she's actually spent time with adinkra printers. could have been more conprehensive and translations more accurate. Also disappointed not to see ethnic names of symbols displayed."
2,A disappointment....,"I had heard rave reviews about this stamp set and waited with great excitement. The stamps themselves are sufficient, though they are small. The disappointment was in the definitions, which are not accurate to the language and the fact that the two most popular Adinkra symbols were noticeably absent. While it is a good set to have around, I would have preferred to invest the money in a more accurate, larger mount set."
1,Most stamps inaccurate/lack true definition,"If you just want a bunch of random symbols that some random person made up explanations for, then please purchase this set. As already said by other reviewers many obvious and popular symbols are missing and the definitions/explanations are insufficient and/or completely wrong. Also some symbols are not accurately drawn either. Additionally, I don't understand how one can offer definitions in English but not provide information on the original Akan/Twi words/definitions (but I think that has to do with the fact that some symbols are clearly made up). Anyone who wants real definitions and symbols should check do a search for Adinkra symbols online (I am not affiliated with any site), you can get pics for free or you can save/download from the page. You can also find a limited number of Adinkra stencils on about.com."
5,Fast-Paced/Engaging Narrative of Loves Lost and Found,"This work is the first book that I have picked up, and been constantly unable to put down. It is an outstanding tale, well written if perhaps a bit ""wordy"" at times, and a bit unsentimental at the most poignant moments. All in all, a good work worthy of reading, and one that seems to ""stick"" in the mind well after the book is finished. One cares about the characters, gets to know them and like them. However, the most touching scenes and most emotional moments seem to gloss over a bit, and a bit more detail would add to the emotional impact for the reader."
1,How i was cheated...,"Do you want me to write out how i was cheated? I've received another book (""Mercy"") with the book cover of ""Only Love"" . Is it some kind of a ""New wine in the old bottle"" joke."
3,Predictable? Quite!,"A very easy read if you just want to pass the hours. A rather predictable story, with one man in love with two women - who shall he choose? In between, he is a cross between a musical wonder and a miraculous surgeon, all the while playing the humble pie routine. Rather an unlikely story, but as fiction goes, (yawn) it was alright..."
4,Definitely worth the time!,Not Erichs best book.....not on the level of Love Story....but books like love story don't come around everyday...that's what makes them special. Only Love is a great story and has deep pain in it. A quick read and a nice story I guarantee you won't forget it!
3,Only Love is only a book,"The promise of Segal as a novelist from Love Story is unfufilled in this book. The backdrop is fine with Paris, Ethiopia, and New England ... but Only Love falls short of making a compelling case for undying love. Better off with Anita Shreve and The Last Time They Met."
4,"""A classic love story""","The book was pretty good. I recomend this bool to those who love the classic story of love that should've been but could never be. I enjoyed Erich Segal's other novel entitled ""Love Story"". I think ""Only Love"" is for adult readers and ""Love Story"" is for younger readers such as college students. I gavew this book a 7 because the ending semed a bit rushed but it is also the point where is impossible to put the book down."
3,More pedestrian than his other works,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed ""Only Love,"" and in fact sped through it, but it didn't even come close to his masterpieces like ""Love Story"" and ""The Class."" I found the plot predictable and correctly guessed how it would end about a third of the way through it."
4,Solid pop album from the late '80s.,"Ivan Neville's debut album features many elements common to albums made in the '80s--drum machines, big reverb/delay vocals, and several keyboard tracks--but they never overshadow the songwriting which is a hybrid of pop styles, very succinct, and with memorable melodies and big hooks. The quality of the songwriting is consistent and there are no mediocre songs on the album. A great, under appreciated '80s pop album worth owning."
2,Disappointed,"My wife and I were excited about this machine after we read the reviews. But the icecream texture is too rough for our taste, we have tried sorbet and icream recepies and it is never smooth...you can feel the little ice crystals. It is very fast though, under 30 minutes you'll have your icecream, but if you just mix your fruit with frozen milk or cream and have a very good blender, you'll get very similar results...I would not have bought it if I had tried it first. Maybe the blade is too slow, or it freezes too fast, whatever it is, is not great texture icecream, that's for sure. Not gelato, that's is for sure!!!After a few more weeks of use, we have tried some good recepies and you get somewhat better results, so I guess the recepie has a lot to do with it, but do not expect that you blend milk, sugar, fruit and put it in this thing and presto...if you want good icecream you'll have to cook it right before you put it on...maybe it was just my ignorance on how icecream is made..."
1,Misleading Marketing,"This item is marketed as a Gelato maker. However it is an ice cream maker, not a Gelato maker. Big Difference! Gelato is made from milk and contains only milk fat. This product requires heavy cream."
3,Lello Gelato 4070,"It does every its suppose to do, but its easier to buy gelato from an Icecream shop. Unless you making the real thing, it easier to be lazy and buy the Icecream."
4,Great ice cream BUT (plus update),The machine is great but I ruined the recipe/instruction book and now find that the Lello people want SEVENTEEN DOLLARS for a replacement! It's only 40 pages and small...$17! What a ripoff.Update: I sent a snarling email to the Lello people and they sent me the recipe book for free.
3,poor customer service,I purchased the machine less than two years ago. It is used primarily in the summer so it has not had a great deal of usage. This summer it just plain doesnt work and any attempts at customer service have not been successful. I loved the machine but am in doubt if we will purchase another to replace this one.
3,My first gelato,I'm pleased with this machine for the most part. The time frames listed for creating masterpieces was incorrect. In most cases it took twice as long. I've learned a lot about the process and I'm ready to move on to a larger version.
4,"A great, easy way to experiment with ice cream/gelato.","I have been playing around with cheap ice cream makers for years - I always give up after a few batches because it's too much trouble. This machine is so easy that in my first week I made a batch a day (to my kids' delight). The book is helpful, but I wanted really thick creamy gelato like they serve in Rome, so I surfed the web and created my own formula using what seemed important (liquore to keep it from freezing, egg yolk for the custard flavor, corn starch helps it be really smooth, etc). It's a lot of fun and very easy. My only complaint is that the hole for adding ingredients is pretty small -- it's difficult to pour in a stream of thick fudge, for example. But really, it's a great little machine and really fun to play with."
2,Big Disappointment,"Well, folks, here's the news flash: We've had the Lello Junior 4070 for exactly 26 months and it's broken. It simply stopped freezing the gelato. So I tried to locate the parent organization, Lello Appliance, and zipped them an email at LelloAppliances@aol.com as a live person does not answer their phone. They responded the next day advising me to call Electra Craft Inc, a service center, at 201-439-1700. When I called Electra, they informed me that the repair would most likely run around $100 plus shipping both ways. Well, I'd wind up paying close to the cost of the entire machine at that rate. Bummer. So I've sent another email to Lello seeing if they can help in some way. If not, I'm definitely going to be changing brands. Big, big disappointment."
2,I used it 15 times and stopped working,"When I first got this machine it worked very nicely, you get very creamy ice cream in about 20-25 minutes. Just after the 1 year warranty expired the machine stopped freezing, meaning that the motor is working but the mixture is not getting cold, so something with the cooling system went bad. If you get this machine I will recommend you to use it as much as possible during the first year so if it breaks you are still cover for the warranty."
4,Great little machine,"The machine was a little bigger than I expected, but it fits on the counter nicely and does an excellent job of making a smooth and creamy end product. It's relatively quiet and efficient. Watch it closely to avoid over mixing (makes for a grainy texture) the first time you try a new recipe.I didn't care for the recipes in the booklet. As a former professional, I reccomend finding a good recipe book by a reputable pastry chef, which will give you better tips for at-home success.My only complaint is that although the lid removes completely, you can't submerge it in water because there is a small fan attached to it. You can only wipe it down with a damp cloth."
1,DO NOT BUY THE LELLO GLATO MACHINE,"When it's working it's fine, but it rarely is working.I have owned this machine for approx. two years. In that time I may have used ta half dozen time and had the ""the churn motor"" once last year. This year when I decided to use itit would not churn even though I may have used it only twice since replacing it.Now I am stuck with a huge expensive appliance which is useless for churning ice cream.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY ITALIAN DESIGNED MACHINE ."
4,Good Results,"I received my ice cream maker last week and couldn't wait to use it.I started out with the Maple Walnut recipe in the supplied book as I had all the ingredients on hand so there was no preparation. The ice cream came out wonderfully! I did find that I had to run the machine for 5 min longer to get the proper consistency.I knocked off one star since the plastic lid is permanently attached to the motor housing of the paddle, so you can't immerse it to clean and cleaning thoroughly is a bit difficult. Other than that, so far I have no other problems with this machine.For the reviewer who was disappointed about not being able to make gelato, I can't really see why you couldn't as ""gelato"" is really only ice milk in reality...experiment and you might be surprised! In fact, here is a link to a site that gives ice cream and gelato recipes. As a matter of fact the ice cream maker they picture *is* a Lello!http://www.ice-cream-recipes.com/"
4,Tomasalvin,"I am happy to have the Gelato 4070.The machine works perfectly making high quality icy treats. I would have given 5 stars but...Excellent customer service by Amazon. I, unfortunately got a defective unit.A simple click on the link led to a simple form; which led to an immediate email; which begot a new and proper functioning Gelato 4070 in three days. The 5th star will be given next year after the first summer of trouble free use.The Gelatolization of my summers cooling eats and treats life has begun."
1,Nothing but Problems,"I've had this machine for about a year and at first it made really great ice cream...but things have recently started to change. First, the control panel became disconnected from the top of the machine. Shortly afterward, the mechanism (black rubber knob) that provides power to the churn mechanism fell down into the casing. Since I am overseas and it is very expensive to ship this heavy machine for repairs, I decided to see if I could repair it myself. After wrestling with non-standard screws that hold the case in place, I discovered that both the control panel and the black rubber knob were held in place by very flimsy plastic brackets and metal screws. These brackets had broken apart in several places, leaving the machine unusable. Buyer beware - as usual, you get what you pay for."
5,best little ice ream maker,"great product, makes a quart of delicious ice cream, sorbet or gelatto effortlesly. Just make the mix, cool mix and and then place in ice cream maker while you do something else, i.e. make dinner. Self contained machine works like a charm. It is heavy and it is noisy but its about 300 to 400 dollars less than a stainless import and it does the same job. If you need an ice cream maker, look no further. By the way the recipes that are included are ok, but way too sweet. Buy The Ultimate Ice Cream Book by Bruce Weinstein, cut the sugar by half and you'll never know the difference."
1,This machine is a piece of junk,"Right at the first batch, after turning the machine on, I got the error of ""stuck rotor"". I had to reset the unit every five minutes so the rotor could blend the ice cream base. It took about 2 hours to notice a slightly frozen cream. Each and every component of this Lello machine is cheap and most likely this is the worst product I ever purchased (till today). If you are serious about getting an ice cream machine, stay away from Lello. I'm convinced that even for Chinese products stadard, this is is a total failure."
3,Took WAY Longer Than 30 minutes,"I just made my first item in this maker-- a Marion Blackberry Sorbet. I had to let it run for more than an hour and fifteen minutes, and it still wasn't totally firm at that point. However, I figured it was good enough and took it out to freeze it. I'm not sure why it's taking so long to work-- after the first recommended 25 minutes, I checked and the mixture was barely colder than when I put it in. Is it normal for it to take this long for the freezer to work?"
4,Great LITTLE ice cream maker!!,"Wow, I have to say that machine makes some great ice cream! And, it does it in about 35-40 min for a full batch with the mix at refridge temp.PROS*Quiet*Self cooling*Can make batch after batch without stopping*Modest price*Seems well made for the most partCONS*Very small 1q container makes small batches of ice cream*Included recipe book is VERY VERY poor; the recipe for custard base was nearly inedible, frozen margarita was the worst I have ever had. Many conversions from metric are incorrect. Throw it out and Google for some good ones.Also, you can use this for frozen drinks, lemon ice like desserts, and to chill a bottle of wine if you want.Here is my recipe for standard ice cream base:3c 1% or no-fat milk1c heavy cream1 can sweetened condensed milk4 egg yolks1t-3t vanilla to tasteMix it all together with a whisk and you are ready to make ice cream. No need to cook it!"
1,Pass On This Piece of Junk,"I read all of the reviews good and bad and on balance thought this thing was worth a try. When it arrived, it was clear that it was a reconditioned unit, something several people had observed also happened to them. It even had gelato mix on the cord! Nonetheless, I needed it for a traditional Thanksgiving ice and decided to try it anyway. What a complete piece of crap.This thing bears no relationship to a gelato machine. It's really just like a salt freezer with an electric compressor.. The motor is a joke. In order to make it run at all, I literally had to prop up the cover of the machine with quarters. It's pathetically weak and operates like a battery powered children's toy.In this case, you get what you pay for. Don't waste your time with this trasher. Buy a real one or pass."
4,Fantastic ice cream maker,"I bought this for my husband's 30th birthday gift. We love it. He uses it at least once a week to make ices, ice cream, gelatto, and everything in between. It freezes fast and without any large crystals; the results are always smooth and delicious. My biggest complaint has to be the top; if you're not SUPER careful, your mix can get up into the underside of the lid. We've had to unscrew a few parts to clean it, which is doable, but a pain. Otherwise, a great, great product."
2,not so happy with gelatos,well it is a great machine and it is easy but it is too smallit only makes about 2 cups and it takes a long time........I returned it and I will buy the bigger one. Thanks
4,"for the money, can't be beat!","worked great for me right out of the box. I only have one batch under my belt (literally) LOL; honey strawberry-banana non-fat frozen yoghurt. it tasted as good as it sounds. everythink worked as expected, freezer component worked perfectly, no muss no fuss. threw everything in a blender then pored it into the bowl. close the lid (the handle on the lid must face away from the motor or the motor won't seat properly, this is not explained in the manual).32 minutes later, I had perfect frozen yoghurt. To get it really hard and frozen like in the store it needs the refridgerator freezer for 20 minutes after coming out of the machine. but the freezer element in the machine worked great, actually the yoghurt was hard frozen on the edges of the container. Now we'll see how long it lasts..."
2,Worked well at first....,I've had a 4070 Gelato Junior for about three years. At first it froze a batch of ice cream in about 35 minutes. Gradually the freezing times got longer until it took over an hour to freeze. Now it barely gets cold and won't freeze at all.I contacted Lello service and found that the problem is most likely a refrigerant leak and that repairs would cost at least $75 (not including shipping).I'm now in the market for another ice cream machine. The next one won't be a Lello.
2,Works great - IF it works at all!,"This is a great concept, and I bought one of these for a friend that worked OK. But, the first one that I ordered arrived broken (wouldn't get cold at all. Amazon promptly sent another. It ran for a week and then died. It was nice while it lasted, but not worth reordering! Quality assurance is clearly very poor, and I suspect that the device is too sensitive to be sent through the mail with a high rate of success."
4,GREAT SORBET,"Excellent small machine. Makes just the right amount for a single guy (and enough to share too). Good recipies too. I find that the time recomended to complete a batch is too short......(25-30 Min.) I have used it twice with all very cold ingredents, and it has taken 60 to 67 min. to complete. So easy to use. No mess of salt or ice all over, and Very easy to clean....Would recomend it to all homemade ice cream lovers."
4,Devil's Advocate,How can anything with Pacino be bad? Captured my attention and kept me interested. Could watch it over and over again.
4,Connie Nielsen AND Charlize Theron...,"...so you cannot go wrong and neither does TaylorHackford in this very entertaining movie.Pacino chews the carpet in his best Pacino-esque style.Reeves is his usual block of wood.Charlize Theron gets to show some serious acting skills.Connie Nielsen is drop dead gorgeous.Why isn't Ms Nielsen in more movies? I can only rememberher as the Commodus' sister in ""Gladiator"" where she wasagain outstanding.I think I could only believe Ms Nielsen in this part - thatrequires the viewer to accept that someone married to CharlizeTheron could be swayed by the tempting charms of another woman."
4,"Pacino, Reeves an unlikely pair","A wild, over-the-top production, with Pacino having more fun than he's had since ""Scarface."" At times illogical, overlong, and overindulgent, the film is a blast to watch. Reeves turns in his typical wooden performance, but it somehow perfectly compliments his character. The rest of the cast is forgettable, but Pacino is so good that you look past most of the film's many flaws. The film contains some graphic and unsettling sexual content, so it's definitely not for the kids. It's a lot of fun, though, even if it is improbable and far-fetched."
5,This film is one of the few that actually scared me.,"With wonderful direction and great writing I thought it was probably one of my favorite films. And I can only think of one other person besides Al Pacino that could take on the role of Satan, and that's Christopher Walken. Now don't get me wrong, Pacino did a beatiful job. The thing that I thought made it one of my favorites is that I couldn't predict the ending, neither could anyone else who saw it with me. So if you liked the movie The Game, then you'll love Devil's Advocate."
1,Surely the Devil's work,"I know I am up against many people here who have rated this move quite highly, with that I am willing to accept that I must of missed the point to this movie giving the fact that towards the end I hated it so much. I couldn't watch another second of it and turned it off with roughly 5 minutes to go, Pacino's last scene where he tells Keaunu the truth would have to be one of the worst written scenes I've ever seen. I found the first hour extremely boring, then it started to get a little bit interesting and then in the last half an hour it lost me again. Don't get me completely wrong the acting in this movie was A class from all actors, it's just a dam shame about the script. If I could give this movie 0 stars I would but seeing that I have to give it 1 the 1 star goes for the acting."
1,Devil's Badvocate,This movie could have been better if Al Pacino morphed into Jackie Chan and Keanu Reeves into Chuck Norris. They would decide the fate of the Earth over a mind boggling cgi kung fu blowout. Talk about good versus evil.
1,Devils Pain,Whack. I watch this movie hoping it to be good. But when you start cussing God in a movie you are way off base. And need a whole lot of prayer.
3,Coulda been a classic,"Al Pacino as the Devil, and the Devil as a New York lawyer. You can't start out there and go totally wrong. You can still do a lot of things wrong though. Here's a few.* The secondary storyline of Charlize Theron's mental breakdown. It didn't go anywhere, didn't add anything and could have been substituted for more courtroom hijinks in a heartbeat.* Keanu Reeves as the junior attorney. Totally miscast. I love Keanu in roles where he's suited for the part -- ""The Matrix"" comes to mind -- but when he's miscast he's *terribly* miscast.* The vacuity of some of Pacino's lines. Listen closely to the Eddie Barzoon monologue and you'll hear nothing but extremely well-delivered banalities. Ditto for large swaths of Pacino's closing monologue, although his ending speech has a few lines that are so good they make up for the rest. ""I am a humanist"" and ""God is an absentee landlord"" both spring to mind."
3,Accpetable,The plot itself wasn't that bad but it didn't came out as it should be. Reeves and Pacino made a great pair. The major flaw in this movie is that the story goes all over the place. You don't know wat your looking at untill the last minute of the film. So that leaves us questioning through out the whole entire movie. The other thing is that the movie has too much nude and sexual scenes that were not needed. They just put it there to spice things up a little.Thiss not the type of movie that is worth you searching in the video store for. But if your looking for an intresting story plot and you are willing to look past the flaws it is the right one for you. The acting wasn't bad really.
5,The Devil's Advocate,This has to be the best performance by Reeves prior to The Matrix. Why he did not receive an Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie is beyond comprehension! As always AlPacino is superb. Excellent script and acting. It sent chills down my spine. Worth renting or owning.
2,very average,"well we have here one Actor who though i respect and is an All-Time Great, is becoming over time a one trick OVer The Top Acting Fool.that is Al Pacino.every film over the past decade has been this way.this is no exception.and as far as the other Actor goes Keanu Reeves is as Lame Brain as they come.he is a 3rd tier Tom Cruise.the film has some moments but overall is pretty empty.nothing that i haven't seen already."
5,Keanu Reeves - Al Pacino: a perfect choise,"It is the best movie. Keanu Reeves was absolutly briliant. The story is not original at all. Remember <Faust> and other similary storys. But the vision of this one was fenomenal. Al Pacino was the same for me. What can I tell more about him? He is already Big Star. However, the duo Reeves - Pacino was a perfect choise. And I saw a diferent Keanu, more substantial, full of feelings. You can love him, only seeing this picture. Sorry for my stinky english."
2,Sheer intensity mixed with senseless nutidy and nastiness,"This film had some great performances while at the same time had situations that were disgusting and uncalled for. Al Pacino, as he usually does, gave a great performance, while at the same time, left me grosed out and disgusted. This film had senseless digusting nutidy and gore. Al Pacino's performance was great, but because he made such a brilliant series like the Godfather, he could've picked a better movie that didn't have the disgusting violence, nudity, and gore."
4,riveting,"This was an unusual story, very interesting. May be too sexual, or scary for some people. Really enjoyed the performances of the actors."
5,Must watch,"This movie was everything I heard it would be. There were so many unexpected events in this movie, and it was quite informative!"
5,Good Horror\thriller,"I just saw this movie and it is very good. It features a very terrifying performance by Al Pacino, who plays the devil. The movie follows a young Florida lawer who has never lost a case(Keanu Reeves), but there is one case he wishes he never won. After winning a case against a teacher accused of assulting a student he is contacted by a powerful new york law firm, of course he accepts, but what he does not realize is that the head of the law firm is Satan(AL Pacino). He goes with his wife (Charlize theron) who soon starts seeing strange things. Things get worse and worse till a thrilling climax. It has good performances by the whole cast."
2,Greed has a positive aspect?,"I read one review on this film that said ""... about the negative aspects of greed ..."". My God! HAha! Man, you did not understand anything in this life, and obviously cannot understand this movie, as well. Nevermind... ."
2,Pacino histrionics,"Suffice it to say that the longer I watched this film, the sorrier I became that I was wasting 2 hours of my life watching it."
1,Poor DVD picture quality,"The DVD has at least 4 split second glitches during the first 45 minutes of the movie. Buy the DVD if you want, but be prepared for these picture jitters. Poor Quality Control on this release. I'm putting this DVD on the same shelf as my Laserdisc print of Basic Instinct (with one bad sound glitch - a loud static 'pop' about halfway through the movie)."
2,ZZZZZZZzzz,"The acting was ok, and it had its good moments, but I must be the only person here who thought it was dragged out and boring."
2,The Devil Made Him Do It,"Devil's Advocate is the kind of devil-may-care mess I would have thought was real spiffy when I was fifteen. It stars the dark angel himself, has well-placed blood and guts, and prances more naked women across the screen than a Russ Meyer film. But despite some strong special effects, this stinker goes down in flames in more ways than one. After the showing, I heard a guy cozied up to the urinal say it was ""different."" Sure. If cheesy, dopey, and way obvious is his idea of different. This here's no Omen, but methinks it does represent a bad moon rising for Big Al. He deserves to burn in movie hell for this one."
1,"Laughable, but not in a good way.","One of the worst movies to slither out of Hollywood this decade. Silly, predictable trash. Keanu Reeves is unable to make me believe he can spell 'lawyer', much less be one. Poor silly stupid Keanu, he looks like he knows how inept he is but has no idea of what to do about it. Al Pacino goes wildly over the top, because, well, he has to do something to keep audiences awake. There really are better movies out there. Buy another one. Avoid this one."
1,really really bad,"There is absolutely nothing about this movie to recommend itself. The plot is so utterly pedestrian, the acting is poor to fair, and there is not an iota of subtlty or any interesting twist to it. Yes, Pacino makes a pretty good devil, but that is about it. Keanu Reeves is totally unbelivable as a superduper hot-shot lawyer - he is so bad that it is simply embarassing and almost painful to watch him; he is best suited to comic book roles, like that in Matrix, and this film required someone better to make it come alive. As such, this is a total dud. TOTAL."
1,The Essential No-brainer for all the Half-wits out there,"I've never reviewed on amazon before, but when I saw that this movie had 5 stars, I knew it was time. If you're just a complete moron and love movies that anybody with any intelligence would find trite, you're in luck. This is easily one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen. And the acting is truly a masterpiece. Keanu Reeves. . .I didn't think that it was possible to top Speed. And, boy, has Al Pacino hit upon hard luck. What happened to the great actor we knew and loved in the Godfather and Dog Day Afternoon? Who else have we got? Well, we've got the guy who played the principal in Ferris Bueller as the Devil's right-hand man. And we've got the girl from Mighty Joe Young as Keanu's wife. Just an all-star cast. But if you do see it, see it for the plot."
2,Keanu disappoints,"The weak link in this movie is Keanu Reeves, disappointingly. I loved him in My Own Private Idaho. Speed was fun. But here, he looks like he's acting. Keanu is stiff and unnatural, and never becomes the role he plays. For the entire movie, I am never able to suspend disbelief and be absorbed in the story when Keanu is onscreen, he is that distracting. And what about that phoney accent? See this movie for Al Pacino and a few special effects - when it comes on television, as it does often."
1,Hated It,Had to watch this for a legal ethis course. Love all of the actors but the plot was simply too stupid. It's difficult to get through to the end.
3,"Not Great, Not Horrible","A decent movie with good, strong preformances, especially Charlize Theron. The curch scenes that take place in Gainesville were shot across the street from my house, and I remember watching the crew film them with my mother and sister from my backyard, which was pretty neat!"
4,Damn lawyers.,The spawn of Satan is a lawyer.Who the hell is surprise by that?Fun ride & Al is great.
4,Not too horrible ...,"Watch Mia Farrow redecorate her huge new New York apartment while she begins to get a creepy feeling from her neighbors. Watch her cut her hair, have baby-drama, dreams (maybe), crack up and run down the long narrow hallway in the apartment with a butcher knife. Oh wait, it's Charlize Theron ... oops.Still kind of fun. Sort of a mirror-image Rosemary's Baby. This time told from the husband's POV.Stylish effects, and some wild action. Nudity galore, Actuallythis is pretty entertaining."
5,This movie is great. It enters the soul and never leaves.,"This movie deserves way more credit than it's getting. It's reality and it really makes you as the viewer think. Every time I watch it something new is brought to my attention. And yes, ""Vanity, definitely my favorite sin."""
5,Comes closer to real life than one actually thinks,Free will and the existence of Satan go hand in hand in this work of fiction that seems closer to real life than any of us would care to admit!
4,Another Pacino classic,My favorite devil movie of all time with a portrayal only Pacino could pull off.
5,Profound movie...deeply spiritual.,"The best spiritual movies I ever saw with ""The Matrix"". ""The Devil's Advocate"" present an underlying spirituality content that is very deep and rich in a very entertaining way. The movie keeps you absorbed by it continuous twists and questions ( like ""The Game""). It portrays all the tricks of deception the mind uses to keep us entangled in this world. Of course the movie wouldn't have been the same without Al Pacino which personally blew me away...the power of the speeches and comments he gave during the all movie wear just phenomenal. The more you watch this movie, the more you start to understand how our powerful mind (i.e. devil) works. It's definitely a keeper."
2,"Great story and acting, but very blasphemous","This is a great movie with great acting. It is impossible for Pacino to act bad. The reason I took 3 stars off is because there is a scene for approx. 10 minutes in which Al yells and states things that are very blasphemous towards Jesus Christ, it is 5 times as bad as the Exorcist (as far as blasphamy). I would not reccomend this for anyone very religious."
3,I can't take it anymore.,"Three stars. Five stars for Al Pacino, and take away two for Keanu Reeves. Who the hell told this guy he could act? Making silly kid movies is all he can do and it was still hard enough watching him. The absurd Southern accent he tries to pull off goes from silly to ridiculous to nauseating. Who the hell talks like that? I avoid Keanu like the plague, but he's always in some movie that I end up seeing anyway."
4,Rent First,"Again, Al Pacino over the top and Keanu Reeves giving a wooden performance.But, any film with Charlize Theron nude can't be all bad.Give it a rental."
5,best movie ever,I keep watching them so much that I have to keep buying new ones. Love this movie. Should be made a all time classic.
3,"if Pacino were your father, you'd shoot yourself too","filled with some gross imagery and some fine performances, although Keanu has some wooden stuff he manages to capture the emotion and the spark at the end where he confronts Pacino, his father, then shoots himself sending Pacino back to hell. but all in all there is some tremendous nudity scenes in here, including at the end with Connie Nielsen and in the church with Charlize Theron, plus when Keanu makes whoopi with Theron then sees Nielsen and just trips out. Jeffrey Jones is out of place and some of the supportees lack this one but its an ok view, mostly for Pacino's energetic devil part."
2,Bad acting and repulsive teeth sucking.,"Keaunu Reeves is a horrible actor. Al Pacino putting his pointy tongue along his veneers is so gross and makes me throw up a bit every time it happens in the film, which is like every five minutes. The irrational leap they ask us to make in thinking any one of the beautiful extras would think he is sexy, even if he had supernatural powers, is an insult to intelligence. You gotta love the devil's daughter's botched boob job in the end when she says ""look at me"" as though she were gorgeous and she is as skinny as a concentration camp victim. Sorry, the story was ok but whoever made this movie needed to pay attention to these details and there are many."
5,Absolutely the best of the genre ...,"With all the Law and Order type of programs that we are inundated with I was especially surprised to find myself really enjoying this 'fantasy' movie ....It is a whopping 225 minutes long and although there are sections that do drag a bit it certainly does not take away from the film as a whole. Is there realy a Pacino movie that we don't just love? I doub't it ....The story and the plot line is crisp and it is one of those films that twists and turns ... and, most importantly .. the viewers has no idea of how it will end until you actually see the end ...WOW ,, not many films that we say that !!!!!!!"
3,One of my fav...,I always found this movie to be one of the best by Al and Keanu...It epitomises the never ending battle between good and evil and the Devil's never ending quest to fulfil the desires of this flesh ;)
1,One bad actor spoils the whole bunch . . .,This movie really had the potential to be great had it been cast with someone other than Keanu Reeves. Reeves is such a bad actor that I was embarrassed for him and then in myself for watching. I don't know who the genius was that cast Reeves but I'm assuming it was because Glen Campbell wasn't available.
5,Thought-provoking film!,"I was just browsing through TV channels one evening and came across this film as it was just beginning. Since it starred Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino (two very good and entertaining actors in my view), I decided to watch it. The storyline really held my interest and I have to say that I was completely surprised with the ending -- I never saw it coming! The last 20 minutes of this film had me totally captivated!! I thought it was an excellent film and have recommended it to others who have enjoyed it as well. It's the kind of film that has you thinking about the message (if you choose to believe there's a message, which I did) long after you've seen it."
4,Decent Movie and Good Acting by Pacino and Reeves!,"This movie is pretty good, not anything great but good! It has great acting by Pacino(what else is new), and Reeves, which is a surprise because many people have said that he couldn't act, but proves them wrong in this movie. Its a movie about the Devil which is one of my favorite topics, but it was pretty entertaining. I recommend this movie for any fan of Al Pacino."
5,What a fun movie!,"Oh, let's get simple here. This is a really fun, entertaining movie with just the right mix of wit, and polish, bravado, spectacle, and surprise. Pacino, being one of the 5 real actors in Hollywood, delivers a spectacular performance. Reeves, with a part perfectly tailored to who he is, also provides a great performance.I'm glad we own it because we'll be enjoying it over and over again. A real grinner."
4,The chuckle/grin on Pachinos face...,...as the young lady goes exploring under the restaraunt table is worth the price of the disc alone...
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,Keanu Reeves as a brilliant attorney. That's a bit of a stretch isn't it. I have to give him credit he has gotten further on minimal talent than most. And Pacino's lucifer was too brash for my taste. A subtler prince of darkness would have to me been more intriguing.The ending monologue is entirely too long and uneccesarily melodramatic. The earlier scenes in the film where Pacino was less brash although more charismatic were more interesting. And although the special effects were fabulous perhaps having less of them say with only hints of the true nature of certain characters the film may have been more interesting. Give us (the audience) some credit.It's a rental not a purchase.
1,Deleted scenes WITHOUT director's commentary please!!!,"I have been a fan of this film since I first saw it back in 97'. I was thrilled by the deleted scenes with director's commentary on the DVD. However, I was severely annoyed with and dissapointed by the fact that there is no option to view the deleted scenes without the director's commentary. Viewing the scenes and listening to the director's vision was both exciting and interesting. But in this fan's humble opinion, they left out one very important ingredient. Specifically, the option to experience the director's vision in its natural state without his commentary. If anyone out there knows a way to turn off the commentary and increase the volume of the actual deleted scenes I'd love to know it. Furthermore....if there ARE versions out there of the deleted scenes without commentary I'd love to own one!"

4,fun,My son enjoys playing with this. It's quality is great. I would recommend this to others. It comes with 8 marbles which makes it fun to race them down the tubes. good toy.
2,needs improvement,not well made and some of the marbles do not go all the way through the unit also it is kind of flimsy falls apart with just a little touch
2,Great idea - but not stable enough to work well,"My boys are 4 and 6 years old and were SO excited about this toy. It is a wonderful concept, but is very difficult for small kids to put together so an adult or older child needs to help. Even so, it is difficult to build something stable. If there was a way to make the base more stable it would be a better toy. It often fell apart quite easily no matter how we constructed it, and this led to a lot of frustration. Also, the design of many of the pieces does not make sense in terms of the marbles flowing through the channels. There are a lot of marble products on the market, and it would be worthwhile researching to see if there is a more stable set before purchasing this one. I bought this on sight without doing so, but wish I had now."
4,My 6 yr old loves this toy!,He can spend a long time building different structures for a long time and is so proud of himself. I think this is a smart toy.
5,Great!!!,"It is wonderful to find a CATHOLIC bible study. There areso many christian products so to find a Catholic product with great lessons and crafts it is so enjoyable. We are using this in our home, with our boys club and in CCD. I definite must have for the Catholic family to enjoy together."
4,Not exactly what I expected... but still good,"This book, as per my title, was not exactly what I expected. It had extensive information on basic Thaumaturgy, quite a few new Rituals, and a few old ones, and all of the new Paths were quite interesting, one of them even resembling some of the Dark Age system Koldunic Sorcery Rituals from Libellus Sanguinis I... However, the parts where it failed to impress me were these: The information on Necromancy was seriously lacking, in the traditional Necromancy part anyway, there were no new paths and only 5 rituals, and it only had 2 rituals for Koldunic Sorcery... which was a bit pathetic. The Vodoun Necromancy part was satisfactory, as was the Assamite Sorcery section. Over all, you should buy this book. >:>)"
1,Dazed and Confused,"This book is a confusing set of devices and instructions for players and storytellers alike. It is hard to read and equally hard to understand--i found my High School government textbook easier to read than this. However, if you do want to give you Tremere scorcer/witch a bit more depth i would recomend this book, and its companion book."
5,Inspired cultural commentary,"Denise Bombardier provides a surprising and often humourous response to the cultural differences between the French and North Americans. She shows great understanding of the strengths, weaknesses and inconsistencies of the three nations which she touches upon in her book: the U.S., Canada and France. She deals with very sensitive issues with a direct and captivating style."
3,Did I miss something!,"I purchased two of these books for graduation gifts... for my grandson and one of his friends. The books are still in the box. I had second thoughts about giving them as gifts, since an entire chapter is devoted to alcohol, drinking games and recipes for mixed drinks. I'm not a prude, but the boys graduated from a christian academy and it didn't seem an appropriate gift. Lesson learned: Study the table of contents when the book is purchased as a gift. Somehow I missed seeing that particular chapter."
5,Typically Brilliant George Russell,"The great composer/pianist George Russell builds on his illustrious past with this 1962 recording. A player who has recorded with luminaries like Eric Dolphy, Bill Evans and Art Farmer is joined on this one by a young Don Ellis on trumpet, Pete LaRoca on drums, trombonist Garnett Brown, tenor player Paul Plummer and 21 year-old bassist Steve Swallow. In addition, the band is joined on one track with what I believe is Sheila Jordan's debut recording, a truly bizarre take on ""You Are My Sunshine"". Russell does two originals, a cooking ""The Outer View"" and the pleasantly odd ""D.C. Divertimento."" Bird's ""Au Privave"" is given a facelift. George Russell has the distinction of sounding both familiar and alien. Yet another brilliant outing from the always underrated Russell."
4,Sheila Jordan Wails,"For me this album is about Sheila Jordan. Her largely a cappella ""You Are My Sunshine"" is the highlight of George Russell's excellent avant garde album. Her contribution is stunningly good. Don Ellis on trumpet is also a real treat. Good stuff."
5,Here be No Monsters,"I was immediately drawn into Here be Monsters when I saw it on a shelf in a local bookstore. It is captivating, seeming to meld the curious Victorian imagery of Edmund Gorey with the density and endlessness of a 100 year old Sears Roebuck catalog.But I have to be frank. My son has a very active imagination (read ""nightmares"") and I was not that interested in providing more grist for that mill!So let me clear the air here. The only monsters are humans, and while they are dastardly and mean, they are not terrifying. Just the same mean, self-centered, narcissistic jerks that life is full of.The so-called monsters in this book (boxtrolls, cabbageheads and the like) are charming, caring, thoughtful, and endearing. But not scary.Please buy this book. Buy five copies. Buy ten. If only that you will bless five or ten children (so far I have tested on a five and a ten year old) with a sweet, fun, clever, creative romp through Ratbridge."
1,Camco rv anti-freeze pump,Very disappointed with this product. The pump worked fine but not all parts were included in the kit as pictured in the ad. The faucet fitting was not included.
1,Camco RV Anti-Freeze pump,"Very poor quality. Pump did not work, put together badly and leaked. Ended up in garbage can."
4,It worked just like it said it would.,"It takes a lot of pumping to get it primed, but it still only took about 3-5 minutes to get the job done. I had read other reviews about the tubing coming off, so I figured it was better to get it on as tight as possible before starting, and trying to put it back together after it was wet would have been a pain."
5,Memories of southern days gone by,"Good Old Country Gospel is a wonderful collection of music and artists that evoke times spent around the radio listening to broadcasts from big cities like Birmingham,Nashville or Memphis.The quality of the recording I recieved is quite good even over the speakers of my laptop.Highly recommend this CD to anyone with a love of old-time gospel!"
4,Good Gospel,"This is a Good Gospel CD. It would be a Great Gospel CD if it weren't for them throwing in some Bluegrass which twangs on my ears. Now, if you're a Bluegrass fan, you might well consider this a Great Gospel CD. I love to sing along while driving and this CD is good for that, having gospels everyone knows. I recommend this CD."
2,Important topic.. but this book missed the mark...,"I believe this is an important topic. Rev. Booth does a nice job explaining the disease process but comes to strange conclusions. His previous anti-protestant views have become anti-Christian views. His arrogance in rewriting church history and ""mind reading"" Christs intentions will, rightfully, turn off many of the folks who may have been helped by a book on this subject. This is an unfortunate use and loss of a good platform and important topic! The arrogance of ""the Anglican Church, and maybe the Roman Catholic church, is the REAL church to ""only polytheists and pantheists"" have healthy spirituality is a demonstration of ""same song, different verse."" The ""narcisistic/addictive"" component remains the same. I know of many Christians, New Agers, etc. that could use help with potential religious addictions. This book, sadly, will turn off most of them."
4,Clarifying the last review,"Hi... this is Tia Ciferno giving some explanation for the last (kindly written) review. ""Healer of My Heart"" was our first album, and though there are surely some things I would change, we are really happy with the way the Lord helped us to create it.In that process, I DID want to include the song ""Peace."" I originally wrote it just as it is heard on the CD. But there is also another version. Years before, my wonderful music pastor, Alan Wiebe, was working on a Christmas Canata. He added a section to ""Peace"" of his own, which was great and appropriate for Christmas. When I arranged it for the Healer of My Heart CD, I omitted the Christmas addition and went back to the original version.Hope that answers the last reviewer's question! And thank you again for the great review. Drawing the listener's heart closer to the Lord was certainly our goal, and still is!"
2,A few good ideas and a lot of filler,"This book could easily have been a short article in a magazine.It has a few good ideas that are repeated. However, the real filler comes in the form of basic profiles of corporations and other organization. The majority of the book is filled with these basic listings that you could get from any internet business sight.This is a case where if I had looked at the book in a book store I would have never purchased it."
3,Hit and Miss,"About half of this album is decent. Slightly disappointing compared to the orginal ""Hail HIM."""
4,Good Charlotte Is good,"It's not the band that are posers the music is freakn awesome but some fans are posers and that gives the band a bad name, but hey posers have the right to like good music too but y'know posers are annoying."
4,Solid Book For Aspiring Writers,"Read this book a few years back looking for inspiration and got it. Ive written four books and another on the way. I found this helpful in its style and content. It is written with small chapters by different writers each telling how they write, giving tips and things that work and dont. It can be read all at once or a chapter at a time. Its worth the read for aspiring writers."
5,A taste of Argentina,"Astor Piazzola is one of the greatest contemporary tango composers. I first learned of the beauty of tango while studying in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A friend introduced me to Astor Piazzola among other great tango names: Carlos Gardel, Anibal Troilo, etc. The more traditional lovers of tango might turn their noses up at me for liking ""tango electronico,"" but I urge others to check it out. Amazon also offers such music by Gotan Project or in compilations such as the ""Tango Chillout Sessions.""The cd I received was in great shape and arrived in a timely fashion. I encourage fellow customers to frequent this business."
3,Neat toy!,"My son got this sub for his first birthday. He is now 2. Plays with it every time I bathe him. No sign of mold or mildew as with the other bath toys I have noticed. Neat toy at a neat price. Just wish all the pieces fit inside, would store much easier."
4,The sub doesn't sink,"When full of water, the sub does float right at the water line. Yes it sort of lists to one side, but what do you expect? My one and two year olds seem to like it and eagerly play with the sub and the little life boat.By the way, I've only had it for about a month but no noticeable mold or mildew yet."
2,Cheap little stocking stuffer,"I bought this item as a stocking stuffer. It served its purpose well. That said, its a rather cheap little item and after just a few uses, the child lost complete interest in it. I probably wouldn't recommend purchasing."
3,Manifold: Time was a Better Book,"I read Manifold: Time, and loved it. The Reid Malenfant in this book is NOT the Reid Malenfant in Manifold: Time. There was no story here. I'm giving it 3 stars because I really like Baxter, and I mean, it's hard for me to give someone else's novel two stars when I myself haven't written a novel. I liked his other novel too, Coalescent, but Manifold: Time is my favorite work of his. Well...it's a tie between that and Evolution."
5,Double shadows,"Obviously, when you are in binary star system you must cast double shadows, as Reid Malenfant realizes out there on Alpha Centauri. Stephen Baxters book (Space) cast at least two kinds of shadows. First there is the wonderful feeling of being an astronaut out there among the stars. And then, on a deeper level, there is the question of what it means to be a sentient living thing in the Galaxy. The Galaxy being such a big, big place with so much to explore and so much to learn about. I suppose 2001 is year 19 before the Gaijin, or so at least according to Space. 19 years before the cosmic ""let the games begin"". So there is still time to prepare for that strange environment called Space. And a good place to start preparing would definitely be the book Space. Manifold 1 (Time) was great, and this one Manifold 2 (Space) is just as good. So, now I am just looking forward to Manifold 3 (SpaceTime?). -Simon"
1,His Worst work so Far,The whole time I read it I wish I hadn't. The only point that it drove home was the absolute pointlesness of our lives. There were no characters that one could relate to and that Damn Nemto just wouldn't die! I much prefer an author such as Greg Bear who offers some hope in the face of overpowering forces.There is some fun quantum specutlation but it cannot make up for all the short commings.
2,Good God! This book is bad.,I've read a good 75% of the books that Stephen Baxter has readand they're generally pretty good....I _LOVED_ Manifold: Time. This one is so bad that I couldn't make it all the way through(I read 400 of 512 pages).It started off pretty well...the first 200 pages were reallyinteresting. Then there was a couple hundred page lull whereincreasingly weird/unbelievable stuff kept happening onlyoften enough to make me think that perhaps it will get better.I stopped when Malenfant starts hanging around with Neanderthalson some far out moon/planet peeing in his special spacesuit.(I bought a used copy....imagine how annoyed I'd be if I paidfull price for this hardcover?)
3,Works Pretty Well - Shouldn't Leak,"This flexible hose needs to do two things: 1) spray water vigorously, and 2) not leak. It sprays water pretty well, but as others have mentioned, it leaks near the shut-off valve. Mine also leaked at the hose connection, with a hose that doesn't leak when attached to other stuff. Bring a towel or two with you.We have a San-T-Flush unit in our RV which is supposed to clean out the black water tank, but the San-T-Flush system doesn't clean the plumbing. This Swivel Stik goes from toilet down to the tank so you can reach every inch of plumbing.The spinning nozzle might hit the walls of your plumbing and make alarming vibrating noises. I don't think this is much of a problem, since you can usually adjust the hose to prevent the nozzle from hitting stuff. Be prepared for some noise, though, unless your plumbing goes straight down to the holding tank with no angles.Better than nothing, for sure!"
2,poorly made but works,I got this thing hoping it would make the gages on the black tank work better and it did that but the shut off valve is lousy and it sprayed about as much water around the bathroom as it did in the tank. The hose hook up and valve are very poor. If you buy one test it outside in a bucket before you bring it in the house and spray all the walls with water. If I had bought this at Walmart I would take it back.
3,Emergers,"Although ""Emergers"" contains some excellent introductory information for the beginner, it does not contain sufficient information on fishing emerger tactics for the advanced fly fisher. I was hoping for a book that might shed some light on emerger tactics that I was not familiar with but instead was treated to what I would call a ""refresher"" on fly fishing in general. It is well written and easy to understand but missed the mark relative to my needs and expectations. With these limitations in mind I would recommend this book for those fairly new to fly fishing."
4,Why do the good bands die the fastest?,"For those interested with neo-progressive in the vein of King Crimson or darker Genesis, Sweden's Anglagard fit the modern mold without shattering it too much. This release, after the short lived but influential group had already called it quits, is a decently recorded live capsule from a '94 stateside festival which shows the band effortlessly channeling selections from their two studio outings with nearly all the mastery afforded to production work and overdubs."
3,Prefer sled dog harness for pulling.,"I started out with this harness, but when dog outgrew it I switched to sled dog harness which is now again outgrown and have to buy larger size. I have Yukon style harness for 80 # dog for sale used. contact me at toroggo at geemail dot com."
4,Women's Crystal Curve Parka - Aqua,"The jacket is very comfy and has big pockets. The only thing I hate is the zipper, which catches on the bottom and sometimes doesn't zip properly so you have to rezip it which is annoying. The jacket is warm enough (not super warm) and the additional attached underlying jacket is a nice feature so you can remove it when it's spring time. Nice jacket for the price and durable so far."
5,Great mixture of 70's pop and space rock,"Bob Calvert was such a brilliant songwriter (if not that a brillaint singer) making this album worth listening to for not just us hard-sotted space rock fans but everyone who went through (as I did) or would like to get a feel of the 70s, a brillaint album!Ad"
5,Great album,"Great music, this selection has everything. Real music from real people, and it's fun to listen to as well. Buy it."
2,Beware - Manufacturing problem,Great cd from what I could tell. I ordered and reordered Divine flow directly from amazon three times and from an outside retailer with the same manufacturing problem on all four cds. The problem is that the enlighten yin vinyasa cd is a duplicate of the meditation cd.
5,A gift to doing Yoga at home,"I have been using the Empower CD for the past 2 years. I compliment the routine with other postures, for a more advanced workout. This CD has a voice and music that lets you relax. It is a great foundation for any level. This CD has benefited my life of home Yoga."
3,Beware,"The Breathe CD is a duplicate of the Empower CD. I love both the Empower and Enlighten practices but am totally bummed out that there is a problem with the Breathe CD. If all 3 CD were as advertized, this would be an excellent value."
3,"Slow at first, but worthwhile at the end","I struggled to get through the first few chapters of this book. As someone who hasn't read many books on spirituality, I found the material a bit dry and cliched. Halfway through, the pace picked up and I could relate to his journey a bit more. Not a bad read if you can stick through until the end."
5,A Modern Mystic,"With Paul Brunton we have a combination of three things, a Journalist who writes exceedingly well, someone who understands western mystical thought and history and an ardent student of eastern mysticism. This combination produces powerful books and 'Search in Secret India' is just one of them. I recommend Paul Brunton's books to anyone who is interested in Mysticism. Just read one of them and you are sure to become a fan."
1,Entertaining but not believable,"When I first read this book, I would have rated it three or four stars. I found it engrossing, fascinating, and uplifting.I have changed my opinion after reading ""My Father's Guru"", by Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson (also featured on Amazon). Masson grew up in a family which adopted Brunton as its guru, and in his book recounts many of his own and his family's experiences with Brunton, telling a very personal story which ends in disillusionment and some bitterness.After reading Masson's book it became clear (at least to me) that Brunton fabricates much, including his own Phd. status. I now suspect that much of what Brunton wrote in ""Search in Secret India"" was also fabricated. Hence, as a work of fiction masquerading as a documentary I do not rate it very highly."
3,Leaves Something to be Desired,"Vinnie Moore has some great songs. His classical influences always shine in his music, but the compositions he played here frankly weren't very enjoyable. A notable exception is Pieces of a Picture, the 9th track. This song is just impressive, with complex intervals and a melody tying the whole piece together, this is definitely the high point of the album. I love Vinnie Moore for the accuracy of his playing, the sound of his guitar, and his classical influences, but I didn't like the songs he was playing on this CD."
5,The Best,"Time Odyssey is the best work Vinnie has done. I rank this up there up Rising Force but more cleaner and progressive. It's a shame that vinnie ignores this release. The rest of his are more rock oriented, This is progrssive."
4,"Not in style, but still amazing...","I can't even recall how many copies of this album (tape,cd...)I've gone through. At the height of senseless shred era guitar heroes, this guy actually played a lot of stuff that made musical sense. Even though I really don't play music like this anymore, I still put this cd on whenever I don't feel motivated to practice. And lemme tell ya, it'll motivate you. As far as being an ""Yngwie clone"" (it's hard to believe arguments like this are still going on), well, at least Vinnie had the sense not to get some shmuck to sing juvenile lyrics and awkward attempts at melodies over his neo-classical/fusion stylings. This is a fun record to listen to, and I think some younger players would dig hearing stuff like this. Check it out."
3,4 stars if you're a Rita Hayworth fan,"If you are a Gene Kelly fan this one might be a little disappointing-it is more of a Rita Hayworth vehicle (I believe she was a much bigger star at the time than he). However, this one has some charming moments for Kelly, even though the story is hopelessly dated (Hayworth is caught between two club owners vying for control of her talents and affections). The high points for me were the exuberent street dance with Kelly, Hayworth and Phil Silvers, and, of course, the great ""Alter-ego"" dance with Kelly and Kelly. Not a great movie, but very enjoyable (I have watched it several times)."
3,long ago & far away makes this one worth your time,"rita hayworth shines but gene kelly is drab in this typical 40s musical, with a fine score by jerome kern & ira gershwin, and great supporting work from phil silvers and eve arden, both on the brink of stardom."
3,A bit disappointing,"If you are looking for more great examples of Rita's dancing, skip this one. Of all the films of hers that I have seen this was the only one that I was a bit disappointed with. It simply didn't measure up to the hype that it was given."
2,OY VAY!,"(1) Terrible packaging.(2) Scratched DVDs.(3) ""Sadie"" and ""Salome"" are probably the worst flicks I have ever seen. When watching ""Sadie,"" I made the comment to Mrs. Shaft, ""Are we watching an Elvis Presley movie?""(4) Lots of skips in those 2 movies, and thus I returned the set to the merchant without watching any more.(5) Lousy quality control."
2,<snore>,"Ho boy! Was that boring!This is supposed to be a classic? The story was barebones formula that never drew me in. The acting didn't help (cept for Eve Arden in a too small role). The songs could still have saved it - especially with Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin collaborating - but they were tuneless and unmemorable - except for ""Long Ago and Far Away"" - but Gene Kelley's voice ruined it for me. Rita Hayworth was filmed unflatteringly -- and there went my last hope for enjoying it."
2,"Sorry, doesn't work for me...","I know I'll take all kinds of flak for saying so, but this is a dismally scripted, poorly choreographed Technicolor musical featuring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth, both at their most lackluster. Phil Silvers is also in here -- also to no great effect. In fact, Eve Arden seems to be the only actor who even seems to be trying on this one. The costumes are grotesque, the sets are minimal and even the score - a collaboration between Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin -- is a dud. Why the movie guides like this one is a mystery to me. Only one good scene, when Kelly dances alongside his spectral reflection, other than that, you're really better off searching out stronger performances in ""American In Paris"" and other classics. This flick is strictly dullsville."
3,Typical plot with a true star!,"You know that most movie musicals all have that same plot: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy and girl face some huge ordeal, then they live happily ever after. However, this one stars the magnificent, beautiful, and truly talented Rita Hayworth, our 'girl', Rusty in this one. I hadn't seen any of her films, but have always been a big fan of movie musicals and actresses from that generation.""Cover Girl"" makes me want to seek out more of Rita Hayworth."
5,"RITA, GENE, & TECHNICOLOR","THIS IS A SUPERB MOVIE!!The plot is simple, but who cares about the plot here?We want to see the dancing.I highly recommend this movie.The mastering on this DVD is excellent."
5,Great collection of the superb Rita Hayworth,These five films of Rita Hayworth are classics and the prints are beautiful and sharp. It's great to add these films to any movie goer's collection.
2,Falling apart in 6 months,Bought these same shoes six month ago for 35$ and the inside is chipping away right around the toes. They gave good comfort up until this point.
5,Awesome Shoe for the Money,Very comfortable and stylish. Goes great with business casual or with jeans. A+
5,Unlisted Black Oxford lace-ups,"Really good shoes for the sale price ($25). Very comfortable, light-weight, and casual, yet dressy enoungh to wear with slacks, shirt, and tie. Good for cruising around the block or kick'n around the house. Leather tops, rubber souls, ok tread for ice and snow. Sizes run a bit small...I wear a 9-10 size, the 9 M fit nice."
3,Decent purchase,"Good shoe, for a good value, I purchased for $25. It's comfortable and well built, but it is also quite plain. It will not attract any attention or make anyone believe it's worth more than $25, but it if you're just looking for a comfortable business casual type shoe, this is a good choice."
3,OK I Guess,"They are comfortable, light and easy to put on. They lack that real professional look and they don't shine very well. Whilst they are cheap I was looking for a little bit more."
4,Good shoe for budget-conscious shoppers,"I've been looking to buy some brown dress shoes for some time now. Usually I end up being disappointed by the quality of dress shoes--even pricier brands--because they end up being all flash and no comfort. These Unlisted Seam Roller Oxfords, however, are a different story. Sure, they look great, but as an Amazon shopper you knew that already. They also feel great. The footbed is very comfortable, the sole is intelligently shaped, and the upper has enough lacing to tighten if necessary.The only downside to these shoes is the durability of the sole. The soles appear to be some type of soft rubber, which isn't a big deal unless you walk everywhere, like me. Also, because of the ridged design of the sole, I wasn't able to attach 'wear protectors/heel taps' to these shoes.The bottom line: this is a great shoe for the money, and it's a great fit for all but the most strenuous walkers."
5,Fantastic Value,The shoes came exactly as ordered and a perfect fit. They are even better than I expected--a fantastic value!!
4,great shoe for less,What more can I say. This is a great shoe for the low low. Very comfortable and stylish. If you don't believe me ask my feet : ).....
1,DVD didn't work.,"The item was late, and when I tried it , it didn't work.So, I was never able to play it. How do I get a credit or return it. Actually, I would like another copy that works."
2,Clunky Dialogue,"We did watch this in 2011 and it hasn't aged well. The dialogue was bad, very cliched, especially Ms. Pfieffer's. Fun seeing Mel Gibson and Kurt Russell young again. Haven't seen Michelle Pfeiffer in ages to know how she has aged. Her wardrobe was fun to see in this. Reminded me of my own back-in-the-day!"
5,Tequila Sunrise,"Great movie, come on....who doesn't like Kirk Russel, Mel Gipson and Michelle Pfeiffer? You cant loose."
5,Steamy and suspenseful,"The love scene in Tequila Sunrise is the most erotic in all of Hollywood. There is barely any nudity and just the suggestion of smut. But, the fast/slow motion, sexy sax, and excellent cinematography make the whole movie a joy. The plot is great and the acting is phenominal."
2,well made and stylish . . .,"But for me at least, I found it rather hard to root for Mel Gibson's character, given the fact that he was a major, major drug dealer. When the movie ended with him more or less riding off into the sunset with Michelle Pfeiffer and all the loot, I didn't find myself feeling exactly uplifted by it. Given the fact that the movie bent over backwards to depict Gibson as a loving father, a phenomenally successful businessman, and a super-stud, one might fairly say that this movie glamorizes drug-dealing."
4,Good Thriller Mel Gibson looks tooclean cut for drug dealing,"A Well done film with a somewhat twisted storyline about a a reformed drug dealer Mac,(Gibson)who is trying to get away from the drug life but his longlife best friend Nick Frescia(Russell) who happens to be head of the Narcotics divison of the L.A.P.D is persuaded by a crooked FBI Agent(Walsh) to manufacture evidence agaisnt Mac To put him away for good. Romance Is brought in to the film by the ever so beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Jo Anne, the ... Resteraunter who is caught between Mac & Nick. The villan Carlos Played by the late Raul Julia did a fantastic job in portraying a sinister villan adding just a touch of humor to the role. The story is often times confusing but the chemistry between the leads makes up for it. This story is more about personal loyalties and regaining indivdual honor. With all the roles well written TEQUILA SUNRISE Is a film that should not be missed."
5,One of my Favorite movies!,"I love this movie - have every line memorized! What great actors for fantastic characters. Many classic moments of suspence, romance and comedy."
4,Great Cast Makes for a Great Movie,"Tequila Sunrise is one of the few action movies that you can watch until the end without ever getting tired of the fast-paced plot involving crime, drugs, money, etc. The dialouge is intense, the actors are great, and the plot doesn't drag on. Michelle Pfieffer and Mel Gibson show great chemistry, and also Raul Julia has a minor role that really showed his talent. This movie is a real fun one to watch. I'd reccomend it to any fan of action, or lover of great scripts."
4,Slick!,"One of my favorite Mel Gibson movies. The look is gorgeous, pure eye candy. The hot tub scene is worth the price!"
4,an oasis,"simply beautiful. a musical oasis that transports you to another place. a place of beauty,serenity, thoughtfulness and quiet reflection. this cd is a must for your collection..."
1,a big disappointment,"I bought this filter belt for a Emerson drum type humidifier HDP-1, When it arrived i noticed it was nothing like the original filter belt I had been using, it is very light weight and seemed to have a lot of stretch to it. After about one weeks use it was completely deformed from the weight of the water and was totally useless. Buying this filter belt was a waste of money. If I could rate it no stars I would."
3,Herman Holtz updated for the late nineties,"Holtz's general consulting guide has been updated for the new millenium with this new concise edition. Notice it is concise, perhaps in deference to the whole notion of the lack of reading time our contemporary business environment. Nevertheless the book is packed full of advice about the nuts and bolts of consulting and the perspective is useful to experienced consultants as well as beginners..I was struck by two issues that are emphasized in the book. There is lots of attention paid to the notion of continuous marketing. According to Holtz, most businesses fail because of a lack of a marketing strategy; they just don't have enough sales. The other emphasis is an in-depth discussion of consulting to government agencies at the local, state and federal levels"
2,Not So Concise,"I have to admit that there was some useful information in the book. Especially in setting fees, importance of retainers, the current outlook towards the consulting industry. While Mr. Holtz does have a great amount of knowledge, that can be quickly seen in the text, I find his writing style lacking and even frustrating. Many subjects appear in the book multiple times - a rehashing of subjects he has already discussed. This, and the back and forth references of subject matter was disconcerting. I think that if the duplication of information was removed from the book, the nearly 300 page book would be about 25% smaller."
2,Doesn't Measure Up...,"I agree with the other reviewers: there are many other books that cover the material in more detail and in far fewer pages. I'd recommend Alan Weiss' ""Million Dollar Consulting"" or Alan's ""Getting Started in Consulting."" Either of these books should be considered a MUST addition to any consultant's library. Overall grade: D+/C-"
3,Good story but sloppy e-copy,"The Kindle version of this book is so full of typos that it starts to become a distraction. In fact, if it weren't for all of the typographical errors, I would have given the book 5 stars.The story itself is quite good. Even though it was written in the 30's, the language is still fresh. I found it to be as well written as Dracula or Frankenstein, and definitely easier to read than the latter. The plot is a little predictable, but that is true of all of the horror genre archetypes. At it's current price of $2.99, this book is worth reading."
3,Changes as often as a werewolf.,"Endore's book starts out well enough, with a slice of history that leaves your stomach turning. From there, the book goes down-hill. The supporting characters might as well be cardboard cut-outs, for all of their personality. Then, towards the middle of the book, the author starts introducing historical information about the revolution taking place during the books time period. Though the revolution does effect the characters, the way that Endore completely throws the plot out the window to focus on the history is terribly excessive. The single thought-provoking idea that Endore does discuss is this: who are the real werewolves? Is it the man who changes when there is a full moon, or is it you and I when we're at our worst? I would recommend this book to a history buff, but if you're simply on the look-out for a good thriller, look elsewhere."
1,The typesetting for this edition is awful,"Great book, of course, but for this edition Oxford used a computer to justify the type. On every other line you encounter three or four spaces where there should be only one. It may not bother most readers, but I'm looking for another publisher's edition."
4,Victorian Lit at its Height!,"This was a wonderful book. The characters are deep and very well developed. Daniel is a little too good to be true, but Gwendolen is the best female character of the time period. She goes through an amazing metamorphosis from spoiled brat to concerned woman. Daniel marrie Mirah because she is his kind and acceptable for him to marry for the time. Jews did not marry English Christians in the 1800's. As a Historian i would know about it. Read this book and watch the PBS companion series from 2002 , it was great!"
5,George Eliot was so CRUEL!!,"I couldn't finish the book.George Eliot was so cruel in shaping Gwendolen's life.Why didn't Daniel choose her rather than that stupid Jewish girl?Wasn't she pathetic at the time?The author gave Rosamond in Middlemarch a rather good living,why not Gwendolen in this book?Besides,in many ways she had surpassed Rosamond.JESUS...I can't stand it!!"
5,Best of the Spear,"Although his 100th Anniversary album (Marcus Garvey b/w Garvey's Ghost) is SO crucial, this dub album (of the vocal album Social Living) is probably my favorite dub work from Burning Spear. The echo and dub effects are well chosen, the tracks are heavy and rootsy and overall this is an astounding album. Always one of my top picks to my freinds."
2,Not worth the trouble!,"Stoll's book is a mixed bag; unfortunately, most of it is bad. While many of his points about the affect of computers in the classroom are valid and confirmed by my time in education, the good points are mired in a nearly unreadable stream-of-consciousness writing style that reeks more of ""bitter old coot"" rather than ""scientist and educator"". Without the harsh tone, there's some good stuff in here. Most of that stuff, however, is pretty obvious and not worth wading through this book to find."
3,"Good ideas, but over the top","I liked this book, but I think that the author could have done a much better job expressing his ideas. This book will alienate most of the people that it shouldn't through the use of its language and rabid sentiment. It is a shame!"
4,Different Views of Frankenstein,"When the name Frankenstein is heard the majority of the people, myself included, do not look at or see the political or social issues that affected the world in the 1800s as well as today. The story is about a scientist who becomes obssessed with the idea of playing god, creating another human life. Victor rejects his creation causing the monster to not receive the love and affection that he needs. I liked how the book allowed you to use your imagination when it came to what the monster looked like. Frankenstein is timeless novel that forces you to think about what scares you most in life."
4,A book for all ages...,"Frankenstein is a book for all ages. Frankenstein has shown versatility throughout its life. This book has been adapted by its readers to represent all eras. It offers the reader a look not only into the past but also to the near future. With such things as the Human Gnome project in mid-flourish Frankenstein has yet again opened the eyes of its readers. The horror is not in the story but is in the representation it presents to us today. Technology, science, love, and when you throw in the ambition of ""Victor"" you can closely relate to this tale. Mary Schelley may have never intended for Frankenstein to be a book into the subconscious, or a representation of Marxist ideologies and various other criticism, but it has lend itself to be a perfect subject for study. Frankenstein is truly a book worthy of reading by the most critical of readers."
3,Abandon you creation. Let it provide for itself. Curse it.,"I didn't like the main character at all. He took no responsibility for devoloping the humanity of the being he created. He abandoned and later betrayed it meanwhile cursing the creature for its actions. The daemon, learned and soulful, might have offered much to humanity besides the evil that Victor had condemned it behind its isolation and deformity. By itself, the daemon could not overcome its exterior despite its attempts. Not being accepted by humanity because of its appearance, the daemon teaches us despite how noble intentions may be that people often let appearance get in the way. I wonder whether the daemon would have accepted in a leper colony."
3,Might as well buy the RHCE book by jang (4th edition),"I bought the RHCE book (jang 4th edition) and used it to study for the RHCE exam. Because the exam encompasses both the RHCT abd RHCE exam, i thought i could use the RHCT book as a way to refine skills geared strictly towards just the RHCT portion of the exam. This book really is just a subset (cut and paste) of the RHCE book from jang, with a very few changes. You are better off just getting the RHCE book by jang and using it to study for both the RHCT and RHCE. The skills you learn, although not super in depth, will force you to learn or relearn key concepts that will potentially be on the exam."
4,As good as can be expected,I bought this book knowing it was for an older exam. It was helpful in getting up to speed on Red Hat Linux and related variants.
5,fantastic,"The service and product was much more than I could ever hope for. Fast and dependable. Even added a personal note. Was a nice gesture. Little things mean alot. Would buy from again gladly and well as soon as I eat all the bars. Again, buy with confidence from the Shirleys!! Five stars easily."
4,nice enough,"nice subs, could be better. they do a good job for 2 10's in a minivan, but am left wanting more."
1,One of the best teacher's ever.,"My teacher had us read this book. And really I don't know why he had us read it! Anne Sullivan grows up in a poorhouse with her brother Jimmie. Anne was there for about six years, Jimmie died there. When Anne was 15 she went to Pirkins school for the blind. Anne became half blind from a disease. When she graduated she went to help Helen Keller. I realy wouldn't recommend the book. It's really long and get's kind'a boring. It's o.k. so you can read it if you want. Don't just take my advice, check the other book reviews."
4,Wow this is a great biography,Hellen Kellers Teacher was a great book. I liked it because it had a lot of dialouge and lots of interesting facts I had never known That were about Annie her teacher. Annie was blind when she was little so she knew what Helen felt like. Most people concentrate on Helen but this is all about her teacher. I would recomend this to any 3rd 4th or 5th grader.
3,Good Boigraphy If You Don't Want Too Much Detail,"This is an excellent biography if you want a good amount of information about Annie Sullivan but not too much. It isn't a simple one page or two page list of facts but it won't go over ever-single detail in Annie Sullivan's life. After all, it's only 153 pages, hardly a novel. It's well written but not a difficult read. It really tells about Annie Sullivan's life, not just the time she spent with Helen Keller. For example, it talks a lot about her childhood and the time she spent in the Perkins Institution. In fact only half of the book is spent talking about her time with Helen. The first half is spent telling about Annie's struggles with her disabilities. I recommend this if you are looking for a quick, yet engaging read about Annie Sullivan."
5,Purrrrrfect.,"Must run it through the washing machine first. Get rid of all the fuzzies this will leave behind. The quality, texture and size are amazing, and for the sale price on Amazon, totally worth it."
2,"It is really soft, but also sheds too much","The blanket is very soft. I'll give it that. But the fibers keep coming out. I've even washed it twice and tumble dried it like the instructions say and I still find little purple bits of blanket on my sofa, floor, clothes.If you really want to buy one make sure you get a color thats not as noticible as plum if you have light colored furniture/carpets."
3,Bad shipping or Very old stock,"This is our 2nd purchase bought 2 at a time as we really liked our 1st one. But are really disappointed with this purchase. As the shipment arrived we opened the blankets to see they damp and we could see the fungus developed on the cover of the sheets.Either the blankets were from a very old stock or the shipping was not taken care properly. If it was the shipping, the carton box was quiet dry but the blankets we were damp and smelling. Quiet not satisfied with this purchase."
1,What a mess,I washed this per the instructions and man what a mess. Little purple pills everywhere. So I washed it two more times. Seemed to be getting worse. Gave up. No good for me.
5,A very comfy blanket!,"The Sharpay blanket is very plush and very warm. In fact, if you keep your house warm at all in the wintertime, I would not recommend this blanket. I keep my home thermostat set at 65 degrees, and this blanket, a sheet and a quilt is all that my 16-year old (who likes to be warm when she sleeps) needs. My one suggestion would be to wash this blanket before putting it on the bed. Otherwise, you'll end up with colored fuzz all over your sheets. All in all, it's one of the best buys in blankets that I've found in a long time."
3,Too many extreme close-ups,"This could have been a 5-star DVD for kids, but the camera man does too many close-ups of the machines...like close-ups of the treads on the bulldozer or the wheels on the trucks. Just about the time the machines start doing their jobs the camera man zooms in or the scene changes to another machine. Maybe this is a problem with the editor? My 3 yrs old grandson doesn't ask to watch these DVDs as often as he does some of his other ""tractor"" DVDs"
4,Boys Love Big Machines,"My two boys ages 4 and 5 just love these videos. They are a great part of our collection. For the money you recieve 4 dvd's that the kids have hours of enjoyment watching. The vidoes have an array of big machines that all kids love, bulldozers, backhoes, dump trucks you name it. Great gift for the little ones that love those monster machines."
3,"Bag is not as advertised, set is nice enough","I'll be honest: The primary reason I chose this set over the other similarly priced ones was because I liked the cream-coloured canvas tote. It looked so beachy, so Eddie Bauer.So I was disappointed to discover that the tote that arrived was in fact a drab dark green, and is actually very ill suited to carrying around a set of bocce balls.The balls themselves are just what I expected..."
4,A wonderful history,"Greyhounds have been around for thousands of years and Ms. Branigan covers their history very well. More conversational than scholarly, this is easily read and can used as a ready reference to pick and choose any particular portion of the greyhounds long and varied story, The author clearly has an affection for the breed that shows throughout. If you have greyhounds or want to know more about these wonderful companions, this volume is one you should have."
2,Not up to the others,"Papa Bear has his heart set on winning the prize for the biggest pumpkin. He waters his pumpkin and fertilizes it, and even talks to it. Mama tries to get his mind off winning, and get him to focus on the beauties of nature and the coming Thanksgiving holiday, but Papa is grimly determined to win the pumpkin contest.Unlike most Berenstain Bear books, this one is all about Papa. Brother and Sister Bear are minor characters this time, so the book loses a lot of its kid-appeal. We don't really care whether Papa wins the prize or not, and Mama's message about Thanksgiving is diluted. For a good Berenstain Bear book about Thanksgiving, seeThe Berenstain Bears Give Thanks. For a Halloween book, seeThe Berenstain Bears Trick or Treat.."
3,Not Enough Substance.,"Sandwiched between the mass marketing of Halloween and Christmas, Thanksgiving is often looked upon as being nothing more than the day Christmas shopping begins. The whole reason behind Thanksgiving (taking one day out of the year to give thanks to God for all the blessing we have in our lives), just like Christmas, Halloween, and most other holidays is often lost in the superficialities of the day, e.g. parades and football games.Those petty events are summed up in THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE PRIZE PUMPKIN as Papa Bear gets caught up in growing the biggest pumpkin in Bear Country for a pumpkin contest the weekend before Thanksgiving. In the process, Papa totally forgets the true meaning of the holiday, but is reminded at the end by Mama and Sister Bear.The book is a nice little story. However, for a book about Thanksgiving, it doesn't talk about giving thanks enough."
5,God's Anointed!!,"Completely inspired by our Father, the songs in this CD reflect God's Word, Promises, and Purpose upon the lives of those who love Him. Each time you listen to the message behind every song in this CD, your life will truly be blessed. Buy it, cause you will not want to stop listening to it!"
5,New Song,"This CD is amazing!!! These artist have an incredible sound that is certain to ""Move"" you. Every song on this CD speaks to you. While most CD's have maybe 3 songs that are worth listening to, Every song on this CD is a Hit. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves good music that touches not only the heart but the very soul.PSIf you haven't seen them in Concert yet, it is a must!!!! Not many Christian Artists can be placed in the category of Ministers too, but they have great Stage presence as well as usher in His Presence."
1,Questionable Durability,"This unit features a chintzy detachable faceplate with way too much give - press it near the volume button and you can raise or lower volume; press it near the tuner controls and you can change stations. Not good. Four months after installation I was getting sound crackling and drop-offs. Then it mysteriously stopped emitting any sound at all. I sent it in to Sony and they claimed the unit had ""water damage."" Another mystery...no water had every touched this unit, no spills, nothing. Sony wouldn't replace the unit as ""water damage"" isn't covered on their warranty.When the unit worked, it did work fine. Decent display, features, etc. But it's durability (I can't give it more than 1 star: I had it installed in the middle of June and it stopped working at the end of November) is terrible."
4,Around the world in stone.,"Lots of history on stone shelters from around the world. Could be more photo's, and colour ones would be better yet."
1,Crystal tea serving set,"This is very tiny. No way can it be used to serve tea in. It's more like a toy; however, it is very pretty, but not what I thought it would be. It did, however, come to me in mint condition."
1,Mysterious Broken Tea Set,"I received this package well wrapped but it was broken. It was a small tea set looking much smaller than I suspected. The top of the tea pot and the spout of the tea pot were broken off when they arrived. The mystery is that I contacted UPS and the seller with my complaint. I followed all their demands, rewrapped and gave it back to UPS and have heard nothing back. I don't know if they will give me my money back or if it is just a loss."
4,"Lovely, but little!","This is a very small set, but it is very pretty. Because it was such a good price and looked so lovely, I don't really mind the size. I'm sure that you may be able to use it to serve tea, but for me it's just too small for practical use."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,"WOW!Is the word that came to mind when I first listened to Mariea's CD. And as I listen to it again and again the word that continuously comes to mind is WOW!! Mariea is the best Harpist On The Planet-bar none! Her smooth grooves seems to calm the worst day's storms. Mariea will take you on an incredible journey into paradise...where you simply forget all your worries and let her music play on and on. But don't ley the smooth taste fool you- Mariea really grooves on this one. Her redention of ""You Are Everything"", ""On The Wings Of Love"", ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"", And Her Funky title trac ""Sexy Paradise"" is spellbounding. I had to ask sincerely... is she really playing a Harp?WOW-This is Mariea Antoniette...believe me this one you've got to hear for yourself! But, don't take my word for it, get your very own copy. I cannot wait for her next project...but until then I will wear this CD out...as it plays on and on! GUARANTEED!MARIEA-I LIKE YOUR GROOVE! YOU GO GIRL!!!"
1,Hard to use,"I love the idea of this... sleek, out of the way for transit butreadily available on the road, protected when not in use. Unfortunately,the reality is a hard to use product that does little to improve road safety.Because of the narrowness of the mirror, it's very difficult to focus on whatis actually behind you with a quick glance. Sure, if you sit there for 10seconds you can figure it out, but I don't have that sort of time when I'mdodging through Chicago traffic!Save your money and buy the excellent Mirrcycle instead."
1,"Great concept, but tiny distorted mirrors don't work",Mirrors are too small and too distorted. The picture on the package shows a perfect reflection - as if!!It's about as useful as taping two foil-wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them.
2,Mirrors too small to see anything.....,hard to get them out and lined up to see traffic and they stick out to far. As just handles they work fine.
1,Mirror completely unusable,I bought these solely for the mirror feature instead of other cheaper or more ergonomic bar ends.The mirror portion is COMPLETELY USELESS.
2,Not a big help,"No, it doesn't work like it shows in the picture. It is really difficult to make any use of these in my daily rides around town.Riding out in the country I do make a little use of the bar ends for changes in posture. They have a good solid mount."
2,Not a functional rear-view mirror.,"I put a set of these on my Bianchi hybrid. The mirrors have too much distortion, because they are plastic, and are too thin (vertical dimension) to be useful for seeing much of anything behind. The correct angle for viewing is nearly impossible to set while riding. For bar-end-grips-while-cruising, the aluminum frames (black part) seem as sturdy as any bar-end grips I have seen, but are cold and unpadded. They are functional grips, that is, right up until I hook a branch or a telephone grounding wire or something!!BUT, they are an elegant idea that I'm sure will evolve into something that works. My suggestion is wider (the short dimension) mirrors, made out of glass, and padded black frames--somehow."
4,Works Great!,"The mirrors are small and take a little getting used to, but once a rider becomes accustomed to the viewing area, they work great! They are small and compact and are out of the way when you don't want to use them. The bar ends are stable and are great to lean on. I love these!"
4,Steps,"Excellent book, but the Kindle version is rife with typographial errors. An author of Kosinski's stature, a book of this import, deserves better."
2,"Good book, awful conversion in ebook","The book is good, full of twisted scenes and strange dialogues.What is terrible is the quality of the ebook conversion, probably made with OCR.A lot of missing full stops, wrong words (i.e. ""real"" becomes ""red""), and even asterisks when there shouldn't be.You better buy the paperback version..."
5,A Masterpiece,"Kosinski, or the Kosinski committee or whatever it was (Paul Auster is one of many who claim to have been paid to 'fix up' his early drafts), wrote some psychologically fascinating and beautifully written stuff (The Painted Bird, Steps, and to a lesser extent, Cockpit and The Devil Tree) and some really bad stuff (Pinball, The Hermit of Whatever-it-was-th Street). This is probably the best of them all. Buy it."
4,A great ethnographic study of a misunderstood ethnic group.,"Due to its nature as an ethnographic study the book will apear as a dry relation of facts. However, the book carries get weight and is used in University Anthropology classes."
4,Great Overall Text on the Algebra of Matrix Differentiation,"I have read a number of texts on matrix differentiation, and this one ranks as my favorite. Its key strength is its completeness. In fact, it has sections entitled ""Old Results"", which contain the more standard material on Kronecker products and the like, and one entitled ""New Results"" which contain nice results about any type of tensor contraction described in a matrix format.Its drawback is that it needs to be rewritten using Latex or some other standard typesetting language. The typesetting is a bit off-putting."
4,A weird look at our world from decades ago,"A bomb when released in the 1980's, viewers today can find fascinating parallels to Connery's CNN-type globe-hoping journalist and news events today. Decades before it arrived, Middle East terrorism, news manipulation and what is more important, the truth or ratings? Connery is his usual self-assured self supported by Katherine Ross as a CIA operastive, George Grizzard as the President, Leslie Nielson as the Senator looking to be President (again), Henry Silva as a Mommar Quadafi type , Hardy Kruger as a man with A-Bombs for sale, Dean Stockwell as a Presidential aide and Robert Conrad as Gen. Wombat."
4,Get your scorecard,"Get your scorecard out so you can try and keep track of who is the evil person and who is not. This is a black comedy and really does get too close to the truth about how things are probably done in the halls of Washington and other locales.Sean Connery plays to reporter who is going to get to the bottom of a story - no matter what. There is a good support cast who draws the viewer into the story, and the movie flows from one twist and betrayal to the next, right up to the end - where the ultimate twist is waiting.The comparison to ""Wag The Dog"" is understandable, but one must remember that this movie came out years before ""Dog."""
5,"Before ""Wag the Dog,"" there was this satirical look.","Connery stars as a globetrotting reporter in this film which predates both CNN and ""Wag the Dog"". Viewers will note the similarities between the fabricated war against the Middle Eastern despot here, and the fictional conflict against Albania in Wag the Dog. Both films are uncomfortably close to the truth, especially in light of the new bombing of Iraq."
4,"A Comedy about Middle Eastern Terrorists & Nukes,","Iamgine in 1983 someone making a movie set in a not too distant future where violence has become a national pastime. (XFL,WWF, Real TV?)A world famous international war correspondent (Connery)becomes swept up in the CIA's search for Iranian nuclear weapons in the US...For a movie that has a ton of stars, including Sean Connery,its odd that no one has ever heard of ""Wrong Is Right"".Released just before the huge advent of home VCRs this would have fared much better with today's headlines as a background. A black comedy in 1983, in retrospect it poses some fascinating questions about todays society & how eerily accurate its humorous predictions turned out to be.Its a good beer & popcorn movie, especially if you like political humor."
4,Entertaining and phophetic satire,"I don't know why the Amazon reviewer did not like this film. Since I have not seen ""Network,"" I can't make comment on his comparison. I took this film for what it was supposed to be, a satire on our relations with middle eastern oil-rich nations and the US response to the possibility of terrorism. This is a tongue-in-cheek look at journalism, our government, intelligence, and patriotism gone awry. I never really liked Robert Conrad as an actor, but I loved him in this film as General Wombat. Rosalind Cash makes a beautiful and savvy vice president. We get a peek at Tyne Daly at the beginning of her career. This is not an Academy Award winning movie, just cynical entertainment."
5,A famous accompianist has his day...,"Normally you might expect to have this artist at the end of the personnel list, but here he is at the beginning:Ron Carter, bass;Kenny Barron, piano;Hugh McCracken, keyboards + harmonica on ""Woolaphant"";Harvey Mason, drums;plus a string section.Arrangements by Ron Carter and Don Sebesky.Recorded October 18-19 1976 and mixed at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley.Digitally remastered in 1991 at Fantasy Studios (this recording).What a line up of music and musicians! If you enjoy these artists I recommend you add it to your collection right away! If you have any doubts, listed to the samples above -- my favorite is One Bass Rag."
1,Not worth the cost!,"I was very disappointed in this product!! It took about 2 minutes for my dog to eat the ""Healthy Edibles""."
4,"Good, basic resource for helping shy children","I found much of this book to be very helpful, with some great tips on helping the shy child. My child is on the very extreme end of being shy, with some SID to make matters worse. Even so, I thought this book had enough helpful items to make the purchase worthwhile. I'd also like to say something about another reviewer's comment that the book doesn't mention Asperger's Syndrome. This reviewer thought it was a serious ommission on the author's part not to mention AS. However, in the author's defense, I think it should be noted that this book was originally written in 1982, well before most people/professionals became aware that there even was such as thing as Aspgerger's Syndrome. That didn't happen until the 1990's, ten years after this book was written."
3,Shy people should read this.,I'm a very shy person. My dad got this for me before I went to college. When I read this book I was surprised what they found out about shyness. And there are different types of shyness. It gave good tips how to over come it. Even though how old it is. But I still thought it was very helpful.
5,Poco Loco,"A little crazy in Tuscon 72....""A'int that a lot of love"" permiated the air way..all of 1 underground station in town at that time...and what a time!! this Album is one of the best ""live"" albums ever recorded.....its like the man said "" if you were'nt there you really do not know what its' all about."" But this album takes you back there in every energetic cut ..why they do'nt release"" Last of the Flyin Red Hot Burritos"" is a great mystery...."
5,Great Album,"The LIVE version of these songs are awesome. This is the best that this band could play, and it is all here on tape. Try it, you will like it."
5,This is one of the finest live albums ever recorded.,"I only have this record on vinyl & I hope to find it on a cd some day soon. It has one of the best bluegrass recordings on it: ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown"". In addition to the Bluegrass found on this record, this Country Rock classic is the closest some of us ever came to seeing Gram and the band live and every time I hear it, it makes me glad I'm still a fan today. I am holding on to my 3rd vinyl copy. Please reissue soon.!! MQ Riding"
3,last of the red hot buritos,the quality of the CD is ok the bonus tracks are burned at a different volume than the rest of the CD. I have to admit that I don't understand why it takes so long to travel to Canada through the Postal Service. The pony express could have left from Texas and gotten to Vancouver BC Canada quicker than this CD did by regular post. The time factor has left me a little jaded and reluctant to do this again. Sorry for the not so glowing review but I have to be honest with you.
2,Not so hot!,"By the time this album came out, most of the original Burritos had flown. Chris Hillman and Michael Clarke are here, along with replacements Al Perkins (who plays steel guitar admirably) and guitarist/vocalist Rick Roberts, as well as a few other players who really shouldn't be here. It seems that Hillman wanted to turn the Burritos into a quasi-bluegrass band (which would never have happened under Gram Parsons). The first three cuts are excellent, but things go downhill quite rapidly from there. The annoying Byron Berline and a couple of his bluegrass pals horn in with a series of fairly well-played but dreadfully out-of-place bluegrass tunes, while the remainder of the album is devoted to lackluster rock. If you want to hear bluegrass, listen to Bill Monroe, who does it better than Berline and his hacks; if you want to hear the Burritos at their best, this is not the album for you. Two stars for the first three cuts, and none for the rest."
2,"Pretty, but very wide","These looked like cute shoes in the picture, but when they arrived, they were too wide, even wider than a regular medium."
4,A bouncy mix of new hits and classic favorites!,"I was surprised by the number of quality songs on this soundtrack. Regardless of the target audience of the movie, the music in this collection is delightfully upbeat, optimistic, and just plain fun. Remixes of 80s hits ""Freeze Frame"" and ""Heaven Is a Place on Earth"" actually manage to surpass their originals with jazzy female vocalists and great background music. ""That's What Girls Do"" is a cute song that is also quite funny. Finally, the Hope 7 original ""I Want Everything"" is a great song about never giving up on your dreams and is certaintly a great theme song for kids on Christmas. :)"
3,I never understood soundtracks.,"Soundtracks are an odd thing, unless you are using music excusively to the movie (Like the score), but if it's a compilation of just random songs used in the movie, then it doesn't usually work. This is mostly average power pop. You know, stuff that sounds just like Blink-182 and the such, with a couple of 80's songs in between. Allister's remake of We Close Our Eyes makes me cringe, Oingo Boingo's version is much better. Overall, this is just a boring power pop (Mostly) soundtrack, but if you're into that kinda stuff, I guess you'd enjoy it..."
1,Very odd,"This is pretty odd to me... ALOT of albums has some missing songs... but I do like this movie but when I listen Music Sampler... these songs were pretty slow... I guess I am more into club, remixes, house, techno, dance that has some good beat like ""Hole In The Head"" by Sugababes and ""Heaven Is A Place On Earth"" by Becky Baeling (I am just giving you an example what kind of beat that I like)... so far I only like 2 songs off this album but I said to myself its not worth to buy it because it has 11 songs on this album and I only like 2 songs... is it worth for me to buy it?? dont think so!!"
2,Yellowcard?,"What happened to the songs that were ''supposedly'' sung by yellowcard??? did those guys just sing someone else's cheesy song?? i dunno, man, this is weird.this is a really goomy soundtrack, btw. dont buy it pleaaasee."
3,Sleepover Soundtrack,"I think that the CD is kind of cool and kind of not. It sort of dissapointed me because I thought that the songs would be better, but they weren't. Some of the songs like ""I Want Everything"" by Hope was really cool and pepy, That's one of my favorites. I think if you want to buy it you should listen to ALL of the Song samples FIRST, before buying it. Now that I've listened to it I don't really want to buy it anymore."
4,"Entertaining, light reading for the sports fan","With the large number of people interviewed, it is not surprising that it was fairly easy for a collection of outstanding quotes to be prepared. This book contains many of them and it is easy, light reading for the sports junkie. As befits the breadth of ESPN, all sports are covered and at all levels. The quotes are funny, serious, and occasionally on the edge of incomprehensible. However, in all cases they are entertaining, which makes this book one that you can reread with pleasure several times."
5,The Quotes,"""If your scoring alone or if your alone,"" you are sure to enjoy Quotable ESPN... It's ""en Fuengo"" when it comes to the names/sayings of ESPN. So don't ""Drewl the drewl of remorse onto the pillow of regret""! Pick up your copy of Quotable ESPN today!"
2,Poorly designed,"Rubber pulls on the zippers broke. It doesn't feel right or sit comfortably as a side bag because of its huge size. It might be due to the fact it was first designed to be a backpack but refitted as a side bag, would have been nice to have both options. Good for storage of big electronic items, but not for using for everyday living because it lacks any small compartments. I bought it looking for a solution for a bag that can be used for many things (i'm a mobile DJ), but its not easy to remove each piece and looks funny without certain parts."
1,Awful film!,"This is probably the most disappointing video I have EVER seen. How they managed to take the life of this brilliant performer, and make it so painfully boring is truly beyond me, yet they did. The few good moments of the movie are the actual clips of Andy's performances, however even these are marred by voice-overs and awful music. Listen to me and the other reviewers and save your money. It will be much better spent buying ANY other Kaufman video or book."
2,very disappointed,"A documentary on Andy Kaufman with actual sketches are present, but the narrator continuously speaks over the footage preventing the viewer from hearing Andy's performances. The narration, in my opinion shouldve been done during still pictures and the actual live scenes would have been self explanatory."
1,Terrible waste of time and money!,"I'm brand new to the Andy Kaufman band wagon. Hoping to spend as little money as possible while purusing a local video store, I happened upon this one. All it is, is a narrator with an incredibly boring, insomnia-healing voice give a 35 minute account of Andy's life. While there are several hilarious clips featuring Kaufman, his voice is nearly always drowned out by the super-boring narrator. Considering the pranks and antics of this unpredictable showman (who did not like to be referred to as a comedian), he probably would have laughed his head off at the people who actually bought this video. This video ranks right up there with Andy trying to get ABC to purposefully screw up the reception for his Special. Please, especially if (like me) you're a newcomer, stay away from this one. Go with the ""Midnight Special"" instead. It's great Kaufman humor and also very clean humor (something you just don't find nowadays)."
1,I Should Have Read the Reviews!,The technical quality of this tape is terrible! The content isn't much better.
3,GOOD NOT BAD,I just recently saw this movie and its not bad some of the clips on this I had never seen before. The only problem was there was to much still images. And what are you talking about this guys voice I was expecting some weird voice its god dam normal. Plus its worth the price.
4,For 4 or 8 GA wire,If you use 4 GA wire you will not be able to get the outer rubber gasket that goes around the wire to seat 100% properly. This holder will work with 8 Ga wire and smaller as it has spaceing adaptors inside where you clamp down the set screw. Remember to order a fuse as well. The mounting base is small so you will have to slightly angle in your mounting screws. The shaft of your drill bit extenstion and body of the fuse holder will not allow you to come in at a 90 degree angle. I put a small washer around my mounting screws (not included) incase the plastic base split on mounting. Buy wire loom as well to protect your wire. Overall best price on the market and and you can use multiple ga wire.
4,Great family fun!,"""Dunston Checks In"" is great family fun. The plot involves a chimp who wreaks havoc in a five-star Manhattan Hotel and befriends the manager's young sons in the process. Warm-hearted, funny, and quite entertaining for ages 4 and up. The chimp and his antics are adorable and the acting is quite good, featuring performances by Jason Alexander (as the hotel manager), Faye Dunaway (as a Leona Helmsley-like hotel owner), Rupert Everett (as Dunston's owner), and Pee-Wee Herman."
5,Great movie for the family.,"I think that this movie is a great movie for the family. Very funny, fun to watch, I personally loved it. Jason Alexander did a terrific job in this movie, and the kids + the monkey are ADORABLE."
1,Additional postage was due by the customer,We ordered a DVD and paid $2.98 postage when it was ordered. It arrived with postage due. $1.39 postage was on the package and $1.73 postage due. I had to pay the mailperson.
3,"Unless you're 7, you might want to check out","When young Eric (Kyle Grant) befriends an orangutan named Dunston (played by Sam) in a luxury lodge, he soon learns that the ape has been trained to perform acts of larceny throughout the 4-star hotel and the mystery of who owns him unfolds. The manager (Jason Alexander) is under scrutiny to gain a coveted 5th star when Dunston checks in, and everything goes upside down thanks to the sticky-fingered orange-furred ""guest"". Look for lots of broad comic shenanigans with Faye Dunaway as the rich-bitch hotel owner, and Rupert Everett as the cane-wielding, buck-toothed Lord Rutledge.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,Strictly for the Kiddies,"This was the pits! They should have gotten rid of that dump ape, the kid, and Jason Alexander and simply had a drama about Faye Dunaway running a hotel. I saw it because she was in it, and she was hardly in it! Strictly for the kiddies!!!"
4,Cute movie.,My 5 yr. old Grandson found this movie to be very entertaining.I would recommend for this age group.
1,Can They Get anymore Stupid?,"I see there are some absolutely brilliant minded people in Hollywood. A Harvard graduate must of come up with the idea for this movie. What's next ""Dunston Builds an Atomic Bomb"", or ""Dunston Runs for President""?"
4,More Fun Than A Barrel of Monkies,"This movie somehow escaped me when it was released, but it is a knee-slapping, hilarious comedy for the whole family. I highly recommend it. Faye Dunaway is a Leona Helmsley type, Jason Alexander runs her five-star hotel with his two young sons in tow. Enter a jewel theif who uses a trained ape to case out rooms and steal. Add Peewee Herman as the ape hunter. And it works!"
3,Old movie brought back memories...,this movie was as funny as i remember it form my childhood with my sister...a little silly...but a real sweet movie to cuddle on the coach on a sick day and watch..great for kids too....wouldn't recommended for real young children.
5,Excellent Service,"The service was above excellent. I received my DVD within a few days and it was exactly as the seller described, new condition.I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.Thank you so very much....."
5,You'll Go Ape For This Movie,This family filled fun movie is great for kids and adults alike. this movie is really good. and fun for everyone. I Recommend it for everyone
4,Dunston Checks In,My grandchildren love this movie. There is one word that is said that I'm not pleased about being in it but it was subject for discussion about what is appropriate language. The laughter resounds through the house when we watch this movie.
2,Not that hot,"Man, I loved Black Uhuru and thought Michael Rose was better than Bob. Well, it seems he can't kick it without the rest of the Uhurus because this CD is weak. I tried to listen my way into it and I even brought it with on a month-long trip to Africa and kicked it in the car, but it didn't grow on me."
5,"Though nothing shows, someone knows...","Late in high school (around 1986 or so), I discovered progressive rock; one of the LPs I bought was ""Shine On Brightly,"" the original A&M release without the bonus tracks. I thought it was quite amazing, most especially ""In Held Twas In I."" My recommendation for a piece of music is whether it makes you think, and this piece did. I would buy that album again if A&M would reissue it on CD, sans bonus tracks. A prog-rock essential."
5,Bridges the gap,"This work bridges the gap between Procol's classic first album and their masterpiece 'A Salty Dog.' Evident is the humor and audaciousness of the former and the beauty and virtuosity of the latter. R&B meets classical in an often grandiose, sometimes disarming, but always engaging album."
4,"Great Music, Poor Mastering","why it is that mastering engineers feel they must ""improve"" on the work of the original engineers, artists and producers, I do not understand. This particular travesty takes a typical approach. They have greatly increased the low frequency content (pumped up the bass) thereby destroying the balances. One must strain to hear the details over the ""thunder bass"". This is an all too frequently used approach. It is particularly distressing on this, one of the greatest recordings of the sixties."
5,Held close by that which some despise...,"I love it when people criticize music by calling it ""pretentious"".This is a wonderful album, but the record company should have left off the ""bonus tracks"".With few exceptions, I generally don't like having ""bonus tracks"" added to classic albums. They spoil the climactic ending as in this case.And it's especially annoying when songs are repeated."
3,Save the bonus material for the box sets.,"Is it just me or do you get annoyed at the ""remastered"" classics with all the extra [stuff] on them. I buy these disks to rememberbeing 14 and rocking out to the vinyl editions at my parents house. Most of the extra stuff on these disks is boilerplate - you don't need it. Keep them in their original glory I say.It looks like all the PH newly remastered disks have this. It's too bad. I should dust off the vinyl and buy a new record player.5 stars for the original recording - 3 stars for the ""remastered"". What a classic!"
1,Gary on helium?,"The one star review is, unfortunately, absolutely correct!!! I thought I was going crazy or that my ears were shot. After researching it, I learned in fact that the speed was, in fact, too fast. So much for listening to or proofing their own product. One of my favorite Procol albums. I subsequently bought a Japanese import of it."
4,PH Shines,"A great price on a classic through the Amazon network. I had the vinyl version years ago, but had trouble finding this on other services such as itunes. For some reason this cd is missing, and I always considered this PH's best collection of tunes. I believe that it is their most creative and artistic cd and the vocals are crisp. A joy to kick back and listen to on a peaceful afternoon."
5,Rabid Harum!,"Procol Harum has some of the most rabid fans in America and across the pond and I am one of them. If you want to know where prog rock started then take a listen to this album and all of the other material they have put out (especially Grand Hotel and Salty Dog). Gary Brooker is the best singer to come out of England other than Eric Burdon and although Procol is not as bluesy as the Animals were, what they did with a symphonic sound is bar none! Put Emerson Lake and Palmer down and listen to Procol you will not forget it!"
1,Terrible!,"This collection of five tapes (two shows per tape) was packaged attractively- but the tapes were in terrible shape. Two of the tapes were not viewable; ""Noise"" and visual static interfered. The best of the five was ""washed out"" - no contrast, very white. I'm extremely disappointed- enough so that I have second thoughts about buying ANY used tapes ever again.I've asked the seller to respond- to acknowledge this problem, and consider an exchange or refund. I've had absolutely no response.This marks the second time that items purchased through AMAZON have had problems."
2,no the same,I have worn the Liberty Loafer for many years. These run wider than any others that I have -- in the same size. I will not order these again.
2,Disappointing quality,"I have worn the Enzo Liberty loafer as my primary shoe of choice for many years, and have owned at least 15 pair. I always knew I could depend on this shoe to fit my foot as if it were hand-made for me, and to be comfortable from day one. Unfortunately, the quality of this shoe seems to have deteriorated while the cost has steadily gone up. This pair is not the soft buttery leather I have grown accustomed to, but feels extremely stiff, does not conform to my foot, rubs my ankle and cuts into my instep. I will not be ordering these again, and am greatly disappointed."
3,Loafer was superb,"Fit nicely in toe area, however, I need a 4A heel. Was a tremendous buy, but next time (as I love this brand and shoe), I will look for a 4A width."
5,"I really love these shoes,",I am very pleased with these shoes. Only wish I could get them in white also. If available let me know
5,Great Shoes,I've been buying these shoes since 1991 and love them. The soft leather never gives you blisters and they always look great!
5,Love Enzo Angolini's Liberty flats,"I have been buying Enzo Angolini's Liberty flats since the late 80's/early 90's. These are my favorite flats to wear with just about anything!! Not only does the style go with so many outfits, it's exceptionally comfortable. I have many (MANY) shoes and these are the only ones I wear often enough to wear out. I'm so happy to find that Amazon is selling this shoe---making it much easier to purchase!!"
4,Satisfactory Experience,"The process for finding this shoe on the web site was easy and straight-forward. I received a confirming email from both Amazon and Shoe Mall. The shoes arrived within a week and are just as illustrated online. For me they are a tad snug, but I expect that to lessen as I wear them. I plan to order again from this vendor."
5,cute and comfortable shoes,"These shoes are fun and comfy. The can be used for either casual or dressy attire. I love Enzo's. They fit well, are made well and last forever. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a great pair of flats."
1,Not as expected,"Shoe appeared to be the wrong size.The shoe was a bigger size than what was stated , more like a factory reject."
3,Not as described,"They are rather tight for a medium width, and, although they are described as having a 1-1/2 inch heel, I measured the heel at 1/2"", the same as the Liberty Flat, which sells for $20 less. The low heel makes them less dressy than what I thought I was getting."
5,heartland whisperer,"These sticks were not only crafted by a master company of stick-crafters, but they were also designed by one, too! These sticks have great balance, they're not too light or heavy, hard or soft, and they're made specifically for vibraphone so they don't break the tone when you play at different dynamic levels like what happens with other sticks. Great buy!"
2,tips over every time,"While my 18 month has always enjoyed this toy, it is always on it's side in the water. Even when moving, it tips over every time."
1,Not fun,"We bought this for my son because he loves Sesame Street and thought it would be a fun moving toy. As the previous comment mentions, it hardly moves. It falls over and sinks easily. The most fun my son has with it is watching the propellor spin when it is outside of the water. When it is in the water, it moves so slowly that I don't even think he realizes it is moving at all."
5,"Truly, worth more than Gold","For those who already love Pat Metheny this is a must. For anyone else who is interested in music that is awesome, profound, challenging to listen to, and downright beautiful, then you won't regret it. But don't rely on a first impression. It will take more than one listen to appreciate this Gem."
5,An Incredibly memorable Metheny album,"The essence of Metheny and Mays is here in every piece....this album, Offramp and First Circle make the best jazz albums produced in the 1980's, and today they as poignant and rhythmic as they were then. Beautiful."
1,I'm going to pretend this didn't get airplay,"Out of all the songs on the new Black Eyed Peas album, I hated this one most. It has the worst rhythm, beat, and lyrics that I think they possibly could conjure. When I started hearing it on the radio I almost died. This is quite possibly the worst song ever created, it is sick, and does not belong on the hit station or on any station. The rest of the album is so good, so it is beyond me why they made this a hit. It is terrible in every aspect, and so is the video. IT scares me that anyone would actually like this song."
1,Musical Excrement,"This song is base, juvenile, and completely lacking of any taste or value. To say that this is musical excrement doesn't do it justice. If there were words more vile than what our language considers ""curse words,"" they might do.It is utterly worthless. The music is thin and synthetic. The words evoke no emotion nor thoughts with any semblence of depth or meaning. When the lyrics rhyme (not that that is necessary) they do so in the most childish manner (the ""bad/sad"" variety).This is faux-ghetto material. I suspect her humps/lumps are merely her 4th illegitate child and most recent outbreak of herpes.To think that this hit #3 on the charts and has received the airplay that it has makes me realize the dire condition of our culture. The next time you hear of ""sex slaves"" or the sex trade in some 3rd world county, remember that America's own children have been sold as ""pimps,"" ""hos,"" and ""porn stars"" towards the profit of evil ones."
2,yuck,"ok people, from a teens point of view, this CD totally sucks. 'My humps' is such a stupid song--i mean, it's about a girl bragging about how guys love her butt and boobs. it gives a horrible image of women!! the tune is pretty catchy, but the actual song is just so laughably stupid. Peas, go back to doing nice songs--like Where Is the Love, that song is rocks and has a great inner meaning!!"
1,Horrible,I respect Will I am as a Producer even though the Fergie Era has been about doing anything to sound accessible&if you go back to the way the BEP was before then this version truly is well below.this song stanks period.Fergie sounds like a Broke Lisa Lisa.One of the Worst songs that I heard all of last year.
1,Enough to make you envy the deaf,"I normally avoid Clear Channel radio like the plague, but every so often I am subjected to it. The last time I was, I heard this, and it reminded me why so much modern ""music"" is to be avoided by anyone over the age of 10 with a functioning brain. Vapid, annoying, idiotic crap. The music is unimaginative, the beats, as per usual for hip hop, are simplistic and uninventive, and the lyrics sound like they were written by a mentally challenged 12 year old. As the title says, crap like this makes me envy the deaf. If you were to hear this and the equally idiotic ""Hollback Girl"" by Gwen Stefani back to back, it would be enough to cause you to jab an icepick into your brain to make the memory go away. Utter garbage."
1,RIDICULOUS,"Flimsy, throwaway and ultimately utterly forgetable. This ""song"" just reeks of novelty. It's like the bastard love child of MC Hammer and Milli Vanilli, and actually no better than either of them. If I am to believe all the hype surrounding this group they are the hottest thing going. It quite frankly makes me glad I'm not a teenager anymore."
4,Fun song--overplayed though,"This song is DEFINITELY catchy without a doubt. You will either like it when u hear it or grow to like it. But yet, it's WAY overplayed."
5,My Humps----My Pumps up the VOLUME!,"My Humps is the coolest song EVER!!! My bf & I start singing when I'm at his house to this song. I thank my boyfriend for letting me listen to this song on his C.D.BLACK EYED PEAS, YOU (...)!!!!!!the food does to! HAHAHAHAHAHA! I love u, Black Eyed Peas!"
1,ANNOYING,"Whats wrong with people these days? My humps is probably the worst peice of s*** i've ever herd. When I bought Monkey Buisness I was hoping for something like Elephunk, at least that s*** was good. All my humps is talking about is a slut trying have sex. It's annoying! I cant stand this song anymore! Almost all the people at my school are singing this or playing it on itunes when the teachers gone. This song is way to overplayed and now sounds almost retarded. If you want a good song from them get Dont Phunk with my heart or lets get it started. And, if you want real rap get Method Man or Xzibit, thats real gangster s***! Later"
1,Bring on the negative votes! (1 Freakin' Star),"BEP's latest single, ""My Humps"", is an ode to the female body. The beat is...Actually, forget it. All I'm going to say is - this is the most ridiculous and gimmicky song I've ever heard, in my entire life. Fergie has absolutely no business rapping. Point-blank, period. Somebody please bring back the real Black Eyed Peas."
4,touching coming-of age tale,"this is a nice little coming out story; the characters are well drawn and the narrative moves well. there's a small twist at the end - not unpredictable - but the story is more a character study than an event-led novel. the ultimate message is that we each have to make our own decisions on the people we choose to surround ourselves with, rather than taking the opinions of others on face-value; it's a good lesson and the book is well written and enjoyable to read."
2,Unfortunate,"This unfortunate effort by Shannon L. Yarbrough fails to rise above adolescent obsession with sexual identity.The protagonist, Matthew, is uninteresting and unconvincing. One hopes -- and hopes again -- that this character might come alive. He does not.The book is not helped by the piling on of southern clichés. No matter how hard the author tries to evoke place with these trite references, there is no covering over the shallowness of the characters and their failure to engage the reader.(I decided to give the book a generous two stars, because I suspect that it is an early effort from this writer. Perhaps future efforts will yield something more substantial.)"
3,Good For The Price,This is a college book…how exciting can it be. It is serving its purpose just like any other college book. I don’t have any problems with it.
3,Underwhelming,"While this book was initially entertaining and relatively engaging, I felt that it drifted further from any sort of objective examination of ethics as it went on. While I did not agree with Socrates in The Apology, I could understand and respect his preceived duty to obey the law, but as he began to philosophize about the soul and its properties it seemed that he was building his elaborate castle on shifting ground. His love of analogies eventually leads him away from reality. He seems unable to understand that analogies are not always appropriate and that sometimes they can be flawed. Yes, much of what Socrates said forms the basis for many important institutions, but for the average person with an interest in philosophy, I thought this was tedious and often rather irrelevant."
4,A decent anthology.,"This is the kind of text used in those bread & butter Western civ. or survey philosophy courses. The translation is fine, but not particularly critical, literal, interpretive, or anything you can associate with a particular goal on translating. It's just the text. Maybe we could call it ""pragmatic.""The notes are very nicely done, comfortably introducing the reader to a lot of important background concerning ancient Greek philosophy and the culture(s) which spawned it. I think this is a fine book for becoming acquainted with Plato and generating interest for further study.What really to say about the content that other reviewers haven't already mentioned? The four books take us from outside the courthouse all the way through a post mortem wrap-up between the interlocutors. Justice, integrity, immortality of the soul, the afterlife... All of philosophy is just footnotes to this guy, after all."
5,Anytown USA - fabulous!,"The movie is a must see. Documentary film maker Kristian Fraga is one to watch out for, and you can see his genius at work here. 5 stars all the way."
5,A wonderfully sublime political documetntary.,"Anytown U.S.A. follows the 2004 mayoral election of Bogota, New Jersey. The film centers around the races' 3 candidates; the hapless Demcocratic challenger, the caustic Republican incumbent, and the everyman third party candidate. Director Kristian Fraga has created a comical, subversive work of political commentary. This movie deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. Highly recommended."
4,Structured Products,"After 10 years, ""Structured Products"" is still one of the best transitions from building blocks to structured products. Written with a practitioner mindset, it is a useful read for junior structurers, treasury sales, risk managers, and users of structured products. The book handles well the balance between risk management and valuation in tackling such a topic. Another big plus is that discusses at length and with relevant details, several common structures belonging to the equity and fixed income structures."
1,Oversimplified,"This book has been oversimplified, which makes it dull and boring. It is nothing like the original. It is very repitious and does not allow for the children to really understand the moral of the story.Nice try...but this is not a winner."
3,Born Blue,"Born Blue by Han Nolan is about a girl with a herion addict mother. Janie or Leshaya has been through many foster homes, physical abuse, unwanted pregnancy and death. The only thing that makes Leshaya feel good is signing. Leshaya is a survivor of her painful past.I liked this book because it tells people what some foster children go through. The book also tells me how hard it is to live in foster homes, and how hard it is to be physically abused. This book teaches me that if you have a goal and you want to achive it do what ever it takes no matter how bad your life has been. to survive you must be a survivor.-Tyeisha"
5,Leshaya moves into your heart & mind,Leshaya will climb inside your head and bounce around for weeks after you've finished Born Blue. It's a tragic story of girl who didn't get what she needed - and deserved - and your heart will ache for her at every turn of the page.Leshaya is one of the most memorable young American narrators since Huck Finn.
3,Born Blue,"Leshaya isn't your average teenage girl; well I wouldn't be either if I had a childhood like hers. All her life, Leshaya lived in a stupid foster home where the parents didn't even care about her. The only thing she ever enjoyed was listening to the ladies with Harmon, her foster brother. When Leshaya grew up, she wanted to be just like them, a singer. She'll do anything to become one. All her life she has made really bad decisions, stealing from the James', running away, and having a baby at age 13. Will she ever make a right decision and become a singer? Will she find a nice place for her to live forever? These questions and many more are answered throughout the book.This was okay; it was a bit depressing. It did, however, keep me wanting to read, wondering what crazy thing that Leshaya was going to do next. Sometimes I would just be like, ""Did she really just do that?"" I would recommend this book to anyone who likes bittersweet books."
3,Alright book,"This was an extremely dramatic book. It dealt with some pretty delicate situations.Leshaya lives with her mother for a short time. Her mother is a heroine addict. Leshaya goes to a first foster home; her new mother is a nervous control freak and her new father is quiet and gone all the time, but Leshaya likes him. Then her mother shows up: her new Father is a drug dealer and sold her mother heroine. Leshaya goes to many foster homes and goes through alot. She ends up at the same place she started, right at the side of her mother.I liked the book, don't get me wrong, but there were alot of things that got to me about the book:1) Leshaya is any thing but a hero: she lets herself go at any time: drugs, sex, any thing.2) Leshaya is stupid. She does stupid things to people who care about her and ruins all the relationships in her life.3) The end of the book was extremely disappointing.A good book, but defidentily not one of my favorites.~Atalanta"
3,A Page Turner,"Leshaya is a young girl with a very troubled past. Her birth mother is a heroin addict and her foster parents neglect her. Early on her only comfort comes from listening to tapes of ""the ladies,"" such singers as Etta James and Billie Holiday. She soon discovers she has a gift for singing as well. From then on all that makes sense to Leshaya is singing. She does whatever it takes to realize her dream.Unfortunately, all the years of neglect and abuse have an effect on Leshaya as she bounces around from person to person, ruining every relationship she has.This book is a definite page turner, I'll give it that. However, just like all the characters in the book that Leshaya encounters, I found her very hard to like. Even knowing of her rough life it is hard to see past her selfish and cruel ways.The book ends the best way possible, in my opinion. Leshaya faced with a very difficult situation finally makes a good, correct decision."
5,Even better than Dancing On The Edge,"I thought no way any of Han Nolan's books could be better than her book ""Dancing on the Edge"" but I guess I was wrong. ""Born Blue"" was one of the best books I've ever read. I particularly like the way it was told in blackspeak. It made me feel as if I could hear Leshaya talking. I'm glad she made the decision in the end to leave Etta alone. Who knows, maybe she'll come back to Harmon someday."
3,Born Blue,"This book starts out with a girl who lives in a foster home. Patsy and Pete are the people who run the house.Her and one of her friends love music. Janie loves The Ladies she and her friend Harmon could listen to them for hours. But her mom comes back into her life and Janie starts to see her again. Janie goers jthrough a lot good and bad. Drugs, singing, her mom, guys, wondering her her father is. Janie trys to do the right things but its hard for her, because she wants to have fun. Janie dosnt litsten so people get mad at her a lot. Janie has many people that try to help her but they all fail. Will Janie ever become a famous singer or will she fail? Will she regreat all the dicisions she has mad or will she be happy with them?"
4,Twisted parental love...,"""Born Blue"" is an interesting book with a message about twisted parental love, sort of. It's hard to explain but you'll know what I mean once you've read it through to the end. Janie or Leshaya, as she named herself after being ""kidnapped"" from her foster home by her mother and traded for heroin, wants to sing. That's all she wants to do, and she does. She runs away and travels/lives with members of various bands, does drugs and gets pregnant. She leaves her baby with an old friend, fully intending to go back and get it, and love it like her mother never loved her but -- I can't tell you everything. It is written in first person and Leshaya speaks very casually, in lots of slang, like she's really just sitting in front of you talking and it makes the book more interesting but it also gets a bit annoying at times. However, I thought ""Born Blue"" was a good book, not the very best, but still a good book."
3,Okay but choatic,"This is a typical ""Dummies"" book. Easy to read and understand but it's not written in any organized way. They do acknowledge this at the beginning of the book but it doesn't help if your someone, like me, who has never done this before and would like an algorithmic approach. In the end, it still sounded too complicated and we ended up buying a home."
4,Good not Great,I have many Dummy books and this is better than most but not great. So a nice place to start
1,Buildin your own Home for DUMMIES,"This book has no valuable information unless you consider that the answer to your question is ""talk to you contractor"" as an answer. If YOUR! building your own home this book is a good fire stater for a cold night after work and thats about it. There is nothing about the steps of building a home from start to finish. !!!!!!Again not for someone who actually plans on doing the work theirself!!!!!"
2,Mis-titled,"This book should be titled: ""Financing Your Own Home for Dummies""as it has very little info about building or construction techniques.If you need to know about construction loans, working with banks, dealing with architects and contractors; this is the book for you.It is not for the do-it-your-self home builder."
3,Lots of information on financing,"This book is pretty basic (it is for Dummies, after all). There is a lot of information on financing and working with your lender, which will be useful to some folks building a home."
4,Exhaustive,"This book has exhaustive information about building a home employing a general constructor and sub-contractors. It's more useful as a reference. I say that because of the way it's organized. It's not a sequential read, and has no logical beginning or ending. I bought this book hoping to understand each step that goes into building a home. However, this book is NOT about that. It's more about effectively dealing with things that come along in each step."
1,"Should be titled ""Financing"" your own home for Dummies.",If you intend to be an Owner-Builder don't waste your time here. This is mainly about financing a project with the rest about using a General Contractor. You'd be better off saving your money to buy coffee for one of your crews than buying this book.
3,Not the best telling of this story,"We all know the Stone Soup story, and its moral.This one is a bit heavy-handed. The villagers are stingy for no other reason than simply because they are pathologically afraid of sharing, and once won over with the soup they quickly pile on more food to make a feast.Too simplistically told, in my view. Get another edition."
4,Just Look'N Learn German Picture Dictionary,"Just Look'N Learn is an informative and fun German picture dictionary. This children's non-fiction is inviting and accurate with over 1,500 basic words. While perfect for boys and girls, it is a great resource for all ages. It is organized in alphabetical order using an appropriate English vocabulary, and amusing colorful cartoon illustrations which enhance each word. Each entry also has a simple, clear sentence in German and English demonstrating how the word is used. Other sections include learning to count, tell time, and teach days, months, shapes, and directions. At the end is a useful German-English word index. The book is also perfect for youth because its' highly visual design allows children to either jump around the book or just read straight through. A great way to get a first look at the German language"
4,Useful and stimulating learning tool for beginners.,"Simple and colorful illustrations with easy-to-understand, complete sentences for use by any age beginner. Appendices include numbers, days of the week, months of the year, shapes, directions, time, irregular English (but not German) verbs, nouns, and adjectives. German equivalents of the irregular forms would be useful. German index is quick guide for building vocabulary."
1,Not worth it,"A very poor representation of Sonny's work - when he was into his Pop and R&B phase (which he didn't do very well) He has so many other album's that are much more worth owning: Saxophone Colossus, Newk's Time, SR plus three, SR plus Four, Way Out West, A Night at the Village Vanguard, even Without A Song is better than this album. And, of course, arguably his best album of all time: Tenor Madness!!"
1,Don't be discouraged,"Written as a part of an informational series for people considering vocations to life in a religious order, this is some of the worst of Basil Pennington's writing. He was vocations director at St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts and is a well known writer, so he was an obvious choice to write the book on behalf of the order. However, there is too much factual information woodenly presented and without photographic or other illustration to be engaging. In fact I would think this would discourage vocations. Some basic early documents of the Cistercians are included but can be found elsewhere, including on line at the Scourmont Abbey web site. The volume is also considerably overpriced for the purpose. A better choice to learn a bit about Trappist life is the same author's book _The Monastic Way_ which is engagingly written and amply illustrated."
5,Yankee Magazine,Haven't received magazine yet but I have subscribed before and Amazon's rate is a great rate... Only word of caution is it will advise you that it is auto-renewing... You can opt out of that..
2,Get subscription from publisher (not 3rd party),"My 2-star rating is for purchasing the subscription through Amazon, not for the magazine itself. I bought it as a present, and they shipped it to me instead of the proper recipient. I contacted the third-party vendor selling the subscription through Amazon, and they said they fixed it, but they didn't. Finally, I contacted the publisher directly, and they took care of the problem right away. My friend likes the magazine very much, but if you want to subscribe, I recommend doing so directly through the Yankee magazine website, and not from here."
3,A lot thinner than expected,I expected this sleeve to provide cushion and protection. The only thing this sleeve will protect it from are scratches.
4,Solid 4 Stars,The addition of the Bonus tracks from Robert Fripp's Exposure makes this album a solid 4 stars. IMHO this album is the best work Daryl has ever done solo or otherwise surpassing even Abandoned Luncheonette and Voices.
4,Sacred??? Damn good anyways,"Sacred Songs came out at a eprfect time for me, another Fripp-o-phile. It made PERFECT intersection with Exposure, which (if no one else has mentioned it I certainly will) was just reissued in a double cd set... Exposure V.1 [original] and V.2 [2007 remix +] The '+' of course are additional mixes Darryl did not sing in the original (""Mary"" and ""Chichago"")It was nice to see this re-packaged and reissued as well."
4,Finally got around to this one...,"Like most of the folks who've posted reviews on this, I'm thrilled with the CD. The story behind its making nearly eclipses the music itself, which is unfortunate, because it is an excellent piece of work as-is, though the 'Frippery' gets a little heavy at times. Yes, there WERE a couple of potential singles here. If the RCA execs had bothered to listen to the whole thing they might have noticed that before shelving it for nearly three years. Anyway, here you have some of Daryl Hall's best demonstrations of vocal range, and some great elements of his songwriting coming long before the juggernaught that 'Hall & Oates' would become in the early 80's. Without Fripp's involvement and encouragement with this project, 'Hall & Oates' might not have taken that next step."
3,Sacred Songs are not easily sung....,"I always kind of dug Hall & Oates for the same reason I dug ""Miss You"" by the Stones: Great, GREAT dancing music for when ""last call"" has been sounded, and you want to dance right OUT some of the beer you've been consuming for the previous 3-4 hours. And I was floored - ASTOUNDED - when Tom, the ""record manager"" of an Atlanta department store, played the ""Sacred Songs"" single. WOW: Great rock and roll! And the guitar solo was/is superb, too. BUT....um...Robert Fripp? That King Crimson guy? Well, OK, ""Sacred Songs"" ain't available as a CD-single thing, and I've yet to see it on any compilation/""best of"" CD, so I bought the CD. And, yeah, the title track is, as I said, superb. But the rest of the CD? Well, the guitarist himself coined the very best adjective: ""Frippery."""
4,"Good example of the ""rock"" side of rock 'n soul.","I remember a friend of mine's mom had this record. She wasn't a big fan and told me I could have it...no cover, just a record. It was quite scratched but not so mch to keep me from enjoying it right away. This album is great because it keeps the soulfulness that is Hall and Oates but shows a different side to Daryl Hall's writing. My favorite song is ""Why was it so easy"". I love the lyrics as well as the creative chord progression. I'd recommend this to Hall and Oates fans who, particulary, enjoyed the War Babies album or the more rocking tunes. I'd also recommend it to those who wish Hall and Oates were a little more cutting edge."
4,one star for 30 years,"As a huge Fripp fan I purchased this album upon its release. At that time (1980) Hall & Oates grated on my ears - yet if Fripp was involved in this Hall album I felt that I should purchase it - and I did. Upon its release I would have rated it 2 or 2+ stars. But now that it has been released on CD with the bonus tracks; YBMULAC and North Star that I would give it an extra 1/2 star. However, for those of you who have purchased the 2 CD set of Exposure with the extra bonus tracks with Hall on vocals, let me say that you may add another star to this disc because you will see Fripp's vision much better.So I now rate this CD as 4 stars because it has improved with time."
4,Good Coffee Maker,For the money it is a good value. The only real issue I have had with it is that it si a bit messy. When the coffee is finished brewing you ave to put something down to catch the post brew dripping. Also when you first start using the frothing wand there is water in the line that must be purged so you have to have something to catch the water. These may be things I do better with after some more practice.
5,Good buy for the price,"This Delonghi espresso maker is as described by other buyer reviews. It produces a nice froth. Is moderately hot when made but cools quickly. Filters need to be cleaned periodically or flow can become blocked, but this is not a fault with the machine. Great deal for the money ($93). Have had it for just over a year. No problems yet."
4,Very Fun,"I am enjoying this de'Longhi espresso maker because it is easy to use, takes just a few minutes (worth the wait) and it is fun. I am using the Starbucks espresso pods because it is a quick clean up. Just wish it had little suction cup feet because it moves when positioning handle. Otherwise it is ""good to go"" as an addition to my kitchen.Starbucks Espresso Pods (12 count)"
1,Arrived defective,"We unpacked this machine and started to use it by filling the water tank, only for the water to swiftly leak all over our counter. There didn't seem to be any trick for replacing the water filter in any different way so we called customer support. They assessed that the machine is defective (supposedly a rare case) and that they will send us a new machine - in 7-15 business days. The customer service rep was friendly, but having to wait 7-15 business days is a bummer."
2,nice beginner machine for 3 months,Worked fine for three months. First the steam nozzle got clogged. Took off to clean and the plastic crew got worn down. So no longer makes steamed milk. Then the water tank cracked after I it fell from 2 feet. Seriously? YES. It nearly shattered. Take good care and be extra careful with this delicate device.
1,De'Longhi Espresso Maker Purchased through Amazon,I bought this De'Longhi Espresso Maker to replace one which had begun to leak. This one lasted less than a year before leaking puddles underneath. It now does not work at all. I am very disappointed in this product.
2,Good for 6 months ONLY,Used 3-4 times a week for 6 months until this morning when electrical smoke started to pour out of the steamer knob when I switched it on. Worked well during its brief life but it should have lasted longer. If you are swayed by the good reviews you need to think of this as a disposable product that may be economical depending on your coffee drinking habits.
2,No Water/Espresso comes out,"I followed the instructions and let the machine heat up for about 30 minutes then tried to ""clean"" it by running water with no grounds. Nothing comes out. I used pins to try and clear any blockage, but still no water/espresso comes out. The steam wand seems to work okay. It gave the milk a steam-room-like taste, but that was probably my fault for letting it steam too long. In the end, I returned the machine."
5,Great home use,compact yet has all the bells and whistles. Heats up very quickly and can be stored in cabinet saving counter space
3,Good for one year and then pump pressure falls low,"I got this machine and the De'Longhi EC155, one for the office and one for at home. Both were working great for one year, and then the pump lost the ability to generate sufficient pressure, so that now the coffee drips quite slowly, rather than flows from the dispenser. Lime residue (calcium carbonate) is not an issue, as we live in an area with soft water, and as I descaled the machines regularly. I also use the same ground coffee in these machines as when I bought them, so a coffee that is ground too fine is not an issue either. If you want something that lasts, don't buy these."
1,"broke after 10 months, still waiting for repair","We received this espresso maker for Christmas 2010. We used it approximately twice a week for the next ten months or so, and cleaned it according to the directions. But after ten months, it stopped working, Espresso would not come out. I called Delonghi, and they instructed me to send it to an appliance store in Ohio for repair. While I was happy that they agreed to cover the cost of repair, I did have to pay the shipping fee to send the machine to Ohio.Now, our machine has been in for repair through the whole winter, for over four months. I called the appliance shop and they said they are still waiting on Delonghi to send the part they need to repair the machine.If I could do it again, I would spend more money to get a machine that wouldn't break and be out of commission for over four months (and still going)."
3,Home barista,"I like the espresso process here. It takes some skill. The espresso itself is tasty. Its foamiing action leaves something to be desired though. Even closely following the directions, the milk stays watery...ok as steamed milk; lame for lattes. Lastly, it is handsome on the counter, but inconveniently bulky if you intend to put it away after each use."
2,meh,"i'll end up keeping it. just frustrated, really. my $20 mocha makes a better cup of espresso, no question there. the foam is pretty good but you've got to dispense the first couple seconds or you'll shoot hot nasty water into your cup. kind of a pain to operate this thing. i really miss my melitta from about 5 years ago, it finally died and they don't make 'em like that anymore. i've tried a couple of these and settled on this. there must be something better out there. i'm using illy coffee too, so i'm not putting folgers in and expecting miracles. i use my mocha when i want a really good cup...also the size seems small- i know i'm american so i expect XL everything, but i do have two of these in the mornings...."
1,don't waist your money,"It worked fine for about 30 cups of coffee and then the pressure droped to 0. Since it was under warranty, I took it to an authorized repair shop, about 3 months ago and I am still waiting to to get it back. Apparantly, service dept. can't get the parts to repair it. With this kind of lousy customer service, De'Longhi has lost me as a customer for their other products as well."
1,Very Disappointed - very weak espresso,"I was really excited to get a new espresso machine as my old one was dying on me. From the get go it has been trouble. The filter has two sizes and both are too small. I usually pull 4 shots on my old machine and get nice strong espresso, but this machine does not seem capable of pulling one strong shot, much less 4. Just putting the filter into the machine is a chore. Had to use incredible force to get the filter into place in the machine! Ridiculous. The steamer spits out a ton of water further weakening the coffee. It is terrible. I do not recommend this. Had a Dilongi in the past and it was terrible too! Should have known better."
5,awesome,Only had it for about a month but use it every day & it works great. I've been using with the coffee pods for less mess.
4,LOVE IT!,"Well, we've had this for about a month now, and it gets daily use. So far we love it, EXCEPT I really am not getting a good froth. Other than that, it's easy to use and makes wonderful coffee. My husband would agree with another reviewer in that he says it's not strong enough. This is the most expensive coffee machine that I've ever purchased, and am very happy with it and would recommend it. Loved the Illy pods it came with and will have to get some more! It makes a really quick cup of espresso! NO MESS!! This is nice as I am unable to function in the morning without it!"
4,convenient but weak,"Easy to use and convenient, this espresso maker can produce a drink with a crema like golden cumulostratus clouds glimmering in the sunset. The only fault I've found is that the espresso doesn't seem that STRONG. I use a dark roasted bean, which I grind each morning to a fine espresso ground, yet still the results aren't as potent as I would like. This is probably better for my stomach lining and ability to type coherently at work, but otherwise, not as much fun. Overall good coffeemaker."
4,Great espresso (when the pump pumps),"I initially failed to see all the negative reviews due to the ""self-priming"" pump running but not pumping. And, lo and behold, my machine came just the same way: Water heating fine, steamer working, pump running - with no hot water coming out.I have in the past dealt with other socalled ""self-priming"" pumps who still needed some help to get going. There is no way per se to prime this pump but leaning the machine a bit in different directions and shaking it got the water to the pump and it has worked ever since - and I make sure the reservoir never runs dry.The missing star is due to the few hours of fretting over this and the fact that the manual doesn't mention that one reason nothing comes out could be because the pump is not priming itself - and that this might be easy to fix.But since it started working it has been making a consistently damn good cup of coffee."
3,need help,expresso does not come out like in espresso bars. comes out frothy??? does anyone have any ideas on how to fdo
2,Not happy with this machine,The lid to water reserve comes apart when opened. The frothing arm is not high enough and it's hard to get frothing pitcher from under without spilling. I even have to use a shorter coffee cup than usual because of lack of height for it. I should have returned this expresso maker but didn't so I will live with it until it breaks.. Wouldn't buy another like it. Hope this helps others.
4,great buy for the price!,"My husband and I purchased this espresso machine after our cheap Mr. Coffee one stopped working. We've had this one for several months now and love it! It creates consistent, tasty espresso that we use in lattes and mochas daily. We've also used the steamer function to make many hot chocolates for ourselves and friends this winter. Overall, the only thing I don't like about it is the tray. It collects liquid and then spills all over the counter. It should be emptied after each use to prevent this. The steam wand could also have been better designed.Overall, this espresso machine works well and is a decent price and I would recommend it to serious espresso lovers and casual drinkers alike!"
4,Espresso machine,"After a few practice runs, I was making great lattes and Cappuccinos in no time. Make sure you let the machine pre heat fully before making the first espresso. The milk foamer works great. The downside is you can only fit smaller sized coffee cups in there. Also, you need an additional metal container and thermometer for steaming the milk. I bought a set on clearance from Starbucks for $20."
3,Good price-So so cappuccino,It makes good espresso but does not have the hot water capacity to make 2 cups at once. There is not enough power to make a good cappuccino foam.
5,A Satisfied Lover,"Ok, so I was searching amazon for the best review'd espresso machine and this is one I found had the least issues people had reported and most love it.So I'm here to add to the awesome! I just got it a few days ago and have already enjoyed it sooo much. The foamer took a little practice, but it works great. I was worried that I wasn't getting the right grind for the machine because the coffee came out kind of white/tan[and i bought a fresh espresso bean that day], even after the 5 initial washes with just water, but it is cleared up. It's kind of messy at times but very much worth it. Oh, and it's looks sexy on my counter-top. ;) Space-saver too!I love it! Hot chocolate is easily made with this as well.Enjoy~"
1,Bad experience,"I bought this espresso machine in August of 2010. It is October of 2011 and the machine is broken. The espresso comes in ice cold. I guess there is something wrong with the heater, but I cannot fix it myself and the warranty expired two months ago. I am very disappointed and will never buy De'Longhu again."
2,Defective - Twice!!,"I've purchased two of these machines from Amazon. The first worked for about 24 days without problem. Great espresso, easy use, quick set up, quality machine. I was very pleased. Then the steam stopped working. It just wouldn't turn on. I could make espresso without a problem, but no steam wand.Amazon is awesome. They scheduled a UPS pick up at my home and within 2 days, I had a replacement.Today, I am returning the replacement unit. Again, the steamer went out.It's unfortunate because it is a quality unit that I liked, but how good can it be if both of mine broke in less than 30 days?Off to find a replacement!!"
4,Great espresso machine for the money,This is a very nice espresso machine. The espresso tastes very good. All the important parts are made out of metal and the machine is easy to clean. I noticed only one small disadvantage during milk foaming. The machine literally runs out of steam quickly and it has to re-heat for a while. It is also very important to use skim milk for making cappuccino. I used 2% milk in the beginning and I did not get any foam. All in all a nice little machine. It definitely does the trick.
3,DE Longhi BAR 32 Espresso Maker,The product is good looking and easy to set up. I like the fact that you can fill the water canister and use it for many cups of coffee. The only negative is the fact that you can't make much espresso at once. The 2 cup espresso device which comes with the product doesn't really hold enough for two cups. So you have to be very careful not to run too much water through or you will come out with a very weak espresso.
3,Good intro machine,"I've recently purchased this machine for my dorm. It's definitely a step above any of the drip coffee makers or steam driven machines. The machine came with a tin of 18 ESE pods from ILLY and the resultant espresso is on par with nationwide chain espressos.There are two things I didnt like about the machine. One is the clearance from the drip tray to the filter holder is too small for some mugs but that isnt a problem if you use espresso cups or shot glasses. The other is the steam wand. The steam wand is too shallow to dunk into most milk pitchers and I'm not sure if this is unique to my machine but the steam pressure drops too soon before the milk reaches the recommended temperature. I'll try a number of things before I write off the steam wand completely. If I get the steam wand to work properly then the machine deserves a 4 for convenience, quality in light of the price, and quality of espresso made."
1,Product failed after only 8 months,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband last year. Well here I am searching for a new machine for this Christmas because the De'Longhi Bar32 failed after only a few months. The gasket cracked, the machine lost pressure and was then completely unuseable. What did I expect for only $100, I guess, but still, less than a year of casual use is unacceptable."
1,not working,"I just received the product, I followed all the instructions, never got a drop of coffee. Looks like something is not connected."
3,Makes crema very well with properly grinded coffee. But the milk frother leaks all the time.,"It makes very thick crema with properly grinded coffee.The coffee powder should be about half the size of regular Folgers' coffee powder or even finer.But the milk frother leaks all the time. Therefore, it messes up counter top.Also the frother wand wouldn't stay to the side of the machine. It always wants to move towards the center."
3,"Good Espresso, not so good frother","I purchased this product because I needed a new espresso maker and this seemed well reviewed for the price. It works great for making espresso, but the frother is one of the poorest I have ever used. I have used a variety of non fat milk brands and it seems that sometimes it works a bit and other times it just heats the milk. Since I am a mocha cappuccino lover, I have been very disappointed in this product for that reason. The previous machines of different brands that I have owned all worked much better than this. The design is not convenient for cleaning the frother either. I finally had to purchase a separate frother which makes this an expensive all around purchase to get my hot drink the way I like them."
5,PROVEN COMPANION,"Today I received my second Retro 15 machine. It's my second because I wore out my first (wasn't heating as well as it had), which I had for three years! I make a minimum of two lattes every morning: one for me and one for my husband. Each morning I know I can rely on a fantastic espresso and a froth that is done to perfection. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and this machine continues to deliver. It is easy to operate, takes up little counter space, and heats up quickly. I make sure to de-calcify the maker every other month to ensure it's cleanliness and longevity.The only complaints I would make you aware of are the sometimes leaky water reservoir (I have no problem cleaning this up when it occurs) and the loud sound during the espresso-making.If you're looking for a machine that delivers a latte as great as my mom's $700 machine, this one is for you! Overall, this machine is WELL WORTH the unbelievable current low price. I got a steal!"
3,Not as great as other reviewers said it was,"After reading many positive reviews on this machine and with the price being so affordable I decided to purchase the DeLonghi as a Christmas gift. My daughter is pleased with the machine and will use it until they can afford a better one. I guess in the espresso maker world, you get what you pay for. I have a Espresso Gaggia and it is a far better machine..but costs much more as well. I would suggest that you save up your money to purchase a better machine."
3,NO LATTE,"Unfortunately, I bought the machine for Latte's and did not realize it is very weak for that application. The steam is very low pressure ( barely at all) and does not foam the milk. The espresso function seemed to work well except the larger cup that holds the grinds is too small. I liked that it produced the espresso very quickly and you make mulitple batches by just adding more water, no wait time. Afraid its going back having only been used once."
2,GOOD COFFEE BUT----,"THE COFFEE IS GOOD BUT IT IS A VERY SLOW MACHINE, I MEAN IT TAKES AT LEAST 5 MINUTES TO BREW 1 C. OF EXPRESSO."
5,Love this espresso maker,Great price and a powerful little machine makes a wonderful espresso. I would highly recommend this machine. I like using actual ground espresso and not the pods.
1,Don't buy this item!,"We purchased this espresso machine on June 15. Three weeks later it started leaking and six weeks later it has stopped working! No pressure whatsoever is being generated, which means there is no steam for the cappuccino and no espresso -period. I will see about returning it tomorrow. Given that all we make is 4 espressos per day it should have lasted a couple of years. I am very disappointed"
5,Absolutely the best espresso maker I've owned!,"I've been using the espresso maker now since it arrived and has far surpassed my Aroma that it replaced. They both were about the same in price, but this one is at least 3 times better in quality and consistency of the espresso. Thanks."
2,Disappointing,"Initially I loved this product. I have had electric espresso machines for years so it was exciting to find a reasonably priced pump machine and it made great cappuccinos. Sadly, within 9 months I found it was heating a little less, then gradually the gasket started giving out and it would leak water. At a year and a half the heating element failed. Replacement would cost more than the purchase price. After this experience I certainly wouldn't buy another so I am going back to a Krups 4-cup electric espresso maker. Over the years I have had 4 of them and each one was good for 4-5 years dependable service at half the price."
1,Stopped working after a month and a half,"I got this Espresso maker because I wanted a pressure pump based espresso machine. I read the reviews and saw a lot of unhappy customers but most of them were complaining about the reliability of the machine, not the coffee the machine produces. So I ignored the bad reviews thinking that those reviewers just got unlucky and got a bad machine, thinking to myself 'surly it won't happen to me'. Sure enough it happened to me also. After a month and a half my machine stopped working. Don't buy DeLonghi. Their customer service it the worst and their warranty department is virtually non existent. Edan Aharony"
5,Very good buy!,"I've had this machine for about a year now and have not once regretted buying it. It is a little loud, but not unbearably so. I don't use pods so I don't know about how they fit but the filter size for gound coffee is just right for 1 cup of espresso which is really 2 shots. This is my first espresso machine so I don't have a lot to compare it to. All I know is that it is easy to use and makes a good shot of espresso. The frother works well, just make sure to get a fairly shallow frothing cup as it is kind of short. I use this machine at least once a day and it has lasted well. I've enjoyed learning how to make different coffee drinks with this and have come to enjoy straight espresso as well. If you're a beginner this is a good everyday machine that will enable you to become adept at making a variety of drinks. Buy the machine, do some research and have fun!"
5,very good machine,"wife loves convenience of using pods and is satisfied with the quality. methinks convenience is fine in a rush, especially since the pods we got cost 23 cents each, but it doesn't beat the flavor of high quality finely ground organic espresso beans, which is what I use with the machine. Easy to use and clean."
1,Water tank leaked!,"I received this as a gift from my daughter. I spent an entire afternoon trying to get the water to stay in the tank....no luck. It kept leaking out all over the kitchen floor. It would not hold water. When I received it and opened the box and took out the espresso maker, I noticed that the water tank was wet. I am just assuming they sent me a unit that had been used and returned by someone else. Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed. I am returning it on Monday.De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker"
2,Lost pump pressure after 5 months of light usage,"Bought it last Black Friday. Used it lightly the last 5 months and now the pump pressure is very low. And I did clean it regularly. Now, I'm only using it for steaming my milk."
5,DeLonghi machines are great,"I love this machine. In fact, I needed a second machine for my office so I bought a second one exactly the same. It's a great price and it makes a good coffee. After reading some of the other reviews I do have to admit that maybe the foamed milk isn't really piping hot."
5,Love it,"Just simply love it.had it for a year now,makes amazing espresso every time and very simple to operate and use. The cover on the water tank had cracked in shipping and the company replaced it right away. Great customer service."
4,My first Espresso machine:,"This was my first attempt at making espresso with an espresso machine. After following initial startup instructions, I made my first 5oz espresso. I thought that the ""crema"" floating at the top was a myth but was anxious to see it work. I had always thought it was just frothed up milk. I was wrong. When using the espresso grind and tamping down the correct amount in the filter at about 30 lbs pressure, I get a thick layer of ""crema"" to 3/8th "" thick which lasts until the liquid is gone.Get a real metal tamper because I don't know how you could exert 30 lbs of pressure with that plastic tamper attached to the machine.I also have a French Press that is OK, but boiling the water and brewing takes 7 to 8 minutes. From cold, this Delonghi takes less than 3 minutes to produce my first 5oz cup. So far I am very pleased with this purchase."
3,Not sure about this machine,"We just got this machine. I am very excited about this cute machine but I am disappointed with my coffee drink.First, it makes my coffee watery. I thought I used too much water so I tried the second cup.. same thing. I expect thicker coffee taste. Second, the steam wand is short and didn't froth milk. We will practice few more times.If it still doesn't work we will return the machine and get more expensive one."
5,Great!,"Simple to use, no fancy interface , it is not complicated functions and that's good enough for me,the taste good, I am very satisfied!"
1,painful making espresso,"I had to call Essentialespresso 3 times to get a rma#, when they did not answer my email request for a return #. I now face a 15-20% re-stocking fee. The machine made weak espresso, took to long to heat up (and then the water still didn't seem very hot), was hard to clean. I'm going to continue my quest for a good machine some where esle the Essential."
1,The price is outrageous from this seller Click.Buy.Get.,"This review is ONLY about the price from this seller Click.Buy.Get. and not the machine.The MSRP for this espresso maker is $149.99 on De'Longhi website. You can purchase this at Macy's or Amazon.com store for $99.99.Not sure how this Click.Buy.Get seller is in business. Since they sell it in a case of 2, you will think it would be cheaper by the unit but instead is over $260 each (over $530 for case of 2)."
2,Disappointed...,"I was excited after several years of using my beginner Krups machine to replace it with a more powerful espresso maker. Unfortunately, I am disappointed because I have yet to get a decent froth and the espresso is inconsistent."
4,Good espresso maker for the $,"I paid $99 for this machine almost a year ago. So far it has worked perfectly and makes a professional tasting espresso or latte. The pump works much better than a steam driven espresso maker ( because it does not scald the grains), and it steams the milk fine too. Some have complained about water leaks in the back, but I have not had this problem, maybe because I do not remove the water reservoir to refill, but rather pour water into it with a pitcher.recommend."
1,Leaks. Leaks everywhere!,"This machine started leaking and just got progressively worse. Ten months later, it's like a sieve. Called DeLonghi, they said I have to pay to ship it to the small appliance shop to have it fixed. I hate this machine and I'm not sure I want to go through the trouble and money to ship it back. If I were you and reading this review, I would avoid the name DiLonghi all together. Go with a different manufacture, one that doesn't build dud espresso machines."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE,"Unless you have money to buy another one of these machines in six months, buy something else. My machine made great cappuccino and espresso for five months, then began to make espresso that was bitter and to take forever to do it. Then it stopped producing espresso altogether. It just dribbles and makes a humming noise and you can smell the coffee burning.Now after two weeks of wrangling with DeLonghi ""customer service"" I've had to send the machine off for repair AT MY OWN EXPENSE. I spent 34 minutes total on hold with DeLonghi today only to be told that this is their policy.Buy a Gaggia Baby or a LaVazza machine. You'll spend more up-front, but at least you won't be buying yourself a second machine when it breaks in less than a year.I'm disgusted. I should have read the other one-star reviews here on Amazon more carefully.PURCHASE AT YOUR OWN RISK."
1,Disappointed gift giver,"I purchased this for a friend as a gift and it quit working after only 5 months. Customer service has not been helpful at all (wants him to pay costs of return, etc. when you could just provide a UPS pick up tag). I would expect the product to last longer than 5 months and if it didn't that it would be replaced with no issue. Your brand will not be considered for further purchses after this experience."
1,Loud and Inaccurate,"This machine is incredibly loud when its on and the water container rattles like no ones business. You have to hold on to the whole machine so its somewhat quiet. Overall, it makes decent espresso, but the size of the pods are completely incorrect and it comes out very foamy. The 2 shot pod barely makes one shot. I end up having to run it twice which is frustrating.I'd suggest getting a different, more expensive machine."
1,bad choice,"This machine does not make good stong coffee like I am used to from other de Longhi products. Why ??? ..........I have no idea, but I would not have bought this machine if I would have known before about the poor performance."
1,It is not a new one,"When I open the package, i found out that is was used.There was some coffee bean still left in the cup.i am expect a new one not a use one.I need some explan form the amazon."
4,So Far So Good!!!,This is the first time I purchase this brand. The coffee machine works very good so far. It makes a very good creamy milk for the cappucino. This product was purchased approximately 23 days ago and in this little time the machine works very good.
2,Beware - DeLonghi does not support its products,"As a long-time home espresso brewer, I was delighted to receive the EC140B as a holiday 2004 gift. It was a nice upgrade from my existing machine.Well, it's been less than 2 months and I'm glad I didn't toss the old machine when I got the deLonghi because without it I'd have no morning brew. The rubber grommet that holds the screen snugly within the filter head has completely fallen apart rendering the EC140B unuseable for want of this little piece of rubber.I've visited deLonghi's website, but it's incomplete (doesn't appear to have been updated since it went online in March 2004) and the Customer Service phone number in the documentation that came with the machine is ""No longer in service."" I'm willing to accept a percentage of product failure, but deLonghi can't or won't stand behind their product quality. Beware."
3,Easy to use,"I bought this machine so I could stop spending so much money buying lattes every morning. It's pretty easy to use once you figure it out but takes some practice to pack the grounds. The steam wand seems a little short and I needed to get a stout pitcher for frothing. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Love the BAR32,"The DeLonghi BAR32 is excellent! It's easy to use and does an outstanding job producing creama and foamed milk. For the price, it would be very difficult to beat. I highly recommend it."
1,Yet another DOA,"This showed a lot of promise--seems well designed and solidly constructed. I can see it being very useful in the absence of one limitation: the unit I received did not make espresso. The pump simply refused to work. The milk steamer part was fine. I looked at some other 1-star reviews after this experience and found several similar reports--including some where the replacement unit was also DOA. To avoid such an event, I simply bought the equivalent Mr Coffee model at a local store. It's not as sleek, but it works--great espresso and foam the very first time. A side note: Amazon has put distribution of a similar DeLonghi machine on hold because of reported quality problems. Wonder if that's related?"
3,"Good frother, weak espresso","Although it takes quite some time for it to build up enough heat/steam to accomplish anything, it does froth well once it gets going. Runs out of steam quickly though and I have to let it build back up to finish frothing milk. I was disappointed in how long it took to make a simple 2 shot latte. I bought it for work and had to take it home because no one had the time to make themselves a latte. (15-20 mins)I like the convenience of pods, but was disappointed again to find the pods would only produce one shot per pod. It would cost about the same to go to a coffee house and buy a latte from them."
4,Good machine for the money,"This is our second DeLonghi capaccino maker. Works great, only thing to keep from 5 stars is time it takes to make the espresso. Makes the milk very quickly. Seems to heat up quicker in steaming mode than capaccino mode. First DeLonghi was not this model and leaked after some use. This time I am letting the pressure off as soon as I'm done making the milk. Also, instructions recommend you take off the frothing nozzle and clean after each use."
1,You get what you pay for,"De'Longhi never sent the advertised mail in rebate, and the machine broke after 1 year of use. For as long as it worked the coffee was fine, but I can't recommend this machine. If you want a cheap espresso maker you will be better off with a stovetop model."
1,"more work, less good joe","After warming the water to start, trying to find the exact right grind of coffee, tamping it to just the right degree, and getting less then average expresso, I gave up and am trying to send it back to Essential Expresso. So far they won't give a return authorization. I will look elsewhere for a better machine and service."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product has fallen very far short of my least expectations. The rubber grommets that keep this in place are not securely attached and constantly fall off. There is catch basin between the water container and the pump, which is theoretically a great idea in case you overfill it. However, in the case of this poorly-made product, every time you fill up the water container, most of the water leaks out into the catch basin and out all over your counter. The motor is exceptionally loud. I would not recommend this product even to my worst enemy. I'm willing to bet that a cheap $30 expresso maker from Target or Wal-Mart would beat this hands-down in overall quality."
1,VERY weak espresso,"I have been drinking espresso for a long time and I have had a number of espresso makers. This one make very weak espresso! I have tried experimenting with the grind, with the time for heating, with the amount of the water - in short, I really tried to make a decent espresso with this machine, and I cannot do it. Maybe it is possible, as some of the reviewers say, but at this point, it is far more trouble than I am willing to put in (I already put in more trouble that I wanted to). I recommend that buy some other espresso maker with a larger reservoir for grounds, with a better heating device... something. Don't buy this one."
5,Incredible Machine,I purchased this coffee maker for my wife on our Anniversary. She loves the Great Coffees of the world as she was stationed all over Europe for 8 years in the Navy during the Viet Nam Era. This coffee maker really impressed her with the ease of use and cleaning. The Cappuccino this machine makes is fantastic accourding to my wife some the best she ever tried. It is a nice luxury item to have at a cheap price.
3,Used sent as new?,My daughter got this unit for Christmas as a gift. When she got the device she was wondering why there was water already in the unit. The coffee pods were also missing in the shipment. The espresso maker did work however. Makes you wonder if Amazon is selling used items as new?
5,I like this expresso maker,This is cheaper than other esspresso machine. But I like this machine.The taste is good and isn't difficult to make esspresso.
4,espression,"enjoying the machine and not running out to coffee house each morning. espresso tasty, but weak."
2,Don't waste your money!,"These bibs are a big waste of money!They are too difficult to get around my son's neck, and he HATES it when i put them on him!Then, once it's finally on, he is constantly getting his arms stuck under it and getting frustrated that he can't get his hands to his mouth.Also, the pocket part of the bib is always getting smooshed by the highchair tray so that no food can get into it, so it all ends up on his lap - what's the point of a pocket bib then?They are easily cleanable and wipeable and don't have to hang dry forever... those are the only positive things I have to say about them.I recommend trying the Bumkins bibs instead, we love them!Grade: D"
3,The light's getting dim,"Stan Levey and Frank Rosolino are particularly fine here, but the whole enterprise is beginning to sound a bit safe and formulaic. If you are interested in exploring what the All-Stars were all about, start with Volume Three, which still reflects the original concept of the All-Stars as a creative crucible, an arranger's workshop with shifting personnel, and not merely a pleasant house band."
3,Wonderful Book,"Overall this is a wonderful book. It is obviously this is a long term study done by William W. Tuttle, Jr. I found that his main goal in this book was to write an understandable book that documents the events that occured in Chicago in the year of 1919. In his book, it is apparent that he covered every aspect and perspective of the events that took place. This may be due to the fact that he not only focuses on the events that took place in chicago. but also on other similar events that took place around the nation. My only compliant might be that because of this the theme of the book at times seem recurrent and repeative. That aside, I would suggest this book to anyone interested in the history of Chicago."
4,best (and only) book on the 1919 Chicago riots,"As far as I know, this is the only book on the subject, which is an absolutely fascinating one for me. It is well written and very coherent, but unfortunately the author spends most of the book of the causes and results of the riots, not on the riot itself. Still, this is a wonderful book, essential for anybody interested in Chicago history."
5,Communication is the key,This book raised my consciousness about the two way communication between dog and owner. It doesn't give many step by step directions about training but that can be found in reference books at the end of the book. Perhaps understanding the relatiionship with our pets is a bigger step before attempting specific training. I found myself much more sensitive to my dog after reading this.
4,"A Hope diamond, buried in a heap of gold","You will find, buried in the middle of this classic rock collection, an extremely moving ballad entitled ""Come Away Melinda"".This was written in the shadow of the Iron Curtain, the cold war and massive nuclear proliferation; it captures with a haunting nostalgia, the very real, and almost palatable fear of eminent devastation that hung over the youth and the artists of the flower-power generation.Like Alice Cooper's ""Only Women Bleed"", Heep's well-deserved reputation for hard rocking, and heavy-bass driven music has always meant that when they do a soft, emotional piece, like ""Come Away Melinda"", it gets lost in riffs and the rage of heavy metal.If you are a rocker, the alblum will get your heart pumping and feet moving.But within the chaos, you will find a moment of peace, tranquilty and reflection that is worth the price of both the CD and the LP."
2,Nothing New Here,"This album is ok - not spectacular. Basically, Uriah Heep is a clone of a lot of other bands from the era, with little new to add to the mix. The music is heavy and fuzzy with rather simplistic lyrics. If you go into this cd expecting great stuff, you're going to be disappointed. If you come to this cd knowing that this band is basically the model for Spinal Tap, you won't be disappointed."
5,TRACK LIST,"Sa-Fire / Sa-FireTrack Title1. Boy, I've Been Told2. Love Is On Her Mind3. Thinking Of You4. I Wanna Make You Mine5. It's A Crime6. You Said You Loved Me7. Gonna Make It8. Better Be The Only One9. Together10. Love At First Site11. Let Me Be The One (12"" Version)"
5,Protect your lens one way or another,"Sure, this filter will protect the front element of your lens. But it may not be your best option. You can buy a 52mm adapter tube that screws onto the threads on the front of the camera. It positions 52mm accessories (like your old Nikon skylight filters) at a minimum distance in front of the lens. You can even add a lens hood... I use the hood that came with a 35mm f/2.0 Nikkor lens. It doesn't vignette because it's so much larger than the lens. Talk about protection... now you've encased the entire lens, not just the front element!"
5,"Sonny Goes to Work on ""Work Time""","Sonny Rollins and company don't waste any time going to work on the classic ""Work Time."" The all-star band of Ray Bryant, George Morrow and the incomparable Max Roach punch-in quickly with the blazing ""There's No Business Like Show Business."" The telepathic interplay between Sonny and Roach is a trademark of this album, and it's particularly evident on the album's next two tracks, ""Paradox"" and ""Raincheck."" A lovely ballad, ""There Are Such Things,"" is the fourth track, and the band clocks-out at 5 much the way they began with the break-neck swing pace of ""It's All Right With Me."" If only I could have this much fun at work."
1,A Horrible Addition to a Dreadful Series,"The factual inaccuracies contained in this book and in the others in the series are inexcusable. In addition, the anthropomorphic, sensationalistic style with which the authors portray supposedly ""dangerous"" animals assigns the natural world a false and malicious attitude that simply does not exist. I would reccomend never buying this book or any by these authors, since their factual integrity is clearly quite low. If it were possible to give it zero stars, I would."
5,Seductive sixties sizzle!,"The sophisticated sound of Brasil '66 is instantly recognizable on every track. The title track out sold the Beatles version and together with Scarborough Fair went Top 20!The soaring vocal harmonies of Lani Hall and Karen Philipp, coupled with the sexy, sultry arrangements (which are a trade mark of Sergio Mendes) make for spine tingling easy listening.Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas is a fan and his teaming with Sergio Mendes on the recent Timeless will hopefully bring Brasil '66/'77/'86/'88 etc to a new generation."
3,Not worth more than 6.99,"I bought this toy at the toys r us store for 6.99 regular price. I wouldn't pay more than that. It's a cute bath toy and have had no problems with it, just would never pay that much."
1,This is not a genuine Galt Toy,"I purchase this sorting wheel for my grandson, because my own children loved the toy. On first use the toy fell apart. While it resembled the original toy, some of the shapes were too small for the post boxes and could fall out if shaken. The retaining bar was an undersized dowel and did not secure the shapes inside the wheel. I contacted Galt UK and was told that they no longer dealt with Original Toy Company and that the sorting wheel was discontinued by them in 2009. Amazon did give me a full refund but the toy is still being advertised."
3,"If you have the lab manual, you don't need the atlas!",I highly recommend that you don't spend the extra money on the photographic atlas if you have purchased the lab manual (Laboratory Theory and Applications) by the same authors. There is nothing special about it and it has all the same pictures that are in the lab manual.....If you don't plan on getting the lab manual then it is very interesting and I recommend it.
1,Useless,"I bought this as a first year medical student in hopes that it would simplify and better illustrate the complicated world of microbiology. In the end, it was a totally useless book. The pictures are average but really low yeild. If you are a med student trying to find pictures, I strongly reccomend you look elsewhere. If you are an undergrad and have tons of time on your hands, get it and waste a nice weekend or two. Otherwise stick to the assigned books. If you are a proffesor who has chosen this as an assigned book, shame on you!!!"
2,Don't BUY,"This book is useless, it doesn't even come bound, it's just a bunch of sheets w/ holes in them so you can place this in a binder. The book isn't great because it is far from an atlas. It is more like a lab manual, explaining a little about the different lab tests. It basically has only one picture(in color)for different examples of each bacterium. Seeing as how it's an atlas, I assumed it to have lots of different pictures of each bacterium. Furthermore, it occupies alot of space with useless low yield info such as chemical structures. If you're buying this book for pictures of bacterium and virus, don't, because you can find comparable pictures on the internet. Also, not sure about this, but it doesn't seem that the authors are PhD's or MD's. They don't list a designation after their name, which may not matter to you, but I've found that most of the useful books are written by PhD's/MD's. SUmmary: Low Yield Book; Should not include atlas in the title because it is far from one.."
4,The book is an excellent resource for a microbiology student,A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory allows students to see results they might expect from an experiment. The atlas provides an good review of procedures and results that students may have already seen. The atlas helps beginning students have confidence that the results they are seeing have indeed been seen by others.
2,Good as far as it goes,"This was a required text for my micro class. It was sometimes a little helpful, but it mostly didn't have the answers to my questions. It covers too much in too few pages. The only time that I really found it to be helpful was in reading test results. When I wasn't sure if, for example, my VP broth had really changed color enough to be a positive result, the large glossy pictures were nice. However, when I was trying to figure out colonial morphology, only about half the terms that we were supposed to know were covered in the book. Not so helpful. So, as I stated earlier, this book is helpful when it covers the information that you need, but I was never sure if what I was looking for would be covered in the book."
3,handy,It was in good shape and with excellent colors but it was kind of unorganized and did not give me all the information that I needed. Overall 3 stars.
5,A Great Buy!,I bought this book for my Microbiology class next fall. It came very quickly and in great condition! Just what I needed!
3,Beware of what you purchase,"I'm sure everyone pays attention, but clearly I did not when I purchased this. For those students who have a scammer of a school/univesity who makes their own sealed book packs, this is only a third of what you need to get (maybe 1/4). At the time, the college I went to had 3 in their 'exclusive' pack, which includes the textbook, this atlas, and the lab book. These books I had to purchase separately online since they are WAY to expensive for me. I ended up purchasing all 3 at almost how much it woulda cost me to just walk in the scam college bookstore. Le sigh.Excellent atlas though. Great pics, informative, and helped me with my Micro class. Hope it helps you too!"
1,Okay,"I was told this book was in used good condition and when I recieved it the book was held to gether with zip ties!!! Decent book though, not nearly as informative as I would have hoped."
1,review,"the item I purchased wasn't complete, it was missing another lab book that was supposed to come with the atls. i have sent it back for my full refund."
5,Beautiful Music,"My daughter (age 8) loves this and could play instantly. It arrived a little out of tune, but that's to be expected. The sound is soft and lovely and far better than the grating squeaks of a recorder."
2,A wonderful gift at a great price!,"PLEASE NOTE - THERE WAS AN ERROR WITH THE AMAZON WEBSITE WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO CLICK ON THE STAR RATINGS. I HAD INTENDED TO GIVE THIS ITEM A FULL 5-STAR REVIEW BUT WAS UNABLE TO. READ ON! I bought this for my daughter last Christmas and have not had a single regret. I had hoped to get her interested in eventually learning to play a celtic harp and this seemed like a simple first step. I purchased extra music sheets to add to what it came with and, even at 5 years old, she has really gotten the hang of making pretty music with it. It is one of the few toys she doesn't forget about- it is out on a regular basis and is simple enough for her to use. I've had to tune it at least a couple of times but I would think that it is to be expected especially when less than gentle hands play with it often! It is a beautiful piece, well-crafted and simple. I can't think of a single reason to hesitate if you are considering this instrument."
1,Useless Instrument,This Melody Harp was actually returned to me from my grandchild because the pins would not hold the strings in tune for even one song. What a waste! Where is Quality Control when we need them?!!
3,tunes or toy?,Harp was purchased for a Christmas gift. We carefully tuned the harp and found it difficult to keep in tune. It is an item that any age can play with...
1,dress,I really was disappointment when I got this dress. It really made me look dowdy in it. I wear a size small and I felt fat it.
5,A must for the Ultra Stomp Rocket.....,"If you have an Ultra Stomp Rocket launcher, than you already know that it is inevitable that you'll need more of these. What a great toy."
1,Disgusted with Return Policy and Poor Customer Service,"Warning: DO NOT ORDER FROM FAT BRAIN TOYS! This product is a joke. It is advertised as appropriate for kids ages 5+ but on the packaging it states that not appropriate for kids under age 8. When I called to find out how to return it because this was purchased for a child who is 5 years old, I was told that my reason for returning it was not sufficient for the company to pay for it to be shipped back. In the words of the rude customer service lady, ""if everyone wanted to return an item they were not happy with, then they would be out of business."" Well, am I wrong to think this is a weird policy? Do I have to fabricate a reason for her to take the company to take their item back? It isn't appropriate for the kid I planned to give it to. I ordered it because it was falsely advertised in terms of age appropriateness. Now I am being penalized for being mislead. Unbelievable! Do not order from FAT BRAIN TOYS!!Ultra Stomp Rocket Refills"
2,X-mas gift,"I bought these as christmas gifts. So, kids haven't played yet. From the packaging I don't think they'll be very durable. Seems like they will come apart. I hope I'm wrong. I do think my 5, 8 and 10yr olds will like it while it lasts. But, will is last? is the question. I think it's a great idea."
4,Great toy,"Great toy, low cost fun. It isn't that durable, the plastic is rather brittle, so watch out. Flys true, goes really high. Just be careful not to step on it, often hard with little ones."
2,Rockets Need More Boost,"These rockets do not fly as high as the original Stomp Rockets or the Super High Performance Stomp Rockets and were a real disappointment. I think the large red bulb on the tip adds too much weight and prevents them from flying very far. This is coming from a 260lb man and kids will really be disappointed. Get the Super High Performance Stomp Rockets as even my 4 turning 5 son was able to send them 100-150 feet when angled. Ultra Stomp Rockets would be fine for a backyard as they will not go very far or high, but what is the fun of that. Go the original Stomp Rocket for your backyard as they fly higher."
3,Great!,I had purchased the Ultra Stomp Rocket present for my son. The rockets lasted through a few park plays with a bouch of rough boys. So I had to purchase more. Glad they are not to expensive. I have a feeling that I will have to replace them often.
2,Packaging ripped,The package was ripped open. I ended up just taking them out of the packaging and putting them in a box to wrap.
5,Great videos!!!,"We bought this for our 3 y/o... he loves trains. All 4 of the videos are very good and my son has enjoyed watching them over and over. A must have for anyone who loves trains. Interesting, entertaining and informative."
4,Good value overall,"The alphabet train is well done: tight editing, good dialog, excellent scenery, and it has a nice discussion format, with the narrator and a chorus of young children (all boys, unfortunately). They talk about the clips and learn early reading, counting, colors, in/out, over/under, and same/different concepts. For each letter in the alphabet they pick train-related words as examples. They really packed a lot of good info into the video. I haven't 'fielded tested' it on my nephew yet, but I think it will be a hit.Awesome Trains, by contrast, seems to only be there to make the other videos look better! It has poor editing/timing, a cheesy script, shaky handheld video, and about 3 decent clips they seem to use over and over, between the mediocre ones. It really looks like someone's home movies... (I think I'll use it to teach Matthew what happens when you put a CD in the microwave! :)I haven't seen the other two yet, but the alphabet train alone makes it a good deal."
4,The Nature of Insight,"This is a scholarly book edited and written by leading researchers in the area of human development. It includes contributions from several respected scholars on insight that are very thought provoking. It isn't a book that will deliver answers as much as promote more questions.My purpose for reading this book was to look at several different ways of explaining insight....what is it? How does it work? Where does it come from? Can it be taught or is it something we are born with? Is it tied to intelligence or is it an independent variable? This book helped me gain all of that and much more.The authors provide theories about insight that are well grounded in empirical research, including ties to organization development and social insight, where my interest lies. As an extra bonus, there were several pages of visual puzzles that can be used to test and promote the development of insight, that I will try using in my research."
2,not so great,"This sprayer came partially disassembled, and had no instructions. The spray pattern it produces is uneven and unreliable. It kind of spits at what you are spraying, and it leaks like crazy. As for the claim of not having to pump it, if you get everything just right it might spray for about 5 minutes off of the pressure it gets from filling it. After that it's back to pumping. Most of the time a fitting is loose or something else happens to let the pressure leak out before it does you any good. Save yourself the extra bucks and get a regular pump sprayer. Or spend the bucks you have to pay to get a professional electric powered sprayer. This one is not worth the extra money."
2,Authors feel that depression is a spiritual problem only,"I am Christian, and I also have been diagnosed with depression. When I received this book, I opened it expecting anecdotes and little things to do in my daily living to help me get through my depression. However, the book focuses entirely on Christianity. Phrases such as ""The person who is depressed should ask himself what he is doing to make himself depressed. He may discover that he is living a lifestyle that is clearly against God."" For those to which this statement applies, the book could be very helpful. The authors believe that depression is some sort of mindset that can be easily overcome, not a real disease that millions deal with daily. If you want tangible ways to overcome depression, beyond prayer and an active relationship with God, then look elsewhere."
4,living with depression isn't fun but it is a choice,I feel like depression is both physical and spritual problems. It is a sin to let depression control our lives. I have been diagnosed through the Minirth Clinic as a bipolar individual. I am on medication to help me. The idea behind Dr. Minirth's books are to make you realize that God will help us through our depression. Only through prayer will we have the strength to overcome depression. It will not make it go away but it will help us not to give into Satan's control over us through the depression. If you don't believe that Satan battles for our lives then maybe you shouldn't read this book. May God lead you.
2,Disappointed : (,"It was my first time ordering on Amazon and I purchased the movie, Wuthering Heights, through Movie Mars. I had friends and familly over to watch it and it wouldn't work. Come to find out it was a region 2 ( UK ) dvd not region 1 ( USA )even though I typed in that I lived in the States. Any way, I returned it hoping to get my new one and in the mail and instead they gave me a credit for the purchasre price of the movie only....Amazon rectified the S & H after I contacted them with my complaint. But, I won't be ordering from Movie Mars again : ( It's so disappointing ......"
5,Love beond border,"speachless for a verygood choosing of lights ,color,music & most of all choosing the charactors."
1,Doesn't play on my DVD player,"Very disappointed that the disc won't play on my new DVD player. Another reviewer said that the region code is the problem, since this is a European production. I have never had this problem before and am very disappointed that I wasted money on a DVD that will not play on American players. Perhaps techies can make adjustments on their players, but for the average person, this is a problem. Be forewarned!"
2,The Moors,"I just love to look at Juliette Binoche with her innocent and very expressive eyes.....Was darling in this movie and in certain scenes reminded me of Julie Roberts,especially the somewhat swollen upper lip.....The music is hauntingly beautiful..."
2,"Bad story, the movie was put together good.","I had heard a lot about Wuthering Heights, not really about the story but that either they loved it or hated it. I didn't have a clue what it was about when I rented it. The story is awful. I love romance books and movies but this is just terrible. The movie was put together well it is just the story line. I couldn't wait until it was over. I almost turned it off in the middle of it but kept going. The best part of the story is literally the last 3 minutes."
2,re wuthering heights remake,"just watched remake wuthering heights, i love the book ,film with lauwrence oliver, this was a real let down,cathy with a french accent no no ,ralph finnes wonderful performance carried the film cannot touch the original............."
2,Terrible movie!,This is decidedly among the worst movies I have ever seen! It is completely incoherent and shallow. In my opinion the actors don't even come close to rendering the emotions of Heathcliffe (one wonders if he even has any...) and Kathy. I give it two stars ONLY because of the beautiful scenery provided by the moors.
1,This movie is unjust to Emily Bront,"This movie adaptation is extremely unjust to what Emily Brontprotrayed in her novel. For one thing, the protagonist (Heathcliff) is portrayed as a person that one should have pity for. In the novel, Heathcliff is supposed to incite a negative and bitter reaction from the reader. He is supposed to be one of the more evil characters in the novel, and we're supposed to hate him from the beginning. Another bad point is that the movie only shows 1/2 of the plot of the book, when really, the second half is much more important and crucial.Admittedly, the movie is good in itself (which earned it that one star), but it's atrocious to see what is done to Bront and her hard work."
1,What?!,"This was a very horrible film. The plot was chopped up and scattered, the characters were not allowed to have any depth, and the claim that the film spans the entire book is only true in that it has basic plot points, but leaves almost everything of substance out in between. I was not even a huge fan of the novel, but after this film, I would gladly go back and suffer through Bronte's writing than watch this monstrosity. I am always amazed at how certain directors and screenwriters can get a hold of such wonderful actors (in this case, Finnes and Binoche) and turn them into nothing more than talking manaquins with no personality or depth. The entire time I was hoping that the two of them would just die already so the film would be over. How anyone could enjoy this lackluster production is totally beyond me."
1,Very disappointing,"I admire the actors in this film so much that I would like really to be able to say that this is a very good film. Unhappily, it is not. I admit that I have not read the book, but I want to. I hope that it is better than this film. Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche are very good actors and they were very young when they made this - but they are both not very good. They are ""trying too hard"", I think. Others actors in the film are better, but it is in the whole not a good film. The countryside is beautiful and filmed in Yorkshire, I think, and the nusic is lovely - but I think this is not a film to buy."
2,Not what you'd expect,"This was not what I expected from a movie, that was based on a book that I love. Ralph Fines is a perfect Heathclif. Juliete Binoche was a dissapointing Cathrine. With a french accent, she was not believable in this part."
3,"Fiennes is good, but overall film lacks the book's passion.","Though I enjoyed this film alright, I have a hard time imagining anyone who hasn't read the book being able to apreciate the story or characters very well. It tries to be a ""complete"" screen telling of the story, but it's really just the highlights. Ralph Fiennes is the only real saving grace. Heathcliff, the original gothic romantic anti-hero, forrunner to such characters as the Phantom of the Opera and the Vampire Lestat, seems like the role he was born to play."
2,Miscast,"This film is probably one of the few adaptations that is reasonably faithful to the text, but the casting is ridiculous so it was hard to take seriously. The actors are too old to play the parts - they are in their 40s yet they play Catherine and Heathcliff in their teens. It is silly to see the pair giggling and acting like children (because in the book they were) when they are obviously so much older! Juliette Binoche even plays young Catherine which adds to the ridiculousness of the role. I really wish the director had cast different actors. Wuthering Heights is one of those books though, where it is just so difficult to convey all the passion and grief into film. So read the book!"
3,Preferred another version,"As near as I can tell, there have been at least 11 versions of this made for the screen. I have seen four, so don't know what the other 7 may hold. In any event, I thought this version was a bit slow moving. I felt the more recent version with Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley was better, as it held my interest more. Neither is quite true to the book, but I feel that as long as the story is not radically changed from the book, it is not a problem. For those viewers and reviewers who have as their constant mantra ""isn't like the book"", I say: ""then read the book"". I actually expect film versions of books to be somewhat subject to the interpretations of the screenwriters and the director, and that gives me another perspective on them beyond my own. Back to the DVD at hand- 3 stars indicates ""just OK"" according to Amazon's guidelines, and that is what I would give this."
2,Made One Critics List as Best of 2012; however sound was almost inaudible on Amazon Instant Video,"The movie looked ok, but the sound was so faint on my MacBook Pro, that I had to use earphones in order to hear it. I am talking about the sound on Amazon instant video, not the sound on a DVD.The movie itself is impressive; Andrew O’Hehir’s of Salon.com picked it as the best movie of the year."
5,"Must see, if you love this story",I have watched many versions and think this is by far the best.The book isn't nearly as enjoyable as watching Ralph & Juliette.
1,Do not buy!!!,"I got ready to play this and the dvd is for european veiwing. My player would not play this! It has a #2 which is the zone it is formatted for. Never heard of this but my computer knew it could not be played and the dvd player said ""cannot""."
2,Adequate Adaption of Literary Classic,"I'm one of the rare people who have actually read ""Wuthering Heights"", and appreciate the filmmakers not straying far from the book as in other film adaptions. However, the film is rather tedious and gloomy and would be a 1-star if it weren't for Ralph Fiennes, who looks good and holds your interest even in the midst of a semi-dismal film such as this."
4,One of the better movies of this Victorian Gothic romance,"The acting and costuming are very good in this movie.The moor is well done in the desolation.The ghost of Cathy comes to Wuthering Heights to claim a soul after Heathcliff digs up her grave: thus, in this version it has a gothic slant. Emily Bronte's prose has a brooding feel that is captured well here."
4,Best version ever.,"Probably the most romantic/tragic movie I've ever watched. Leaves the Laurence Olivier et.al. version for dead. (That movie finished half way through the book). Ralph Fienne's tortured and damged Heathcliffe is mesmerising, but WHO cast Sinaid O'Connor for Christ's sake??? And Binoche as Cathy is of course ""haunting""-(sorry couldnt help it!!!) The eponymous scenery and the music score stay in your memory long after the film has ended. You'd be a hard heart not to enjoy this one"
5,A splendid tragic romance...,"Of all the movies I own from the 16th to 19th century eras, this is without question, my favorite. I love it so much I have seen it at least a dozen times and I'll watch it several dozen more times and never tire of it. The music is so hauntingly beautiful, and the scenery magnificent. Everyone I've loaned it to returns it to me saying ""I have a new favorite movie..."" I highly recommend purchasing this movie. It's worth every penny."
3,3.5 stars for a good redition of the entire novel.,"I love the 1939 Oliver film but it and all of the other versions of this film never go beyond the first half of the novel and then the very ending, and even then Olivier's version is far happier than the book and the TImothy Dalton version completly changes the entire novel!While this film couldn't possibly contain all of the novel it does a very good job of it and unlike a previous reviewer I did not find it choppy. The filmakers took the best elements of both generations of this tale and managed, for the first time, to do the entire novel some justice. I would still like to see someone do a minisieres of the entire book someday, it would be worth it."
2,Doesn't come close to an accurate portrayal of the novel...,but at least it restores E. Bronte's hopeful ending. Read the book instead.
2,Could be better,"As much as I like Juliette Binoche as an actress, I sincerely thought the role of Catherine Earnshaw did not suit her at all. It was not convincing - Catherine Earnshaw is a complicated profound and yet mislead person - she is here played as a smiling happy-go-lucky person, laughing incessantly, even when discussing such a serious matter as matrimony with Ellen Dean. She took it with a pinch of salt. I think Emily Bronte did not wish her to be quite so light hearted.However Ralph Fiennes plays Heathcliff beautifully - the role suited him very well, and so for Ellen Dean."
1,wont play because its from erurope,"I cannot even watch the DVD because it is european and nothing mentioned it not being able to play on american dvd players. I am not a tech genius so I dont know how to change the region code on the dvd player or xbox so I cannot play this dvd, Ive never heard of such a thing. I am unhappy because I wasted money on a movie that I love but cant watch because of the region code."
3,Good but could be better!,"I bought this video just two days ago and I find that it is more true to the story than one I have seen before. It was a bad idea to try and fit all the story into 90 mins. It's very jumpy, one minute your in one scene and then in a completely different one! I thought Ralph Fiennes was quite a good Heathcliff! The only thing I thought wrong with it was that there is no passion, it's just flat and Cathy and Heathcliff don't even really show any love for each other! On the whole though it is a good adaptation!"
3,"meh, it was ok.","keeping in mind that cathy was 18 when she died, it was totally wrong - the actors were too old for the parts.the writing was good and kept in line with the book. fiennes did an understated, malevolent heathcliff. costuming and location were good. overall i like the tom hardy version better."
1,"Oh God, not another one.","I am sorry that I am compelled to give this one star. The horrible, cringe-making adaptation (it cannot be called anything but ""butchery"") and awful sets combine to make this yet another in a long list of _Wuthering Heights_ failures. Will anyone ever do justice to Emily Bronte and her brilliant novel? May that day not long be delayed!"
3,Super Cheesy!,"After reading the book, I wanted to see if the movie captured the hate of the story and it really doesn't. This movie is super cheesy and corny."
2,Those Wigs!!!,"I have seen 2 other versions of Wuthering Heights and of course read the Emily Bronte books in H.S. This version is not good at all. Those wigs worn by Ralph Fiennes and others distracted me for they were so bad. I cannot watch Ralph Fiennes most of the time and here he is not believable. Give me Sir Lawrence Olivier anytime. Sir Lawrence, though he did not get along with Merle Oberon during the filming, showed so much passion in the B/W version and even Timothy Dalton was tolerable. Juliette Binoche was boring and silly and my darling Jeremy Northam was hardly visable."
2,Withering Heights,"Forget this version of Bronte's tale of obsessive love. Even the Olivier version is soft. Check out the hard to find version starring young Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff, possibly 1964 (?). The cinematography is a major player in the drama, as is the haunting soundtrack. I don't understand why the version I praise is not available, for it has truly the best of all elements and it successfully and comfortably balances the demands of the novel's complex plot and the cinematic arts at their most vivid and austere!"
3,"Great treats, but smell awful!","My dog Nova loves these treats, they are great for training. However, these and all the other ""everlasting"" products give me a very bad headache. They smell VERY strongly and I cannot get around it any way, even if we give them to her outside, she smells like if for hours. Perhaps it is just me, but if you are at all sensitive to smells, you might want to pass on these particular treats. I would reccomend ""Wellness"" treats, my dog loves them and they don't have that horrid smell, and are also better for your dog, ingredient wise."
5,Puppy Loves Them,"I got these puppy treats today and my puppy loved them,they are really small and soft that a young puppy can enjoy them too,they really smelled good too! But I do think the company needs to put more in the package!"
4,Treats,My dog loved them. They didn't last very long. Need more in a package. Expensive for what they are. They even smelled good enough to eat!
3,my dog is picky,"these are probably good treats for the average dog, but my husky is the ultimate in pickiness and won't eat them. they actually look good enough and tasty enough, he is just spoiled and likes people food so even though he doesn't eat them, they are probably good treats."
3,"Dogs like them, but they are too expensive!","My dogs love these, but they can go through a bag in one training session. I wish they had bigger bags or bulk purchase options."
1,Pro-training treats,I would give zero stars if I could. Simply for the fact that I never received these in my order!!! I was sent some bogus available berry pill that I never ordered. When returned I still never received a refund of replacement. Very unhappy
5,Amazing,I have long curly hair that tends to be dry and picky. This is a great hair day in a bottle everyday and I am only about 2 weeks into mine. Definitely buying more. Well worth the extra $$$
5,I love it!,"I have hair that's been dyed over and over and usually looks like a shag with extra frizz. I read the reviews of Frederic Fekkai but was intimidated by the price. I gave it a whirl and WOW. From the first few seconds of using the shampoo, to being actually able to run my fingers all the way through my hair with the conditioner, this product is amazing. I highly recommend it to those who are in constant search for shampoos and conditioners that make your hair look and feel salon fabulous. It truly works!"
5,Months of Good Hair Days in a Bottle,"My hair looks fuller, softer, and shinier when I use this conditioner. It also has waaaay more body. I used this conditioner, along with the Technician Shampoo, a few years ago after receiving it as a gift; I always got lots of compliments on my hair then. Because of the price, I bought something less expensive, but not cheap, when I finished the bottle. Instantly my hair looked less full and wasn't quite as manageable and I had my first bad hair day in a long while. After finishing that other brand (it starts and ends with an ""A"" and is famous for its natural ingredients) I broke down and bought bottles of the Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Technician Conditioner. Glorious! Good hair days were back again! Other people notice as well and I'm still getting those standard questions, ""did you get a haircut?"" or ""did you color your hair?"" ""Nope"" and ""not recently,"" I just switched back to the world's best shampoo and conditioner."
4,nice modern read with the civil war as a character-,"clever story with the cool guy, sexy lady and a boy from the civil war as a character. loved the read and without giving a long boring review- I will say it reminded me of a Hiaasan story"
3,Re-write Gettysburg History,"A very interesting, well developed story, about re-enactors and a great historical discovery in Gettysburg that will rewrite history.I enjoyed it; however, the historical errors detracted from the story for me. Anyone familiar with Gettysburg knows that Gettysburg College played a role in the famous battle, and is still there today as a college, not a university. I guess the author (Candian) could be forgiven, but I can not. It was a serious sloppy editing error. Other than that, the other errors can be forgiven. I enjoyed the book and would encourage people to read it. Next time, edit better: thus, only three (3) stars."
3,Battery,Doesn't hold a charge for very long... not like my old one did anyway. It works though so I'm happy with that.
5,One of the best books,I read Rebecca when I was in high school. Since then I read this book periodically. There are very few writers who can write a wonderfully sensuous love story. Ms. Dumaurier stands out in that category. Her books have the right blend of romance and mystery. It is indeed a pity that this book is out of print on Amazon.com. Reading Ms. Dumaurier's books is a special treat for me and I try to savour them since there will be no more of these books.
4,An old-fashioned page turner.,"As a middle-aged male, I am probably not the typical reader of ""Rebecca"". I raced through it in one weekend, careening through the many hair-pin turns that come one upon another in the last third of the book. The reviewers who complain of the slow pace of the first third should understand that the groundwork must be laid for the excitement to follow. I had to force myself to slow down so as to savor Ms. Du Maurier's enchanting descriptive writing style (being a gardener helps one appreciate the descriptions) . I must differ with all those who state that the main character remained un-named throughout the book. The main character was named... ""Manderley""."
4,Es ist einfach super!,"I first read it when I heard my friends discuss about it during lunch time. I read it for a few times for I am only a teenage school girl and my comment of English is not very good. Anyway, I am really glad that I have pick up the book. It is the only book that kept me so well in suspense and the ending is so well set that I can not help reading it again and again. I know there is a reason for Daphne not to reveal the narrator's name. But it really set me wonder whether Daphne had actually a name for her in mind. The reason why I had given only 4 stars is because though this is a magnificient book, but it still could not surpass my favorite book, "" Gone with the wind""."
4,A Good Read,"I think that Rebecca is a very good book. It was never boring to read it, it was always so exciting because I never knew what the end would be like. In school we have also seen the film of ""Rebecca"" and I found it not so good as the book, because in the film the persons have sometimes had other character traits. For example Mrs. de Winters was a bit stupid, meek and weak there. But the film was good to understand some scenes of the story. I thought a lot about this book and I want to give praises to the writer, Daphne du Maurier."
4,Thrilling,"Rebecca is a thrilling story. I've read it willingly. It's not a nice story. Mrs de Winter has a lot to bear but it makes her stronger. I find that this book shows the power of love. Because without this belief in love Mrs de Winter would not have hat the strength to fight for her husband. The end of the story is hard. I thought that it would be a ""Happy Ending"" but that's only half the truth."
4,Thrilling,"I found Rebecca was a very interesting book to read, it was very exciting and trilling. It was not very difficult to understand but it was also not too easy. I can recommend it to anyone who likes trilling stories."
4,Eerie book,"This book is one of the best I've read. The description is brilliant, the plot clever, and the voices of the characters realistic. The only thing is is that it isn't a book you can read over and over."
4,"Shy, qiet girl loves murderer","'Rebecca' is an intresting book, I read it very fast because I liked to know what Rebecca was like and why Maxim is so weird.The story about the storyteller's jealousy of a dead person and the murder is very thrilling, but, and that's the reason why I woulden't give five stars, I don't like the behaivour of the storyteller very much, I think she doesn't fight for her love, she never speaked with her husband, she gives up and thinks her marriage have failed, although her 'enemy' is dead."
5,Rebecca for the Adolescent Reader,"I first read this book in the eighth grade. I was really intrigued because it had a great story line. Now that I'm in college and am taking an adolescent literature class, I have decided to reread the novel in hopes of greater understanding. It is very fascinating. ""Rebecca"" by Daphne Du Maurier is a mystery about a young girl who dies and leaves her husband widowed. The husband remarries and Rebecca begins to haunt them. The underlying part of the story begins when Rebecca's late husband, Maxim de Winter, makes his second wife, a lady who's name the book never mentions live in Rebecca's shadow."
2,Disappointing,"... Though highly readable, I find the characters to be rather flat, and the plot a tad bit too predictable. It also has a tendency to drift, which gives me the impression that Dame Du Maurier had written this without really knowing where she was heading herself. On top of that, I find this novel to be far from atmospheric or brooding. Rather, the devices employed to create an eerie atmosphere eg Danny's skull-like head etc, seem to me to be rather contrived. Maybe I'm feeling this way because I have heard too much positive feedback prior to my reading, it's easy to be disappointed when the novel falls slightly short of my expectations. But one thing for sure is that this is not the best suspense thrillers I've read. I'll stick with Victoria Holt."
4,An eery delight!,This is a timeless classic. Very eery and yet touching at the same time. The heroine is easily someone you can identify with. I also enjoyed watching the movie after finishing the book.
5,Best book ever!,"Rebecca was one of the best books I've ever read. The feelings of the different characters are described perfectly in this book. The mysteries are breath-taking. Daphne du Maurier made the end perfect. It's a very sad ending, but the story is not finished yet there. Every reader can imagine the very end himself.About the story:After the death of his wife Rebecca, Mr. de Winter goes to Monte Carlo to forget his past. At that time he meets a young lady, marries her and takes her to his home Manderley. But there is one problem in this new marriage, Rebecca who died under mysterious circumstances. The memory of Rebecca ruins the marriage of the new Mrs. de Winter and Maxim de Winter."
3,A good story,"I found this book interesting. At the beginning, I thought it was very boring, becaus on the first few pages nothing interesting happens. After reading on, the real story begins, and then it is quite interesting. I think it is a very special story, because it is independent of time. This story could happen today, tomorrow or could have happened forty years ago.Everyone who loves a mixture between crime and love story should read this novel.The story is not very difficult to understand."
2,misleading ad content,"I ordered this book based on the picture that was shown for the paperback edition. That edition showed a handsome book, and I figured the hard bound edition would only be better. When I received the book, it was merely a hard paperback version of cheaper of the two paperback version. It was very old looking and with small print. I returned the book and got the nicer of the two paperback versions."
1,Not what I expected...,"I could write an entire review on my dislike for the main character, alone. This book is so popular, yet so boring. By the time any real suspense came along, I was 3/4 in. Again, the main character wore my nerves out!"
3,Boring Begining,"I had to read this book for an honors english class and I could hardly get past the first 100 pages. After the that, the plot picked up the pace and it became a halfway decent book. I would advise anyone who quits reading after one boring chapter not to even try this book."
5,Wow!,"Oh my gosh! My English teacher recommended this book to me, and when I first picked it up, I thought, no way am I reading this! Well I did read the book, and although the book took a little while to really take off, it became quite intriging. I love romance novels, but this one just blew them all away! Rebecca is about a young mistress (her name was never given) who is married to a widower name Maxim. Maxim's late wife, Rebecca, was loved and cherished by everyone~maids etc., and after her death a few things got a little cooky around the house. Everyone tried to make the new mistress feel unwelcome and out of place. I'm not going to give away the book, but Daphne Du Maurier definately through in a major suprise regarding Rebecca's death towards the end! I loved this book, and I wouldn't be suprised if I picked it up and read it again!"
5,One of the best,"I fell in love with this story when I accidentally caught the old movie version on tv one night. I bought the book and fell in love with the story all over again.Ms Du Maurier created some wonderfully vivid characters. The coldly distant Maxim, the lurking Mrs. Danvers, the timid Mrs. DeWinter (I LOVE that we never know her first name), and the ethereral Rebecca who starts off as a tragic figure and then....well read the book.The description of the house and the grounds and the boathouse were incredible. I felt like I was walking the same corridors as Mrs DeWinter. Felt her apprehension as she realized she could never live up to Rebecca and I will always get a chill when I think of Mrs. Danvers. She is right up there with Hannibal Lector in terms of creepiness, in my opinion.Rebecca is a great piece of literary fiction. So creepy, so chilling, so incredibly brilliant."
4,A Great Middle & End!,"""Rebecca"" is a very slow read in the beginning -- too much blabber about landscapes and flowers. But do plod through. If you can get through the first 80 pages you're in for a real treat. A timesless classic of love, jealousy, evil and murder. After you read it, see the movie starring Laurence Olivier."
2,not a very special book,"Rebecca was one of the worst book I've ever read. It was very boring and not very special for me. It may be good a book for readers who like romance and mysterious stories, but for those who like tension and action it's not the right one and not my taste. Sorry!!!"
3,"Well wrote, but moraless","Rebecca is an interesting story, and Daphne Du Maurier used nice writing techniques to tell the story. But I find it completely moraless. I will not explain why because I don't want to wreck the story for anyone. Also why doesn't Du Maurier name the narator of the story, even when Maxim talks about how pretty her name is. That just strikes me as odd and extremly annoying."
3,"Not sure why this is a ""classic"".",Entertaining and very easy read. Fail to understand why the book is called a classic as it was not amazing.
4,Classic Murder Mystery,"It was good but some parts were slow and sometimes the main characters shyness got annoying. Other then that, it was very good. I would recommend it if you are a fan of gothic romances like Jane Eyre."
2,Without tention,"I don't like the book Rebecca. At the beginning of the story it was just a list of everyday things. For example a walk or a meeting or something else. I found it boring.When the diver finds Rebecca's body there is a little moment of tention. But before you can study if it was suicide or if it was an accident or if it was murder, <the murderer is revealed>. ... Then all tention is gone. The only thing I have found interesting is the question why the murderer killed Rebecca... But the rest of the story was boring for me.Still the book was a good novel because it was easy to read. But if somebody wants to read an thriller, I wouldn't recommend Rebecca."
1,Cheap binding and paper.,"Very dissappointed! I wanted a nice edition as a gift and this arrived with cheap newsprint-type paper, narrow page margins and blurry ink. The binding was just as bad, feeling like thin cardboard. A story of this calibre belongs on a bookshelf with a good binding to withstand many readings. Returned to Amazon with no hassle whatsoever."
3,"flowery, but poignant","although i didn't care for the lavish description in this book, it read well and i would highly recommend it to anybody who can endure slight boredom until their attention is finally grasped."
5,My Favorite Book,"Rebecca captured me from the moment I open the cover. The detailed discription of every petal on the flowers, of every facial expression and what it relayed to the reader. The story swept me away with its interesting characters and twist and turns of the plot. As the book progressed I found myself not just relating to one character in the book but drawing from each a different aspect of life. When I read the last page of Rebecca I was yearning for more. Wanting to know what happened next. I literally read my copy to death. I had to resort to hard cover after going through so many paper backs they were falling apart. I have read a lot of great books in my years but none that stay with me as Rebecca does."
5,This is one of my favorite books (and movies!) Read it!,"Rebecca is a truly delightful classic that I can read over and over again. I have also watched the Alfred Hitchcock interpretation of the book, in his movie entitled Rebecca. You should see it! The movie captures all of the mystery, romance, and suspense of the book. Usually movies change the story drastically or just are not as good as the book. Hitchcock does the book justice! But anyway, READ THIS BOOK because it's truly engaging and beautifully written. You will not be able to put it down! One of my all time favorite novels."
2,Just OK,"This book was written in 1938 so it seems very long winded for today's standards. The suspense is there and it holds your attention but at the same time, I just wanted the author to get on with the story already."
5,Pick it Up!!! right now!,"I had heard so much about rebecca but never really considered reading it .Finally irritated by all that i heard ,i picked it up and couldnt put it down ( it's true.. my sister even yelled at me)This is a reallly awesome book as it stresses on characters really well.The name of the protagonist ( caroline) is given just once in the whole book( which is kind of exasperating) but adds to the period drama the best part is that the characters are entirely convincing.They are extremely well drawn especially those of Maxim deWinter , Frank and of course, Rebecca.Even Small characters such as Ben, Bee and Favell do great justice to the intense plot.Most of all, the transformation of the new Mrs.de Winter is truly reviving.This book will keep you in susppense because it will take turns when you least expect it to and leave you yearning for more. Dont miss it! i recommend Jane Eyre and Pride and prejudice too!"
4,Overlooked book,A wonderful book for many audiences - a mysterious tale that changes with you as you grow and re-read. Beautifully written
4,Was an all around good book!,I thought that Rebbecca was a little confusing in the beginning but the middle and the end were great! Once you got to the middle you knew what the beginning meant. I would reccomend this book to people who like a creepy sort of scary book. Once you got to the middle you could not put it down. I'm eager to read the conclusion Mrs. DeWinter!
5,Rebecca the suspense thriller,When I was younger I read this book. It kept me in suspense on every single page. I loved it so much.That is why I rated it a 5 star.
5,"Superbly dramatic narration, flawless production values.","Anna Massey's dramatic voice provides just the right degree of drama and tension for Rebecca, the psychological story of a young woman's confrontations with a remote employer, a hostile housekeeper, and the ghost of a past wife. The unabridged presentation allows for full appreciation of Du Maurier's works and subtlety: highly recommended."
4,LOVED IT!,"In reading a book, I know the author left an impact if I find myself missing the characters after turning the last page. Even though we were never told her name, the narrator is a character that lies inside many woman. She is a person they fear to be, the fear of losing ones personality in loving a man. Du Maurier clearly did a beautiful job in creating this character"
1,poor description,"This version of the audio-book is an abridged version of the book and this fact is not indicated in the listing. The listing is incomplete and without details therefore implying that it is unabridged - very disappointing. However, Amazon's Customer Service was excellent in remedying the problem - they gave a full refund even though the cd had been opened and offered to help find the unabridged version that we needed."
2,Utterly dreary.,"""Rebecca"" was not at all what I expected it to be and I was disappointed. I expected more of a mystery, more of a mind bending plot, not endless pages of nothing happening. The ""mystery"" did not surface until about 75 pages to the end. The ending deeply confused me and left the story hanging. Perhaps the ""sequels,"" which were released more than 50 years after ""Rebecca"" was published, will make things clearer. I do not recommend."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very dissapointed with this book. The characters were very hard to empathise with,the story was very slow and when there was suspence, you were let down. It seemed that the author didn't even know where she wanted to take the story next, then just settled because she became bored with her own story."
1,can you say B-O-R-I-N-G???,I HAD TO READ THIS FOR MY RESEARCH PAPER AND I CAN TELL YOU IT IS NOT GOING TO BE AN A+ PAPER BECAUSE HOW IN THE WORLD CAN YOU WRITE A PAPER IF YOU DON'T GET THE BOOK. IT GOES ON AND ON AND JUST GETS ME LOST.
1,Don't buy this book,This book puts women in the worst of light. The young woman is plan out shown as dumb and even backwards. Normally I like Gothic novels. If this had been the first one I had read I would have never read another. She is unable or unwilling to see anything on the bright side. Sorry I really have nothing good to say about the book.
1,IT was an assigned summer reading nightmare!!!!!,THE BOOK WAS NOT GOOD AT ALL BECAUSE IT WAS NOT INTERESTING AND I WAS FORCED TO READ IT FOR A SUMMER READING BOOK AS IF READING OVER THE SUMMER ISNT BAD ENOUGH I HAD TO READ REBECCA IT JUST A THOUSAND PAGES OF NONSENSE. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR AGAIN AND I'D ADVISE YOU NOT TO EITHER.
3,A lot to think about,"I enjoyed reading this book. There are a lot of emotions in it.Daphne du Maurier has written a good novel! Especially the relation between Maxim and his wife is psychologically very interesting.However I gave only three stars, because although the story is interesting and as I wrote already filled with emotions the end didn't satisfy me totally! Manderley burns down - very suddenly and quickly and then everything is over. That was definitely a fast ending. Too fast for me. There I expected more."
5,There is a reason this is a modern classic.,"While I am not typically a fan of the ""gothic"" novel, I have wanted to read this modern classic for years to see if it would live up to the hype. I was pleasantly surprized to find that ""Rebecca"" is indeed worthy of the praise it has received over the years. I won't re-hash the plot, (naive young woman marries widower, goes to live at his creepy estate where the memory of his former wife Rebecca is everywhere). Suffice to say this novel has great suspense, a superb sense of foreboding, and enough plot twists to keep you hooked. As other reviewers have stated, it was a particularly brilliant detail to keep our heroine unnamed, it allowed the lingering memory of Rebecca to pervade this novel just as she infiltrated each of it's characters. Rebecca does not disappoint, highly recommended."
5,"Timeless, Ageless, a true classic.","Absolutely brilliant....the author has combined a modern falir with the classic approach. It's not boring like most of the classics, but can be fairly considered a classic nevertheless. Excellent language descriptions, a haunting plot and great characterisation. One can easily relate to the new Mrs De Winter as she is portrayed so well. The only thing I didn't like was the ending...it could have been more resolved, and it was hard to figure out exactly what happened. I mean, it ends with Maxim and his wife gazing at some yellow-orange glare that rises where Manderley. What is one supposed to make of that? But other and that, a literary masterpiece."
3,Rebecca: the book,"The story is an engrossing one, with lots of nice detail. It is something to relax with but not in any sense enlifting. The drawback is that one can watch the film and get many of the points in the book, slightly changed to suit censors. The packaging led to losing 1 star. The pages are close to the binding and the text is close to the edge. I suppose this is the drawback of a cheap edition. On th whole, OK and no large complaints."
5,This is a Fabulous book,"This is probably the best book I've ever read. I love to go back to it and read parts of it again. The settings are wonderful, the main character was so easy to identify with, and you cannot put it down. When you're done, you wish there were more of it. I take this book with me when I go away, just because I know I'll never get bored if I have it, and because it's kind of about travelling in a way. This book will appeal to everyone, I think, and I would really recommend it."
5,Loved it,Rachel is defintely a book I will read again. I finished it in one day. The story wraps you in and somehow you can't let go. Very intriguing until the very end. When I finished I ran out to get the sequel Mrs. De Winter.
5,Fabulous!,"This book is such a treasure. My family has been wanting me to read it for quite some time, and now that I've finished I can see why. This novel is a perfect gift for a 14-18 year old girl, but all ages would love it."
4,Gripping!!!!,"This is a gripping novel, I could not put it down till I've finished it. Excellent Reading!!!!"
4,Good Book :-),"For those of you who enjoyed Jane Eyre, this is a wonderful book to read as well. Although it is practically a classic, it is very easy to read and the 400 pages go by fast (once you're past the first 100)."
5,One of my Absolute Favorites!,"I first read this about ten years ago when I was in high school and have since read it at least three more times. It continues to keep me interested (rarely do I read books more than once). I am a reader and could read just about anything I get my hands upon, but I think even a moderate reader would really enjoy this. The book is suspenseful and riveting, but also has romance for you romance readers. This is one of the few books that I have read that totally surprised me. Usually I can predict the outcome or come pretty close to figuring out how a story will end, but the first time I read this I was completely wrong (and happily so) about how it would end. Wonderful read!"
2,Boring (at least in the beginning),"I found the story very slow and boring (at least at the beginning,fortunately the end is a slightly better, else it would be very boring) is , the characters sometimes seemed to do simply nothing. The actions of the people are often not or only heavily comprehensibly, for example Mrs. de Winter. Why does she stay with Maxim after she found out his dark secret? In the movie it is more understandable. But I think the movie is much better than the book."
3,Weird Book,"I had to read this for Literature by Women in college. It's frustrating to read because the main chracter doesn't havea name, plus she complains a lot. It doesn't get interesting til around the 17th chapter or later. The end leaves you in suspense which is frustrating too."
4,Rebecca,"We chose this book for our senior project and it has turned out really good so far, we didnt really think the book was going to be this interesting and it keeps you wondering through out the whole thing. It's told by a nameless Mrs. De Winter who is living in the shadow of her husband's dead wife. She starts to uncover a mystery surrouding the wifes death and learns the truth about the former Mrs. De Winter. Be prepared for a surprise ending, it keeps you wondering. This is a MUST READ!!"
3,surprising,"I think it`s a good book. Not the best I`ve ever read, but really good. I like the fact, that you notice in the middle of the book, all is different from what you had thought. I was really surprised that Rebecca was such an unkind person! And that Maxim never loved her. I think the end of the book is also really good, because the whole book deals with things which have never happened, when Manderley, Maxim`s house, isn`t so important for Maxim any more. And at the end, Manderley doesn`t exist any more!But sometimes the book is a little boring. There are a lot of long dialogues, who aren`t really exiting. These dialogues are too long!But I like still reading that book."
3,The two parts,"The first part was terrible, a love story without love. It was boring. The shadow of Rebecca was spoiling the love stroy.I only give a star for the first part, but four of five stars for the second part. It's that way, which is boring, but why is it that way, that was interesting. Rebecca's death, the inquiry and Mr Favell's bad character were like a crime novel. The end was crazy. Manderly burns down, the great love of Maxim de Winter was always Manderly and now he has only Mrs de Winter (without a first name) and their relation of mistrust."
3,"a story about love, murder and intrigues","The book Febecca is the story about a young woman that falls in love with a rich man called Maxim de Winter, who owns Manderley, a great, luxurious house in Cornwall. They live together in Manderley, but Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, cast her shadow on that house. Rebecca died some time ago, and nobody knows exactly why. The drama increases with a lot of problematic monents and talks until the moment when Maxim tells his wife his horrible secret. The book is worth reading but I think there are better books and stories, and anyway it isn't the kind of book I like reading."
5,Its a MUST READ!!!!!!!,Just recently me and my bestfriend did a switchoff with books. She read my favorite book Jane Eyre and I read her favorite book Rebecca. Ive got to tell you its one heck of a book! Its details and twists and turns are amazing! The beginning though wasnt that interesting but the middle and end take up its slack!
5,This is one of my favorite books!!!!!,"The thing I love the most about ""Rebecca"" is the way the author tells the story. When I read it, I feel as if I'm at Manderley with the second Mrs. de Winter. Also, Daphne du Maurier never mentions the second Mrs. de Winter's name, and I think that is truly unique. This book has so many plot twists, that it makes one wonder how she got the idea for the story. This book is truly a classic."
4,great for book club reading,"I read this book for a book club. I would have never picked this book on my own, but I enjoyed it very much. Difficult to get into it at first, but after about 50 pages I was hooked. Hard to put down. The writing is not like anything I have read in current books. Very, Very descriptive. I wish it was available on Kindle!"
4,Almost Flawless,"Ok, so I'm only thirteen. But this book displayed great detail and almost brought you into the the whole setting and gave you a great idea of what the author created these characters to be. An extremely well written novel about love, deceit, jealousy and truth that deserves to be read by many."
