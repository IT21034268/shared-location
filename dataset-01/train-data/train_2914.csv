4,There is a reason why this item is tri-fold!,"Before buying this item I wanted to save money and take the DIY route. Indeed some online tutorials will tell you to get a piece of MDF cut into two 44""x48"" pieces from Home Depot or Lowes, which would be the bi-fold equivalent of this board, and cheaper. However after measuring our car carefully I found that there is a reason that this board is tri-fold instead of bi-fold. Without a much larger car it is simply a nightmare trying to fit that dimension into your car.So I ended up buying this top and did not regret one bit! It's very easy to set up in any home and I can imagine taking it to friend's house during a party. We don't have much problems with the creases."
3,Serves its purpose,"We purchased this for a Christmas present for my daughter. She loves it. Like other reviewers said, when you unfold it, some paint peels off. I wouldn't say it affects the performance, but it's a shame that it doesn't look brand new."
1,"poor construction, paint is pealing off, and the ball doesn't bounce normally","This looked like such a great idea and for the price, I thought it would be decent. The paint is pealing off and you can't actually play table tennis due to the folds since it makes the ball bounce in strange directions."
3,viper portable table tennis top,"the table was just ok , it folded in two places which was unexpected, I figured it would only fold once --where the net was but it didn't"
1,Mini cardboard table,The table is not a full size ping pong table.The material it was constructed of is about as strong as cardboard.table warps like a limp leaf of lettuce if not fully supported.Piece of $***$
1,"Raised folds in three, interferes with playing","This table folds in three, and the folds aren't clean so if the ping pong ball landed on it, it would skew. Also arrived with alot of scratched on it. I returned it."
2,Viper Portable Table Tennis Top,"As I opened the table the green coating came off at the seams. Although it looks very bad, it is usable and not worth the effort of returning."
4,Nice mini ping pong table top,I've had this for a month now. My nine year old loves it. He has gotten quite good and has asked for a full-sized tennis table. It's great if you have limited space. But your family may out grow it pretty fast depending on the age of your kids. I figure this will be good for my son until he is ten or eleven.
3,"Parables, exempla, religious teaching tales ...","Irma Zaleski's God Is Not Reasonable is another volume in a long history of teaching religious values and perspective through short, humorous stories. Think, for example, ofOne Minute Wisdomby Anthony deMello,Tales of the Dervishesby Idries Shah, medieval exempla, Jesus' parables, the rabbis' midrash ... In this long and illustrous tradition, the tales of Mother Macrina are interesting contemporary version, occasionally inventive and generally a decent introduction for readers not familar with the genre. As Christian stories, they avoid the concerns some express regarding the use of foriegn-alien-nonChristian stories - an issue that led to orthodoxy issues even for Fr. deMello. Beyond that advantage, the stories are all good but have better versions available."
3,Average Product,Having bought Geetings Card Factory 7 on a trip to the USA I thought this would be as good as it was from the same software development company. I was a little disapointed as it was not anywhere near as good
2,Humorus Greeting Card Factory,"I suppose my expectations were too high for this software, because I don't like it at all. Too much clicking back and back, and not enough cards to choose from."
2,Translator lacks emotion,"Pablo Neruda is one of my favorite poets of all time, however, William O' Daly does not do Neruda justice. His translation is flat and unevocative, and unable to invoke those true emotions that Neruda is famous for. I would recommend checking out translations by W.S. Merwin if you want the full ecstatic experience that Neruda usually so eloquently conveys."
2,too small,I thought they were bigger. The silver post were fine but the blue sodalite was way too small.The posts stand out more than the sodalite.
3,Drop Earrings,"These earrings are cute, but the stones are really smaller than the picture shows. They would be better for a young girl."
5,Just Like the others a 5 star review,I love the Tales of The Slayer books they are great this one is no different.
3,"Interesting stories, doesn't quite track with Buffy series","I've collected all four of the Tales volumes now and once again found some interesting stories to read. This time around all 8 stories are set around the Cruciamentum which all slayers are put through on reaching 18.I found that these writers (some of whom also wrote for the series) each had their own style and usually didn't tell their Cruciamentum stories anything like what we saw Buffy go through in the TV version, in some the girl's parents even knew she was a slayer. I haven't read the whole book yet but found, as before, stories running through the centuries- from Nikki in 1973 back to Esperanza in 1481. I didn't care for the beatnik story but thought the Spanish Inquisition story was interesting. I kind of liked Survivors and Sideshow Slayer. Jane Espenson's ""Two teenage girls at the Mall"" was one of the more interesting stories, and told mostly from the viewpoint of the vampire girl."
1,Do not buy from Health Check Systems!!!!!!,I purchased this gate from Health Check Systems and not only did they send me the wrong size (I ordered 25' they sent 18') they charged me $2 more for it and I had to pay shipping and a restocking fee! Go through One Step Ahead and pay the few extra dollars! They are wonderful. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM HEALTH CHECK SYSTEMS!!!!
3,setup isn't so easy,"the setup is painful, literally. two plastic pipes have to be hammered into the ground to set this up. This is not an easy task. I ended up hammering a smaller metal rod into the ground first to start the hole. This was the only way I could get the plastic pipes in. Once installed, works great. Highly visible and stops those run away toys from ending up in the street."
3,"Good for stopping balls, but not sturdy enough to stop a child","I bought this device to keep basketballs from bouncing into the street. So far, it works perfectly. However, it is not sturdy enough to stop a child or anything over a few pounds. I think the first time one of my kids accidently runs into, the side posts will bend and render this inoperable. Great idea, but I am concerned that it will not hold up."
4,Good enough...,"...but a child can easily pull the gate down and climb over it, so I would not use it as a gate to retain a child. It works well at providing an obstacle to the street and alerts cars not to pull in the driveway. It also keeps balls from rolling in the street. Quality is okay, but the retraction feature sometimes can be difficult to operate."
5,great driveway gate,"This is a great safety gate. We live on a 55mph road with a nice big driveway, and now I feel a lot safer letting my son ride his bike in the driveway. The retracting feature is brilliant. The gate closes up very neatly when not in use. The poles fit into two PVC pipes that are placed in the ground, which makes the gate easily set up and taken down. It sags a little in the middle, because our driveway is fairly wide, but it gets the job done. Perfect for anyone with kids."
5,retractable driveway guard,"This has been great..we don't have a driveway gate and it the best place for the kids to play on their scooters. it keep the kids their balls & toys in the yard. the only negative is that it tends to sag a bit, we tweak it a bit to stay taut."
3,Just a start,"As with all of the Conflict Resolution books, this book can only be used as the start of a discussion about being left out in social situations. Seems to work best in an elementary classroom, rather than a tool for parents."
2,Pretty But.............,They are very pretty and make a pretty sound but I have to untangle them every time the wind blows more than 5 mph. some were broken when arrived so they seem to be fragile but withstand wind.
5,Runge Delivers the Goods,"This is not my first encounter with Mr. Runge's work nor, I hope, will it be my last. I started with Rum & Reggae 2000, the definitive ""inside scoop"" on the caribbean, and I've been hooked on Runge ever since.This is not your ordinary travel guide. It reads more like a converstation with a friend over cocktails. And what better way to plan your next trip than to chat with a friend who has 'been there and done that'?Be it solitude or 'sauce' that you seek; deserted beaches or a little cha-cha-cha, you'll find it here."
1,Iron Jaw Angels,"Don,t know how to rate it. invoice says it shipped March 10,2006 have not recieved it yet, plus I thought I had ordered a dvd, in either case have received nothing and am getting no help from Amazon.com"
5,Better than Shel Silverstein,We're two boys in fifth grade and yesterday Mr.Lewis came to our school.We thought that your poem bubble was the best of all.
4,Poop or Moop?,"It is outrageous that they would make a book about poop for little buggers to read. It is disgraceful to our society. I, myself, try not to poop at all EVER. But everybody has got to go. In reality, i go twice a day and it is squishy every time. But enough about me. Here are the cons:1) It is about poop2) I don't like to pooppros:1) It is educational2) I like to change poopy diapersI hope you found this review helpful TATA"
5,"Wonderful, terrific, best poem book of all time",This book is hilarious. LW Lewis out shines any other childrens poet writer. Every poem on every page is knee slapping hilarious. Every teacher should read a poem a day to their class. They would become the coolest teacher. EVerytime we finish our work early we all sit quietly in hopes that our teacher will read us a poem. Some of them have a lesson within the funny story.
5,Tamilee is a great instructor!,I loved the Abs of Steel video with Tamilee as the instructor and this is a great DVD with all her best. Do a different workout each day!
1,BIG DISAPOINTMENT!!!,"Very disapointed with the quality of this video. I am sure that the ab excersices are great. But I only watched a few minutes then turned it off. It was so hazy. Like watching Barbara Walters on TV, everytime the camera pans To her, it's like the lens is coated with vasoline!!! I would return it, but it's not worth the shipping. I am disappointed that this video was released in this age of HD television."
3,Good Set For Beginner Martial Arts Movie Collecters,"This is a good set of old school kung-fu. I ordered this for myself but when I got it I found that I already have all these movies except for about three. I plan to give this away for a present to one of my friends. I just wanted to list the movies for the next person who might want to buy this set. I will not review the movies, just give the titles.1. Screaming Tiger. 2. Sister Street Fighter. 3. Street fighter. 4. Return Of The Street Fighter. 5. Street Fighter's Last Revenge. 6. Dragon Princess. 7. Karate Warriors. 8. Rage Of The Dragon. 9. The Crippled Masters. 10. Ninja Turf. 11. Dragon On Fire. 12. Golden Dragon. 13. Return Of The Tiger. 14. 36 Crazy Fists. 15. Blind Fists Of Bruce. 16. Black Dragon. 17. The Deadly Kick. 18. The Fists Of Bruce Lee. 19. Tattoo Connection. 20. Militant Eagle."
4,Amazing,"Frank Lauria captured the heart, determination, and motivation of a young girl who wants a better life. Consumed with anger she gets into fights often, but learns she can channel that anger by boxing it out. But she has her own problems with a neglegtic father and a part-time best friend. She meets Adrian, another young man with a dream, and they become involved with each other. It's an amazing story full of love, betrayal, and above all, hope."
3,Trying Too Hard,"This is AM's 2nd LP that was recorded in Nashville with such behind-the-scene pros as producer Chet Atkins, pianist Floyd Cramer, drummer Charlie McCoy, and Anita Kerr Singers. This is an obvious attempt to capture her top-40 hit (her last, as it turned out) ""I Just Don't Understand."" Some of the songs are quite fetching like ""Moon River"" and ""It's Not So Funny,"" because the production does not override the singer. However, most of the songs seem dated and bubblegum; even ""Fever"" and ""Heartbreak Hotel"" are pale imitations of the orginals. Two good contributions are ""What I Am Supposed to Do"" (released as a single) and ""Slowly;"" the latter number reminds the listener of Brenda Lee's coy ""Sweet Nothin's."" But Mr. Atkins made the mistake of marketing AM's talents toward the teen set rather than focusing on her jazz/pop background. Fortunately, AM's later albums allowed AM to expand in other directions besides the teenybopper scene."
4,Big Band Elliot-Mulligan,"If you like the kind of big band orchestration that grew out of the 1950's west coast jazz scene - like the arrangements by Bill Holman, Marty Paich, Pete Rugolo etc. - then I think you'll like this disc. Lawrence's band is essentially a first rate studio ensemble that works through a book of arrangements by Gerry Mulligan. 12 charts in all including a few Mulligan originals and a few standards. Not the best of the genre, but certainly worth the price of admission."
5,Absolutely Beautiful Dinnerware.,"This picture doesn't do the plate much justice. Plate in actuality is elegant and would be a great addition to your holiday dinnerware. I had rave reviews from family and friends on these plates. Although its ok to wash them in dishwasher, I love them so much I take better care of them by hand washing them every time we've used the plates."
3,Size Runs Big,"Comfy shoes, great for walking. But size runs too big. I ordered a size 8 and I have a half inch allowance on the size. Too lazy to return, I just use thick socks when wearing it. I should have ordered a size 6.5 or 7."
2,"A Reference, Not a Teching Guide","I found this book to be incredibly difficult to use. The grammar is briefly and poorly explained, and extremely poorly organized. This text must be supplemented with extra information from a qualified instructor. I do not reccomend this book to anyone who wishes to learn ancient Greek on their own. The accompanying texts book, however, I found to be rather well-laid out and heplful."
4,good if you have no problems with grammar,"In my view the book (along with the exercise and the self-study book) serves its purpose to make the adult learner read original greek as quickly as possible. It has 19 sections and several sections have a common theme (Socrates, Aristophanes, women in Greece etc.) what I like a lot. I am doing 1 section per week, so it leads me to (adapted) Platon in 5 weeks and I hope reading the first unadapted textes within three months. This is really exciting ! I've learnt Latin in school and I remember years of textbook work without much reference to original literature. I agree however with other reviewers that the grammar and exercise book is poorly organized. If you know latin and have no difficulties in learning grammar, the book is good for self-study. But you will have to redraw some charts on your own or use a reference grammar. If you prefer a clear exposure to grammar and don't mind reading original textes a little later, choose another one."
3,reading greek,I was disappointed that this used book had too many hand written notes on the pages and it was distracting from the original text and exercises.
4,Part one of the three part series -- Greek text,"This book contains the Greek text for the three part series. A break-through method for teaching classical Greek, the emphasis is on reading graduated levels of modified Greek texts from various authors. Rather than the traditional method of reading a few sentences, and a heavy dose of grammer, this series provides an excellent balance of text with grammer. The grammer and vocabulary is found in the second book of the series, and the third book is the ""Self Study Guide"". I would recommend that you purchase all three books for a complete two year course in classical Greek. If you have a background in Latin, or have a Greek teacher available, this course is excellent for self-study."
5,Graduated Reader,"As a self-study student, I found this a great way to learn Greek. I already know Latin and German and had some exposure to the language. It has graded materials and soon you are reading the ""real"" stuff. The selections are several pages long and taken from authentic texts.Note that this book does not stand-alone. You must purchase the other volumes in conjunction with this book. It has a special reference specifically for self-study.After a year I found myself reading Euripides and Plato. I highly recommend it."
3,The second book in the series.,"This book is designed to be used with ""Reading Greek -- Text"". It provides the grammer and vocabulary portion of the course. A separate ""Self Study Guide"" is also available. This book includes a reference grammer, dictionary, and grammatical index. The grammer is fairly basic, but has an interesting section on Homeric grammer. The vocabulary has some rather colorful entries == ""go to hell"", ""phooey"", etc are included. The emphasis is on reading and understanding the text rather than on providing an extensive grammatical reference. It strongest feature is that it includes a running vocabulary. Each section has a group of words to memorize, and you are not expected to learn all the new words for each section. Thus, the ""non-essential"" vocabulary is repeated for each section."
3,"Called ""Brief"" for a reason","I used this book during my freshmen year of college and I later found that this book lacks a lot of calculus material found in many other books. Here are my complaints:1. There is no trigonometry whatsoever (derivatives, integrations, etc.) in this text. Trig is an integral (no pun intended) part of calculus (that's why it's often referred to as ""pre-calc."")2. Only 8 chapters. Some of the lacking topics in the book are volume/area by rotation, infinite series, vectors, and l'Hopital's rule.So as I'm not a total whiner, here are some nice features:1. Book is written through an applied approach, so it is easy for the reader to learn applications of material.2. Examples in each section point to a specific exercise given in the problems portion of the section.As I said, lots and lots of applications, but the price paid for that is a lacking of thorough and necessary topics in calculus."
3,Cheap rings that do the job,"These are very simple but for the most part they do the job. The part where they cause the most issue is that they have to be very rigid to be good. I actually had one in the batch that was made tight enough so it's kind of unusable. Probably a 3.5 star and its alright for something cheap. I would suggest if you had the extra 5 bucks to get something that will last a couple times longer. If you are cheap, this is up your alley though."
4,Fascinating read!,"I was fascinated! I really enjoyed reading this fictional look into what could have been Mary Magdalene's life. I think Bettye Johnson did a very good job depicting what may have been going on in history at the time of Mary Magdalene; and she put in everything I like in a good book - history, mystery, and love!"
3,Okay,"I can't believe any listener in his right mind would want to hear two versions of the same tune in immediate succession. I'm deducting stars for the outtakes; we aren't paying by the note, especially not for the same notes repeated.I found ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"" fairly tedious; Montgomery doesn't seem to be much of a ""chord melody"" player. Otherwise this is a pleasant (but hardly earth-shattering) recording, and the second half of Montgomery's solo on the title tune has a nice groove to it. Elsewhere saxophonist Griffin steals the show."
5,One of two Wes Montgomery Classics,"This cd and ""Live at the Half Note"" are Wes Montgomery's two best cd's, and they are both live. If you like the one, get the other. If you have both, buy anything Wes did on Riverside. All those cd's are great!"
2,Intellectual Dishonesty,"As a PhD student in the UK studying religion and American foreign policy, I was hoping to find in Diamond's book a thoughtful and well-researched account of the religious right in America. What I have just read is a piece of shock journalism. Diamond's intent throughout is to paint the religious right (which she defines so ambiguously that it is meaningless) as a monolith whose unified intention is to support murderous dictators and greedy multinationals - whenever and wherever possible. This book is an excellent example of how ""good"" research - when it is driven by intellectually dishonest aims - produces ""bad"" (distorted/unbalanced) ends."
1,"Angrily Written, Granules of Truth",This is a very angrily written book. It is hard to take it too seriously even when there are some segments of truth. Author has an axe to grind.
3,Just OK,"Maybe it's becuase they are so small, but they don't really seem that ""super strong"". The plastic which makes up most of the dot is about 3/8"" wide, but the magnet itself is tiny; only about 1/8"". They don't hold photos on the fridge any better than any other magnets we have. And once they get knocked off - as they inevitably will - they're nearly impossible to find because they're so small. Like I said: They're just OK."
2,Super small!,"The magnets are not all that strong but they are REALLY TINY. Many have fallen and gotten lost within the first week.It's nice to have small magnets for kids artwork and stuff, I guess, but I like something more substantial."
3,Didn't work on my fridge,"My refridgerator does not hold magnets at all on the front, and that is the reason i bought these ones, thinking that they would hold onto it. Well, they didn't. I have seen people with the same problem that I have, it is a stainless steel fridge. If anyone can tell me where to find magnets that really do work, please let me know! Thanks. Oh, and they are super small as well."
1,Not impressed,Product came promptly from the seller good seller by the way followed the instruction to the tee the glue they sent is horrible doesn't inhere to the leather good needs to be re thought
5,A real money saver.,Great product and proven item worth the time and effort to install. A real money saver when you consider the added time the boots will last. I am a union millwright and doing maintenance work on industrial machinery and power generating turbines can really take it's toll on the toes of your workboots. These protectors double the usefull lifespan of my boots. They install easily and the kit includes everything you need to complete the job. I highly recommend these for anyone in the construction industry.
5,Best for businessTh,"This was the best buy in my life though I had to modify it slitly to work with my phone it's operation is flawless. The sound quality is better than the handset and the range is off the hook. As a independent Computer Consultant is important for me to have both hands free this fits that bill very nicely, it allows me to be more productive and give a professional service to my customers... I love this product!!!!Just a qick update, I've been using this headset everyday for the last 2 years and it's still going strong, its been a life saver with business allowing me to multitask while working. It is expensive but I've already had my money's worth from it. Great value for the money"
1,Plantronics CS70N - Wireless Headset - Disappointed,"wow - maybe it's just me. I have been using the CS70N for about six months - daily, I get customers complaining that they don't hear me, or that they are loosing me when I walk into the warehouse. I can make it about twenty (20) feet from my desk before this happens. My original headset, the plantronics CS50 was awesome - I used it for over five years and never had a problem- I could walk all the way to behind the back of our building (about 120 feet)and never loose a call. When I first received the CS70N, I was getting the complaints and I thought it was defective, so I sent it back and got a new replacement - Did not solve my problem. I wish I could say it worked great, like many of the other reviews, but for me, it is a huge disappointment. We also have someone using the CS351N, and having no problems with it, so I guess I will be buying another one of those to replace CS70N"
1,On my 3rd one.,"The first one worked for 4 months. Contacted customer service who were very nice, recieved a second one which after fully charging and was refurbished....would only last for 50min. Obviously the refurbished one went back due to the fact that the battery would not last. Third one is on its way. I am not sure what happened to the Plantronics quality but their refurbish QA is not testing the capabilities of the unit before shipping."
3,Ear piece,"It's ok. I don't really have anything to compare it to but here are some things I noticed:1. The range isn't that far (if you are just sitting at your desk but need cordless, it's probably fine - but I'm up walking around the office)2. It doesn't alert you when the phone rings.3. The good thing is that it is light weight and I don't feel it."
3,plantronics,"I have used these in the past, however this one was repackaged and not new. I expect more from Amazon, however I am sure this is beyond their control"
2,Poor Perfomance Even Worse Amazon Customer Service,The product just would not ever work without sounding like you were in a tin can.The echo was terrible. I went through the set-up procedures and sequences over 5 times on every combination of settings you could try. I even bought a new phone to see if the phone was the problem.The only thing worse than the product was the customer service from Amazon. I will think very hard before I buy anything from Amazon again.
1,Do Not BUY! Design Flaw!,"I loved this headset until ...Great earpiece, great sound quality, comfortable...then it fails after the warranty. I have about 5 of the CS70 and about another 6 of the similarly designed Bluetooth version in my company. The problem is the design flaw with the base. If you look at the cradle where the earpiece sits, there is a little ""retaining clip"" that hold the earpiece locked in so the contacts are touching at the bottom to charge. That ""clip"" will break or lose its tension (usually just after the warranty period) and the earpiece cannot charge. We have people using rubber bands to keep the earpiece in place while charging overnight. I have talked to Plantronics and they will exchange it for $95 since it's out of warranty. Yes, I was shocked when the first user reported the breaking clip to me, then another and another... It is a design flaw. That piece of plstic does not have the elasticity or strength to bounce back after a year of usage. Just a warning..."
1,DOES ANYONE MAKE A DECENT HEADSET????,"This is the biggest piece of crap I've ever purchased. The headset broke literally the day after my warranty expired. Needless to say the folks at plantronics were less than helpful. I've managed to tape it back together, but after 2 years everything is broken. The lifter stopped working after about 18 months, and the stand just kicked the bucket a few weeks ago. I expected more out of a bundle I paid $230 for.Unfortunately Plantronics seems to have a good monopoly on the market and it looks like I may have to give in and buy another one."
4,Good sound quality.,"I use this with a regular land line phone. You plug it in as directed on the instructions. To use it you lift the handset and push a button on the earpiece to turn the earpiece on. The sound quality is very good. Microphone seems good, nobody has complained they cannot hear me. Volume is adjustable. There is really no detectable interference. There is no head attachment so you must use this over the ear. That would have been nice. Sometimes in a hurry it is tricky to get it situated on your ear correctly."
4,works well,I use this everyday for work. It allows me to move from room to room and still stay connect to my phone. It is easy to install and can answer any call with one button.
3,It's OK,The thing is smooth and I semi like it. One huge issue is that the audio clarity is poor! Otherwise reception over the length of my office is good.
5,Excellent product,"This is the best hammer for the professional who wants a truly excellent tool. Everyone has specific needs, and so you'll need to be choosy as to what suits your purposes best - but you can't go far wrong with this hammer. Beautiful!"
4,"nice pocket camera - images great, video only OK","I wanted an inexpensive pocket-size camera to catch those spontaneous cute moments with the kids. This camera had really good still shots for the money, lots of fun built-ins (like present frames, highlights and color blocking) and is very easy to use. The video was important to me, and if I wouldn't have tried another camera at the same time, I probably would have kept this camera. But the 640 video didn't measure up to the other camera I tried. If you weren't going to use the video feature much, this is a FUN, good quality little camera."
4,great little family camera,"I have been looking for a camera like this for a long time. After doing some research on digitalcamerareview.com the Samsung Digimax A503 was the best camera for my needs. I'm not exactly a photo freak, but I do have 4 wonderful kids that are growing up fast. This camera has been a excellent experience. The screen is huge and the photos are almost perfect. There is sometimes an issue when I have the flash on and the little ""shaking hand"" icon comes up. I highly recommend also buying a memory card because the camera does have a small memory. Overall, this is a great basic photographer camera."
4,Quality camera,"This is a very good camera at a great price. The only drawbacks are the lack of digital zoom and possibly the reliability of the manufacturer for digital cameras (samsung). Other than that, it does everything it advertises very well."
5,the best,"I decided I wanted this a while before i got it. As I read reveiws I realized majority of them were postive. There is nothing wrong with it, the microphone works really good but you can not watch your videos with sound on the camera. It can take around 300 some pictures and about 60 minutes of video on Super sine mode, where it uses the most megapixels. It is definetly something I would recommend for anyone."
3,mostly good but a few problems,"I bought this camera for my budding 10.5 year old photographer son. He loved the camera, it has great features, however as others have said it is a battery eater. There should be an adaptor option or battery charge option. Yeaterday my son was walking around with camera in his pocket. Maybe not the best move but he did not bang or drop the camera and yet the screen cracked. Camera will still take pictures only you can't see what you're doing. An eyehole would have been helpful. My son has only had this camera since 12/26 so I'm very disappointed"
3,OK,takes decent pictures in day with plenty of light but when the sun goes down or you are in a dimly lit room the pictures do not turn out well and trying to take a picture without the flash only works if you don't want to know what you were taking a picture of because they turn out blurry. Even after holding as still as possible and it looks decent on the display when you get them to the computer they are still blurry and out of focus.
3,It's fine,"The camera is fine and actually stores pictures a little faster than most digital cameras but I'm returning mine. An optical zoom is so standard on cameras that I didn't even notice that this camera didn't have one. It does have a digital zoom but on this camera, it's useless. If you use the digital zoom at all you loose resolution... and not just a little. The picture is severly compromised. So, if you never ever anticipate the need to zoom, not even a little, it's a decent camera."
5,works well in the field,This is a good camera for the type of work we do and does not have the pop out lense that when you drop it it quits working. It fits in my front pocket just like a pen and it takes great pics. I wish they still made these for I wood buy 20 More of them.You dont have to be a rocket scientist tp operate it either. So for us we are going to give this device a 10
2,bad for indoor pics,"you can hardly get a great picture indoors bcos-- it's never bright, and looks like it was taken at night. Without the flash, picture comes out blurry. it's good for daytime outdoor shots though..."
4,Good but not complete,I'm a Disney poster collector. And this book shows a lot of their best posters - but t his is not enough for a collector. We need a complete book with at least their US poster releases plus ranges of the latest prices.
1,Not Pleased,"When I bought this book, I had no idea that it was the miniture version of the larger book. Therefore, I received somethin I would never have bought had I known the book wa about 4''x5''."
3,mother goose pop up,"i loved the whole idea of a pop up mother goose book and i was going to give it as a first birthday gift...however acouple of the pop ups didn*t open and it wasn*t the quality i expected...so i didn*t give it as a gift, but i did keep the book."
2,Flimsy construction,"Unlike other Sabuda pop-up books, this one seems to be rather flimsy. The pop-up elements seem to be straining the covers they are attached to. I would choose another of his titles. I like Alice in Wonderland and Cookie Count and both are more durable."
5,Wow - pretty much covers it - you will be amazed,"I love all the Robet Sabuda pop-up books. They are amazingly detailed and this is no exception. Gorgeous book, and appeals to adults at least as much as to kids. The incredible skill it took to make this book is more likely to be appreciated by adults - although we are all enchanted by the pictures."
4,Great gift for a child,"I bought this book as a gift for the flowergirl in my wedding, she is 4 years old. At first when I recieved it I thought it might be too young for her, however, seeing her eyes light up when she opened it changed my mind for sure. She kept calling the book magic! As many of the rhymes are familiar to her she thought she was reading, and being a reading teacher I know that memeorizing text is the first step to actual reading, so anything to get a young child interested in reading I am all for! One problem I did notice while just looking at the book myslef is that once the book has been opened a few times, a few of the pop-ups begin to get difficult to close. But overall, an incredible, magical book!"
2,A bit disappointing,"While I loved the conceptual design of the book, I found the quality of the paper and printing to be poor. The first time I -an adult- tried to open the 4 and 20 blackbirds page (very gingerly), I managed to rip it in one place. This just should not happen for a children's book!! Perhaps the type of paper used is too rigid for the movement. Colors were not as vibrant on the inside of the book, either."
3,Delivery Concern,"Questions to seller a)shipment time indicated in your ad is too short,except,allready at your shelf (2-3 business days)b)Packing the instrument;it is moisture sensitive,in a rainy daywood worps.It is made out of wood.Above concerns prevent me to attampt to purchase the instrument."
4,Soap,I am partial to fresh products and I liked this soap. It seems to really get the oil off my face and it smells great.
1,DID NOT WORK,I INSTALED SOFT WEAR AND IT DID NOT WORK. THEN I CALLED THE TECH IN CALIFORNIA AND WE SPENT ONE AN A HALF HOUR ON THE PHONE AS WELL ASHE TOOK OVER MY COMPUTER AN NEVER COULD MAKE IT WORK. I RETURNED THE ITEMAND HAVE NOT YET SEEN MY CREDIT GOOD LUCK WITH THIS ONE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS IF IT WOULD WORK THE WAY THEY SAY IT SHOULD BUT IT DID NOTJV
1,Lousy packaging info.,"I rec'd Volume 3 as a gift. Listed performers on the box are such as Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, and others. What's on the disc are Brubeck, Hawes, Kenton, etc. Everything's fine until the end. Frank Rosolino Quartet. Halfway through the third tune, the disc cuts off. Lousy.I like most all of the performances but the disc that came in the box doesn't match what's printed on the program.Disappointing."
1,Just get it from Project Gutenberg,"I had already downloaded the Project Gutenberg e-Book version of this when I ordered this printed book. What a total waste! The ""publisher"" of this printed book probably simply downloaded (the ""no images"") EPUB version from Project Gutenberg, printed it using COURIER font on plain paper, and had it cheaply bound with paperback covers. The product description states that the book ""may not contain images"" or some such thing, but I thought that only referred to the Kindle version. My kid loves the (black and white) pictures that she sees in Project Gutenberg HTML version and asks me why they're missing from the book that I got her."
2,Typeface is way too small.,"I read the reviews that warned about it but disregarded them and now I find myself wondering why, with such a small typeface, is it still so thick?"
3,"Print very hard to read, I am returning.",The print is not what is shown on the Look inside. It is hard a to read font.The layout is not at all what I viewed on-line.
1,picture is deceiving,the bible which i recieved looked nothing like this picture & had something sticky all over it. i would like to return it & receive the one in the picture. the covers aren't even the similar. this gunk on it is grouse. i feel I've been ripped off.
1,Does not work,"First review: They are batteries, so my only concern is that they have staying power. So far, they seem to last a satisfactory amount of time.Update (4/29/11): The power drained out of unused batteries in less than a year. I'm unhappy with my purchase now :("
1,universal battery low quality,"This battery is not good quality, its down in camera 15 photos only,, duracel is gone atleast 60 photos...not work as looks."
3,Batteries,"Good but feel the Dates that other National brands use would be helpful. For the total cost your savings is minimal. Still a better Deal if you need smaller packaging of batteries, also better controls the quanties you want to buy."
3,Everyone needs batteries anytime.,"Here is the reason why you should buy these Universal Batteries.The price of a 4-pak of $1.29 is perfect.If you want to get your ""free shipping"" from Amazon, but only need to spend a few more dollars and cents, this product is eligible for the ""Free Supersaver Shipping"".You can buy these batteries as a Christmas gift or stocking stuffer.You need batteries for times of emergency.When your batteries run out of juice, don't you wish you had some batteries around for the meantime until you can go out and buy your favorite brand? Universal batteries can be tucked away in your drawer for when you really need them. Who wants to go out in the rain and when it is cold just to get some batteries.It's better to play it safe and stay home and have some Universal Batteries ready in your kitchen or bedroom drawer."
4,Product substitute,"I recieved a KSC USP compact system 7 instead of the KWA advertised. It is comparable, but would have been nice to know previous to getting in the mail. The manual I received looks to be in chinese only? Unfortunatly I don't speak or read Mandrin."
3,May be enough for beginners only!,"After doing Leslie Sansone's WATP videos for about three months, I bought this video for a change.THE BADI am in no means in perfect shape, but this video barely got my heartrate up enough to burn a decent amount of calories (according to my HR monitor). The video run length says 52 minutes, but the workout portion itself is barely 30 minutes long. By the time I started to feel I was getting a workout, the cool down began. I actually ended up doing a 2 mile WATP workout after this video to increase my calories burned.THE GOODThis video would be great for those that are very new to exercise and have very low endurance. The moves were simple and easy to follow, even the first time I did this tape. The instructor had a nice positive attitude, but did not annoy me at all throughout the tape. It is rather refreshing to see plus size people in an exercise video.THE BOTTOMLINEEven if you are plus-sized, you may not get enough of a workout using this video."
4,Easy,"I cannot dance; that is no matter with this video. Very easy to use. I have a heart condition that prevents me from doing any intense exercise...this video is perfect for those looking for low impact, easy steps. Will be buying more Debra Mazda videos for sure. She is a good instructor and with larger women doing the steps with her, I enjoyed the workout."
3,Workout for real size people,"This video came brand new and in perfect condition. I wish I had watched it before trying to workout with it, and I recommend anyone who buys this does watch it first. The instructor does not explain the movements ahead of time and they are not always easy to follow. However, the music is bright and cheery, and as long as you keep moving you are getting the benefit of the workout anyway, even if your moves aren't quite right. I like Leslie Sansone's walk videos better, but this is a nice change to keep things mixed up."
1,Not a beginners' low-impact workout!,"I was very disappointed in my purchase. A true ""beginning"", low impact routine is slow-paced, with moves that are not difficult, or hard on the joints. This routine is fast-paced and requires quick, wide side steps that are painful and possibly damaging for hips and knees not in condition for these moves.During the workout, I could not reduce or eliminate moves that were too difficult. The pace was too fast and I could not keep up. If you are out of shape, or have reduced joint flexibility, difficulty stretching, or only fair cardio reserve I would NOT recommend this DVD!That said: this would be a good beginners' workout ONLY if you are flexible in your hips and legs, have good coordination, timing and strong cardio reserve."
3,Good ~ but Oh my knees~,"I like this workout. ~However, I will say I have to make a few modifications. My Knees have a hard time with some of the moves. I can't do all the twisting. I do feel like I get a good workout. But remember your Knees."
4,"Fantastic roleplaying, top notch ideas.","After buying and playing through the d20 version of the game, I decided to take a look at Hollistic's own Victory Point System. While a few of the rules are a bit muddled, over all it's easy to learn, and much like its author's ""older children,"" the custom character building is fun and more personalized than the d20 system. I'll give the story/setting 5 stars for being a beautiful synthesis of Dune, the Phoenix Guard, and many many of my favorite books and movies, but 4 stars for the system which, much like with the author's previous works, is unclear at times, though ultimately great once you've learned it."
3,Humorous and Smug,"This is a cleverly written little book that will make anyone from 40-65 laugh at themselves. Essentially it is about the fatuous nature of the ""Baby Boom"" generation. Anyone who can harpoon Elton John, Phil Collins and Billy Joel in one paragraph is ok by me.The book however, promotes a methodology that I think is useless. Specifically, culture in terms of generations provides us with no useful information and nothing could possibly be changed by that effort. It would be more accurate for Queenan to describe the decayed culture (with some exceptions I agree) in terms the times. What we have today is the culmination of many ""Generations"" work. Thinking in terms of approximated age groupings really is pointless as (you already know this) there is always an overlap.I found myself often laughing, wincing at my own self indulgence but not taking much of this to heart"
2,Welcome to Smug City...,"...Mayor, Joe Queenan.Maybe I shouldn't review this book, as I've always hated Joe Queenan. First of all, he's a self-described ""Pop Culture Critic."" Well, hell, so am I. So are you. So is anyone with an opinion. Any schmoe can be a Pop Culture Critic, because it's easy and requires no digging or research. All it takes is a brain, a pithy opinion or two, and a smug, self-satisfied outlook.Mr. Queenan, of course, has all three. The man can write (I'll give him that), and he has a sense of humor, even if his lists of Baby Boomers' dubious contributions to society get a little strained. But on the whole, his observations all come down to one thing: the self-aggrandizement of Joe Queenan. But hey, if that's how you get your kicks, go for it."
1,Joe Needs a Change of Pace,"In answer to ""a reader from New York"", most people are well aware that Queenan's writings are satirical. But that doesn't automatically make it funny. I doubt that anyone is looking for a message, or for the true meaning of life when reading satirical prose. So for the Boomers that are offended by his observations, you are missing the point. The fact is, ""If You're Talking To Me, Your Career Must Be in Trouble"" was outragiously funny. ""Red Lobster"" was a bit of a step backward, and this book is just plain tedious. Like any other form of writing, you can go to the well once too often. For those who can't get enough satire, try Tony Kornheiser-""As Bald As I Want To Be"" or Norm Chad-""Hold On Honey, I'll Take You to The Hospital at Halftime."""
2,I expected a funnier version,"Joe Queenan's wit descends all too frequently into wise-guy cracks, and, although his book will make you smile, it quickly grows tiresome. While some of his wise-guy observations are right on target, I expected a more generous take of our shared generation. Let me say in defense of his carping view of our ""self-importance"", that we baby boomers are the largest, best educated generation in American history---and thus the most competitive, although many of us found that those born in the decade ahead of us had taken the most of the slots in science, in academia, and in various other fields."
2,I've read better ...,"I think Bobos in Paradise was much better in handling the subject matter. For wittier writing, try anything by George Carlin or Dennis Miller."
2,Not enough irony to disqualify the hypocrisy,"A clever rant articulating the writer's wit and skill with the language, rather than an intelligent criticism. I think the author has confused the dregs of society with those who were radical in the sixties; thinking they are one in the same, rather than different people entirely. Apparently the Baby Boomer generation had best just accept that they're old, and settle down to die, rather than living life as if they still enjoyed it, because it annoys the author.This is not a researched criticism, just a long rant that was very hard to read past page 100 as it got more mean spirited and basically expose the author as rather spoiled, self-centered, and thoroughly ignorant of history. I tried my hardest to find a Twain-like irony that would reveal the author was much more clever than I thought. Alas, I failed."
3,Good magazine piece padded to book length,"This book definitely has some very funny moments, and I even thought he made a few good serious points about the Baby Boomers, but it would have been much better off as a magazine piece. At 200 pages, this is a very short book, and yet it begins to drag halfway through. He falls back on too many unfunny devices to pad the length, particularly the seemingly endless series of sequences involving lyrics or titles from songs. I always love reading Queenan's short pieces, and even though I agree with most of what he's saying about his generation, I don't think it merited a book-length treatment."
2,pseudo -intellectual redundancy,"Too many lofty loose ends decorate this book. Historical references up the wazoo, but they miss any connection to what is being posited. I laughed sometimes, mostly while reading the introduction. There you have it-- the puerile nature of a boomer (moi). The immaturity mainfested by the writer is most evident by a persistent need to flaunt his education. This type of education is littered by complex references. I think ""Balsamic Dreams"" is the ultimate irony-a sellout commentary masquerading as a critique."
1,The author is his book,"This book accomplishes one nonsensical objective: to make fun of a group to which the author is a member ... thus, giving him an air of moral authority. Nothing positive has been accomplished with this book, other than to diminish the author, which is fitting. He may have assumed that his persona of being a caustic critic supersedes a sense of responsibility to be forthright and fair. That he chose to write such a book is so revealing. This book makes him out to be his stereotypes: whiny, self-absorbed, and materialistic. We get your message, Joe ... you are your book, but thankfully, you are in a small minority of people who view the world with such an absurd sense of self-righteousness."
2,an amusing and pointless rant,This guy thinks he is funny and hip.He is really just dated and irrelevant.
1,BALSAMIC NIGHTMARES,"Well I think you obviously have to compare this book to any P.J. O'Rourke book, and the difference is night and day. While Mr. Queennan drones on and on with inane dribble trying very hard to be funny, Mr. O'Rouke is somehow very funny without trying so hard.This is at best a good magazine article.On page 30 Mr. Queenan Self-reinvention paragraph makes no sense. Where was the editor? He has the nerve to say Dennis Miller is not funny.Mr. Queenan 'A short but Self-Important History'is not short enough."
2,Just read the first chapter,"I found the sample promising and bought the book for my Kindle. The first chapter was okay. After that it's just more of the same corny rant. Like ""everyone's stupid and I hate everything."" Tiresome. Sophomoric.One would like to know what the author actually DOES like."
5,A must for Ted De Grazia fans,"The cookbook is as good or better than any other of its genre, but the illustrations by Ted De Grazia make it a book to be cherished. The recipes are well presented and tasty, but the artwork is magnificent!"
5,Best Bluegrass Instrumentals,"This is one of my very favorite bluegrass instrumental albums. The musicians are some of the very best on their instruments. I play this album a lot and if you like bluegrass, you will too!"
5,this is a great book,A friend gave me this book as a gift. I didnt think it would be a very good book. I got bored one day and decided i would read it. Once i started reading it i couldnt stop. this book only took me 2 hours to read(which is very good for me). I like how the book never got boring. there was never a dull moment in this book. this was the only book i could find that had to do with the future and computers. i guess what im trying to say is this is a great book to read. and i cant wait to read 2 & 3.
5,"""dissaster""",Doomsday is a reilistic fictionm story. A girl finds part of a computer chip that caused a computer virus that messed up all the computers in the world. Now people are panicing. Find out more in DOOMSDAY.
3,"Good, but I've read better","It was good, and so is the rest of the series, but how many of these books are there? I think the story is being stretched out a little. I would recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction/action stories."
4,A Learning Experience,"The book was an insightful, realistic, yet humorous look at some common and not so common gay sex secrets that were tried and true methods as well as more exotic ideas. Information that, to my knowledge, had not been previously explored in print. I will definitely be trying a few of the tips that I got from this educational book. I would hope that the author will revise and update his work periodically, as the need arises, to include tips for mature gay men as well."
5,Great!!!,"Although the cover does look pretty interesting. The book is very.You might think:""Ohh great another book to teach me how to get the guys."" Well this one is very creative. The writer writes in a very cool and easy tone. Its almost like a conversation.AMAZING tips and Details of how to get your partner on his toes. Highly recoment for ages 18-30, after that I think the experience catch up.Ohh, and great Illustrations, Very Clever. A+"
4,Instructive but wordy,"Pluses: A good self teaching book. With no previous Autocad experience I now feel confident that I can do basic 2-d drawings. The book got me to accomplish what I wanted, to learn basic Autocad, so basically a good recommendation. The pace was a contributator to confidence building.Minuses: It could be written with a third to half less wordiness, the author drags out the instructions and basic Windows operations too much. I feel I should have been able to do the basic drawing in much less text.Chapter 7 was very boring and took forever to get through with very little return for the time spent.And the book only covers an single architectural design.I would like to see other mechanical design example walk-throughs added with shorter text descriptions. More to-the-point.Also it is difficult to find exactly where you learned something when you want to go back and refresh yourself, mainly because of the wordiness."
3,Good but written for Architects & I'm not..,"This is a good book but it is written for architects. I'm a mechanical engineer. Also, it basically has only one project that you progress through from beginning to end of book. I took a que from a previous reviewer and checked out ""shrockpublishing.com"" and their books worked better for me. (Exercise workbook for Beg. AutoCAD) Easy to follow, 30 separate lessons, includes many exercises and for all disciplines not just architecture. Plus I emailed the author with questions and she answered me."
3,Need a disk for practicing,"I am a new user and is the first time to explore autocad .I bought autocad 2000 of David Frey, but without the disk I can not use it. I need help, I am appreciated for those who would help me how to get a disk to apply this book.Again, thank you very much"
4,latin cards,I'm going to be using these with my 5th grader next yr. but I did get them and the only thing I see that I didn't care for is that they don't give you the pronunciation of the word and if you're like me I don't know all of them so I'm going to have to look it up
3,English From The Roots Up Flashcards 1,"The content on the cards is wonderful. However, these cards are made out of flimsy paper and will not withstand use by children.I went to get them laminated to preserve my investment and that was going to be another $25! So I spent another $10 and bought a roll of clear plastic and we hand cut and covered each card ourselves. This made the cost of these Flashcards to be almost $30! Had I known that, I would have made my own cards for this curriculum like I did 20 years ago for $2 on 3x5 cards.This was disappointing that the cards, themselves, we're made of such inferior materials. We have homeschooled 10 children over 25 years. I have never received Flashcards that were so flimsy rendering them unusable by children. Why offer such a help to your curriculum that is of inferior quality?"
4,Fun learning,"Arrived promptly, in stated condition. We will enjoying learning our roots this school year."
5,Proof that it Helps,I used this book when my daughter was in her primary years. We played the games and created the cards. We formed Greek and Latin combination words as fun challenges. She was able to read Old English literature with ease. She soared through Biology because of her root word knowledge. She has thanked me several times over the years for this fantastic foundation. She is a successful college student and her ACT scores were fantastic.
1,Quality of the lens was crap right out of the box. :-/,"I ordered two of the Hoya DMC Pro1 Clear filters to use as protection for my lenses since I frequently shoot in inclement weather. Both filters arrived in sealed packaging but BOTH had visible scuffs and imperfections on the glass. Not the seller's fault but how in the heck can Hoya produce a lens filter which is going to seriously degrade the image quality of the camera they're being installed on? It's either that or the quality control at Hoya is slipping, because I've never seen this issue on their HMC and S-HMC filters."
3,Nothing exciting,"Although this CD does have few interesting mixes with modern rock style, it does not break the ice. After few songs, they sound the same.No variation in beat and very un-creative way of presenting this ""hip"" idea."
4,Fun family movie,"Dead Man on the Run is a fun family movie. It's been my experience that children under 12 and adults over 40 enjoy this movie the most. The movie has a good story line, but it doesn't have all the special effects teenagers and young adults are looking for."
1,The cradle worked for about two weeks then quit.,"The cradle worked for about two weeks then quit. Also, the product pictured was not the product that was delivered. It was functionally the same, but not the same as pictured in the ad. Being sent a slightly different product worked okay for me. Being sent a product that didn't work was not even slightly okay with me. I plan to shop for a Pa1m brand cradle next... ...at Amazon, of course.HAL"
3,"not quite what I expected, but OK","I received a cradle which has USB and AC power connectors, a ""cigarette lighter"" type charger, and an AC charger (in addition to the cradle).The item I received had an ""Osmon"" logo, not the ""Insten"" pictured. The cradle does not have a hot-sync button on it, so I need to open the hot-sync application on my Treo.Another reviewer had said that you could use this unit to charge a spare battery. The cradle I received did not have a spare battery charger. I contacted the seller and they sent me cradle that would charge a Treo 680 battery. That was nice of them, but I wouldn't count on it. If you want to be able to charge a spare battery, find a unit for your specific model that has that feature."
2,Gets the job done.,"The best I can say about this is that it gets the job done. There is not much to it. When I first got it, I put my Treo on and it synced up fine. However, that one time was apparently enough to pop the plug out of the base. So, you couldn't plug it in anymore because the plug pushes down into the base. I opened it up and super-glued the thing back together. Now it works fine.So, if you want to save some money, and you have a tiny screwdriver and super-glue handy, then this item will get the job done. Otherwise, you might as well buy the one from Palm. My father owns it, and its great quality at a higher price."
2,"Does the job, but wears out","Upon delivery, it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but the connectors fail after a short while. This is due to the design flaw that tries to adapt one single design to many different socket designs."
3,I Knew In This Heart Of Mine,"Beyond Alison Krauss's crystal-clear vocals and some fine string players, NOW THAT I'VE FOUND YOU is blessed by a fine selection of tunes and the kind of immaculate production found on modern blue-grass recordings. Anyone who listens to Krauss, and other quality bluegrass, with an open ear will be pleasantly surprised by the big beat found in this drum-less music."
2,some good songs,"If you like Alison, you'll probably like this CD. I found a couple of songs I enjoyed. The rest I ignore (I recorded the ones I liked on to another source). If you are not a big fan of hers, there are better samples of her work."
5,AWESOME!!!! AK an US are the best bluegrass musicians,"Just when I thought that there was absolutely no way that any CD or concert could be better than this CD, I saw Alison in concert last week. She has the voice of an angel and the grace of her fingertips on the fiddle is amazing. This was the first CD I had ever purchased of hers, and I literally wore out the CD. I traveled over 50,000 miles in a year's time listening to this CD in my car as I commuted from work to school. The concert was the best I've ever attended and this is my all time favorite CD."
3,"Good, Solid, Country Music","If this is Bluegrass, what is the difference between it and Country? Interesting version of The Beatles ""I Will."" This album doesn't have the almost universal appeal of Garth Brooks, but it is good country music."
2,Overrated,I've heard all the hype about Alison Krauss and her musical influence on artists such as Nickel Creek. I wanted to see what I was missing out on given Alison's reputation and tried this as my introduction to her music. This highly rated CD was a major disappointment to me. She sounds like a little kid singing and all but a couple of songs sound the same. A little too country style for my taste.
5,Nice review,This is a very nice review of Ms. Krauss' solo work. She has a characteristic voice which resonates throughout this whole collection. Easy listening of a classic voice!!
5,"Excellent music! I had to buy the CD, my tape wore out.","Alison's voice is so unique and enjoyable I would reccommend this CD to everyone and especially to those like myself who love to sing along. The harmonies are wonderful and her choice of songs is perfect. I had this music on tape and since I got my CD player in the car, I missed it so much I had to replace it."
5,The greatest!!!,"I was not a country music lover, but this CD turned me around. Allison sings like and angel and the songs are from the heart. My very favorite."
5,Alison Krauss,I love the convience of Amazon shopping. I can easily find what I am looking for. I received this item in perfect condition and when it was supposed to arrive. I'm very happy and pleased and will continue to use Amazon.com in the future.
5,Now that I've found yu,"I enjoyed each cut on this album. Great listening for an individual, or could be played in a business for background music. Glad I bought it."
3,A little disappointing,"The tunes are okay, but most lack the power and polish of the songs she did for the ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" soundtrack, the fabulous CD which turned me on to her amazing voice. I'm not a huge fan of gospel, but AK clearly has an affinity for it as the strongest pieces in this collection are the gospel songs she does with the Cox Family. I'll be keeping an eye out for her future works."
3,Good one for a six year old,"Overall I liked this toy for its price. Here is what I found about this Holey MoleyPros: durable and also you don't need to hit hard to make this work, even my 5 year old is able to tap this one to make it work. It did not take more than 5 minutes for my 5 year old to start playing the beginning level. Just put the 3 AAA batteries and you are all set to go. Very easy to hold and play the game.Cons: There is no power-off switch, according to the instruction book leave the toy for 2 minutes and it should switch off by itself. There is no pause button, if you need to take a break, you need to start the game from the beginning.Overall good one for this price.-Raj."
3,Fun-put a bit painful for the arthritic.,"I fell in love with the Whack a Mole game. I love the sound of the moles and the remembrance of the pizza place game. This game is a lot of fun, but the buttons are small and cause a bit of pain trying to move the mallet on the screen from the ground area to the sky to whack the planes and parachuting moles.All in all, a very fun game to appease my Whacking senses."
4,Seems okay,"It's not top-of-the line, but it works. A bit dim, but not bad for the price. Does include a spare bulb. Yep."
1,Poor Quality,"Very flimbsy, can't get it to hold into place, and light is too dim. Honestly, it's junk."
4,Nice Clock,"I love this clock. I did have to turn down the volume to it's lowest setting. Otherwise, it reverberated too much."
2,Perfume,"I ordered 2 bottles of So In Love, however, one of the bottles is defective, the sprayer will not stay on or spray. I submitted a request to return said defective item, and was informed that a return label would be issued/mailed, but I still have not received one."
1,Smells BAD!,"I have been buying this parfum for years since it has been discontinued from Victoria's Secret and this is the worst smelling parfum EVER!!! This is not the parfum So In Love, if so it went VERY BAD!! It smells horrible!! I usually by this on another site but decided to try here, never again for this item. I have bought many other things here on amazon and very happy except for this parfum."
3,Take a Closer Look...,"While 'Dharma' does contain some interesting historical information on Indian religion, its true purpose is clear. It is merely indoctrination propaganda for the hare Krishna religious sect. It has an obviously one-sided look at the historical events surrounding the creation of this sect of Hindu, and the origins of the Bhadavad-Gita, its most sacred writing. My copy was given to my by a Hare Krishna on a street-corner who was handing them out and asking for donations. People who are interested in the Hare Krishna movement will probably find this book of interest, but it isn't for everyone."
1,does not work for veins,I tried what Dr oz suggested with the butcher's broom and it really did nothing for little blood constricted veins. Oh well
4,Malia,"I have just barely started using this product, waiting to see results. This product arrived quickly before expected arrival day."
4,Almost Great,"Usually the final book in a trilogy adds resonance to the entire series. In this case, readers may enjoy Dugan Under Ground better if they haven't yet read its predecessors--in particular, Derby Dugan's Depression Funnies, the second book in the series. Dugan Under Ground is a fun, vibrant romp, full of wonderful period detail. But the characters don't resonate the way characters in an exceptional tale do--or as they do in Derby Dugan's Depression Funnies.To put it another way: If you read Derby Dugan's Depression Funnies, you'll laugh and you'll cry. If you read Dugan Under Ground, you'll laugh. Which in and of itself isn't a terrible thing."
3,I can't quite see Jeremy Brett in this one:,"It's 1901 and London is in mourning. Queen Victoria has just died, and the new king, Edward VII, is ready to ascend to the throne. However, as Holmes and Watson find out, the coronation may have to be postponed a bit. It seems that someone has stolen the Crown Jewels from the Tower, and Lestrade is desperate for Holmes' help to find them. The theft of the Crown Jewels brings Holmes into contact with the ""eminent thespian,"" one William Gillette, who is currently in town to play Holmes on the screen.The plot was good, but I was a bit mystified at the solution -- it seemed somewhat contrived and it sort of came out of left field. Somewhat better than many of the works of Val Andrews, this was an okay pastiche and didn't take more than an hour or so to read. If you're considering a pastiche by Andrews, this one at least won't shy you away from others."
2,Hard to put on,"Of course my 2-year old loved these shoes, but they have sewn a rather tight piece of elastic under the tongue and velcro closure that makes it very difficult to get on. This isn't mentioned in the item description. As another reviewer did, I cut the elastic with scissors and the shoes worked well - but I didn't expect to have to do that to a brand-new pair of shoes. Seems like a design flaw."
3,"Great look, tough fit","Great looking shoe. My son is a big Lightning McQueen fan and he loves them. Only downfall is that it's tough for my toddler to get his feet in the shoe. He's very independent and he was able to put on his old shoes, so it was disappointing for him to have to now ask for help to put his shoes on."
2,Disappointing Translation,"Having looked forward to this translation because of the supposed improvements in it, I was very disappointed to see all the poor and erroneous English usage. Its and It's are confused repeatedly; lay and lie are also misused. It is as though the translators may understand Czeck but aren't sensitive to English! These points would surely have been caught by any kind of editor--my book group decided that there must not have been one at work here. All of us were most unhappy that the promised, and hyped, good reading was not ours! And several members had read the earlier translations, with more pleasure."
1,What a disappointment,"Svejk is not an easy book to translate - after all, Hasek was an anarchist. I've read the Penguin translation and it wasn't bad but stilted and very British English. This new and improved translation is quite simply terrible. A translator needs to know not only the words in both languages, but correct grammar as well. And this English speaker/writer does not. Stick with the older translations."
1,The Good Soldier Svejk,"Unfortunately, even with a new translation this book is a failure in English. Many of the subtle jokes and jibes are simply not recognizable to Western readers. Characters such as the vulture Bretschneider, raving Police Inspector Braun, the savage Dr. Grunstein, the drunken Chaplain Otto Katz, and all the others are simply the same character moved around a bit.Essentially, the same thing happens over and over. The English reader comprehends about half of it, and is left wondering why in the world he bought the book in the first place.I know I am."
4,Good Try But No Cigar,"When I saw this new translation of Svejk in a bookstore I immediately bought it. I love the novel and I have always thought that the Cecil Parrott translation, although good, wasn't quite ""it"". The problem with Parrott's translation is that it is a little too formal compared to the Czech original (incidentally, I'm fluent in Czech, so I know what the prose should feel like). This new Sadlon translation promised to remedy this situation, so optimistically I plowed right in, hoping for the best. Unfortunately, although the language has been (appropriately) ""roughed up"" a bit, the prose has suffered. Hasek's prose flows. It feels ""right""; it doesn't jar. Unfortunately, Sadlon's translation at times does. Parrott's prose is, I think, closer to the original in its feel, while Sadlon's vocabulary is closer to the original. Blending the two, I suppose, might be the answer."
5,Amazing,"I found that this book was absolutely amazing. After reading John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces and looking for something to match its wit and humor I discovered Svejk. The tale follows Svejk and his time in the military during WWI. Its main character, being a notorious imbecile, gives the book outstanding humor. Svejk never plays by the rules, in spite of that, he manages to seem innocent. Some of the reviews said that it translation was horrendous but to me it seemed perfect. This book is a unknown, must have, of world literature"
3,Somewhat amusing,This book was recommended by a Russian friend. I enjoyed it for a change of pace but farce is not one of my favorite genres. There is little about the historical facts of WW1. The social commentary could probably apply to any military and police organization at any time.
4,Excellent overview of Incident Response,"Incident Response: A Strategic Guide to Handling System and Network Security Breaches provides an excellent introduction into the concepts of IR.The book covers all of the main areas required for effective incident response. There are a lot of real world scenarios written to provide the reader with a feel for what is truly required of IR.The book is geared towards the high level and does not provide much hands on information. Those looking for a heavy hands-on tome for IR will be better served by reading `Incident Response' by Kevin Mandia & Chris Prosise.The only think I found lacking in the book was an overview of third-party software applications that can be used for a Computer Incident Response Team.Other than that, Incident Response: A Strategic Guide to Handling System and Network Security Breaches is an excellent read written by two experts in the field."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A lot of the entertainment here is in the character interaction, with Black Lightning showing up, and the Huntress giving Nightwing a whole pile of crud, in a truth hurts you still want me mode.A suitably evil bad guy in Sabbac and those pulling his strings make it reasonably entertaining, but you don't need to go out of your way to get it."
2,B-A-D,"I hate that I wasted hard-earned money on this one. The first volume is pretty entertaining, and out of boredom alone I purchased vol. 2 out of town.Ouchies.This book is bad. There will be moments that you might enjoy, but overall you'll kick your own ass for buying this, and then kick again for reading it."
4,Just beginning and already enjoying the rollercoaster,"I read the one star review saying that the author only sought to know what happened to her parents, not getting to know them personally. I would hate to presume to know what that persons experiences were, but as the child/grandchild of victim/survivors.... everyone is dead, my father made it impossible for me to get to know the ""real"" him because his desperate need prevented him from being a parent to me, his needs so desperate that manipulation was his means. I will never know these people because alive, they were cold and distant. She nails my feelings on the head, the desperate need to find the story, so I can remember what they needed to forget. So I can understand that the things I hated about them, it wasn't really them. It was what was created for them."
1,What a disappointment,All I can say is that I hated the book. The author was so intent to find out all the sordid details of her parent's life during the Holocaust that she never got to know them for who they were. The book is boring and the drawings are silly and juvenile.
1,Unhappy,"The title for ordering this item was, Shirley of Hollywood Rhinestone Studded Venice Shelf Bra & Thong & Garterbelt. My boyfriend ordered this for me assuming, because of the title, that it was a three piece set. We are very UNHAPPY to have come to find out that it was just the bra, which was way to expensive to say the least. We really think that you should re-word you items so that there is more clarity, or at least don't group them all together to make customers think they are a package deal. After coming in contact with the site, I will be spreading the word on how horrible things turned out.Sincerely,KAM"
4,The Pale Criminal,Philip Kerr is just getting his narrative up to speed in this novel. In the main the plot flows smoothly and is most interesting
4,A City Without Hope,"Philip Kerr's THE PALE CRIMINAL preaches the absent of hope in Berlin in the last years prior to WWII. Everything and everyone is decadent. Survival alone counts as a monumental achievement. But, having lived another day, policemen Bernie Gunther wonders what mere survival is because what good is living if your life has no meaning. Kerr puts Gunther in the middle of a murder investigation where he has to toe the line between historical villians Himmler and Heydrich. The persecution of the Jews is unrelenting, and the corruption is nearly unbearable, but Gunther's determination to do his job keeps him going when everything around him is crumbling. Not a novel for light reading, but one with a coherent story and a likeable protagonist among monsters run amok."
5,Wonderful deck that provides gentle guidance!,"If you are spiritual & like oracle cards then you will definitely appreciate this oracle deck...I tried a 3 card reading and also a 1 card reading, and got insightful guidance...the amazing thing was that I actually felt my palms get warm when I shuffled the deck and felt my fingers reach out to the chosen cards by virtue of intuition. The readings were incredibly enlightening and I loved the depiction of angels & saints. A beautiful, spiritual deck!"
4,beautiful drawings,Beautiful drawings but the box is small for the cards. cards can easily be damaged due to the box
3,Beautiful illustrations,I loved the illustrations but I was looking for something with motivation or description on the back of each card. In this set you have to review the book to use the most thoroughly. Similar to tarot cards in their use.
3,On the Job with Bob,"Nowhere did it mention this was a coloring book. The story is the same as the series, except this is in black and white. The window stats were my sons favorite part..."
4,A great coloring book for fans of the show!,"My daughter loves watching Bob the Builder, so we were very excited to find this coloring book for her. She couldn't wait to hang the window decorations in her room. A very cute book!"
2,Protron 32-inch,"I actually have the Protron 32"" LCD TV which I purchased from QVC.com. I must admit I shouldn't have jumped on the LCD wagon so soon, because this version does not have the HDMI port and actually took some muscle to disconnect it from its stand. I've had this unit now for 2 years, and compared to other LCD models, the resolution is not so great, many of days I've spent trying to adjust the color/resolution but to no avail. Plus it irritates me that while channel surfing it takes several seconds before the picture actually appears."
4,It works in Win Xp Pro,"So far so good, Install went well. I've been using product for about a week and it functions as advertized !!!"
4,Good for the price,"This is a digital pedometer, about 1 x 1.5 inches in size and is easy to carry around for a lunch time walk. There is no memory, fancy settings, just calories, distance in km or miles. I have calibrated the distance against my other pedometers and is accurate for my stride. It has been dropped and hasn't broken. Would buy again."
3,pedometer,The price was good (inexpensive) - I really only wanted something that would tell me the number of steps I took during the day. this does more than that - not too bad for an inexpensive pedometer.
1,EMM,"This is a piece of junk. It looks like something you would get at a dollar store. It arrived ans does not work. Screen is completely DEAD. There is no contact info, no number to call. Absolutely DISGUSTING."
3,Cabbage patch Magic glow in the dark,"While my granddaughter loved her cabbage patch, she thought most of the doll would glow. It was only minimal. There are glow in the dark stickers included, but they don't last long on a cloth doll. Overall it is a Cabbage Patch and she will be well loved."
3,An OK book,"Not one of my favorite books on comms and listening. It is a little bit all over the place. However, I liked the quotes, examples, and tips (wherever there were any). I wish the book offered more techniques and tips."
5,"Practical, not fluff","I found Journey to the Emerald City to be a book that really gets to the nuts and bolts of shifting an organization to a performance-driven culture. There are a lot of books on organizational culture out there that are really more fluff than anything else. Most books give conceptual examples of how to improve performance, but there are no tools and real life application to make the ideas into reality, not to mention to make them sustainable. Journey to the Emerald City outlines the process of shifting an organization's culture based on experiences, beliefs and actions, instead of just focusing on telling people what to do. The book explains that an organization cannot continue with ""Culture One"" if it wants to produce ""Results Two"". This book is simple, yet powerful."
5,Excellent Read,Journey to the Emerald City has been a very good read. We live in a time that no one wants to take responsibility for themselves or their work. As this book brings to light we lose so many rewards that praticing accountability brings to our lives.
4,Journey to a better work environment!,"The concepts outlined in ""Journey"" have really helped the company I work for recognize where we have needed to change. It is so true that experiences create beliefs and beliefs create actions that inevitably effect the results of our organizations. When peoples' hearts and minds get involved in the cause, the sky is the limit! I've seen our sales increase this year tremendously due to the alignment of the goals and ownernership that everyone has taken. You can just feel the excitment in the air. Everyone knows what the goals are, why we have them, and when they need to be achieved."
4,Good foundation knowledge of Islam and the Koran,"I live in a country surrounded by predominantly Muslim countries. About 20 percent of my country's population is Muslim, so a good understanding of Islam is both important and useful, and what better way to understand Islam through knowing the Koran? This book covers most of the important topics in the Koran. Do not expect an in-depth coverage for a book less than 300 pages. It gives you the basic knowledge and hopefully stimulates your interest in the holy book of the Muslims. I already know quite a fair bit about Islam before reading this book, as I have some Muslim friends. But glad to say that the author still managed to add to my knowledge. The most important contribution of this book, in my opinion, is that it clarifies some common misconceptions of Islam and Muslims. Read it with an open mind and I am sure you will be captivated."
2,Truck,I bought this truck a few years back for a gift. It has never run. But since it was a gift I just never worried about it.
1,watch,will never deal with these people againvery rude on the phone if you have a question about thereproduct...
3,Gift giver,"To be honest, I was a little disapointed with the watch, It was intended for an everyday work watch, & I found it complicated. Other than this, It is fine."
5,Beautiful acoustic guitar at it's finest!,"If you love Jobim, and guitar, you will love this CD. Also incorporated with orchestra. A lovely Album. I recommend highly! David"
2,Volume 2 OK -Buy volume 1!,"Wow I love the first volume of this series! but volume 2 is just ok!The reason is Volume 2 was not done by the same producer/ remixer as volume 1.So im going to stick the ""Shanghai Lounge Divas, Volume 1""Not bad & worth checking out,Looking forward to volume 3"
4,Finally found a it,"I've been looking for two of the movies from this bundle for years. I""m very satisfied with this purchase. Thanks"
5,Flip Flop Fishin' Fun!,"My granddaugher loves this game! She plays it again and again, sometimes just playing with it like a toy, flipping the fish. I'd highly recommend it !"
3,satisfactory,"It serves the purpose, although the packaging is unduly expensive given that its small size container requires one to buy many."
1,Assault on reason and Science,"While the bell curve was not a perfect book, it is mostly accurate and scientific. This book is neither of those two things. It seems to have been written to allow close-minded anti scientific liberals a way to try and refute the undeniable science of the bell curve. To take this seriously, is to deny science."
3,Retape this item,Great product because of the ease of use. Plug it in and you are ready to go. Six years later though the moisture gets through the cheap friction tape and corrodes the steel crimp connectors. So my recommendation is to retape over the friction tale with a good electricians tape and it should last a lot better. The electronic module also gave out on mine but it might have been caused by the wires going open or shorting. But for ease of use it is a plug and play connector.
1,no dice,This item did not fit my 2003 Nissan Frontier. The connectors were all wrong and the wires were not the right length. I returned it for a refund. Maybe it was mis-packaged.
5,Heart Wrenching,"This book was so moving. I was literally crying at the end of this book. Rebecca did not deserve all the suffering she went through. I recomend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the Morman religion and how it all got started. This book made me cry when I learned how Morman husbands treat their many wives, and the things they think they have to do to EARN Heaven."
5,So awesome goldfish loved them!,goldfish love these specially in tanks or ponds. They take a liking to them and sometimes follow these around like crazy LOL!
5,Excellent in Every Way!!,"I was VERY pleased to have found this, because not only am i still able to be one of the last(seemingly!)VHS hold-outs, but this story does not require a DVD to be GOOD!!Jessica is just beginning, and it is awfully fun to see how she kind of gets ""roped into"" solving this murder. It also sets up a lot of the background of the Show, and you see ""your favorites"" as they first appeared--both character-wise and physically.I knew this was the absolute FIRST ""Murder, She Wrote,"" and was happy to have found it at such an attractive price and in such good condition."
2,Poor and dissappointing,"The train seems to be big in the pictures but in the reality the parts are very small and delicate, fragile and sensetive.It is good as a model but not as a toy for children..."
5,Best free weight workout I've seen on the bookshelves.,"Complete and easy guide to establish objectives and create a safe, effective program. Defined programs at the back of the book are excellent for entire body workouts and make implementation easy. I used it the same day I bought it and have continued for years. I recommend it often and always hear positive feedback."
4,Still a useful book,"I bought this book maybe 10 years ago and still use it. The programs are simple and easy to do, the explanations are clear and the pictures are useful. Some of the pictures do look like they are from the 70's, but that is a minor point. The book is a good one if you want to get in shape usining dumb bells or other weights at home."
1,Lights of America FluoreX 9012 lights poor quality,I've purchased two FluoreX 9012 fixtures with 27 Watt CFL light bulbs. Properly installed and sealed them. They stopped working within a few days. I had to remove them . I spent a lot of time on buying installing testing removing them. Here is a link to Lights of America FluoreX 9012 model [ ... ]
1,Decent performance offset by poor quality,I purchased probably my last Lights of America product this year.I've had two of this model that burned out in under two years andnow a later model replacement has also burned out. The bulbsdon't last as long as advertised (4-8 months at most) and twoof the three LOAs had cracked or missing lens covers. The casingis somewhat flimsy as well.My guess is the manufacturer is using substandard parts orwhole circuit assemblies made in China.If you buy this expect to have to replace it much sooner thanexpected!
5,Works Well,This is a replacement fixture for the one that has been working for 13 years that finally wore out. I have anotherfixture in another area that is still functioning great.. The bulbs are easy to replace. Well worth consideringwhen you need some light for security purposes or just to illuminate an area you walk.
5,These images broke my heart.,"This book was exactly what I expected from such a sensitive and intelligent man. Thank you, Mr. Gere. We need our hearts broken now and then."
5,Pictures with soul,"The pictures are not supposed to show images but meanings. That's exactly what they do. They are visual metaphors, inviting us to see what is not visible. The first one, more than any other, in its deep beauty, allows us to catch a glimpse of a spiritual state or an epiphany. If I had taken it I would feel forced to share it with everyone, as Mr. Gere kindly did."
5,Beautiful book,"This book is really special. The cover, first of all, feels so wonderful. The pages are on incredible quality paper. And the photographs are incredible. It's really a wonderful book."
5,This was a great book,"I liked this book, but at the end it irratated me that Lila didn't get any punishment for what she did... sometimes i hate LILA so much i wish something bad happened to her.. she can be such a snob."
1,"Hope it doesn't blow up, mine did? yikes","EMU support was completely DOE for over a month last year (absolutely off the map) Links down on website and everything, rumor was creative was going to discontinue the EMU line. Now the support section of the web site is back up but support is EMAIL only and if you do get to talk, you will talk to someone in India, AND if your 1616m preamps spark and catch on fire like mine did during that period and your warranty expired in the mean time, they will NOT honor the warranty, so RUN FAR AND FAST from EMU in general. and the 1616m Preamp jacks are sensitive and might spark out in a short while (mine did)."
5,Fearless,"Tony's work is fearless. When I listen to this I hear an artist who is unafraid and willing to experiment. He mixes venues, introduces new instruments and creative percussion while preserving the spirit of tradition. An extraordinary young talent with a drive like no other."
3,Soccer Modern Tactics,"I am a soccer junkie, so i get into books on strategy. However, with this book, it seemed like the book had been translated from Italian. The English was awkward and I had to go back and re-read sections because they just weren't clear or the phrasing was awkward. Also, I kept having to refer back to the symbol guide to understand the formation diagrams (does that squiggly line mean he passed the ball, or he ran the ball or he ran without the ball?)So, in summary... interesting content, but the text wasn't user friendly. The author needs a good, English journalist to clean it up."
3,Good info -- but very DISAPPOINTED.,"Good info BUT... VERY DISAPPOINTED it was not better rendered for English speaking audience (What? The English don't play futball??). Comic and sometimes confusing trans-literations abound in this book making it appear that I am listening to an Italian possessing only a moderate command of English language -- There is some really good stuff here but you have to work at it to figure out what the author is getting at....Clearly, this book was poorly ""proofed"" (at best) and most diagrams simply mislabeled. This sloppy editing is sure sign educational books are not a high priority for the author. Feels more like a series of lengthy magazine interviews w/ Zauli and some diagrams tossed in but just expanded into a book. Again, good info but don't buy it expecting everything to be laid out in front of you.Overall, good information but could have...SHOULD have been much better."
2,Non Fiction,"Somewhat interesting, maybe a translation that lacks something.Anyway, this is focused on soccer from the Italian point of view, so a bit more emphasis on defense, and the defensive situations and formations that they are long acquainted with."
3,"Good Tactics, poor graphics...",Could be better...Soccer tactics needs good graphics to better explain the formations.Just in 4-4-2 we have a universe of possibilities that coud be explored in the book.It's a good book but could be better.
5,A great mailbox and great bargain,"Pros:- Holds A LOT of mail. Big enough for a daily newspaper.- Magazines, fliers, DVD's, and large envelopes can lay flat inside- A yellow tagged flag automatically pops up whenever the door is opened to insert mail (needs to be manually reset when you pick up the mail).- Easy to mount on any standard post. I made my own out of a 2"" pipe and scrap 2X4, some black spray paint, and a cheap bag of cement.- Attractive in a simple utilitarian way.- Withstands the weather well, at least here in San Diego.- Simple strong construction should last for years.- Smooth panels on side to stick name and address on, helpful for substitute mail carriers unfamiliar with your mail route.Cons:- None discovered yet."
5,Best mailbox around!,"I've had the large version of this mailbox since 1995 and the only reason I'm looking at replacing it is because a snow plow kicked up a stone this past winter and cracked the door in half and knocked off the flag. This thing lasts! I live in New England, so it's seen its share of cold and snow as well as heat and humidity. Large envelopes and small packages fit inside with no crushing or folding required.The plastic has weathered on the outside, but you can get paints made specifically for plastic to freshen it up. I have some made by Krylon that I was planning to use before the plow wrecked the box. This is the best mailbox I've seen anywhere."
5,Mail's here!,"I love this mailbox, without it my mail-lady and I would have a far more strained relationship - at least when it comes to her trying to get all of my mail in a normal mailbox. I get a lot of mail, catalogs, stuff from amazon, other shopping etc. And before I bought this box from Amazon it never fit in my box. In fact my mail-lady specifically asked me to get a bigger box because she was tired of having to climb the half-flight of steps to my front door to put the other ""half"" of my mail in my door. In the 8 years since I bought this from Amazon I haven't had a single issue with it. It still looks great, and works perfectly. I love the fact my catalogs and magazines fit inside and stay flat, I adore the part where many of my packages fit inside safe from the rain and prying eyes. And I really like the mail's here flag since I do have to go down those aforementioned stairs to check my mail. One glance out the door and I know for sure if its there or not."
4,IT IS HELPING ME.....,"I HAVE NO FINISHED READING THIS BOOK, BUT SO FAR SO GOOD....IT IS HELPING ME TO IDENTIFY MY AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT....SOME OF WHAT I HAD DISCOVERED, NOW SEEMS OBVIOUS BUT ONLY AFTER READING THE BOOK....BEFORE, THERE WAS NOTHING OBVIOUS"
3,"And now, the Larch...","What posessed me to buy this CD? What on earth was I thinking?I don't know, frankly, but I'm glad I did. While it doesn't tell a story the way it's genre-mate, the soundtrack to Ken Burn's Civil War, did, it does set a time and a place effectively.The few vocal tracks are a little hard to stomach. I understand the history of the music just fine, but I still think the aural picture of modern day white men singing in this manner is more akin to performing in blackface than they may realize. There is no intent to mock or insult in this recording, but there is still something a bit odd about a 21st Century white man from a gentrified area of Virginia singing ""I thought she was g'wanna kiss me when she took and pulled my nose"" in some...uh...rural accent.Call me picky.Still, I like the CD. Recording it is important, listening to it is enjoyable."
1,Just don't think about it,"I ordered a refurbished one with confidence that I'll receive a (almost new) device because I order it from ""amazon warehouse deals"".What I got was a defective one, it was not working. The only thing I see after turning it on is the dream'eo logo and that's it. What makes it worse that I was outside USA when I received it and the cargo company wants to charge me 3 time more than the device itself.I thought maybe I can solve it by contacting the Dream'eo company but that was just waist of time cuz (no one was there) to helpDream`eo Solo 20GB Portable GPS and Media Player"
5,"""Serindipity Means Location, Location, Location""","The amazing feats of genealogists are not always accomplished by lots of hard work. Sometimes, as, the stories in this book illustrate, success is accomplished by just being at the right place at the right time."
1,"Poor, even for a book of it's genre","One could find far better books in this genre to recommend. Has all of Holder's weaknesses in spades: poor characterization, sloppy plot, and no sense of the show universe she attempts to write in."
5,A delight ...,"This one's been sitting on my shelf for two years. Who needs to read a book about no one? No one. So I forgot about it until today, while weeding my unruly book collection. What a delight! Avoiding most cliches about life-writing and full of hard-won honesty, this collection of thematic essays from one ordinary-but-not life abounds with truth and sensitivity. Better than most biographies and most memoirs, the unflinching revelations by this one-out-of-many individual won my respect and my heart. Spring the $.38 and try this one. You won't be disappointed."
5,"A Captivating, Practical and Exciting Book","Christy's book is poignant, interesting, relevant, and written with refreshing honesty and a clarity that leaves readers understanding deep Biblical truths and excited about living them in the day to day details of life. It is fast paced, captivating, and thought provoking. This book is a great catalyst for personal reflection as well as small group discussion on each core value for students and young adults. I loved reading it and bought copies for both of my daughters, one in her twenties and married, the other in college. It is encouraging and challenging for all ages and could be the most important graduation gift a high school or college student receives this year."
1,DOES NOT WORK!!,"I bought this cd from Scholastic for over $15 and it doesn't work on newer computers. My Amazing Human Body has a copyright of 1997. When I tried to install it on my Windows XP, I got a message that it might not work because this cd is for Windows 95. The computer was right, it didn't work on Windows XP. The outside of the package said it should work on Windows XP, but it sure doesn't work. What a waste of money!!"
1,Not truly Windows XP (or Vista) compatible,"Wouldn't install at all on Windows Vista. Product claims to be compatible with XP, but gave an error and exited. Search the web for ""my amazing human body xp patch"" to find a patch. Even with the patch, though, this is clearly very old software that is not truly XP compatible, as the term is used in industry. Publisher is selling very old goods; this hasn't been updated in 10 - 12 years. That's fine for a book, but not for software."
3,Glaring Omissions,"How can you put together a collection of Sidney Poitier's films and NOT include such true groundbreakers as 'To Sir, With Love' or the amazing 'Guess Who's Coming To Dinner' - which is not only landmark for it's 'subject matter' but also was Spencer Tracy's last film??? I don't understand it. At first I thought this was going to be a great collection - and it is by virtue of being centered such an amazing man and actor - but it's not the set it could have been... or SHOULD have been. I'd rather buy the collector's editions of the individual films.The man is a genius - this should have showcased that."
4,Great deal,"A good deal. Five of Sidney's greatest movies. Includes the Academy Award Winner ""In the Heat of the Night"" and it's sequel.A must buy if you like Poitier. First Black actor to win an Academy Award for Best Actor. Not a bad flick on the set. Worth the price. If ""Lillies"" and ""Coming to Dinner"" were on it, it would be Five Star."
2,Lids are tough to open/close for kids,"I bought 2 sets for my elementary aged kids - grade 4th and 1st. The price was a little too much for tuperwares but I thought I'd try because of the nice stacking design w/ a blue ice inside. Today was the first day of school and I had my 4th grader try to open/close the lids before i started packing lunch this morning. He had a hard time opening the lids and snapped them back on, I didn't even bother to have my 1st grader try it. They ended up going to school with their good old Ziploc containers which they had no problem using. Too bad I already prewashed the containers and couldn't send them back."
5,Great Buy!,"Impressive storage, extremely convenient, and well-designed. An excellent lunch box for those who have outgrown cartoon characters and plastic thermoses."
4,Good item,"I personally do not use the small containers inside the bigger container, but LOVE the huge container. Its really hard to find a large container to cold a salad for lunch that isn't about 5 bites. This will hold a LOT of salad, so you will not go hungry. I wish the lids would stay on a little better, but overall I like them."
3,Works Ok,"Overall this works ok. I've been using it for about 1.5 years now, and the small containers are a little hard to open but seem to close well. The ice pack does keep your sandwich (or whatnot) cool, but it's kind of a hassle to keep all the little parts of this set together. I've since re-purposed the ice pack for aching joints and the small containers for hold sliced vegetables for cooking, then I just dump my food for work into the big container.Keep in mind that the large container is a little bulky, so make sure whatever you are carrying your food around in has the dimensions to accommodate it."
5,Beware the dishwasher!,"I bought this lunch set as a convenience for packing lunches for workdays. Very convenient, and just the right size for my needs. The only problem I had was that the little lid from one of the upper compartments slipped through the top rack of my dishwasher, which lead to an unfortunate encounter with the heating element. I would normally deduct a star (or more) for that, since they were advertized as top-rack safe, but I was very pleased when I contacted the Fit & Fresh customer service department about it. I asked if they sold replacement lids, and they promptly sent me a free replacement of an entire small compartment (box & lid). Considering how hard it can be to get in contact with customer service departments anywhere, I was thrilled with how they handled the situation. I would definitely buy this company's products again."
2,Innovative Design Poor Execution,"The design of the Fit&Fresh Lunch on the Go is excellent. It is very convenient to have everything all in one chilled container. However they could have executed it in a bit heavier plastic and maybe gave you a half inch more space between compartments. I can't even fit a sandwich in the bottom compartment without it pushing the ice pack up. It is very difficult to close with a sandwich and the two containers and ice pack in place. Even after hand washing the container it is already showing signs of warping. I am hesitant to actually run it throw the dishwasher even on the top shelf. Maybe if Fit & Fresh 2.0 comes out I would consider buying it but otherwise I would look elsewhere or by some of the disposable gladware containers, an icepack and an insulated lunch box. It would probably be cheaper and last longer."
3,Just okay,"I was excited about the product. It's a great concept but the material quality is medicore. The products quality is below the familiar Rubbermaid and/or Tupperware. I'm apprehensive about putting in the dishwasher. However, functionally, it does what it's supposed to do."
3,Cheap Plastic,"I was looking for a lunch box to take to class and found this product. This containers are the perfect size and everything fits into one box. However, after its first washing in the dish washer (top rack of course) the plastic warped. I have to struggle to get the lids on and I secure the lid of the large container with a rubber band so it doesn't pop off in my bag. I suggest to all who buy this to hand wash the containers whenever possible."
3,A little too big for easy packing on a school backpack,"I would say it is a good start design for a better piece on next edition.If the box was a little slimmer (less height) it could fit better on a school backpack.However, the two level layout is great since the ice 'cube' appears nonexistent.I am happy with the ""not so fit"" though fresh Lunch on the ""not to easy to go"" lunch pack, since it works but I am not excited about the purchase.Yet to confirm, how resistant will this material be to a non-frequent monthly use."
4,Toss Up,"I don't use this container as much as I thought I would, but when I do use it, it is exactly what I need. Example: bringing taco salad for lunch, I was able to separate the salad, meat, and chips so nothing got gross. Works well when you need to separate things until lunchtime, but not my everyday lunch container."
5,Fantastic!,"I love this product and am buying another! These are great for lunch and I have been able to use it for everything including, salads, entrees, sandwiches, and soups.As others have said, the lid can warp. But I no longer have a dishwasher so this problem has been basically eliminated. And even when it does warp, you can still get it on.I love these containers!"
5,Fit and Fresh easy as can be,"I was given this item for a birthday present a few months ago. I love it, its so easy to pack my lunch now and just the right porportion sizes. I bought another one to pack my breakfast in, I get everything ready the night before and in the morning all I have to do is slip the ice pack in and I'm ready to go. I highly recomment all the Fit and Fresh products for packing meals that we eat away from home."
3,Not bad.,"I like it. Like the convenience and the ice tray insert. Although, it was cheaper at Bed,Bath,& Beyond."
3,convenient but heavy,"I like to make bento lunches, and this is a convenient box to take with me when I'm packing sandwiches. However, the ice pack that you put in the box makes the entire package HEAVY. Otherwise, it's still a great container for simple lunches and snacks. Do not put any liquids in the containers, though."
5,Love this product!,"Not much to say except that it serves the purpose intended well. I can pack up a sandwich or leftovers in the bottom, add two sides and the freezer insert and everything stays cold until lunch time. It also allows for portion control, so I don't pack more than I need. I purchased 2 other products from Fit & Fresh, with the same results."
4,Good buy for the price,"I bought this for my 6 year old's school lunches. Works great and fits a great amount of food including a juice box. I like the cooler pack that can be inserted into the top. The lid cracked after about 5 months of daily use but for the price, I guess I shouldn't expect too much. I would buy it again even though the lid cracked. I found an insulated bag from Target that this box fits into perfectly."
1,If you want your dressing all over the place,"I like packing my lunch and I was really in the market for a product like this. To my disappointment this product does not live up to minimal expectations. Right out of the box the container feels cheap and one can tell that it is not air tight. Bottom line is if you want something that will not leek, this is not the product for you. If you want something that will last, try something else. It is too bad really. But compare this to some other brands and you can tell a difference right away."
2,Won't recommend buying,"The containers can't be sealed after a few times' use. I only used it for a very short while, now I'm shopping for some better quality lunch box."
2,Snacking size only,"I bought this for my husband trying to encourage him in healthy eating habits. Now I'm half the weight of my husband and clearly not a big eater, but I think anyone would find it hard to pack any amount of much in this. I'd have to give this a ""no"". Probably a great choice if you're looking for something for your toddler or younger child."
2,Doesn't keep cold long,"concept is wonderful but could be made much better. Plastic is really thin. Feels like it will break fast. Lid seems flimsy like if I were to drop it, all the contents will fall out. Also, the ice keeps cold for about 30 minutes. But I do like the compartments w/in the compartments. Overall, I think I wasted my money."
1,"Cool Idea, Failed Execution","I found these dishes at my local KMart store. I was SO EXCITED to find dishes that had built in ice packs to use in my child's lunch box. When I got them home, I put some water in them to test how tight of a seal they have--imagine my disappointment and disgust when I realized that these dishes LEAK. Now I am going to have to return them as I don't feel like they fit my needs--especially for how expensive they are. After all, how can I pack applesauce or cottage cheese and feel rest assured that they aren't leaking all over my little one's lunchbox?! Who even designs plastic food storage that leaks anymore?! I am beyond upset! What a waste of money and a waste of my time!"
5,MOST ENTERTAINING BOOK EVER!,"I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWERS, THIS IS A MUST HAVE BOOK THAT WILL GIVE YOU HOURS AND HOURS OF INFORMATION AND HUMOR. DID YOU KNOW THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE ENDS ITS EVERY WORD EITHER WITH A VOWEL OR THE LETTER N? AND THAT THE MAGIC WORD ""ABRACADABRA"" IS ACTUALLY A NAME OF A SYRIAN GODDESS? ALL THESE AND MORE FROM L.M. BOYDS BOOK OF ODD FACTS. I POSSESS A 1979 STERLING PUBLISHING HARDCOVER FIRST EDITION OF THE BOOK THAT I TREASURE VERY MUCH. I READ AND READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AS ONE REVIEWER WROTE, ""I AIN'T GONNA SELL IT!"" HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL ANOTHER BOYD BOOK CALLED BOYD'S CURIOSITY SHOP FROM OLYMPIC HOUSE PUBLISHING, FIRST EDITION 1986, IT COULD STILL BE IN THE MARKET. VERY SIMILAR IN CONTENT. I HAVE ONE MYSELF. GOOD LUCK!!!!!"
3,Misleading description. Doesn't fit snugride 30,"In the description I read: ""Fits any Graco SnugRide infant car seat"". It went into the car quite easily and strapped in no problems. But the Graco Stylus travel system comes with a Snugride30 carseat which does not fit/lock in this base. So be aware before you buy this."
5,Easy Choice,These filters arrived quickly and were exactly as described. They fit my machine perfectly. Would purchase from this supplier again. Could not purchase locally.
4,breathing easier!,The big box home store where I purchased my Toro mower said they would have to special order my air filter for $7.99. Got 5 of them for $17.99 at Amazon and they are fine. Installed without a problem and my Toro is breathing easier!
4,Great Coaching Tool,"Winning Rugby is a fantastic Rugby coaching tool, however, there are a couple of areas that are a bit unclear. Fortunately, once the drills in question have been ""walked through"" by the reader, the point of the drill usually becomes clear enough that even a new coach can use it successfully.I have been coaching for less than one year, and this is the main resource I've used for our training. The players really liked the drills we ran from these pages.The author is obviously knowledgeable about the sport, and he writes his book without being condescending. Something I found to be quite refreshing. Mr. Quistberg seems to understand that the reader actually wants to learn something, and he makes it easy. Each drill comes with a drawing detailing the expected actions of the players, as well as commentary concerning the expected result of the drill.All in all, if I were to recommend only one resource for a new rugby coach, this would be it."
2,simple drills for a starting club or coach,"The book was well organized and the descriptions were adequate, but I found the drills much too simplistic for a skilled team or coach. Most of the drills are designed to maximize a certain aspect of play, passing for example, but don't often relate to game scenarios. Some of the drills seem to emphasize bad habits, such as running at your opponent, rather than running toward space. I would not recommend this book to a serious player or coach."
1,Not the best on this topic,"I love color. I love paint. I love decorating. This book is OK but it's one of those European imports, so the settings don't look quite right. And this book has been around awhile. I just found a new book on the subject called Painted Furniture, which is by the Better Homes and Gardens people. Painted Furniture has complete how-to, fresh color and styles, and it has settings and product lists that apply to American homes."
1,skip this book,The photos are boring and/or out dated. It does not give you very useful tips. There are other books on bathrooms that are much better such as House Beautiful Bathrooms.
5,"Platform independent, plain english, and complete - buy it.","I have read this book three times, and each I learn something new. It is nice to have a book that is independent of any development platform, and in PLAIN ENGLISH to boot. This book is more valuable than the course I had taken in college.This book is for people who want to be productive. It is not for people who like sitting in all day meetings trying to come up with the CUTEST idea.To get a straight forward answer on associative entities/relationships was like a breath of fresh air. I was told once that you should never have to use association tables. You should maintain the integrity of the database via code - yeah right.I have recommended this book to every developer I know. This book should purge your mind of every piece of useless information that anyone has ever told you on how to approach building and designing applications."
1,Damaged upon arrival,I used this product in our last house but I bought it at a big box retailer. This time I ordered from Amazon. Missing parts and every laminate corner was damaged in some way. I had to go to home depot to get the missing track. did not return because I need that closet space today to empty about 5 wardrobe boxes we have left in our childs room since the move.do not order this product online. Only buy from big box retailer.
4,The Toughest Sport,"Bill Coleman was kind of a white collar amateur boxer who set his mind on going pro... at the age of 40 ! He quit his well-paid job, put together a financial back-up plan and started promoting his dream. In other words: he sailed away from that safe harbor his life once was. Now that takes b*lls, people. Do not expect adventure & glamour. It's an honest, detailed description on the highs & lows he (en)countered in & outside the ring. (Note: The book is of the year 2007, so his 2008 fight with Thomas Dardar is not included.)"
1,Garbage book with Garbage Quality Civil War Photographs,"Most of the images in this book don't hold a candle to real quality images. All the pics in the book were purchased on ebay, published in the book, and then regurgitated back for sale on ebay..This collector? has no expertise in this field and is a joke to the real collectors out there. Absolutely a waste of time book, and the publishers should have taken their second choice book on underwater basket weaving...it would have been more interesting!"
3,Cap not as pictured,"The picture above clearly shows a metal mouthpiece cap, but the one I received is plastic. After calling customer service at the Woodwind and Brasswind (where it's shipped from), I was told the error is the manufacturers- they only make the plastic cap. Other than that, the cap is a good fit."
3,Fun Enough,"I enjoyed reading this book. It was a good story with a little action and a little romance. The ending did surprise me...I'm pretty good at reading a book and just enjoying the ride rather than trying to figure it all out. I like the Star Wars movies so the little references to characters from the movies were nice...however I think that the story could have been so much more if it was more well-developed. Also, due to the ending, I now am searcing for the sequel but can't find one which is beginning to annoy me...the ending, while interesting, left me hanging."
2,Extremely Average,"I hope this book is better if you are familiar with Star Wars Galaxies. I have never played that game, and this book seems like a glorified short story on a fan page. It is not very exciting. I hope that fans of Galaxies find more in the story that is worth reading, because for me this was a chore to finish."
3,Hum...,I'll keep this short. At first the book felt like it was just another star wars book with quick quips and refrences to SWG Online...as if the the story was written first and then someone who knew something about the actual game came in and wrote some refrences to SWG that would make the reader identify...but became actually a tad bit annoying.Though somewhat predictable the end was still a lot of fun to go through. But I guess I was most disapointed in the fact that book didn't seem fan based at all. Those of you who are advid players of SWG will see what im talking about. And it probably wasn't written with that intent in which case scrap my review. :) Overall ok.
4,Fairly interesting,"I read the reviews about this book and how negative they were but i ordered it used anyway - it was very cheap. I was surprised that it was not nearly as bad as everyone made it out to be, granted i could see the way it was going to end - it is very clearly foreshadowed. But it is nowhere near the worse Star Wars novel i have read. It takes a little to get into but still i found it to be a decent novel."
2,"Not the Best, Not the worst","I have to throw in with several other reviewers after reading Hard Contact, I was looking forward to a similar mind blowing experience. I have not ever played the game but have played many RPGs and about halfway through the book I was wishing I could equip my favorite character with weapons for the plot twist at the end anyone would know was coming. It is a fun quick read.(Thank Heavens). It is, however, almost exactly like playing a video game without the joy of actually being able to prepare or enhance your characters for what is coming."
2,A decent Star Wars book,"It's still a Star Wars book, so I won't give it 1 star. That said, the book doesn't fall in with the other books in the Expanded Universe series. It isn't particularly well written, probably because it is based off a video game."
3,A Good Book,"This was a good book but it had many flaws, for one it wasnt truly an Adult Novel, it had was barely over 300 pages but it had bigger faunt then the other Star Wars books, and it was written like the Young Jedi Knights, which is ok if they didnt try to pass it off as an Adult Novel, all in all a good book with just to many flaws to give it above a 3. (dont get me started on the coverart)"
4,Fun summer reading!,"I'd recommend anyone about to embark on a vacation to get this book. I'm not particularly into cowboy stories, but this cowboy is one hot wrangler!*He's* out to get back the ranch the family had to sell because of his mistake. *She* wants to build a retreat for her self-improvement workshops -- and to provide a home for the baby her biological clock is urging her to have ASAP, even if she has to get pregnant in a doctor's office.Our heroine, the self-improvement guru, can't stop thinking in automatic spurts of the self-help mottos she teaches. The question is: will she realize that she needs to take her own advice to heart? How can she treat our hero as a mere sperm donor when they've shared that outrageous leg-shaving session?Well-drawn characters and hot...(the well-written kind) make this a terrific ride, perfect for your summer reading."
4,works good,"very well made,should last years. if you get old hard fertilizer it will jam up but other wise works smoothly."
5,Works as Advertised,Works as advertised and does a good job once you get used to adjusting the spread rate. Very rugged and heavy duty. It should last a long time which is more than I can say for the others I have had.
3,"Decent case, fairly easy to work with","The case was simple enough to install into, the door in front gets in the way of the DVD drive often enough, the front USB ports are angled funny and unusable with many USB cables."
3,poor case despite looks,I bought this case becasue I thought it was roomy. It is pretty large on the inside but because of it's pci bracket design I can't put my tv tuner in. The round antenna connector can't fit through. It sensibly has dust filters on the front but oddly has none for the side vent. it is useless in keeping the dust out. I looked at my cpu and dust was so caked on that it caused it to overheat. I had to take my cpu heatsink out and run it under water to wash all the dust out. ugggh. the screws to mount the hdd are special so if you lose them you are out of luck with additional hdd. The antec 300 is a much better case. I'd stay away from this one.
3,No Instruction Manual,I received my SLK3000B and the instructions were not included.I think if I'd received the instructions with the case it would have rated 5 stars.
4,Great all around case.,"For the money this is one of the nicest cases i've come across (i've bought many over the years). This case features a nice shock resistant drive bay that can be pulled out the side of the case (so you don't have all of the guts of the case and motherboard in the way). Other nice features, the two 120 MM fan mounts. This is truly excellent in that you can buy high CFM fans (to move more air through the case) yet they are large enough that they spin at a lower RPM. This means WAY less noise. I have two 120mm Vantec Stealth fans in my case and you can barely hear them. Nice and cool. I'd give it a 5 but the side clips on the side cover are a bit cheap and the front door doesn't come off, also the side case ""snorkle"" is cheapo THIN plastic but it serves its purpose well. But hey...it is under $50 and i've paid a LOT more for a lesser case. Amazon shipped them (I bought 3) incredibly quickly and all three are running fine and in great shape. I'd buy them again any day."
2,Generic Kathleen Woodiwiss?,"When thinking of my favorite romantic novels,""Shanna"" and ""The Wolf and the Dove"" by Kathleen Woodiwiss will always remain at the top of my list. As much as I loved those novels I was very disappointed in this book. It was like purchasing a prescription for a brandname drug and receiving a generic version instead. The book was meant to be a Kathleen Woodiwiss but could not even supply 80% of the real thing. I find it difficult to believe Miss Woodiwiss even wrote this book. It seems more likely a less talented, novice wrote the book imitating the author's style and produced this miserable version."
3,"A bit far-fetched, even for a romance","There were portions of this book that I felt dragged on a bit...most certainly the time during which Lierin/Lenore was held captive in her Biloxi home. The mystery as to who our heroine actually turns out be is resolved rather cleverly, though a bit unbelievably. But, what the heck, don't we read romances to get away from reality anyway? And like most KEW books, this one also results in a pregnancy! LOL... Malcolm is a detestable villain, but he also seems a bit weak throughout the middle of the book. If he were as evil as he should have been, there would have been less downtime and more action against Ashton, our hero. Overall a decent book."
3,Avid reader,I am familiar with this author and find her books can be wonderful or just okay. This happened to be one that I had a hard time getting to the end.
4,"good start, bad end",I enjoyed the book until the end. The ending dialogues just seemed ridiculous. Why would Malcolm have explained everything to her? Why would Ashton have left the house unsecure? Many things bothered me. I will give Ms Woodiwiss one more try.
4,I'm very Confused...,"I thought this book wasn't bad, but I felt like I was being rushed at the end, like K.E.W. ran out of ideas and had to end the book quickly. It left me thoroughly confused. If anyone GETS this book and wants to enlighten me, let me know. E-mail me at sweets_234@hotmail.com. Yes, I was serious, very serious. I don't understand it all. Grrr. Other than that little detail, I really enjoyed everything execpt the end. The writing, as usual, was surperb, and the love scenes were great. The thing about Ashton is that he is the only male K.E.W. character in all of the books I have read that doesn't force the female character into doing something she doesn't want to. In fact, he tells her that a simple ""no"" will do. Hee Hee. I still dunno if he is my favorite. Ruark from ""Shanna"" was pretty cool. :) Anywho, all in all, it wasn't such a bad book. But, compared to ""Shanna"" and ""A Rose in Winter"" it didn't stand a chance.~Olivia~"
4,Come Love a Stranger,I really love how Kathleen E. Woodiwiss writes. She is very descriptive and you feel like you are living the story yourself.
5,You'll love this timeless story!,"Ashton Wingate, handsome plantation owner and grieving widower, is still haunted by the death of his beloved wife some three years ago. Imagine his shock, when a woman strikingly like his wife is hit by Ashton's carriage on his way home! Only one thing lies in the way of Ashton proving to everyone that this is actually his dear wife Lierin-she's lost her memory. But who is she? Is she Ashton's wife, or the wife of someone entirely different? This book is a definite must-read with finely drawn characters on many complex levels."
5,A perfect example of what a romance novel SHOULD be.,"Come Love a Stranger is one my all time favorite romances. Lierin and Ashton have a sweet, poignant love affair, you can't help but root for them to be together. The plot (a tried and true amnesia plot, with a unique spin) is interspersed with mystery and leaves you guessing. The storylines wove in and out with clues, details and still left you surprised at the end.This is by far one of Kathleen Woodiwiss' best...and one of the best romances out there."
5,I'm biased,"I'm biased, because I like just about everything Lynn Morris and her band put out. This CD is no exception, and is one of my favorites. There are a lot of different approaches people can bring to bluegrass music, but her style suits my preferences. Her voice is perfect for the music she sings. For example, I don't think I can imagine anyone doing a better cover of Hazel Dickens' ""Mama's Hand"" then the one that's on this CD. If you like female vocal bluegrass, it's likely you'll be happy with this. Some of the tracks are sung by band member Marshall Wilborn, and these are equally enjoyable.Favorite tracks (but they're all great):1. Mama's Hand2. It Rains Everywhere I Go3. Walking The Blues4. No One Has To Tell Me5. I Can Call Jesus"
3,"Introductory, not a Hacks book","This book is a good introduction, but it's not a Hacks book. The Hacks series, which I really like, is all about unique and novel approaches to tricky problems. This book is a nice introduction to Excel, but it doesn't provide particularly unique content. I'm sorry to see that since I haven't yet seen a Hacks book I didn't like. Oh well, there is a first time for everything.If you are interested in Excel introductory material you will probably like this book. If you are an experience Excel user looking for a Hacks style book with unique and cool solutions to tough problems, you won't find them here. I gave the book three stars because, even though it's not a Hacks book per se, it's still a tight and well written book on Excel that is still far superior to some of the 1000 page screenshot collection doorstops on the market."
4,great supplement,"Although there is some overlap between hacks, overall this is a great addition to an excel reference library"
1,Bellsonecor TR350 2Speed Automatic Telephone Recording System,Good price. Could not get rid of loud shrill noise.No tech support. Only option was to send it back.Bellsonecor TR350 2Speed Automatic Telephone Recording System
1,Item disgusts me.,This item doesn't work as it is supposed to.There is a LOT of noise and the only person recorded was myself.What a rip-off!!!! Seller won't answer my email.
1,Bellsonecor TR350,"The recording quality of the incoming call was very poor. Could not hear clearly - if I turned up the volume, feedback occurred. Returned it immediately."
2,Works OK for the price,This telephone recorder works OK ...but will need a lot of cassettes if you wants to record all messages. Also at low speed 90 min tapes ran slow and did not sound right. 60 min work fine. Record every instance the call is received. For the price it is acceptable product in today's high tech world. If I can afford a digital VOX recorder I will go for it next time.
4,Good pet/ferret gate,"Other reviews are right on the money for this gate. It's fairly inexpensive and not thick plastic, but it's perfect for ferrets. Mine are livid that they can no longer climb or squeeze past the gate, but I'm very happy. I'm a little worried it might not hold up over a long period of time, but I'd be glad to buy another of these as long as it lasts for a couple years.Follow-up: After several years this gate is still going strong. We are very pleased with it and would definitely buy another if we needed another."
3,Still not tall enough!,Nice gate and great idea but my 6 lb 5 month old yorkie still managed to jump it. 2 minutes and she was out!
5,Clear Gate works very well for ferrets!,This gate is sturdy and easy to install and our ferrets aren't able to find a way through/under/over it! Highly recommend!
4,"Works For Purpose, but One Was Defective","I have a new 8 month-old kitten who stands on my face at 4 AM, jumps at my feet, sticks a paw in my ear...you get the idea. I bought two of these to stack, in order to block her from the hallway leading to my bedroom. One alone isn't tall enough, and she glides easily over it. The design works well, even with baseboards (contrary to what another reviewer wrote), and aren't difficult to master. However, one of the two I ordered was incorrectly assembled and wouldn't open, so it was returned for a replacement. Once properly adjusted, it forms a solid barrier to kittens hell-bent on destroying my beauty sleep. Highly recommended, but quality may vary."
2,Difficult to use and doesn't work with baseboards,"After reading the positive reviews here, I decided to buy this gate. What a mistake! First, adjusting the width of the gate was a pain. The sliding mechanism is just not smooth. Second, opening the gate is difficult. I'm an average strength woman and I had to use two hands to unhook the metal latch. Third, I have fairly shallow baseboards and this gate did not work with them. The rubber cushions on the ends are not adjustable so if the gate is used with baseboards, the cushions are not long enough to make contact with the walls."
3,Pretty good - but I'm not thrilled,"Hi y'all. I bought this item based on the reviews, and overall, it does perform, however, I was surprised with how ""loose"" or apparently cheaply-assembled it is. It seems like if the company spent a few more cents on hardware and tightened the items on the gate, then it would be better and more sturdy. Otherwise, it's all good!"
1,waste of money,"My dog destroyed this gate in one week. The plastic panels will not hold up to the scratching of a small dog, even trimmed and filed nails tear right trough. If used for babies or animals who are happy to be contained this would probably be great."
4,Ferret blocker!,"Finally, a gate that the sneaky guy can't get thru. Once you figure out the locking system (it's a bit different)this is wonderful for keeping the small ferret out of where you don't want him to be. No holes to go thru the sides and no net to climb up and over. I will buy another one when the plastic baby gate from One step wears out that I bought 5 years ago that is now [........]. I am sure this would be great for baby too."
5,Great Baby Gate,Our 19 month old great-niece visited from Alaska and we needed to block her access to our open basement stairway. The Supergate worked great. It was high enough that she couldn't crawl over it and the clear plastic was safe for her little fingers and hands. She slapped the plastic with her hands a few times and the gate didn't budge. The gate is easy to put up and take down as needed (no tools required) and the size was perfect for our needs.
5,Ferret Proof!,"I purchased this to keep my ferrets on one side of the doorway, and the things they shouldn't have on the other. It works like a charm! None of the ferrets have come close to getting over the gate, and they have all worked very hard to test it. The cats can jump over easily and come and go at will. I highly recommend this to ferret owners. After the first use, I can set it up with one hand if need be. It is very stable as well, and doesn't leave any marks on the door frame. I wish I had bought this several years ago."
5,Just what I wanted,It is a fabulous collection of ideas for future camping trips and adventures. I enjoy all the pictures of the yummy food too.
4,alaskan wilderness cookbook,It is just the book I was looking for. I had the book yeara ago and l9ost it in a fire so I wanted another and it is currently out of print. Happy to have found it!
5,our favorite game,"combine an old favorite with the new pokemon characters and get a game that our whole family loves. we have played it at least once a month for years and it is always fun. mom, dad and boys now 6 and 8 get this game down when the electricity goes out or on a camping trip or just to be together. this is our favorite game because anyone can win even if they are behind for a while."
4,POKEMON FUN,"This is a great game if you can get your hands on it. It was produced many years ago, and hard to find. Fun version of Sorry. Just a couple of extra rules that give it it's own flair."
1,looks cheap... .,Yes! It's plastic! It looks very cheap. there's NO 'corelle' mark and the print of pattern is off center.
2,Plastic spoon rest that's nothing special,"I received this spoonrest as a free gift. The only advantage I can see about it is that it matches the other Corelle items in the Pink Trio pattern. If I had to buy one, I would opt for one in glass or pottery so I could be certain it wouldn't melt!"
5,This is a fabulous introduction to investing.,"If you're a twenty- or thirty-something looking for an accessible, useful guide to investing, look no further. This is a great how-to guide to the markets, written in an inviting yet not condescending style. Buy it. Read it. Tell your friends."
2,Not good if you have wireless internet...,While the item itself is fine what they don't tell you is it operates on the same frequency as your wireless internet. It will interfere with it if you use them at the same time. If I had known I would not have purchased it since I use only wireless internet at my home on my laptop....so it was basically a waste of our money.
3,Wireless Internet Problems,I set-up the the wireless kit today and it worked fine expect it shut-down my wireless internet each time I turned on the system. After calling Panasonic and finding out it is a known issue in their product I fixed the issue by changing the channel on my internet router. Now everything works fine. Overall seems like a good system.Panasonic SH-FX65 Pana Rear Wireless upgrade Kit for SC-PT650
5,Amazing book!,"This is actually the second copy of this book I'm buying. The first was for my own pleasure reading. The second was for my dad (for his birthday). Dennett is a great writer and I find the topic fascinating. I can't say too much about the book as a whole (because I haven't finished it yet), but I highly recommend it anyway :)"
3,Kick a rock!,"The problem is that if you take a simple animal or machine, it won't be conscious. Make it slightly more complicated and it still won't be conscious. But as you make it more and more complicated there comes a point when it becomes conscious. This idea is very unsatisfactory. What actually causes this self-awareness?Dennett overcomes the problem by arguing there is no mystery - we are simply not as conscious as we think! As the machine becomes more complicated it merely appears to be conscious, but consciousness doesn't actually mean anything. To prove this fantastic idea, he describes scientific experiments which show that consciousness is more mysterious than a layman would think. The book is worth reading for these insights, but he doesn't prove his case.I was reminded of Dr Johnson's reply when asked about the theory of solipsism (the idea that nothing exists except your own thoughts). He kicked a rock and said ""I refute it thus.""Only a very clever man could believe Dennett's theory."
3,A totally unconscious mind expained,What a joke! A desperate attempt at making the mind a computer and fitting everything into the known --- by those arragant main stream unconscious academic mind --- which is explained very clearly by this book (for which I gave it 3 stars).
4,Strutting & Fretting,"A person less sure of themself might have titled this work, A Theory of Consciousness. Not so Daniel Dennett. Here flat out he says Consciousness Explained. That alone demands you read this book if you are the least bit curious. Your curiosity will be rewarded.While the text is dense it is not ponderous. It is filled with examples, details, and descriptions. All are well reasoned and thoroughly researched. As one from the humanities with a deep interest in science, this philosophical work bridges my cognitive gap and stimulates the synapses. Or if you will, it struts and frets across my non-cartesian stage in multiple drafts.Is it explained and the issue resolved? I recommend you read Consciousness Explained and make up your own mind."
2,Too discursive by far,"I'm submitting this review even though I read only about 25% of the book. I found after that much that his style suffers from the ""philosopher's disease,"" which is to take 1000 words to explain what could be said in 200. Really, the explanations are 5 times too long! Most philosophers seem to think that extending the writing makes the point clearer, but in Dennett's case it just confuses the point. I got so tired of reading about the jumping dot phenomenon that I stopped even before I was sure I understood it. Like many well-known authors, he desperately needs a ruthless editor.I am very critical about writing, length, clarity, etc. Just read my review of ""A New Kind of Science,"" which I titled ""A New Kind of Goat Food,"" which title describes the best use the book could be put to."
5,"One emergent self says, ""Read this book!""","The outrageous title is not an exaggeration. Dennett provides the reader with abundant, detailed clinical and observational evidence that our minds don't work at all the way we think they do. He dismantles the traditional Cartesian theater (in which interpreted images are presented to the conscious mind) and gradually builds up an alternative view. The result is a model of consciousness as an ongoing series of drafts with no finished product, in which selfhood emerges through complexity, feedback and parallel processing. Dennett banishes dualism convincingly, and his writing is not only dense with new revelations, but clever and amusing. It made me laugh, it made me think. Highly recommended for conscious minds"
3,Not for the weak of mind,"This book is extremely hard to follow and the author assumes you have a huge vocabulary including Memes, Cartesian theater, etc. This is probably easier reading for some one with a masters in pychology.I agree with the 1 star reviewer that said the writing style did not carry the point across and that I felt like chapters were started in the middle of a thought with out establishing a context. I picked up a few key learnings, but what I learned could have been reduced to about 20 pages. This was VERY tedious reading and hard to finish. Pick another book on consciousness very little is explained."
2,CONSCIOUSNESS NEVER EXPLAINED,"It's rather interesting that a book whose title promises to explain consciousness never makes the attempt. Dennet thinks he has ways to think about the consciousness problem, but all he has done was to confuse the matter even more by introducing more terms and metaphors that are all too fatiguing in philosophical writings. A more fitting title, I suggest, would be CONSCIOUSNESS NEVER EXPLAINED."
3,"Good read, misses the topic","Dennett is a good writer and this book is an excellent and erudite discussion of consciousness. He is witty and he has much to say about the topic. However, the book does not explain consciousness. This is probably no surprise. After all, if consciousness wasn't such a great mystery why would one want to read Dennett's book in the first place? The book gives you a learned philosophical perspective on the topic, but it suffers from philosophitis. That is, too many words are being spent on topics like qualia, robots, the mind-body problem, self, etc. without really getting anywhere. If you like to dig into state-of-the-art neuro-scientific knowledge about consciousness, it's probably not the right book to read. But it illustrates and explains some interesting philosophical arguments. A good read, but fails to deliver what the title promises."
1,A thick waste of time,"If you look in the dictionary under ""turbid,"" you'll find a photograph of the cover of this book (to intentionally misquote Rodney Dangerfield). I have an M.A. in philosophy and a long-standing interest in this subject, but if you can learn even one thing from this book, then you're a far more perceptive reader than I. Recommended only for masochists."
2,nothing explained,"""A MAN IS GUILTY OF UNPARDONABLE ARROGANCE WHO CONCLUDES, BECAUSE AN ARGUMENT HAS ESCAPED HIS OWN INVESTIGATION, THAT THEREFORE IT DOES NOT REALLY EXIST.""--DAVID HUME. i learned a lot about contemporary philosophy of mind in america and about dennett himself by reading this book. that the former is worthless because the latter is respected. the most difficult lesson for most readers is that a contemporary reputation means nothing."
3,"Is consciousness ""special""?","Whether consciousness is ""special"" or not is a question that cannot be answered within the realms of science. Only a personal belief-system can answer this question. If scientists finally explain consciousness and illustrate that it is merely inanimate atoms that experience things, then it can only ever be a subjective issue as to whether this is ""special"" or not. From the religious perspective, science is the discovery and exploration of God's creation. Whatever science ""explains"", there will always be room for a Creator who set up the laws in the first place. It is very rational to believe that the very existence of consciousness is purposeful and valuable."
1,What?,"I'm afraid this book doesn't explain consciousness. It doesn't explain how inanimate matter can understand anything. It doesn't explain how Dennet understands anything.I was more than disappointed. Buy it by all means, but only to laugh at it with your friends. Deary me."
1,Dennett's Dangerous Idea,"First of all, this guy's book-title smacks of hubris! He is a pedant posing as a philosopher. Using sophistry to weave a web of verbal convolutions, in which consciousness manages to elude him. I've read a lot on the topic of mysticism, encompassing the last hundred years or so, relating to people from all walks of life and I have found the consistency in these personal reports more convincing than anything that Dennett has produced.I'm not going to be dogmatic, but anyone reading the material that I have read, with an open mind, feels that Dennett has missed something too suble for his logic."
3,Consciousness Avoided,"A suitable book for obtaining a general idea of the philosophical debates over consciousness. However, the title is misleading. Rather than explaining consciousness, the subject is avoided. No clear definition of consciousness is ever given; rather, the author provides a list of what consciousness is not."
4,Excelent though somewhat difficult at the beginning,"This is definitely a landmark book on the science and philosophy of consciousness. No doubt Dennett has developed a very compelling view of how the illusion of consciousness arose. I found it awkward and uphill -and somewhat unnecessary- that the author spends so much time proving wrong other people's views for the first hundred pages or so (probably to insert his arguments properly in the academic circles) before really getting into his own proposed view . As a teacher of mindfulness meditation and Buddhism with a contemporary approach, I found it very nourishing, as it helped me see more deeply into the meaning of interdependent arising, the Buddha's central teaching, especially with respect to consciousness."
2,wait for the audio CD,"Dennett is an excellent speaker, terrible writer. The only substance in the book runs from pages 101 to 227; chapters 5, 6 and 7. In these chapters he actually presents a position. The rest of the book is a history of what other people think. A huge disappointment. Not recommended."
1,Philadelphia Lawyer...,"I've tried to read this book a number of times but find Dennett both unfocused and infuriating.He uses the terms ""Stalinesque"" and ""Orwellian"" for views of processing consciousness which do not agree with his own. He writes of Mother Nature at some points as if he understands it as a simple metaphor but other times seems to be positively captivated by her charm and beauty; as if she really sits knitting the designs of the world.Dennett also doesn't seem to miss the opportunity to follow any segue, irrelevance, or story to the detriment of the point being made.This isn't even a quibble with his point of view. It's his inability to clearly write about the topic that makes the book not worth your time."
5,brilliant work,"Dennett is a brilliant scholar, and his book shows how careful analysis can go a long way towards explaining consciousness. His approach is scientific as well as philosophical, and draws on a great deal of previous research and theory to support his claims.And as for reviewers who think this book is bad because it doesn't agree with their own (often vague and uninformed) theories of consciousness: please leave your oppinions out of it. The fact is, Dennett is a legitimate scholar; he doesn't make any rediculous claims or makes assumptions without careful scrutiny. He even affirms that his theory of consciousness is not a complete theory. But what he does come up with is grounded in extensive research and empirical evidence, and the result is excellent academic writing. I highly recommend this book, and the same high level of scholarship can be found in Daniel Dennett's other works."
1,Another Reductionist Hairsplitter,"Ok, so when is he going to explain just why I experience these various brain processes as having ""qualia"". Why do I smell a rose? See a train. Yes, these are occasioned by chemical and electrical changes in the neurocircuitry...However, this does not explain why I experience a world that has qualities.Yawn,TSEAY"
4,"4 1/2 STARS, DEEP STUFF!","MIXES PHILOSOPHY WITH SCIENCES AS IT SHOULD BE, DEEP LINGO, AT TIMES OFF TOPIC TRYING TO PROVE WHAT CANT B PROVEN BUT HAS GOOD POINTS, OTHERWISE THEORY NOT DISPROVEN, ONLY SOME PARTS BUT THOSE ARE HIS CREATIONS!"
2,Looking in the wrong place,"It is scary to see some people relying on arguments from fundamentalists like Michael Behe whose conclusions are not only flawed but have nothing to do with consciousness at all. Likewise it is scary to see some people relying on arguments from fundamentalists (of the opposite extreme) like Daniel Dennet whose beliefs contradict the spiritual depths of reality. The self aware universe and the depth of Being clearly transcend spiritless matter and so contradicts Dennet's argument that our universe is spiritually ""dead"". All of life is spiritual and therefore all of life's problems are spiritually based - and spiritually solved. Which side is more in touch with the deeper nature of consciousness and the ultimate issues of Being? I believe Daniel Dennet has his ladder completely against the wrong wall."
5,Read this book!,"Here's why you should read this book whether you're sympathetic to materialist theories of mind or not: 1. It's still the best summary of recent work in philosophy of mind, neurophysiology, Artificial intelligence, and psychology, and how they come together to offer a new picture of mind. 2. It's the best critique of Cartesian assumptions ever made. 3. Whether you agree with him or not, Dennett is the most intellectually exciting philosophical writer around. His mastery of compelling thought experiments and ""intuition pumps,"" his wit and his verbal ingenuity make reading Dennett a treat, and he's at the very top of his form here. And besides, you'll learn what's wrong with Searle."
1,Very boring and obtuse,"I'm sure Dennett has some very fascinating ideas for the reader to consider, but unfortunately, they are all couched in tangential verbiage that left this reader feeling like I was suffering a fool gladly. With all the other books out there on this subject, I think Dennett's work is best reserved for a place in the ash can."
1,"Preachy, with no ending...","Though at times, the action is moving along well, and the story seems to get some heat going - its got way too many preachy interludes. Finally, after having built to a dull roar - they story ends without any resolution, without any answers - almost like someone ripped the last 50 pages out of my book! If you've not read book one in this series, the author does an OK job of catching you up enough so that you're not lost, but unless you want to wait till the final book (years down the road) - don't expect any resolution to anything. Too much obvious preaching that doesn't add anything to the story, so it sticks out badly. The ending (if you can even call it that) of this book left me so completely unfulfilled that I wish I'd never picked it up at all."
4,Take a joyful journey to a French summer home,"This book is a charming joy. The authors' successful search for a modest summer home in France will take the reader on their own dreamy journey, exploring what it would be like to live in a French country village and to succeed in making friends with the villagers. Great insights into what rural French folks are really like, and how to make them your friends. The book also underscores the importance of finding what is truly important to you in your life."
5,A CASTLE IN THE BACKYARD,"What a total delight this book is. After five years of visits to Provence, I decided on exploring the Dordogne. None of the guidebooks on the market connected me so much with an area as did this beautifully written volume by Betsy Draine and Michael Hinden. Their descriptive writing had me share their agonizing search for their dream house, slowly getting to know their neighbors, and especially their frustration of seeing the idyllic village turn into a tourist mecca. The ending came too swiftly. I could have enjoyed a few more chapters, a sort of never-ending story. Perhaps we will someday be blessed with a continuing volume."
5,a delightful read,"after watching the late news, I pick up A Castle in The Backyard as my reward after a long day. It's my escape hatch into the loveliest part of France! In my mind, I can experience life in a small French village with Michael and Betsy, visit the surrounding areas, gaze at the quietly meandering river, eat delicious meals, visit prehistoric caves and make new friends. Only after treating myself to a few chapters each night, can I go to bed happily and peacefully, just knowing that such a place exists. Whatever will I do when I finish this wonderful book? I suppose I'll just have to travel to the Dordogne myself!"
2,More like Unidapt,I hated it! It didn't even begin to fit my Moto Q and that was with a regular battery; a total waste of my money.
4,Great design but be careful when first using it with an Extended Battery,"I really like this case. I get many compliments on it!Only concern is that when I inserted the Q in it (with an Extended Battery) it tore the stitching on the front. So be gentle!!! Not the end of the world and the case continues to be very usable.Within a day, the case leather formed more appropriately around the battery and I have not had any problems with removing the Q from the case and putting it back.I might suggest the elimination of the plastic over the screen or change it to non-glare. Either way, this is still a great case!"
1,Wished I'd Read The Reviews,"I have a Krusell case for my Nokia 6620 & its great! But for the Q, I couldn't believe they left the screen unprotected. This was money wasted."
2,great packaging poor clip,"Well My Motorola Q already has a cracked screen but it is not this cases fault-it happened 2 weeks after I purchaced Q but before I put case ""on""But after I tried to get case on as best I could I found It doesnt fit well with extended battery and is difficult for others to hear me talk. Also clip doesnt work well and doesnt keep phone in any one position and the phone can actually twirl easily on clip. It is made of good quality black leather but I have gone back to the original clip that came with the Q despite the cracked screen."
4,Stunningly acurate,"I found this book in the parking garage of the Oncologist's office where I work as a Medical Technologist. It was a paperback advance copy. My first reaction was ""Why in the world would someone here want to read such a book! "" However, once I started it, I could see the hope offered in the account of David Biro's struggles with the horrors of PNH. Biro's account of the patient side of today's health care system was well written. I couldn't put it down. Being a Med. Tech., I was all too aware of the effects of chemotherapy treatments and the dire consequences of the disease. I was somewhat detached from his situation until I got closer to the end. I was moved to tears in several passages where he speaks of how all of this is affecting his wife, family and friends. I celebrate his survival as I participate in the marathon run in my area for the survivors of cancer and those who lost the fight. Congratulations, David and keep fighting!"
3,Nothing to learn?,"As a survivor of a life threatening illness, and a registered nurse, I thought I would relate to Biro's book. I was mistaken. As I read the book, which was well written, I waited for David to talk about the lessons he was learning from his illness. David never spoke of a greater appreciation for life, or the precious moments he spent with his family. He did not seem to walk away with a new found bond with his patients. Instead he pittied them more. Most people with illnesses look for the reason or lesson to be learned. Poor David. He missed out."
3,Good but not Great,"David Biro's book is a good, quick read. Biro spins a tale that in which the medical content is detailed but not too dense. Also commendable is the amout of consideration given to the his family and the personal side of his disease and treatment.The drawbacks in the book are largely literary. Biro steps above his writing ability as times and makes some really poor analogies. Biro's writing skills shine when he writes a simple, personal narrative but he often slips into his weak, higher diction.Overall the book is good, and I would recommend it too any fan of medical stories or real-life dramas."
1,smoked salmon from Kasilof,"I thought I was ordering smooked salmon. this is what they called it BUT it came in a plastic pouch in a liquid almost like canned salmon..I wanted a dry smoked product.. Icalled them about it, BUT they told me that what they sent me is they're ( smoked dry salmon ).....Well maybe I wanted ( dry smoked salmon )..I could have bought the same thing for a couple of bucks at wal-mart..I was raised in the pacific N.W. and the indians always had dry smoked salmon..Now I can't find it except for dog food...I'll never buy this product again...All I've got to say......Purchased at amazon.com"
1,Displeased with product,"As a Native American who is from Seattle, I was excited to try this well-reviewed product. It is a great disappointment. There were about 3 ounces of liquid as part of the weight for which we paid so dearly. The flavor was watery and fishy with a faintly salty hint of smokiness. Did I receive a bad batch? Whatever shall we do with the additional unopened package? It was intended as a gift... Maybe I will give it to the cats for Christmas."
1,Not what you might expect,"If you want a nice wooden display case to store old drill bits in or maybe some rocks than at best this is what your paying for.I eat Smoked Alder mackeral, Turkey and salmon from my local smoke house in Fl. and they were shut down for maint so I thought what the heck I'll give this a try & boy was I in for a shock! Nasty meily soft and smelly best describes this product. Couldnt get the smell out of the kitchen for a few hours. Dont waste your $$ might as well go to your local store and buy a can of Salmon for 2.95 and feed this glop to your cat if he'll eat it!"
3,BOOK,It's a bit outdated.I would have liked some more information on them...................The Veterinarian says they like fruit sticks to chew on...
4,For the unusual pet lover,"I love the style of book this publisher does. The pictures are great, though I'd love to see more. The information is useful and relevant. It would be a five star if there was just a little more information for those of us who like to know more. But, if you have or are considering acquiring this unusual pet, this is most of what you'll need.My personal opinion of these as pets, in case you're wondering, is not favorable for most people. If you want a great rodent pet, get a rat. Believe it or not, they are wonderful pets. They are not ""creepy"" like most people think. They are domestically bred and legal in all states (Degus are not). Degus do not like to be held and rats love to ride around on your shoulder and just see what's up. Degus food is hard to come by. If not fed properly, they easily turn diabetic. I've had hamsters, rats, degus and even an opossum. The rat is the best for kids.This book is best for general knowledge."
1,Dont buy from APEX,I bought this razor from APEX and it would not hold a charge. I emailed APEX and they would not return it for another. They instead sent me a label to send it to Remington. While I assume this is what they would have to do as a consumer I didnt feel it should be my responsibility. ANY other time I have bought a faulty product I have returned it to the place of purchase for the exchange of one that worked!! VERY disapointed!
3,Remington shaver review,i haven't been able to get it to hold a full charge maybe 10 mins. but it runs all day with the cord hooked up!!!
1,"Hike Las Vegas, but not with this book.","I tried to use this book. However, the route descriptions are poor, and the author seems to have trouble telling north from south. There are too many errors to be typos. The area has some great hiking, and the book points out some good ideas, but be sure to take your topo map and compass! I thought about selling the book on half.com, but I would feel too guilty selling it to someone with less outdoor experience than I have."
2,No comparison to Appalacian Mountain Club Guides,"As a long time hiker in the Northeast, I have used the Appalacian Mountain Club guides for years. In comparison, the trail instructions in this book are poor. I recently hiked up Bridge Mountain. I am glad I hired a guide becuase the instructions in the book were insufficient."
3,not for beginners,"I have hiked a lot in the Vegas area, and the first thing I noticed is that this book is not for first-timers! It is more useful for locating general spots to hike. It is very tough to follow the text and tiny B&W pictures to stay precisely on the trails. See if your library has a copy, or buy one used. It is worth a look and can be helpful."
2,"Great Hikes, Little Guidance","My daughter and I spent a week hiking in the Las Vegas area and bought this guide book and also ""Hiking Southern Nevada"" for help in choosing hikes that would work for the two of us, she being a young, vigorous and skilled scrambler, me a little older and slower. We found the Visitor's Center at Red Rock Canyon, their printed material, and the Ranger station at Mount Clarkston much more helpful than the guidebooks. The descriptions of the route were not helpful in keeping us oriented and the black and white photographs were confusing and at no point made the route clearer."
2,"A great book, if you're looking to get lost off trail","First, on the positive side, this is a handy book if you're simply looking for trail descriptions, but if you're looking to explore some of the ""off the beaten path"" areas, be sure to have a topo map and a compass (and you won't need this book, if you do), because if you rely on this book it will only get you one place- lost. There are descriptions such as look for ""a fallen tree, about four feet off the ground"". After an hour's hike and seeing numerous fallen trees, you begin to wonder which he is talking about. Also, can you be sure the tree he is referencing will still be there? The ""maps"" as he calls them are simply drawings and the photographs are often unclear. He sometimes gives compass points, but you must be standing where he was for them to be accurate. At best this book can be used simply as a description of the area and what sights there are to be seen. At worst, this can be a dangerous book, not to be used by the novice hiker."
1,advanced bs... not worth a dollar,"firstly, this book is historically and factually incorrect. (not always but ive found big mistakes like citing aries as a water sign? fire duh basics) anywaze also alot of DJ Conway's references are basic 101 reader works and not reference texts or nonfiction works. (she gets her references from books that i dont consider advanced.) So where is this advanced shamanism.. not here. Dj Conway changes information to fit her idea of the occult and lables it something that is historic, ancient, and obviously pre-established. This is NOT a good book. tell you what youd be better off reading a book by an archeologist and putting the peices together by your self. She does have good meditaions but this is not what it presents its self as. Straighforward, it was a waste of money."
2,"Not advanced, but a continuation of the first book","This book is not necessarily advanced but merely a continuation of the earlier book By Oak, Ash, and Thorn by the same author, with some overlap. Filled with mini glossaries, correspondances and exercises, it's only recommended if you absolutely adore the first title."
1,Fictitious Fluff,"D.J. Conway does it again. Seriously, why doesn't she just write fiction novels. It's clear that most of her ideas are fantasy backed up by more fantasy. There is almost nothing of value in this book about Celtic or shamanic anything. Conway even embarrasses respectable wiccans. I agree with another reviewer, I wish there was a 0 setting. I'm just glad I was not duped into opening my wallet for this garbage, I reviewed it in the bookstore."
5,Great Product!,"We currently had Cheers wine glasses so the Carafe was a great addition. Easy to handle, pours well. Amazon did good by having an agreement with Mikasa. Defintely purchase the carafe, and use Amazon. Nice partnership!!"
1,Not real good,This brand is very mild. It is not the real sharp imported provolone we have all come to know and love. It would probably be fine for someone that has never experienced real sharp imported provolone that you might find In NY or NJ. Not worth it!
1,Wrong product shipped,"ADORAMA has shipped wrong battery (EN-EL3e) which is not compatible with my D50. Poor service. Had to wait a couple of days and still not able to use my camera, when I needed it most."
1,I haven't received my product!,"I cannot adequately do a review because I have not received my order! It should have already arrived, but I have not heard anything about it. Please advise."
4,Battery Review,Received in a timely manner. Works really well. For some reason my last Nikon EnEl3a battery died on me.Was about one and half years old. Stopped receiving a charge. Didn't do anything out of line to cause it. I buy Nikon since I was advised by someone I respect to do so. So far it's been a great battery despite the one losing it's charge. I keep two on hand for shooting pictures. The battery works really well in the camera and have had no problems with it other than problem described. Anyone else had this problem?
1,counterfeit battery?,"I purchased an EN-EL3a nikon battery. The battery does not hood a charge and after looking at the nikon website, it appears this battery is counterfeit and is made in China, not Japan. I would not recommend purchasing from this company."
1,Disappointed,Does not with a Nikon D90. Arrived this morning. I fully charged it. It is a very tight fit for a D90 but when inserted it did not work at all. Do not buy it for use with D90.Only the shipping was good on this item.
1,Battery Never Held a Charge,"This battery is crap, and never held a charge. Do not buy from this company. I now have to find another battery. I thought it was my charger, so I bought a new charger."
3,Not Sure New,"Received the ""NEW"" Nikon EN-EL3a battery and, as I have done with other NEW batteries, placed it in the charger for the several hour initial charge to ready it for use. Much to my suprise the charger showed that the battery was fully charged. I am suspicious about the ""NEW"" battery purchase because when I received the battery the NIKON box was in rough conditon (which could be from shipping), the typical battery useage instructions were missing (NIKON provides them inside every box), and the battery was fully charged (I have not purchased one fully charged before). I used the battery at Indianapolis to shoot the 2012 Pole Day time trials and it seemed to work fine for a few hundred shots then the charge began dropping off quickly. So the bottom line, I'm suspicious about my ""NEW"" battery purchase but not enough to return it. I'll stick to purchasing them locally and paying a little more but I'll have that ""warm and fuzzy"" feeling of picking a new one up off the shelf."
1,Item poorly packaged,"This item comes to you very poorly packed with no padding (bubble wrap, peanuts, etc.) in the box. Mine looked like it had been through World War III. The enamel on the water bowl was chipped both on the inside and outside of the bowl where it had taken a blow of some sort in shipping. I had to touch it up with high-temp paint to ensure that it would not rust. The ""body"" of the smoker itself was also bent to the point where it would not fit down inside the rim of the charcoal pan like it was supposed to. I had to bend it back into a more circular shape in order for it to work. Also, the sticker on the side of the smoker that says ""Cook'n Ca'jun"" was messed up. I feel that these problems could have been avoided if the item had been packaged in a better manner. This thing costs too much to arrive at your door in this kind of condition."
4,Yummy!,"If you are into smokin' with charcoal in a small space, this is for you. This little grill is low maintenance and compact. After my divorce, I had to go get a new one because he took it with him. Yes, I'm a woman and I grill. It's easy on this one. Of course, smokin' is a long process so if you're looking for a quick dog after a ball game, heat it in the micro! This grill made THE BEST smoked pork tenderloin I have ever eaten. Use a great moppin' sauce and take the afternoon. It's worth it! I only gave it four stars because it uses charcoal instead of wood, but you can add your own hickory chips or whatever to enhance the flavors. Go for it!"
2,Keep Looking,You can find much better charcoal smokers for nearly half the price at retail outlets. Any smoker you buy should have a door or entry to add charcoal and chips during the smoking process.
1,not very good,"This product is exactly the sort of thing that will leave a bad taste in your mouth. It's shoddily made, and has a bad design. For example, it has no side door so you have to lift the entire cannister up to get into the coals. Also, they do the most obnoxious trick I've ever seen: they deliberately don't pack all the parts in the box and include a note saying to call them to get the rest of the parts... so they can get your name and numbers and put you on a mailing list. No, thanks. DOn't buy this product."
4,SMOKE THIS,"Remember, nothing is perfect. I received my smoker/grill when my father-in-law did not know how to use it(no really)! He gave it to me after only using it one time, never covered it up, had it for two years. To make a long story short, I cleaned it up, went to the local auto store, bought CHEVY ORANGE ENGINE PAINT, painted it, and have been cooking for six years. My mother-in-law said, and I quote, ""NOW THAT IS WHAT A CHICKEN IS SUPPOSE TO LOOK LIKE!"" P. S. it can smoke a mean meatloaf! LOVE IT!"
5,Beautiful!,"Beautiful! I was surprised at how small it was (my problem with visualizing space/volume tho). I love corelle. This was purchased as a gift, but I'd love one for myself."
3,"not terribly impressed, but it's still nice","I bought this not knowing how well it is made, nor what it is made of, I just wanted it to match my dinnerset. It doesn't look like the craftmanship is all that good but it is hardly noticeable. I speak of the lip. The inside is colored all black while the outside is mostly white. At the lip, at the point where in meets out, the painting is a bit uneven. Maybe I'm just nitpicking. My experience with enamel coated kitchenware is that after years of use it gets chipped. I can't imagine this would happen with a teakettle though, unless you're rough and tend to bang it around. I hope to get some good years of use with this despite the flaws I've seen."
1,JUNK!!!,This thing is a real pile of junk!!The battery is not held tight in the battery compartment. To get this too workYou half too hold the battery tight againstThe contacts with you thumb
3,Snow Unicorns,"While the club vacations at a ski resort,Ellen is stuck dating a boring guy who goes on and on about himself,like he thinks he's Christmas.When the two get stuck after an avalanche,it's all Ellen can do to stay awake.She just may end up being bored to death.Oh well,it's only Ellen.I don't like her anyway."
5,Good book,"I bought this book for my son because the school told him that he could not keep checking it out over and over. He earned it as a reward for bringing his grades up. He worked hard to get it, so I call that high praise indeed."
4,Exceptional Illustrations,I had the unusual experience of reading this book before reading the J.R.R. Tolkien novels. The exceptional illustrations more than make up for any Day/Tolkien contradictions.I highly recommend this book to fantasy art fans and to students of pen and ink.
1,Very unsatisfying,"I've owned this book for years, and never liked it. The prose is overly pretentious, and the illustrations just don't FEEL right (perhaps because they are so different in style and tone from Tolkien's own watercolors). This purports to be a reference work, but it's written as if the author would like it to replace the text. (This would be less annoying if it were better written.) Don't waste your time.Fonstad's ""Atlas of Middle Earth"" is a MUCH better (though very different) Tolkien reference."
5,"Has complete history of middle-earth, and all the characters",It had wonderful reference articles and pictures. Just like you would imagine Middle-Earth.
2,Don't expect accuracy or faithfulness to Tolkien,"David Day is one of the more imaginative Tolkien annotators ever to be published. His work is completely without merit from a scholarly point of view because he makes up his facts and includes many misleading details. He is constantly hammered by Tolkien researchers on the Internet.What he brings to the realm of Middle-earth commentary is an imaginative retelling of Tolkien's mythology. It's unique, if not legitimate. He lacks Tolkien's style and depth, but many people have enjoyed Day's books through the years despite their inaccuracy.These books make good conversationalist pieces, but the reader should beware. They won't teach you much about Tolkien's world and what little they have to offer in the way of accurate information is washed away by the unauthorized additions and changes."
3,Beautiful but beware,"David Day's Tolkien Bestiary is a lovely book, filled with color and monochrome drawings and maps. Arranged alphabetically, it makes researching races and groups of creatures fairly easy. The drawings are beautiful.The reader must keep in mind, however, that this is not a full encyclopedia of Tolkien's world. You won't find a listing for Aragorn under ""A"", for instance. Also, the descriptions of various races and animals have sometimes been enlarged from the original. This is an interesting read in itself, but do not expect this to be completely true to The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings.Most readers who pick up this book will probably already have read The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. If not, go to them first."
2,not worth your while,"There are many great reference books out there to guide fans both old and new through the intricacies of Tolkien's Middle-Earth. This is not one of them. While this book does contain a good deal of accurate information, much of the rest is either David Day's own invention or just plain wrong. The composite map at the beginning of the book scarcely even makes sense when compared to those drawn by Tolkien himself. The book is an interesting conversation starter, but it is not faithful to The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion. It gains a second star primarily because of the beauty of some of the illustrations it contains. For a true encyclopedia of Arda, search elsewhere. There are any number of other books, as well as on-line resources, that are much better researched."
3,It's not that bad...,"I'm just responding to the review in which the fellow claims the book is 'worse than useless' - I'm a hugely critical reader, in spite of which I enjoyed and found useful the entries in this book. Most entries are very close to what one might call the 'official definition.' There are a few entries that are 'richer' than the official texts provide for, but it's pretty easy to detect the 'story-teller's voice' What's more, these embellishments don't detract from the story and don't frivolously change it."
5,Do You Like Ambient Trance?,"If you do, this double album might be for you. It goes down smooth and keeps the vibe mellow. A welcome addition to my collection of chill out CDs."
2,Sleepy time....,"I am a fan of energetic, progressive trance you can dance to (ala the Zenith room at Pacha in Ibiza). I was not into this very relaxing, floating techno trance. But if that's what you're looking for, you'd probably like it."
4,well done,"My Funny Valentine is my favorite out of all of them. This album has the classic sound of Miles Davis and it's good to buy if you want to begin listening to Miles Davis. That was the case for me and now I have several Miles Davis albums. A great CD. Also reccomended: Miles Davis, Kind of Blue"
5,Excellent!,"This is one of Riders' highest-rated CDs, and I can see why. None of the Riders' CDs I already have features ""Cattle Call"", so I ordered this CD because it has it. The entire CD turned out to be more than worth the buying -- no surprise, as these guys are the best. If you've never seen them in concert and you get the chance...go! Loved every track on this one."
5,Wonderful addition,"I would firstly love to say that this series is magnificent. In Sarah's Story< you see Sarah watching Frances' love develop with Gabriel but in Frances' Story you see what really happened and what Sarah could never know.Frances is a painter and after her mother dies she has to take care of her three younger sisters. During the next ten years or so you see her struggle to keep everything together and watch Gabriel slowly seep into her heart.If you love historical fiction with a twist of romance, you will love this book. I reccomend reading these books in order and purchasing them all."
4,Second of the Quantock Hill Saga,"The four stories of the Purcell sisters are really fascinating portraits of both the period and of an unusual family. I find it intriguing to see how the events in the family's life are seen and interpreted by each of the four girls. Sarah's story is first, and presents the basic facts from the perspective of a young girl. This story, Frances's, shows us the oldest in the family, a determined young woman with amazing artistic talent. Her story is a good read on its own, and even more interesting if you have read Sarah's story first, because you fill in some of the missing pieces that young Sarah couldn't know about. You also find out what happens after Sarah's book ends. I highly recommend the whole series."
5,Great collection!,"Even though these art EDT, it is a great collection of some of Guerlain's best scents! Purchasing a set at a much lower price than what the cost would be separately is a smart way to gather a collection. Besides, the little bottles are soooo cute! Love this product! Great for travel or purse, too."
3,Contemporary Beer Neon Signs Price Guide Review,"I was extrememly happy to find this book since there seem to be very few books like this one. I am a collector of neon signs and a current price guide would certainly have been appreciated! This book needs to be updated (it was written in 1994) so that more current signs and prices would be reflected. I appreciated the pictures as identifiers, but I wish the field of items had been broader. This books scope was primarily directed toward Budweiser and Miller beer signs. I like the way the book is laid out with each beer sign having just one page that contains not only a picture of the beer sign but the description and the price as well."
1,A Farce in the making,"Mr. Fellman has done a great injustice by his work already being quoted by the anti-southern (Lee) crowd as he incorporated myths and half truths. For example the highly quoted incident of Lee worshiping with a black, never happened, real historians are aware of this old myth. He is correct Lee did hold slaves and many were subject to the justice at the time, but the incidents about the two women slaves claimed by Mr. Feldman have been proven to been falsified. The exchange between Grant and Lee while somewhat accurately reported, was not the reason for the end of prisoner exchange, I refer you to Grants own biography, it was because it gave the South the power to continue fighting. This is an embarrassment and should be listed under fiction instead of reference."
2,Michael Fellman's Lee a disappointment,"I can not agree with the conclusions that Mr. Fellman reaches about Robert E Lee. For example (p116-7), Fellman makes his case that ""intrinsic to Lee's awesome presence was his generally buried but nevertheless evident anger."" As evidence the following: One evening during a staff meeting, Lee heard a teamster beating a mule. Lee ""then shouted out in a tone that I thought would scare anyone 'What are you beating the mule for?' Not recognizing the source the teamster whined 'Is this any of you-r-r mule?' Lee finished the staff meeting. After that, one of the staffers recounts, ""I have no doubt he make good the claim to the mule... but I never heard any particulars."" For this, it seems a stretch to conclude that Lee has a problem with anger. In fact, I conclude the reverse. Chapter after chapter, on issues of race, politics, relations with the troops, etc, Fellman overreaches in this way. I found the book illogical and a disappointment."
2,what does Fellman have against Robert E Lee,"If you are looking for a book that provides illogical and unsupported arguments for the mere sake of casting a new light on the character of Robert E Lee, this is the book for you. I know very little about Lee, but I do understand the importance of presenting arguments and backing them up with facts. He seems to OVERANALYZE every letter Lee ever wrote. His arguments are poorly supported. His research seemed thorough, but his conclusions are wholly illogical and without any hint of factual support."
1,Greatly Disappointing,"It is quite evident thoughout this book that the author does not like the man that he is writing about. This book was a great dissappointment. When I bought this book and started reading it I thought that I was going to learn about what led up to making Robert E. Lee the leader that he was. What I got when I finished the book was an over-analysis of a man, and it was clear that the author had no understanding of the times in which the man lived. One should not psychoanalyze out of context. Traits that are criticized and dewlt upon were characteristic of most men of the time. This author presents history judged by his standards and his belief system one hundred and fifty years beyond when the subject of this book lived. Conclusions were drawn from direct quotations and letters, but these all seemed out of context of the times without historical perspective.There are many better books about Robert E. Lee; don't waste your time reading this one!"
1,Revisionist and interpretative history,"I was hoping for a realistic and objective biography about Gen. Robert E. Lee, and instead, got a tome riddled with the author's revisionist views and personal interpretations. The life and letters of the South's most venerated hero can speak for themselves and it would have behooved the author to let them do so. The book reads as though author Fellman was hard-pressed to come up with any disparaging new information about Lee, so felt he had to insert his own judgements. A bland and sorry effort."
1,Garbage,"In a few words, this film has no direction, no resolution, and no credible information. It seeks to investigate (or bring to light) the disappearance of some kids 30-40 years ago but it draws no conclusions and it offers no explanations.This is a fantastic movie for people that like ""documentaries"" that explain a story they've never heard about, examine the character of a man they don't care about, and abruptly end with a shrug and a ""i dunno, you decide"". For the rest of you, best to just move along..."
1,Crap movie - VERY BORING,"The movie is boring and is nothing more than a hour and a half of people stomping around the woods and posing rhetorical questions at the interviewer and each other. The fact is that this guy may or MAY NOT be the killer. He was convicted of a crime with no evidence to support that he did anything except drool and look crazy on camera. I mean it looks like the media and the cops wanted a crazed killer, they found this jackass in the woods and built a case to fit except they forgot to supply motive, weapons and bodies. The movie itself is a piece of trash that I kept waiting to develop into something. A mystery, suspense, horror, something... It documents nothing, entertains noone and is so bad I found myself skipping forward until I got to the end and deleted it from my watchlist. This is crap."
1,boring,Wish I could get my money back for this. From the description I thought this would be movie/fiction. It turned out to be a really boring documentary.
1,SO BORING!,"Just terrible, interesting idea, ZERO payoff, I mean nothing. Not sure why it was even released. Answers nothing, builds no suspense. Dumb."
2,Just News,"This is more of a news story. While it is very sad and tragic that these children died and are still missing, the saddest thing is that if there is no concrete proof that this man is guilty then the REAL killer is still out there and could kill again. I don't know if Rand did this or not. But what if he really was just a scapegoat? That is the bad thing about the lynch mob mentality. Would you really rather have just someone behind bars for this or would you like to make sure the real perp has been caught?"
2,Boo!,"Not at all what I expected. It's basically a documentary not a thriller or horror movie. While the subject matter is horrible because the murder of children ALWAYS is, it's just not anything like I thought going by the description. If it had been listed as a documentary, I would have been prepared."
3,OK,"It was entertaining as we watched it, but didnt really leave a lasting impression. I love this kind of true urban legend stuff and would like to watch more good ones if anybody has good recommendations."
2,Ehhh....,"It would have been easier to watch if the stream didn't keep rebuffering. I was highly disappointed that it would stop and reload every 3 minutes, couldn't watch the entire program."
3,Wasn't everything I expected.,"The title should really be _Evolutionary Wars: The Billion Generation Battle.._. The book is a description of various defenses and offenses animals have developed through evolution to aid them in the great natural selection. However, he didn't go into as much detail as I'd hoped for about those specific defenses/offenses, and exactly what species they have possibly made obsolete. It was more of a listing it seemed. Snakes have venom. That is cool. Salamanders can change color. That is cool."
4,They work,"At a price about 1/3 of the chain stores, this item fits the bill. No fancy colors, just a good, solid wire set."
5,bellisimo!,"I consider Dolce & Gabbana to be among the very best designers of our time- very much in the same class as the late Gianni Versace, a fellow Italian designer.The photography in this book is very, very good most of the time. My favorite pictures are from a Fall 1995 ad campaign that featured my favorite, Linda Evangelista. Here she is, with her trademark Sassoon angled bob, one of her best looks ever. Another favorite set are of Nadja Auermann and Kate Moss, from a 1992 campaign. So over the top!Also included are some celebrities, like Demi Moore and Madonna, who had D&G design her Girlie Show costumes.You don't have to be a fashionista to appreciate this folio. I think this book would look great on ANYONE's coffee table."
1,Keep Looking,The ball valve is too small and restricts the flow. The lever is also too small and both are plastic. The spray pattern is uneven. I'm sending mine back!
4,Decent,"Not the greatest in the world but serviceable. Nice long jet of water, item would be better off with stronger water pressure. Nice rubber casing, switch is not very difficult to turn on and off. When changing to different streams of water none of the others(exempting the strong jet of water) are very good. the spray is more of a guzzle type flow rather than a fine mist...good for cleaning the undeside of my truck I guess."
1,spray is weak,"worst than a two dollar one at walmart. thought it looks nice, feels heavy, expect it to be high quality stuff, but turns out it gives a really weak spray...can't even reach the plants that are 5 feet away...don't waste your money; I ended up going to walmart and got a 2 dollar one, works way better than this"
2,Don't try to put out a Fire with this.,"This nozzle has a very limited water flow output. You would have to be very close to a fire to use this nozzle.There is no ""Spray"", just a dispersed flow. The focused jet setting is weak. Next time I am in Walmart I will buy another $1.97 nozzle in the car department to replace this. That one gives much more pressure and more variations in spray to jet, it just doesn't hold up in 10 degree temperature with water in it."
4,Water Hose Nozzle (Carrand),"Product arrived fast. So far no complain. I think the design will help eliminate parts chipping overtime, with the exception of the yellow off/on switch. We'll see.."
5,Best Hose Nozzle,This is the best hose nozzle ever -- I bought one then 4 for for other family members. Easy to operate and close to perfect.
5,Grrrrreat,"Best Nozzle I have found. Great for washing the car. Hosing down the driveway. Strong, durable, and doesn't break. I look to get many years from this nozzle."
1,Defective Workmanship,"Overall it looked very nice when we opened it. However, it had several scratches and nicks. Also in spots, it looked as though there was no stain or finish applied -the bare ""Wood"" showed through. So we ordered a replacement which had the same problems. Since it does not seem possible that we just got two lemons; we have returned both and will not order a Powell product again. I am also disappointed that since we returned one defective item, no one checked the second before it was shipped."
5,Awesome!,Love this coat rack. Looks like it was much more expensive! I also had a scratch on pole and contacted company and they sent me a new pole within a matter of days! The company is amazing to work with. I would definitely recommend purchasing furniture from this Seller in the future!!! A+++
3,A little shaky,"Overall we are very pleased with this product. It looks great and does the job, however, it is a little shaky once put together and does not stay as tight as it should. Nothing a little wood glue won't fix. I would buy again even knowing this."
3,Loose parts and no no customer service,"The coat rack is lovely, but the leg dovetails do not dovetail, making the rack wobble. I notified Powell, and I received replacement parts the same as the first. Wobbly. I emailed customer service, but received no response. I emailed again three weeks later, but no response as of now, two weeks from my second request. I wish I had paid attention to the earlier review which mentioned ill-fitting parts. I can add to that: no service from customer service. No more Powell products for me."
5,AB Switch,"This is the perfect item to ""toogle"" between one feed and another. A simple push of the button makes that happen. Solidly built construction indicates it will hold up for years to come. Very satisfied and reasonably priced."
1,Junk,"Product is labeled a ""High Isolation"" switch. I interpret that to mean both the conductor and the shield get switched, so that device ""A"" and device ""B"" are ""highly isolated"" from one another. Not the case. The shield is common, so if you plan to use this for switching digital signals, forget it. It is well built, though. I almost hated to throw it in the trash the day after I received it. Lost all the way around on this purchase."
3,It's not Nerf or air-soft somewhere in between.,OK so here is some info on the guns and ammo : the gun is light but tough the ammo is smaller than i though it would be but bigger than air soft ammo (about three times the size) it shoot about 35 40 feet ! not bad for a 10$ toy gun that's not Nerf=-) there are no screws in the main body(it's glued together) but the Handel has one screw. holds 8 rounds the barrel dose not come out or drop. ten dollar is a little high for this gun more like 3.99$ or if it came with ammo( which it dose not come with ammo) 6.99$: ALL AROUND Its OK (3 out of 5 stars)!! now its time for a paint job
1,Thought it was airsoft gun,"My son wanted this gun, thinking it was an airsoft gun. It is not, it shoots rubber bullets which were not included. With the cost of shipping it just wasnt worth sending back. Bummer."
5,44 magnum,"The 44 magnum is excellent. I can't speak on durability but it made it thru Christmas day. It shoots soft rubber bullets that will fly as far as 60 feet or so. From 10 feet, the bullets will hit a wall and bounce back almost as far. They load easy. I expect you wouldn't want to give it to a kid younger than 8 or so. I don't think the bullets would hurt if fired from close range but you wouldn't want to hit someone in the face. For the price I think it's excellent. Even if the bullet shooting capacity breaks the gun is still cool."
5,Well made,It shoots well and has survived my 2 boys using it almost daily. The gun is also pretty accurate and shoots a pretty good distance
5,toy gun,"I read the reviews on this gun and bought one for my 11 year old grandson, also bought extra bullets, he lives in Florida so I have not seen the gun but have been told it is the hit down there, he LOVES it and so does his friends."
4,Excellent bunch of quotes - not just for matrtial artists,"There are a ton of really inspirational quotes in here. I am a salesperson (and I have practiced tae kwon do for 2 years), and I find the quotes in this book good for both endeavors.The book is well organized and just the right size for travel. I find it fun just to leaf through it. I just bought a copy for my son as well who has just started tae kwon do. I hope that he'll find something in there that will keep him training."
2,Disappointing,"This was quite possibly one of the driest compilations of quotations I have found. Any martial artist can easily surf the net in the very short time it takes to read this book and compile significantly more motivational and inspriational quotes than Moore provides. Simply, this book is a short compilation of mediocre quotes that left me disappointed at the content and irritated by the poor editing (i.e. one particular quote by Vince Lombardi appeared twice in the same chapter ""Character"" separated by only one page.) As short as this book is and with the large spaces between quotations, it is perhaps better suited as blog on Moore's website. Joke's on me...I bought it."
2,MOTOROLA HS850 BLUETOOTH HEADSET,"I was very disapointed in this product. The blue light blinks brightly most of the time and according to Motorola it can not be shut off, how about sending us a sticker to cover it up? The volume isn't loud enough, not as loud as their older models. The noise cancelling works better but not that much better. I am not happy with this product and Motorola was less than helpful when I contacted them."
1,not happy at all,"This headset has a rubber ridge that creates a bit of a cup for your ear. After a few minutes, I found this extremely uncomfortable. I would not recommend this headset to anyone."
3,Something's changed ~ doesn't work as well as before,"I had this headset before and had lost it, so I had to purchase a replacement. Got it in time. Easy transaction, quick delivery by seller. But I'm not happy with this product because the sound quality and the reception and just overall performance isn't the same as the original one I purchased a few years back. With this unit ppl I'm talking to can hear background noise, so they can't hear me as well, and it's harder for me to hear them too, whereas my older one was crystal clear. I hardly use it and resort to a wired earpiece or put use my speakerphone, because the qulaity on this bluetooth headset is so poor. Has the quality of manufacturing diminished, or is it a counterfeit piece, or is it just an old product that's been sitting in a warehouse forever and the unit's deteriorated??? Don't know. Plus I was really surprised the product didn't come in a box. I rec'd it in a plastic ziplock baggie."
4,HS850 Bluetooth,"Easy to set up! Pairs with my Motorola L7 no problem. Love that it closes to turn off and save the battery. Earlier Motorola bluetooths used the mini USB connector to charge, so you can not use your spare UBS cables for this one. Sound and clarity good and very light on your ear. Great price!"
4,Bluetooth Headset,"Works great, good sound, just bigger than my HS500 and bounces around my ear when I move."
2,Not original bag from Eureka,"Bought this expecting same item as in photo and description, but different brand was sent, just fyi...Did not bother to return since only placed 1 order"
5,Works!,"This is the exact factory bag for small Eureka vacuums. You can buy cheaper generic bags, but this one is sturdy and easy to install and remove."
5,Another fine book from Anne George,"I couldnt wait to get started on this, the latest paperback Southern Sisters mystery! And once again I couldnt put it down. I was reading, and giggling in the bathroom, the kitchen and on the bus to work! I love the sleuth sisters Patricia Anne and Mary Alice. Throw in the wonderful Fred and Woofer and you have another lighthearted getaway..this time to Destin Florida where our two heros get involved in another murder mystery (or two). I can hardly wait until my order for the three Anne George books I havent read comes in!"
5,Pleasant Easy Reading.,"Completely enjoyable easy read. It was lighthearted, and just what I needed while convalescing. I fell in love with these sisters, and became quite sad when I realized that the author has died. I did read the whole series, and recommend them."
5,Warm and wacky,"You can't go wrong with the warm and wacky books by Anne George. These are easy reads that supply the mystery, the family (the sisters) interactions which are true to life. You will enjoy. I'm just so sorry that with the passing of Anne George, there will be no more Southern Sisters."
5,Southern Charm,Just loved being involved in the two sisters lives. The whole series is a joy and exciting also. I am so sad to have finished the series and that there will be no more.
4,This is a great mix of humor and suspense!,"This is the first of many Anne George books I hope to read! It was a humorous and clever mystery about the two southern sisters who are more different than alike. They take you on a fun, exciting, and dangerous vacation that will keep you guessing until the end! This is a wonderful book!"
4,"Good Quality, good price, small hat","The outfit arrived quickly and I was very pleased with the quality of the overalls. They are well made and look great on my son. I actually ordered this specific set as the train conductor's part of my son's Halloween costume because it came with a matching hat that looked like it would be perfect.(My husband made an awesome Thomas the Train out of a box that my son could wear with suspenders to hold the box on my son's shoulders). I figured it would also serve as an outfit later on. I was very disappointed with the hat that came with it, however. It was too small for my son to wear and the costume just wasn't as cute as it could have been. I was surprised that the hat was too small because my son is 2 1/2 years old and the outfit was a 4T (My son is extremely tall for his age)."
4,bigger then the size suggests,bought 3T and the the pants look much bigger than 3T. but I much prefer if the close are bigger rather than smaller. good quality.
4,"Very dense, great cover for the little ones","I got this plant some time ago, and at first I did not care for it. It's dense and clumps together, which helps it look more real, but it doesn't flow in the water current very well. I ended up putting it in my Jack Dempsey breeding tank. I buried the bottom and folded the top over this large rock in my tank and made a dense plant bed. needless to say, the fry that have hatched love it. I would think it would also provide great cover for other small fish. So if you need a plant for this purpose, look no further. If you are looking for a large plant to flow in the current, try the bamboo."
1,To many pictures,"Thought I would get this book to learn some drills and get a few good ideas on implementing these formations. To be honest it is way to basic, over 3/4 of the pages are whole page diagrams showing basically where A passes to B.Would not recommend it at all!"
4,Slide Heaven,"A master of the slide guitar, and this album shows the nuances he's capable of. The vocals are great and the licks are fantastic."
1,Not up-to-date,Beware! This manual stops at 2001 and does not include any information on the new Duratec 2.0 or 2.3L DOHC engines nor PZEF details.
3,Not exactly for a novice,"This suffers from what affects many guides written by experts - it's an excellent resource if you're also an expert. Which, admittedly, I am not. This manual can be a bit intimidating if you are just getting into cars. There is a lot of information, but it is very compacted. If you already know what you're doing, this would probably provide a very nice review of the important points. But if you don't, explanations are a bit unsettlingly brief. I had to supplement myself with lots of googling to be comfortable with the procedures.Also, I am firm in my conviction that any book meant to be used in a shop should be published on reinforced pages in a spiral-bound form. This book is not."
2,It's no looking for,"It's manual focus don't have the Duratec 2.0 engine only have the Zetec engine, don't work for me."
3,"Good sound quality, but a little short",Ordered these strings about two weeks ago. Love the sound they make but they did not put on the info page that they are for short scale basses. I have a schecter 5 string and the b string was almost a half an inch too short. I can still play with it but there is quite a bit of fret buzz. The other strings are all a little short too. I am hoping once they stretch out I can tighten them a little. Overall a good buy.
1,not worth buying,The quality of this product is very poor. Specially the clips that are supposed to hold this gaget on your car air vent. it streches after a few uses and fall off when the car is in motion
3,"Not a Classic, but Still Good","Novelist Sydney Sanders is invited to a party by one of her fans. Little does she know the love of her life, a woman no less, is waiting there for her. That woman is L.C. Hackett, a rock star who hasn't won a grammy in several years and is trying to get back on top. This reader enjoyed the story, but won't spend the time to read it again. The romance was great and most of us would love to have a relationship like theirs, but nothing really happened in the book. Sure, there were angst and issues surrounding making two lives one, but the story was bland and unexciting. It almost seemed like a ""day in the life"" of these two women instead of an exciting new relationship.Recommended for when you're in a melancholy mood and don't have anything better to do... accompanied with a cold beer and a bag of chips. This one only takes a few hours from start to finish."
5,Opposites Attract for sparks and romance,The Rock and Roll storyline drew me in immediately. The characters are very likeable and developed. I couldnt put the book down and just wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen next.
5,These trucks are great!,I bought this truck for my nephews and the loved it! The entire vacation they were playing with them!! I recommend it!
4,It's a shame,X used to be an ill hiphop influence. Now he rolls with the money and the fame X-TRA LARGE. If you miss real hiphop before the days of selling out get this record. Go out and support all your once dope emcees.
5,Paparazzi,"Xzibit's song paparazzi is one that i have listened to over and over and over again until ...... Wait a tick... I'm still listening to it! Anyway this song is very well rapped and written, all you need to do is buy it."
4,Where is the Pilot Episode?,"I love The Unit. I love this first season on dvd, but I want to know why the Pilot episode is not included? Love the set! Sad there's no pilot, I remember some of that episode from when it first aired and was looking for it when I watched the season."
5,"""The Unit"" will surprise you","First allow me to say that I am not into ""shoot-em-up"" movies or shows, that I do not own a TV, and that I am not male.Now allow me to say that ""The Unit"" is an amazing show. If you liked the TV series ""La Femme Nikita"" or if you liked the ""Bourne Identity/Bourne Supremacy"" movies, this series is for you.The casting is amazing and the story lines are not formulaic or gimmick-ridden. The violence, while ""real"", is not gratuitous. The characters are tough, smart, and scrappy.I wish there were more special features included..."
4,The Unit-The Complete First Season,Love the show! Sad it is off the air due to disagreement between producer and FOX.
5,One of the best military series,The unit is just one of the best action series i have watched and i strongly recommend it to everyone.
5,An unexpected pleasure,"When this show began on television, I didn't even try it. It just didn't look like something that would catch our interest. Boy, was I wrong! A friend suggested we try it and we absolutely loved it! The missions that the soldiers execute are gripping and the stories of the loved ones back home are equally interesting. We binge-watched through this season and then started looking for season 2. If you have any interest in Special Ops, you'll love this!"
5,Best Show In Its Genre,I never even watched this show until I viewed the complete season on DVD. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The Unit is by far the finest show in this genre. Anyone who likes this sort of program will not be disappointed.
4,Creative and different action series,"Really good and entertaining action, based loosely on our Delta Force.One of the best parts is being realistic enough to show that even for the most highly trained and patriotic operators, bad stuff can and probably will happen (e.g. our SEALS in Panama). But these guys can handle it.The only really negative part is the terminally boring backstories about the dependent wives at home. But that's why God put fast forward buttons on our remotes. And it looks like the producers got the message relatively early on because after the first few episodes they drastically improved the backstories. But I'm still glad to have my fast forward button."
5,mrscop,This is something that both my husband and I love to watch. We can't wait until season comes to DVD.
5,The unit,"This was delivered very quickly and packaged very securely. The DVDs themselves were of excellent quality. The episodes were all they were advertised to be: exciting, unpredictable, and of great plot lines. It makes you want for more............"
4,Very nice if you like this kind of shows.,"Don't stop at the first episode. I found it horrible and decided to stop there. A friend of mine told me to have a look at the second one before making up my mind.After the second one I got hooked. It's an excellent show. There's a ballance between the life of the guys when dispatched and the life of their wifes at home. Don't get me wrong is purely action, no deep meanings or psychological talks. But fun to watch."
4,The Unit - Season 1,"Due to my mistake I purchased this DVD believing that I would be able to view it on my DVD Player which wasn't the case due to Region Codes. Apart from that I received the products quickly, they were cheap in comparision to prices in Australia and are of good quality."
5,"Excellent, a must see show","I thoroughly loved this show in its first and second season. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in action, mystery, or just a good story with twists and turns. I can't wait until the second season comes out!"
4,The Unit is almost perfect,"The Amazon.com editorial review hit it on the head. I am a woman, and I love this show. It is exciting, interesting, and thought-provoking; but the wives' storyline is just painful.I believe that it's due to a combination of poor writing for the women's characters and bad acting. Most notably bad is the one having an affair with the colonel (can't think of her name, that's how forgettable she is). The actress playing Molly Blane, who is normally good, is horrible in this role. The best acting performance is for Mrs. Brown, but she needs to have better scripts.The most interesting parts are those when the men are on their missions. The male performers are all very good actors. If I were the writers, I would get rid of the colonel's mistress and Molly Blane characters; and replace them with better actresses. And give Mrs. Brown better material to work with. If they do this, it can become a 5-star classic."
5,Great series!,"I bought this DVD as a gift for a friend couple. We shared our love of ""24"" series for so long and I knew ""The Unit"" would also be something that we could share the same way. Unfortunately, they never saw the show, so I decided to get the first season for them as a Christmas gift, just to hook them up! I have no doubt that after they finish this DVD, they will go for the next ones! I loved this show so much that I have seen the entire series so many many times. I can't wait for them to finish watching it, so we can talk about it. IT WAS A DISASTER FOR ME WHEN THEY CANCELLED THE SHOW. I am still hoping that they start it again!"
1,Some of the worst acting I have seen in many a year.,"This series is about a special secret unit of the US Army which carries out missions both in the US and abroad. It is also about the wives of the soldiers and the lives they live and the secrets the know. Are these soldiers supermen? they are all fluent in many languages as well as being skilled killers, electronic experts etc. If so how come none of them are officers? Are they patriots misused and underpaid by the US government?The problem is who cares? The stories are predictable, poorly written and with some of the worst acting I have seen in many a year.After so many great American drama series in recent years, The Wire, The Shield, The Sopranos, The West Wing, Madmen etc how on earth did this tripe get picked up?Avoid.T"
1,A disappointment!,"Bought this first season because of the Shawn Ryan/Mamet connection. Was hoping for another 'The Shield'. Unfortunately this was not it. Standard story line of the righteous and noble American going to other countries to fight the evil,....well, everybody else.I suppose for some the angle of the wives taking care of the home and kids while the husbands are off saving the world might seem to some unique and creative, but they just come off as kind of weird and creepy. Sort of like 'The Stepford Wives' meets 'Delta Force'.Unrealistic and ludicrously ultra patriotic. Only for North American consumption."
1,This is INSULTINGLY bad. AWFUL!,"Figured with a cast like this, and such an amazingly flexible premise, that this would be impossible to screw up. Well, they did. This is simply the most terrible depiction of counter-terrorism units I have EVER seen. As someone who is close to the clandestine community of operators, this is just SO FAR OFF TARGET that I was driven to hand-write a letter of repulsion. Everything from the unrealistic dialogue to the inclusion of over-fictionalized ""heroes"" with the judgment of retarded monkeys... This is INSULTINGLY bad, and I was very discouraged to see not just a SINGLE good amazon review, but multiple. Sad. Anyone who likes REALISM, DO NOT BUY/WATCH/CONSIDER this DVD. Worst.... show... EVER."
4,Something both of us can watch.,Both my husband and I like this series. Something we will both watch together. Good story lines. Great action.
5,One of the best shows on TV,"If you're tired of watching crappy shows on TV, you need to watch THE UNIT! It's a great show that will leave you glued to your TV set. I'm always at the edge of my seet when the team gets assigned to another secret mission and they take care of business without a care in the world. This is one purchase that I don't regret."
1,LAMOMOF3,"This book repeated the same useless information that I have read a hundred times. Just, basically, let your child train themself, even if they are four years old. Nothing interesting, thought-provoking, or even particularly helpful here. If you want to THINK about training, or be educated about it, I have read several MUCH better books."
4,Great and Easy Read,Great suggestions and ideas to keep in mind during and before the training process.I love this author and other books she writes! Quick reference and quick read.
4,"Good Book, with excellent Tips","What makes this book good, is her reassuring and calming nature. She reiterates over and over, be calm, they will get it. I loved the suggestions- make up songs, read, if they get bored try another tool to keep their attention. I liked that she doesn't give timelines or make you feel like a failure. It's not a lot of hype or get dry quick schemes. I needed the book more for me than my little one."
2,Not Impressed,"I was not impressed with this book AT ALL. Having done some reading on the subject already, I felt it had nothing new to offer that was not already given in free articles or short chapters in general parenting books. I typically enjoy Elizabeth Pantley's books and articles and found this one a disappointment. I didn't expect a ""magic bullet"" approach, as that's not her style, but at least a few fresh ideas or new perspectives would have been nice."
2,I feel like a dork for buying this,"This book is so ridiculously basic and repetitive that I am embarassed to have spent money on it. Aside from the section on child proofing, which was helpful, the rest of the book is: (1) don't rush it; (2) let your child feel wet; (3) go to the potty a lot; and (4) try to make going to the potty fun. Erm..... if you need someone to help you decide where in the house you should place your potty, then this is the book for you. Mostly, it just confirmed what I already knew-- I should just follow my gut instincts and see how it goes."
5,Helped me with my stubborn potty trainee!,"My daughter was determined not to potty train! One of those who seemed happy in diapers all of her life! :)With the help of this book, we had our daughter potty trained without fuss and battles within 1 week!I love the support and encouragement Elizabeth Pantley provides, it feels like you have your support team right next to you! A great and easy read to help with potty training!"
4,Great tips,"Love this book, and author. I loved all her no-cry books and this one is the same. Found the book useful, some of the info was duplicative of what I had already read in other books, but some of the tips were new and worked. Very satisfied, highly recommend."
1,didn't work for us,"hello.although i love all other books from E.Pantley I must say this book didn't work for us.it's not only this book but many more books that suggest waiting with potty training till kids show sighs of ""readiness"".well in our case we've been waiting till my son got too old and too stubborn to do anything with pottytrainig.we've been trying and he is almost 4 and not potty trained. he rather ""holds"" and is getting commnon problems with constipation than going to the potty.i think we should start much sooner and teach children to potty the same way we teach them anything else; eating, sleeping, routine...if i may suggest don't wait till it's too late and you end up with twice as much work with potty training than when you rather start sooner. i wish i should have listened to my mom about it"
3,seems to get worse every year,"I don't know what is going on with the Pushcart series. It used to be such a valuable volume to read, but lately it gets weaker with every passing year. I'm not going to even talk about the poetry contained within. None of it is worth mentioning. And in their prose there are only four pieces that are really good. Sit down with this volume at your book store or library and just read them, don't purchase this book.Mark Ray Lewis ""Scorduatura"" (fiction)Cornelia Nixon ""Lunch at teh Blacksmith"" (fiction)Jeffrey A. Lockwood ""To Be Honest"" (memoir)Bradford Morrow ""Amazing Grace"" (fiction--though it has a weak ending)"
2,not bad at all,"This book is very good, but not for this topic. I'm really disappointed from this brand of sience."
2,This is not the best example of crosstitch books available.,"slsdaniel1@aol.com from Dallas, Texas, 07/12/98 This is not the best example of crosstitch books available. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book as it pales alongside most others currently available. The execution of the charts is not particularly expert and the subject matter is often trite. Even though blue and white is my favorite color scheme, I could find nothing in this book that merited hours of toil with the needle and thread. Perhaps you might disagree with me, but do not buy this book sight unseen."
4,One of the finest mature graphic novels available,"Milo Manara provides a story that explores several levels of relationships, trust, domination, exhibition, and voyerism. It's fast paced and has a great ending."
5,A Great Season for A Great TV Show,"Once again, the detectives do the investigating and the prosecutor's office seeks justice. An excellent combination of detective work and the legal process!!!"
3,"I paid for the full package, not 90% of it","After reading all seventeen of the reveiws, I find it odd that not a single person has noticed this dvd set's crucial flaw: the episodes you see are not the episodes that were first shown on TV. Instead, they are the episodes that were shown as re-runs, which means that some of the original content is not there any more.At least two of the episodes have missing scenes. ""Patient Zero"" is missing a crucial moment when it is discovered that the defendant's wife wanted the victim dead. And Dectective Briscoe's last episode, ""C.O.D"", is missing the part where Green hands Briscoe a characture drawing of himself.These are the only ones I noticed, but there might be more. I enjoyed this dvd set, but I paid to get all of the original content, not 90% of it. Am I the only ones who noticed this?"
4,"Ignore JohnQ, this is a great series","Reviewers like John Q. Public ""vhspreowner"" annoy me. Here's a person that obviously doesn't care about what he's reviewing, he just wants to trash anything popular. Don't beleive me? Look at his reviews. The guy doesn't like anything.I, however, do like things. Many things. I include among them the Law & Order franchise. This season was released as a tribute to Jerry Orbach, as it was his last season playing Lennie Briscoe. Sadly, it turned out to be a tribute to Jerry as well, as he died shortly after leaving the show. Over the course of almost 11 seasons, Jerry became the man people thought of when you said ""New York Detective."" Dennis Franz was close as Andy Sipowicz on NYPD Blue, but Jerry was king. The man made the performances of those around him better just by being there in the scene."
2,padded decliner,"This series rose to a peak, then slowly dissolved and descended. By this season's advent, most of the show's original energy and import had dulled into a bland formula with limited emotional appeal. Dialogue frequently seems read from a teleprompter.Since I doubt that excessive clamoring for earlier seasons' releases will prove effectual, I protest their delay by way of dismissing this season's mediocrity and lost charm. Though year 14 is not completely without merit--hence two stars and not one--I cannot recommend this season in comparison with past efforts by better ensembles."
4,Anyone Remember High-Definition?,"I am a late-to-the-series Law & Order fan - have religiously watched every new episode since 2001, and every rerun I can catch on TNT and USA, have bought every DVD available. Was disappointed when Universal decided to skip the intervening years and release season 14 instead of season 3, but knew I'd buy it anyway. The biggest disappointment was this: NBC began showing Law & Order in High-Definition (16:9 aspect ratio) last year, only the DVD series doesn't have it. Will they produce a special 16:9 version? Can't tell. Was suckered in to this one when I'd much prefer widescreen. Lame bastids. Between that and the ""we won't let you fast-forward the Universal intro and the FBI warning"", this DVD set doesn't get 5 stars. Let's face it - the FBI/Interpol warning is going to stop absolutely NO ONE, and the Universal intro is boring. If I've bought the stupid thing, I DON'T CARE."
3,"14th season okay, but too new","NBC is still showing several 14th season shows to the point that it won't make sense for me to buy this item. Perhaps if it were like season one and two which are older and less remembered. I wish they would keep releasing them in order, number 3 was to be next. I also wish they would only put three episodes on a disc rather than side. I liked being able to display Season one open for all to see the 7 discs inside. How do you display a double sided DVD? I hope Universal reads this or is forwarded this information by Amazon."
3,Kept me interested from front to back! Awesome,"I read this book at the suggestion of a close friend and loved it! Robin Cook kept me interested in each of the characters from start to finish. Although close to the end I started to figure out what the medical clinic was doing and why Mrs. Zeigler had killed herself. There were still alot of surprises toward the end, and like I said it was exciting and interesting from start to finish."
2,A travelogue masquerading as a medical thriller,"This is another one of Robin Cook's travelogues; as in ""Sphinx"" and ""Seizure,"" he sends characters on wild goose chases to exotic locales. ""Vital Signs"" details Marissa Blumenthal's globetrotting to the Australian outback, the Great Barrier Reef, the Walled City of Hong Kong, and the China coast. This is held together by a paper-thin plot about nefarious goings-on in a fertility clinic.Reading this, I had the feeling that Cook loves to travel and rationalizes it as ""research"" for his novels. This is definitely one of his weaker efforts."
1,a total waste of time,"As some one who typically enjoys spy thrillers and murder mysteries the back cover of this book looked like an interesting possibility. I was wrong. Robin Cooks attempt to capture your imagination fell far short. From the implausible world travels of the main character to her new found friends the whole thing was contrived and ridiculous. The whirl wind climax, complete with high level ties to the CDC and escape from a communist country was beyond ridiculous. Oh and the bodies that were left a long the way??? What ever became of them Marissa???? Save your time and a few bucks, look elswhere unless you just want to laugh at how poorly the story is told."
3,good reading,I picked up Vital Signs at a used book store and enjoyed this early 1992 Robin Cook medical suspense thriller. Plenty of adventure takes the protagonist from Boston to places around the world. Good reading that plays out like a cool movie.
2,Not at all Believable,"Now I remember why I stopped reading Robin Cook's books a few years back -- he strains the credulity of his readers with ridiculous situations that are totally out of the realm of possibility. When I read a medical thriller, especially one written by a doctor, I expect to find more realistic and believable material.I thought the subject of in-vitro fertilization could have been developed much better. Also, the silly sub-plots were very distracting."
2,Disappointing,"Although the subject matter of this book, in-vetro fertilization and the corruption of the experimental fertilization industry, is highly interesting and controversial, the book itself was a disappointment. Cook could have done so much more with such engaging and timely subject matter, yet contrary to the reviews provided on the book's back cover, the story is NOT believable (great white shark attack, Hong Kong mafia, and illegal smuggling of Chinese Buddhist monks into Australia). I found that the book was drawn out with unnecessary and boring descriptions, and plot tangents that had nothing to do with the story itself. Although it keeps the reader in mild suspense until the last pages, I thought the ending was predictable and not interesting enough to justify the time I spent to finish it. I write this review to help save others from wasting time on an only semi-interesting book. Try another of Cook's medical thrillers, this one is unfortunately a flop."
2,Not the best of Cook,"I like Robin Cook because he makes medical thrillers not police or mafia stories, in this book you will read everything but medical things, and at the end Marissa discovers why so many women can't have children and you don`t know why or how.Every writer must know what to write, and Dr. Cook must write medical thrillers, not other kind of books."
2,COOKIE CRUMBLING,"Robin Cook is at his best when his medical thrillers stay focused and are more suspenseful. Now Cook is trying to turn his medical thrillers into convoluted espionage thrillers, taking his characters all over the world. Here we go to Australia, Hong Kong and China. Drawn out, unbelievable situations and meandering dialogue draw this book down. I liked the character of Tristan Williams, but both Marissa and Wendy get a little too much, and I can't blame husband Robert for his disdain with Marissa's antics. Of all the Cook books (ha, no pun intended) I've read, this is his least effective."
3,A little lacking,"This one was not exactly up to par. It was a little far fetched and you knew the end at least halfway into the book. If you're looking for something quick to read, go for it. If you're looking for something that is a little bit more believable and edge of your seat, try another one of his books."
2,Very slow and drawn out ending,"If you have read Contagion or Terminal then you have read Vital Signs. Although, these two books are better than Vital Signs. I am a big Robin Cook fan but this book was not upto his usual standards. It was very predictable and yet the ending was very drawn out. It became frustrating the further I read. It also has the typical Robin Cook conspiracy behind it, which is what makes it so predictable. Chose one of his earlier works if you want a thriller."
4,Fact and Fiction,"Being a fan of medical thrillers and Robin Cook in particular I can understand the frustration som readers have felt that this book is not believable. This more than some of his later works is a fictional romp backed up with some alarming medical facts. As in all his books the premise is the same, this time a doctoe desperate for a baby is in IVF. Her rare condition turns out not to be rare. She and an old friend, another doctoe with the same condition become suspicious. What was a departure for Cook was the chase round the world as they are persued by mafia, triads and gangsters. If you read it with the understanding it is only a piece of fiction you won't be disappointed."
3,"A pleasant enough book, but leaves room for improvement.","Although Robin Cook is a good medical thriller writer, I was a bit disappointed in this specific novel. I took an immediate dislike to the lead female character, Marissa, when she blamed her husband for being insensitive and worried about only money. I felt her attitude was insenstive as well, since her husband obviously felt uncomfortable about in-vetro fertilization and did not want to continue. I felt that she had been callous towards his feelings, and it cannot be said that he did not want any. He was even willing to adopt. The plot was a bit thin too, when it seemed a bit transparent as to why the Chinese doctors were present. As in most of his books, money played a major part in the scheme. It just took a matter of figuring out how money could be made. I would have to say that Vital Signs had not exactly matched my expectations compared to his other novels."
2,Disappointing,"And very predictable. I've read quite a few of Robin Cook's earlier books and this one started out promisingly enough. He does stretch credulity somewhat though when his characters break into a medical facility and are able, within minutes, to access confidential medical information on other patients.Mr Cook is also a lot more at home in Boston. I suggest he keeps his future books located there. His bloopers regarding Australia were legion and the idea of two caucasiaan doctors going to Hong Kong with the idea of getting information from one of the triads there was naive at the very least.I will persevere with some of Mr Cook's later books and hope that they are an improvement on 'Vital Signs'"
4,I think they are great,"I simply bought these so I could easily detach my keys so when I drop my car off at the mechanic, or go into the gym. I think they are great-they came in a variety of colors and sizes. I obviously don't think they will hold up if you were using them for more heavy duty purposes, but for smaller things they are built well. I am happy about my purchase!"
4,Very Sweet and a Little Different,"If you aren't careful, you could dismiss this effort by the Whitstein Bros as just another bluegrass familial duo, but you wouldn't get much farther than the opening track before you realize that there is something a little different here. With the sweet lyricism of Tony Rice or the Everly Bros, and a good splash of frank charm, this eclectic CD is sweet to the ear and good for a weary heart. If there is a moment of discomfort, it is the first time you hear them sing Sounds of Silence with a southern twang, but even that incongrous combination melds into the whole for a thouroughly pleasing effect. It is the kind of CD that you put on at work and hit the repeat button . . . a lot."
4,Does the job,"The PR50 chronograph is easy to operate, and best of all features the sapphire crystal and hardened metal case that the other reviewers have raved about here. For everyday wear, you'll find this Tissot can take a jolt and survive a ding and come out looking fresh out of its box. It's comfortable and keeps the kind of accurate time you'd expect from a high end quartz. For someone with mid-size to small wrists, I have found the leather band to be a little on the short side - the only real peeve about what's otherwise a great watch. Luxurywatchstore was a top notch seller, too, I should add - provided insurance, tracking information, customs updates, secure packaging and speedy ground courier service. No complaints whatsoever."
4,"Accurate, good looking, a bit heavy","The watch is a bit thicker and heavier than I expected, but it is actually comfortable to wear. It comes in a very heavy box, but the instructions for use are rather skimpy. It has taken me a while to work out how to set and use the three little dials. The minute and hour hands glow nicely in the dark."
2,It's too small,"The watch itself its good, nice band, everything a Tissot it's suposed to be. But it's way too small for a man's watch. When i received i was very disappointed."
4,pr50 chrono,"I bought this watch roughly 3 years ago, in 2006. It really is excellent. It keeps time extremely well, I once synchronized it to the national atomic clock website and after a year it had only lost a few seconds. Also 3 years later the crystal face is flawless. I am by no means a watch expert but I would recommend it, it's extremely well built, as another reviewer said the glow-in-the-dark hands work really well... I really have no complaints. Another thing worth mentioning is after so much use the watch hands still align perfectly with the notches in the dial, it is a precision piece of equipment. I paid 300 for it at a torneau back then, at $199 it's a steal."
3,Nice on me...,i bought this as a birthday gift for my husband. he gave it to me instead as it looks too small on his wrist. all i have to say is that this pair of watch did look nice on me instead.
1,Whoopi's Worst Movie,"Do not buy this movie unless you want to be bored. Whoopi Goldberg is one of my FAVORITES but this movie was just awful. Every actor has a movie that should have stayed on the cutting room floor. A much better buy would be her stand up routines on: Whoopi Goldberg, Live on Broadway. Very moving, funny and insightful."
2,Disappointing - An Intro for Grade School Geography Classes,"This video provided 25 minutes of generic film footage, interspersed with simplistic narration describing the general characteristics of Costa Rica. This documentary reminded me of the films we watched in elementary school, which were always followed by quizzes with questions like ""Name two beaches in Costa Rica"" and ""Name the volcano featured in the film.""I was hoping for some good scenes of the country and information on places to visit. Unfortunately, much of the video is comprised of stock footage of people water skiing, children playing on the beach, and tourists looking at local crafts in the city markets.If you are planning a visit to Costa Rica, buy the Lonely Planet guidebook and wait to see the sights in person."
5,American History in Black & White,This book was an eye opener. The best history book I've ever read. I would especially recommend it for anyone who wants to know the truth. It may upset you to learn about all the things they are not teaching in our schools.
3,Whadda ya want for $5 delivered?,"Gonna be a tough guy on this one.. that may be a photo of the Hoover bags pictured but ya don't get 'em so don't be shocked when ya don't ..what ya do get is a decent USA made brand bag manufactured by ""DVC"" corp... these vacuums are getting ancient... and geniune Hoover* bags are getting harder to come by or are very expensive (double or triple the price per bag) compared to these.. so at least you get a product MADE IN USA and it looks to be of good quality..and you don't have to buy a dozen to get a good price..after all .. who knows how long these old things will hang on???just don't push the bags so long.. replace 'em when nearly full..not after being full... and you'll likely be fine.. if not.. simply don't buy 'em again.. and you're only $5 behind... Please don't cry now.... ;o)) .. Regards"
2,"Hoove ""type"" vac. bags","I was disappointed in the quality of the bags. They were not near the quality of Hoover brand bags. And with shipping, not really that much cheaper."
2,Has some historical value,".. There are some nice shots of some great old ballparks that are no longer around, and the opportunity to see some players from a different era .. but it seems there was alot of editing of the film/reels that leaves one feeling that there should have been more to it. (In fairness, maybe this is the only footage availible due to damage to the originals reels), ..there is alot of jumping from game one of a particular World Series to game five, six, or seven. I like the 1951-1967 set, as any baseball fan would, but I felt there were too many missing pieces. If this set was $19.95, or at most $24.95, it would be a fair price, but $49.95 is twice what it is actually worth. But if you love old baseball highlight reels, you may not mind the inflated price."
3,"A good, but dissappointing followup to the first...","I own the first vol and expected this to be more of the same, which would of made me a lot happier. I felt that the tracks on this album were slower and over-simplified (not enough instruments or variety) compared to the first. Picking slower tracks just took out the energy that the original had. Still, the slower pace of this CD makes it a good chill album. The tango element is still there, yet I heard a little bit more piano that I wanted. And there are a few tracks with vocals - that's just something I don't ever want to hear in something like this(the first didn't have any).Overall, good to listen to but doesn't compare well to the first. A lot better than other tango chill albums (not like there are many!). If you haven't listened to the first yet, BUY THAT ONE. Then consider this."
4,it really is chill,If you like Electric Tango that fuses traditional instrumental sounds with uptempo beats this is it. Every Gotan Project fan will appreciate this compolation.
4,KYB Gas-adjust front shocks,I installed the KYB gas-adjust units on the front and KYB Mono Max on the rear of my 02 Dodge Ram 1500. There is a noticeable change in the ride characteristics. There is less body roll in turns and definite firm ride over OEM when unloaded. The mono max helps considerably with control aspects when pulling a 3000 lb tool trailer. The rear shimmy and uncertanity is gone. I would recommend this setup for anyone looking for increased control on a large vehicle that you work or drive hard.
3,The book,"The book ""Temperate Forests"" by Michael Allaby was a very interesting book. It helped me a lot in learning about temperate forests. I reccomend this book to all kids 11 and older. I wouldn't reccomend this book to a 10 years old though because it isnt the easiest to understand."
1,Have been done - buyer beware,"I absolutely love Jil Sander Background, and thought this would make a great stocking filler. Unfortunately, when the bottle arrived it turned out to be a sample that clearly states that it is not for sale - so while there is nothing wrong with the product itself, I clearly have been done as it was sold to me. Buyer beware of this seller!"
5,Hilarious and side spliting book,"Want to laugh, then get Sydney Molare's latest novel ""GRANDMAMA'S MOJO STILL WORKING' and you will crack up after you meet a 75 year old diva who had numerous men attending to her beck and call. Ms. Adoll who likes to be referred to as Madam A is truly a modern day LADY that knows how to take care of her business and come out on the winning end.Ms. Molare's style of writing will keep you laughing out loud and you will be happy and truly content, once the reading trip is finalized."
1,Horrible,"This is by far the worst product McAfee has ever came out with. It is imcompatible with many hardware devices and software applications causing them to act very strangely. It is a resource hog and uses about 250mb-300mb of memory and will reduce even a powerful computer to a constant crawl.There is no way to temporaily turn it off. It always on, and always slowing you down.I am RMAing the product back to McAfee for a full refund."
1,Problamatic,"At this point I am unable to assign a rating to Internet Security Suite 2007. The reason for this is that up to this point I have been unable to get it to work on my computer. Installation goes flawlesly but when, after installation, I attempt to connect to the internet I am blocked. I should point out that prior to purchasing I.S.S. 2007 I had installed on my computer Internet Security Suite 2005. This worked flawlesly and I would have to give it 5 stars. Technical support tried but it was a no go. I use a dial up connection through Juno, have Internet Explorer 6 (these were questions tech support asked and still came up with no reason for the problem )."
1,Bundle of Problems,"I've used Mcafee for years and generally, never had any problems. It's not as invasive as Norton, which will seep into every nook and cranny of your system making it impossible to delete and/or manage.Unfortunately though, this multi user versoin of Mcafee is a nightmare. I installed it on 2 different computers, both running Windows XP, and had to systems restore both. On computer startup, I got at least a half dozen errors ranging from problems with Google desktop to mysteriously missing.dll files.I'd suggest that you wait a few months for another iteration and save yourself a lot of problems."
1,um what the heck mcafee?,"Don't bother using this product, especially if you're running Windows Vista. I had this product on a previous computer with XP and for the most part it worked fine, although it slowed down the computer. The 2006 version was better for XP. As for using it on Vista, don't try unless you know anything about computers and safe modes and what to do when the computer errors and crashes. Because that's what it did to my computer about 4 times over until I finally managed to get it to start up in safe mode so I could uninstall it. What a nightmare."
1,A piece of junk,"Their latest software update has a problem. EMPROXY eats up 100% of the CPU. Two hours with their ""free"" tech chat guy to try a few things I had already done. I'm switching to AVG free AV. I'm only sorry that I had to give it even a one star rating!"
1,"u-buy, u-computer die!",My 2003 gateway had this stuff on it when it's worthless defenses were hacked by a malicious hacker. This thing did what it's Wiki entry said it does to others; continuous pop-up warnings for friendly sites that I was unable to turn off.
5,Loved it!!,"I didn't read the first book in this series, but I certainly wish I had - just to get more time with these characters!I loved that the author did not pull a ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and have you pine for the characters but only have them be together for a few pages at the end. The circumstances are written so that they spend a lot of time together rediscovering each other, and themselves.I can't wait to go back to #1 and read it - even though I know how it ends!"
3,An ok book,This book was pretty good. I didn't like it as much as the first one- A Rush of Wings which was much better but I am glad she made a sequel so we could find out about the second brother-Morgan. This book is sad so bring a box of tissues with you when you read it!
3,The Still of Night,"I loved Morgan in Rush of Wings. I loved his charm and intellect. I was so excited to read this book but was a little disappointed. I'm very glad I read it but just know that it took a lot of book to write a small story. I did like that it was not predicable at all doesn't end quite as you'd expect. But again, too much to read for such a small story to tell. I kept skipping paragraphs."
4,Too realistic to be fiction,Great writing. I couldn't put the book down. But very real and a little too close to home. It really makes you think. You'll definitely need tissue if you read this book.
2,Goes off withour warning!!,"This is a great toy if you do not mind it going off in the middle of the night without warning and saying things like, ""Quick, let's get going there's a fire!"" and fire engine sounds and the fire dog barking!You see, there is no on/off switch. Also you can not stop it because you can not open the battery compartment.Adorable! But do not buy!!"
5,They seem to breath better than the other generic products.,I've used these in a 26 year old Eureka canister vacuum.They performed better than the last aftermarket bags that I purchased. I don't remember the last ones manufacturer.Satisfied with these so far ( 10/2012).
4,Loved this book!,"I agree with the other review to some extent- but it can't be blamed on the book. Water avaialability will greatly vary depending on season. And no matter how good your guide may be, you should always consult local rangers and have topo map for anything not 'trailed'. I also have Afoot and Afeild and HATE it. It wasn't descriptive enough and made things far more confusing than necessary. Hiking Southern Nevada and Las Vegas both have been valuable tools for planning trips and selecting hikes. Then we gather our 'background' info before heading out."
3,good,but I thought would have more pages to use saw one one time that had more activities to use in preschool.
4,Searching for Robert Johnson,"Robert Johnson may be better known for the mysteries surrounding his short life than for the music he recorded. Even people who are not blues music enthusiasts have at least a passing familiarity with his legend. As good as his recordings are, it is easy to get overwhelmed by the reverence in which they are held by the faithful. In this slender volume, esteemed music historian Peter Guralnick sheds some light on the real Robert Johnson, both his life and his music. Like a volume in the Penguin Lives series, Guralnick blends a `just the facts' approach with enough commentary to make the book both quick and thorough. He spends just the right amount of time familiarizing the reader with Johnson predecessors and contemporaries like Charlie Patton and Son House, and provides some critical analysis of Johnson's recordings. This is a perfect book if the reader is seeking more information on Johnson, and an excellent introduction to the mythic creators of the Delta blues."
2,Nothing in this small book that I didn't already know!,"Very small book, not very much information involved here. I can't give this my endorsement! If you know anything about Robert Johnson, you won't need this book!"
3,Check the years!,Use the compatibility chart. This book only covers Mercury Capri 1979-1986. You may see this title in shops mis-identified.
3,mustang man,Buy a Chilton and save the headache. These are good for the moderately experienced mechanic.
1,Has to be a third world copy,"Maybe this double side disk is legal, but it sure looked like something copied in a third world country. I was able to see Family Vacation on side one (unlabeled)but the reverse side(European Vacation) was a total mess. I tried to view it on different systems, courtesy of our neighbors, but to no avail. I'll contact Amazon to see if I can get a partial refund for the European Vacation side of the disk. In the meantime, be wary of this seller!!"
2,Poor DVD Quality,"I wish that people would stop reviewing the actual movies on Amazon and review the technical qualities of the product (the DVD) only. There are other places on the web to give movie reviews (IMDB for example). I bought this DVD because it was cheap, had two great movies on one disc, and didn't mind paying less money for the DVD version of these movies as opposed to paying more money for the Blu-ray versions. I knew that I wasn't going to get hi-def, Blu-ray quality copies of these movies by getting the DVD but the image quality on this DVD is severely lacking. The picture quality is not sharp and is fuzzy at times and there are a lot of film scratches and blemishes visable in the images. It's as though I bought VHS-quality versions of these movies to play on my DVD player. 2 stars only because this thing was only $6. But even at $6 it's a bit of a rip off.I believe this DVD was meant for sale in Canada as the DVD cover is labeled as such."
5,Comedy Double,"Great movies from the past. It is a little dated,but you will still laugh at some of the stuff that they do in this movie."
5,Great gift!,"I bought this as part of an anniversary gift for my husband. He enjoyed comics as a kid and enjoys all the movies that have been made based on comics.Well, he loves this. He spends time each night reading the comics- he's catching up on the more recent ones before going back to the comics from the past.Great gift for the guy who is still a kid at heart. :)"
3,kind of disappointed,it's a good product. it just doesn't tell you that it's only for UNCANNY X-MEN so if you are not familiar with the history of them you'll be out of the loop when it references other X-MEN titles or the story continues elsewhere. other than that I have no complaints.
5,40 Years of the X-Men,"Remember when comics were less than a dollar an issue? Remember the original X-men? If you said, ""Yes"" to either of these questions, this DVD is for you. This DVD is scanned comic books and it takes me back to when I was a kid. The only thing I miss is actually holding the comic in my hands. This is a fantastic product!"
5,Excellent!,Very helpful if you are trying to collect x-men since the beginning. Easy to read and easy to find the comic by year.
1,"yes, but there's a better way...","I bought this when it did not say that the comics were in pdf. Had I known I wouldn't have bothered. Several of the other sets were in .cbr or .cbv format which is a zipped or rar archive file set up to be read by a free program called Comic Book Reader which was included with the dvd. The controls are MUCH better than Adobe Acrobat and are CUSTOMIZABLE! So you can set it up to view the way you like and it stays that way.I am waiting for them to go back to this format, as pdf's are not meant to be read easily. You can't mouse click to flip between the pages.I fail to understand why they decided to go with pdf files, since extracting the pix from a pdf is pretty easy. All they did was make it harder to view the files.BOO! As cheap as this is, hold out for a return to the easier and better format.PS: you can also unzip .cbz or .cbr files and edit the pix. I like cleaning them up and fixing coloring defects as well as rotating any pages that were printed sideways."
4,"Decent, not amazing","It's a ridiculously great price for so many comics that much is most definitely true. However, the scans were grainy and since it is only the Uncanny X-Men titles many of the story arcs (which often cross over to other titles) made chronological reading unpleasant.To sum up, It's more then 500 issues for 30$ so it's such a great price that it's almost too good to pass up."
4,good but not great,"the item got to me pretty fast. It works fine. It just is not the same to have comic book on a computer. I like the paper backs better, but for the price it is worth it."
4,Best way to catch up,As an xmen fan I found this product to be the best method of catching up with the entire back story. Being able to view the comics as published in full color was great. you could print them out if you desire but have to put up with the copyright watermark though every frame. By far this is the cheapest method of catching all these back comics and collectors books. A great addition to any fans collection.
2,like constant glare on your tv! aaargh!!,"i have been an x-men fan since the 70's. i love marvel. i love the x-men. i completely understand the need for copyright protections. however, trying to read the comics on this dvd-rom is nothing short of irritating. yes, you can mess around with your acrobat or preview (mac) settings to make all the pages display right but in the end you have to try not to be completely distracted by the big ole ""MARVEL"" watermark right in the middle of every page...every PHOTOCOPIED page. honestly, it's like trying to watch your favorite movie on a VERY sunny day with a big open window directly across from the tv screen! as a devotee of john byrne's art it has ,sadly, really limited my enjoyment of this product."
2,A Chimp With a Xerox Machine,"This package in a nutshell is all of the Uncanny X-men comics scanned in a decent resolution. Which is NOT every X-men story. To top it off X-men, because it branched off into different cover franchises, have many story arcs that cross over to the other series. Which means you will Read part 1 of an arc and then next issue you'll be reading part 6.Age of Apocalypse seems to be entirely missing as well.A little more thought should have been put into this in order to make this worth a buy. Anyone with a robust Marvel collection and a decent scanner could've done a better job putting this package together."
2,I wouldnt buy this if I where you.,"this comes with the first 461 issues of uncanny x-men plus annuals and the giant size. Its all great up till the mid eighties where new mutants, x-factor, wolverine,and Excalibur start their runs. So you miss out on all of those great stories from there mags which is frustrating. And you don't get any of the graphic novels, mini series, or one shots either. Then things get really bad in the nineties when they split the team into two groups and introduce the just plain x-men mag plus countless other mags that you don't get. Another problem is they do a whole bunch of crossover events so you only get bits and pieces of big story arch's like inferno, executioners song, mutant massacre, etc. No age of apocalypse either which is disappointing. Sigh, I wish when they released this it would've come with every x mag and comic that featured the x-men and put them all in chronological order, now that would be awesome40 Years of the X-Men."
4,X marks the spot,"Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.And the earliest years are, of course, somewhat crude (heretically, even the Kirby artwork in the first year is).But very nice to have in an affordable edition, regardless of the flaws (though best viewed with a large monitor."
5,Amazing Steam,"If you love steam trains, this is a must. One of the best bargains I've ever purchased. Most of it is excursions, but don't let that stop you. It seems to cover about every steam excursion in the U.S. during the 90's, and there were plenty. Plus some footage from the old days. Better to watch from the outside, as with a DVD, than being on the train. You see more. Photography and sound amazing, and knowledgeable commentary interesting. Thank you, producers."
2,To childish for adult fans.,"This book is geared to children between the ages of 10 to 13 years old which is too young for most Buffy fans. I don't really care much for this type of book, but I thought I would give it a try because I am a huge Buffy and Angel fan, and there have been some very good books written about them. However, this book is not one of them. The characters and the plot were very two dimentional and not that interesting.As the actors on BTVS and Angel aged, so have the fans. We need some more Adult level books for a more mature fan base.My recommendation is, if you are over 15 you may want to skip this one."
4,Better.,"Well this book wasn't the best, but it was way better than Colony. The dialogue was pretty good as was the action. Enjoyed it overall."
1,When will Fox learn?,"Way too embarrassed to buy this swill. Hey Fox, buy a clue, most fans are way beyond the utter trash you are trying to sell as Buffyverse books. This is a fandom that prides itself on loving an intellectual show, and being fairly smart themselves and mature. You bright boys think the equivalent of scratch and sniff is a light bulb moment. This is great for the bangels, because you know they're twelve. But everyone else, the vast majority, can only run to fan fic and read for free. Got that... pay close attention, you're losing out big time."
5,choose THIS adventure,"At first I wasn't sure that the ""choose your own adventure"" genre would be a good fit for Buffy. But then I read this book and it was non-stop fun, from start to finish(es). Clearly the author knows the ins and outs of the characters while spinning a compelling plot. This book should not be limited to the bangels-all should enjoy!"
3,Primera lectura de Roberto Bolaño,"Este es el primer libro que leo de Roberto Bolaño. Sus libros tienen buena crítica pero a mi este me ha dejado decepcionado.Es un libro corto, de 150 paginas. Tiene dos párrafos y el segundo esta en la pagina 150 con 8 palabras solamente. Encontré bastante incomodo leer un libro sin párrafos (por no mencionar capítulos, etc). Cuando estas leyendo te sientes como que vas en un tren de alta velocidad, lo mejor es leer el libro completo de una vez.El libro se pone interesante cuando el personaje principal, Fr. Urrutiacomienza a dar clases a un grupo particular de personajes.De todas formas espero que sus dos libros más famosos;Los Detectives Salvajes/the Savage Detectives (Spanish Edition)y2666 (Spanish Edition)sean mas interesantes y mas ""digeribles"" que este."
1,Sí y solo sí...,"Recomendaría leer este libro sí y solo sí estas en alguna de las siguientes condiciones: en un hospital, en la cárcel, en una isla desierta, o en algun otro lugar donde no tengas acceso a ningún otro libro; en otras palabras: si es la única opción disponible. Yo lo he leído porque tardé un poco en hacer un nuevo pedido y no tenía nada más a mano. Ya antes de llegar a la mitad me sentía decepcionada y abrumada, el libro me resulta algo así como un sudoku diabolico al que se le han añadido letras para hacerlo todavía más incómodo. Sea cual sea la intención de su autor a mi me ha parecido incoherentemente anárquico y viceversa. Es el primer libro de Bolano que leo y no me he quedado con deseos de seguir su obra."
5,Fantastic,"Get hip to Bolano. His short stories are electrifying, a real revelation. I am enjoying Los Detectives Salvajes right now. Bolano was an intelligent writer: nuanced like Dylan Thomas, suspenseful like Kafka, learned like Borges, but with a modern fierceness and humor. Bolano is the heir to the wealth of all the best writers before him. I am thrilled to be reading such a talented writer."
4,"""A TALE OF SUPERNATURAL TERROR""","This book is a passionate mixture of earthly fears and supernatural terror. S Monique Craig does an extraordinary job with her writing, drawing you right in with her tale of characters it makes you feel like you're right there with Nikki.As Nikki's life undresses layer-by-layer right before your very eyes, she finds herself caught up in a dark adventure of murder and mystery. Illustrated by the author, this book was a pleasant surprise and can be read in one sitting. Sit back and enjoy.---- Shi-fu Jerome Dookie"
5,play guns are pink and cute!,"Pink Guns are so cute, granddaughter just loved them, got her complete cowgirl outfit! Just loved it!Gun are made very good, they work good! Nice because they have an orange tip, to make sure they no they are pretend! Shelly"
2,"Pretty, but hard to shoot","I tried to get my ""cowgirl"" to get some black guns which were much cheaper. She said ""That's Ok, mama Santa is making me pink guns."" So needless to say, ""Santa"" ended up ordering them. They are very, very, pretty and the holsters seem well made. However the guns are very difficult to shoot and our five year old became very frustrated with them. Also on Christmas day, my husband pulled the trigger and a piece broke off of one of them, and he had not pulled hard or anything. These appear to be the only pink guns on the web, I looked hard. If you have a cowgirl like mine, who has her heart set on pink guns, you may have little choice. If she is open to different colors I am sure there are other ones out there that are better made and easier to shoot."
3,well...,"These are okay. They are cute but very hard to pull the triggers. My 5 year old daughter can't pull the triggers on her own, I bought the cap rolls and they are worthless, not sure if it is the caps or the guns but the caps only strike right about 1 to every 5-7 pulls (When I'm pulling the trigger). I find it very frustrating, my daughter loves them however, and only complains mildly every once in awhile about the trigger pull and just plays them mostly by holding them and making the gun noise. I just wasted the money on the caps because they have never been used but the one time. They just don't work well enough to even mess with loading them :( They are pretty heavy and seem to be made with good quality though....."
3,Made in China,"These functioned OK.Better than plastic models,.Slide mount to load caps is hard to open.Holsters are flimsy.Ok for a 3 year old."
3,As expected...,It is what it is! Cheap metal cap guns just like the ones you grew up with! No complaints here!
2,"Okay looking, but hard for a little girl to fire the caps","This is more for looks than for use. We bought a few cap guns for Christmas and this particular one requires roll caps - they were hard to install, keep straight, and very difficult for the 6 year old to pull the trigger on and play with her grandpa.As it turns out grandpa, who we bought a cap gun for too - had the other kind of caps and she preferred his gun and could use it much easier. So, other than just seeing that it was pink - it was too much trouble to really play with."
3,"Cute, but heavy","This double holster and pistols was great in looks for my daughter's Cow Girl costume for Halloween. She thought it was very girly and loved how they looked; however, the set was VERY heavy in weight. So much so, that it completely pulled her skirt down from one end of the hall to the end. After a few pictures we had to remove them so she could walk. If they were just a tab bit lighter they would have been great. I would recommend them to others, but as a toy for inside."
1,Hoover Portapower disposal bags,I purchased the Genuine Hoover bags for the Hoover Portapower and they do not fit properly. They are too narrow at the opening and the dirt goes around them and into the permanent bag. Waste of money.
1,vacumm bags don't fit at all,"These vacumm bags are worthless for this vacumm. They do not fit at all for the Hoover Portapowr vacumm. It was a total waste of money. It's just an open bag on the top, there is no collar."
1,"Bag is useless, too small",These bags are 2 small for this vacuum and there's no ring to attach it.I won't use them. This was a waste of money.I may be able to use them for popcorn or something...
3,wrong bags,"The order came quick,but they are not the bags I needed. I have a Eureka vac that uses N bags. I did not know the if you buy a N bag from another manufacturer they are not the same bag, so I have bags that can not be used. I think the vac industry should have a standard format for numbering there bags so if you go to a store and need bags you can get any bag from any manufacturer with the number they need."
5,Review for Hoover Canister vacuum bags,Have not used them yet-I have been using the cloth bag so far. They shipped very quickly though.
4,Very Stimulating and Thorough,"I burned through this book in five hours, I just couldn't put it down. My only beef that there wasn't enough love scenes. I could totally relate to the pain that Kari was feeling towards Johnathan, do you follow your heart or follow society? Some may not like the portrayal of Kari's fiancee in this book, but like all races on this planet there are a few bad ones and the rest are great. If want to read a book full of passion and love, with a healthy dose of heartache definitely pick this one. The ending will not disappoint you either."
2,Those babies,"Grrrrh! If Kari said ""those babies"" one more time in that book I would have burned it. The color of trouble is the story of Kari and Steve who were lovers years ago. Steve sort of cheats on Kari and they break up. Later a lawsuit angist Kari brings them back to get her. The trouble lies with in Kari. I found her to be too weak. She never really seemed like she wanted Steven back. She was to wishy washy. I'm sorry but I just can't see them spending the rest of their life together. I think Steve need some on who stuck to their convictions better. And then Kari kept talking about ""those babies"" What are they pieces of wood? Her her out look on motherhood and children was a little bit dusturbing. I will however give the book props for taking a honest look at it. Some people really feel that way. At lest Kari was honest to herself. I'll give it two stars for that."
3,interesting..but missing something,"I felt the story was ok...the setup of Jon did not seem all that believable. When I initially began to read the book, I put it down it just did not seem real. Kari's character was weak, I do not too many sistas with such a meek persona, nevertheless I picked up the book again and found the storyline became more interesting. I would have to agree with some of the other readers, about Kari's love for Jon. I was not entirely convinced she was in love with him. It is an interesting read, but the characters lacked substance."
3,Wimpy Book.,Wimpy herion that never made me believe she was in love with Jonathan. I never felt the connection between these two. Kara was just to undecided of which man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. If you like I/R stories like me than read one of Judith Smith-Levin books or Seressia Glass. So much better than this one.
1,Rush Job,"This was another example of poor character and plot development. I grimace at the concept of calling this book a romance.These two people were not ""in love"" but rather lust. I found the behavior of both characters lacking. The best character of the entire book is the minister at the end of the novel. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Unbelievable,"For those who have any knowledge of the law, the book starts badly. Jon is in jail for rape and the love of his life believes that he had an affair and is marrying the victim. If this were true how could he be in jail for rape? He stays in jail for 7 months. (What happended to the right to a speedy trial)The story doesn't get much better from there. No contact for seven years and they are still in love. Unbelieveable beginning and unbelievable ending and the female lead is not particulary likable."
3,"Too real, too painful","This was a good story but it hit too close to home for me, having been in a relationship when I was in college with a white guy whose parents more than disapproved of his relationship with me because I was not white and did what they could to make it hard for us to be together. So, if you have a similar experience in your past, stay away from this book or be prepared to be in an emotional funk afterwards (or have another uplifting book to read after this one). I read to escape, and this didn't do it for me. That's why it was just ok (3 stars)."
1,Poor story,"I read the reviews for this book and I was looking forward to reading this book. When I did purchase this book I was very disappointed. I thought that main characters Kari and Steven were one dimensional, there wasn't any depth to them at all. I also felt that there was no chemistry between these two characters. I didn't feel that there was much a plot to this book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,the hate is real,The heat flowed off the pages about this couple .The real passion that we felt from Jon made you cheer him on and turn the pages to see if Kari would respond.I felt let down with the confessions and revelations of blackmail.The charators developement was wonderful but in the end they seem to miss their big chance to be fullfiled.They just walk away at the peak.
2,Better off saving your money,"After reading many sterling reviews of this book my expectations were very high which is why this book left me thoroughly disappointed. My problem with the book lies with the main character, Kari Thomas. Throughout a good three-forths of the book I found myself wondering why the Jon would even want a relationship with her. She had no backbone and basically allowed her parents and her new ""black"" fiance to make all her decisions for her. By the time she got her backbone she was past the point of even being liked. She was completely unlikeable and didn't seem to be as in love with Jon, as he was with her. There was just nothing there to like about her. I ended with the feeling that Jon would be better off without her."
1,A Waste of Time!,"This is the story of Kari Anderson (black) and Jonathan (white) who were lovers while they were going to college and whose relationship unraveled after a series of lies and half-truths. This book was difficult to get through because of the fact that Kari lacked a backbone and did not stand up to her parents bigotry, ending up being on the verge of marrying a black man, a man she does not love to ensure she would produce ""brown babies"" - a term used more than once throughtout the novel and one I found very aggravating. This novel received one star only because of the love scenes between Kari and Jonathan."
5,AMAZING BOOK! PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS AND PROS ALIKE!,"Teacher-Extraordinaire George Omura has written a masterpiece. This book leads you by the hand through all the intricacies of this powerful software without letting you go. I was reluctant to purchase a 1600 page book fearing that I would get lost in a pulp jungle; given my experience with big, disorganized books. This book was a pleasant surprise well worth its price. If you're a beginner this is the book for you. If you're experienced this is also the book for you."
2,"This book is a reference, not a tutorial","Some comments on this book are misleading.After seeing many five stars comments onthis book, I bought it as a tutorial.After reading this book and using thesoftware for several weeks, I had not learnedmuch. I decided to give up this book.My friend used this book for learningAutoCad, she also had to give up.Later I decided to buy another AutoCad book, called""AutoCad 2000 - One step at a time"", tolearn AutoCad."
2,"Green Rage - loud talk, no brains","The brief, passionate title of Manes' book certainly caught my eye. Unfortunately, Manes makes no convincing arguments on behalf of radical environmentalism in this tedious diatribe. Instead, he simply spouts empty rhetoric and a few conspiracy theories. Manes emphasizes his contention that civilization is on the brink of collapse due to our violent attitude toward nature. Do we need to change our attitude toward nature? Well, I think so. Will Manes' book convince anybody of this? I doubt it. If you want to read a good book about the Earth First! movement, read ""Confessions of an Eco-Warrior,"" a homey but surprisingly articulate collection of essays by Dave Foreman, an on-again, off-again proponent of radicalism. The best I can say about Green Rage is that if you are into radical environmentalism, it will get you riled up. The worst I can say is that it does a disservice to the environment by being a waste of the paper it is printed on."
2,Disappointment,I had seen the author make presentations on television before and thought this would be a great video to own. Had I seen parts of it prior to purchase I would not have bought it. Most of the video is him talking to TBN hosts. It would have been a better video witout the connection of TBN hosts. He should have talked to the audience (or camera) and not to the two people sitting there with him.The presentation was subdued and I have to say boring. Great information was provided but you had to force yourself to stay awake to hear it.I was also disappointed that the segnments all started with the same introduction. It was like it was an addition to add more time to the length of the video so you could advertise it as a longer length.Very disappointed.For anyone else I recommend you skip the movie and buy the book.
5,Enlightened,So refreshing to here and understand the truth about the origin of our country. So much information given in a very understandable manner. So glad I found out about this series and will be sharing this package with my family of 9 grandchildren. So much of these historical facts are lost in school room setting. Such joy to learn of these historical facts even now at this stage of my life.
1,Not good for purpose of learning,"I purchased this series thinking it would be a great jumping off point for our home school lessons this year on government and history. However, while there is SOME good information in the DVD's, the format is terrible. It is done in sound bites that appear to have been intended to show maybe to Sunday school groups or bible study groups. It is not something you can sit down and just watch. It was a complete waste of money for our purpose. David Barton has other DVD's, and I would suggest that if you are looking for history and government DVD's with a Christian worldview, that you look at his other DVD's and skip this series!"
3,"Information, great. Presentation, not so much","I agree with other reviewers who are disappointed with this series. The history that is presented is greatly offset by the two ""hosts"" who repeat EVERYTHING David Barton says!! And I mean EVERYTHING!! Very disconcerting and annoying. The hosts waste much time in this series that could have been used by Mr. Barton. Full price, this set is $80. I'm glad I didn't pay full price because it would have been a waste, imo. I've watched, perhaps, the first 3 DVDs. I haven't been able to subject myself the last 3 yet."
3,American Heritage Series,I enjoyed the message David tries to portray and have respect for what he is trying to tell us. I am disappointed in his presentation. Our family home schools our children and we were hoping to be able to use the series to educate our children about the christian message. The American Heritage Series is basically just a long lecture. Its an unpolished narrated lecture that makes history boring like they do in many classrooms. David is like the expert professor who puts his class to sleep because of presentation. I rate him 3 stars. Actually an average of 5 stars for content and 1 star for presentation.
5,Bringing back America,"I'm really looking forward to viewing the whole series. Over the summer, we hope to have a regular get together to view and discuss."
5,The Truth about our Founding Fathers,"What I enjoyed about the series is that it proves it's conclusions about the Founding Fathers from actual documents written back in day, 1700's - 1800's. This author does not rely on modern day interpretations. The actual documents speak for themselves. There is also a website to go to that tells you where to find these documents. [...] . The video quality is first rate and interesting. David Barton appears to be very knowledgeable and sincere.As with anything, I did not like the commercial endorsements on every episode, but such is life. I can speed right by them. Knowing the real history makes a difference as to why we believe what we believe."
1,"Wow. I never knew the Stamp Act, Sugar Act, Tea Party, etc were really about religious freedom!","In the first few minutes of the first dvd of this fascinating series, we learn that the American Revolution was really about religious freedom. Not about taxation with no representation. It really wasn't about the English stifling trade in the colonies and taxing colonists to pay for the French Indian War. We finally hear the truth from the insightful personage of Dave Barton; weird leather blazer and all.The hard hitting interview conducted by the two people with the Big Hair and Nodding Heads gets to the core so quickly, I see no need for the other bunch of dvds in the set."
1,Do NOT Waste Your Money,"This set of DVDs is nothing but 20-minute Infomercials. Each of the 10 DVDs has a 20-minute infomercial. The infomercials provide a bit of information that you could probably find elsewhere for free. Then they promote the WallBuilders web site where they offer additional products.I've skimmed over the WallBuilders site, and really don't think there is anything of substance there.Your money is better spent elsewhere."
1,History by religionists instead of historians,"There should be warning labels on histories like this one that are not written by actual historians. This production is the product of embarrassingly bad research which doesn't even deserve to be called research, because it determines its conclusions before the research is done. This man will actually make up quotes from founding fathers that have no basis in fact. He actually claims that James Madison wanted the U.S. to be a Christian nation, among many other laughably inaccurate statements. It is a shame David Barton can find so many gullible customers who have not learned the most important educational lesson, the skill of critical thinking."
1,Not history.,"There is nothing worse than zealots who set out to bamboozle people in order to make a buck and promote a lie. What a bunch of garbage! Barton and Pevoto should be ashamed of their actions, but, of course, they have no shame. Everyone has access to a computer, so do a little basic research before wasting your money on something this insulting to American history and our founding fathers."
3,Repeating of information at the beginning of disc and advertising for Wallbuilders.,"Very interesting,but feel we paid for a lot of repeating of information, and advertising for Wallbuilders. I think what we have on 10 discs could have been put on half as many. We show these as a group, and would like them to be just informational."
5,Great series. should be seen by everyone,I used the american heritage series to teach my grandson things he WILL NOT be taught in school. He was amazed at the content and really loved it. I also used it to share the truth of our heritage with people in our bible study group. Would recommend to every one interested in the truth. It is now being used by my son to teach his children. Great series.
5,The American Heritage Series,This should be required viewing for all high school students. Revisionist have changed our history and this proves it. Packed with information and documentation.
5,Thank you David for educating me on the influence of religion on our Country,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement ""Separation of Church and State"" I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long, and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
5,Great Bible,"I love it, i heard about this bible when i heard someone from church talking about it and decided to get it and i am glad i got it. it is so awesome. i love every page and so easy to read and understand. I recomend it."
3,BIC DV64,I ordered these speakers after reading all the great reviews because i was wanting to upgrade my HT and I have to say I am a little let down. They don't sound bad by any means but not as good as I was expecting. They are paired with a BIC H100 sub and a DV62CLRS. I moved my pair of sony SS-F6000 to the rear from the front as did not see much of an upgrade if at all. I waited a few months to write this review because I was hoping they would wear in and come around to my liking but they never have. I would recommend trying to find a place to listen to them before you buy them.
5,by far the best speakers ive ever heard by far! crystal clear and blow away my polk speakers at half the price!!,I am an entry level audiophile who took a chance after reading good reviews on Bic speakers.I am truthfully blown away at the craftsmanship and sound quality of these speakers! I will never buy anything but Bic from now on. These speakers bring movies to life like i have never heard before.I have never been more satisfied with an eloctronics purchase before...i highly recommend trying these before wasting your money on higher priced speakers!
4,Nice Home Theater Speakers,"These speakers are very good for home theater use & have especially good bass response & blend very well with my subwoofer(Hsu Research STF2). Unfortunately they don't shine as well with music as I had hoped.These are my first set of tower speakers & I've only owned them for 2 months so maybe this review is a little premature as some people believe speakers need more time to ""break in"".I play music at very high volumes most of the time if the wife's not home & question how much time speakers really need for a break in period.Anyway these speakers are an excellent value for movies especially Blu-ray,but seem a little power hungry when it comes to music.They have a solid build quality & look nice but are not pretty.They're built like they have a job to do & they do it well for this price."
4,Impressed,Don't write reviews much but was very impressed with speakers. Great sound and look. No problems with delivery and no damage to product. I would recommend to a friend.
4,Non-maindtream brand takes sound to great values,"Bought these speakers 6 years ago. I have used them for HT and 2-channel listening. These are musical in a 2 channel set up with limitations. I am passing them onto my mother only because I did a serious upgrade from $200 speaker to $2400 speakers. The BIC DV64s are worth the money if you are looking for good sound, quality build, and your priorities demand a sensible budget."
1,Why is this still being offered?,"I ordered this, relying on the caption which says that it's eau de toilette spray, but it's not scent, it's deodorant. This was some months ago, and the company still has this ad for this product up, but have not indicated that it's not scent, but a deodorant spray. To their credit, they emailed me and told me of the discrepancy, and I chose to accept the product, anyway. But they should have removed or updated it by now."
3,Could be worse...,"I was expecting to see one-piece plastic holder rather than cardboard pieces that we had to put together. We purchased it on sale, so it is all right. I wouldn't pay $15 for it, though.It will not stand rough handling (we made a little tore of the front piece during the assembling)It was easy to assemble, and my little girl likes it so far."
3,Not very sturdy,"You put this together like a puzzle. It is made out of a foamy material that is covered with thin cardboard. It was fun to put it together. We bought several of these to use as display cases but they wont stay together on their own. We ended up using a lot of tape and glue to keep them together. The pets now stay in thier little cubbies pretty well. Each cubby can hold two to three pets. It hangs on the wall easily and is an easy way to keep them organized if your kid is relatively neat(ours are usually in piles on the floor).The most fun part seems to be using the holes as target practice for the pets, which little brother REALLY likes.I got these on crazy clearance. I would not recommend paying full price since so much time and effort went into making them functional."
3,Not what it appears,"I bought this toy for my daughter who has a collection of LPS toys. I was surprised to see when we opened the box that it is made mostly of cardboard with a little foam bord. I was dissapointed since the picture made me think that it was plastic. So far it is holding together, but I have my doubts about how it will hold up long term. Just a warning for other parents, the picture is misleading."
5,Unique and Perfect,"What a stunning album. Its really hard to get your hands on, but worth it if you are into ambient music. It would almost fall into the ambient house genre if it had more beats but falls short of it.Its not ideal for the ambient purists who want something allong the lines of biosphere, Brian Eno and Steve Roach. It is a little more mellodic but brilliant in its own right.If your into ambient/chill and you can find this album. I would suggest you buy it if you can find it."
4,Fantastic Chill out Trance,"This CD grows on you. I bought this CD ages ago, listened to it a couple of times and distregarded it for a while. I started playing it a few months later and now it rates as one of my favorite Trance CD's. The music is excellent for chilling out or for those times where you need a little escape from the plastic bands of today. Thumbs up."
1,What? Thiis isn't a vaccum.,"This is an electronic broom. For geez sake, get a vaccum. Try the Dust Devil Swivel. Works gr8 for me. Or, try a Hoover, like the Wind Tunnel. Seriously, don't get fooled. This is a broom that should be $1."
4,It's a super BROOM!,"This is not a vacuum cleaner! It is an automatic broom. It does almost as good of a job as a real broom. If you're Martha Stewart, stick with the real thing and mop afterward. If you have significantly lower standards and less time, this is a great inbetween tool to use to quickly pick up bits of stuff off your hardwood, tile or linoleum floors so barefooting it isn't a disgusting experience. You'll still need to sweep and mop every so often, but I assure you that emptying the dust cup is not nearly the pain in the butt that the ""squat to use the dustpan"" manuever is. I love my superbroom!"
2,Not for carpets,This vacuum is okay for bare floors (although you have to empty the dust cup every frequently) but don't even think about using it on area carpets or if you have animal hair on area rugs. It doesn't even budge anything that isn't loosely laying on top of the surface you're vacuuming.
1,Probably one of the worst ports of a game I've ever played,"My first experience with RE4 was on my friend's PS2. It was awesome. Since I didn't have a PS2 at the time, I bought this PC version of the game. I thought I was getting a bargain till I actually played it on my PC. Oh boy, it has to be one of the worst translations from Gamecube/PS2 to PC ports I've ever played. If the letterbox view wasn't annoying enough in the Gamecube and PS2 versions, the FUZZINESS and controls are even more annoying in the PC version. If you're a Resident Evil fanatic, I would recommend you save on a cheap used Gamecube or PS2 and play the games on those consoles the way they were meant. I highly don't recommend this PC version of such an awesome game."
1,Stay Away,"Doesn't work on Vista.Doesn't use the mouse (have fun aiming with the keyboard)What a joke, last time I buy anything from Capcom, if I can convince someone else not to waste their money I've done my good deed for the day"
2,the game that looks good but sucks,"the game is alright. i have never played a res. evil game before so i tohught ""what the heck"". turns out the game sucks, you cant move and shoot at the same time, cant customize control, their locked. i have played other games that went from xbox or play station to computer and this is by far the worst."
2,What the hell...,"I bought this game for PC hoping it owuld have mouse controls and I was ripped off. Hell Doom 95 had smoother, more intuitive controls than this junk. it may still be the same game but it's easier to play it on my iPod touch than on PC. Let's see... i own the game for PS2, Wii, iPod Touch, and now PC. Out of these the one for Wii is best, but I think I'll stick with playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. for now. Never again will i trust Capcom witha PC game."
1,Didnt run,I was unable to play the game as I got a missing file message when I tried to play it. I have tried uninstall/install several times now and it still wont play.So my review is.. not a good game.
2,Fun... but not on a PC,"I have always loved Resident Evil games - I've played previous versions on a PS and loved them. Since I only have a PC now - I was devastated by how bad this game plays on a PC. Not only is it not mouse supported, but I have yet to figure out the key strokes. The screen tells you to hit the 5 and 6 buttons to get through a scene and I finally figured out the real buttons are the left and right shift buttons. I cannot find anywhere in the game how to ""reprogram"" the keys. I finally broke down and bought a PC game controller and the buttons on it are wrong too! The game controller does make it a little easier to play, but I still have to use the keyboard on some scenes since I've yet to find the 5 and 6 keys on the controller. The game frequently freezes and flat out bombs. Many times when you start it, it will tell you no disk found - so you have to eject the disk and start again. It's a great game, but it's performance is horrible."
2,bad port for a decent game,"Very bad PC port. Be prepared with a gamepad and some skill at manually mapping it, even then you will still need the keyboard and the movements will be clunky. Very frustrating to get killed due to the controls and not your own lack of skill"
3,"Excellent console game, poor PC port","The game was written for game consoles that use gamepad type controllers. If you own a PS2 or GameCube, this is an excellent game to pick up for one of those systems. However, on the PC, it will probably cause you nothing but frustration unless you have a gamepad. Even with a gamepad, playing this style of game on your PC is going to be frustrating if you're used to mouse/keyboard first person shooters. Basically, the PC experience is disappointing."
1,Resident Evil Trash,"Wow, they got me! Shame on Ubisoft and Capcom for this piece of Junk. With all the hype and movie and all, I said wow what only $20. I figured it would be one of those $49 games. This game in not meant to be played on PC. I can live with that. They did a good job with Halo but these guys don't have a clue on how to bring a console game to PC. I saw Ubisoft a name I could trust. This from the makers of Farcry. Well this is a farcry form any good game. Some of my Valusoft games are way better than this. This game is so bad that even with all the patches It is not going in my used game box. It is going where this evil resident belongs, in the trash. And I was lucky enough to have a game pad. Don't bother buying one for this game. Then you will be out $40 for this. It is evil!!! It is not even worth the one star I gave it."
4,Resident Evil 4 review,"If you're looking for a fun first person shooter - this is certainly a good game to play. The overall mood and graphics/sounds are pretty good - you'll definitely enjoy it if you like the horror genre.I don't care much for the control configuration however. The controls are hard to master and somewhat awkward. In addition, I'm running Windows XP Home with all of my drivers updated but some of the in-game movies don't play properly. I haven't been able to find the reason; you may have no problem with it.Still, if you like Resident Evil, I'd say you have to get this one."
4,Resident Evil 4 this a fun and exciting game,Resident Evil 4 is a fun and exciting game with excellent 3D graphics that make you feel as if you are a part of the game.I would recommend this to the gamer who wants to feel like they are a part of the game.
2,Resident Disappointment for the PC,"Capcom did absolutely nothing to optimize this game for the PC. The only thing that you can do with the game is actually load it and play it. You can't adjust any settings, you can't change the resolution, you can't enhance the graphics detail, you can't do anything.Basically they took the PS2 game, put it on a disk labeled ""PC"", and put it in a box. I recently purchased ""Devil May Cry 4"" for the PC from Capcom, and it is such an improvement over ""Resident Evil 4"" as far as options and details that I can't be bothered to play ""Resident Evil 4"", it's just going to sit there for the foreseeable future."
1,Worst Port I've Ever Played !!!!,"I bought this game because the pc is the best way to play a fps. This was the most disappointed i have been playing a game. Not being able to use mouse to aim is the stupidest thing i have ever heard. Im not sure what they spent all their time on when they developed this game for the pc. They spent too much time smoking weed and not enough making a game worth playing. The graphics are darker and worse than on the gamecube or ps2. There is no option to improve the graphics. Its basically the same exact options on the gamecube and ps2. Bottom Line stay away from this like the plague. Its horrible and they should pay you to play it. However, if you own a ps2 or gamecube buy this game its awesome. Just somehow everything got lost in translation when they ported this to the pc."
2,"Nice Gameplay, Bad Controls","I played the PC version of this game and had high expectations for it. It would have made all of them except that the controls for the game were very awkward and it was hard to manuever and aim. I think if Ubisoft had taken the time and fixed up their controls for their PC version of this game, it would have made it easier to play."
1,Awkward and poorly put together addition,I am a huge RE fan and I cannot express my disappointment over the game play of the PC version. I found it so awkward to interact with and the graphics were nothing special. I am looking forward to the PS3/XBox version of RE5 in 2008 and hope for more.
1,No mouse support for PC game..dont waste your money,"I was very disappointed when I loaded this game and hope the rest of the series isn't the same with NO mouse support. I purchased them all at once. :( How do you release a game of this type, for PC and not include mouse look?Basically this is a console game (probably good in that respect) that has been hurriedly re-mapped to keyboard keys. It is nearly un-playable in this form unless you use a game pad on your PC. I don't own a game pad for the same reason I don't own a console, I don't like them. Yet CAPCOM/UBISOFT claim on the box ""keyboard and mouse"" support. This is false as even in the menu's there is no place to configure a mouse. The mouse doesn't even work in the menu screens.If your a true PC gamer and love the first person/third person shooters (using your mouse), don't bother with this one!This game (for PC) completely fails to live up to the hype. Castle Frankenstien was better, in my opinion!"
1,Worthless crap DOES NOT support a mouse!,"I waited two years for the PC version so that I wouldn't have to use sorry gamepad controls, then when I finally get it it doesn't even support a mouse at all! Despite the statement that it does support ""windows compatible mouse and keyboard"" on the game box!I feel totally cheated - I don't have a gamepad so I can't even play it!You can't even use a mouse on the selection screens! What did Ubisoft do for two years?"
1,Evil piece of PC trash,"I can't rate the game overall because after hours of dinking around with 3rd party patches which give you good graphics but absolutely p*** poor mouse control I deleted the cursed thing from my computer. The game plot, etc. may be fantastic but if you have to f*** around with sloppy and an incomprehensible control system the entertainment value plummets. I even tried my controller, which I hate, and unless you have the exact controller they used to develop this game you're in for more frustration. Besides controllers unquestionably lack in control and precision compared to a keyboard/mouse in a FPS. Take the advise from the negative reviews and stay the hell away from the P.C. version. Go WII or Cube or whatever except this PC slop. I'm going to buy the Wii version. It's cheap enough and the game does look like it might be interesting. A pox on UBI, money grubbing scoundrels that they are."
2,Squeegee part not so good,"I was pretty thrilled to see this product get good reviews and was extremely hopeful that this squeegee wouldn't suck like the other one I bought. But lo and behold: the squeegee is horrible. This one seems to have really thick and hard rubber that doesn't streak away the water very evenly since it can't contour to the surface I'm scraping. Additionally, the cut or mold isn't very straight, and so it only streaks away water in the middle of the blade. I wanted to like this product, and would have loved it cuz everything else about it seems great, but the blade is the most important part of this product and it really failed miserably there. Could be mine is just defective, but just be cautious if you're considering this one."
2,Not user Friendly,The rubber part which is used for wiping out the water is very hard and the quality of the item is very bad compared to the price.
1,Poor quality,"Great idea, but poorly executed. The blade doesn't make full contact with the glass surface, only touches it in a few spots, so you wind up with streaks. Also, the handle collapses too easily."
1,Absolute junk,Terrible quality. The rubber is way too hard. I can barely scrub the water off my window. All it does it screech as I try to drag it across my windshield. Not worth the money. If anybody knows of a good quality squeegee please let me know!
2,"Small, compact and not good.",All I wanted was a nice portable squeegee to clean my rear window. Size and compactness is nice. The squeegee is too stiff and not flexible. Just not a great product.
1,Propaganda from the Croatian Ministry of Information,"This book is a part of the propaganda war waged by the former Tudjman government of Croatia. The reason it is out of print is probably that the current, democratic and less nationalist, government of Croatia is ashamed of the product.It has no academic value other than as an example of modern propaganda at its most blatant."
1,deeply disappointed,"I had some of this a few years ago and it was fantastic. I got six jars for my birthday and I doubt there were more than a few shreds in any of the jars. It tasted fine, but the texture was gone. I hope it was just a bad batch. I would not buy this product again."
3,Department 56 Snow Village Big League Sports,Nice addition to the collection. A bit overpriced in my opinion but the cheapest I was able to find. Excellent delivery.
5,GREAT TRIMMER,"I WAS A LITTLE LEARY OF THIS TRIMMER, BUT IT WAS CHEAP. I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH IT SO FAR. IT DOES A NICE JOB. HOLDS THE SHELL FIRMLY, CUTS GOOD, AND IS SMOOTH OPERATING."
4,Accutrimer,Set it up and the few cases I trimmed came out great. Have to use it more when I reload more ammo to get a better feel for it.
3,bio-wheel,"The product itself had two problems. Firstly, it was shipped in an envelope so when it arrived the plastic disc on the end of the wheel was broken. I was able to fix it with epoxy glue. But the reason I ordered the bio-wheel in the first place was that the one that came with the filter did not turn. It was not close enough to the water for the flowing water to make it spin. The same was true with the new wheel. I glued 4 slats made out of plastic equally spaced to the fins on the wheel. The added slats are about 1/8 in deep. Now it spins and works like it is supposed to.Interestingly, I also have a Penguin 100 filter for another aquarium, and it works fine out of the box."
2,Looked great...and thats where it ended,Bought this product looking for a leather case that I could clip to my belt and still have full functuality of my phone with the case remaining on. That's why this case looked great because it slides up with your phone and has an opening for the camera. BUT the thing slides OFF the phone sometimes when you are trying to slide your phone open (annoying) and my belt clip broke on the second day while walking acros the street :(It did come as described the case is actually two pieces that clips on your phone (one on front and one on back) and its like hard plastic material with leather finish.
2,leblanc metal flute cleaning rod,ordered leblanc metal flute clening rod...listed as new had no paint on end of rod like it was worn off...purchased on amazon.com one of their merchants....should not have been listed as new....
1,Pure Junk,Ditto to the other reviews. Misleading packaging. This is a worthless program that takes forever to load.
1,"Big Mistake - Poor functionality, inaccurate","Caveat Emptor - Buyer Beware! I regularly rely on Internet mapping programs (e.g., MapQuest, Yahoo Maps) and thought a personal computer based PC to PAD mapping tool would allow easy interface between address book locations (throughout the USA) and surrounding points of interest and other business locations. The write-up for Rand McNally StreetFinder looked like a perfect fit . . . and if the software actually worked as advertised, it would have been. Unfortunately, from initial problems with installation, through dozens of common address locations that the software could not find or map, to partial downloads to my Tero 600 - this is one of the poorest software investments I have ever made. Save your money and stick with downloading maps from the Web."
5,Finally Back in Print!,"This 1950's coaching classic is finally back in print! Ray Pelfrey played end for Coach Steve Owen (NOT ""Owens"" as the original hardcover book said) with the New York Giants in the early 50's, and wrote this book shortly after his playing days were over. It is an excellent examination of then-cutting-edge concepts in the passing game.An added bonus is the chapter on the Owen ""A"" formation, which includes the half-spin sweep series and some advanced passing concepts, which are not even included in Coach Owen's own book,My Kind of Football.So -- this is not the right book for those seeking modern Spread, Air Raid, or even Run & Shoot concepts -- but it is an excellent source of football knowledge for the true student of the game."
5,Comprehensive review of complicated war,"Clay Blair does excellent job of combining a lot of primary and good secondary sources like applebaum's south to the naktong, and creates a most important reference to the korean war."
5,The Forgotten War,"I was in the USAF during the Korean ""Conflict"" but was stationed at Thule AB, Greenland so was interested in reading more about it.The book is huge and very informative but goes into more detail than I need. If someone was stationed there they would understand the details and politics better. It is always amazing how many mistakes are made in war by both sides.However, I am enjoying the read and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the conflict."
5,A Great Buy,Buying a used book is always a worry...is it going to be in good condition..will it be marked in or torn...as this was a gift for my husband I wondered...but to my surprise and delight it is in perfect condition and it arrived in 2/3 days...needless to say my husband was so pleased with the book and could not believe it was used...will buy again for sure...nana
4,a qualified great accomplishment,"A very finely written book, that delves into the people that shaped the war. The first chapter, that deals with all the characters and events that broght about the demobilization of the armed forces after WWII is absolutely riveting. The final chapter on the settlement talks is also as comprehensive as any book on the subject that I've read. Throughout the book, there is great attention to all the figures that shaped the war. There is only one caveat. That is, the bulk of the book on the war itself, is a case of overkill. I literally found myself skimming parts, simply because it seemed like I had read it all before. While technially a great achievement. I think that a 500 page book, with the first and last parts left intact, may have had a greater impact. Nonetheless, this is a definite must read on this war."
3,Biased reporting.,"I found the book, aside from an extremely detailed assimilation of events, to be interesting. Again, aside from his total BIAS against President Truman it was entertaining! I, however would not waste my time reading further books by this author!"
2,Mediocre.,"Where should I begin? I bought this as a fun CD to keep in the car for vocal excercise, but wound up becoming disappointed with the quality of the selections. First of all, the instrumentation and sound quality are poor... It sounds as if the entire album was cut on a keyboard, drums too. And if that weren't enough, a few of the songs are inexplicably truncated, such as ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant."" And then there are the background vocals. Horrid... The background vocals on ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" are almost comical. You'd think for the cost of this cd you'd at least get a more polished product. The album does a bunch of songs justice but the same can't be said for some of the well known hits on the album. Buy with caution."
3,The best was yet to come,"This young and budding group still unsure of their future elected to use the acronyms MJQ (Modern Jazz Quartet, Milt Jackson Quartet) under the Prestige label. Atlantic, taking the reins, soon catapulted this fascinating group to be the best jazz ensemble (Miles, notwithstanding) that ever was. No more than three stars, however, since the group had yet to come unto it's own. Roll over Beethoven!"
4,The end of an era,"While the finale leaves a bit to be desired (in my opinion), The rest of season 8 really bring a nice end to W&G. Fave episodes of mine in season 8 are: von trapped, the live premiere and the latter live episode, and of course, the britney episode. I highly recoment to any dedicated fan, time to say goodbye to our fave four!"
1,Grace is so Needy!,Well I've had this series for several months now and haven't made it past disc two. Maybe I've burnt out or maybe it's just the same old thing. I'm really upset that I'm not enjoying this season as much as the others. :(
5,Will and Grace final season DVD,This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas. The item was received in a timely manner just like I was promised. My daughter is a big fan of the series and this is the only one she needed to complete the entire series. The look on her face was priceless when she opened it.
3,I misread this DVD,I thought this was the Will and Grace box set but actually season 8 so was very disappointed and plus it was region 2 which I didn't understand so I resold here on amazon as a box set and another person was duped and emailed me telling me this was only season 8 the best part of this transaction was the seller always returned my emails and was wonderful to deal with and would definately deal with him again as the situation was completely my fault. Thanks mark for your understanding!
4,Will and Grace Season *,"This season in basically in line with the quality of the rest of the seasons.We were given closure in that the future was projected and we see the characters basically ride off into the sunset. The production of it was tad cheesy and predictable, but it's a sit-com so what did I expect??I was still sad to see the series end, I do enjoy watching this one."
5,East & West Coast performances,"Quick question:Will they include both east & west coast versions of the 1st episode and the one that takes place in Karen's bathroom (not sure which episode that is).Hopefully the producers won't decide for the viewers which episode is the ""official"" version, rather include both versions for the hilarious subtleties."
4,The final silly season,"There' no argument that this is one of the funniest series of all time, but season 8 was slightly ruined by what is one of the worst finales ever. It seems to have been written by people who've never watched the show and it's a completely unrealistic end to these characters (there's no way Will and Grace would stop talking to each other for so many years).Still, for a fan of the series and especially for those with the other seasons on DVD, this is a must-get. It has a few funny episodes (although this is probably the weakest season of all), and the bloopers are always a good addition to the set."
4,Will and Grace Season 8,Funny as ever! I was sad to see the series end. It was like saying goodbye to a group of close friends. (corny I know..but true)
4,"Kawasaki 840067 3.5-Amp Variable Speed Jig Saw, Black",Great price on this saw from Amazon (as usual) and a very good product. I would recommend it.
4,Jig Saw,Changing blade too complex and the holes in the blades are at the edge of the blade grip so are weakened
5,Bluegrass sad love song singing,"James King told me that his version of Hazel Dickens 'Just a Few Old Memories' was Dolly Parton's favorite. James King reaches deep into America's Bluegrass tradition to find tearful love songs that he sings with his tenor Bluegrass sound. A former U.S. Marine, he uses his strength of character to sing sad love songs about broken hearts with the inflection that only a spurned lover could feel.The musicians backing King play with feeling and percision and provide subtle harmonizing to complement King's strong tenor. - 2000"
5,Nice mix of bluegrass picking and Country soul,"James King is currently one pof my favorite bluegrass singers, a traditionalist with a nice ear for new tunes. This was the album that really turned my head in his direction... It's a great record, with a couple of brief lulls, but it mainly packs a real wallop. I particularly like King's ability to dip into George Jones-ish heartsongs, notably on his version of Hank Cochran's ""It'll Be Me,"" as fine a tribute to Ole Possum's country crooning as anyone might ask for... The picking on here, courtesy of Dudley Connell, Tom Adams and others, is also mighty fine. A really nice record... recommended!"
4,Nextar C3 review,"I purchased the Nextar C3 for our recent trip to Florida(3/20/08 - 3/27/08). My Father in law had a Nextar P3. When I saw the bargain price for the C3 I bought that instead. The Nextar worked great for our trip to Florida and is still working great. I Know it's not as fancy as Garmin or Magellan, but for $115 bucks I'm very satified. Just type in the address and off you go."
3,"good gps,but lacking","This gps is a good low end.It does not recoginize all areas of my route.For a starter gps it works fine,but it should be able to update and does not have that option."
2,Stop working after three months,"I purchased this navigation system based on all the great reviews. It arrived in perfect condition. Unfortunately, after using it about 6 times in 3 months, the unit suddenly stop working -- When it was turned on, the GPS just go frozen at the loading screen, stopped at 10% of the loading bar and won't go on.I contacted Nextar via their 1-888 number, and the only thing to do was return it for repair. SO I had to spend money to send the unit into Nextar for repair, and they said that the estimated repair time will take approximately 6 weeks after they receive it.Maybe you can think about it - IF* you don't mind to take the risk of lost your direction in the middle of trip* you are willing to take the trouble of returning and waiting* you can drive without a GPS for about two months(or more - who knows)."
1,How can they expect you to wait 4 months for replacement part?,"Purchased in August, this unit came with a defective car adapter cord. In other words, you are fine until the rechargeable battery gives out-- you will have directions for the first 2 hours of your trip only !!According to their 800 number, the car adapter cord is still on back-order due to high demand. So they continue to sell new units, presumably with car adapter cords that work, but can't replace loads of defective ones. Weird. If you will only use the Nextar unit for very short trips, give it a try."
4,Great for the price,"The Nextar C3 works as good as I expected for the price I paid ($149). I will recommend it. I had it for 3 months got to move from Tennessee to upstate New York. The directions were right all the way up and I been using it to get around in my new state and no problems so far.PROS:-Price-Size-It acquires satellites faster than my Garmin.-Usually gets me within 10-20 feet of my destination, if the destination is in the map.-More stuff than you need like a remote control and mp3 player.CONS:-***The maps seem to be about 2 years old. I was living in a 2 year old development and the Nextar C3 kept telling me I was off road.-The lighter power cable is to stiff; I wish it had a straight cable instead of a phone cord looking one. It pulls on the device and I'm afraid it might break the plug in. So I only use it to recharge The charge lasts for about 6 hours of continuous use."
3,Cheap - needs work,"PROS:* Cheap!* Destination calculations fast.* Good maps (but questionable ""best-path"" calculations)CONS:* Street name labels only appear at a zoom level that is too zoomed in. (This to me is unacceptable because the resolution is clearly available to draw the names).* When the map says you are at a cross street you have already passed it. (This is true at >30mph) - One-refresh predictive positioning would solve the problem.* Slow to acquire satellites"
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE 159.00,SO FAR SO GOOD THIS IS A GOOD GPS FOR THE PRICE. PAID 159.00 AT AMAZON DIRECTIONS ARE LOUD AND THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS GREAT.
1,worked 4 times then went haywire,Worked great for about 4 trips then went nutty and broke. Just after the 30 day return window of course. Just buy a garmin or tomtom.
3,"Good product, poor service","I really liked the GPS unit, however the car power cord was defective. I requested a new one from Nextar and they agreed to send one out. After 2 weeks, I called only to learn that they are having difficulty with the company that handles the power cords and Nextar doesnt know when they will receive another supply. Therefore, I have no car charger. I requested to return the GPS and get a new one, but was refused. I am stuck with a GPS unit that has no charger for the car. Poor customer service!!!!"
2,Has software issues,"You are better off spending more money and buying a GPS of a different brand that will actually last longer and doesn't have built in software problems. I bought one of these and used it for about a month during which it worked fine, until one day it suddenly froze and kept giving me a ""fatal application error"" message. I had Amazon replace it with a new one. The new one has worked for 4 months, until now when it has developed the exact same problem and keeps giving me a ""fatal application error"". Buying this unit has been a waste of my money, and the fact that the second unit they sent me developed the same problem shows that this GPS is simply not well made. As another reviewer mentioned the vehicle power cord is also defective. Mine literally fell apart the minute I took it out of the packaging and I am still waiting for the company to send me a replacement."
5,Great Item at a Great Price,"When I first got this device, I was kind of worried because it wouldn't acquire any GPS satellites, even after a complete full charge of the device. But for some reason after a couple of hours it started working perfectly fine. Now, after starting it up after it has been off for a while it takes less then 60 seconds, and that's in the house. I would definitely recommend this device to someone who is looking for a good device at a good price.PROS*Great Sized, Clear Touch Screen, StylusVery intuitive and easy to useMaps are pretty accurate and has plenty of POIsSmall and PortbaleVoice PromptedRechargebale BatteryPrice$$$So many different settings you'll go crazyCONS*After initial charge and first use, finding a GPS signal may take a very long time, but it will eventually.Doesn't say street names, which isn't really that big of a dealDoesn't have the absolute best GPS chipset as I have read"
4,Great for the price,"This has become my favorite new gadget. I have no doubt that a pricier GPS would have more and better features, but this one had the best price when I was searching, and does the job. I would prefer longer battery life (but it comes with car adapter so no problem), and it took a while to figure out how to persuade it that I wanted to bypass New York City via the Tappan Zee Bridge, but getting verbal directions beats the hell out of trying to read a map in the dark."
3,nextar C3,i ordered this product (3 of them) and it showed it came with a remote control but when it arrived it did not have one and there was no way to contact the shipper other than that i was pleased
1,Did not work when received.,I purchased this for my wife for Christmas. Upon opening the box and following instructions for charging the battery I found that the battery was defective and would not hold a charge. I did a lot of research for a gps and liked the reviews about the C3 and would buy it again. My mistake was to order a refurbished unit. They aren't worth it. Buy a new one. I had to pay to have the unit shipped back which means I'm paying more than advertised and I've lost money.
5,Original instrumentals that were hits,This is wonderful full orchestra sound. These conductors made the original recordings. Many times later groups just can't quite capture the exuberance of the first edition. Here you get a cross section of sound because it is not one orchestra playing all the songs. At the time of this review the price is about $70. I bought it for far less and have enjoyed it for years. A good price would be around $30.
2,Cheapo Chinese product,"This has nothing to do with the seller, of course. I should have realized that, at this price, the product would be mediocre. Lesson learned but can't you hit a great deal once in a while?? Having said that, the seller got this to me in a very fast manner. Good on them! However, damn this is a cheap little flashlight. Yuck. Unscrew the bottom to put in some batteries and you'll see that the threads barely match up. Be careful! You'll strip the threads if you aren't careful and render it useless.Same goes when putting a red lens on it. Careful. There are plastic 'washers' where we are usually used to seeing rubber O-Rings for weather sealing. at $4 a piece you just have to be careful. That's my take on these lights. Next time I'll have to spend more and get something that can handle as hard as I play. If you're military this is not the light for you."
3,need lenses,"mine shipped without two of the four lenses only received red and blue and was packaged terribly, will never buy rothco again"
2,It is small,"The model is small - maybe 6"". Skeleton does not run through his whole body - feet and hands are solid plastic. The arm and leg bones just loosely sit inside the clear plastic body frame and don't even attach to rest of body. Nevertheless, helpful to hold and examine the muscle side, but skeleton side is not completly accurate."
3,"Small but effective, not the most stable.","The figure is certainly small. As far as using it to learn major muscles go, It's great. I find the muscles to be very accurate and very helpful in assistance, the small size isn't a big deal. As for learning the bones, because they are inside of the nerve half of the figure, It's hard to see them and not really beneficial unless you want to take it apart every time. The left arm (the nerve arm) is very loose on my figure and constantly seems like it's going to fall off. However, because it's helped me with muscles midterm and final so well, I find these faults very easy to look past. A great educational tool, just don't expect it to be the sturdiest."
1,Frustrated,"I am disappointed with this model. It is very flimsy and difficult to put together. Constantly had a piece fall off while trying to put another piece on. Attempted to hold model together by using glue, still had difficulty. The frustration is not worth the price. Sorry."
2,TYPICAL T and A KILLER FLICK,"Bikini Island is your typical low budget T & A killer flick, with plenty of excuse to put women in skimpy bathing suits and make them do ridiculous poses. The characters in the film are amazingly stupid in not noticing that something fishy is going on. But don't blame them, blame the scriptwriter. The most ridiculous death scene--- some guy suffocated by a plunger while he was in the shower. Is that possible! Anyway have the remote handy so you can speed the film up to get to the good parts. The ending was absolutely ridiculous....it trivializes all the killings that went on."
5,A Must-Have!,"This set presents a deliciously balanced mix of up- and down-tempo latin-flavoured music. I bought the set banking on the presence of soild artists I already knew of, like Zuco 103 and Da Lata, but was also pleasantly surprised by unfamiliar artists such as Stereo Maracana.Great turned up at a party, or turned down for a study session or chill event. I liked this set enough to start slowly amassing all of the other CDs in the Brazilectro series.... they're all absolutely worth having."
2,Sad Sophie,I am sorry to say that this cute doll just isn't quality. My 2 year oldcarried her around for three days and the arm fell out of the doll and is made in a way that it can't be placed back on.I would have returned it but it was given as a gift and 2 year old children don't like to return gifts.Also the face is a peach like fabric which does not clean at all. Within no time she had stains on her face that can not be removed.So this doll was played with for a short period of time then put on a shelf awaiting the time when she can be disposed of without notice.
3,"Still good, Smitty","I'm not really too keen on all the songs on this album, but it seems a good reflection of Michael W. Smith's maturity. After 20+ years as a recording artist, he has earned the right to offer up an album where he can have a crack at worship.Track 4, however, is a real Smitty jem. How To Say Goodbye, inspired by taking his daughter to college, is excellent. Lyrics, voice and music combined into a classic Michael W. Smith masterpiece."
3,Stand,"While the CD Stand has some nice music, it is not as enjoyable as the CD Glory. I do listen to it but not as much as Glory."
2,Really Disappointed,I am a huge Smitty fan. I've gone to several of his concerts and have most of his CD's. Stand was very disappointing. I think it was due to the fact that MWS didn't write all the songs. Also there are a lot of repetitive lyrics as also noted by other reviewers.
3,Kind of boring!!! (Strictly a Musician`s Point of View),"Michael W. Smith`s music is famous for his smart, catchy and creative musical ideas. Now that`s gone. You listen the first song, then you`ve listened it all. Very similar harmonies!. I think ""loose"" is the best word to describe it.Now, i rated it 3 stars because it is an album for reflection (and 2 stars looks like junk, which is not!). So, if you want to have fun, probably you will be dissapointed (or asleep). But if you want it to have a worship moment, this record will work fine. Sincerely, i hoped this cd would be far better than Healing Rain, but you find more musical surprises in HR than Stand.I would love to tell what are the best songs, but, i barely can difference one song of each other!!!Huri"
3,good but not great,It does not hold a candle to the WORSHIP album. That album has the power of the Holy Spirit upon it.
5,Scooby-Doo/Scooby Doo2 movies,"I couldn't find it at the stores like wal-mart and target. I have a 2 year old daughter who likes the dog in the movies, so I went to amazon to find it and what do ya know, they had both movies together for the price of one, the shipping was fast and the movies played that's everything I wanted. Thanks!"
5,it was really good my grandkids loved it,i would recommend it for any one with kids it is really goodmy grandkids loved it i will purchase more movies it is so easy
5,Very good,These movies are fun to watch. They keep you wanting to know what is going to happen next. When there is nothing on tv or I dont know what to watch I put these movies on.
4,Need to indicate both sides of DVD play,"I ordered the Double Feature Scooby-Doo movies for my son for Christmas. He tells me that there is only one movie (the first one). I thought that must be a mistake. So I tried everything. Checked to see if there were two discs; there was only one. Checked the disc menu; it was for only one movie. Skipped through the scenes to see if the second one would start only after the first had finished (I was trying everything). Finally, I tried the other side, and there it was. Need to indicate that both sides of DVD work."
2,This set contains only Full Screen Films,"Just a warning to consumers:This set is full screen, not the 1.85:1 widescreen that is listed. This is exactly the same as the previously released double feature, just with a different cover.And I don't get it--the majority of folks who watch DVDs have wide screen TVs these days--""standard"" tvs are getting hard to even find in stores! It's almost 2010 for crying out loud--why, do manufacturers even produce ""standard"" versions of films that were originally wide? Now THAT's a mystery!ps--I should point out that EVERY online store, including the online Warner DVD store itself, lists the incorrect aspect ratio info on this item. I tried to get this corrected on Amazon, but since I couldn't find a url to attach, they wouldn't change their listing. (Even though I have a copy of the actual dvd in my hand right now and it says very clearly ""Full Screen Version""). That's progress for you)."
2,Not the best recording of this opera,"I'm not sure if it's the engineering or the reproduction, but the voices on this recording sound thin and tinny. I have the Solti recording too, and the sound reproduction seems much better."
3,"Not bad, but...","This set is basically a collection of Sherlock Holmes films that are in the public domain. The visual quality is somewhat faded on several of the films and the sound is adequate at best. However, even with these liabilities, the films are viewable. Included in the set is the following:4 films with Basil Rathbone:- Terror by Night- Woman in Green- The Secret Weapon- Dressed to Kill3 films with Arthur Wontner:- Triumph of Sherlock Holmes- Murder at the Baskervilles- Sign of FourThe other films are:- Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace (Christopher Lee)- A Study in Scarlet (Reginald Owen)- The Speckled Band (Raymond Massey)There are also five episodes from the 1950s Sherlock Holmes TV show with Ronald Howard as a bonus feature. Aside from the popular Basil Rathbone movies, what makes this set interesting is the inclusion of other lesser known films that have just recently been made available."
3,Nicely done but not very useful.,"This book gives a great overview of the various digestive maladies (and how there is no cure for most of them). But I cannot imagine anyone who has a reason to buy this book not knowing (1) they should avoid coffee & greasy/spicy food, (2) try to relax and (3) get plenty of excercise.As W.C. Fields opined, ""There's only one cure for insomnia; get plenty of sleep!"""
3,Delightful!,"When I started reading this book, I thought with a disappointed sigh that this was going to be another run-of-the-mill western historical romance. A cultured east-coast woman travels to the untamed west and hooks up with a roughened mountain man, and the unlikely couple must find common ground before they can find love. What set this story apart was the beautiful way it was written. The romance came alive off the pages, and Buck's tenderness and vulnerability really shone through. There was a bit too much unnecessary verbal sparring and I could have done without the detailed descriptions of his hunting/skinning work, but all-in-all it was an enjoyable story."
5,"Durable, pretty, however, a copy!","This doll has the looks of a celebrity,however, two slight mistakes. 1. She is a copy of the Funk n Glow line 2. Dana could have a longer skirt. Despite these mistakes, she is a beautiful doll. Thank-you, MGA, for this beautiful toy!"
3,Good Doll...but...,"OK. Here's the thing. There's nothing wrong with this doll, but doesn't anyone else think Dana's ripping off Meygan? First it was Funk n GLow, then it was the Sweet Heart collection..and then...ugh I can't remember...but it seems like Dana is ripping Meygan off!!! Come on people!"
2,WEEEE! no it's actually backwards. EWWWW is more like it!,wow. I can't believe how many people were disapointed about this dana doll. Actually I wasn't surprised cuz I'm one of those people. I think this doll's clothes are too plain and MGA just can't add a feather boa to make her clothes more exciting. The feather boa lookes like its attacking her! Though one good thing about this dana doll is I like her hair and her face is pretty. But what's with the cowboy hat?
4,"Good Doll, Bad Moral Values","OK: I KNOW WHAT MEYGAN LOOKS LIKE. BUT I JUST THOUGHT THAT MGA WAS TRYING TO ""REPLACE"" MEYGAN IN EVERY COLLECTION SHE'S IN WITH DANA. THAT'S ALL. No offense to this doll. I mean, come on! It's a decent doll. Give it a break."
4,Wasabi peanuts,These wasabi peanuts are much spicier than I had expected so a few go a very long way. Great for quick snack or with cocktails before dinner. Recommend storing in airtight container to keep fresh.
2,Meh...,"I frequently buy wasabi covered peanuts at Fresh Market, here in Miami. They really have a cult like following according to employees at the market. I was excited to see that I could order wasabi peanuts, and avoid going to Fresh Market, where I would inevitably buy some fancy cheese or other unnecessary gourmetish item.When I received the peanuts today, I gleefully told everyone at the office how delicious they would be. The other attorneys in my office now consider me a dishonest person. Due to these peanuts, and my statement about their deliciousness, I have been branded a liar.Most of the reviews mention how hard the peanuts are. That is what I like about the Fresh Market peanuts, the crunchiness. These have similar crunch, but the flavor is very chemical. Although the crunchiness is similar, there is something about the texture I can't put my finger on. I won't be ordering these again. I'll be buying them at Fresh Market."
3,"Spicy! Hard as rock, too salty.","I had delicious wasabi peanuts a long time ago. These are not as good as I remember. As another reviewer mentioned, the quarter-inch rice coating on these is rock-hard. It doesn't get any softer if you suck on them a couple seconds. A couple seconds of sucking is painful! The (wasabi and salt) force is strong in these, but it doesn't exactly taste high-quality.The coating almost looks like styrofoam, which disturbed me until I read the ingredients on here. It would be nice if Sweet Gourmet included a slip listing ingredients. Also, as mentioned, shipping is high, but other vendors are even more. The price was fine, but I'd like a thinner, more appetizing coating, better wasabi, and information included on ingredients and quality of ingredients."
3,Kind of let down by the quality.,Both bags were old and stale and crushed. I get these at a local bar and they are much better there.
3,Meh.,"Not bad, but also not good. They have a weird aftertaste and are SUPER crunchy (like a corn nut). I also bought some Wasabi peas, and I mix the two and that helps a bit with the aftertaste. I think next time I will probably just get the more expensive brand just so I know what I am getting."
2,Disappointed,"I was contemplating about giving this a one star, but they did give me pre-prepaid label to return it.I ordered this product and was looking forward to enjoying them, i opened the box and the peanuts at the bottom and on top were crushed. They didn't even put a bubble wrap to protect it, i wonder who's in charging of shipping. I ordered this product from a different vendor and it came perfectly, unfortunately i forgot the name of that vendor."
2,Cheap Wrist Band,Bad Quality. I really loved this watch when I first got it. The watch itself can take a beat since its a G-shock. Unfortunately the plastic/rubber used for the wristband is cheap and starts cracking after about a year of use and a few months after that it cuts out completely.I bought a replacement wrist band from Casio and got it back to its original shape but exactly the same thing happened after a year with the replacement wristband. So they seem to be all the same cheap material.My older G-shock lasted 4+ years with no problems.These Made in Indonesia Casio don't seem to be on par with the quality of the old Made in Japan G-shock Casio.
2,Own this for at least 3-4 years,"I am an outdoor and practical person so when I saw this watch I thought, this is it. Maintenance free watch, no battery needed, the watch adjusts itself to the Colorado atomic clock. I bought it assuming I don't need to buy anymore watch. I was wrong, 6 months ago, this watch is off by 5 minutes faster and it's been like that since then. I tried to sync it but it doesn't make a different. Note: warranty is out so I cannot take it to casio for repair (free). I figure getting a new one is cheaper anywayI am used to it by now but I'll replace it eventually when I have extra money. I really love the concept of this watch but I don't know if the other ones would be the same or they have fixed the issue."
4,Bargain basement,"Pros: Atomic, analog digital, Solar, tough, etc. I'm a computer technician and I need a tough watch; I have a different model that I need to get the battery changed out it is three years old and still going. This same watch is going for $40 to $70 more at discount retail stores! The light display is cool.Cons: The hour hand is red. Why??? Would give it a five if hour hand was normal.Still you can't beat the price for a cheap solid atomic time-keeping and solar powered watch."
3,G-Shock Solar Atomic watch,"The watch is surprisingly light for it size. It is very accurate. I have worn it while doing yard work including operating a chain saw, and it has not missed a beat. I highly recommend this watch.I am revising the comment on accuracy. The watch seems to run consistently about eight minutes slow in the analog mode, although the smaller digital clock is right. There does not appear a way to adjust the analog time."
5,Great watch.,I love this watch. The recessed crystal protects it from getting all scratched up and the atomic time keeping function is great. I had a model almost identical to this for years and had no problems with it until I lost it so I had to replace it with the closest thing I could find. Great value on Amazon.
4,good bang for the buck,"I was in the market for an every day beater. Saw this watch at the company I work for at a cost of $[...]. liked its features and thought it looked alright. fits well on my 7"" wrist and its light enough to not really notice. the illumination is lame on the dials, but its got two led lights. I like it. and for [...] bucks shipped I'd buy it again."
5,Excellent Lifetime Watch.,"This is the best product I have purchased yet at Amazon. Am very happy with the watch. Read all the reviews from other users and decided to buy it last week. Can't tell you how much I am loving it already. Shipping was on time and the watch is par excellence!! You can't beat the price on Amazon. You will never need to buy another watch again nor worry about changing the time or changing the battery + 2 year warranty.. al for under $60. Believe me this is really the ""gift that keeps on giving""!!!!"
3,Not close to 47mm description is wrong,"It's a Casio G-Shock. I think that should about cover it. Anyone who has owned one will tell you just how reliable and accurate they are.I owned another one of these but with the ss bracelet and case. I gave that one to my son.I missed it so much that even though I own many other watches I had to have another one. There is a substantial difference between the ss version and this one,but it is hard to find that one anymore. I would caution that if the alarm is important to you, find another model. This will do just fine as an all around outdoor watch for me until I can decide which Pathfinder I want."
4,Nice watch for the price paid,"This is a very nice watch filled with the all the features that one can ask for from a wrist watch with this price. And it also carries name of Gshock. What else do you want?I like everything about this watch, it synchronizes with atomic watch so no need to adjust, different timezones, alarm, stopwatch, nice look etc etc etc.The only thing I would like to suggest to casio is size. They should work little on size of the watch because if you are wearing full sleeve T/shirt then this watch is very noticable under your sleeve.But overall I am very satisfied with the watch."
3,all functions,alarm does not work have not found one that works in the 10 different ones tried. non at walmart worked world
4,It was a gift,This was a gift for my son-in-law. He has another G-Shock Ana-Digi Solar Atomic watch that wasn't keeping accurate time so this was a replacement. No word as of yet as to the accuracy of this watch so that could be a good thing.
2,"Great, if only it lasted more than 2 years!","While it lasted, it worked great. The Atomic timekeeping, solar was fantastic, and the watch itself quite rugged. Unfortunately, after slightly more than 2 years (was a birthday gift June 2006), it started acting up. First, the auto-light sensor stopped working. The LCD portion has lost one segment, so it is very hard to read. Then, more seriously, the watch's atomic receptor stopped working, failing every time I try to get a new sync. Worse yet, it now resets itself to 1/1/2000 every night. The whole reason I bought this was to have it last for a long time. It is out of warranty, and I'm not about to throw good money after bad, especially after reading about other people's bad service experiences."
2,For the price Im not that happy,"Ive had this G shock about a year and a half now. Seems like every 6 months something starts to go wrong. At first it was the LED to light the face at around 6 months. Since the hands are luminous I decided I could live without it because sending it in is a pain. Then at about a year it would stop keeping analog time if I took it off and the watch sat a temp. lower then about 80 degrees. I had to reset the analog time almost daily. It was out of warranty at this point, I called and casio told me it would cost me $60 to fix it. I was not doing that. Now, the reset for the analog hands does not work, so Its just got digital time now. When I bought this thing I wanted an all black, tough analog watch that would last a while. So much for that. The digital features and the self updating time have been great, but a year and a half into ownership the hands dont work, cant be set and you better light a match if you want to see what time it is in the dark: Buyer beware."
2,This is for kids or teenagers. Not for adults.,PROS: Great looks and functionalitiesCONS: Looks good on people with small wrist or Kids. Will Not recommend this for adults.
2,Not Very Good Watch,"Pros: Easy-to-read analog timeNice featuresNice strapVery toughCons: VERY hard to read at nightTeeny screen that displas the featuresHard to use features at nightVERY VERY VERY hard to set hands -took me 3 months to figure out how-Bad customer service at CasioNot very good lookingBottom Line: Okay watch, but bad design"
5,Spectacular!!!!!,"It is elegant, reliable, solid and very appropriate for work or casual wear. The battery is long-lasting and is very easily charged with any kind of light. Time is set automatically wherever you are. Besides, I can practice my water sports with the utmost confidence. And what I like the most are the outer glass cover and frame which protect the watch from hits and scratches.To sum up, you can wear it in almost every ocassion and look good at the same time."
5,Good product,This product was very easy to set up and only took a couple minutes to install. It was very easy to use and the office staff loves the way it works! The only 'problem' may be that I might have to get more!!It shipped in quick time and came faster than I thought it would!!
4,"Great product, light but a little loose on the ear",Product works well and is easy to install and use. Very light but a little loose on the ear. Overall very well worth the price.
2,Doesn't charge reliably,"Mostly a great headset, but it is very tempermental to get seated properly (i.e., to get it to charge). I have long known that I need to watch the blinking light to be sure it is charging. However, lately it has been getting worse -- it will blink a couple of times but then stop charging (I think the little plastic spring that holds it in the cradle actually pushes it off the contacts unless you get it seated just right). I now watch it for a while and monitor it to be sure it continues to charge. I just took another conference call on the handset because it didn't recharge after this morning's call so I am a little steamed. I might have given it 3 stars if I was writing a review out of boredom (it is comfortable, has good range and the sonic quality is pretty good), but I don't enjoy having to pay attention to a cordless headset."
5,hearing well,We have employees that need to get up and move around while still talking and also one who is hearing impaired and this device works well for all of them.
3,Plantronics CS70N/HL10Wireless Office headset,"I'm disappointed in this unit. Callers have told me that I sound like I'm coming from the ""bottom of a deep well"" when in use. The ear piece is VERY uncomfortable -- especially if you wear glasses!"
4,Headset Purchase Worth While,"Purchased the headset to have the ability to roam my office and stay hands free. Meets all expectations. It occasionally has an ""echo"" but that seems to be fixed by adjusting the ear piece. I would recommend this to a friend!"
1,Not happy at all with the way it fits on the ear annoying,Not happy at all with the Plantronics CS70N wireless headset. Extremely uncomfortable to wear o the ear. Not happy with it at all[...]
4,Plantronics CS70 Headset System,I bought the Plantronics CS70 headset system at the recommendation of my Hosted VoIP provider. The headset is connected to a Polycom IP450 in my home office. This is my primary work location. I use it every day.The call quality is excellent; and it is a very comfortable headset (I forget I have it on sometimes).I am disappointed with the limited range - I cannot go from one of the house to the other; or outside.I have not been able to get the HL10 lefter accessory to work correctly with the Polycom IP450.
1,No no no,"Yes, this headset works just fine. No problem there. Good range. Clear calls. But this is a business system, and it's terribly unfriendly for business users.The CS70 battery lasts maybe a year. After that, you cannot replace the battery. You have to send it in to Plantronics, and they send you a replacement headset for $100. Complain and they'll send you to another department where you can get the $50 replacement (refurb!). The Plantronics site makes no mention of the non-replaceable battery, and if you're a small business, this becomes a painful added expense.Instead, get the CS500 series. The headset itself is half the weight, lots more confortable, has a replaceable $10 battery, AND it's the same price as the CS70. My company just dumped a dozen CS70 units and replaced them with the CS540. The sales staff love them, and I love that I'm not having to play games with Plantronics' customer service."
5,Very Satisfied,"We ordered only a few to try out in our office and the whole staff found the headset to be very comfortable and clear. Needless to say we now have them thruout our whole office and everybody is very happy. The only con on the item would be it is a little tough plugging in the handset to the base, but the rest is very easy and only took about 2 minutes to hook up.Our old headsets were over 20 yrs old and were Plantronics and held up well, it was time to update and are very happy we did. I highly recommend this item."
1,Very Limited Range - Very expensive,"These untis are extremly expensive, the battery life is subpar (I had to buy a second expensive headset to make it through my meetings), the mute button is hard to work and if/when you find it try to quickly unmute to speak in a meeting good luck. But even with those irritating issues I would have given this a better rating, but the range that this unit allows you to wander from the base unit is just sad at best. I might was well use a corded phone, the minute I try to go to another room it immediately starts beep and breaking up on to the party on the other end of the call, and lets face it that is why you are buying a coodless head set so that you can leave the desk... Not good for home office folks."
4,Show tunes in Jazz!,"Mr. Baker equits himself handsomely performing jazz versions of these (mostly) well known songs from Broadway plays. The highlight is an eight minute version of ""On the Street Where You Live"" whic allows Chet to stretch out and play a little. Another excellent rendition is ""I've grown accustomed to her Face, which swings and has great accoustics. Good music, great trumpet playing."
4,Just for your information,"This little piece of history was recorded July 22, 1959 in NYC. Besides, Chet Baker the musicians included Herbie Mann, Zoot Sims, Bill Evans, Pepper Adams, Earl May and Clifford Jarvis, which is not bad company."
1,don't waste your money on this one,"The quality of the recording is terrible. At times, the solos are drenched in reverberation only to disappear in the middle of the solo..If you are a big Bill Evans fan, you may enjoy a few of his brief solos....definitely not one of Chet's finer recordings.."
5,Fan for life!!,"This movie is wonderful, from the beginning to the end. Matt Smith is great as the doctor and looking forward to more specials."
1,DVD vs Blu-ray Description Deception - Bad Amazon,"Let me start by saying that I love Doctor Who and although this isn't one of my favorite episodes, I'm not giving the 1-star for the episode (I'd give it a 3-star). I'm giving the 1-star for Amazon's deceptive product description for the DVD. Amazon's product description FOR THE DVD is as follows: ""Doctor Who Confidential - An inside look at the 2010 Doctor Who Christmas Special Doctor Who at the Proms - Concert performance of music from Doctor Who recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall during the BBC's annual Proms concerts.""Guess what's NOT on the DVD version? Yep, you guessed it, the Doctor Who Confidential. If the Confidential was only on the Blu-ray, then why was it listed in the production description for the DVD? I wouldn't have bought the DVD if I'd known that it wasn't complete with ALL the extras. Amazon, in the future, PLEASE don't put extras that are only on the Blu-ray version in the production description for the DVD version."
2,This ain't the Moffat we knew.,"While it took me a while to warm up to Matt Smith as the Doctor, I am still a little angry that Steven Moffat writes Doctor Who stories mainly for his children, hence most of what we have seen so far with Matt Smith features kids in the stories. This is not bad as long as it is not overdone, but, come one. This is not what we expected from the man who wrote such classics as ""The Doctor Dances,"" and the two-parter ""Silence In the Library.""I was quite disappointed in this years' Christmas Special and can't find anything nice to say about it. And, as a Doctor Who fan since 1986, it hurts me to say such a thing. Mr. Moffat, please leave the children out of your future Doctor Who stories."
2,Worst 11th doctor Story,"Okay, after the hitmiss season 6 I was looking forward to this thing hoping that Moffat got his act togather to give a good christmas episode like last year........I was wrongGood Points: Matt Smith (always fun to watch)Bad points: everything elseThe moralThe charctersThe Actingits badif you want a good doctor who christmas episode I recommed Christmas carolthis is bad3/10"
2,Expensive for less than 1/2 of pantyhose Runs easily. Harsh,"These hose are great for Summerlin, NV for church and dress up when it is way too hot for pantyhose. BUt the fabric is harsh, the elastic gives out rapidly, and runs appear for no reason. Way over priced for quality."
3,Sheer but delicate,"These are simply OK - not great, not bad. They don't last long - but that can be a perk with stockings, at least you don't have to toss the entire set so multiple's are needed for backup."
4,Hanes Silk Reflections,"I received these stockings quickly, along with another order. I like how these feel on my legs, very warm. They make my legs look nice also. A very good product, well worth the money."
1,Silicone a problem?,"I have had to rate these so low because after one wearing, I cannot wear them again. The hose were very comfortable, did not bind, and stayed in place. BUT, the next day I had itiching red welts all around my legs (corresponding to the silicone band)that took all week to subside. I cannot risk this allergic reaction again. This is very disappointing because I thought these would be a perfect solution to wearing hose and never panty hose again!Liz"
3,Hanes Style 720 Thigh-highs,"I bought a pair of navy blue ones for my wife, as they match the navy blue lingerie I got her. Navy blue is kind of a hard color to come buy for thigh-highs, and this seemed to be the best deal I could find. They look and feel pretty nice on her.I ordered the medium size, size C/D, and they seemed a little longer on her than I expected. But the only thing I really don't like is that the lace-top is only 1 1/2 inches. It always looks better when the lace top is about 3 inches, so hopefully hanes will soon offer a larger lace-top version of these."
3,OK Thigh High,I liked the Victoria Secret hoses much better but tried these Hanes. They were ok but I wouldn't buy them again.
1,"Awful, cheap.","Bought a few pairs. On one, the silicon rubber was already so bad they would not stay up. On the others, it got flabby within 3 or 4 wearings. But, that's not so bad... since they are so ridiculously thin and run so easily (I put socks over my nails when putting them on, so no, that's not it). These are really disposable 1 use stockings. Blech."
1,Poor quality,The hose I got had blemishes and imperfections in the hose that caused runs the minute you began to put them on. Very poor quality.
4,warning: no libretto,"This is a good recording, no doubt about it, but costumers should be aware of the fact that there is no libretto included, but only a detailed synopsis."
5,The best!,"This book is the best thing to read if you are thinking about getting into real estate on just about any level. It has, I think, all the info you need."
4,Best books,"Real estate investing is easy to understand guide for everyone..including those who dont like reading.Its a book when you pick you cant put it down untill you finish reading .... try it as I took risk to buy,,, but lucy for you , You are not taken risk to buy but by a recommendation. lucky for you"
1,Wasted my time...don't waste yours.,"Rich Dad Poor Dad was great...this is not.The title of this book is totally misrepresentative of the contents. This book is about buying huge apartment buildings all over the US. Not what I would call ABC's of real estate investing. Furthermore, if you are buying apartment buildings then you are probably too advanced for this book anyway.The book is very basic and is easy to read. If you just want to get excited about the idea of real estate investing jump in.If you want something to actually teach you about real estate investing grab a book like ""Investing in Real Estate"" by McLean and Eldred. Also check out the podcast ""Get Real, Real Estate Investing for the Rest of Us""."
4,Rich Dad Adopt ME !,An excellent read on multi-family and commercial real estate.Only 4 stars because it is really about the advanced investor in my opion. They deal more with apartment buildings and commerical where the math is critical before you buy. Only somewhat applicaple to a small rent house investor like I hope to become. But well worth the read. Very educational and informitive for the small investor as well.
3,Very focused on large apartment complexes,"Be aware that the author of this book is almost totally focused on how to buy and manage large apartment buildings. If you're looking for advice on investing in a single-family house or two, or a duplex, look elsewhere. In fact, the author scoffs at wasting your time on ""small"" investments like that.I wish I had realized how narrowly focused this book is on large-scale real estate investing. I would not have purchased it."
5,Great book.,This is an outstanding book for anyone considering real estate investments. I highly recommend it.
5,Detailed book on Real Estate Investing,This is definitely a very detailed book on real estate investing (especially residential real estate). Easy to read no unnecessary nonsense (just to fill up the book).You can definitely tell that this book is from somebody who is breathing and living real estate investing. And he is very detail oriented.
2,Shallow at Best,"This book was an easy read. Like the two other books that I just finished reading from the Rich Dad series, this one does not have much substance. This book does a great job of convincing the reader of how great real estate investing is. However, it is shallow and does not give enough advice on how to actually get started in real estate investing. Do not waste your time and money on this book!"
3,Good overview but short on the details,"This book is strictly about investing in rental properties. The author provides an overview of the process, but not much detail. I'd like to know how the author got started in real estate investing. What processes did he go through? How did he make his way to owning/managing million $ properties? This book is fine for a quick read which highlights the real estate investing process, but will leave you hanging if you want to become a serious investor."
4,Great for beginners,"After all its the 'ABC', for beginners. Would take a couple more books to get to 'XYZ'. Its great for those who are interested in the real estate investing and want to know what its about (this book only talks about rental apartments, not houses or condos). For people who are already in the business this book will only point out the obvious. It doesn't cover all of the aspects of real estate investing. Well, no book does. It serves more as a guide, touches on the surface of 1) finding deals, 2) how to investigate a property, 3) how to come up with the price of the property, 4) a little bit on how to manage rental apartments. It doesn't cover on other important topics such as 1) funding, bank loans, financing and morgaging your property 2) taxes and 3) market researching."
3,How to Analyze an Investment!!,"The book will guide you on the qualification of a good investement to cashflow based on the Net Operating Income, and also how to use the Letter of Intent to purchase."
4,Of great value,The book is very good. I think anyone with few or some experience in Real Estate will find this book be very valuable.
3,We'll talk about that later!,Author spends a lot of time telling you he will discuss it in a later chapter. Overall a decent book with relevent information.
2,Basic and Already Outdated,Both the mortgage and real estate markets have crashed since this was published. The game has changed. Find something more current to read.
5,The answer!,"If you are serious about investing in real estate,then this is the real estate ""Bible"" of investing."
2,Not a good book for beginners.,"The content of this book mainly deals with buying apartment buildings. Although this is a profitable way to invest in real estate, it is not a book for beginners. The author talks about how he and his company search many locals across the country in finding good deals. This does not apply to the new or relatively new investor who doesn't have the time or resources to search the country. Most new investors start with single family homes in their own neighborhood, and this book competely glosses over this starting point."
4,Good starting point,"It's an easy to read book with lots of information... Although McElroy talks a lot about apartment complexes, I suppose the same strategies could be applied to other types of properties. He explains how to find the right property in the right market, how to evaluate the property and calculate the right offer price, what to look for when you inspect the property, and how to manage it once you own it. The only thing he doesn't go into that I wish he did is financing. Otherwise he seems to have covered all the basics."
3,This is not a book about flipping properties,"As in all the Rich Dad series, yhome is still a liability. The only realestate that is not a liability is the one you are not personally using and the one that generates mor in rental income than your morgage. The book does have a few interesting usefull recomendations and scripts to use when looking at investment properties."
3,More Realistic View of Building Real Estate Wealth,This book has a lot of good examples of maximizing net income. This is a more realistic view of building real estate wealth and diminishes the claims of the get rich quick programs. Emphasizes the importance of research as well as how to spot potential 'surprises.'
3,Need more concrete answers,"Book is a good read, but I felt I needed more concrete answers to my questions. Maybe more strategies or specific steps to take in different scenarios.I have found another book that answered my questions and had more strategies to share.Bubble Proof: Real Estate Strategies that Work in any Marketby Tonja Demoff. Great read!"
4,Clear and Concise,This is a great book for explaining basic concepts of multifamily residential real estate and a framework for pursuing this type of assett.
4,Excellent How-To book on buying apartment buildings,"This is the first book in the Rich Dad series that actually tells you how to find, buy and manage apartment complexes. The author writes the entire step by step process of locating a good market and a good deal.The disadvantage is that the step by step process is written in paragraph form, not outline form, so that makes it a little harder to go back and find the step you are looking for after reading the book."
4,Great Start for New Real Estate Investors,"This book is a great first read for those who are looking to begin a career as a real estate investor. I am getting ready to begin real estate investing so this book was extremely helpful in giving me a clear overview of this business. I also appreciate how it was written in a way that was very easy to understand. This was also my first experience with any of the books from the Rich Dad series, and as a result I have read several other books from the series since."
2,did not like the smell,did not like the smell and don't recommend it for hot weather. Received it right away that was definetely a plus
1,Not good,"Thin, cheap plastic construction that will never stand up to squirrels for more than 5 minutes. Seeds tend to get trapped inside and birds will not be able to figure out how to get to them. Looks much better in the photo than it really is. It's really an indoor seed storage unit, not a bird feeder."
2,Cute bowls,"I bought this just to complete the set, but I have to admit it's not too practical being that it's metal. Plastic would be much more versatile. It is good to hold cookies though."
3,Good story - bad read,"I just finisher Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers and it was GREAT, a definite 5 star. Tomorrow's Treasure is my first Linda Lee Chaikin book and I'm on page-82 and stuggling terribly. Her writing is not nearly as smooth. I know there is a decent story somewhere in there - if I can just get to it. I gave the 3rd star because it's Christian but I do feel that it may not be worth more than 2."
2,"Be aware: This is Christian Fiction, Heavy on the Christian","I ordered this book because of the incredibly high ratings, but I guess I didn't read closely enough -- I had no idea I was buying a Christian book.I figured it out after about three chapters, much of which contained verse, which I thought was just part of the story, until it became very clear to me that this is a ""Christian Message Book."" Then I read the author profile in the book, which stated that the book was written for ""The Christian Market.""I am Jewish, and I am used to reading books that are about Christian people, but I was not interested in this kind of book.In it's favor, the premise of this book appeared promising, if a bit overly romanticized and ""sacharin-sweet."" The writing was good, although a bit formal at times.Mostly, I wanted to put in this review so that other potential readers would be aware of the nature of the book. If you appreciated this info, mark this review ""helpful,"" so it will be listed prominently."
5,Absolutely Perfect!!!!,"I have never rated a book online before beacuse no book has ever compelled me to like this one has. This was my first book to read by Linda Chaikin, but it will not be my last. This book gets your attention on the very first page and never lets you go. You will fall in love with the characters, the plot, everything about it. It has everything: adventure, suspense, mystery and most of all love. I did not want it to end. It is perfect."
4,Fits my 15-month-old perfectly and keeps her little neck warm!,"I have had one of these for myself for a long time, so I knew that they are great for keeping your neck warm without unravelling and falling off every two minutes like a scarf.I was hesitant to buy one for my 15-month-old baby in the kid's size because I was afraid it would be too big. I was wrong - it fits her perfectly! So much so, in fact, that I'm surprised that other reviewers say that they use them on older children. To me it looks like it would be too small for a 4-year-old, but I could be wrong.My baby doesn't love having it pulled over her head. If I could make one improvement (or if I were handy with a needle and thread) I would have it open on one side and close with velcro or something."
5,Great for kids in the wind and snow,"Two thumbs up from a 10-year-old girl who uses this as a staple of her winter wardrobe. Her nose and ears chill easily, but there are no complaints when she has her Turtle Fur warmer on board. She wears it high over her nose and mouth, leaving little exposed under her hood. She's used it down to six Fahrenheit and a stiff breeze and been comfortable on the slopes and her walks to school. It's too thick to do this during hard aerobic activity; at these times she pushes it down around her neck or takes it off until she settles down again."
5,nice product!,"I bought both of my kids (5 & 3 years old) this youth neck warmer and it is great! Soft and big enough that fits over head without too much pulling. My kids can be fussy about stuff, but I haven't had any problems putting this on either of them."
5,Jennifer Lopez ( If you have,Jennifer Lopez ( If you had my love)This import contains 6 songs and is its very nice .The songs are1. If you had my love/ Radio Edit 3:482.If you had my love/ Pablo Flores Remix Edit 3:553.If you had my love/Dark Child Remix Edit 4:004.If you had my love/Pablo Flores Remix 9:135.If you had my love/Dark Child Extended 6:036.No me ames ( duet with Marc Anthony/ Tropical Remix) 5:05
1,puzzling CD!,"I just wanted to ask the guy that wrote the review, what single is this?? As Jennifer doesn't have a single called ""My Love"". Is it a single for ""If You Had My Love"" or maybe ""Love Don't Cost A Thing""? And what tracks are on it? Your help would be much appreciated!"
1,Skip it!,"It's big but looks better on the box than in person. Took my eleven year old a day to build, now it just collects dust. If you want mine you can have it."
3,"Good info, disorganized book","There is a lot of good info in this book, but I find that I need to flip around too much and it is hard to read this book cover to cover. The author does share some ""try this"" instead examples which was very helpful, but it is hard to determine which chemicals are extremely bad, a little bad, etc."
5,The Perfect Consumer Guide,"As a consumer and someone who is passionate about the impact of ""ingredients"" on my health and the environment I found this book to be of great help in deciding what to buy and what to avoid. I highly recommend it!"
2,Flashy but insubstantial,"After reading some of Alan Moore's other superb works (the incomparable _Watchmen_ for example), I was looking forward to more of the same. Sadly, it just doesn't match up. The art is much more flashy and colorful, but aside from some clever heroes and one-liners in this book (including a particularly amusing side-track about colorblindness in canines), the writing just seems flat."
3,review of top 10 book 1...,"i was pretty disappointed with top ten book 1. it didn't do it for me at all. the characters were too shallow and formulaic. the story was unengaging. reading it felt like a big waste of time, and i love the author. this might be overly critical sounding, but its alan moore we are talking about. for a truly great recent moore work, try the league of extraordinary gentlemen instead.i was really impressed with top ten book 2 however. maybe the series just needed some time to get going."
4,Thelonious Waldron?,"The Mal Waldron Trio gets things cooking on this late 1950s recording. Not one of Mal's better known sessions, these tracks show why Waldron is heralded as one of the few inheritors of Monk's approach to structure and style. Three originals and three standards comprise this album, as well as a composition by Waldron's wife on ""All About Us.""Mal Waldron (piano)Addison Farmer (bass)Al ""Tootie"" Smith (drums)"
4,You don't know what your missing.,"I saw this originally back when it first played on tv. It was so good that I couldn't forget it and eventually had to find a copy for myself. The characters are rich and the story is fresh and unlike any other I have ever seen or read about. It's not in print, but if you can find a copy, you are not wasting your money to buy it."
4,It's this or $1000,"Yes, this scanner doesn't natively support OSX (toss out the software if you're a Mac user), but thanks to the SANE project, you can make it work as a native scanner. [...].As for the scanner, well there's really nothing else this cheap. If you don't have $1000+ to drop on an A3 scanner, this is your only choice. And for what it is it works well enough. Ive been able to scan up to 600dpi with decent results and that beats the heck out of stitching two scans together in Photoshop. And this updated version, for those who recall the previous Mustek/Marstek A3, has a USB interface instead of SCSI. Nuff said.Need A3 on a budget? This is your only choice. And I for one am thankful it exists. It does what it does well enough and it won't break the bank. But don't buy it and then cry that it doesn't look as good as a Canon 1680. It's $1200 cheaper! If you do have $1000+ to spend on a scanner, then stop reading. This scanner is not for you."
2,Useful but handle with care,"Do not use this scanner for scanning books. The glass is attached with double-stick tape and came lose on my scanner. It is not put together with common fasteners that would make it easy to take apart and repair. The glass drops down on the scanning mechanism, causing it to get stuck, in addition to dirt getting inside. Sometimes I turn the unit upside down to scan."
4,"Hardware good, software sad","I'm using this with a PowerMac G5 (and expect to also use it with a PowerBook G4). The included software works in OS 9, but not at full hardware capability as to resolution, and not at all under OS X except in Classic.A Google search turned up a ""SANE"" driver which works fine at 600 dpi and several lower dpi's as a PhotoShop plugin. (I'm scanning 11 x 17, 23.5 x 30 inch and larger plan sheets, maps, etc. There are large format plan scanners, somewhat unaccountably more expensive than large format injet plotters.)The mechanism is similar to many low end flat bed letter size scanners, with time per sheet more due to longer scanning head travel.For the price, I'd give five stars if it came with current software."
1,Wanting it to work doesn't make it so,I bought this item when I was primarily a Windows user. Large flat bed scanners were and still are out of reach for home use. As an artist it's just easier to create on a larger piece of paper than it is on a smaller one and then try to stitch the scanned photos together using Photoshop. I think I got this scanner to work once or twice but after many tries and having it sit around for many months I had to throw it out. It would have been great but into oblivion it went.
2,Mustek ScanExpress A3 USB Flatbed Scanner,I found the scanner does not scan colors vividly at all. They are always washed out and must be compensated for by dailing in darker brightness or darker contrast. Colors are considerably better from standard flatbed scanners like HP's models.
1,Mac users beware,"This is only compatible with OS 9.1, NOT OS X. Also, most of the software, like the FineReader OCR, is not compatible with Mac at all. Of course you have to buy it to find this out."
5,great bargain,Performs EXACTLY as advertised!We scan some docs as jpgs and some cad drawings - no photosCouldn't be more pleased - the next up is pushing $1000 and we don'tneed it
3,It's okay.,"Not exactly the best quality scans I've seen. In fact, I always run the scans through a filter in photoshop. No biggy. I don't regret buying it, but I'm not sure if I'd buy it again. Then again, for the price, you can't really complain."
2,boring,"too wordy. too complicated. too boring. the father , the husband is the GOD. the wife and the children are his servants. Isnt that something."
5,The best of three and all,"A marvellous sequel to ""Palace Walk"". It's a book about love, religion, despair, love, life and love once more. Moreover, the Kamal character gives signs of young Mahfouz who passed first half of his life unmarried. The best and most disturbing Mahfouz novel I've ever read."
4,Fascinating simple tracks.,"Great overall. I loved few simple tracks, especially S-Ray. You need a good stereo system to enjoy the deep vibes."
1,Not pre sharpened,"Well, it looks good and has a nice wide place to put your foot when digging. The D handle is also very nice.It will probably be ok...after my husband sharpens it. I am wondering if I ordered the non-sharpened shovel by mistake. Mostly at this writing, as you can probably tell, I am disappointed that it was not presharpened as in the description.After it is sharpened and I am in a better mood, I'll write new review!!! Why would the company send out a dull shovel in the first place?????"
1,not sharpened,"The shovel I received today is not sharpened, so I'm not happy that I will have to do it myself."
4,Transplant shovel,"Handle seemed a little flimsy, but it held up fine. The body of the shovel is heavy duty construction. Makes transplanting perrennials less of a chore."
5,Great price!,"Just the same as what I could have bought at Home Depot, Lowes, OSH, or the local Ace Hardware store, but at a far better price! Considering that I was buying a lot of locks for upgrading an old house I was flipping, every penny saved is another penny of profit! Amazon's marketplace is so fantastic in getting me the best deal, and only rarely do I stray to ebay, half.com, or others!"
4,Easy Installation,"This Bed/Bath lever is good for bed/ bathrooms. It uses a universal key ( looks like sardine can opener key). The main issue I have with this product is I ordered 4 pieces (satin nickel) and they have various finishing colours. One is satin nickel (dull finish), one is satin nickel (bright finish). The remaining 2 are uniform.Also 2 of them seemed to be stocks because there is a bit of corrosion in the mechanism. A spray of WD40 did the magic. Nonetheless, good buy."
5,Easy breezy.,The new levers were pretty easy to install. I wanted to prove I could do it without assistance and I did.
1,I get the feeling the author wrote these reviews.,"Suggestions if you want to waste your money on this book.1. Skip pages 1 -60 useless, boring, information about the author.2. Read only areas that are in bold. These are the exercises.3. Skip all the filler. It is about the author lending no interest, content, inspiration, etc. to the book.4. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. THIS APPEARS TO BE NOTHING BUT A PRODUCTION AUTHOR WHO CRANKS THESE THINGS OUT EVERY FEW MONTHS. Its as if he wrote the whole thing in a day. The exercises are just rehashed from other people's books and videos."
4,"Useful techniques, skip the babble","I've been trying the breathing techniques and yes, they lower my stress levels at work. I just wish he would have toned down some of the benefits people reported. Become able to remember when I was conceived?? Ewwww."
5,one of the top five books on breathing as of June 1998,"I consider Gay Hendricks to be one of my primary teachers concerning the breath and one of the world's foremost experts on the subject A gifted author and therapist, he has facilitated over 20,000 private breathing sessions. This book is a must for anyone interested in the importance of the breath and breathing. I have integrated many of his insights in to my OPTIMAL BREATHING work."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Filled with stories and not much substance. The author namedrops Andrew Weil's name (""Andy"") early on and pronounces, not suprisingly, that Andy thinks breathing is real important. The book is filled with lots of half-empty pages, so trees are a big loser, too. Summary: lots of fluff but not much information!"
4,VIDEO CASSETTE--Conscious Breathing,Hello: I don't know if Amazon sells the VIDEO but I have a copy of the VHS Conscious Breathing and I find it to be very helpful when stressed. It reminds me to slowdown my breathing to allow maximum belly breath. I feel much calmer and clearer after I do the lessons on the tape. You do focus breathing and learn techniques that will help you to get that oxygen thru out the body. We breathe from our chests these days instead of from deep down--STRESS! Take care now!!
5,JOE,"Great Book !!! I can hardly wait until the movie comes out, starring Nicholas Cage.... I think in this case, the movie WILL be as great as the book !!!"
4,Joe Review,"I like Larry Brown's stuff. And I know this guy - or a guy very much like him. Something sub-conscious, I guess."
4,JOE,"If you are a fan of Larry Brown, or Southern Literature in general, you will be spellbound with ""Joe"". As usual, Brown's characters are believable in their flaws. You will want to talk about this novel with someone after you read it..so recommend it to a friend and then be reinspired when you discuss the possibilities of what ""really happened"". What a terrible loss when Larry Brown died! Read anything you can get of his previous novels, especially ""Fay"" and the unfinished last novel ""Miracle of Catfish"""
1,Hmm...,"Well I personally did not enjoy this book. I thought it was fairly boring and skipped over more than a few long, overly descriptive paragraphs. I didn't like the ending, if you can even call something that open-ended an ""ending;"" I thought to myself, ""Huh? That's it?"" But I suppose it's good if you like the artsy, depressing, nothing-good-happens-to-anyone-or-anything type of book."
3,Great Southern Fiction,"""Joe"" is the first book I'd read by talented author Larry Brown and I have to say I'm glad.""Joe"" held my attention in many ways-despite being a very large book to read. The main character is not perfect, some people might call him a straight up jerk. Somehow when I kept reading about this man, and all his flaws I couldn't help but to like him. Mr. Brown made him so real, so human and so imperfect, that I felt like I could know a JOE living next door or down the street even. However in realife-very rarely do you get to see and understand a person, like the author made me understand Joe and the reasoning behind his motives.I highly recommend this book."
4,Surprised,"I found myself in Oxford Mississippi recently and on Sunday when most places are closed, I found a small bookstore open. Inside they had a local authors section. Larry Brown was among those authors. I found ""Joe"" to be as good a book as I have read in a while. Sometimes you stumble onto something good. I will surely seek out more of Mr. Browns writing."
5,patchwork monkey,"i read this book when I was in 2d grade, when my brother in 5th grade brought it home from the library. I read the patchwork monkey, and it scared the heck out of me!! and that picture of the monkey. EWWW! I was searching online for several days to figure out the name of this book. (Patchwork monkey kept sending me to crafts sites). Anyway a fantastic book, very scary. Would love to get a copy (used are a bit pricey) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE REPUBLISH AN ANNIVERSARY EDITION!"
5,"A superbly written, produced, and acted movie","The Missiles Of October is the superbly written, produced, and acted movie based on the thirteen days in October, 1962, when the world poised on the brink of an international nuclear conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union over the Russian attempt to base missiles with nuclear warheads on the island of Cuba, fifty miles of the coast of America. A brilliantly docudrama, The Missiles Of October takes the viewer behind the scenes in the Oval Office John Kennedy and his advisors struggled with the political and military decisions that they were compelled to make. This is a very highly recommended addition to any high-school or community library DVD/Video collection."
2,DVD With No Restoration,"I very much enjoyed the excellent casting and acting of The Missiles of October. However, I am insulted by the way they portrayed the Republicans. I also find it childish for Kennedy to be flipping the Republicans off in the guise of holding his cigar. This was as immature as the exiting Clinton staff trashing the White House.My low rating, however, is with the zero care in restoring this dramatization of history. Much of the lip-syncing was off and the copy was no different than my VHS. I am pretty sure they could have cleaned up the badly scanned frames that appeared about once every 1 to 5 minutes."
3,A very good made for TV/taped movie,"This goes on for some time, so you will need some patience, as it covers all 12 days (?) of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. The excellent cast goes to town as JFK, RFK, Stevenson, MacNamara, and more try to deal with Kruschchev, Cuba, and the unbearable tension of wondering if WWIII is around the corner."
4,Good Job,"This is the best Kennedy movie I have ever seen. It is, as it says, the most powerful docudrama ever made. The actors in this DVD are very believable...I saw the Missiles of October on British Television when I was in the Air Force in 1974. Why did I buy it now? After seeing Kevin Costner's watered-down version of the Cuban missile crisis story in Thirteen Days...I knew I had to have this one."
5,The creators & cast may be proud of their work on this.,"The MISSILES OF OCTOBER is docudrama at it's best. It presents this climactic moment of Cuban missiles threat (1962) to the peace of our world clearly. dramaticaly, accurately. It should be seen today by NATO. The evidence is here in this production: tyranical human persecution can be halted; without bombing and ground-force warfare. Historic proof is in The MISSILES OF OCTOBER. A peaceful, humane world is possible. To see it is to know it."
5,A classic docudrama,"Missiles of October may be one of the finest historical docudramas ever produced for television. The minimalist staging has the intimacy and dynamism of a stage play and yet still retains the scope and breadth of a motion picture.William Devane, as JFK, and a young Martin Sheen as RFK, head a cast of incredible character actors who accurately and with real depth and sincerity recreate all of the key figures in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The teleplay also offers a unique insight into the mindset of the cold war and the extent to which Kennedy - and Khruschev - went to prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control.I can't say enough good about this movie. If you have a taste for history, or simply a love of great drama, you must see it."
3,Close To The Edge,"MISSILES OF OCTOBER feels too much like a stage play but, in an odd way, that feeling adds to the suspense of the film: you feel as trapped by circumstance and distance from ground zero (so to speak) as Kennedy and Khrushchev must have.The performances here are outstanding. I could never really believe Devane in any other part after this, and it took APOCALYPSE NOW to make Sheen something other than RFK in my mind."
1,technical difficulties with the DVD,"I was looking forward to comparing this version of the Cuban Missile Crisis with that portrayed in ""Thirteen Days"". Unfortunately, the DVD, when opened, had odd filaments on the hub of the disc which couldn't be removed. My player could not read the disc (a first for this player).Amazon has a very organized way of returning defective DVDs. I hope to get it replaced."
4,A Magnificent Living History,"This 1974 TV movie is much more that simply a TV movie; it takes you inside the White House during the most dangerous time in history- when we came closest to nuclear war. Tension builds as Kennedy (William Davane) considers options, and fights internal advise which almost certainly would have led to war against the Soviet Union. Howard da Silva is wonderful as he humanizes the Russian Premier, evan as he battles long-distance with the President. Unfortunately, every time I ordered this DVD from Amazon, they failed to give me anything other than a defective product. Returns are a hassle since they fail to acknowledge receipt; and getting a check back is virtually impossible. Talking to a person is totally impossible."
3,"Great Movie, Horrible DVD","The Missiles of October is like watching a play in the sense that the sets and physical action are minimal. That means you're focused on the actors, most of whom don't disappoint. Devane basically channels Kennedy.The problem is that by being focused on the actors, it's impossible to miss the sync issues that make this DVD almost unwatchable. Voices lag mouths by a fraction of a second, which becomes really distracting when there are close-ups -- and there are plenty in this movie -- of an actor's face.According to the Internet Movie Database, The Missiles of October ""was originally shot on videotape, and first shown in this format, but when it was sold to local stations, it was transferred to film."" Perhaps that transfer has something to do with the sync problems. Whatever the reason, it's unforgivable that this problem wasn't fixed before the DVD was issued.I give the movie five stars and the DVD one."
5,Still an amazing production,"This is the original film version of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The acting is excellent and the story intense. I lived through this, and as much as I can tell this is very accurate. Although we must rely on ""insider"" points of view as to what occurred behind the closed doors of the White House."
4,reasonably good drills so far ...,"Having been frustrated by many hex shank drill bits that wobbled, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact the bits in the set I received did run reasonably ""true"", though not all were dead on. One does have to reposition a bit sometimes within the drill chuck for best alignment, but even then I have yet to see a set of hex shanks that will run perfectly true, even those sold by Dewalt and Bosch. I tested a couple of bits by drilling 1/4"" mild steel and they cut well and did not seem to show any obvious wear in the edge or the titanium coating. The package says they are assembled in the USA from parts made in China and the USA. The hex shanks are made from a mysterious nonmagnetic cast alloy, rather than steel. I have not tried drop testing the bits for fragility."
4,Mislabeled.,"The bits are advertised to range in size from 1/16"" to 3/8"". In reality, the largest bit in the set is 1/4"""
3,"A GOOD book, Not Earth shattering.","I have read two of Carlson's ""Don't sweat the small stuff"" series books. This one was better than ""Don't sweat the small stuff, Just make money"". This book has suggestions on how to relate to problems and annoyances in a family environment and is remindful of how important family should be to us. There was little I took from this book that would greatly change my life, but it was good reading and has a few good suggestions in dealing with day to day family issues."
4,Short and Sweet,"It's not rocket science - getting along with your family - but isn't it astounding how many people can't get along at home on a regular basis? Even if you're fortunate to have nearly perfect family relations, you'll find yourself in at least one situation in this little book.Carlson makes his points simply and in a straightforward manner which almost hits you in the head with: ""OF COURSE! THIS MAKES SENSE! WHY HAVEN'T I DONE THIS BEFORE? ""You'll enjoy the suggestions and practicing the ways to get along better with everyone who means anything to you in life (and even those you don't care so much about).Judge this book by its cover ~ it's filled with often overlooked words of wisdom!"
3,"Quick Read, Some Good Advice, No Revelations","You'll get more out of it if you are married and have a spouse, instead of only roommates. Gives basic advice about living with other people, repeating some of the original 'Don't Sweat The Small Stuff -- It's All Small Stuff' advice. Doesn't have much about kids. I'd consider this a decent X-mas gift for newlywed couples who haven't lived with each other that long. If you're single, don't bother and get a different 'Small Stuff' series book instead."
5,Recommended by Health News Network,"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff With Your Family has been recommended as a timely and well-written guide deserving our highest rating. We only select winning books based on sound and healthy advice. This one not only meets those criteria, it offers readers valuable information and guidance they will find both useful and easy to follow. A Health News Network ""best buy."""
4,Reality Check--What We Need to Know,I am fascinated by Maybury's ability to make history seem relevant. He is fairly persuasive in showing the error of American meddling in the Middle East. Maybury is one of the few men who has the ability to change my political views. My only complaint is that the book should be bigger. I get the feeling he is jst offering a cursory version of what he really has to say.
5,This book is GOLD in any business person's library!,"This desk reference is a wonderful tool. I thank God for the publishing of this book. I am a busy Mom/Wife/Accountant/MBA Student/Entrepreneur. This book saves me a lot of time and energy when I am doing research. I can get a quick synopsis of the topic, which makes it easy to narrow down my research efforts for more information on that particular topic. Or it helps to refresh my memory of an area of study. It reminds me of all the different essentials involved in certain consulting projects or research papers. GET THIS BOOK, THE INVESTMENT IS EXTREMELY WORTHWHILE!"
3,Still a niche to fill,"I had a comprehensive exam to cover all of my core classes as the end of my MBA, in place of a dissertation. Having sold all of my books on Amazon (oops) after finishing the individual classes, I needed something to catch me back up in all the core disciplines. Well this book didn't quit do it. It was good in the more numberless skills such as strategy, marketing and some econimics but fell way short of the mark in the more number intensive areas of statistics, finance, and accounting. When I say way short of the mark, I don't believe you could find even the subject for the latter three areas in the book. It is a decent reference and provides good information on the areas it covers but I would expect more from a 'desk reference'."
4,gaffers tape,"This tape held up well through the second half of the fishing season. I used it to tape up the vinyl bench seat cushion on my boat after it split open. I still have it on the cushion and it will probably continue to work fine, even though I plan on having a new cushion made up."
1,Not so good,"The basket does not cling to my stainless steel sink unless it is on the bottom of the sink - the magnets are not strong enough. So I use it on top of the sink next to the faucet, which is not what I wanted. Not what I expected. Magnets are NOT very strong."
4,"Good, strong magnets",I was very satisfied with this product. Magnets are strong enough to support storage of heavy items.
3,smaller then I expected,When I ordered the Extra Large I thought I was getting a fairly large basket and when it came in it was a lot smaller then I thought it would be. There was no description on dimensions so I assumed picking the extra large would work. I can't use it for what I wanted to but I am using it. Besides being small it does help me save some counter space.
3,Costume shoe,"Not a very durable shoe, but really only meant for costuming. A little challenging to walk in since they're so long, but totally cool :)"
1,Product Expired,"Nair Lasting Effects Hair Remover, Ready to Use Wax Strips, Legs/Body/Biniki Area 1 kitI am very dissapointed with this purchase because the seller sent an expired product. It does not show the expiration date but it must be expired since the wax strips are really dry and even after following the instructions and trying to separate the strips, still they are hard and dry. I had used this product in the past when it was sold at stores,(now is not sold anymore at stores here in MN) and it worked just fine but this time I believe that I lost my money."
4,"Yes, it does work","I use this product every week, and yes it does work. But, there is a trick to it. First, you pull apart the wax strips. Most of the wax will be on one side. Use only that side. Fold it in half, and rub vigorously to soften the wax. Pull apart gently. Then apply, and ""rip off"" quickly. It works. I actually use if for the face."
1,bad buy,"This was one bad buy. Didnt think it would be such a bummer. I will not buy it again. They haven't put enough wax on these strips, so it takes out some and leaves some... Lesson for me....ALWAYS READ CUSTOMER REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING. {I had skipped for this one)"
1,Lousy Product,"I felt stupid when I read the review after I had already purchased the product but I went ahead and tried it and boy... were you right! The product is ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not one piece of hair came out. Save your money and don't waste it on this product. Go for laser or the traditional shaving method.Lousy, lousy, lousy, lousyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy., who is it made for???? I guarantee the most soft skin with soft hair won't even get any hair out."
1,ZERO ! did not work,"This product did not work for me at all. No matter how long I rubbed the strips between my hands they never pulled apart sucessfully. The wax was brittle and adherred to one side only, no matter how warm it was or how slowly I pulled, even tried warming in the microwave but it never worked. What a waste of money. I give it ZERO stars."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm disappointed to say the least with this product. I was expecting a clear picture as depicted in the product image, however what I received was a large piece of photo paper with a unclear image that appears to have been stretched to fit. However, I have ordered from poster revolution before and this is the first time I am unhappy with what I received. They told me it would take 2-3 days to be processed before shipment and it was shipped quicker than promise and arrived before the expected date. Just don't bother with this particular product from them."
2,Activation by Tracfone denied!!,"I wanted a replacement for my old C139 that would no longer hold a charge even with a new battery. It would not hold a charge for more than 2 days even if turned completely off. Got a new phone from one of the many Amazon suppliers and it looked just fine. But when I called Tracfone to activate it they said I had purchased it from an unauthorized reseller who admitted to me in an private email that they bought the C139 four years ago from Walmart. So what did I do wrong? Fortunately, Amazon has returned my purchase price and I am sending the C139 back to the reseller at his expense. Where did I make my mistake? BTW the reason for replacing the old phone with the same model is that it took a long time for an old fogie like me to learn how to use the C139 and I did not want to start all over again. I am a technophobe meaning it took me many years to even get my first cellphone:-)"
5,Awesome game,"I found this sitting on my cousin's bookshelf and I traded it for a instaliing new updates. I tried playing this on his XP but the game was slow and the computer was freezing.However, I took it home and played the first three 'cities' on my Vista 32-bit and it works like a charm. The first game is identical to the original Crazy Taxi, which I own, with some upgrades so at least there was some familiarity.There are 3 different cities and new sets of drivers. There are multiple passengers to drive with, which was a something that was missing entirely from CT1. I think it is in CT2, but I haven't tried that one yet.The music is very much the same. I think I heard two new songs but I wasn't paying too much attention. I'd give it an A."
2,Fun but doesn't work well on XP,The game looks like it will be fun if I can ever get the white blotches off the screen. I've downloaded patches and tried differant settings none of which has helped yet..
1,"""DOESN'T WORK""","Bought this program for my grandson for Christmas. After installation, it freezes up. My daughter went to manufacturer, they admitted this is a common problem. Was instructed to down-load an old driver. The instructions were complicated and couldn't do as instructed. It appears they have a bug in their program, and haven't fixed it. When ""Crazy Taxi 3"" was installed, it acknowledged program has been installed correctly, but screen then freezes upon opening. The computer is a Windows XP with plenty of memory. My grandson has Cerebral Palsy and although physicallydisabled, he uses the computer for his education and entertainment.Sincerely, Marty Errick"
1,Not current enough to compete.,"One word. Outdated. There are many, many combat flight sims out there that simply blow this out of the water."
3,ok,Bittersweet is the story of Teddy who goes to Ireland to do a story of the very popular author Joachim West who's been out of the public eye for awhile. People end up thinking they are husband and wife because Teddy has to stay at his house and he don't want to ruin her image. The two end up falling for each other fast. Pretty good.
5,A Sweet & Lovely Book...,"As a huge fan of Janice Sims, I can honestly say there is nothing's bitter about this book. She is not your typical author that writes about the same thing over & over again. I have always admired the way Ms. Sims places black characters in exotic, far away locations and give us the readers, something different to read. You can tell by reading any one of her many books, that Ms. Sims is always thinking of ways to be creative and inspiring. Beautiful work Ms. Sims..."
3,aminos,"I have been trying this new product for about 3 weeks now and I think that it does the job. The only think I dont like is that it does not tell you if you are suppose to take the servings before or after workout, so I decided to take 3 before and 3 after along with another supplements. We'll see the results after I finished the product."
3,"12"" cable, sometimes too short even for microATX","This cable, when laid flat, measures 12 inches from the backplate to the tip of the header pin connector.With a microATX motherboard in my microATX case, it just barely didn't reach the furthest PCI slot at the bottom of the case. By juggling PCI cards, I was able to use a closer PCI slot.With one hard drive in the top drive bay, this cable would have just reached the furthest slot, with the cable stretched in a straight line. However, two of the three disk drives intruded on the shortest possible cable path.Take a minute to measure the length of cable you'll need in your case, by using another ribbon cable to simulate your actual cable run, before you buy this.Otherwise, the cable appears to be of reasonable quality and works as intended."
2,Too Short,"I couldn't get it to fit on my motherboard using one the free slots. In order to use it, I would've had to taken out one of the PCI-X cards, which is not really an option."
3,Not Catchy Enough,"Twice,I have began this book,found it quite interesting,put it aside and forgotten all about it.I think this shows that it isn't what you call a page turner."
5,One side stopped heating after 6 months,"I was extremely happy with this straightener until I noticed that it wasn't working as well as it normally does. One side of the iron no longer heats up. Becasue this happened 5 months after I purchased the iron, I could no longer return it via Amazon. However, I contacted Reminton's warranty department and they graciously sent out a new unit. Now this is a company that backs up their products. Highly recommended."
5,Tames frizzies all day long even in the wet sponge that is Florida,"I just bought this iron last week and it is absolutely amazing. I have mostly straight hair but it tends to get VERY frizzy especially in the summertime in Florida where I live. It is comparable to a CHI with how straight and shiny my hair will stay for days! However, unlike the CHI this flat iron just glides over your hair. It has never once snagged a hair out and my hair actually looks healthier! The auto shut-off is very convenient as well because I tend to forget about turning things off so this is a safety feature that I can really appreciate AND it has a 4 year warranty! Highly recommended!"
2,not for me,"I tried this straightener and I found with my first use that it is not for me. First off the control panel is right where you hold it, so I kept turning it off every time I lifted it up to straighten a piece of hair. So I'd turn it back on again, go to straighten another piece and off it went again. Once I made myself conscious of this and held it without pressing the buttons, I found that the plates were so slippery that it flew through my hair. I'm guessing it is better for thinner, finer hair, not thick hair like I have and that is why it is so slippery. If your hair is damaged, it won't stay on it for long, so I guess that is why it was made for damaged hair."
1,Wish it would get a little hotter,After using this product for over a month I defintely would not recommend it. I thought the plates would create less damage but it caused more damage to my hair than my previous flat iron. Maybe if you only use cheap flat irons this would be a good product and cause less but my Solia Flat Iron never caused the amount of damage this does in a month's worth of use. My recommendation is if you value your hair to stay clear of this and invest in a good flat iron.
1,Quit working after only a month,"I bought this flat iron a few weeks ago, and it has already quit working. It will turn on and heat up, and then shut off. I plan to return it to the store that I bought it from and purchase a different brand."
5,AMAZING!!!,I'm transitioning from relaxed to natural at the moment and I bought flat iron because my other one wasnt cutting it. So just recently used it for the first time yesterday and my hair has never been so straight besides going to the hair salon!! Now I've been telling everyone about this.
3,It's okay.,"I don't know why, but it turns off after only a few seconds now. At first, it was great but now it turns itself off after it heats up."
4,Good Hair Straightener,"I am overall very satisfied with purchasing this hair straightener. I have thick wavy hair that I often get colored. I have used many straighteners over the years. I have even paid $500 to have it chemically straightened but that was years ago.At first I wasn't sure I would like this straightener because the Teflon Fiber Plates were strange to me. It felt weird.But now that I have been using this straightener for several months I am used to them and I do believe they protect from damaging my hair.I wouldn't say this has helped cut down on the time it takes me to straighten my hair just because my hair wants to be wavy and is so thick. However, it straightens nicely and seems to make my hair a little more shiny.Cons- I have to say the buttons are placed in a bad spot. I am constantly touching them when using it. Also the digital display seems to be acting up a little. We'll see how long it will last!"
4,Great,Great for straightening hair. Perfect size for short or long hair. I think it's great for everyday use. Recommend this if you are looking for a good hair straightener.
4,"Lightweight, heats up fast","I didn't think I would like this iron as much as I do. After my first use I wasn't impressed and wondered if this was a keeper. Then the second time I used it I realized how nicely it slides over my hair shaft and how lightweight it is. I use my straightening iron on occasion to curl my hair (see you tube for curling with a straightening iron) and this does an absolutely fabulous job. I've used it two days in a row to do this, and my hair looked really good and it was so easy to do since this is lightweight. I love the digital display (most straighteners have this). My only complaint is the lock, it's absolutely awful. I've had other Remington straighteners with this same lock, and to be honest, I wouldn't pay $$ for straightener without a good lock. If they could improve this one thing, this would be a top recommendation by me,"
3,Nice for the $ but don't expect miracles,"This is the 3rd or 4th straightening iron I've reviewed on Amazon. I like the price of this one, for sure! However, I think it might be worth it to pay $20-30 more and get a slightly better iron. Here are the pros/cons:ProsHeats very quickly and beeps when it's readyHas high settings for people with thick or difficult to straighten hairTeflon fiber plates are very easy on your hair and won't snag itFairly long cordPrice is rightConsTakes several run-throughs to get hair as straight as some irons that only take once or twiceNo lock on the iron to keep it clamped shut (to be fair, only 1 iron that I've tried has this, but I love it)Heat setting might be too high for anyone with thin or fine hairThough there are more pros than cons, the con of taking several run-throughs is enough to make me go back to my slightly more expensive stand-by."
5,cool,i love these bad boys. i have natural thick curly hair and this flat iron works like magic u should buy it. i have no complaints at all.
4,works well. good price.,"I bought this bc my sister has a similar one that she got from Target that works amazingly well. This one works well too, but it seems to not get as hot (and therefore not get hair as straight) as other similarly priced flat irons. On the other hand, it works so much better than the $10 one I had before! The Teflon plates definitely seem to keep my hair safer from damage than other flat irons."
1,hair straightener,"I bought this item 6 months ago, have used it just 7 times and it does not work now. It's not getting hot. Want it to be fixed or replaced."
5,"Straightens hair, read this regarding temperature buttons","We have two hair straighteners, one with wider plates and this one. Both work well.This one is smaller and lighter, which makes it easier to use. For that reason, it has become the favorite. We didn't recognize the weight of the other one until we got this one.Other reviewers have mentioned that the temperature buttons are too easy to push mistakenly while in use. There is in fact a temperature lock feature, just hold down the minus button and the temperature is locked in. Problem solved!"
2,Its not too good,This flatiron is quite disappointing i was trying to get rid of frizz. The hightest heat setting did not get hot enough to straighten my hair.
2,Could be better,"This product heats up quickly, but the temperature buttons are set up to when you are styling your hair-you hit the buttons. (Causing the temperature to change-or shutoff) It's not comfortable due to the button placement. I needed a straightener and will settle for this one. But, will not recommend it for others."
3,Not worth it.,"I bought this hair straightener because My vidal sasooon was too small and pulled my hair out. So I bought this one hoping it wouldn't damage my hair that much because it had the teflon fibers and what not. But when I used this my hair got straight but got all frizzy and dull too,and I have medium hair thickness. It wasn't worth the money."
3,The age old debate,"This product returns to the age old debate: healthy hair vs killer style. This product is better for your hair. The fabric is much softer on your hair than metal plates, and I could tell a difference in the shine/softness of my hair.However, for me the fabric created it's own problem. Friz. Every time I'd release the pates it looked, well, like I had ran fabric over my hair. Also, although the straightener gets nice and hot, it had problems with my thick and wavy hair.Overall the product is not bad per se. It just depends where your priorities are when looking for a styling product."
4,Great straightener,"I wavered back and forth as to which straightener to buy. I have very thick, coarse, colored hair and have had a hard time in the past finding a straightener that 1) did the job, and 2)didn't make my hair look dried out. This one did the trick. I definitely like it. The only problem I have is that the placement of the on/off and temperature control buttons are right where I hold it and sometimes I am switching it up or down or off when using it."
5,Awesome!,I love this product. It keeps my medium length hair straight for up to three days and is quick and easy to use. I bought one for myself and one for my daughter. She loves hers as much as I love mine. She has very long thick curly hair and it straightens it easily!! This is definitely an A+ flat iron. One drawback: The on/off/temp buttons are somewhat easily altered (albeit accidentally) due to their positioning. (You can lock the temp/on off button by holding down the '-' button for a few seconds)I certainly recommend this product.
3,Good For Occasional Use,"If, like me, you're not a die-hard hair flattener and only do it for certain occasions or funsies, then this is a great little product for the price. It heats up quickly and turns my hair lovely and sleek and smooth, although since I have VERY thick, long, wavy hair, I do have to do it in very small segments so it works.On the other hand, if you are looking for something you're going to use once a week or more, this might wear out its welcome fast. The placement of the very sensitive buttons on the handle means you're constantly accidentally hitting them with your fingers while you're trying to get a secure grip on it as you use it, and as a result, it's extremely awkward and frustrating to use. For casual, once-in-a-while usage, this is probably a good choice, but if you want something more comfortable to use more often, and for long periods of time, consider another product."
5,less damage,"This really does seem to be better for hair. the teflon fabric on the plates provide a softer surface for hair to slide through, and it just makes sense that not cruching strands of hair between two bare metal plates is better for your hair. That said, I do wish that it had a larger flattening surface."
3,"Not quite a ""real"" straightener","It does heat up quickly enough. However, the two sections don't quite meet so I had to press them together the whole time that I was working with my hair. I have really thick hair so I was pretty surprised by this. It did an okay job but I've used better and my hair wasn't as straight as it could have been."
4,Worked well enough for me,"This unit was easy to use and did what was advertised: straightened my hair. I liked that it had a fast heat up time and the digital temp gauge was a welcome change to the turn dial of my old straightener. Turn dials can be moved more easily when styling so the digital gauge with buttons worked out better for me. The cord swivel made it easy to use without the cord getting in the way. All in all, I would use this again to straighten my hair. It was lightweight enough to use without getting yoru arm tired halfway through. I would recommend using small sections of hair or you will have to go over the same spots again and again (leading to damage)."
5,hair straightener,it's a fine line- style and damage hair or have unruly healthy hair. I have a tendency use a straightener more often than I should. I don't know if this is 'therapy' for your hair but I do feel that it is 'damage control' for my hair. I takes a bit to get used to the feel of you hair sliding through the Teflon plates but after that it's a breeze. I still have the same complaint about the buttons being poorly placed. Most Remington straighteners have that problem. As you are using the iron it's difficult not end up with your fingers changing the temperature. You have to hold it further up and try not to burn your fingers.
3,GETS REALLY HOT!,I know a flatiron is supposed to get hot but this gets so hot that it burned my hair. So maybe it wasn't all the fault of the flatiron and that's why I have a regular beauty shop appointment but still...I would recommend this for the person that really knows how to operate one and not burn your hair. Thinking about donating this to the local beauty college or maybe one of the students.
4,"Fast heat, definite buy.","I like the high temp of this iron. It does a great job, my only complaint is that the buttons to turn it on/off, and to change the temp are right where I put my hands to hold the iron closed. It's minor, and I would still buy it, because it seems like every flat iron or curling iron put their on/off buttons in the same place."
4,Great flat iron :),I am only giving 4 stars because somehow I can't lock this product into desired temperature. it always locks up to 430 degrees and that is way too much for my hair. but otherwise it makes my hair sleek and soft and straight :) for days to come :)
2,Too much time,"I just don't like this straightener, I can believe I made so much research and for nothing. First of all it takes too long to straightened my hair and my hair is only wavy not curly. Before it would take me about 10 minutes, now it's taking me 20-25. I have to pass the straihtener through each hair portion more than 3 times in order to get it straight enough. The plates do not get hot enough and the control buttons are badly misplaced, I'm always pressing them by accident."
1,Think before you buy,"I purchased this product from Amazon and I am very disaapointed with this product.Withing three days,its display light gone and while using this product,it heat up a lot,due to too much heat on handle its very diffcult to hold"
4,Does What is Supposed To,"This does not come with a cord for plugging into the wall. It is assumed that you are using this with a desktop and will use that cord. The light in my laptop went out and the table where I use it is small so I didn't want a big monitor. This one does the job. It connects to the laptop with a VGA connector and can also connect to the speaker outlet of the laptop. It originally came out in 2000 so it is old but works fine with my laptop bought in 2006. The screen is smaller than a 15.4"" laptop so I have to scroll to see everything. A new 17"" flat panel isn't much more than this one was but I didn't need it so I got this. The display goes off when it has no signal or your computer is hibernating to save energy. It comes back on automatically when the computer starts again."
2,Unfortunately Useless,"As anyone who makes a living designing books can tell you, most books are not $200 art books. But that's what Derek Birdsall seems to concentrate on in his ""Notes on Book Design."" Really, it's a no-brainer to make the art as large as possible and have the specs in a sans serif font. I don't need endless examples showing me exactly that. I'd like to see what Birdsall does with 30,000 words that the publisher insists page out to 272 pages in a 6 x 9 size, but ""not look too horsey or airy."" I bet he'd quit.Addditionally, his choice of a typewriter font for the text make the book useless to the reader. Birdsall insists his publisher could not choose a better font--I doubt that. I got one for ya, Birdsall--Garamond. You should try it some time!Ultimately, the tome serves neither the page designs shown as illustrations (too small in most cases) nor the reader. Perhaps a design student may get something out of this, but there must be better books out there on the same subject."
2,The work in here is really dated,"I bought this book purely based on its cover and subject but the content inside, while thorough in its text, is lacking in examples of work that is current. The work profiled here is actually rather dated and not inspiring at all."
4,Decent films,Not bad. Great acting and the action sequences were well done. Often compared to the Toshiro Mifune trilogy of the same name. Both versions are worth checking out.
2,MOS - You're becoming complacent,"Very disappointing from MOS - we've known them to be frontrunners in bringing us the sounds we want to hear (and in the past might not have heard much of) Now it's ordinary and nothing new. The oldies CD bears even more witness to this fact. Look elswhere to spend your money. C'mon MOS you and we know you can do better!!Post Note: After reading Adam Smith's review below, I think he must work for the MOS marketing dept or a related association."
3,Dandelion root tincture,I'm sorry to say I could not use this tincture. It looked and tasted awful!. It also had a terrible odor.
5,comes as advertised,"This comes in a plastic envelope -- obviously gag jewelry ... costume jewelry -- but that's what I ordered.It arrived as advertised and the seller did a a great job ensuring customer satisfaction. Kudos all around.As you may imagine, it's nothing special and feels cheap, but as costume jewelry, it does the job."
4,Funny game,"I got this for my 6-yr old son. It arrived on time and in excellent condition. He loved it from minute one! I heard him laugh many time the first day. So much so that I later joined in, and funny it was.There are a lot of challenging games, funny gameplay in general, and clear graphics. A bit difficult for a 6-yr old in some of the stages, but still easy to watch and follow, and he/she wont get bored at all. In general, with a little patience, most of the stages can be played by a 6 yo child."
4,The other reviews cover it well.,"Vendor delivery is excellent. I would buy again.The missing star is based on game play, not vendor performance.The lengthy, informed reviews by experienced gamers are excellent and I concur.One positive for parents:Do you find that your son says ""I'll be right there,"" but never arrives?Do you find that your son says, ""Aw Dad, I'm in the middle of a level. I can't stop!""This game might not hold your son's interest for long, but time-to-trash-can-on-street will be less."
4,Awesome!,I have received the product and everything was just as specified. works great! THANK YOU!! I have been searching everywhere literally for this game.
2,Stupid,"Maybe fun with Natal, but stupid with a controller pad. Lame story mode with too much time spent waiting and loading."
1,Cr@#,It came and didn't work. We had the game buffed at the local video game store still didn't work.Should of sent it back but to late now.
5,good game for the 360,"i'm not into a ton of fighting/war/""hard for me"" games lol. And thats one reason I dont find a lot of games for the 360 that I want. But I love this game, it's a ton of fun!"
1,Real piece of garbage!!!!!!!!!!,"What a piece of garbage. I have a ZUNE 80gb and it does NOT fit.I think this MIGHT fit some older units but it clearly does not fit any current ones.Get out your dremmel kit and start cutting new slots. With some new slots and more padding it may yet work, but like I said... what a piece of garbage."
1,Outdated Device,"This product did not fit my 120GB or 80GB Zune. I spoke with BELKIN customer service directly and was informed that this product has been discontinued and in fact was designed to fit ""1rst Generation"" Zunes. So in less you have one of the very original produced Zunes. DON'T BUY IT!!!"
4,"Good product, but discontinued.","This product, and the companion one developed for iPods, are great ideas that can help you survive a long period without AC power. Unfortunately, this product was developed before the Zune 80 came out, and does not fit that model. And Belkin has apparently decided to discontinue the product for the Zune. You won't find it on their website, and I got this response from their customer service.""Thank you for contacting Belkin Technical Support.Unfortunately, the Tunepower for Zune part # F8M027 has been discontinued and a tray was never created for the new 80GB model.

5,The Agent and His Beauty!,"I have read all of Crystal's books but this one seems to be her best. I enjoyed this book because it had intimacy, danger and humor. I found as this story began it immediately took life right into the plot, not wasting any time for the reader. Clint and Madison's attraction is real, very intimate and they are quite humorous together. Even in the midst of danger they still find ways to give each other ""kisses""! I admire the creativeness the author has done with this story about the agent, the drug lord and the house sitter. This is an easy one day read that you will enjoy. Congratulations to my homegirl for this one was GREAT!"
5,Great Book!!,"This was my first by Wilson-Harris. I really enjoyed the book, it has a lot to offer a reader: mystery, lies, secrets, love, misunderstandings, and forgiveness. I loved it!"
2,MASQUERADE INDEED:,"REALLY BAD! I HAVE READ 2 OTHER OF THIS AUTHORS NOVELS CHERISH AND THE ART OF LOVING WHICH WERE RATHER GOOD. HOWEVER, THIS ONE COMES UP SHORT . I FOUND IT ON THE UNREALISTIC SIDE."
5,Excellent....,"Excellent performance and recording. A must-have for Bill Evans fans. Words, words, words, words - I need twenty of them."
5,Color,"I wanted to respond to the other review. If you choose to purchase window coverings from this set instead of making them or getting them elsewhere, please know that the curtains are a darker stripe (not the tan plaid). But they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker, the border on the wall hangings and quilt, the trim on the hamper, etc. It is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern."
3,it works,"It works as it should, only problem is the fine dirt and dust I pick up it reduces vacuum power quickly. I've got to constantly pull the filter and clean it. But it's still better than the cheap paper filters."
4,An Excellent Publication,"This is an excellent book - containing company name, address, contact numbers, website address, names of top company executives, arranged state wise and updated every 6 months. Solid 589 pages of stuff. A great marketing tool. Those aiming to search for an IT job in a particular geographical location would find this a great help to target the available companies in their chosen area.If a CD accompanies the book with all the entries, even if the price is suitably changed, it would be more helpful.All in all good value for your dollars."
2,"Could not get to fly in light wind, finicky in moderate wind","Although the kite is cute as heck, we found it impossible to fly in light wind, and it required a very determined adult to keep it in the air in moderate wind. The tail is too heavy for light and moderate wind, and adds only minimal stability. Of 3 new kites we used over the course of a long weekend, this one was the hardest to get and keep aloft. Not recommended."
1,Does not work,Could not get this kits to fly even in high wind. After two attempts this kite found itself in the trash.
5,"So strong, so strong","I bought this on March 25, 1997 the day it came out, I've had it in my Walkman ever since. No other tape has made it past the lid.Stupendous."
3,"This has flaws, yet with a gem or two or three...","The other reviewers here who gave this CD three stars have valid points, and I suggest reading them before buying this. The vocals are a bit low-volume, the songs in general are a bit melancholy, and the styles kinda melting pot. Yet Ms. Krauss does have a voice of distinction and her bandmates are skilled musicians (not so much vocally, for my taste.) I haven't owned many Krauss recordings, so I can't say this is better or worse than her other releases. If you like bluegrass/contemporary country sounds, and find this at a bargain price, pick it up."
5,Alison Krauss. PS to previous review,"PS: to my Review of Alison Krauss & Union Station's So Long So Wrong Album. It is a 5 Star for me. I now have 150 Albums in my Amazon MP3 Cloud. Collected over several years. Also it is a good way to downlpad to;my other phones and to my Kids & GrandKids. My phones are my source of music in my life. I have a Motorola Droid BIONIC, a Motorola Tazr MAXX and 2 HTC Droid REZUOND ( Dr Dre) Phones. W. Neal Gray"
3,Just Doesn't Fit,"This one doesn't get played often although, it was an award winner back in the day. It just doesn't have that same feel as the older albums. And not the same feel as the newer pop-grass stuff. Maybe a bit too heavy on the sad songs. Not my favorite but I wouldn't be without it either."
5,"So Long, So Wrong",Absolutely fantastic CD. Her delivery of a song and her wide range of vocals are just about impossible to beat. She is incredible and sings like an angel.
5,Union Station can do no wrong!,"This beautiful album shows once again why people who say that they hate country (that top 40 stuff), love bluegrass. Incredible musicianship, fine material, and soul. Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks should be doing Alison Krauss's laundry!"
3,What exactly was I expecting?,"Firstly, I need to say that Im new to bluegrass and its not something we are exposed to in Ireland very often (although it originates from our music). I listened to Bill Monroe a bit and learned to understand the importance of the three-fingered technique in banjo playing.Although Alison has an amazing voice, I felt some of the songs she performed sounded more like folk to me. The faster stuff seemed to be more core. I bought it as a good example of modern Bluegrass music but I think the styles on there were a lot broader than that."
4,Beautiful,I first heard Allison Krauss last year. I have been a fan ever since. This CD is wonderful and presents Blue Grass Music in very special way. Anyone who appreciates good music will enjoy this collection of songs.
3,Unnecessarily Short,"Frank Damazio is no stranger to long-windedness. I have another book of his called The Making of A Leader, which is almost the exact opposite of this in terms of 1) scope, 2) depth, and 3) scriptural support.This book comes across as more opinion than as experience. I didn't get much out of this book, and I've read plenty on the subject of both Prophecy in Biblical Times and Prophecy in Contemporary Times.This book was an early work of his, but I wish he'd come out with a second edition that's more expanded and in-depth, even if he stays light on theology."
4,new ink for printer,and you dont even have to leave the housethats helpful rightbetter than fighting lines at your local office supply shoppe
1,ink did not work,the delivery was prompt but after about 20 pages the ink did not work and i am going to try and return for working product
1,Cartridge failed after 6 weeks,Cartridge failed after 6 weeks and I don't print that much. Return expired after 30 days. I am trying to get an exchange.
1,cartridge didn't work,The tri color ink cartridge I purchased was defective. It didn't work in my printer. I purchased another at the store same brand & same # HP95 & it did work.
4,HP 95 Tri-color Ink refills,"Delivery was prompt. After installing the cartridge I proceeded to print out a full color promotional poster. The first print out was faded and the colors were off. This is a poster I had printed out with original HP cartridges. It took a little tweaking but, after increasing the color saturation and some color calibration; the results were very good. I would have to say that the color vibrancy is not quite up to the original cartridges but after making adjustments the final printout was very close and for the cost savings well worth it! The cartridges are an excellent value for the money and I will continue to purchase them."
4,Accurate colors,"This cartridge fits well and does what it should. I wish it didn't run out so fast though, it's really a money-sink, and I'm not even a heavy printer. Ah well, it's what works, so I'd still recommend it!"
3,Cheap? Yes... But how many prints will it allow? Remains to be seen...,"The ink cartridge expired in July 2008 (HP calls it ""warranty date""), and I purchased it in December 2008!!! How long will it last? It may cost me more money per print if this ink fails or dries out in couple months. More than that, the box indicates that this unit belongs to multi-pack, hence is not for individual sale. The envelope form recycling was not included, so I had to order it from HP separately (maybe the envelope was in the adjasent unit in multipack? who knows...). Hope this info will help you to make an informed decision about buying this item!"
1,Size,I wonder why you never give the size of the product you are selling. I need to know the length and the width.
2,Sloppy publishing,"What a shame that spell-check can't distinguish among a and an, their and there, misplaced commas, and then and than. I found 47 such errors in this book, and find it apalling that a name publisher never had it actually ""read"" before printing. Shame on them. And the title? Bears no resemblance to the subject matter or treatment. White writes very well, when his ideas make it past a rudimentary grammar check. But the book seems to be a loose collection of magazine articles, with little overriding messages. Sure, we know science has rivalries, and that scientists can be prima donnas. Anything else new here? Not much. I'd pass on this one."
4,It met the need..,The spat was a great hit at my school's costume party...good accessory for the price. You have to be careful not to get it dirty it is kind of hard to clean.
1,Where's The Rest of It,"I was very disappointed in this book. Only 24 stadiums are reviewed with very little insight or background on what makes each ballpark special. The best pictures (and there are only a few that qualify)are split across two pages. Classic ballparks such as Crosley Field are ignored yet Miller Field in Milwaukee which isn't even finished is presented. While this is my first purchase on the subject of baseball parks, I certainly hope there are better choices out there."
5,Outstanding,"I've a soft spot for banjo pickers, and Marvin Gaster is certainly one of the best I've heard.The CD brochure explains, he's the last in a long line of Lee County, North Carolina ""two-finger banjo pickers."" The great grandson of a famous fiddler, Gaster was raised by his great aunt and uncle in a tobacco farmer's house.I haven't any use for tobacco, except that the heritage and house gave us this great musician.With 24 fantastic cuts, this CD has given me hours of listening pleasure, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. It's good old fashioned bluegrass fun."
3,Good price but Not as New as Advertised,"It was cheap and came quickly, which was really helpful. However, it was disappointing that it said it was ""Like New"", but there are a lot of markings and even a doodle once you get to chapter 5, and some even before that, which can be really distracting, and I cannot erase them since they are in pen."
1,What a disappointment,"Reading the ad at amazon looking at the track listing, I hardly could await the arrival of the cd to listen to it. But what a disappointment. Not only the songs seem not to be under the participation of the original artists, but also between 2 min 30 secs and short above 5 min, most of them under 4 min. That's not my idea of a remix album. ""Less is more very often"" is a saying in Germany. This goes for this cd at any rate.The remixes aren't very good to boot.Sorry."
1,Don't waste your money,I completely agree with the other reviewers! Not remixes of the original tracks but pathetic budget-synth performances.
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST.,I LOVE THE 80'S MUSIC A LOT. BUT WHEN I GOT THIS CD I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED. NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS AND THE SONGS ARE TOO SHORT.
1,Yet another crappy public domain release. Please do not support!,"""The Lucy Show"" is being officially released by CBS/Paramount. Please do not support this illegal release with inferior quality. I'm sure the music alone is not in the public domain. How do they get away with this?"
5,Great for anybody living anywhere in the world!,"my husband is in the military and we are stationed in europe. it didn't help that we had our son during the holidays and we were leaving for europe in the new year. i was looking for a digital frame that i could upload photos of the first grandchild for both our parents and the great grandparents. i think this product is amazing once you get past the ""frustrated"" parts. if you had a problem you can certainly get great customer service or their hotline for help. it's pretty simple in my opinion and a great gift for friends or family that you don't get to see very often."
1,Worst Customer Service for high price,"I would not recommend Ceiva to anyone. We purchased 5 Ceiva's for our close family. The idea is fine, but when you have to navigate the web site or deal with Customer Service, this product is the worst. I have spent over 10 hours trying to get my mother hooked up to Ceiva's web site with the right account information, that Ceiva refuses to fix. Don't get this product unless you want to be totally frustrated for a huge fee of $230."
1,Ceiva what a joke!,"I gave it one star because -10 wasn't an option. So I was all excited to get this for my non computer savvy family for Christmas. I ordered it two weeks before the holidays. I was told if I paid the overnight shipping I would get it next day. I ended up giving them a picture as a gift, even though I was told I would get it, nothing came. It is now January and I'm being told it is backordered and they have no idea when it is coming. Besides customer service being rude and out right mean. I called for hours without getting through as well as being on hold for half an hour. I want my money back! Shame on you Ceiva. BUYER BEWARE! DON'T BUY A CEIVA!"
3,It would be great without the MSG...,"I checked this out from the library after reading the great reviews. It gives some very helpful advice with a list of must have spices, herbs, and a list of the different soup mixes with an explanation of what each can be used for. There's also a section on recipes for dry rubs and seasoning mixes which was great.I made the meatloaf last night with the beef onion soup mix and used cornbread stuffing in place of plain breadcrumbs and spread the ketchup on top. It tasted so good! Then I realized that I wasn't feeling like myself which usually happens after I have something with BHT or MSG (monosodium glutamate). All the Lipton soup mixes contain MSG. I was so disappointed. Unless I can find another brand of soup mix without MSG this book won't do me much good. :("
2,didn't like,"Don't know why this had so many good reviews. I didn't like it at all, found maybe one thing in it I'd make."
5,One of the best ever!,"I'm a cookbook junkie, endless perusing the latest editions and the old standards (and not-so-standards) for new and exciting meals. A normal cookbook purchase will usually net 3 or 4 suitable recipes for my family's tastes. The Soup Mix Gourmet has proven a bonanza! I've marked over 40 recipes that sound terrific for our needs, and all five that I have made so far were total winners. I'll be looking for more works by this author; she really has the ""magic touch"" in the kitchen! I work in a brick-and-mortar bookstore, and have recommended this book to over two dozen folks in the last couple of weeks. All of them have expressed great pleasure (one even sent me a couple of boxes of dry soup mix with a thank-you note).This book is beautifully done. Buy it today!"
3,why?,"why is it... pink? they want more words because they're drones, but really that's it - it's pink, and I want to know why."
1,Disappointed.,"First, I love Gilmore Girls--even now, it's my favorite series on TV. That said, this DVD set was a huge disappointment. I won't say much about the storyline, aside from the fact that this season is very different from the others. I, personally, don't like the change, but some might. And in any case, it's GG, and even the worst episodes own my soul.That said, the poor quality of the DVD set was a shock. The lack of English subtitles is insulting (do they no longer care about people with hearing problems?). Given that this set was priced the same as other sets, the absence of special features was just cheap.I (reluctantly) bought this set as a gift, but I'd never buy one for myself."
2,Meh...,"I can't possibly imagine how a real fan of this show could not loathe this show by the sixth season. God, it went to hell in a hand basket. Just awful. Did anyone actually like Logan? Anyone?!"
4,Drama and Distractions - yet still the Gilmore way,"Compared to previous seasons of Gilmore Girls, there were too many distractions from each plot. The characters tended to meet new people and new challenges too often, and didn't get enough time to solve the existing ones. April and the rift between Rory and Logan at Thanksgiving are just two of many dramatic events happening in the sixth season that took away the attention from the romantic plots and the relationship between Lorelai and Rory. Even thought this wasn't the best season, it isn't the worst, and any Gilmore fan needs this season."
4,"The season itself is recommended, DVD presentation of it disappoints","I was finally able to watch the latest complete season of my favorite TV show of all time. Unfortunately, I found that this DVD installment lacked subtitles and the usual booklet of all the interesting pop culture references. The only special feature on it was a CW trailer... which was a bit lame since most fans would have already been informed that the show was changing networks. (Hence, I only gave 4 out of 5 starts instead of the 5 that I would give to the other seasons' DVD sets.)However, the familiar characters did not disappoint in delivering their individual trademark humor mixed into the storyline. It was refreshing/relieving to see mother and daughter reunited and be able to exchange their daily banter again... I can only hope that the new writers on CW will maintain the integrity of the witty dialogue that seemed so effortless when Dan Palladino and Amy Sherman-Palladino wrote for GG."
1,NO English Subtitles! What were they thinking!!!,"The ONLY reason I buy the GG DVDs (and I've bought every season so far) is to read the subtitles and enjoy the writing.What possessed them to exclude the English subtitles in this season? How much extra work could that have been?I will carefully review the specifications for the Season 7 DVDs before automatically buying it the day it is released.This time: no subtitles, no purchase."
2,"Great season, horrible dvd set!!!","Don't get me wrong ... I love ""Gilmore Girls"", and the sixth season is just as good as all the others ... BUT ... the dvd set sucks.Other than a short trailer for the new season there are special features ... ABSOLUTELY NONE!!!This is such a step-back to old times that I could not even believe it at first. I mean ... all shows offer some bonus materials these days, be it featurettes, music videos, photo galleries, interviews, commentaries, or whatever else!!I just think that is absolutely inacceptable to release a dvd set of such a popular tv show with no bonus materials whatsoever.That's why I give this box only 2 stars, and I am sure I'm not the only one who's very disappointed about this lack of special features."
2,Gilmore Girls fans beware!,"this season gets WAY too soap opera for my family's taste, but maybe thats just us. I just wish they had kept it simpler like it was in the beginning."
3,Disappointing DVD set,"You can find out all about the Gilmore Girls in any of these reviews. The DVD has the show just as it was on tv. Literally.I watch the Gilmore Girls regularly. The reason I get the DVD is for the extras, which this season is TOTALLY lacking. Not even one deleted scene.If you're looking for DVD extras, don't buy this season!"
5,I am faithful til the end.,"Ok, for those of you who think that the 6th season was bad then how can you call yourself true Gilmore Fans? There's going to be drama in any television show. We couldn't just sit and watch Rory and Lorelai together all the time. They've got to grow up and have their own lives at some point. I absolutely loved this season, if you were a 21 year old going to college and living on your own, you'd live right along side them because life is that dramatic. Just because the writer's do something different, doesn't mean it's a bad thing. This season was about love, plain and simple and the season to come will see how much Rory and Logan mean to eachother now that they're really apart."
3,Sucky Season Six,"I've watched since day one and had loved every episode.....until season six. Oh my gawd, it was bad. I thought the issues between Luke, Loralei & ""the new daughter"" was so badly handled. Jeeze!!! The issues between Loralei & Rory took forever. The band fighting on stage when they knew a record guy was in the audience, come-on, really!?! Loralei running to Chris in the last moments of the last episode? NO WAY!!So basically, I ended up ebaying off my first 5 seasons I had purchased and won't be buying this one. Though I must say, I will continue to watch till the end to see how it wraps up.Nothing lasts forever I guess, including a great TV show......whatever, onto my new favorite show on TV, ""HOUSE"" starring Huge Laurie....Tuesday nights on the Fox network eh! Enjoy :-)"
4,love it,i love this season so much. seeing jess again is so great. they need to make more parts for him. he looks even good on his new show on 10. this is a must get season.
4,It keeps getting better and better by the season,I'm a big fan of Gilmore Girls and I only have one negativ thing to say about season 6. They took away the english subtitles :( I'm from Sweden and my native language is swedish so I really need the english subtitles to get every little bit of the conversations as they sometimes can get pronounced a little fast. All the previous seasons had english subtitles.About the stories in season 6: They truly rock! Rory is really growing up and the romance between Luke and Lorelai is cuter then ever! Amy Sherman Paladino is a true master of the comedy.I give GG season 6 a four for the missing subtitles not the acting and the story wich is a brilliant as ever!
3,left hanging,we were happy with the price and delivery time. everything was great until we got to the 5th disc and it didn't have the correct episodes on it-it was identical to the 6th disc. so we missed out on 4 episodes-big episodes. they claimed this product was new. you can take your chances but i won't order from them again.
3,No English Subtitles,"Not going to critique the show, but as for the disc set, this one is disappointing. The overlapping layout is not practical. The lack of CC/English subtitles, is really annoying. Isn't Closed Captioning just standard?"
3,gilmore girls - season 6,"i was disappointed with Amazon as discs 5 and 6 did not work on my dvd player and when i raised this with customer service, they would not allow me to return the set as we had already watched discs 1-4 - incredibly disappointing service"
2,Very poorly put together season!!!,"Why in the world does season 6 lack English subtitles??? Just does not make sense to me how they were left off season 6 and included in 1-5 and 7??? Warner Brothers should be ashamed. I would love to get some activist group for disabled people to go after them. I am sure there are viewers that require English subtitles in order to enjoy this wonderful series. So I guess they will just have to miss out on an entire season.Then besides the English subtitle issue, I too do not like the new packaging where it has 3 pages and one disc on each page is buried under the other, so you have to remove one to get to the other - very bad design and I can not imagine it was any cheaper to manufacture.Still I could not give this 1-star because I love the series so much. The series is 5-star all the way but the packaging and lack of English subtitles makes me want to give this product 1-star."
3,The worst,"For me this was one of the worst seasons of Gilmore Girls. Creatively it went nowhere. Every episode ended making you wonder what happened...nothing. And Rory was acting very unRorylike in many ways. If you're desperate for more of the girls and have nowhere else to turn, watch it in reruns on TV. Otherwise, there are far better DVD episodes to choose from."
3,Missing the old DVD ways,"I won't give you a synopsis of the season because the review is about the DVD's not about Gilmore Girls themselves. I was disappointed with season six. I have all five other seasons, and loved the extras as well as the subtitles in English since I am hard of hearing. The regular TV captions take up too much space on the screen so it can be hard to see what is happening on the episode. I was disappointed by the way they placed the DVD's in the case with two overlapping. You have to take one out to put back the other all while balancing them both, and hoping you don't scratch them. The only ""extra"" that they had was a glimpse of the new shows on CW, and a glimpse of the some of the new DVD seasons coming out. I hope that for season seven they go back to the old DVD ways with the English subtitles, extras, and the old DVD case. The season itself was wonderful, the DVD collection was not.If you are like me, and look forward to the extras then don't waste your money."
3,No Extras to speak of,"I missed much of this season because of a conflict in schedule. Glad to have the episodes but that is all it is. No extras, no Gilmoreisms and really long tracks."
3,Could have been better,"Love Gilmore Girls, but this was my least favourite of all Seasons. I could say a lot, but don't want to ruin it for anyone else! ;-) let's hope Season 7 is a goodie! :-)Christopher..GrRRrrpurrr"
5,gilmore girls- the complete sixth season,"I loved this season! I missed the shows when they aired so this was perfect to catch me up! My mom and I were both addicted to these DVDs. It was hard to stop watching it!! I love this show and this season made me love it even more. It was definetly my favorite. Go out and buy it now, catch up on the girls we love : ) I promise you'll love it!"
3,Worst Season of the Best Show On TV,"I have to agree with the majority here. This was the worst season of the best show on TV. None of the main characters were themselves this year (save Emily and Richard). I kept waiting for the strong, independent women I grew to love to watch from week to week to return. They never did.The only reason I am even considering buying this season is for two reasons: The return of Jess and so I can have a complete collection. And honestly, I am still considering simply watching the first 5 seasons, when the Gilmore Girls were themselves."
5,More Gilmore!,"This is a great TV Series. Season 6 is filled with the lightning qucik wit from these beautiful woman. It is great fun.There are some more serious moments in this season, but they do spice up the watching.I highly recommend this for all demographics!"
4,Great show,"I am a long-time fan of Gilmore Girls and enjoy the show. The sixth season was not the best, however---you can tell the series is starting age and run out of material. However, the wit and humor is still there."
3,Great series...poor dvd set,"As usual, the episodes are great. The Box itself is, as most reviewers already stressed out, not.The absence of any specials aside (specials have never been the GG box sets strong side...), the missing of english subtitles is just a pure insolence."
1,still not delivered,until now the DVD is not delivered. Perhaps you can inform me when I can expect it. Thanks and greetings from germany
