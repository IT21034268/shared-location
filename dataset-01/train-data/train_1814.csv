2,Failed at both,Tim Burton tried to make this funny and scary and failed at both things. Do yourself a favor and skip it.As a sidenote. Why did everyone in the 1970's dress as if they had lost a bet that involved them dressing like clowns for the day?
4,great movie,i honitly think it was a great pg-13 movie and i would also sugest it for kids over 10it had some blood put for the famalies that dont mind it i think it would be great for one of thoes friday night movies
4,"Good movie, but too few extras.","I would give Dark Shadows the movie 5 Stars, but this disk only 4.Tim Burton's more modern take on the basic story from the soap opera (which has changed very little) is quite satisfying. Johnny Depp's Barnabas Collins is hilarious, but still a very sympathetic character. His need to kill seems a sad, little foible. I found myself dismayed and amused by my lack of sympathy for his victims. Sorry, Tim, but I found the only disappointing casting decision (or character concept) to be your usually note perfect spouse, Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Hoffman, She was frequently humorous, but totally unconvincing.Eve Green was spot on as the evil Angelique, who was always my fav in the original show. She's more beautiful as a brunette, but just as talented as a blonde.I just wish there were a commentary with Tim & Johnny. Since I'm not getting it, I'll throw in Danny Elfman, who did his usual marvelous job on the score."
4,Fun,"This is one of those slightly off beat but fun films. Not great but fun to watch. Johnny Depp is his usual self, very entertaining."
4,Funny and entertaining,Never saw the soap opera back in its day. But I can see why it was a cult hit. Enjoyable but not sure if a sequel is needed
3,Entertaining bit of flush,"Made for a nice movie night rental - a bit of fluff. Some nice laughs, especially early on when Depp first returns from the grave. Johhny Depp,as usual, transforms himself into another character worth watching."
3,Okay flull for a rainy day,"I was surprised that I didn't find this movie more interesting. The actors are all good especially Michelle. I think they good have had a bit more 'give and take' comedy betweeen the present and the past(Johnny Depp). Of course, I wish there was more Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter. So, it was okay."
3,Dark Shadows,"Not as good as I was expecting, you would think with such an all star cast it would have been better."
2,Watch it once type of film when there is nothing else on,"I actually made the mistake of buying this film because Amazon didn't have it available for rent at the time and my elderly grandmother really wanted to see it. Afterwards she complained that it wasn't a good movie. :-/ Sometimes Johnny Depp is great (i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean) - this isn't one of those time. If you are looking for a film that you can zone out to (or watch while reading a more interesting book) and maybe get a couple of mild laughs out of, this is it. However, it is otherwise entirely predictable - all of the conclusions are forgone, and you find yourself hoping for it to be over with already. I wish I could get my money back."
1,I tried to Watch Dark Shadows,"I don't usually write movie reviews. This deserves my input. I wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, no one wanted to make a movie about Barnabas Collins I would like to watch.The premise was there. So much potential, yet somehow this hot mess of a movie tossed it out the window. Performances? Meh, okay. Great actors? Yes, most certainly. Storyline that allowed the movie goer something, anything that would make the characters something to care about? Nope.I paid to watch this. I would not recommend this movie. Bad, not in a good-bad movie way. Just bad."
4,good,not Jonny's best but up in the top ten. . .Could have used alittle more of the original show. .At my age it was hard to watch when you grew up with the original. .
3,Tongue-in-Cheek Violence,"Entertaining but not the blockbuster it should have been with the Star-power available in the movie. A little too ""campy"" for my taste. It 'nonchalants' the killing of innocents and has some gratuitous violence that's not necessary to support the plot line. I couldn't give it four (4) stars because it does not come across as a cut above average."
3,Not what I expected,I have never seen the original series but I assumed Dark Shadows would be pretty good based on those associated with the film. I felt the movie was okay until the climactic portion of the film. It seemed like the last 30 minutes of the film was spent trying to wrap up subplots in a hurried and somewhat sloppy manner. Too bad because it could have been better!
3,So-so,"This was an okay movie. However, I'm not a fan of Tim Burton type movies, so thats why the mid rating!"
3,"It's Not the Best, It's Not the Worst","Unfortunately, all of the interesting moments in the movie are in the trailer. Johnny Depp is perfect for the role, but the script didn't have enough of the dry wit displayed in the trailer. It's not the best movie I've ever seen and it not the worst. It's just OK."
3,Sorta Fun Movie,"I enjoyed this movie, even though it was mildly yawn-worthy. It's like Disney meets vampires and witches, rather than the dark comedy of the original series. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something to watch and can't think of anything else to see, and if you like Johnny Depp and Tim Burton style movies. It's not Beetlejuice for sure, but it's also not terrible"
3,"Moderately Entertaining, But Very Uneven","If film's had emotions, Dark Shadows would be slightly confused. At times the movie is trying to be a spooky and gothic chiller, mixing horror with suspense. The next minute it's trying to be a comedy with old jokes and goofy attitudes. Depp, as always, is a pleasure to watch, the supporting cast is entertaining as well, but it just can't make up for the unevenness of the movie's tone. It's not a horrendous movie by any means but it certainly has issues. Check this one out if you like previous Burton and Depp films."
4,Review of Dark Shadows,I remember the original Dark Shadows from the 1960's when it was kinda like a soap opera and came on everyday for 30 minutes and it was good.. and the 1990's version wasn't bad either.. I did like this version of Dark Shadow even though it was more comedy that the dark horror that was once Dark Shadows.. But still a good movie and Johnny Depp's portrayal of Barnabas Collins was really good.
5,Dark shadows,Love Depp and saw the original series but never undertood the story background until this movie arrived. Tim Burton and wife are also important to cast and the black humor continues.
2,Dumb and gorey,Dark Sahdows. I am a fan of Johnny Depp and this was a poor example of his work. I thought it was unncessisarily gory.
2,Better Luck Next Time,"It's ok but a little disappointing. Tim Burton has a tendency to go too far from the original product on remakes. He did so with Planet of The Apes, which was even a greater disappointment. In his treatment of Dark Shadows, it was too obvious that Barnabas Collins was a creature of the night and no mystery that he was a vampire. Johnny's makeup from the get go was pasty white. Johnny has always picked parts that are off color. That is why I like him, but I was hoping he would have been a little more enigmatic with the character as Jonathan Frid was in the sixties TV soap opera. And maybe that was what was missing from the film. It should have retained a ""soap opera"" trait about it. It does seem to be left open for a sequel. Let's just hope if there is one, that it will be more exciting to watch."
4,okay,"This was a good movie, it was different and we watched it a couple of times and that was enough."
4,Another Good Entertaining Burton Film,"I'm not a fan of cheesy campy films with alot of makeup which alot of people make this out to be but you have to admit it's an art to making a film that is just that, but still entertains and Burton always delivers on that note. Another thing that's in all his films is an all-star cast, alot of people don't know Eva Green but she really is a great actress who hasn't seen any great roles just yet. If you rented a burton film expecting anything other than quirky you probably have no place reviewing this title anyways. I wouldn't buy this movie, but that's true of 90% of films i've seen.....bottom line, this movie delivers exactly what it's supposed to and if you wanted to see an action film by ridley scott you should go watch that instead of rating this when you don't even like the genre. If you like this genre or director you will probably like the movie, the one-liners were perfectly placed for a comedy and the entire cast had time to shine. Eva Green is HOT !"
1,Terrible.,"Tim Burton movies are always hit or miss & this one's a stinker. Too many big name actors in this & why does Depp have to look so ridiculous? I tried twice to get through it,finally made it & was left with blank expression & zero connection to this sorry attempt at comedy horror. Mr. Burton,please Try making an original movie with no big actors,especially Johnny Depp(it's enough already!) next time & I might just check it out but I'll pass on anymore of these big,slick overblown Burton ego extravaganzas that have no heart & soul at all,Even if it was just $1.20 @ the redbox."
2,Disappointing!,"Saw this at the theater and wasn't too thrilled. I loved the original show. But this was just okay. I couldn't decide if this was supposed to be a comedy or drama. More comedy would have been great. Or all drama would have been great. But the mixture of the two was not so well done in this movie. Being a Depp fan and a fan of the original Dark Shadows, I will be purchasing the DVD in hopes that after I've watched it again, I may find what was missing at the theater. Who knows? Maybe my popcorn was bad and tainted my judgment!"
3,Great movie but the suggestive sex acts are thrown in awkwardly,I like clean funny movies. Call me old fashioned. I don't even mind fast forwarding through a scene or two. With this movie they were thrown in so awkwardly and overly bold it just trashed up a great film.
3,Kind of silly,"The movie was not really up to Johnny Depp par. It was ok, but weird story line. I would not want to see again."
3,3/5,It was an okay movie and plus it had Johnny Depp! I guess I was just expecting a little bit more comedy is all.
3,all right,"I've never seen the show this movie was based off, so I am judging this movie solely based on its own merit. Final verdict? It's not a bad movie at all, but it's not great either. I have to be honest, I found it campy. If you like camp, great, get this movie. I did find parts of the plot to be intriguing, so I can't say this is a terrible film, it's just not for everyone and the success of this film for you is on your personal tastes."
1,old saf T pops,I was very disappointed by the candy itself. The suckers are so old that the plastic sticks to the candy and the top layer of the candy is sort of sticky and mushy. these are not fresh by any means. Would like a refund.
1,"POOR LIGHT OUT PUT,","WELL I THOUGHT THE 30 LEDS AND THE 40 DOLLAR PRICE TAG WOULD MAKE THIS THE BEST LANTERN ON THE CAMPGROUND. FIRST I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THE BOX IT CAME IN, ,, MADE IN CHINA, WHICH MEANS CHEAP. lOOKS NICE AND ITS WEIGHS NOTHING, BUT THE LIGHT OUTPUT HIGH/OR LOW, IS TERRIBLE. I HAD A HARD TIME SETTING UP MY TENT WITH THE LANTERN NEXT TO ME.IT HAD NEW BATTERIES. IF YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO HANG THIS OFF A TREE AND LIGHT UP YOUR CAMPSITE YOUR NOT GONNA BE HAPPY.IN SUMMARY,- TOO EXPENSIVE, NOT VERY BRIGHT/OR IS THE LIGHT VERY THROUGH, , THE BLUEISH LED COLOR ACTUALLY MAKES IT HARDER TO SEE. YOU WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF WITH A FLOURESENT OR PROPANE LANTERN, AND IT WOULD COST THE SAME OF LESS."
4,Tells the truth that Christian conspiracies hide.,"If you want to find out just how dangerous Christianity can be, READ THIS BOOK."
1,Not Impressed,"I just received this book today. Once I opened it, I realized that it was way too small. Only about 5""x5"". There are NO fillintheblanks. Just small pages with topics written in at the top. I would like something a little bit more structured. I would not suggest getting this book, unless you have an extremely creative mind."
5,not your typical baby book,"This is a journal for new parents based on a 1930's French book. It is to be written in instead of the traditional paste a few pictures of the baby book. Not for the ""scrapbooker"" but certainly for the discerning parent. This certainly sounds esoteric but the book is beautiful. The drawings are typical of the 1930's. This book was once available through the Metropolitan Museum and I immediately thought of it when my own grand nephew was born. They no longer carry it and I was pleasantly surprised to find it here."
1,Folio Case,"We had problems with this order and Amazon was not much help in reconciling it. For some reason they sent us a conformation that it was shipped with another item and then a couple days later, they said it was returned. It was never shipped and all the shipping info was correct. The problem was they never had the case in stock to start with so said it was returned instead. They were not good to work with. I had to reorder the other item buy itself.I ended up buying the case somewhere else and paying more for it. :("
2,"No, it's not ""in stock""","I ordered both a Samsung K5 and a Belkin folio case for it on Feb 4, 2007. Both were said to be ""in stock."" Then I waited.A week later, I checked ""where's my stuff?"" and it said the items weren't due to ship until late March. I cancelled the K5 and found one elsewhere, which arrived within a week.As for this folio case, it still says ""in stock"" on its Amazon webpage but my cart now says it'll ship sometime in late March or April...two full months after the order.I get the feeling I'm never going to see this folio case and will have to cancel this part too.Hey, if it's not in stock, tell me. Worse, how come Samsung doesn't sell a case for their own K5 player?"
2,"Hmm, i still love them though but they're pushin' it.","I got this DVD at a show of theirs in Vancouver. I mean this was after they'd signed to Fat and I'd seen them before and I thought they were amazing but I don't know, this whole DVD and honestly the new album too seems just like an apology for them selling themselves out. It seems like a real issue for them still because i guess it's a case of them protesting too much. I don't care that they've started to suck of late because I know they were pretty special at one time so I'll forgive them, but maybe this is the closest thing you'll get to seeing Against Me! as what they were because lets face it, if you go to one of their shows these days it'll be in a big venue full of sycophantic faddy kids. Shame."
4,Delightful romp with interesting characters at class reunion,"Jane Jeffrey, intrepid housewife and part-time murder investigator, comes face to face with her friend Shelley's old high school friends. All of these characters were members of the Ewe Lambs, an exclusive club during their school days. When the most disliked member is murdered, Jane and Shelley suspect one, then another, of the classmates. Each character is delightfully sketched out and their interactions are interesting and sometimes unpredictable. This is light and enjoyable reading."
5,Curl up with this delightful book and enjoy to the end!,"Class reunions: the time when the real characters of classmates come out! Thought the shy girl in your class room would remain so? Oh, no! Thought the really pretty one with no brains would be as stunning as always? NOT! Thought the fantastic personality would never do anything like commit murder? GUESS AGAIN!!!! Sit down with this delightful book, Ramsey Lewis turned down low, and a good cup of Lapsang Souchong. You WILL enjoy!!"
3,This tape is ok,It took forever to get this tape that I had to go out and buy some at the store. I have not used this since there is no need right now so I don't know how good it is. Maybe I will revisit this and change the rating once an occasion arise that I must use it.
3,Choba B CCCP,An ok album but nothing great other than summertime. too much reverb on the mike for most songs. it's a listen to once album and not much more. it will basically sit on my shelf as a conversation piece and not much else.it's too bad there was no way to listen to any of the other tracks before purchase.
5,Good quick book.,"I heard about this book from work of mouth from another med student who is currently doing AIDS research in East Africa. As a soon-to-be medical student and someone who has traveled to some of the places mentioned, I found this book interesting and affirming. He includes some of his opinions about Africa and the nature of his work that made it personal. One small point that I found especially interesting was that he (a plastic surgeon) seems to place reconstructive and ""cosmetic"" surgery (such as elective breast augmentation on a man or breast reduction on a woman with unequally sized breasts) on a somewhat equal plane - as one might expect a plastic surgeon to do. While I don't really agree, his argument was thought-provoking. I highly recommend this book."
5,"This book is a ""God send""","This book is a ""must have"" for every Unix user. At our office we have in the past created ""cheat sheets"" for Unix users in the event that our administrator is not around. This book covers everything that a user needs to know and more. I found the chapter on problem solving to be extremely useful. I plan to recommend that all of the Unix users in our office get a copy of this book."
1,Unsuitable for its stated purpose,"Despite the title and the seller's statement that this item is fully functional as a wax seal, it is not.It suffers from two principle problems:1.) Contrary to the picture, the low relief portions of the seal have been filled with some type of dark enamel to increase contrast. This enamel sticks STRONGLY to wax, resulting in either the enamel coming out on the seal or the wax adhering to seal. Either way it is impossible to get a good impression.2.) The metal used for this seal softens in hot wax, causing the design to distort.This might be a nice piece of costume jewelry, but it is not a wax seal by any stretch."
3,Not an effective wood treatment,I was hoping to use this as a wood bleech/restorer but it didn't really seem to be effective in that application.
5,great pure and simple,I think the fundamentalist bible boy (macdonald douglas) is completely wrong it is simple sometimes but over all i think it is great and creative the dialogue which he says is stupid is funny so get this game.
4,First RPG Game I Played-,"Besides Poke'mon (which isn't a /rea/ rpg thing --) This was the first RPG I played. I had gotten it Christmas, when I was 9. It took me /3/ years to beat. I put it down after I couldn't beat the final boss. It's incredbly fun to play though, great grahics and awsome characters. (Go Nall!)"
4,great game but not so challenging,"this game is pretty easy to beat(especially the last boss),and the characters talk way to much,but it has a good storyline.*challenging 8/10*long hours of gameplay(compared to the other games that I have played on the gba)7/10*graphics 10/10(the characters are soooooooooo cute I just want to hug them to death)*storyline 8/10"
4,Highly Over-rated,"A friend let me borrow this game claiming it was really great. I played it through expecting the game to get interesting. It didn't.-the game is not challenging in any way-the game consists of tons of meaningless leveling mixed with a few extremely easy bosses (with a pathetically easy boss at the end of the game)-predictable storyline-random battles happen every 3 seconds or so...it gets very tiresome-areas/puzzels are easy enough for a young child to beat-character dialog is immature... the target audience must be eight year olds-the game is highly linear. You move from task to task with zero exploration of the world. Weapons are gained in an easy and predictable fashion-the graphics are fairly decent, which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1.....that and it has a fairly amusing story line with cool anime.I would recommend this game to children grades 1 through 6. Anyone older need not waste their time or money."
3,Fun but too easy,"I thouroughly enjoyed the first 10 hours of the game. The game is very reminiscent of the Final fantasy Series. The skills are interesting and so are the characters. The story is original and involving, it draws you in. The only gripes I have about this game is that it was too easy and some of the dungeons are so ""mazey"" that they are annoying. I don't like spending 2 hours in a dungeon becuase a map is needed to properly navigate it. My short term memory is not that good. The battles posed no challenge for me, none. Not even one boss battle, therefore, I never finished the game because I was dissapointed. If you don't mind an easy game, then pick this up. If you want a game that challenges you in the battles then stay away from this one."
3,Difficult to put on without scratching aluminum grip frame,"I had some minor difficulty installing the grip and wound up with some scratches on the grip frame, which are now hidden by the grip. The grip fits well and is much more comfortable on the hand while shooting than the factory wood grips."
3,Instructions could be better.,You need to line up the pin that is already on the grip with the channel in the grip. There is also a pin or the stirrup which I confused for this pin in the instructions. Better pictures would have made this more clear.Even after applying a lot of force I was unable to completely get rid of the gap between the grip and the frame on the top of the backstrap. The grip does feel nice though and I'm looking forward to shooting it.
3,Couldn't get a good fit on my .357 Blackhawk,"I followed all the directions, but I couldn't get the grips to mount solidly on my Blackhawk. No matter how I shimmed and adjusted, the grips still wanted to rotate backwards. That's a pity, as I really liked the way they feel in my hand, too. Might try the Pachmayr grips next."
4,Quality product fits .327 Blackhawk,"Bought these grips for a .327 Magnum Ruger Blackhawk. It wasn't specifically listed as a supported pistol (probably due to how recently the .327 came out), but it worked. I had to put some cardboard spacers in and just use the small pin on the bottom clip to get the grips to fit perfectly. I was able to leave the stock alignment pin in. Add some proper spacers to the package and I would give it 5 stars. They look sharp and feel great in your hand. They're a vast improvement in comfort over the stock wooden grips."
1,Poor Vendor,"This item was never shipped by the vendor. This vendor did not respond to repeated emails, This vendor should be used on a limited basis."
5,Get A Grip....,"Hogue Rubber Grip Ruger Blackhawk/Single Six Rubber MonogripGood Price, Quick Delivery, Fit is Great....Great product that works....Makes the gun much easier to hold and aim, would recommend this to friends."
1,blount88,"I love hogue products i have these grips on several handguns, i gave this 1 star because it looked to be a return item. the actual grip package inside the shipping box had been open and the mounting screw was stripped out...NOT i huge deal i just went to my local hardware store and found a match. but be sure to check all parts the same day you recieve them... BUT hogue is a great product and now after getting another screw i love the grips."
2,Don't buy this product,"The blades are not sharp enough to even clip my 11 week old kitten's nails. It split his nails and left behind small jagged edges on his claws. The design makes it look like a small torture device, making my kitty even more frightened by it."
3,"Very cheap, still work.","The plastic guard to keep the clippers closed when I am not using them broke the first time I tried to use the clippers. They clipped my cat's nails fine, though they could have been a bit sharper. These are cheap but functional. One note is that the in-store package had already been opened, and then the clippers were just slid back in under the plastic. A little fishy, but they do the job and I don't reall care."
2,Talk about over Rated,This album got played out in one week .The Slower songs and slow raps are terrible and Scrabs just flat out sucks BAD. SOL is tight on F--K Halloween and on Dollhouse but thats about it for these guys.I gave it two stars for two alright songs.
5,Good book for PC techs,"I found the book to be clearly written and at a difficulty level somewhere between the ""dummies"" books and the engineering-level textbooks. I liked the extensive photos, drawings and schematics. Another nice touch were the ""color plates"" with color photos of some of the essential hardware items. All-in-all, a very useful reference book for the modern PC technician, or those interested in learning more about basic electronics as it applies to PCs and related equipment."
4,Power connection,A great resource for any computer/ electrician technician. Will defintly buy another one soon as my previous order was a gift
1,I HATE IT!,"I made an error in this purchase. It wasn't what I had been looking for, and it's too much of a hassle to return and item."
1,Another snapped knife,"I received a set of these knives as a gift about 3 years ago. My blade snapped just as described in the other reviews. I saved the snapped pieces for a while, but decided I probably wouldn't follow through with what was likely to be a difficult customer service experience (didn't have any proof of purchase, etc.). Went on today to order a replacement, and realized that 1) this was a very generous gift (thanks Mom, and now I wish I'd kept the pieces) and 2) any replacement I ordered would be subject to the same problem. This is disappointing since I'd like to have a knife that matches the rest of the set."
2,Mine snapped too!,"Similar to the other reviewer, my knife snapped in two pieces, on the blade, just above the handle, while cutting a red potato. This knife has a ""lifetime warranty"" so we'll see if JA Henckels comes through. This is a good-looking, well-balanced knife. But it seems like it shouldn't have snapped, even after 5-years of use."
3,4 inch paring knife,"I thought this was a really sharp knife and easy to use for small cutting. However, after 1 year, it snapped in half when I was using it to cut cheese. I am trying to get it replaced!"
5,Possibly the greatest psychological primer ever.,"Brief and well written for the average reader. Leading in comprehension and clearity, Fritz builds a solid foundation with simple common concepts that allow the reader to connect from/to several areas of expertise. He identifies most stumbling blocks to ""modern"" thought and presents the humble truth of humanity and our ridiculous inheritance.But, all is not lost. Provided is a means to gradually lift yourself out of the pit of neurosis, if you have the courage."
5,Great item,well built (in the US?) - does the job well!The side with the little ball helps in tight spots.Had another set of hex wrenches before and this blows them out of the water.
5,Good strong wrenches,"Bondhus came up with a good idea when they designed the ball-end Allan wrench! These are fairly complete sets of high-quality tools. I haven't twisted or rounded any yet, and if they can stand up to the way I use them, they must be good!!"
1,unnecessarily negative and dark,"Whew! After having read this book the only strong feeling I had was relief! Why is all the recommended, award-winning literature for children so depressing and dark? Isn't anyone writing children's literature anymore that have happy, or at least hopeful endings? This book never explains why Paul is so angry, other than the fact that his brother has Downs Syndrome. If Paul were my child, I would be looking for other reasons, as well. He is a totally one-dimensional character in this book, and I for one could never conjure up any compassion for him. This book is just not real, and the author needs to do more research about today's expectations for people with DS. They certainly go to school before age 7, and not to ""trade school."" What is that??? This book was a total waste of my time!!! Yuk!"
4,good little book,"i just finished this book and thought even though it's a bit on the dark side it was a great read. the mistake people make with this book is that they focus on the Jacob, the down syndrome child, and that not the case. the story is about Pual the older brother and his feelings for jacob,and although there not good feelings there real and thats what the auther is trying to gat across. if you come at this book with an open mind you will enjoy it and get the meaning of the book."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Note that this gasket has adhesive on one side for easier installation. No drama with the install.The gaskets are very thin. They come in a pack of ten, which, I guess the buyer should beware of anything this cheap. Four times I put one on the tStat housing, each time coolant still leaked. When I pulled the tStat housing off to replace the gasket I had just put on, it was this wet mess, like wet newspaper, with no integrity. Shouldn't the designers have expected that this thing would come into contact with coolant????I did all sorts of RTV applications to protect the gasket and provide a seal. Nothing worked. I got a thick gasket. Leak solved.These gaskets are only good for a tech school that teaches gasket replacement. I can pull a Ford 302 thermostat housing off in 5 minutes thanks to this gasket (including removing the serpentine belt). (I have had so much practice.)For a car your family depends on, find another gasket."
3,Not slick - but good information,"There have been some very cool running films in recent years. Nova's Marathon Challenge is a documentary with tons of good info and polished prime time quality camera work. This is not like that. This is a coach giving you the straight talk on a simple approach to running with good form. The clips of athletes demonstrating are quite amateurish and the suggested drills seem almost silly. However, there are animations that are very clear and over-all the package gets the point across. I tried employing the ideas on the treadmill, was faster and had a whole new set of pain in muscles I had not been using effectively - I think this was worth the investment.After watching this I wanted to sit for an hour and just watch top runners for their form. I suppose that's what YouTube is for. I recommend this if you are looking to understand running efficiency."
2,Evolution Running is not very instructive,"The Evolution Running DVD fell far short of my expectations. It does not provide a clear method to run in the way they say is best. For example, if you want to learn to swim freestyle, the video ""Fishlike Freestyle"" provides a sequence of drills that get you from the point of being a sloppy swimmer to swimming a very nice freestyle. However, if you are a heel strike runner, this video does not provide a realistic way to become a toe strike runner. The only male examples in the video that run ""correctly"" are super lean, super fit, top athletes who probably run that way naturally. I would have like to see the video take a normal person who is maybe 15 pound overweight and who is naturally a heel strike runner and effectively turn them into a toe strike runner. The instruction in the video doesn't do that."
5,Awesome value,Dont know they do it for the price. High quality Very useful. Would recommend to friends. In fact I have and they're also happy.
2,Poor Quality,"The ends of the three smallest sizes were ""lipped"" and required grinding to make them fit. Also the two smallest sizes had bent shanks. Either I was extreamly unluckly and got a ""monday morning job"" or these are seconds as I never had problems purchasing this brand in the past!"
4,"Unbelievable, yes, but an interesting sequel","I read the other reviews and I laughed. The plot is a bit wild, but enjoyable. If you liked the 1995 movie ""Sense and Sensibility"" with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, you will enjoy this book. If you're a rabid Austenite, well, stick with something else."
3,For the Monster Truck fan!,"My son wanted this game because he loves Monster Trucks. He got frustrated on ""normal"" mode, so we switched it to ""easy"" and he enjoys it a lot more because he can win. The graphics are pretty good, though not great, and the sound seems pretty realistic. I tried playing it and I enjoy doing the ""cash grab"" and ""points"" mode. Death match is a little harder since you have to be the only truck left standing when time is up. I don't really like the save feature. It appears to save the file based on your progress and doesn't give you the option of naming your saved file. If more than one person wants to keep track of what they are doing, you just have to save your file to a different memory card, I guess."
5,The right item to replace my broken shaft...,"It's the replacement for the broken shaft in my filter. My emergency jury rigged carbon fiber shaft that I purchased from the hobby store is still going strong, but I'll be switching to this one as the permanent fix."
5,Shaft & Bushings for Eheim Filter,These shafts break after a while and they are very hard to find. It can put you in a real bind when the filter on a fish tank goes out. I was very lucky to find them on Amazon.
4,Contains all of his best hits,"This album contains all of Al Stewart's best hits including a few live tracks lifted from his Indian Summer live album. Highlights include Year Of The Cat (one of the greatest all time songs), On The Border, Time Passages, Song On The Radio, Running Man and Merlin's Time. A good album to buy if you're looking for a single representative album of Al Stewart's best work."
3,Not a Great Value,"There's nothing wrong with this knife. Frankly though, it doesn't cut fruits and vegetables any better than a $5 serrated knife from Chicago Cutlery.The handle is a bit more comfortable than cheaper knives, but the design of the blade doesn't seem to offer much advantage when cutting."
3,Divine Brown,"I thought this was going to be a real interesting documentary and story, but it was short with only a couple of good moments in it. If I had seen this before I bought it, I probably would not have purchased it. On a good note it was just a little R rated."
2,2 burned out within 3 months,"I bought this replacement heater for my Pace soldering/de-soldering work station. The first one burned up the second time I used it. I called and they sent me a replacement and after about 10 uses it burned up also. I only use this station 1-2 times a week so it is not even getting heavy use. The last heater I had lasted 6 years, these didn't last at all. In my case it was an expensive replacement for 10 uses."
5,Hooked at the Intro....,"I picked this book up at a friends and was hooked right at the intro. It starts off as a simple story about growing up with subtle awareness and takes you on the journey of Life. With true jewels for growth and awareness hidden in plain sight as simple realizations I read this book like it was a travelogue for the Soul, or a memory enhancer for the heart, and when I'd finished wanted to start again... But I gave it to an 85 year old friend who reads voraciously and she told me... "" I was hooked at the Intro and was twenty pages deep before I looked around to see where I was""..."
1,"Life Has Drama, Why Watch on TV?","By chance, all the characters are well-off, attractive people who suffer through drama, immaturity, irresponsibility, and one dimensional personalities. They appear ungrateful and make a big deal about the little things. How can the average young man and woman truly accept these people? The characters of 90210 don't suffer the realities of most Americans. Are they trying to mock the rest of society with their luxurious, CA lives. The apathy and vanity in our society has to end somewhere. You mistakenly slept with him or her, fine, confess and MOVE ON. Isn't that what life is about?"
3,Disks are scratched,I've watched this season before when I borrowed it from a friend. I loved it so much I figured Id buy the season myself. When I went to watch it the first disk skipped the entire episode and wasn't capable of being watched. I'm hoping the other disks aren't like the first one.
4,Teens these days,"Ohh man, drama central. I love this show. I loved the original back in its day but this one is just as awesome!"
2,"Yeah, I don't think so..","This was so painful to watch and the characters were difficult to care for. It was up and down, it was good and bad, and it was over and out. The stories were anticlimactic. Here's some advice for all of the people on this series: go hard or go home."
2,Skip everything up to the last 2 episodes.,"Being a fan of the original 90210, I was looking forward to the new version. But it was dreadful, a complete train wreck. The characters were not interesting, the writing awful. My wife continued to watch after I gave up 3 episodes in, so I would catch parts of each episode. But the Prom and after-Prom finale was an example of bad TV that can entertaining. Not on the same level as the original, or my pick for best teen show of all time, The OC, but looking forward to how they start off season 2."
1,WHY DID THE COMPLETE WORMS NETWORK REDO 90210,THIS SHOW IS A TRAVESTY.PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS NONSENSE.STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL WHICH HAS MORE FLAIR THAN THIS RIP-OFF.EVEN WORSE THE COMPLETE WORMS NETWORK ARE DO THE SAME THING WITH MELROSE PLACE AVOID THAT ONE AS WELL.LEAVE THESE SHOWS ALONE.
1,Cash-in,"This series are not bad for teens BUT it's not beverly hills.It's title is just cash-in to the popular true beverly hills series.just because one or two original actors returned and the title is ""beverly hills"" does not mean it's the same series.i would love to see a continuation of the old series with brandon, kelly and the rest of the gang living now as adults and not some new kids who have nothing to do with the original series.STOP REMAKING CLASSICSGIVE US CONTINUATIONS OF THE OLD SERIES WE LOVE WITH THE SAME ACTORS WE USED TO KNOW.Enough said"
3,"Same Zipcode, Different Style","As a fan of Beverly Hills, 90210 I find the new show interesting. Some faces from the original are in the new show, namely Kelly, Brenda, Jackie (Kelly's mother who is in just a few episodes), and Erin aka Silver (Kelly and David's half-sister). The show focuses on the Wilson family- mom, dad, daughter Annie (Darcy from Degrassi The Next Generation), and son Dixon (The Wire, The Secret Life of Bees). Storylines involve drugs, rehab, a teenage pregnancy, relationships, as well as a ton of other topics that today's teens can relate to. While the show is good, it isn't nearly as good as the FOX hit of the 1990s. Beverly Hills, 90210 will always be more superior in my opinion."
4,Worth the penny. but..........,No spare screws provided. Threads for the screws got loosen. So now i am unable to focus properly. There is small design flaw.
2,Pretty tedious,"I thought this would never end. It's an attempted throwback film, I guess, but I wasn't interested in the period sets or dress, and the dialogue was forced to be witty. There is no chemistry between Zellweger and any of the men she tries to woo, including Kevin Bacon, the bandleader scallawag husband she leaves in a huff. Though it's told through the eyes of one of her two sons, neither one was interestingly drawn as a character. I'm surprised this is vintage 2009. It seems older and more dated. I cannot recommend this."
2,Not the best book for children,"The story of MUSE is cute, a little simplistic and very much on the level of a young child, but sadly, the writing style is very overwrought, using very little punctuation and seemingly random rules of grammar.It is more like a high school free form writing assignment gone awry than an actual novel and the writer would do well with a strong editor.I don't think this is the best example of the type of writing we would like small children to encounter. It will at best be confusing and at worst lead to poor writing habits amongst the younger ones."
1,I couldn't get past the grammar mistakes,"Call me picky but I just could not get through this book. Yes the premise was cute but it boggled my mind that all of the names were capitalized, there were serious grammar and style issues, and there was no spacing between paragraphs making the book look like one very long first chapter. It is an editor's nightmare. A word of caution for anyone who is dyslexic (like me) this was a very difficult read visually."
5,Skin Cream,"This product is the best I have ever used foir chapped damaged skin.I work outside and have always suffered from rough, cracked skin on my hands- this is one of the only products that has helped them heal- it is at the very lease worth a try to see if you get the same result!"
3,Intense & fast healing?,Didn't do much for me and it is pretty expensive. Next time I would stick to vitamins in capsules that you can break over and spread on skin.
5,Review of Steam Turbines by P. Shlyakhin,"This book is an English translation of the original Russian book. It was translated by Dr. A. Jaganmohan - retired Professor from Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India. The English translation flows very smoothly and, so makes the reading very easy. The book mainly describes Russian practises in designing and building steam turbines that was being followed during late 1950s and 1960s. The units used in the book are Metric (and not SI). The book describes both the theoretical principles and the construction details. But, let us be realistic - the fundamental principles of steam turbines have not really changed since the time of writing the book. So, the book is still relevant even today. The book is quite well illustrated. The book used to be used as a textbook for Graduate classes on Turbomachinery at IIT Mumbai. But, I am of the opinion that the book will be more useful for a practising Engineer than for a College Graduate student."
4,Good read,Good book. I like how it's chapter by chapter about a different era/person/crew from harlem. I recommend this book and I'm not even finished reading it yet....!
2,"looks good, works ok","I love the look of this clock radio. In terms of function, I find it burdensome to program and use. Too many button and features you have to ""click through"" to get to the place you want to modify. And the power cord slip out all the time. But it looks cool . . ."
3,Altec Lansing iM11,good for what you are paying for.don't thinkf the base is good for dance music...when you put ur volume up you'll hear some noise...it's good for normal medium music..practical and portable..works on battery.
3,"inMotion Mobile Speakers good, not great","I just purchased the iM11 inMotion Mobile Speaker system for my iPod. Price was good, ordering easy and the product was delivered promptly. Setup was simple, although figuring out which adapter to use was a little difficult because they're not labeled very well. Sound quality was good but the speakers get over-driven if you try to put the volume higher than about 3/4. That was disappointing, as at that volume it doesn't really carry beyond the room the unit it sitting in. If I had it to do again, I'd look at a slightly more expensive unit with stronger speakers. Still a good value for the money."
4,"Choices are Cheap, This, and Bose","Fits my 3 Gen and my Nano. Battery or AC, Nicely portable (most are not). Well designed. Simple controls. Recharges the battery when attached. Speakers will accept external inputs. Good music for an average size room but not at high volume, look elsewhere for a building shaker. And yes, they all seem to come out of the same factory in China. What you are buying is the name brand reputation should there be a problem."
1,Not exactly the item that was advertised,"According to the website, it's suppposed to charge any of the ipods (including ipod touch) while it is docked, it doesn't. I ended up returning it, as I really needed it to charge. I also had a problem with shipping. I had paid $7 in shipping when I ordered this item, I then got a postcard from the post office the shipping is due, apparently, the vendor did not pay the proper amount of shipping, so I had to pay an extra $7 to pick up the item. I emailed the vendor and they said they will reimburse me for the shipping, but I never saw the money.The item did not work out and I ended up paying $11 to ship it back. The vendor refunded me the $$, less the shipping I paid and they didn't. So, I'm out $25 for shipping and the item was $24. It's not worth the hassle for me to get my $7 back. Will never order from these people again."
2,it took two months,"I received this product for Christmas and was very pleased with the quality of sound. However, it has stopped working after less than two months. The support staff has been less than helpful determining what's wrong with it. It will still charge my iPod if I plug it in, but will not turn on to play music whether plugged into the wall or running off of batteries. While it was working, it sounded good (although I had a popping noise in-between songs with the video 30) and was so easy to take to work on casual day for tunes. I am disappointed it stopped working so quickly though. It isn't like it was carried everywhere or abused. It was transported in it's carrying case within a totebag once a week. The rest of the time, it was left plugged in at home. :("
3,"Decent sound for price, does not charge the Nano 4G","I ordered an iM11 for my daughter to go with her new iPod Nano 4G. It has decent sound for a speaker dock at that price level, but I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that it wont charge the Nano. I'll have to get my daughter a different unit and keep this one as a spare. Avoid this is you have the new skinny Nano 4G."
3,Low quality sound,"The sound is somewhat tingy and fairly low in quality. It does the job, however.In the future, I will stick with higher quality sound systems."
5,Perfect!,"I love these speakers. My old ones broke after a few months and I really wanted some new ones. I'm happy to say that these have not broken yet, as of three months after I bought them, and I think they'll last a lot longer.They do have a little click sound in between each song, but it really doesn't bother me."
2,Poor sound quality,"This product would be useful for an office or other small, enclosed area, but the volume and sound quality cannot handle much more. It is a nice size, however, and folds up easily. As far as the portability, it works great.I bought this to take with me to work, where we are outside quite a bit. You must be within 10 feet to hear anything at full volume, and certain songs become very distorted at that level.It's okay for now, but I wouldn't recommend to anyone looking for a moderately powerful speaker."
2,Disappointed with product,"Found that it does not charge the battery of the newest ipod nano, and the sound quality at higher volume becomes distorted. The small amount of saving was not worth the lost performance. Would recommend spending a bit more and getting a better product."
1,"I love this device, but the price hike is ridiculous","I love this device. It has good fidelity at office volumes, it is crazy portable, and it fits anywhere. Even at medium-high volume, it can fill a moderate sized room with no distortion. Not much bass at higher volumes, but what do you expect. The one star, however, is for the ridiculous price hike on this item. I bought this exact item three months ago for $36. And no, I'm not mixing up models; I got to this page by clicking the item name in the old order after I went to check the price. At $36, this was a fantastic deal, and an absolute no-brainer best available for the price. Up near $100, it starts to have a lot of company. And seriously, the chutzpah to jack the price by 100% is out of hand."
4,Portable IPod speaker,"The iM11 inMotion speakers are just what I was looking for. I teach classes and use music in them, and go from location to location. It's easy to travel with. It has more volume control which I needed. You do have to be careful not to hit the On/Off button after you have put it back in the carry case. I use the battery power and it does fine. The cord is a good back up if my batteries wear down."
3,Did not fit 4th gen ipod nano,"I tried every fitting they gave, but the 4th gen nano would not fit properly; it is still usable, but you get a flimsy hold to the docking bay without using the fitting. Don't know how it works with other ipod types, though."
3,Only a genealogy,"Be aware that this book contains only genealogical charts; there are no myths discussed in it. The charts are extensive, if not exhaustive, though."
5,I will never be without this again,"I don't know how, but this stuff really is as good as everyone says. I'm not a big fan of Pureology's other products, but this one gives me immediate results that nothing I've used comes close to. I have very thick, coarse hair that I'm working on getting healthy and this fakes that healthy look for me. It's amazing when you blow it dry or just leave it in to air dry. My holy grail!"
5,Great stuff!,Love this stuff. It make my hair so soft and silky...it is very hard to find. I love that It came quickly.
2,Does not work for all hair...,"I purchased this product after reading the 5 star ""stellar"" reviews. I have been looking for something to handle ""fly away & frizz"".I have hair wavy hair, medium length (2 inches past shoulders) that frizzes in the humidity of Florida. I used this product according to the directions, as well as other ways to see if I could get it to tame the frizzies. In the end, I found I needed to section off my hair & use ALOT of the product (anywhere from 8- 12 squirts). I also needed to style it with an iron (which actually helps frizz as those of you may know) in order for this to be effective (which was average effectiveness compared to using others on the market).Therefore, it seems for my type of hair (as well as length), this product does not work well. I may work best for people with short hair?"
5,quality combo square,"If you want a combo square that will last with much abuse for years this is the 1 for you , it has an exellent easy to read blade that takes abuse well. We have 6 of them in our fabricating shop .AND is as good as a starretT IMHO"
4,Good Resource,This book is great if you are interested in becoming a motivational speaker. It is easy to read and includes a wealth of information. Well worth the money...
4,Everything You Wanted to Know about Motivational Speaking,I was very pleased with this book. It answered all the questions I had to make a career in motivational speaking. It gave excellent references and ideas how to build a foundation to transition into this field.
5,Great trance selection,"If you enjoy Trance than this selection is perfect. Many excellent Trance vocals worthy of any Transaholic. By all means, get his for your collection."
5,Nightmusic 2 is great!,"This CD duo is really good. I personally prefer the 1st cd, as it has more songs with haunting female lyrics in it. The music is relaxing as it is good to listen to on long drives at night. I would recommend this to anyone who likes lighter electro-house music."
4,Great Mix,"Like one other review mentioned, it's a great car CD to listen to. The second CD is not bad but I prefer the first CD. Overall great choice to buy."
4,Night Music Vol 2 - A Big Thumbs Up!,"The Nightmusic Vol 2 is another great sounding cd. I give this cd a big thumbs up for its music content, and listen ability. It is kind of funny, but my preference of cd's from this series are as follows: Vol 3, Vol 2, and then Vol 1. Either way you slice it, you won't be disappointed. Trance music that is well produced for a perfect night of chill!To summarize:Volume one is what I would call the standard for which all others should try to exceed.Volume two is definitely more vocal of the series.Volume three is more complex in the music content.Enjoy."
4,Great album!!!!,This is the first Thrillseekers cd I bought and I've been hooked ever since. This album has good beats. You won't be dissapointed. I am a trance fanatic and I have a huge cd collection and this is one of my faves.
3,Not EVEN Close.....,I cannot even begin to imagine how the electronica dance genre is going anymore!! This cd(and I own the first one also-which I thought was AWESOME)is so dark it never even gets off the ground. Personally-I was hoping for more of that smae feel as their first disc. Oh well-So far this summer-AVB 2007-George Acosta's new one and now this---anyone going to bring back the happiness back to the dance floor?????
5,Thrillseekers deliver again!,"nice album:CD1: has new tracks, vary cool uplifting, music,exactly music for morning rush, when you wake up. or on friday evening.CD2: is a compilation of old but well known tracks. so basically guy <thrillseekers> just created perfect blend of new and old trance tracks.Thrillseekers just play trance, real trance music. Nice Job, guys!! Thanks"
4,Great Buy!,"This album is seriously very good. It's one of those great trance albums that you can listen to all the way through, and you never want to skip the track."
4,The Very Best,3 reason's why u should buy this cd.1. Born to be wild2. Magic Carpet Ride3.Cuz this cd is awesome.I just recently got this from a friend and all of their songs rock. I can't quit listening 2 it. I'd rather listen 2 this anyday than rap. Who else agrees?
5,Comprehensive in terms of the relevant research literature,The theoretical and research background presented in this book is excellent. A clear and concise discussion of all of the relelvant research supporting Goldstein's various interventions is given. The book does all this while staying focused on the cognitive-social-skills training of youth which is its subject.I wish I had found this book prior to doing my own research in aggression and anger management. It would certainly have made the lit. review a lot easier.
4,"Great sound, dissapointing 4:3 picture.","The sound quality is amazing, however I was very dissapointed when I popped the dvd in and it was 4:3.As always SYL is punshing, and canadian."
4,Useful background to medieval philosophy,"Written prior to the recent interest in medieval studies, this book still gives a fine introduction to the era, and explains the significance not only of the great Scholastics, but also of lesser known figures like Cassiodorus, Pseudo-Dionysius, John of Salisbury, and Siger of Brabant. Both the fundamental problematic of the Scholastic--to unite the deliverances of faith and reason, in accordance with the motto ""Credo ut intelligam""--and the attempts of different philosophers to carry out this project are detailed and explained clearly and in simple language. This book does not, however, discuss philosophical problems in any detail, and can only serve as a general introduction. Still, its brevity, clarity, and self-contained approach make it a good starting place for the philosopher interested in this topic."
4,Great to start with & short term use,"Great for the following: combined complex protein with creatine, help reach target daily calorie intake & good taste.I'm not a hard gainer so I can't tell if it is great for hard ones.Drawbacks: high cholesterol (that's why for short term use)"
4,Close to perfect,"The taste is perfect. No extremes in the taste to get sick of and this makes it perfect. Comes with plenty of servings and is highly soluble but doesn't mix 100%, but more like 90-95%. Can be difficult to clean if you mix it in glasses with corners on the bottom."
4,Fantastic,I have had Chocolate and vanilla ands both have awesome flavor and mixes great with Blender Bottle. Great ratio of Protein to Carbs and good value!
4,Halogen Desk Lamp,"Good quality lamp. I use it to illuminate my desk space between two computer monitors, so it is handy that the on-off toggle switch is located near the light instead of on the lamp base. Only qualm with it is that the arms bend downward toward the ground if you put any vertical pressure on the switch. The tension locks on the hinges could be a little stronger."
4,text book,"Always a good idea to purchase text books from Amazon rather than the campus book store! All the used books I have purchased on line, have always been in great condition."
5,Glucosamine very helpful for my joints - vegetarian better,"I very much appreciate the Source Naturals Vegetarian choice for glucosamine. I have taken glucosamine for years for joint support. As the research and product development has progressed, the supplement choices include ""cleaner"" options. First, research has shown that glucosamine alone is just as effective as glucosamine with chondroitin. That eliminated any need for an animal component (originally ""shark cartilage"", then bovine cartilage) except for the gelatin capsule. Now a total vegetarian formula is available in an economical size."
5,vegetarian glucosamine on the cheap!!,"My wife has been having serious problems with her knees for several years now. Her doctor informed her that her two options were taking Glucosamine or Surgery.Being a Vegetarian, she had serious reservations about using a suppliment derived from several kinds of shellfish and it was relatively expensive. Her Pharmacist (usually particularly knowledgeable and helpful individual) iformed her that there was no way to get glucosamine other than shellfish.I then did some research and found that there is indeed source that didn't harm defenseless sea creatures (derived from fermented corn), checked amazon and low and behold there it be at about half the price the non-vegetarian stuff in our local pharmacy."
1,No longer works due to DST issue,"This clock was made before the change in the Daylight Savings Time dates, so now, every Fall and Spring for a few weeks, the time is wrong. The atomic clock feature DOES NOT account for the DST change. I almost missed a flight one morning due to this issue. There is no way to update it. Do not buy."
4,Great Sheets,These are great crib sheets. They have deep corners and are easy to put on the mattress regardless of how thick the mattress pad is. I really like cotton the feel of cotton and these are very nice.
5,This is one of the best!,This CD is great from start to finish. The mixture of the old and new makes it possible for audiences of all ages to appreciate the wide range of abilty Rod has. This is one of my favorite CD's of all time!
3,European disk version not functional in USA,"This is a mixed review: 5 stars for service, 1.5 stars for product quality. See that little gray box in the lower left of the cover? Well, I now know that means the dvd is for european dvd players and won't work on us dvd players. The marvello folks were very good about communicating and follow up after I informed them the dvd would not work and I received a full refund for the purchase after I returned the package. I was surprised they had not figured this out on their own but nonetheless, I would certainly do business with them again."
4,Enlightening. More than just another Tarot Book!,I love this book! Its exciting to read about each cards character. Rachel Pollack really goes deep into each Card and it all seems to just make sense. As she unravels each card it feels as if you are right there meeting them and getting to know them. Very helpful.
5,It's a powerful tarot reference no serious new age library should miss.,"Tarot users will find SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM: A BOOK OF TAROT a fine compilation of two previous volumes under one cover, joining THE MAJOR ARCANA and THE MINOR ARCANA in one revised, updated volume with a new introduction by the author. As such it's a powerful tarot reference no serious new age library should miss."
3,WISDOM???,"I HAVE READ HAINDL'S TAROT FROM THIS WRITTER AND HER DEGREE OF INTERESTING AND WISDOM (??)DECREASED TO BORING...IT IS ONE MORE BOOK DESCRIBING TAROT WITH THE SAME GOOD INFORMATION ANY TAROT BOOK CONTAINS, NOTHING i COULD CALL WISDOM, I EXPECTED MUCH, MUCH MORE FROM HER...IT IS EVEN BORING, NO COLOR, NO ATRACTIVE SETTING, JUST PLAIN DOCUMENT WRITING...AND WISDOM,,,WELL MY CONCEPT OF WISDOM WAS NOT FULLFILLED WITH HER BOOK,,,,I INSIST, HER HAINDL'S MANUALS ARE OUTSTANDING, SO MY EXPECTATIONS WERE HIGH AND I READ THE WHOLE BOOK EXPECTING THAT WISDOM (WHICH IS NOT SYNONIMUS OF INFORMATION) IT NEVER CAME...I DID NOT LIKE IT!!!"
4,A Great Resource,"As a Tarot beginner, I found this book to be both insightful and a little wordy. First of all, I must say that all in all, this book is an incredible resource! If you can get past the Psych-101 lectures, you will find incredibly astute and deep meaning in 78 Degrees of Wisdom. Rachel Pollack did a great service in combining these two volumes, and made Tarot accessible and easy to personalize. I would recommend this book (and have) to anyone looking for 'real' help in understanding the fascinating world of Tarot."
4,This book is OK...,"...but I do not find it to be the best or most informative book out there. No complaints - I only believe there are better books. My FAVORITE Tarot books are these: The Crowley Tarot, by Akron-Hajo Banzhaf; The Complete Book of Tarot Reversals, by Mary K Greer: and The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tarot, by Arlene Tognetti and Lisa Leonard. These books are full of information and would provide a nearly complete instruction for any novice out there - and I refer to them often even now as an experienced practitioner. I advocate being a student of Mythology as it pertains to the Tarot, along with Numerology, Astrology, and the Qabalah for a well rounded Tarot experience."
2,Finally mastered some bravery to side with bad reviews:),"Unfortunately, I have to side with bad reviews which are surprisingly very few. I wasn't impressed by this book at all. She gives detailed descriptions of what you see on the card, like ""there is water flowing under his thrown"" but is very vague at explaining HOW to interpret it in a reading. Lots of references to different cultures/religions/eras makes it hard to get through. If you want to read this book to get a different prospective on Tarot it might be informational but it's not very handy when you just want a quick reference on a card meaning."
5,THE classic textbook on tarot,"Rachel Pollacks ""78 degrees of wisdom"" is simply a must! It is THE classic textbook, a plain and simple fusion of the psychological approach and more esoteric cabbalistic thoughts. It doesn't only give you plausible meanings of the cards, more importantly, it shows you how to work the tarot, how to twist a story out of the cards.And it prepares you for the heavier textbooks like Paul Foster Case, The Tarot: A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages, Aleister Crowley, ""Book of Thoth"" (difficult but coupled with DuQuettes ""Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot"" it grows to one of the most important books on the subject ever) and Robert Wang, ""The Qabalistic Tarot"". All necessary in the long run."
4,Seventy Eight Degrees of Wisdom; a Book of Tarot,I find this to be very helpful in providing another perspective into the world of Tarot. I appreciate Ms Pollack's insightful ideas and find her opinions well thoughtout. Highly recommmend it for those just starting out as well as someone looking for another level of meaning.
4,Great book,I mistakenly ordered this book thinking it spoke about the Haindel deck. But it is an interesting and enlightening discussion of the Tarot generally and the Waite deck specifically.
2,Glorified western comic,Hart did live in the wilds of Idaho but life wasn't near as rugged as depicted in this book. He had many modern neighbors and visitors.
5,funny and touching,"A National Book Award finalist, this book is now all too little-known. It's a great story and Jon Agee's illustrations of loving woodchuck newlyweds and loud messy toddler convey humor and tenderness. A winner for kids eight to ten.carolweston.com"
4,Unbelievable price for collectabe liquid blue bears!,I'vd been buying these collectable bears for years now for my wife and usually have to spend between $15-$25 depending on if the particular bear is a limited edition or not. Can't beat these prices and quick service!
2,Not an 'hour' glass,"Mine takes a little over 4 minutes for the sand to run through. It's pretty, but not particularly useful. I too made a bad assumption from the description that since the time was not specified, a generic Hourglass should take one hour for the sand to pass through.Not practical as an egg timer since the crystal seems too fragile for regular kitchen use.I've been keeping it on a magazine on my desk, and roll it around when I'm bored. I find it relaxing, but there are probably better applications for $26.If you collect, or really like hourglasses, though, I could see why someone might buy one of these, just don't expect to get any real 'use' out of it.I had intended to use it to quietly remind me to get up from my computer occasionally. Oops, out of time..."
1,MISLEADING,"What I thought I was ordering was a textbook, and what I got was a STUDY GUIDE for the actual textbook I STILL NEED TO ORDER. (There was absolutely no mention of this being a study guide in the description). There was no image associated with the item, and now I know why. It is not worth my time or effort to send this book back, but I just wasted my money. I do not trust this vendor enough to order from them again."
5,Great Compilation Of Al Stewart's First Three Albums - 1966 Through 1970,"Many Al Stewart fans are under the mistaken impression that Al's first album was his 1973 release, Past, Present & Future.In fact Al released several albums in the late 1960s. This 2 CD compilation contains three of Al's best 1960s albums. It's excellent material with all the great guitar work and insightful lyrics that long time fans have come to expect from Al Stewart.You may not be familiar with this material but it's well worth your attention."
5,rare reminders of past glories,"What can one say! A wonderfull history from the very early days. A few very rare tracks here; no collection of Al Stewart can be considered even half way complete without this cd. Superb programme notes and rare photo images from early sixties.The notes by the way are by Neville Judd and I like all serious fans are waiting eagerly for his book on Al due to be released in 2001.The cd really brings home Als early years ,crude they may seem now but wonderfull all the same.All of Als early life love and otherwise it is all here. If you dont own it, buy it."
5,"Great music, but beware of CD rot","I have enjoyed Al Stewart's music since his first album, and saw him perform most of these songs live in my younger years. These were among the albums we played at 4am in my student days, along with ""Songs of Leonard Cohen"" and others, while we talked the world to rights.So it's great to have Al's first three albums (including ""Love Chronicles"" which was infamous at the time for one of the earliest appearances on record of the F-word, used entirely appropriately) all together on a double CD. It's also good to have all the songs from both versions of ""Bedsitter Images"", which at some point was reisssued with a few tracks changed.BUT... I have now owned two copies of this set, purchased a couple of years apart, with different cover art, and both have suffered from CD rot. I don't know the quality of current pressings, but I am reluctant to spend my money a third time to check this out."
1,hmmmmmmm,how the above person wrote a review on this site of a game that hasnt even gone gold yet....or you claim to be able to ship the game within two to three days is astonishing..and probably illegal.i'd suggest that you check out the facts and then probably remeove the review...
4,this game rocks,"MY COUSIN GOT THIS GAME AND IT IS THE BOMB,THE GRAPHICS ARE INCREDIBLE AND THE GAMPLAY IS AWSOME."
4,One of the best there is,"This is a good machine, however, during DVD playback, it tends to slow down but everything else, it's worth it."
3,WAIT!!,"Let me just say first that this is a great laptop. It has a huge hard drive (slow, but huge), 2 gigs of ram, an awesome video card...all in an attractive, functional package. BUT there currently aren't Vistas compatible video drivers available for it. So if you plan to buy this for the 'ultimate gaming machine' label, then you will be sorely disappointed. I've had my laptop for about a month and haven't been able to play much more than solitaire [...]. Hopefully vistas drivers will be released soon and this problem will go away, but for now this laptop is a very expensive movie player/ word processor."
2,Book for absolute beginners,"This book covers a wide range of topics related to IN (both US and International standards), but does not provide detail whatsoever. It is a good starting point if you want to get familiar with the general concept and determine the relevant ITU and Bellcore specs. For people who has general knowledge of IN and would like to get more detail, this books falls very short. Very disappointed."
3,not very good for children,"This book crams too many bizarre things onto its pages. Also I didn't think the author used the best choices for some of the letters. I was very disappointed when I saw this book since it had gotten good reviews. I advise getting ""America is.."" (Borden/Schuett) instead."
5,Fantastic Florida Ska Band,"This band knows what they are doing and their first album proves it. I first heard Magadog on the Skarmageddon compilation and decided to give them a try for a full album. I'm sure glad I did because from the first song (Monkey in the Whitehouse) all the way through, this album is catchy and delightfuly skankorific!! I definitely suggest it to anyone who likes ska and needs a new band to listen to."
5,Whimsical Autobiography,"For lovers of Nick Bantock (Griffin & Sabine,), and Karen Elizabeth Gordon, (Deluxe Trasitive Vampire, and Paris Out of Hand,) this small volume is a time capsule of a young girl's year growing up in Paris. Told via her stamp collection, (1 colorful French stamp and one life-vignette per page,) it traces her year with her family and school friends until the end, when they must leave Paris to come back to the United States.Inspires anyone interested in collage, (although there are no collages in the book per se, I loved it anyway,) Parisian life, and stamp collecting.The only thing I wanted was more. Where is the author now? How did her stamp collection become this book? Why is this book out of print?? Alas."
1,A bad anime,"I am a huge anime fan and a huge Kurosawa fan. So I was very excited for this anime and it let me down in every aspect. It had poor animation, bad character development and it slaughters a very good story. Stay away save your money and try not to cry at night."
3,Too much...Too little...,"Having heard much great things about this anime, I was disappointed to find it did not live up to it's reputation. It is only the first volume so I'm sure the story may improve over the course of the next few volumes, but as of the first volume I am left unimpressed. Sure the animation is nice, but animation quality alone can't make up for flat boring characters. The first volume had a pervasive sense of making up for lack of substance with stylish character designs and silly fight scenes. Too much time spent on making the show 'cool' instead of making the story interesting to follow left me cold and uninterested."
4,"The Wild West, Kid style!","Typical Western style movie, UNtypically played by kids! All the actors are youngsters. And GREAT! Family fare. Invite all the neighborhood kids in to watch. Girls, boys, everybody. Popcorn, chips, make it a Western party. They'll love it, and so will you. It's all good. You got kids? You NEED this one! Go for it! Seriously folks, this a well made Western. The child actors are all up to it. Well costumed with horses and the whole nine yards. You won't regret this purchase, ever."
3,"Great Quality, Decent design.",These are constructed great. They made of solid materials and won't wear out. I bought these for bicycle maintenance and their great but anything above the 5mm is huge. They are just big hex tools. I could have gotten a lot better set for what I'm using them for. Its a great tool though. Just a little to big. Should have researched better.
3,Tools some more,This item description not as advertised. Only 1/2 of the product are Ball End. Do not meet expectations. Packaged nicely and fast shipping from Amazon.
5,Mighty Wrench !!,"This is a mighty wrench indeed ! I can wrench Himalayas with it Boys!! This is a shop tool and cannot be carried here and there. The feel, finish and the ease of use of this tool is great. Hope I will never need another set of similar tools in my life time!"
5,Out of 300 cd's this is my favorite!,"This record should get 10 stars! I had the good fortune of hearing this as T.M. mixed it in Nashville,TN. My personal favorite tracks are Turn me on, Supernatural,The gift,and Body bag. If you like raw high energy music this is for you! This music grooves extremely hard!"
3,not bad,"Fairly good album. I expected more bass solo. I have seen what T.M.is capable of, and although this is good, it is not exactly what I was hoping for."
4,Trinity fans will love this one....,"For anyone who likes the Trinity western comedies, this is right in line with those, although set in a more modern setting. The chemistry between Terence and Bud is just perfect."
2,boring and misrepresented. Nothing about Chagall,"I bought this to use in a lesson with teens about Chagall - I thought it would actually be about Chagall. Instead it was about this person's experience in France, and had nothing to do with Chagall. Misrepresented and boring, to boot."
4,A must buy if you can find,"SO I looked for this game all over Atlanta for the whole of December and eventually found it at the EB right near my house, it is difficult to get hold of though. BUT if you find it and like college basketball then buy it. Your team will be there!!! The legacy mode is awesome, and you can play season after season without getting another coaching job, it took me five seasons at Mercer and a 130 - 30 record to get the IU job. One criticism is that recruiting is too hard, players will say they are going to play with your team and ten sign for Duke or someone else like that. For sheer sports management simulation this is the best game in the basketball genre!! Although as management sims go not in the same league as CHamp Manager, or even High heat baseball.I haven't played many basketball games to compare with but NCAA 2k3 looks to hold up with most of the best ones although the graphics are a little generic as they are not allowed ot use real likenesses"
3,cool !,"Well after waiting close to 3 months this CD is now in my CD player!if you are a true fan of the Pogues and Joe Strummer as I am ! Then buy this CD !, This CD is a true collector , And the cover of the first song is pretty goodEnjoy !"
3,Two of Three,"The Phantom Light and The Upturned Glass are most enjoyable, especially the latter. I could not endure to the end of the Red Ensign."
5,ABA Dictionary of Chinese Proverbs (ABC Chinese Dictionary Series,Having lived in foreign countries it can be very amusing or even awkward to understand the meaning of proverbs in other languages. I am so glad there are people still out there doing this kind of detailed research and allowing people like me to benefit from the expertise and dedication it requires. It is a labor of love and I loved the book. You can't understand someone else if you don't start to learn how they think. It is not a book you may read from cover to cover but it is an interesting slant on understanding another culture and how I can compare it to mine. i highly recommend this even if you don't read it from cover to cover.
4,Reasonable value per memorable proverb,"The introductory chapter explains the proverbs' use as a store of conventional wisdom in a low-literacy culture. So, it's surprising that not all of the proverbs seem inherently memorable. But the book has a sufficiently high proportion of interesting proverbs to make it a worthwhile browser for the non specialist. The (simplified) hanzi character printing is readable, but some of the horizontal strokes have been reproduced very faintly (or have disappeared completely in a few cases of small strokes). I subtracted a half-star for that indistinct print quality, and another half star for the over-explained figurative editorial on the straightforward proverbs."
5,excelllent buy,great watch case for anyone with a collection or starting one. Large watches will fit under lid no problem. cushions just the right size. great buy for the price all day.
5,Good price good quality,"Worth every Penny. I needed an organizational box for my watches and this is perfect. Very classy looking display for a dresser or cabinet. Leave it open or closed.For security purposes, it's not what its desgined for. If you were worred about someone stealing your watches they could just pick up the entire thing, only weighs a few lbs. hahaotherwise it's impressive"
2,Not as great as it looks,"Purchased this item as a gift for Father's day. When it arrived, the glass was scratched and the workmanship was poor. Returned it and realized I would have to pay to ship it back to the seller. Overall, not worth the $$."
3,Sometimes crappy screenplays get produced,"The subtitle of this book should be ""sometimes crappy screenplays get produced."" There's not much about how to structure a story or about the mechanics of a screenplay here, but it's a mildly entertaining book when it dissects perfectly awful films like ""The Abyss,"" ""Falling in Love"" and ""Cutthroat Island."" The real story here is how studios and stars with big egos can sign on and spend millions producing terrible screenplays like these. The only thing I really learned from reading this book is that the worst screenplay will make to the screen if Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep want to be in the movie. And how often does that happen?"
1,This book is not what it is made out to be,"I was dissapointed with the context of this book. I could have gotten the same information about screenwriting from reading the local newspaper movie reviews. That is basically what this book comes down to. Some of the information could be used in fine tuning your screenplay, but you could get the same results by having a friends read your work and giving advice. There are better books out there."
2,Not what I expected,"I found this book pretty dull. Even when skimming or jumping around to different sections, I couldn't get into a groove. Maybe I didn't like it because I pictured it being something else.Later, I read ""How Not to Write a Screenplay: 101 Common Mistakes Most Screenwriters Make"" by Flinn and found that to be the book I was looking for."
1,TRASH! THIS IS WHAT BINS WERE MADE FOR...,"Look, let's face it, your hardly going to become the worlds greatest screenwriter by reading this. So...don't."
2,Very Good Watch But Poor Band,"Please don't buy this watch, It is having awful band.It is get broken very soon. I bought this watch some time back it is good watch with good features. But this watch having very poor technology of band which broken as you use this watch.when you try to buy new band The cost you almost same as watch.Please don't buy it."
1,Rip Off,Product Description lacking details. Shipping wieght states 6 lbs. We thought we were at least getting a tablet of the target paper and it came as a single sheet rolled up and wrinkled. Very disappointed!
5,Awesome DVD Sound & Video Quality!,"In 1997 I had the opportunity to witness a live concert of Erasure in front row! It was incredible hearing the lyrics of my favorite songs LIVE! The wait is over, after playing this DVD I was taken back to that stage once more. The 5.1 dolby digital sound is superb and the bass is strong, the performance of Andy is as usual, INCREDIBLE! Hope to see them again in another tour soon and have another live concert recorded for us to have! These DVD will keep me dancing for a long time!"
1,running red,The red color in our towels ran liberally the first time they were put on a wet counter. They were a total mess.
5,This is a beautiful film.,"I put this film in the same ranks as Bread and Chocolate,one of my favorite films. The performances in the courtroom scene were amazing.Do yourself a favor, see this film."
2,Get what you pay for,"Good feel to it, looks nice (don't think there's any real carbon fiber on it), the attachment process is a complete joke. What a piece. It comes w/ 3 flimsy plastic inserts (half inch of very flimsy thread engagement).To install you pick the one that is closest to your threaded shaft, and self-tap the thing on. I stripped the threads without even knowing i'd hit bottom, and I was trying to be careful.I will have to lathe and tap an aluminum insert to make this thing work. So, for the price you should be able to pay a machinist to fix it for you, right? I will have to. nothing worse than a loose shifter knob, and it already is and I haven't driven with it yet."
2,meh,"Installed on a 2003 Nissan Altima to replace the factory knob that cracked apart. This knob sits way higher than the factory knob, which caused the boot to ride up and separate from the console only a couple weeks after installation.I ran into the same issue as the previous reviewer as well. The threads stripped and I have been driving with a loose knob for a few years now (I never bothered to get it machined like the other reviewer). After a few years, the carbon fiber paint has started to rub and flake off, and the red plastic underneath is starting to show through."
3,Some Issues,"After you install the shift knob you will need to keep the wrench near by because the screws do not stay tight after driving for a week or two. It does it's job, but it could do it better."
4,Catchy Rock and Roll Pop,"An indie rock duo from Portland, OR active from 1999 to 2002. This is their only release. Not to be confused with the pop-punk band Paramore (Hayley Williams) active from 2003 onward.a good mind for melody here, the songwriting is the strong point. the production is budget and the musicianship can be a bit rough, but hey it's indie rock. the album listens nicely in the order presented."
4,Good fun,"This cd was pretty good, with a nice cheerful vibe. I bought it for the song Asleep All Day, which I discovered on Kazaa and loved. The rest of the CD did not let me down."
5,I like this case!,"This isn't the most solid case I've used, but it wasn't too bad. I had to cut a section of it away to allow for a CPU cooler, but it held up. The rivets on the acrylic windows gave out and they have to be glued sometimes, but make sure you don't use superglue if they do because it leaves a white chalky looking mark. Use locktite flexible waterproof stuff...very good and still cheap glue. Don't trust the handle to hold your PC when you have it completed. It will bow and that scared me, lol. I supported it with my hand when I used it. Otherwise, good price, and trick case!"
3,"Good design, but poor quality components","Ordered for a planned HTPC. First delivery came with broken 120MM fan at mount. Replacement arrived with broken CPU temperature read out (I've seen this commented on before). The 120mm fan is a little louder than I'd like, but perhaps it will throttle down when I finally get the computer fully installed (the second replacement case is on the way!). Tigerdirect was good about the returns.Good layout overall, with room for stock cpu cooling fan, but probably not for larger unit due to structural beem that runs through the middle of the case. This may also be an issue on larger, or passively cooled graphics cards. Motherboard tray slides out, which is a nice feature, but the front panel cables are not long enough to allow you to connect the cables to the motherboard unless you have it fully installed. I would buy (and have) again."
3,o.k.,not my cup of tea for a case but it's nice for a woman. I would have never bought this freaking thing brand new for $200 or even $100. Women seem to like it so if it makes them happy then I'm happy...
5,Love the product but..........,"Love the product. Hard to find. Thus I purchased 3 tins. I did NOT likegetting clipped for 3 S&H; charges. Would not have bothered me had they been shippedseparately but instead they were packaged in one box and then sent.I guess that is the American dream. I will purchase this product again as I find mosteffective for my dry hands. I wil NOT purchase this product from the vendor again,They can take that to the bank!"
2,Great Moisurizer - BUT LOADED WITH PARABENS!,"This is such a great moisturizer, but everyone now knows the dangers of parabens, and this product is full of them. Wouldn't have purchased if I had an opportunity to see the ingredients ahead of time. I am truly hopeful that this company will re-make this product without the parabens or other dangerous chemicals."
2,I wasted my money on this,"Since I already owned (and enjoyed) Bust-A-Move 2 on the Playstation, I just discovered that what I have bought is the EXACT SAME GAME with a new name and on a new console... And, to my surprise, it's buggy to boot! The analog controls [stink], and even the digital controls stick and/or move the wrong direction all too often. As much as I despise the Playstation, BUY THAT VERSION if you wish to play this otherwise very decent game! ...Since I like the game, I would have given it 3 or 4 stars, but the buggy controls and the RIPOFF status of the game ALL BUT RUINS the fun for me! UbiSoft and Taito should be ashamed, and made to refund the purchase price to those unwitting souls such as myself who were sucked in by the name change!"
4,Not worth the money,"This game isn't worth anywhere near 40.00. For 9.99, maybe, just maybe I would purchase it but anything more than that is a rip.The multiplayer capabilities (primary reason I bought it) just aren't very user friendly. The joystick controller isn't precise enough to place pieces where you want them go... which takes away from the strategic value of the game. Overall it's very dissapointing (graphics, music, fun, value)."
1,Don't waste your money,This game is not worth the $ I paid for it. The graphics seem to be worse than the original game on Super Nintendo if that's even possible. There is no endless mode and the levels aren't very creative or challenging.
4,Laura Ashley Sophia Blouson Valance,"Fast Shipping from Amazon. The Valances are fine, however I was a little disappointed in the quality of fabric used (cheap cotton/polyester blend). I would have expected a little nicer quality fabric from a designer collection!"
5,Pretty blouson valance,I love this pattern and set. It goes very well with the other pieces of the set and looks very nice on my bedroom window.
5,Beautiful Valances!,"They match the Laura Ashley Sophia 8 pc Bedding beautifully! I found that the curtains on line were way too expensive ($79 per pair), so what I did is used my current curtains (you could also purchase inexpensive white ones if you prefer). Then I brought my sham with me to a local JoAnn Fabrics and found a great calico blue & white fabric that goes great with the sham. I only bought 1 yard and only using sissors I cut the fabric to make tiebacks - they are about 4 inches wide and I already had the decorative screws to tie them back. With the excessive fabric I drapped it over a mirror. This affect picked up the coordination of the tiebacks in the room, which go beautifully with the valances that match the bedding. My room is now looking gorgeous without spending a lot of money! I'm so glad I did not buy the expensive curtains!"
3,Interesting,"I read this book mostly because I hoped for a rapid weight-loss miracle. I found the recommendations far too stringent for my working mom lifestyle and I wasn't ready to make such an extreme commitment, but there were interesting suggestions regarding food allergies in this book and using them helped me realize that dairy products seem to be an allergy for me. It's interesting reading with a degree, I've found, of validity - but I'm just not sure about the extreme stuff."
4,the waterfall review,"i found the book very informative and written in a way that i could understand, not over my head, now i am very aware of what i eat, now it makes sense, thank-you"
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"This book was useless for Americans, all the food in the recipes is unavailable in America or we call it something different. The measurements are in metric and no conversions are provided. There was too much so called medical jargon and nothing to back up their claims. In addition after trying the diet (as close as I could) I actually retained more fluid. Complete waste of money and time to read!"
1,Awful book,Knew all the basics anyway.. and then you get lost in the technical language... waste of time trying to interpret it. I gave it to the Goodwill.
2,waterfall diet,"Probably a great diet, but not what I was looking for. Didn't even recognize some of the foods on the list."
4,water retention diet book,"I am still reading this book, but am amazed by it so far. I hope to start the diet with in the next month. It makes complete sense and may be the answer I need. I would suggest it to anyone who struggles with water retention."
1,The Waterfall Diet,This book was not helpful to me in anyway. The diet is very difficult to follow and extremely restrictive. The authors also expect that you eat a number of items that might be difficult to find. This is not a diet book that I would pass on to any of my friends that are looking for ways to keep those extra pounds at bay.
2,Waterfall diet,I found it hard to understand. It is very much not aimed at American audience and would need some tweaking to be useful.
1,Lead?,"Description states ""complies with California's AB1953 Low Lead Laws"", yet the back of the package has CA Prop 65 warning, ""This product contains chemicals, including lead, ..."". Doesn't appear to be nfs61 compliant. Not intended for potable water?"
5,Read Description,"I bought this, not realizing that the size is not standard. This preventer does not fit my travel trailer, too small. Seems really well built, like it will last a long time."
3,Too Lazy to Go To The Library?,"I bought this electronic, so-called book, but I'm not sure I would buy another one. Basically, it consists of a page or two torn from the Gale guide entitled Contemporary Authors --available in virtually every library in America.I wasn't expecting a lot for $4, but I did expect that they might have had something worthwhile to say on the subject. After a list of his works in print and a tiny snippette of biographical details, the real meat of the article turns out to consist of short clippings from Edson's various book reviews over the years. It's hard to get much information from a ten word quotation, and the citations are too vague to follow up to the original source with any ease. Oh...and it hasn't been updated for almost two years.In general, I like the idea of downloading a book instead of wasting paper and postage, but I think this sort of rip-off gives the whole idea of electronic books a black eye."
4,really colorful,"Reviewed by Becca Lawler (age 9) for Reader Views (12/06)I really liked the pictures and they were really colorful. It was interesting to see his journey to save his village. I really liked the pictures at the end that showed how to Book received free of charge stick. I didn't like the way ""The Rainstick: A Fable"" ended. I wanted to know what happened to his village.Book received free of charge"
5,So glad I found this online,This product worked with my Motorola Razr and saved me a ton of money. Buy with confidence!
1,You get what you pay for.,"This charger did fit a Motorola Razr. But, it broke in less than a week. Not worth the money."
4,Excellent primer for GC,"A very good reference for those who just start to learn gas chromatography. The book was written in a format that make it easy to understand with more emphasis on the practical side rather than theoretical treatment for GC. After 40 years of intensive development, gas chromatography is still a very formidable technique."
4,helpful,"good information about all type of GC. Description and techniques instructions. It's a general book, so you'll not find deep information of a typical GC."
1,"Wrong packaging, beware","The image is the wrong dics. Whats show is the complete symphonic recordings but its actually the highligths. its one disc not the three it should be. Not sure if its just a mix up in the photoes or if its done on purpose to sell the other at a higher rate then it should. Also the quality is very poor, although it was sold as almost new, and althought it looks new the quality of the recording is very bad. It has alot of static sound and has to be played at a very loud volumn in order to hear it."
5,Superb,"I loved this film; I'm about to buy the DVD. It's enchanting. You may argue that the ending is weak but I don't know. The more I think about the ending, the more I like it."
5,Ending was Perfect,"The ending was perfect, whether you choose to call it symbolic or artistic or realistic, it concluded the movie beautifully. It would have defeated the flow of the movie if the director summed it up with some ""moral"" or ""happily/sadily ever after"" conclusion. It ended where it really ends."
3,But I did enjoy it...,"Very nicely done. Beautiful scenery. Outstanding acting (especially by the children). The storyline just left me a little ""wanting"". Didn't feel compelled to watch it again. But you may feel differently."
3,respiro,"This movie is very different from most Italian films I've seen. Taking place on an island with fantastic beauty, it was very compact in content. Adult in one way, and childish in another, the story is pretty wild. The children play a very large part around a mother with emotional problems, and a very strong fishing community. A good movie, but one you would only watch over because of the natural beauty. It demonstrates how tough survial can be when your income depends on the sea."
3,boys running semi-naked,A film of boy-gangs hanging around warm Italian sea and making fun of making each other naked running home while special young mother of two young teens struggled with reality.It is a sort of romantic family movie for rather adults.
2,Baffled,"While there are some redeeming qualities to this film, it is ultimately a disappointment. It left me wondering, ""What was the point?"" Golino's performance, as well as that of the supporting cast, is quite good. It is the story itself that underminds their work."
5,Great!,"This is a masterpiece...Good performances, beauty and feelings!The boy that plays in the film is unbelievable, to much sensitive!I've liked!"
2,Stable & fast but not there yet,"I'm one of those that want to get away from ""anything Microsoft"" and after reading about all the Linux distros bought the Xandros version.The install was very easy but it wouldn't recognize my second hard drive and I was unable to figure out how to get it to do so.In additon I found general tasks not intuitive at all and nowhere near as good as Windows: this is one thing that MS does well.Another thing I found to be annoying and unnecessary are all the windows that pop up asking cryptic questions.If Xandros is the ""easiest"" Linux distro around, I'd sure hate to tangle with the others.Xandros does run well as far as that's concerned and that's why I'm giving it 2 stars, but I can't understand why they didn't go further and refine it. They should either try to improve on how MS does it or, dare I say it - copy them.As it is, my advice is to wait until they get it right."
1,do not buy this!,"I ordered two of these and both were defective! One had stripped threads and could not be assembled without major modifications. The second had missing parts. The brass gas injector part is very short making the adjustment valve hard to move AND it bumps into the attached gas hose and/or the hose clamp. In general, a very cheap design and cheaper manufacturing-- not what I am usually used to from Coleman. I was very disappointed with this product."
4,"Good, easy to find knives",Got these for use in the RV - the colored handles make them easy to see in the drawer - no accidents! Nice product - especially at this price.
3,"OK, but don't expect too much!","I bought these knives on a special. I got what I paid for. I would have given 2 1/2 stars if that was an option. If you have more than one person cooking at the same time, it is nice to be able to grab a knife for some quick work rather than doing time share. However, these don't hold a candle to the real deal. Oh, they are colorful :)"
1,my Zwilling J.A. Henckels,"Not happy with these knives at all. I did expect more from the reviews I read, and a good name brand.My husband has had to sharpen them already, and they don't stay sharp.In the first place, they were sent in a huge box, I did call the company to say I see why it cost so much!and what a waste, what happened to ""green"" and save the planet?"
5,great knife set - terrific in the kitchen and also a very suitable gift,"This set has been a lovely addition to my kitchen. Whenever I need a paring knife, I am always so happy to find these in the drawer. They are sharp, comfortable to hold in the hand, a good assortment of different blade shapes, and also bright and cheerful with their colorful handles. I keep ordering more sets to give my friends when they have wedding showers or for a housewarming gift. For practical, everyday use, I really recommend these knives."
5,Love them!!,"3rd set I have ordered. Stay sharp and very easy to use. Had to order this set so I could find a knife for me to use. Family grabs others, so I never can find one when I need it. Hopefully, these are mine!!"
2,Not expected Henckels quality,"If you are looking for the legendary Henckels quality, spend more money on a different set. These knives work as well as what you can buy at the grocey store or target, but are not close to the sharpness as more expensive Henckels. The quality knives are forged, while these are stamped."
5,Zwilling JA Henckles knives,I love this brand. This is my third set. I have one at home and found I needed one set in the camper and this last one was a gift.
3,useful secondary knives,"As a Man - I prefer the heavy blade thick full tang handle Vanadium steel paring and deboning knives I got at Ikea for $9 each, but I saw this set at a local Bed and Bath chain for half what Amazon charges, so I grabbed it. The variety of blades can be useful with specific chores such as dealing with onions, but the thin blade and light handle makes them only good for casual use, or for kids or guests you trust to help prepare ingredients or garnishes while you cook. Don't leave these in moisture long or they will develop rust stains. Don't buy these for hard of sight or absent minded people, since at least two of the knives look and feel so similar blade up or down that it's easy to cut your knuckles before you realize the blade side is up. I would gladly award this item a 4th star if Amazon didn't charge so much for them."
5,Perfect for 'in the hand' work,"For peeling it's the part of the blade near the handle that you're actually using. With the blue, yellow and green knives the sharpened edge goes almost up to the handle, which is ideal.The blades are quite thin, which helps cutting through fruit and vegetables. E.g. the yellow one is 1.05mm (40 thou) at the top near the handle, tapering slightly to 0.90 mm (35 thou) where the curve starts. Which isn't too thin, it's about ideal.The handles are soft plastic with a nice texture that feels good in the hand.They're very sharp when they come, so you have to be careful, and they seem to hold an edge well."
5,Great inexpensive set of knives,"J.A. Henckels Twin Grip Colored Paring Knives, Set of 4When the knives arrived they were extremely sharp and six months later they are still very sharp, the knives are light and easy to handle, the blades aren't thin or flimsy and the colors are very close to what you see on screen.***Update - May 2012***The knives are still holding up great, I dont take special care of them actually I'm a bit careless with the knives. I did have to re sharpen the green and the yellow a few times since I use the green, red and yellow the most, but they keep the edge for a while befofe I have to do it again."
5,Elvis 30 # 1 Hits - Awesome CD!,Hello I'm an autistic adult.These are my favorite songs:1. Heart Break Hotel2. Don't Be Cruel3. Hound Dog6. All Shook Up8. Jail House Rock23. Return to Sender24. Your The Devil In Disguise27. Suspicious MindsBonus Track: A Little Less ConversationI love Elvis Presley's music he's an awesome singer.Try out this cd you might just like it.
5,The best of Elvis!,"My grandma bought this CD when she found out about my new passion for Elvis Presley. I loved it! It has all of my favorite Elvis songs including 'Suspicious Minds', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Heartbreak Hotel', 'Marie's the Name (His latest flame)', 'Devil in Disguise' and 'Hound Dog'. The sound is just great, and the bonus track, the remix of 'A Little Less Conversation' isn't as good as the original but still wicked cool. All the songs are good, not just the ones listed above. it's definitely the best fo Elvis."
2,The King should have deserved better...,"This one is not a DVD Audio disc as we love them. It's more like a 5.1 channel CD playable only in your DVD player. There are no menus, no photos, no lyrics and no information whatsoever. You can't even change from 5.1 to 2 channel stereo when using a DVD-A player. However, sound quality is very good (5 stars). After all the good work with the sound, why didn't they go all the way? Now you're left with a black screen."
2,CD????????????,"The 2 stars is for the CD format not the music. Forget the CD, as this is coming out on DVD Audio on December 10th? That will be 5 stars no doubt."
4,Pretty good collection,"I am no fan of Elvis, but I have enjoyed his music when I've heard it. Elv1s 30 #1 Hits is a very good cd for non-fans like myself that just wanted to have a compilation of the King's ouevre. However, I was disappointed that Viva Las Vegas & Blue Suede Shoes were not included. I don't know if they ever reached number one, but they could have been included as bonus tracks. Other than that, it's a pretty good collection."
3,"lots of unknowns on this ""hits""","Actually kind of fun to listen to Elvis' early, lesser known (to me) hits."
5,He's not dead!,Both albums are perfect!I Saw a show at The American Speedway this month.What a performer of just about every genre you can imagine I found the website after waiting an hour to buy the CD after the show.Http://www.soundclick.com/natejaeger is the site.Just listen to Playing For Keeps.
3,Elvis Rocks! ...but then he croons.,"Elvis will always be known for his rock 'n' roll. What he'll be forgotten for are his sappy ballads. About half of the songs here are hip-swingin' hits and half are sleep-inducing croons, so splitting the difference gives a 2 1/2. But then add in the ""Little Less Conversation"" remix and it jumps to a 3. After hearing this, I'm hoping for some more Elvis/techno mixes."
1,Ruinous sound quality,"The production of this compilation is so bad it was hard to listen to once, and certainly isn't on the replay list. Total waste of money."
5,My son Loves it....,We bought this for our 7 year old son and he listens to it over and over. He loves Elvis and this had all the songs he likes.
4,Good Compilation,"This is a solid compilation, and the remastering has enabled listeners to enjoy Elvis songs as they were meant to be heard.On the minus side, there were some selections that I questioned, and others that I wish were included. But all in all it is a worthy CD, and heads over anything by contemporary recording artists. The King lives!"
4,What More Is There To Say?,"He's Elvis. He's the King. He may be dead, but that certainly didn't stop his career. This is where rock and roll started, and if the post-Army stuff IS sort of...""e-yew!,"" still...if it wasn't for him, we'd all be kicking out the jams to Barry Manilow or Kenny Loggins on Saturday nights. The King is Dead, long live the King! And now I'll shut up before I start to sound sacreligious."
5,Great CD,"For lifelong fans as well as newcomers, this is the CD to get. Elvis has never sounded better. While this would be a perfect addition to your existing collection; it would also be a great way to introduce the man and his music to everyone else. I have purchased several copies to do just that."
3,"Some Good Tunes, But A LOT Sounds Really Dated!","Sure some ballads like I CANT HELP FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU,LOVE ME TENDER still sound fresh, even if mainly for a teenage listener. But do JAILHOUSE ROCK, and DONT BE CRUEL really belong among the best pop song recordings ever? I don't think so! Frankly, there is a lot of mediocrity in this over-rated songster's catalogue! Yes, he died at age 42, very sad, but that's no reason for the near de-ification this fellow has since received. Among his contemporaries who died even younger, there is one with a far better song catalogue..yes, that's right..Bobby Darin, now getting some very deserved,renewed attention! Is Elvis the #1 songster of them all? Hardly! Mr. Sinatra, and his incredible recording catalogue (over 50 years, longer than Elvis's entire life) completely blows away Elvis! Not to mention the Beatles, creators and performers of some of the best songs ever!"
1,Don't Believe The Hype!,"Just another compilation, this one clearly designed to cash in on all the media hype over the 25th anniversary of Elvis' death. Avoid, avoid, AVOID!"
2,Overatted,Elvis has always been overatted and this album displays that fact. The most pampered ego in music history had something in the 50s but became a joke from the 60s on. Also someones telling porkies here. Elvis only had 18 number ones in his career. The Beatles are far superior and more creative. I suggest you buy their ONES album which is the work of true geniuses!
1,Elivis the King of Rock? Just ask Public Enemy.,"I just want to make a statement by saying Elvis is NOT the King of Rock and Roll. He could not write songs and play instruments so competently as the Great Chuck Berry or Little Richard. He lacked the power and soul of James Brown. His singing was little less than mediocre.This CD is better than most rock albums of the times, but afterall it represents the first ever pop Muzak, the world's greatest imitator of pure R&R music."
5,Essential... even if you already own these songs,"Another Elvis Greatest Hits? Yes, but not just another. Credit must be given to the incredible job the production team have done as these well-known and well-loved tracks sound fresher than ever before. This is particularly true of Don't Be Cruel, Return To Sender and She's Not You. Elvis' voice has never sounded clearer on any disc and it's an absolute joy to hear his vocals in such clarity, even on songs which are so well known.Mention must also be made of two alternate takes (not listed as such on the CD case): A Fool Such As I features Hank Garland and not Scotty Moore on the instrumental break, while a slightly re-worded The Wonder Of You is included, from Las Vegas in February 1970, a different show than the ""original"" version.I own dozens of Elvis albums, many featuring these songs, and I did initially hesitate about buying this; having decided to add it to my collection, I'm glad I did, and so will you be."
5,Shut your mouth and open up your heart.,"Do you really need another review of this CD? Probably not, so I'll try to keep it brief. Obviously, the idea here was to make a CD with Elvis' #1 hits, in the vein of the smash hit Beatles CD with the same concept. Well, why not? If it worked for the Beatles, it should work for Elvis, too. And it did, with the CD being a worldwide smash hit. But a little known fact is, they kind of fudged things in order to get ""Burning Love"" included. See, the generally accepted ""official"" record charts are New Musical Express in the UK and Billboard in the US. ""Burning Love"" reached #7 on the New Musical Express chart and it reached #2 on the Billboard chart. But ""Burning Love"" absolutely is THE classic Elvis song of the '70s, so I can forgive them for ""cheating"" a little in order to include it. If you only buy one Elvis CD, it will probably be this one. If you buy every Elvis CD, you are as crazy as I am."
5,This sounds brand new!,"This cd sounds like it was recorded yesterday! The version of a ""Fool Such As I"" is different but actually sounds better than the original. Listen to "" Jailhouse Rock"" & see for yourself how crisp it comes across those speakers!"
5,awesome!,"to ""rich in boston"" wake up and get a life. if he does`nt, or more pertinently, WON`T acknowledge the artistry and genius of these recordings he does`nt know ZILCH about music. suffice for me to say, that, if you wish to find out where it all started from, you could do worse than purchasing this cd/record/cassette etc........"
4,"All the classics are here, but.","This album represents the cream of Elvis's career. I am disappointed though with the sound quality of this cd and there are two alternative takes (The Wonder Of You) and (A Fool Such As I) that are not as good as the originals. Still for a complete album of classics and for fans new to his music, this is a good place to start."
4,Elvis 30 #1 Hits,"The whole CD is good, then for some strange reason they tacked on a bonus song I had never heard before by Elvis that is very different than the songs on the CD. It ruins the CD...you have to run and grab it before it comes to the bonus song. Of course, music being good or bad is in the ears of the listener."
5,elvis the king,"Just one word: The King. Elvis is still the best of rock music, he is one of the best singers of all times. This collector item is a must! I wish his song ""Blue Sued Shoes"" was included as well."
4,This could of been 2cds set than one,"I just got my copy ELVIS 30 #1 HITS and the sound has improved alot and sound ""GREAT"" but they should included ELVIS'#1 hits from the country charts and the R&B; charts like ""I WANT YOU, I NEED YOU, I LOVE YOU"", ""MOODY BLUE"", ""I FORGOT TO REMEMBER TO FORGET"",""WEAR MY RING AROUND YOUR NECK"", and so on do not get me wrong i thought the cd is great i just thought that the producersshould have decided to make this a 2cd set than one."
4,elvis 30 hits,"Where is ""Always On My Mind"" on this compilation?..not too many better Elvis songs than that. I recommend a compilation released in 1996 called ""The Essential Collection- 28 Timeless Classics"". It has excellent sound as well, can't see this album being any better. ""Essentials"" was numbered, and possibly was for a limited time so I am not sure to its availability."
3,Could have been better!!,"Even though Im only 16 I love Elvis. He was so talented though I thought this album had room for improvement. The arrangement of the songs could have been better. I much prefered the second half of the album. 'In The Ghetto' , 'Crying In The Chapel' and 'A Little Less Conversation' are the high points of the album. It lacks life or something . I wish I could have given it more credit but then I wouldn't of been completely honest with you's. All I can say is ive heard better from Elvis Presley in the likes of 'Aloha in Hawaii'."
3,Some Good and Some Not Good,"While the remixing of songs on this CD improve the quality of the tunes, this CD is really not worth purchasing. Only about half of the songs are ones that you will want to listen to over and over. It is amazing how popular some of his really bad songs were. I recommend that you pass on this CD"
2,It's NOT an audio CD,"This was my first Elvis music purchase and I hate to say it but it's a disappointment. Elvis is great and I like the songs but it's advertised as an audio CD and that's what I thought I was buying - and my receipt says it an audio CD. But it is NOT an audio CD - it is an audio DVD. And being an audio DVD (with no video and no menu) it won't play in ANY of my CD players - not my home CD players and not my car CD player. So I get to listen to Elvis through my tinny TV speakers with no way to select certain songs. Also there are two songs that the audio drops on for about 30 seconds. I ONLY give it two stars because it's Elvis. Sorry Amazon, you dropped the ball on this one."
4,"Where is, I want you, I need you, I love you?","On June 2nd 1956 Billboard top 40 hits listed I want you, I need you, I love you as Number One. Where is it?This is a great collection of hits. 14 of these hits never reached number one. 10 of these never even reached number 2.Don't get me wrong. These are all great songs, but if you are going to call it #1's. You should at the very least have all of the number 1's first. Then add the others. Don't Y'all think so?"
4,KEEP HIM ALWAYS ON YOUR LIPS!!!!,"I love his music! I love the songs like heartbreak hotel or Kentucky Rain. Elvis Presley made music history and he is why we have rock today. It's evolved over the years, but he was the king.Teens,children, adults, can all enjoy his music.I actually don't like his whole Viva Las Vegas gig in his later years, but I love his music when he was just starting. The jumpsuits didn't do anything for me. This CD is perfect if you are an over all elvis fan,or if you don't really like his Jumpsuit years (like me) because a lot of his earlier hits are on this CD! Everyone should own this CD. It's his #1 hits, come on. What more can I say???"
5,"It's Elvis ""The King""",The selection of his best 30 was pretty good. Might differ slightly than my own choices but I am still extremely happy with the purchase.
5,the songs sound so fresh...,Congratulations to RCA for finally putting this CD out. The sound is more fresh and crisp than it has ever been. Elvis once again proves why he is the king! His place in our hearts and history is assured.
2,Damaged - should have sent it back,This is a used item that was listed as Excellent or something like that. But it is scratched and one song will not play and another has a skip in it. I shoud have sent it back but for $3 too much trouble. I guess they count on that at that price.
3,ok,"I'm not a huge elvis fan, but needed to have some of his music for my collection. there is about a dozen songs on here that i would listen to more than once. burning love being my favorite. so what i'm saying is this is not a bad elvis collection. the sound quality is pretty good considering how long ago these songs were recorded."
3,nice rip off,"i think (pre-military) elvis is great. elvis presely was one of the greatest pioneers of rock music, pre-military of course. this is a great cd that showcases some of his best (or most popular) music. the only thing i dislike is the way the album is presented, package-wise. perhaps the record company could have chosen a name that didn't completely rip-off the beatles 1 album?"
5,Must Have Elvis,"if you don't buy but One Elvis Presley Album this is the one to get.it has all of His Jams on Here.the SOund is Great&very detailed.My Favorite Elvis Song on here never sounded better ""Suspicious Minds"".He was a Very Important Artist that will never be forgotten&this Set will showcase Why.for new Fans this is A Great Introduction to His Music."
3,good music - but only if you use a cd player,"I loved the selection - that's why I bought this CD. Unfortunately, this CD does not play on a DVD player. So if you're used to listening to music on your pc - it won't work. I've gotten this CD twice and no luck either time."
5,This is a no-brainer. Buy it.,"I grew up listening to my dad's 8-tracks during the 70's and know all the songs by heart (like the little girl in Lilo&Stitch). I HAD to have this CD. Hearing it again, it's obvious why Elvis was so successful. You like rock? Elvis did it. You like to dance? Elvis did it. You like love songs? Elvis did it. Like it says inside the CD, ""Before anyone did anything, *Elvis* did everything."""
5,Only Missing One #1,"Great CD. Highly recommended. However, if this is supposed to be a collection of all Elvis #1 songs there is one song missing. In 1956, ""I Want You, I Need You, I Love You"" hit #1 in the USA. Unfortunately, it is missing from this CD."
5,The King is given the royal treatment!,"ELV1S 30 #1 Hits is destined to become a top album by the end of this year or next year. This is so much better than The Beatles 1. Elvis is the King and the King is given royal treatment with this smart release. It spent the first three weeks at #1 (hooray!), and 5 weeks in the top 10. Now it's at #11. If you haven't bought this album yet, you don't know what you're missing! This is definitive and deserves top feeding. All of the songs are crisp and crystal-clear sharp. This CD needs to be rated 10 stars. I hope it goes diamond around the world soon, and goes diamond here in the U.S. within a while. ELV1S 30 #1 Hits: ""Before anynone did anything, Elvis did everything."""
4,"VOCALLY HIS BEST, BUT....","This is Elvis best single disc of hit songs ever released. Vocally I've never heard him better. All 30 songs sound like he is singing in the living room. On a few numbers some instruments are heard for the first time. However, there is a trade off. The remastered versions take on an alternate take effect with the background music sounding like it's coming from down the hallway. The midrange is MIA. Another thing the trademark ""Presley Echo"" from the 50's on the first part of the CD is almost non-existent. The bonus track ""A Little Less Conversation"" is great, if your eating in a bar & grill and talking on the cell phone. In closing, I'm going to keep my copy for auto driving where the high notes are most appreciated. For serious music listening, I'll stick with the old albums."
5,THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER!,"This CD is the best ever! Elvis has done it again! My favorite song on the album is ""Marie's The Name (His Latest Flame)"" I hope I get the next one!"
3,elvis 30 #1 hits,"I justdo not think that this cd was properly remastered. Unlike elvis 2nd to none,which sounded great, the sound quality is lacking on this cd."
3,Top 30 Elvis Songs,"This is the first Elvis CD that I had ever listened to. My Dad has a copy of this CD and it's really how I got hocked on Elvis. My entire family likes Elvis really. Even my younger sister just recently got interested in him this past year.The reason for three stars, is because I have found much better, and brooder Elvis CD collections.I very highly recommend From Nashville To Memphis: The Essential 60's Masters [BOX SET] and Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential 70's Masters [BOX SET]. The sets are pricey at best. However, you get a lot more hours to listen to Elvis. The on a one CD set."
4,At Last: Elvis That I Enjoy,"I will start by saying that I was never a huge Elvis fan. He some songs that I like very much. Expecting some poor sounding, tinny tunes, I was greatly and pleasantly surprised at the sound quality. The remastering has worked wonders on these old favorites. I originally planned to listen to just my favorites (Are You Lonesome Tonight, Can't Help Falling In Love With You, It's Now Or Never) but I found myself listening to the whole disc and tapping my feet most all the time. Though there are bigger fans of Elvis than myself, I'm thrilled to own this collection!"
2,I wish it were better,"I love all of these songs, and I was really hoping this would be my ""one stop"" Elvis CD, but I must say this CD was mastered poorly. It sounds tinny and hollow to me. It seems they put ""the King"" front and center, and left the band behind. His voice is clear and loud, but the music is way in the background, and in some places you can barely hear the band. I'm no re-master expert, but I can tell when something sounds out of proportion. Pass on this one. I would not recommend."
5,very highly recommended,a masterpiece of a compilation from the great elvis featuring all his big hits.highly recommended.
1,"Good singer, thats it.","Elvis wasn't creative, he simply had a pretty face and a good voice to sing other artists creations and take too much credit. I don't like his music."
1,Get Over It.,"wow. so he has a fancy for executing amateur karate chops and other pitiable antics whilst displaying his deteriortaing health with that god-awful one-piece jumpsuit. WOW!extra extra: get over elvis.the whole rock and roll life style is a joke, its degenerate and banal."
1,King of Trash,I can't believe how people is so stupid and eager to call this music.Elvis is one of the worst singers i've ever heard.He can't sing for rat's s***.His music is even worse.Elvis is a joke artist
1,Elvis was a racist,"It's sad that most Elvis fans dont know that Elvis was a racist. Ask public enemy, I dont like his music."
5,ELVIS LIVES !!!!,Great collection of The Kings hits from the 50's into 2002.Finally all his best on one cd. 79 minutes. This will get you rocking.
4,Good book,"Really good book to have if you are in the real estate business. However, not all the words or phrases are in this book so you should follow it up by having a plain English/Spanish dictionary."
1,A Pup named Scooby Doo Vol. 3.,"Although I ordered Vol. 3 the DVD contained in the box was Vol. 4. That DVDrated a 4 star review, but even after a replacement DVD was sent the sameproblem occurred. The 1 star reflects quality control in packaging andshipping."
3,mastered from vinyl,"This collection is a great idea, pulling together lots of studio material without repeating any songs from ""Raw Power"" in alternate versions. A problem: it's all mastered from vinyl, and the sound quality isn't the best. (I haven't heard all the BOMP! CDs, so I can't say how they sound in comparison.)This is worth buying for the incomparable ""I Got A Right""/""Gimme Some Skin"" (otherwise available only as a heavily-padded CD) and the studio songs from the ""I'm Sick of You"" EP (which are nice to have, but may not be worth buying on a full-price disc all their own).So buy this CD for that stuff, and then, if you like ""Kill City,"" maybe pick up BOMP!'s remastered version of that album - and you'll be ahead of the game."
3,great set but missing a classic!,"why put this disc out without their biggest song ""talk dirty to me?""bummed me out..."
2,Not happy,"Just like a recent reviewer, I am not happy about this book. It is far too wordy for its own good. And I find it very annoying that all examples use UK Imperial measures. Often the metric equivalent is provided as well, but typically not for the constants. The author does not even know the metric system. He claims that the unit of measure is centimetre and not metre."
4,Dogs love this stuff!,"Great training ideas, Mandy's book is recommended reading for my classes. Not only do the dogs love this, the people love ""playing"" with their dogs.Check this book out if you really want to train a happy, reliable, thinking dog!"
2,Not for experienced trainers,"I made the mistake of thinking this book would contain some advanced training techniques. Boy was I wrong...I was very disappointed. It would be a good book for beginners just getting into training more than basic obedience. But for experienced dog trainers, its a snooze, and some of the techniques I actually disagree with. Not to mention the fact that their whole system depends upon a dog who is highly food motivated. Consider carefully before purchasing."
5,My husband loved this book,"I had to write this review as I saw this was being totaly badmouthed by other wives. The book is honest, to the point and easy to understand. My husband does not want to hear all the medical terms but he wanted to know what was normal for him and I to be going through. I agreed with most of his comments and advise.As far as the negative comment from other reviewers about the dad going home to rest, it is just a suggestion, and not always a bad one. These books open the dialog for the mom and dad to discuss how they want to handel it. I did not feel like the author was insensitive at all. This really helped my husband and it was a quick painless read for him and made him more involved in the process."
3,little disappointed,"Just put this birdfeeder up and it is already rusting in some places. Also, it is hard to get the seeds in unless you take it down and set it on the ground. Can't use sunflower seeds they are to big to get into the feed bins. I'll have to put little seeds in it and so far I haven't seen a bird at it. Would not buy another."
3,"""She Controls Me"" makes it worthwhile","Nothing real unique about Strange Advance, there were many similar sounding bands in the 1980s. However, the song ""She Controls Me"" does rate as one of the best songs of that period and pretty much makes buying this collection worthwhile. Or I suppose you could download ""She Controls Me"" off of a file-sharing program. A legal one of course!"
3,A Fitting Conclusion,"I enjoyed reading the conclusion to this series, this is book four in the McAllister Files. I reccomend reading the first book in the series: Secrets, Lies, and Alibis. If end up liking the first, I think you will like all of them. This series was not the best nor was it bad. Since reading the first book I have read several more exciting series and individual books but I decided to stick with the series. If I started this series about a year or two later I may have stopped with the first book. If you are looking for a easy to read detective series with simple plots then this is a series for you.I did not receive this book for review, nor was I asked to review this book. This review was of my own undertaking."
5,She Who Watches,My wife and I enjoyed the book immensly. Patricia Rushford is without a doubt one of the finest Chtistian mystery writters we have ever read.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this for my daughters Christmas present. I wish I could take it back, but I don't have the box. Like everyone else has said it won't stay together for nothing. The piano is useless because it won't stay together. All it is doing now is taking up space in my daughters room. She can't stand playing with it because it frustrates her. Luckily I bought it on sale, but even then it wasn't cheap. Any one who has bought this item was robbed. So if you are thinking of purchasing it I'd think again."
1,JUNK,"THIS IS JUNK! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. IT WON'T STAY TOGETHER. MY LITTLE GIRL WAS NOT INTRESTED. EVERY TIME SHE TRIED TO PLAY WITH IT, THE THING FELL A PART."
3,"Beautiful, not very practical","It is lovely to have as a decorating object for a girls room, but to play with it is very unpractical"
1,Wish I had read reviews first,"This is one of the worst toys I have ever purchased for my daughter. She got this for Christmas, and if the box was not already broken up, I would have shoved the half-assembled peice of junk back in the box and returned it December 26. When I say half assembled, I mean that it had been previously assembled about 6 times and fell apart everytime my daughter so much as breathed on it. I agree with the previous reviewers that the box and pictures were very misleading. The idea and concept was adorable, but the construction was illogical and shotty at best. What burned me up the most was that this was NOT cheap - I paid a lot of money for a bunch of broken peices to sit at the bottom of my toybox. Extremely disappointed!"
1,Flimsy Product,"This thing is a piece of junk... the stairs and railings fall off constantly, the little pieces that attach to the sides and top fall off as well. The legs come out of the piano and chairs too. Every time my daughter played with it, we would spend the whole time putting pieces back on. She got tired of that and therefore only played with a few times."
1,What a Waste!!,"This toy stinks!!! My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday yesterday, and was SOOO excited to put it together to play. So, my friend and I spent about an hour trying to figure it out. It is a pain to put together, and falls apart if you touch it. It comes with no dolls, and I can't find them anyway to buy them. For today, my daughter has put my vintage Smurf figurines in to play - they actually fit quite well. But, I have a feeling this toy will be forgotten very soon. My advice - Do NOT BUY IT!!!!"
2,MORE FOR LOOKS THAN PLAY,I ALSO FOUND THIS SET FOR 40.00 TO BE HORRIBLE.. IT CONSTANTLY FALLS APART.. THE STAIRS DONT ATTACH TO HOUSE SO THEY CONSTANTLY FALL OVER. THE FLOWERS ON THE WINDOWS DO NOT SNAP IN AND STAY IN. THE PIANO LEGS FALL OFF ALL THE TIME. IT DOESNT WORK WELL AT ALL ON CARPET. THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS NOTHING FITS IN THIS...WAIST OF SPACE THE UPSTAIRS IS SO SMALL.. NO DOLLS OR HORSES CAN FIT AND THE DOWNSTAIRS ONLY FITS 2 DOLLS ON THE DANCE FLOOR.. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM AT ALL...
2,"Horrible Quality, Misleading Picture on Box","This toy was a huge disapointment. My father bought it for my daughter, who loves Strawberry Shortcake. We took it out of the box and set it up, but it kept falling apart. It comes in tons of tiny little pieces that you have to snap together, but the pieces fall apart at the slightest amount of pressure. My daughter ended up screaming with frustration. And it didn't come with all of the furniture shown on the box. Only the fireplace, armoire, and piano. We ended up superglueing the pieces together, and it now works enough to play with it, but for $40 I shouldn't have to doctor a toy to get it to work!"
2,Not berry much fun,"I've never seen a toy that falls apart as much as this does. It's pretty and had potential to be very cute, but poor manufacturing or something ruined it. My 4 year old gets so frustrated because it constantly falls apart. I've tried and tried and tried to fix it - but it won't stay together - she touches something and it falls off. Not durable and not worth the $$$."
1,Not reliable,"I have been using 5 minute epoxy for over 20 years and Loctite is the first brand I've run into that was bad. I used it to repair a ceramic sculpture. The first attempt failed. Then I mixed some more and timed how long it took to set, which was at least 15 minutes. Then I repaired the sculpture with it. I think it will hold after a day of curing, but it bled out of the broken spot and looks really bad. I plan to empty the container and mix it up so it will harden before I throw it away. I'm very disappointed, partly because it IS a product that is made in America."
5,I love this stuff!,"I've never used epoxy before, just super glues and the like. I wanted something stronger to glue a metal motor casing to a specific plastic piece, and it worked great! I was really surprised by this stuff, it does indeed set in 5 minutes, and gets even stronger over maybe 30 minutes. The package says wait overnight i think, but i think it's plenty strong after 30 minutes. The tubes don't really get clogged either if you wipe of the residual glue (i don't use the nozzles). The only thing I don't like is the smell...WOW! I mean it won't fill your house or anything, but within 6 feet of it, even after it's dried it still does IMO, it really stinks, and before it sets it's bad enough it makes me a little queasy. Other than that great stuff! Oh yes, if you can, try to roughen the surfaces of the things you are gluing together. It'll still be pretty strong if you don't, but it really makes a difference when you do."
4,Worked fine,"I bought this to repair the (plastic) arm of an office chair, so it was just a temporary repair while I shopped for a new chair, but it bonded well and held fast. Don't take the ""5 minute"" set time too literally, especially with hard-to-bond materials like plastics...took considerably longer to bond on whatever plastic the chair arm was made of."
4,Dries clear but did not withstand my abuse.,I broke my hearing aid ear piece twice. The cost of replacing the molded ear piece is expensive. I tried the epoxy; looked great; could not withstand the stress of my ear flexing and rotating.
1,Lousy product,"So this thing contains two substances that you are supposed to dispense and mix together. When I got mine, one side was dried solid and the other was leaking all over the place. I never got to use it to glue anything because one side didn't dispense.I had the joy of the other side leaking all over my hands and arm...then I looked at the packaging. It contains carcinogens and isn't supposed to touch your skin...lovely."
4,Good value for the money,"I wanted a digital cable to connect my dvd player (inexpensive, but decent) to my receiver. Although I could have used an optical digital cable, since my receiver has 2 optical inputs and the dvd player comes with both optical and coax audio outs, I decided to get the coax, since it is sturdier than the optical cables. The sound seems crisp and clear to me, and I have had no problems with any interference with the TV picture, which one reviewer insists must happen any time anyone uses this cable to hook up their dvd player--I'm sorry he has had problems with his set up, but I have had none, and, contrary to his assertion in his review that no one who reviews this cable positively could ever have used it, I have used no other cable with my dvd player and have encountered no problems. (Did he possibly try to use it to connect his DVD player to the video-in of his TV?)"
4,Great Sturdy Durable--wont' come off,"I live in Mexico City and as a precaution use this wallet on my ankle to carry $20 or more hidden. It works great for that purpose. Credit Cards and drivers license would also fit. A passport will not. I wouldn't buy it if your item is larger than a driver's license. Whatever you get into the small velco pocket--it ain't coming out,nor is there danger of this wallet coming off your leg. I have thin and narrow feet--thin ankles too and the Lrg/XL works well for me. I am buying more."
4,Made in the USA!,"I love that this item is made in the USA and very happily pay more for American made goods instead of paying very little for problematic Chinese goods.My only complaint is that for my purposes (a travel wallet for pickpockety cities like Paris), the velcro is impractical. You have to take the wallet off your wrist to open it, because you need two hands to get the extremely strong velcro open. Not convenient for opening and closing easily and frequently. I wish it could have a zipper for people who are using it for travel."
1,Not as listed,This wrist wallet is much smaller then listed. The plastic bag for waterproof are two tiny little bags that would not fit a house key. Not as listed
2,NOT THAT FUNCTIONAL FOR ME,OKAY FOR A HOUSE KEY BUT TOO SMALL FOR A CAR REMOTE KEY.ALSO VERY UNCOMFORTABLE W/ A DRIVERS LICENSE OR CREDIT CARD.QUALITY IS GOOD BUT NOT FUNCTIONAL FOR WHAT I WANTED.
1,Velcro gives out,I purchased this product to wear to the water park. I wore it 3 times and the velcro came open and I lost my truck key.. I would not recommend this to anyone expecially if you are going to use it in the water...
2,Small is for Kids only,"I am a petite woman. I have very small wrists. I typically find watches too large for me. Well, this is definitely a small. The size is not recommended for adults."
2,way overpriced for a cheaply made item,"Just what the title says...by the time you pay for the item and the shipping, this wallet is easily double its worth. If it was better made, or had Velcro, or had zip pockets, I could see it, but not this. Amazon should be embarrassed. Go to WalMart."
1,"Yep, big keys don't fit...","I don't know what the second reviewer has been smoking, but I ordered one of these and sure enough my 3"" key did not fit lengthwise. My brother who is 6 feet tall and 250 pounds of bodybuilding muscle has huge wrists, so it worked for him with the key lying perpendicular to his wrist...unfortunately he doesn't run so it is of no great use to him.Overall I should have listened to Mr. Nietzsche's advice and tried one on in a shop first. I had no trouble finding similar wrist wallets in my local sporting goods chain store as well as two running shops. My hunch is that Mr. Waite is an Internet seller of these things and is just spreading his economically-motivated propaganda."
3,a little hard to squeeze credit cards in!,If you only have one credit card and a little cash - no prob.You have to jimmy the credit cards in at an angle and it's a very tight fit though!
3,Not the best wrist wallet,"I bought this to use at the beach and at the gym. I am a small person and the band is so tight it felt like I had a girdle on my wrist. It did securely hold my ID, credit card and key so I guess that's worth something. Very uncomfortable. I would not buy another one or recommend this to another person."
5,this man can write,"as a yankee, i didn't think i would be so fascinated by a texas history. what's sad is, we just don't have sprawling sagas like this up in new jersey."
1,Skip Kings of Texas,"Poorly written book that is written from a politically correct perspective. If you want to see Texas and Texans unfairly judged you'll like this book. The author, surprisingly, holds the J. Frank Dobie chair at the University of Texas. But Dobie obviously loved Texas. Graham obviously doesn't. For folks who have read other books on south Texas and the King Ranch, Graham adds nothing new and much to be forgotten. In addition to wading through the politically correct platitudes, the writing is simply poor - it reads more like a sophomore research paper than a professional history. Phrases like ""Such was the attitude of _______"" are so overused I finally had to quit reading this thing.No thanks."
2,Kings of Texas,"It's probably not the books fault, but when I ordered it I thought I was getting a book totally about the King Ranch founders of yesteryear & all the history regarding the family up until todays time. I did not expect a bunch of history about people I was not interested in, actually there was more in the book about other people then there was about the King family.I was disappointed in the book & regret buying it, but in truth it's my fault & not the books fault, but I would just say to anyone who is interested in just the history of the King Family do not buy this book."
5,Sophisticated and revealing and VERY well written,"Don Graham is a sharp thinker and a sort of curmudgeon for all seasons. He is therefore the ideal writer to tell the story of Texas's very own mini-Soviet empire, the Kleberg/King ranch.Graham doesn't retreat from criticism, but tells the story of the growth and prosperity of the ranch in a balanced, if ever-provocative and angled, manner.This is fine writing from one of the best historians of the Southwest. Highly recommended for all readers of sophisticated nonfiction."
2,Postcard from the edge,"Mr. Graham sub-titles his book 'the 150 year saga of a ranching empire' but his enthusiasm for the saga seems to have died with Captain King. The author devotes nine pages to Bob Kleberg's forty-odd year reign as the King Ranch dictator and scarcely mentions several other prominent and important figures in the ranch's history. Like Gone With the Wind without mentioning the Civil War. The author's research and writing on Capt. King's early years and the history of South Texas is very well done. Similarly, the treatment of the Chapman/King Ranch dispute is quite entertaining. Other than the current status of the Chapman lawsuit, the discussion of King Ranch in the present is nothing more than a brief postcard from the author's obviously quick and unfruitful trip to the edge of the King Ranch property line. If Mr. Graham had entitled the book 'Chapman v. King Ranch - a War With 125 Years Between Battles' I may have not been so disappointed."
1,Kings of Texas,"The worst book on King Ranch I've ever read. Not very interesting, does not hold your attention. If you aren't paying close attention, you'll read right over when Capt. King dies. One sentence. It just slips up on you. You can tell this guy is a liberal academe with an agenda. You get to read more anti-King & Kleberg bull than is necessary. This book is more about anti-capitalism & racism then anything. Anti-white as usual. Of course there wasn't any Mexican racism this guy saw to much. I don't believe he was fair on both sides. He doesn't really grasp the history of that area & what one had to go thru to establish oneself. Also, his dislike of the Texas Rangers was throughout the book. This is typical revisionist history & not recommended to getting a balanced view of this magnificent family & history of that area."
5,You must own this CD,I have been a fan of this band for a while now. This really is an awesome bunch of songs by a great band. I recommend it highly to anyone who is a fan of rocking good music.
4,Nice Knives,"The knives themselves are great. The box is cheap (don't expect it to look like the picture) and says made in china on it, obviously not made for these knives specifically."
5,Great value,"I was looking to get a quality set of steak knives at a reasonable price. These knives are sharp, balanced and easy to use, obviously well made. My family is delighted with them.The wood presentation box is a nice touch.All in all, a very good value."
5,Good value,"I like nice things and am a bit of a snob. That being said, these knives are not ""top of the line"" Henckels. But they don't cost the same either. More importantly, they are not the cheap Henckels line. They cut well, rather than tearing. They look nice and go with stainless flatwear. The one consistent comment made by others I find interesting is how well they survive the dishwasher. These knives are not supposed to go in the dishwasher. They are to be hand washed. The instructions so state. There is no way to sharpen them because they are serrated. So a dishwasher will dull them without recourse. But no good knives are supposed to be put in a dishwasher. This is a nice set and I am pleased I bought them."
2,Wood box cheap,Ordered steak set with wooden box. Box was warped so bad it had about a 1/4 inch open on each end. I think Henckles should be a little embarrassed to display their nice knifes in this box. We sent these back. Ordered another set .The new one waswarped also.It was for a gift so we had to keep it. Years ago we ordered our own set . No problems. Ordered a set for a weddinggift.No problems. Do not buy this as a gift. The knife design has been changed.The old ones have a nice sharp tip. These have a blunt tip.We like our old knives.Be careful if you are giving this as a gift. Check the condition of the box.
2,Only for fanatics of Yes or classic British rock,"2 1/2Hardcore Yesites may come across this old Squire group, highlighting a brief '67 career and many odd snippets to go along. Syn, like many of their British buddies of the time, specialized in catchy rock, with psychedelia and blues tugging at either end, but in the end OS pushes its luck by providing a collection from a relatively obscure group that has too much obscurity, even with the few tracks which make the disc worth hearing."
5,Fabulous fun and challenging workout,"I am really enjoying this workout. The instructor is wonderful, she really makes me smile. The workout is manageable and challenging and fun. I always have a bounce to my step throughout the day when I do it. I have been breaking up the workouts into 15 minute segments and I still get out of breath and am sore the next day. I really love it."
3,"Good video, yet not totally what I was looking for","This video seems to be a good video that includes cardio along with toning. I was actually looking for a video that pinpointed Abs. I did find a good video for Abs, so will probably use both videos. I already have a good cardio routine, so the Ab video will probably get more use. It is shorter also."
3,Enjoyable beginner workout,"I purchased this and several other DVDs to use in the winter when I can't get outside for my preferred workouts. I consider myself to be in above average, but not stellar condition for a 44 y/o woman. The workout is fun. The mountain scenery is stunning. Tanja is very pleasant and explains the moves well. The toning segments touch on most major muscle groups. The problem is that the workout is too easy for me. It is a mix of very short cardio intervals, toning, & stretching. The problem is that the cardio is too interrupted for true cardio benefits. I definitely am not even approaching my target heart rate, much less for the recommended 20-30 minute minimum. I don't even break a sweat. That said. This would be a great starter workout for a young to middle aged sedentary person just starting to exercise. Many senior citizens would find the workout to difficult."
4,Good workout,"This provided a tougher workout on the stability ball than I was accustomed to. For me, anyway, it's challenging but definitely a good workout."
5,I'm sore,"I must admit I was a bit sceptical when I got this video (and a balance ball) as a gift from a friend, after complaining that I never switch up my old workout routine. But this workout blew my mind. After doing the program my body was totally sore and I felt I had been working out in a whole new way. I love using this video to mix up my regular gym work out routines and I feel my body is much firmer and toned now. Especially my butt!! Can really recommend it."
2,Woodstock 4x36 220 grit sanding belt,"I received the product in only a couple days and it was well packed and protected. When I put it on my sander it ran straight and smooth but the minute I put pressure on it I couldn't keep it centered - it kept either running left or right and I had to keep adjusting the centering screw. It runs a little better on an older model sander I have but I still need adjust it once in a while. I know I won't buy anymore ""cheaper"" sanding belts."
4,"Great, not prefect","These are very good sanding belts for the hobbyist. The grits are smooth and consistent and have a long life due to reasonable wear.The only issue that is below premium is the overlapping glue joint. While I have only used the 80, 120, 220 grits, they all have the same higher than normal glue joints where the belt is connected to itself. This tends to make for a bumpy sanding action while on the sander, but the back side of the belt is very smooth so the sander continues to move at a consistent rate providing good results.Use of the belts with Pine, Red Oak, Birch, Hickory and hardboard has shown that the belt provides an expected performance of not loading up resulting in longer times between belt changes."
4,A real good drum video!,This is a real good video if you have some knowlage of drum beats and reading music so if you want to learn some narley drum solos and fills this books for you.
2,less than mediocre,"this lens does not fit the Lumix DMC-FZ50, it needs 2 adapters that separate it from the camera almost 1cm, so the fisheye effect is very reduced and the picture comes out like looking through a hole, woth over 30}5 of the picture in black...do not buy, I wasted my money on this"
3,Little quirks you should know about,This lens is the best we could do for the Lumix camera. The original lens is permanently fixed on the Lumix camera so you can only add a lens like this product. Adding the lens to the existing lens means the quality of the picture is reduced. Also when you use the fisheye lens without zooming in you get a black ring around the picture. Last the built in flash on top of the camera is blocked by the addition of the fish eye lens-leaving a funny black spot on your flash picture. This is not a problem if you use the hot shoe and an external flash or you don't take a flash picture. Still considering the price (fairly cheap)of this lens we didn't expect much more. Having pointed out the faults it must be said we have had great fun taking pictures with this fish eye lens.
2,Just two wolves? C'mon!,"Look, the wolves are attractive on thisWolf Pack T-Shirt - Available in Various Sizes... I'll grant you that. But for the money, I'm buying the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt, Available in Various Sizes. An extra wolf, a full moon... and the wolves are howling. Come on folks, am I the only one who sees this as a ""no-brainer???"""
3,not for the basic chef,"I tried to make the squash pancakes with fig syrup on page 133, and i came up with a squash colored mess. basically it's an egg white pancake, and it stuck to my non stick pan.still hungry, i whipped it up again, and baked the whole recipe as a souffle in a small springform, and it was delicious.but i would not expect the average home chef to be able to make this recipe successfully....the book is beautiful and i love the idea of it, and maybe i'll try to make something else..."
3,This album was good.,"I liked this album. My favorite songs would be vete a volar and copa vacia. Some of the songs had a new style which I liked unlike some of their other albums. I only payed 1:58 plus shipping which was 2:55. I think it was worth more than that. Only one thing when I got the CD it didn't come with the front cover. Oh well, I don't really care anyway I just like the CD. I give this album 3 and a half stars."
5,Best damn cordless drill on the market!,"Stay away from those high cost 14-18 volt drills. This is theonly battery driven drill you'll ever want to own. My secord,the first drill is 14-years old, and it still runs perfect. Mysecond w/ keyless chuck, rubber hand grip, longer running batts,should last just as long. I've used the new drill to put assemblea 250ft. stockade fence, some 4,500 screws, and the drill neverfailed to drive over and over again."
3,Not his best work..,"This book is not up to Micks usual high standard and will be suitable only for diehard Ducati fans. Nonetheless I found the book informative. More pages could have been devoted to the racing history. Speaking of which, Mick does Scot Russell a diservice in the epic battle for the superbike crowns for 1993 / 1994.I bought the book and passed it on and will buy a few more for firends. But it will not be added to my library.."
5,Best bar soap,"My family has always preferred the original scent Tone soap with cocoa butter. Leaves the skin clean but not dehydrated with a nice neutral scent. Unfortunately, most stores now carry Tone in different (and much stronger) fragrances which we do not like. Nice to be able to purchase the original on-line."
2,"Original, My ""Bleep""","Why do companies up and change products that were terrific in the first place? Why mess with perfection? Back in the day (re: early eighties and possibly up to the latish nineties), this soap was yellow, had a slight-tropical-with-a-touch-of-cocoa-butter scent thing goin' on, and you felt like an island vixen after use. Now, all those aforementioned positive attributes have been canned. Soap is now a dull brown (let me tell ya- color psychology in marketing should be utilized more often), scent is now a medium floral, and my skin can still be used in lieu of crocodile in the fashion industry. I have come to the conclusion that now Tone is basically a curved bar of Dial soap in an earth tone hue. Sigh...at least I still have my memories."
2,Read with Caution,"After doing a great deal of research on standardized testing, I was extremely worried upon reading this book. While it appears to be properly written and researched, I found that what comes across as objective information was actually quite slanted. I urge anyone seeking information on standardized testing to rely on empirical journals and studies, instead of short-sighted comments and witty charts. I do not believe that this book gives an accurate description of testing in America and abroad, and should be read with this in mind."
1,Falling apart,"I like the looks of it, but, 2 months after purchasing this flatware, it was falling apart. I am trying to get hold of Sabatier to let them know about their product. Unfortunately, I bought 3 20-piece placesettings. I am very disappointed."
1,Absolutely AWFUL,"I bought this set to go with my dinnerware and because of its excellent price. Unfortunately, the set was still not worth it. I have owned them for 5 months; three of the knife handles are already broken--all broke without having any unusual type of pressure applied. The silverware does rust easily, even when properly cared for. Overall, these are a horrible product and an even worse investment. If there was any way I could return them, I would."
1,...,"first time using broke a knife handle! the handles are all mostly loose and i can tell this stuff wont last. the handles are not rivited on, just glued. Stay away!!!"
3,Not many problems,"The decorative metal on the handle tends to be a bit loose, giving these pieces a less-than-quality feel. The knives are large and very sharp. I like them best of all the pieces. The handles are top-rack dishwasher safe and so far, no problems."
4,scooby doo rocks!!!,"I have always loved the ""a pup named scooby doo"" series and I was really excited to get this dvd. The episodes are pretty good on this dvd but they are really silly. My favourite episode is the ""Curse of the Collar"" because it has Scooby's family on it. I recommend this dvd to anybody who likes Scooby Doo! I just wish this dvd has bonus features!!! Why don't they put bonus features on it???"
4,fun but could be better,"This game is a fun game but if could be better. The graphics aren't the best, they are rough around the edges. also some of the rosters are wrong, especially in some of the smaller schools like wofford. if you want a big selection of schools they you should buy this game b/c there are 300 schools. The game play is fun but it seems like the players miss half of their shots in the paint. Also it is very hard to do post plays, you can't back someone down very well. also it is nearly impossible to do a fast break, after you steal the ball it takes about 2 seconds for the player to start running and by this time the defense is set up. The career mode is fun, you can take a no-name school like Dartmouth and make their program into a national contender. also the tournament is very fun. The game play is very good in total but there are some better basketball games out there"
2,real fun i wish,"well fist of all my favorite team, the silver bullets weren't even on there. every one knows the silver bullets they won their pee wee tournment last fall their record was 7-1 with 3 ties. my son is in third grade and when he found out that his team wasn't in the game he started cryin they shoulda put them in there i bet they are better than kst or whatever team got last place in that pumbkin tournment or whatever those good for nothin players call it. I think all teams no matter what the age should be in this game. thank you thank you very much."
4,sega sports-ncaa college basketball2k3,well let me tell you...when i purchased this game i thought it would have the same engine as nba2k3...but something is missing in this game...the grafics are good but could be better..the gameplay is great.... but when it comes down to low post game or rebounding that's where the game has it's faults..playing on the freshman level..you will blow out the competion..but the next two levels u will have to work [hard]..and forget about trying to back down your player in the low post it will never work the AI will force you to hit outside jumpers which i hope you have a shooting guard that's at least 85% from beyond the arc..because if not..it's a fast break for the other team for an easy dunk!..but overall the game is good until ncaa 2k4 comes out...
4,"Good, Basic, Informative","No matter where you live in the U.S., this book has a couple of rides for you. It is nicely illustrated with rough-maps (not a lot of detail), some pics, and detailed instructions on rides. It even lists the miles between waypoints, and points of interest. Most rides are between 150-200 miles, so they're easily knocked out in a day or weekend if you're planning on stopping to smell the roses. All-in-all, a nice addition to anyone's motorcycle riding library."
4,good reference,"i have used this map on a couple of trips through the hudson valley. overall it's very good, there are some of the typical issues with areas that are in the 'corners' but i found it a great resources for getting around the area."
3,The English Gentlemen Commentary,"This book was pretty much an OK read. Due to some of the reviews, I guess my expectations was a bit higher.Some portions were pretty hilarious although more dry spots of humor. If your looking for a good time filler,this is it. Enjoy."
5,Kaleido 5 STARS,"THis is a great anime. I saw the first episode in the May issue of NEWTYPE. Sora Naegino first saw a Kaliedo Stage Performance with her parents when she was young and from then on she wanted to be a performer at the Kaleido Stage. She has many conflicts, and has many funny moments. Bishie ALERT: there is one totally hot bishie Yuri, and the other bishie who obviously likes Sora is Ken.by they way this series is directed by Junichi Sato who also did : Pretear(orginal creator) and Sailor Moon (episode and series directorand Sailor moon r(storyboard,series director) So of course this is an awesome series!!!! CHECK IT OUT!! (the op and end songs r very catchy too!! i wish there was a sountrack!!)THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!!"
5,Concrete truths about the responsibilities & privileges of being a parent!,"A wonderful, truthful book about the awesome privilege that parenting is....and concrete, tried & true wisdom that keeps one focused while involved in the challenges of parenting!"
5,Vegan Natural Kosher Choice,"Vegan. All natural. Kosher. Beautiful Thai soup. Not too spicy, medium for Thai. I add organic tofu pieces and let them soak in the delicious Thai flavors. There is usually one and sometimes two bay leaves in each pouch, so consider removing them after heating (or while eating.) The other vegan Tasty Bite Indian Entrees are also delightful such asTasty Bite Entrée, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12),Tasty Bite Entrée, Bombay Potatoes, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12), orTasty Bite Entrée, Bengal Lentils, 10 Ounce Packet (Pack of 12). This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" in Listmania. Your ""helpful"" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you."
1,Tom Yuck Soup,"I think my title says it all. This soup tastes nothing like authentic Tom Yum. It has a horrible smell and an inedible, rancid flavor. I'm thinking of draining the soup and using the vegetables in my own soup to decrease the waste. I can't believe those who left positive reviews - unless I got a bad batch. I'm not willing to try again to find out though. It's simply not worth the risk."
4,Good product,Product left no unhappy afterthoughts. Great packing for longevity and freshness. I wish more American food products were offered like this.
4,"Great Set for the money, plus Amazon is Awesome","The knife set is a great deal for the money. These knives are very sharp and very sturdy. When I received the item, the butcher block was cracked so I went online and requested a replacement set. I had the replacement set in two days AND Amazon included a shipping label (prepaid) to send the defective one back within 30 days. Amazon's customer service is OUTSTANDING which is why I continue to buy everything I can from them online."
4,Great value on steak knives,"This is as good a steak knife as you will find in this price range. They are well made, and hefty enough to feel good in the hands."
3,Decent.....,"As much as these knives are hyped up, I guess I was expecting a bit more. They feel kind of cheap in your hands and do not have the nice even weight of some other knives I have used. They cut through meats decent but nothing amazing."
5,Best steak knives,"I bought these for my mother because she's been using the same beaten up knives for 30 years. I liked these so much, I kept them for myself and bought an additional set for her! Very sharp, nice feel and weight to them."
2,got rid of them,"the serrations are much too fine, to the point that food gets stuck in them, which makes washing them by hand, as i do, very hard. if you run a sponge down the blade, it rips the sponge. certain foods did not like being cut by these,used them for a couple years, before i decided enough already. got some with your typical steak knife blades, and like those a million times better.i know it's kind of nit-picky, but i just did not like them at all."
1,"Chintzy, not worthy of Henckels brand name","We have nothing but Henckels in our kitchen, as we love to cook, and everyone who cooks knows the value of good knives.I bought these without a second thought as I am used to Henckels quality. What a surprise we got! Made somewhere in Asia at bargain basement prices, I'm sure...While these probably do cut steak as well as any cheap serrated knife would, if you are buying them because they are Henckels and you expect a certain quality - don't.We returned these promptly."
2,Not so hot...,"After only a few weeks and fewer than a half dozen washes, the knives appear to be developing rust spots and one has developed some crazy grayish dis-coloring. Thought I was getting a good deal but appear to be cheaply made!"
5,excellent product and value,"We are very pleased with the product sharpness, design weight and holder. Great value for the money."
3,analysis vs. history.,"This is a good book for readers who are already familiar with the history of the period. The author offers a more or less cogent analysis of the period while assuming that the reader is familiar with the facts, and omitting a thorough description of them. As such, it makes for a rather dry reading. This is a great book if you would like to know what Dr. Anasari thinks of the history of Iran since 1921, but not a great book if you would like to form your own opinions on the subject."
5,one of the most terrific voice I've ever heard,"Minako Yoshida is one of the greatest singerof Japan.She has also been a composer, arranger,and producer for about 30years.But in this album she dedicated herself just in singing.Laura Nyro's (from 1st album) ""Buy and Sell"" is one ofthe climax of this performing.Yoshida was inspired by Laura's music in her teenageand started her career.The last tune ""Nobody knows the troubles I've seen""is magnificent. And it has very spiritual feeling.I was amazed that it was just performed by vocal and drums.In this album you could hear breathesand feel it performed just in front of you."
3,Winter Reading under the Azlan Sun,This book is an entertaning read. Cleaver funny stories. Nice to read. Pleasant.
5,Great Pokemon Video!,"My favorite is the Blaine's gym episode. The ""Big Riddle Inn"" saved Ash and his friends from spending the night in the street. As serious as he may sound, Blaine demonstrated once and again that he is a goofball. Very funny guy sometimes.The Wartortle in the Squirtle episode made me laugh so much too, a must see."
3,Interesting Story with No Twist,"I'm a fan of Shizuko Natsuki and have collected all her long novels.Portal of the Wind is different to the others such as the Third Lady and Innocent Journey. The author could still describe the emotions of the female characters in great detail like the love between the father and daughter (Tsuneyo). However, the murder case in this story was not the major theme. It was just used to bring it out: the exchange of body parts. The reader can easily spot it half way through the book.The author did not vote for nor against this kind of operation but just left it to the readers to decide. There was no twist in the end like it was in the Third Lady that gave readers surprises."
4,And the walls came down,I pulled a thousand feet of this wire through my house during a remodel. It is in-wall rated and solid core and 350 MHz so I will get gigabyte Ethernet through it when all is said and done. All 1000 feet pulled easily from the box. I can't wait to punch down the wires to the panel (using the Trend-Net 24 port) and test out the throughput.
3,A good board but not too durable.,"After only a month or two using this board we began to notice the wood was splitting. It does not soak in water so this was not expected. Then after another couple of months one of the rubber feet that is stapled to the bottom came off.It still functions well, but obviously the quality is not optimal."
4,Great Cutting Board,This is a great cutting board. It's solid and heavy wood. If only it had an indenture along the sides to catch the juices it would be excellent.
1,Buy some other cutting board,"We've been satified users of Henckels knives for years so, when we were in the market for a cutting board, we bought this board based on Henckels brand reputation. It looked good when it arrived -- it's a good size at a great price -- just what we wanted. After a few months of light use, one end of the board started delaminating. (We know how to give cutting boards proper care: the last cutting board I bought was when I was in college and lasted over 20 years.) Henckels does itself and its customers a disservice by selling such a shoddy product, and it doesn't warranty any wood products. (Another board we bought from Target at about the same time is still looking good.) So, my advice would be look elsewhere for a better quality cutting board."
1,Germ magnet,You would think a knife company would be able to pick or produce a good cutting board. The wood on this board splits and cracks easily and this allows for germ development.
2,I cannot recommend this board,After using this cutting board for a few days I gave up in frustration. The feet are constantly getting in the way and make cutting very difficult. They are nothing but a bother and a nuisance. And with such a smooth bottom I found the board constantly sliding across the counter. How about some no-slip pads of some sort?
3,not so great.,"I was pretty disappointed with this product. It looked great when I first got it, but after just a few weeks it developed a pretty large crack along one of its seams. I don't use it for anything but kneading bread, and I haven't mistreated it in any way. I expected better quality. It's still useful, just not as well-made as I thought it would be."
4,"Medium Size Board Is Great, Does Lack Juice Channel","This is decent medium to small cutting board. The board is 14""x10""x1""h. The board lacks a channel so a towel or other absorbent base is needed when cutting ""juicy"" food.I give this cutting board 4 stars because the price is little to charge for a 1"" thick birch ""double head"" Henckels board.I always apply a generous dosage of food grade mineral oil to all my wooden cutting boards and I never place wooden cutting boards in a dishwasher. Under these conditions I have found this board both durable and attractive.I have different cutting boards for different size jobs and also for different types of foods. For cutting vegetables this board has become a favorite of mine and if the board starts getting full I simply unload some of the contents to another boards and continue cutting."
4,Nice cutting board,Nice size for a cutting board. Solid construction. Rubber pegs on the corners to give the cutting board some traction. Great for cutting meat or vegetables. I am using this to replace a plastic cutting board that was way to large. This cutting board is small enough to fit on a small counter and has a nice feel when you are using your Henckels knives!It could be made of higher quality wood but for the price what more can you expect!
2,not so hot,"Cheap, yes, namebrand, yes, but this cutting board splits apart, causing unhygenic gaps where food can accumulate. Look elwhere for better quality. not recommended."
5,Nice Cutting Board,"I am really pleased with this cutting board. The wood grain is really attractive. I din't realize it would have little feet on one side, which is fine, but you can't turn it over and use both sides."
3,warped out of the box,"I am a big fan of Henckels products, but I should have paid attention to the other reviews. I just opened up the box and pulled the cutting board out to find that it was warped. I can only hope that after use/ washing that it doesn't get worse. Also, the rubber pegs are stapled onto the cutting board which I thought to be a bit tacky. Overall, you get what you pay for and I indeed received a 10.00 product."
1,I like it,"*** Updated *** This cutting board is a huge disappointment. I owned this board all of 2 weeks before it (no kidding) fell apart. It was an impressive board by first impression. Save your money. I knew Henkels recently began making low end items, but never this cheaply made. I am now a ""Never Again"" buyer of Henkels. Shop around. This is an update of my previous (first impression) of this product. Previous ""5 Star"" review was as follows:I have to say I really like this board. It's a very simple board with nice thickness and rubber feet. It is a perfect size unless you are preparing food for more than say, four guests. The price is unbeatable. (...)I recommend it fully."
1,Not that great.,This item took up so much space. It made my tv look so much smaller than it already is. Reception didn't get that much better even if I placed it close to the window or other spots in my room. I'd suggest you get a regular rabbit ears antenna.
1,Disappointing,"After half an hour of adjusting the gain and trying the antenna in a few different positions around the TV, it still did not even look as good as my old non-amplified rabbit ears. Yes, it is low-profile, but it definitely isn't producing the ""audio/visual clarity you'd expect from a much larger unit."" I will be returning this product."
3,works OK for nearby HD channels,"This antenna works decent for me because I live about 10-15 miles from my local HDTV transmitters. If it was any further I think this just wouldn't work. Other thoughts: The BRIGHT BLUE LED on the front is very distracting, I had to cover it up with tape because it would light up the room at night (bedroom) and it was bad enough it would keep me awake."
1,Useless - avoid!,"I bought this from somewhere else, and I'm sorry I did. This is one of the worst antennas I've used. Probably passable for analog signals, it really is not very good for digital signals at all. The built in ""amplifier"" does nothing for the signal either. There's really nothing to this antenna... definitely nothing even remotely close to what you're paying for this antenna. Avoid."
1,Not what I had hoped for,"I was very disappointed in the vinyl mattress protector I ordered. It was difficult to ""maneuver"" to get it onto my mattress and then when I finally got it on, the zipper broke right where it begins to zip. I definitely would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone to buy."
4,Capri is challenging! And a bit off-beat,"We like adventure games without much danger and this answered our needs. The touring of the island is very interesting - the maps are VERY small, though, so we had a lot of trouble reading the street names. Also some knowledge of spanish or italian is helpful, as the english is a bit rough (but charming). The puzzles were fun, but non-intuitive. I recommend this for several hours of escape!"
1,A Quiet Weekend Spent-Doing-Absolutely-Nothing in Capri...,"Well...I wanted to like this game. I am incredibly patient with games, I like a nice quiet adventure, I still enjoy text games--I even got all the way through ""Riddle of the Sphinx"" without a walkthrough. But this game takes the cake for boring. In a nutshell, this is a slideshow of pictures of the Island of Capri, with no animation, very tiny hotspots, scattered dialogue from 'characters' whose lips do not move (one amusing moment was hearing a dog bark and seeing, you guessed it, a picture of a dog!), narrow storyline and convoluted mapping. I'll admit I didn't finish it, but after spending literally 5 hours trying to find something to do, I wanted my weekend back. Maybe some may like it, but to me Myst is like an edge-of-your-seat thriller in comparison. I'll go play Shivers again or buy the latest Dreamcatcher instead. Good thing I only spend $3 on it at a garage sale..."
1,Easily the worst game you'll ever pay $20 for.,"You remember the last time one of your friends had you over to look at the pictures from their vacation? Well, this is the video game equivalent.A Quite Weekend In Capri is nothing more than thousands and thousands of rather lackluster photos that could have been taken by any amateur photographer. There really isn't any game here... at least not that I found during the hour of time I wasted.If clicking endlessly through pictures is your idea of fun, this is the game for you. If you're looking for an immersive world similar to Myst, keep looking.I can't believe this game is sold in major retail outlets."
1,Primative and boring...,"I awaited this game's release with great enthusiasm based on the reviews but upon installing couldn't believe the primitive interface and was actually shocked that the game was full of photos of Capri. Yes, photos; your interaction is with still photos of people, places and things. You must click, click, click photo after photo. And, good luck in finding the cursor to proceed; I had to move the cursor in circles around the screen trying to find the hotspot. I didn't even care to continue this game to find out if there was a story somewhere in the cobbled streets of Capri. I do hope this is not going to be the future of adventure games. Needless to say, I uninstalled this game and will be wary of buying any more games from GOT Game again....."
1,A Lousy horrible game that.........SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!,"I never write any reviews online. Thought I have to do so to save other people from buying this horrible game......basically the game is 2D and not 3D.....just a slide show of low resolution photograhs of island Capri....any rookie can take better pics than those......there is no story and consequently there is no game...icons need to be more professionally displayed as they needed an adult to draw them......you might see on the game pack ""THEY ARE FOLLOWING YOU...."" I have no idea who the heck are those following me.....game is so lame and bland and it stops when you stop clicking the mouse without any idea why you do so...........the map they give you needs another map to figure out what's in there.......you just see pics of people with some recorded messages that only reminds me of the TOEFL test..........in summary....please DO NOT BUY THIS GAMe and if you did.........throw it away!"
2,Pretty Pictures but...,"If your looking for a point and click game with pretty pictures, this game would be for you. I was drawn to this game because the reviewers compared it to myst. Myst is so much better, a real game while this is like a slideshow with a few puzzles."
1,"Should get 0 stars, but not an option","I was drawn to this game by one thing, and it turned out to be FAR from the truth, in my opinion. The Box says ""think Myst but in a real location"" not only does it not even compare to Myst in any way, but I found it boring, tedious, and pointless, and after 2 days of wandering aimlessly through it and having no fun at all, I uninstalled it."
5,Really Capri!,"I enjoyed this game and played it twice. I just got back from a vacation in Italy. On our tour we spent a day in Capri and Anacapri. I felt that I actually had been there because the streets were the same, the names of the streets and the hotels and buildings. I knew where I was going because of this game. I even went to the newsstand and the lady was working there that had appeared in the game. I guess they actually used the people on the island to make this game. I even took her picture. This is a very relaxing game and the first one I had played with actual scenery and streets that you could walk anywhere. I loved the game."
5,A Quiet weekend in Capri,"Very nice game! For true adventure gamers. As you go through, you will enjoy the beautiful landscapes and the music.Do not expect astounding 3D graphics, but a real place and an intriguing storyline.Highly recommended."
2,It is really this bad.,"Okay, I never do this, but I had to because this game is just that bad. The ONLY reason I gave it two stars is because at least the pictures are good, graphically. But that's it. I didn't even continue to play this game because it was just too awful. It's great if you don't like 3-D game play, but for those of us who like true adventure games, like Myst, Syberia and the like, are just going to be bored senseless. Anyway, if you want a ""true"" adventure game, I don't think this is what you are looking for."
2,Beautiful photos...but,"For some reason I thought this game was a 3-d immersive game...not a series of snapshots. If you want a set of photos of Capri, buy this. If you're looking for an adventure...look elsewhere."
4,pros and cons of Capri,"This game offers many strenghts but it does have few weaknesses. My final verdict is positive because I like new things. Someone else said: ""Think of it as taking a vacation rather than playing an adventure game - an escape from your usual gaming trips"". This description fits very well the game .Cons:- limited interaction with characters- the beginning is quite confusing- the interface is simplePro:- very easy to use- the storyline gets more and more interesting toward the end- freedom to explore every single spot of the island- the game runs well and has low system requirements"
4,A little gem,"I was skeptical when I heard about this game. An adventure game set in Capri? But this little gem has more than exceeded my expectations. Challenging, mind-stimulating puzzles set in a beautiful scenery... this game is not for people who can't deal with a challenge. The game play is fine but it has some flaws. Too much walking. But overall it's a breath of fresh air compared to other games!Overall rate: 4/5"
4,Not a bullet fired,"I must say I found this game very enjoyable. The game has nice pictures and the sound is pretty good too, the voice acting has italian accent. The gameplay revolves around puzzle solving, not a bullet fired. Overall I found this game well balanced... the puzzle are always logical. Some of them are really hard! A must buy for point and click fans and well worth a try for those wanting to try a title from the genre out...."
4,Cute game,"It's a really cute game with a compelling story. I just didn't get into as much as others, but it's more a personal preference.It actually brings new things to the genre. Although not quite as good as new releases such as Black Mirror, it comes in a close second. This game includes atmospheric soundtrack. Far better music than most computer games usually have.If you are into adventure games, buy this game!!"
2,Didn't really like it,"This game is all about the scenery. The photos are beautiful but all you seem to do is walk, walk, walk. I should have known that I was doomed to disappointment when I saw the simplistic graphics on the opening screen. If you want to take a tour and learn all about Capri then by all means, buy the software. If you want an adventure game look elsewhere."
1,Horrible!,"Im a college student, and have played many mystery games. This one IS life life *the only positive side of it*, but its VERY hard to follow along- and bout half is not in english!!!"
1,the sorriest game,"i did not like this game, i play alot of games, and own quite a few (400) this game was stupid and the map is so small you can't make out what the street are.i thought it was a total waste of money."
1,WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Do NOT buy this game! This is the worst game I EVER bought!
3,"Not a polished game, but quite fun.","I have not finished this game yet, but if you're looking for a proffessional job, why pick an INDIE GAME? (independent developer). It doesn't seem to have a huge plot or any character developement, but I thought it was fun. Way to many places to explore though, I was always lost. Overall a fun game but should be $10 instead of $20."
4,Potentially a Great Product but...,"I used ACT prior but I needed more flexibility with the data, rather than just a contact manager. I was talked into going to Goldmine. Yes, it offered me much more of data management that I needed in a contact manager. However, for such a great product the customer service and home office support is as bad as it gets. I have yet to get an answer to my questions and issues. Forget about using their home page. I just tried to upgrade to 6.0 from the email they sent me. Can't do it and can't find it on the home page. No surprise. If you get Goldmine, and it is a potentially great program, expect to find a local VAS for software assistance, you won't get it from the home office."
2,I give up,"After trying to use Goldmine for 6 months, I finally gave up and switched to Act. Sure, you can customize to your heart's content but it was too complicated and had too many ""bells and whistles"" to make it practical for me and my small business. I never did figure out how to print labels or use half the features, evern after hiring a private tutor to help me out. I had to type all my addresses into a separate file for labels, etc. before importing them. So why bother doing twice the work? I'm no techno-babe but this was just too much for me. I've had Act for a month now and use it all the time, much more user-friendly for me."
1,Raging piece of garbage,"Stay away from this badly designed, badly written program. Yes, it does everything advertised but it is horrendously convoluted, non-intuitive, and frquently crashes the entire machine. I've never seen a piece of software that burns so much produciton time carrying out the simplistic funcitons that this program tries to provide. If you are looking for business software that will streamline the way you do things & help make you more productive, this is not it. If you buy it, you're wasting your money. If you use it already, you're wasting time, you can do much better than this garbage."
1,Goldmine Business Contact Manager,"This software is a nightmare. Do not buy this. Installation was a nightmare in itself, will not read BDE. Support is not a big help."
1,Gold mine Failed a Fundamental Paradigm,"I recently started in a company that used GM religously, its the back bone of all text communication of this company. Yes GM has lots of bells and whistles but the major flaw is that Gold mine does NOT ADAPT TO THE END-USER. The end-user must adapt to GM's way of organization and thats just wrong. Technology should work FOR the people, not the other way around. i hear this bull from vendor's saying ""your supposed to purchase training courses to unleash the full potential of Goldmine"". Thats a load of the brown stinky stuff. If I knew what I know now about Goldmine, I would of reconsidered my salary request because of the things I have to deal with. And if i ever change jobs, I would never work for a company that use Goldmine."
4,Superior product,"I tried Act! and Maximizer before finally choosing Goldmine. Act! is a great flat file system, but you can't easily group contacts into organizations. Maximizer and Goldmine are much further ahead in providing a functionally rich contact manager. Goldmine is just that bit better in ease of use, documentation and support."
3,Version 6 and still single byte,"As a version 5 user, I had hoped that version 6 would finally handle European and Asian languages, but it doesn't. For personal use I'm going back to Outlook."
3,The Book is Better!,"While I liked the movie... I liked the Book way better. The movie just didn't have enough detail about Sting journey to Jesus. If you collect Sting then get the movie, otherwise I wouldn't recommend ordering it."
1,Androgyner Gesang,"Selten habe ich eine so eine schlechte Blues-CD gehört,odder?Der androgyne Gesang von Robben Ford ist nicht Fisch, nicht Fleisch, sondern Soach!"
4,Flawless guitar - studio vocals,"I love Robben's guitar work and I love the blues. My first impression though is that the vocals lack feeling, lack punch, lack that raunchy edge that puts the feeling into a blues piece by say BB or Stevie Ray or Elmore or Robert ... Of course, for a guitar enthusiast ... that can be a minor drawback. Listen to the clips, if you love great guitar work you'll probably buy this one."
2,Talk to Your Disappointed Daughter,"I have been a Robben Ford fan since the Court & Spark tour and have seen him play whenever I hear about it. I buy all Robben's CDs and will continue to buy his CDs, but since '97 I have given them away. I love the blues (The Mint gig with Roscoe ruled), and I love jazz (Detroit with Miles was awesome), but I don't love Robben's recent recordings. Save your money and go seen some fine players at your local blues club tonight."
3,"Good, not great.","First of all, this is (or should be) an album for guitar players. And as always, Robben Ford sounds terrific. Seven stars for his playing. Unlike a lot of guys, he just keeps getting better.But after the first cut--a sort of Robben Ford meets Sam & Dave thing--the rest of the tunes just plod along. None of them is as catchy as I'm Your Man or Talk To Your Daughter. Some songs have changes that are clever, like when Scott Henderson plays blues but clever doesn't get my feet tapping.Last but not least, he sings. And sings. We can argue if he's the greatest vocalist since Caruso but the lyrics are just filler.Robben Ford has so many killer albums its hard to pick but if you want one that will give you chills look for the semi-bootleg Live In San Francisco. In the middle of a long and brilliant solo he cuts from I'm Your Man to Purple Haze. Robben Ford playing Purple Haze...need I say more?"
5,Blue Moon Fever,"I've got the Blue Moon fever for a week now. The symptoms are you are unable to get in the car without putting Robben Fords newest release in and turning it up. Blue Moon, Robben's best since 1988's Talk to Your Daughter, is habit forming. Every time I listen it keeps getting better. Do yourself a favor and catch the fever too get Blue Moon you won't be dissapointed."
5,Buy it!,"Robben's combination of a great guitar tone, and soulfull songwriting bring his music to life. The fact that he also plays the piano on this album outlines the talent this man has. For me this is his best album to date. Buy it!"
3,A mixed review,"All the good things from the other reviews are correct. Versatile, long warranty, easy to clean, etc. But there is a catch. I purchased only for wheatgrass which I juice daily for health reasons. The manual says to feed very small quantities at a time, less than with other juicers, OR SEVERAL OF THE PLASTIC BITS won't take the strain. So you can either constantly watch how you feed the hopper or pay the price. I am on my third juice strainer (an internal non-optional part) because the other two shattered. Not a pretty sight. Keep this in mind"
5,Awesome juicer!,"This is the best juicer I have ever used. I have used the Juiceman and the Jack Lalanne juicers, but this one tops them both. It is quiet; there is less mess and reduced vegetable/fruit waste; and it is easier to clean. The fact that it is multifunctional (making pasta, sorbets, baby food, peanut butter, etc) is a bonus."
5,Love the Cloud story,A continuation of the Cloud story. There is a couple of parts that could be scary for the younger children. My suggestion is that you watch it with your child the first time. A beautiful Nature story.
3,"Cloud ""A study on American Nature""","I am quite satisfied with the DVD series that I bought on the story of a stallion named ""Cloud"". The scenic backdrop of the nature documentary is spectacular. Of course, my opinion on the horses will be a biast one but; they were all very beautiful and interesting especially with regards to the intracacies of ""herd"" life. If you like watching nature documentaries then this will be a pleasent addition to your collection."
2,"Beautiful, broken, and upset.","I had just gotten the lasagna pan for christmas. I fell in love with it the moment i saw it. I recently moved in with my fiancee and have been having a hard time with finding things in the house to make due with for cooking things in the oven. So when i got the pan, i loved it. The color was amazing and it was the perfect size. I couldnt wait to use it.I had only used it TWICE when i came home to a broken pan. My fiancee said that when he was washing the dishes he noticed it was leaking, and then it broke in an almost straight line, leaving two big broken pieces and me very upset. I cant say for the rest of the Sango sets or pieces, but i can say that i know i will not be purchasing this brand."
1,Broke in the oven,"This dish broke on my second time using it in the oven. I was pulling out and it broke into 3 pieces. Too bad they call this pan oven safe, because it is not.I thank Amazon for offering to replace or refund it. That is good customer service."
1,Amazingly short life span,"I only had the lasagna pan for a short time and used it maybe four times. It was in the oven and simply broke into three large pieces. It didn't go from cold to hot or hot to cold, it was just in the oven and broke. I don't know what was wrong with it, but I am having a hard time contacting the company."
1,Broke after one use,"Beautiful looking but the quality is sub-par to say the least. I had bought this piece along with two bowls which had plastic lids. This one broke after one use, the lids didn't fit my bowls. Poor to no quality control in this product."
3,I don't know what to think,"I LOVED this dish! The color is so beautiful. Unfortunately, it cracked down the middle. I thought this was my oven, but from another review, maybe it really is the dish. :["
1,Sango Brown Lasagna Dish,"I made lasagne, put it in the oven at 350 degrees and the dish completely cracked in half."
4,"4 1/2"" Dry Core Bit","Great value and works like it should. Can't comment on it's life as I've only cut through about 12"" of concrete so far. However I see no visible signs of wear."
3,"an okay shoe, not one of my favs from sketcher","I love the Sketcher brand. I own several shoes under this brand name. I was a little shocked when I opened up the box. I thought I ordered white and these were white and pastel colored. I quickly logged onto my order page and double checked what I selected. I did pick white/multi. However, the picture that populates when you select that color was poorly taken. Now that I know these are pastel, I can kind of see it in the photo. I probably should have ordered a 1/2 size smaller. They are a tiny bit bigger than they should be. Not much, with a thicker pair of socks I'll be okay. I do like the shoes. The style is cool and they are very lightweight. I've already received compliments on them. However, the pastel is so not me. I just make sure I wear longer jeans when I wear these shoes. Just right for the price. BTW... each velcro (there are 4) strip is a different color. That's the only place you see color on the white/multi shoe."
5,Reading-Literature Fifth Reader,"Actually, the images, which are black and white with some ""splashes"" of yellow/bronze color, are better than I had anticipated. And, the packaging on the book was excellent and the address labels clear."
3,"A good adapter, but doesn't fit all cameras.","I purchased this adapter for my Samsung Digimax360 which uses a 3.3V adapter. Unfortunately, none of the adapters fit it, so be aware if you own a Samsung digital camera.Also, included are several adapter pieces which are loose. The adapter doesn't have any handy snap-in place of the extra adapter pieces or any compartment, which means that most likely people will end-up losing the pieces in a very short period of time."
2,Dependability,"This item failed after eight months of minimal use. This DC power supply was used very lightly and not abused (as in dropping, etc.)."
3,A Book of Diminishing Effects,"A big admirer of Merlis's novel AMERICAN STUDIES and a huge of fan of classical mythology and literature, I was looking forward to this book when I first read a UK review of it under the title of PYRRHUS. The first several chapters of the book charmed me with the image of a Greek god (twice-removed) transformed into a ""Greek god"" dancing nude at a stripper club. As the book moved from this delightful and superficial conceit to attempt something more serious and profound, it lost, I felt, a lot of its charm and wit and declined into well-charted areas, in recent gay lit anyway, of thinly disguised diatribe and sentimentality. I'm all for diatribe and sentiment, in fact, but, like anything else, they need the sparkle of original and creative thought, instead of the well-worn template Merlis allowed himself to follow after the opening chapters. Better to have fresh and wonderful superficiality, than moth-eaten, rote (pseudo-)profundity."
3,Ambitious but ultimately disappointing,"A very ambitious novel that reimagines Sophocles' Philoctetes as a gay fantasy story set during the Trojan War and uses anachronisms like Baz Luhrman does in his films. For me, however, all the trappings didn't mask a bland story about a hustler looking to escape and a look at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic."
1,Dull,"The book had an interesting premise, but the story itself seemed lackluster and none of the characters had any redeeming social value--they were all so relentlessly self-absorbed as to make me depressed. Mostly the story was rather dull, even the sexual parts, and the author kept breaking the fourth wall to explain why he didn't know his characters. If you're the author and you don't understand your own character, something in your story is flawed."
3,Not up to his best,"I must admit that reading all the reviews in this section made me return to ""An Arrow's Flight"" after a very uninspired first reading when it was released. Surely, I thought, all these readers got something I missed. I re-read the book, and while I agree that it is a fun way to look at mythology again, I think this book pushes the envelope of credibilty as far as creating real characters about whom we are able to care. Merlis certainly knows his craft as ""American Studies"" attests. I think the novel is a fun romp through very ""cute"" references, but on the whole it fails to linger as anything more. But at least I trust his ability and eagerly await a new work to reinforce the promise he has established as a writer to watch"
2,Did I miss something?,"Maybe I should have been more familiar with the Greek tragedy this story is based on? Frankly, I'm not sure what purpose was served by switching back and forth from Classical Greece to modern day. What I did like was the very on target insights as to how a gay man feels from adolescence to adulthood. Personally I think the book would have been just as effective by just keeping it as historical fiction.I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone."
1,A waste of words,"While I pride myself in being able to read any book, this book was an impossibility. Not only was the narration rambling and pointless, the characters were poorly developed. This book was selected for a GLBT book group I belong to and no one enjoyed this book. I honestly don't know what was Merlis' point in writing these senseless words, chopping down precious trees for paper and robbing money from unsuspecting readers. This is one of the few books in existence that really should not have been thought about, written, published or read."
5,How Did Merlis Do This????,"I read all the reviews (all raves), and I still was totally prepared to dislike this book. I mean, come on! A novel about ancient Greek characters, awash in anachronisms and thinly veiled references to gay life today?But Merlis does it! He pulls it off spectacularly! The book is funny and aphoristic without ever being corny. It's touching and fairly rings with truth without ever becoming sentimental. And, all right, yes, it is an allegory, but it's unlike any you've ever read before. If the characters are not as deeply fleshed out as people in a comparable Isabelle Allende novel, they reflect various sections of today's gay/non-gay society with the precision of a clear mirror.Trust me, guys: get this book. Against all odds, it works on many wonderful levels. Mr. Merlis is a magician."
4,Great concept and a compelling read,"This is a great concept for a novel: re-telling a story from ""The Iliad"" in a modern-day, gay context. It's like the best science fiction, where you enter a fascinating world that's related to your own and familiar in some ways, but exotically different. And I think for the most part this novel lives up to the promise of its concept. First of all, it's a compelling story - these stories haven't survived for 3,000 years for nothing - and the author has a great voice. I also found the meditations on fate, destiny, heroism, etc., very thought-provoking, as well as the ultimate message: gay men have to subvert the old stories to create a new definition of what being a man means (I don't think that gives anything away). My biggest complaint is that I didn't really like Pyrrhus - he's basically a dumb hunk - and I also don't identify with the milieu where the novel takes place. The world of discos and strip bars is not the only gay world that exist."
5,Another triumph for Merlis,"After reading and thoroughly enjoying Merlis' first novel, ""American Studies"", I was eager to read his second novel. It did not disappoint; if anything, he has gone beyond what he accomplished in ""American Studies"". At first I was a bit leery of the transposition of contemporary Western culture on the ancient Greek characters, but he succeeds brilliantly with this rather risky proposition. Unlike ""American Studies"", the book is shot through with a healthy dose of graphic sex scenes, adding to a sense of reality in an otherwise rather allegorical tale. Merlis makes his political points in a way that goes beyond the usual rhetoric; as a gay male, I found it both comforting and challenging."
3,Couldn't Pull It Off (so to speak),"I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. I loved it for the first 100 pages. Unfortunately, this novel is a great idea that degenerates into a talky, preachy, too-obvious ramble. I can look beyond the basic (and I do mean basic) plotting problems in the book's Lemnos section, but the pace and the characters are uneven. The opening break-neck pace eventually grinds to a virtual stand-still, and Merlis doesn't seem to know who his main character is as the story progresses. It's as if the author got half-way through a great book, then got tired and said, ""The hell with it,"" and cranked out a weak second half just to get it done. Doesn't live up to his first work."
4,"Finally, gay fiction on a literary par with Patrick O'Brien!","The mixing of modern and ancient mind-concepts, making both readily accessible to the modern reader, coupled with a use of language approaching the mastery of Patrick O'Brien's Aubrey/Maturin series, makes this saga an masterwork of story-telling and a awe-inspiring use of the English language."
2,Way too small to be practical,"I bought this set because I was looking for a sake set that I can actually use--i.e. heat sake in the jar. What I got was mostly decorative piece that looked nice, to be sure, but was not really practical, because it was way too small. Also, heating sake in the jar appeared to damage it.Overall, if you want a decorative piece, I think the set is fine; if you are looking for a set you can actually take out of the pretty wooden box and use, this is not."
4,Nice book,"I bought this used, but it was as good as new. The patterns are great and it appears to be well written."
3,Sander belt,"Item arrived as promised. The splice is high and not the quality I expect in relation to other brands. Works, but could be better"
5,one of the best books of poetry i have read,"As someone who spends a good portion of life with people during their most exposed times, its hard to find an author who doesnt candy coat life. Daniel Joshua Nagleberg is honest in his work. ""Man falling backwards down stairs"" left me speechless. This book is brutally honest and that is refreshing in these times of stripsearches and armed guards."
4,Great Information!,"I think this book is very usefull and descriptive. Is very difficult to find today graphic design books with information you can use in your everyday work.Usually there are a lot of books with images and graphic examples, but what about theory?! I highly recommend this one."
1,Gerbils destroyed it in 3 weeks.,"It may be cheap, it may be cute but it does not hold up to gerbils chewing.We have two young gerbils, they have cardboard and sticks in their cage at all times; both of them liked to snuggle up to each other and sleep together inside this igloo.BUT, for whatever reason, they decided to chew their igloo to bits! After 3 weeks there is only one-third left of the little igloo house.(They also chewed the edges off of their heavy-duty plastic food bowl, I switched to a metal bowl. They have an ""old-fashioned"" metal exercise wheel that they gnaw on.)"
5,My hamsters love it.,"We have two Winter White hamsters and this is the perfect size for them. It is their favorite place to hide. The two of them fit nicely in there and there's room for shredded bedding, too.My favorite part: they can't chew and destroy it and it is easy to clean, doesn't hold odors. I once bought them one of those cool wooden houses and had to throw it out, because they eventually stink. Now, I know better and buy one I can sanitize."
4,cute,My mice sometimes use this igloo. My only complaint (besides being unable to choose a color) is that they can easily tip it over.
3,"Well,","I think this house is OK. I recommend the Planet PETCO Small Animal Hideaway though. Only because with these igloo's you can see through them. With the product I recommend you can not. I had an igloo but ended up giving it away becuase I would wake my hamster when I walked by her cage because she could see me! These houses arent the best and get chewed up very easily! Also you have no idea what color you will get. I was hoping for a yellow, but got pink. Check this house out if you want to get a nice onePlanet Petco Small Animal Hideaway, 5"" L X 6.75"" W X 4.75"" H"
5,The Best Knives I'VE ever used!!,"I'm no knife expert, but I've never regretted purchasing this set: they're beautiful and they really do the job! To be able to easily slice through raw meat, vegetables, tough skinned tomatoes - well, it's a pleasure to work with these knives! I can't recommend them highly enough!"
4,warning - item rec'd not as pictured on Amazon's site,"Item received is NOT as picutred. The knife block I received has extra slots for steak knives instead of the scissors as pictured. With the block I rec'd, the slot for the scissors is in an awkward spot and I have no intention of buying steak knives. Amazon is trying to rectify this, but I'm not sure of the outcome as this point. The knives look great and exactly what I was looking for."
5,Great Knives Great Price here on AMAZON,"I have been using ""store"" brand knives for a long time before i purchased these. This was my first shot at using really good knives. I bought these and they are well worth the $$$. I cant believe how sharp and precise these things are.i can trim fat off meats like a laser beam. tomatoes cut easily. I highly recommend any one that is ready to make the jump for the store brand to a good set of German Steel German made knives to try these out."
3,it's not a lie,To the one star review: What are you talking about? The description clearly states what it is.
1,Not a compliation,"I must have not read the description well, but I assumed that there was a compilation of songs included, in addition to some assorted interviews. But nope. Nothing here."
5,Great Book!,This is one of the best Bailey School Kid's book's that I have read and I have read a lot of them. It was fun to read. I checked it out at the library and wanted to buy my own copy. I did!
4,Progressions Plusss,"Christine Shaw's, Predictive Astrology, is not only a well-written and understandable guide, it is thorough and comprehensive for the intermediate level astrology student. Although the book does not really teach the reader how to ""predict the future,"" it does guide the reader in finding the signposts for the possibilities that are out there for all to see. An excellent addition to any student forecaster's library. Crisp, clean and thoughtful."
3,a simple and pleasant study,I am from INDIA. I come accross with so many books on this subject. But the work by CHRISTINE SHAW is very much outstnding by its quality.The command on the subject is commendable. She takes the reader simply along with her explaining all about the art of prediction which is nucleus of the subject.The simple style of narration will have a pleasant going through the book all the time.It is a must to a beginner. It draws simply to the essential area of the vast subject.
4,Great Addition to the Library of a Counseling Astrologer,"This book is full of practical experiences she has had with her clients, as well as great insights gleaned from 30+ years of astrology. This book is great for an astrologer already familiar with ""predictive"" astrology, who is counseling, or considering counseling. My only complaint is that the book is a bit disjointed, by that I mean info is scattered throughout when it could be consolidated under the chapter headings a bit better-but overall, this book is well worth the price."
3,Porn has a history.,"I read this more than 15 years ago for an undergraduate class at Brown University. (I actually dropped the class 'cuz I was too lazy to write the final paper and I thought the prof rhymed with witch.) In the same way that ""Epistemology of the Closet"" starts with an interesting anecdote or premise, this author asks, ""What do we do when we uncover household objects from Pompeii that show beastiality or backdoor sex and other things that would shock us?"" There's a great documentary on DVD about porn that defines the medium as ""work of a sexual nature that a segment of the population are not allowed to see."" That sure beats Meese's definition. This book asks who gets to see these old artefacts and what does the ""censoring"" of the material say about our culture. Okay, I'm a bit foggy on the details, but I remember this being a solid text. I recall just enough that I can faithfully say that folk should feel free to read it."
4,Bought Aug. 2004,"Just wanted to say that this has been working well in my Panasonic cordless phone since 2004. I think the life is starting to go down, but it's given 3 years of reliable service, and I think that's good."
3,OK for starters...,"I purchased this book because I thought it would be an interesting/entertaining thing to have around, yet I am terribly glad that I did not pay full price for it. I immediately found that it leaves a lot to be desired and is poorly edited (it includes typos, a few missing illustrations, etc.). The cross-references are OK. Additionally, anything in this book is available to you on the internet - and in much greater detail. It is likely that Wikipedia will give you more help.Its only consolation is that it can be used as a suitable jumping-off point if one feels the need to jump off of nowhere. If you have a topic in mind that you want to research, just go to the internet, or to your library. If you want to simply peruse, magazine-style, it works."
1,These shears don't cut it,"The first use wasn't too bad. It cut things well but the lock locks too easily, without something even touching it, so it had to be unlocked multiple times during use. Safety is nice,but that is just annoying.The biggest problem is the coil/spring is NOT stainless-steel so the inside of it rusts, even if you take it apart for each washing. Once it gets rusty it becomes very very difficult to close the shears, making cutting a real pain, literally. I soak the spring regularly in rust remover but I can not use it for more than a single piece now without horrible aches in my hand.My prior shears lasted for 10 years, but these I need to replace after a couple of months..."
2,Manufacturer's Warranty,Anyone with any rust issues should contact Henckels from their website and get a replacement. The blades are guaranteed to be rust free. Don't mention the rusty spring issue or they'll only send a replacement spring.
2,I expected more from Henckels,"I gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months, even cut through chicken bones. But just like the other reviews, the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment. I used these for making chicken soup alot, but noticed that it also doesn't always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken I like to be extra careful. So the next set I get I'll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from Henckels this time."
1,Coil rusted.,"As others have said, the coil rusted. Then on my pair the coil snapped off yesterday and I almost cut my hand badly. Very dangerous.On the other hand they were good for cutting, but still a pain to use. I'm only writting this to save someone a seriously cut finger or hand."
1,Don't waste your money on these,These cut great if you have big strong hands. I have small hands and arthritis and the handles are so big they are really hard to get a good hold on them. The button that locks them is difficult to lock and unlock. The spring rusts and each time I want to use them I have to open and close them several times to get them to loosen up so they can be used without them sticking. Very disappointed Henckels put out something so horrible. Don't waste your money on these.
4,Very Good Poultry Shears,"I've not had any of the troubles other reviewers have mentioned such as rust, locking up, etc. I wash them by hand, then dry them right after use. Since these shears are the first poultry shears I've ever used, I've nothing to compare them to. ButI find them to be powerful shears with a good spring action, a real aid to cutting up poultry."
4,"Nice design, but almost too big","I think this is well constructed, but when a large quantity of disks are put in, it needs to be handled with caution. Be aware this thing is pretty massive, but its great to have all my disks in one place."
4,Massive!,I like this a lot. It is so big. I doubt I will ever have to buy another one. I do wish the sleeves on the inside were a little higher quality though.
1,NOT IMPRESSED!!!,"I read some decent reviews and purchased this because we have a ton of movies and could use something this big. We filled up about over a fourth of this holder and the plastic, CHEAP handle breaks off!!! Luckily it comes with a strap but I'm hesitant to fill the whole thing of DVDs because the actual strap may break off. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Not sturdy at all!"
2,Big Case cheap CD/DVD sheets,I have a lot of movies and this has a huge storage capacity. the only flaw in this item is it doesn't seem to hold the DVDs into place too well even with the top flap. I find this to be frustrating at times and thing i will be switchin to another case soon. if your going for mass storage it isnt to bad but i will not be using this product to much longer. i wish the sleeves were better quality.
1,520 blue wallet,"Um.. I was expecting a big wallet but this thing is huge..(when full).. and be super careful about the plastic things inside holding the cds in because when u have to tear the peice out of each cd holder before u put ur cd in u may rip some..ABOVE WAS MY REVIEW FROM WHEN I FIRST GOT IT.. ITS BEEN THREE MONTHS SINCE THEN.. I DECIDED TO ADJUST MY REVIEW TO PEOPLE KNOW YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! NOW THREE MONTHS LATER THE PAGES ARE RIPPING OUT AND DVDS ARE FALLING OUT ALL THE TIME.. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN! LEARNING FROM EXPERIANCE HERE.. PAY FOR A ""QUALITY"" PRODUCT NOT THIS!"
5,I like this item.,"My wife and I have a pretty small appartment in S. Philly and I have over 2,000 DVD's & Blue-ray's. They were taking up a lot of space. I bought 2 of these about a month ago and they are great. They really do help to free up a lot of space. They are well built with a handle for easy carring and also a shoulder strap. The pages turn easy and there is no clutter on the inside. The only thing I have negitive to say about them is you have to remove the plastic for every disc you want to put inside. Thats the only part that takes the most time."
4,520 Blue Cd-r Dvd-r Holder Mp3 Wallet Dj Storage Case(new!),520 Blue Cd-r Dvd-r Holder Mp3 Wallet Dj Storage Case(new!)Product is as advertised and is perfect for my use (storing CD's). Pockets are more fragile than I expected.
5,520 blue cd dvd holder-- AMAZING,"I am very pleased with this product. I wish I had more DVD's to fill another one. I need to get more dvds now to fill this one. This holder is HUGE! I MEAN HUGE HUGE. The picture makes it look like a regular sized one, but its like 10 inches tall."
1,"UGH! Plan to spend a day working on ""de-sleeving"" this thing!!!","This is my second large disc case, happy with my first large more expensive leather case. Hate this one. Very cheaply made, plastic liners inside are perferrated and not pre-pulled so you have to pull apart plastic before you can put a single disc in. When you do the plastic lining either tears or is just too time consuming to continue.Terrible purchase. Buck up and spend the extra buck on a leather one."
3,it is a basic cd and disc storage carrier,the ony thing that i would ask for is that it have some more inside pocekts (it only has one and the one pocket that is does have is to flimsy. if i put anting in there it will always fall out. it is a net pocketing with to much elastic for me and what i want to do.
4,"Works in rural Kansas, week remote","We live on a farm 30 miles from a city in KS and have a wide range of signal strengths, from a tower 4 miles away to one 50 miles away. We used the remote to adjust for maximum picture quality for each station and saved the adjustment. With this we can view all channels with a clear picture by using the remote recall the best position for each channel. We can now view several channels without the changing color bands we had before.Only the week remote and the glare off of the display keeps me from a five star award."
1,Don't even bother...,"This is not only, by far, the absolute worst Stormwitch album, but probably some of the most awful music ever recorded. It sounds like they weren't even trying. The music lacks the fire and the passion of their melodic 80's power metal opuses, and it doesn't move or inspire me at all. It sounds like they were trying to imitate the late expermintal, jazzy Led Zeppelin sound, but they are very bad at it. There is even a song in which they tried to incorporate the Spanish Flamenco sound... STORMWITCH DOING FLAMENCO?!?!?! yeah... pretty lame. This disc is absolutely useless to me, so don't make the same mistake. Save your money for ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Stronger than Heaven""."
4,like it alot but a little bulky,"I like this product, it is a little heavy and bulky but gret that is has adapter sizes to choose from. would recommend it."
4,"Does the job, even if it;s somewhat flimsy","It's ceramic, therefore it will sharpen any steel and very useful for the serrated knives. Only issue is, is that anytime i open it, i am afraid i'll break itGood price, good product, flimsy overall design"
1,SUCKED BIG TIME.,"A book that attempted to give the reader 31 ""secrets"" to success and interspersed a bunch of lame ""personal"" stories. It was boring, stupid, and a big waste of both time and money. No, I didn't like it."
5,"Book for all dog fanciers, breeders and non breeders","Bought this book yesterday and it's worth every penny that was spend. Since I dont own a Wolfhound and wanted to know more about them before I got one, this is the perfect book. It has everything you need to know. Not just all the boring Kennel, champion part were most other books go into great detail for those who are interested in showing and breeding. Since I'm not,other things are more important like the character,the history,the feeding of puppy's and adults and all the other things that dog owners find important for everyday life. Thank you very much for writing such a great and informitive book with so many great pictures."
5,Excellent research on the most noblest of hounds,"In my opinion, this is the best book ever produced on the Irish Wolfhound. In depth information which is easily understood by the novice as well as totally absorbing for the more experienced owner. Mary McBryde has done the Irish Wolfhound proud. A must for anyone with interest in this very special breed."
5,"For IW information, the best on the market--fr. a breeder","As a breeder I am always looking for an IW book to recommend to new puppy owners. This is it. It has wonderful and complete information for the new owner and for people who have had Wolfhounds for years. The health section and ""rearing a puppy"" are especially good. A great resource book for any Wolfhound owner."
2,snowflake pin ...expected more,Nice size and nice snowflake pattern but it looks to me like they just sprinkled glitter over the brooch....I expected crystals..If pin has them I can not see them....Very fast shipping..
1,4X4 posi lok DO NOT BUY,"I bought a 4X4 Posi Lok for my low mileage Suburban. The stock actuator failed at the worst time possible. The OEM components were a little more expensive, so a reliable mechanical setup seemed like a good idea. Wrong. I recieved the correct kit that was missing parts. I called the manufacturer, whose rep was friendly the first time, but after not recieving anything for two weeks, I called again and he became surly and informed me he'd probably sent the parts, but that may have been the other guy that needed components to complete his kit! My vehicle was out of service over a month, whereas OEM components could have been installed in a few hours.Do not waste your time and money on 4X4 Posi Lok, go to the dealer and get the right parts the first time."
1,Not very sturdy,"Our daughter's dog is a Golden Retriever. I gave it to him and within a very short time, the ball on one end was already torn off."
4,a real sense of dislcation,"When Mountains Walked is rich with place-related details so exquisite and a real sense of what it means for people to be dislocated, what it means to be a stranger, an alien, both in time and place. Although the novel sags and a bit boring in the middle, it is nevertheless a fine literary achievement, capturing the experiences of the 'locals' where the strangers, especially Maggie, (the lead character) find themselves either redeemed or doomed."
3,"Long-winded, well written, her stories are better","I don't agree with the review posted above except in that Wheeler is a really talented writer. Alas, the short story seems to be more her form. Indeed, the stories in her first collection was beautifully written, emotionally resonant and often funny. Unfortunately her novel could use cutting and is filled with too many plot devices that don't feel quite organic. I don't think Wheeler isn't quite up to handling the longer form."
4,When Mountains Walked,"give me a time. I haven't opened the book yet. I have so many waiting for me to read. 4 stars are a mistake. you won't let me change it. Since I haven't read it yet, I don't know the rating."
1,Poor Quality Steel,After only six (6) cuts (chicken thighs) ... the steel blade had a 1/8 inch nick(not a chip)in it. Definitely not the best quality steel.
1,Many problems with Henckels shears,"I'm on my second pair of these shears. The first pair was inherited when I got married, the second was a gift to replace the first (due to the plastic catch falling out and the blades rusting).In less than one year, the second pair is almost unusable. The coil that is supposed to spring them back into the open position has lost its bounce due to rust inside the coil. The safety catch works too well - it catches automatically almost every time I close the shears. This is extremely annoying when clipping through a chicken breast. I have to stop on every other cut to re-open the shears. Finally, the shears cannot be separated for full cleaning.NOTE that this model has a different catch mechanism, but the coil does look the same."
3,Only partially correct for 2001 A6,"Three star rating as only part of the kit worked. The bolts are the correct ones for remounting the calipers. The rubber boots, however, are not correct. The boots have different sized holes at each and the larger sized hole is too big for the caliper pins. So I did not install the boots as they would not keep dirt out off the pins."
2,Form does not follow function.,"I was looking for recoil mitigation for my Winchester 1300 Defender, what I found with theBLACKHAWK! KNOXX SpecOps Adjustable Black Shotgun Stock - Winchester 12 & 20 Gaugeswas a completely awkward and clumsy stock packed with a fore grip that is just to large. During the recoil movement the gun moves up towards your face (with a slight side to side movement) not back in to your shoulder pocket, when the gun completes it's travel, it's stop is so sudden that it caused shells to ""drop"" from the loading tube. The action will hurt your face and even left a slight bruise on my son's cheek (he's 20yo & 6'3""/full size man with experience shooting shot guns with high brass loads), leading him to tell me he wouldn't shoot that gun again. I just can not recommend this stock however nice it looks, it's just not practical.Lesson learned here, check nutnfancy for reviews before buying this type of equipment. [...]"
4,Wedge design makes for a good fit,"I tried using regular pillows (firm and soft) to support my growing belly, but didn't have much success since there was always lots of pillow in the way that was not supporting me. The Boppy wedge is the right size to fit just where you need it. You can push part of the pillow or all of it under your belly depending on the type of support you want. The Bobby wedge is not a firm pillow. I am pregnant with twins and am now on bed rest. I use this pillow all of the time."
3,Not sure yet...,"Reviews were so good that I decided to order this pillow. I'm used to sleeping on my back so I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping on my side since the 4th month when they recommend you do. I didn't want to buy a body pillow because we have a queen size bed and my husband is tall so the three of us wouldn't have fit in the same bed. I got this one last week, I'm 7 months pregnant now and I just don't know if I like it yet, the first night I hated it and I've been using it for 4 nights now and every night is less bad, but still I can't seem to have a good night sleep on my side. I get a lot of pain on my hips and this is not doing the trick entirely. I think its better than other pillows only because it's so small but you will need additional pillows to be comfortable."
4,Great for 3rd Trimester!,By this time all you are left with is sleeping on your side. This little wedge pillow helps keep your tummy supported which helps keep your hips from being pulled out of alignment. Very handy. Very comfy. Get one.
2,Better for back support,"I bought this despite hearing that it is too hard, and now I wish I would have listened. I am in the last half of my 2nd trimester, so maybe I'll use it more later, but for now it works best for back support when I'm sitting on the couch. When I have used it for sleeping I wake up with a sore abdomen, because the wedge is hard. I also have a snoogle pillow, and find that it works better alone, instead combined with the wedge. I hope the manufacturer will improve upon this wedge by making it with a material more like memory foam, which would make it softer, but still supportive. I am only 5'2"", with a very short abdomen, so maybe the wedge made me sore because it went under my ribs, which were the most tender when I woke up."
2,A pillow is better,"This only provides basic to support to the very side of the belly, nothing to help with the rest or the top."
2,too hard!,I was going to order one of these but ended up finding one still in the package at the thrift store. I'm really glad I didn't pay full price for it because it's way too hard to sleep with. I've had it since about 5 months and now I'm 8 months and having major sleep issues again. The only way it's of any use is to put it under your back if you have another pillow under your tummy. It's just not comfortable though and I end up ditching it for a regular pillow after about 10 minutes. It's not a pillow it's a hunk of very firm foam.
5,I can finally sleep,"Side sleep was painful and no matter how I smooshed a pillow I could not get comfortable. Plus, when you turn over in the night, using pillows takes another adjustment and ultimately wakes you up in frustration. This wedge is simple, fits perfectly under my belly without taking alot of space and flipping over in the night is a breeze! I have seen a few reviews saying too small or too hard...I disagree. If you use it correctly, it is just right. Too soft would render it useless. Anyone that thinks it is too hard just has it wedged too far under the belly...pull it out a little bit. And too big would be bulky and hard to manuever under the covers."
2,Not Worth the Money,Not at all worth it. I bought this pillow about 5 months into my pregnancy because my back was hurting at night. It did NO good and just got in my way! I went to Target and bought a temperpudic (sp) pillow that worked perfectly!
4,Works wonders!,"It does not look like much, but it really has helped me get comfortable on my side and sleep more soundly. I am so much happier going to bed now, where before I would dread having to get comfortable. I've used it every night since I've gotten it. It could be a little softer, but then it may not give me the right support. This is well worth the money."
4,Especially helpful later in pregnancy,"I bought this for my wife, along with the Snoogle pillow, when she was about 4 months pregnant. As the months passed her Boppy was used more and more to support her stomach while sleeping on her side. For the price this is a good purchase and will definitely be worth it in the 7-9 month period."
1,mom-to-be,"I'm sure this pillow works for someone, but not for me. I personally found it horrible. The two nights I used it, I woke up with back pain. It's simply hard and uncomfortable. Find yourself a good, soft pillow that you can smush under your belly and between your legs, if necessary, and you'll be a whole lot happier."
2,Only used it 3-4 times,The pillow is OK. A bit too small for any real support. I may try to use it for my knees after birth.
1,I paid $14.99 for this?,"They need to have a size reference in the picture just so you can see how big this wedge ACTUALLY is. It's tiny! I didn't even support half my belly, and I'm not a very large person! Plus, it's as hard as a rock. I understand that it's for support, but there should be at least SOME cushioning. I mean, pregnancy is already uncomfortable, why make a PILLOW (which are supposed to be soft) that makes you even more uncomfortable. Don't waste your money! Go get a throw pillow from your couch. MUCH BETTER!"
3,an ok product,this product is ok but i wish it were a little bigger. it almost gets lost on my bed. but i still think it's worth having and it does help me not to sleep on my back...
2,I would say Ok,"The wedge is nice if I am sitting on the couch for my back, but not that great for side sleeping. I found a simple pillow does best."
4,Just when I thought nothing would work....,"I love this pillow. I tried using a regular pillow and a body pillow. The pregnancy pillows seem way too big to me to share with my husband and my dog. Plus I'm not sure I want to sleep with something that wraps around me like alien arms. Anywho... both the regular pillow and the body pillow were too much for my belly. I couldn't get comfortable because I couldn't get the pillows underneath me enough. When I saw this wedge shaped thing, I thought that might be the solution. I admit I was very skeptical, but I thought it was worth the inexpensive cost. The wedge gives my stomach the support I need. I still sleep with a second pillow between my legs and the combo of the two helps me from tossing and turning. For a good reference, I'm 29 weeks pregnant."
2,Take it or leave it....,"I am about 7 months pregnant and I can't decide if this pillow was a good investment or a waste of money. It's much smaller than I thought it would be. Before I had this pillow I would just use my regular pillows between my knees, behind my back or to support my belly. This pillow is very hard and I'd rather use a soft pillow under my belly. Maybe as I get further along it will prove to be invaluable, but for now I could take it or leave it. (I do like using it on top of propped up pillows behind my head when I am reading in bed.)"
4,wedge pillow,"Not only would this be great for pregnancy, but we use it under the head of my mattress to tilt my head up, for easier breathing while sleeping.I wish this had been available when I needed it, yrs. ago."
2,Not for everyone,"I bought the Boppy Wedge because it came highly recommended, but have found it too uncomfortable to use. It is very hard and doesn't give at all. I thought I needed to wait till I got bigger, but I am 31 weeks now and it still is not comfortable. Maybe this is more suitable for women who carry bigger and really need the extra support."
2,Save your money!,"I bought this pillow when I was 6 months pregnant and I wish I would have saved my money. It was small, made out of cheap material and it did not provide the support I needed. I wish I would have paid more attention to reviews that warned about this pillow not being worth the money. If you have the money, go with something more expensive or buy a pillow you can physically see before purchasing. This pillow did not work well with my anatomy and I threw it away before my 7th month."
2,not as expected,A standard bed pillow or sofa pillow is more firm and helpful than this product. I would return it but it is not worth the effort.
2,Smaller than I thought,"My boyfriend assembled it before I got home and if I had been there we would have sent it back because it's too small. Good quality, nice wood, very expensive little thing. Amazon messed up my order and wouldn't take my $25 gift card so I ended up paying full price which is a rip off in my opinion."
4,Just fine.,"This figure is quite nice, the arms and the head are very cool, but the base and legs not so much."
5,A gorgeously written book,"This is history written with flair, clarity, and intellectual pizzazz -- a model book. Turn to any page and Nicolson's talent shines forth. To choose an example almost at random, here he is on England under King James: ""Submissiveness and obsequiousness were signals of the social order at work. Social differences between men were not an unfortunate result of economics or power politics, nor a distortion of how things ought to be but a sign that society was well ordered. Life, happily, was arranged on a slope as steeply pitched as a church spire.""A description of the plague: ""People felt they understood the plague. It was a moral affliction which attacked cities because cities were wicked and disgusting. London was a sucking sink of iniquity, with something murderous and dissolving at its core.""The book is a feast."
1,BORING!,The only good thing about this book is that it will make you fall asleep. Highly recommended to insomniacs! I was expecting to learn about the making of the King James Bible and instead got lost in the irrelevant and superfluous material. The appendices are much more insightful and provide more information than the book itself.
1,Dangerous,"I am always suspicious of those who write a book on or about the Bible. Be careful, Adam Nichols in my opinion makes accusations against the Bible translators to discredit the King James Bible. He is doing what is called historical revisionism. For more on this [...]"
1,This is the 21st century...,"Adam Nicolson must be aiming to show that he can copy illegible texts with their original spelling and grammer. As a result, what might have been 'quaint' in a chapter title page or two becomes a very laborious exercise. A potentially interesting topic, Nicolson's insistance on making us all scholars of old English resulted in a better solution to insomnia than an interesting tale."
2,Pretentious and Disappointing,"Nicolson is a genius at making a fascinating subject boring. While there is interesting information here about the Jacobean Age, the text is disorganized and discursive. Not much real information is provided about the Bible itself or the process of its translation. There is nothing about this subject here provided that has not been more effectively presented elsewhere."
2,God's Secretaries,"I suppose because the author is the descendant of Nigel Nicolson, of the Vita-Sackville West connection, reviewers are full of praise for this book. And it's subject matter is of interest to secular and religious readers alike. However, to say, as some have, that this is ""elegantly"" written is to put expectation and sheer fawning ahead of reality. Consider this clumsy sentence: ""Even London, by far the biggest city in England, and on its way to becoming the biggest in Europe, over which on bad days a smog of coal smoke already hung, was still rural in its corners."" Syntax doesn't get more tortured than than. This is not to mention sentences that sometimes reach beyond 65 words. It is as badly written a book as I have ever read and those reviewers who are carried away with the Nicolson name should consider carefully the limits of sycophantic behavior. The King of England was never treated better for less reason."
2,God's Secretaries,"This very interesting topic is spoiled by the pedantic approach of the author. This is true of the lack of creativity in writing and in the vocabulary, which will send even well-educated readers scrambling for a dictionary. I plodded through to the end because the facts were interesting, but it was very tough going. All that research deserved better handling."
3,God's Secretaries,"The book is interesting. It spends more time on the politics of writing the King James Bible, than on what manuscripts were used in writing the Bible."
3,Somewhat Useful But Not Too Much,"This is for anyone familiar with the England of James I and his immediate predecessors a disappointment. But perhaps I should have paid attention to the title, God's Secretaries. The Book is about this strange group of men who retranslated the TyndaleBible but actually made only small changes. It does not deal with a much more important issue, exactly how decisions on translation were made, but the source material is lacking here.The chief attraction then and now of this particular Bible translation is that it is understandable enough for those wanting the meaning of the Scriptures but archaic enough for aesthetic needs and inspiration."
5,A Mysical Book,"I listened to the author during his TV discussion of his book and was enthralled by his knowledge, wit and command of the Engllish language. I had considered the KJV dead till I heard Mr. Nicolson bring it, and those who took part in its translation, alive in all it majesty and, what modern translation miss and cannot accomplish, mystery and awe. The author puts you back into the culture and times that produced this great work and helps you understand why we can't go home again in recreating such a translation today. Much of that has to do with our corssing the cultual evolutionary line into the Enlightenment where logic and understanding superceed mystery."
4,Book is interesting,Book arrived on time for a book club study. Engaging and informative. The book club will be discussing it in November and I appreciate being able to access the book online without having to drive out to a bookstore.
4,Pretty Good Prisoner Companion,"Some good ""behind the scenes"" stories and photos.Has quite a few spelling errors and a couple of sentences that just end in mid thought. Map has errors with missing location numbers and some mismatched descriptions of the location numbers.The included DVD is a disappointment. It contains 2 episodes: ""Arrival"" and the alternate ""Chimes of Big Ben"". Any Prisoner fan that would be buying this book already has these. Something new would have been nice."
5,My order wasn't right,"Hi. I got my books on time, but my bluegrass guitar book was missing the CD it was supposed to have with it. Thats when I found out that Amazon is just about impossible to contact. So if Amazon reads this and are concerned with fixing my order by sending me the cd, i would greatly appreciate it."
2,Not Impressed,"The item was received promptly. However, this item looked cheap. It was not worth the money. I was disappointed."
1,Close but no Cigar..,"This book will only take you so far. Has good chapter on assembly language programming, and also lots of hardware interface examples, even a few introductory type projects at the end of the text, but one big problem that will hold *ANY* beginner back. The source code examples presented is not provided with the text and is not available to download from the web, making it harder to actually try out the examples presented in the text. When contacting the author about getting the source code, his comments were ""I don't have the source code. I would need to retype the examples."" I actually wonder if the author himself actually got any of the samples to work..... Don't waste your time and $$ with this. Get something more practical like ""Walter Fuller's"" book. Lots of interface example, hardware construction tips and full source provided along with a mailing list of people that actually got that system up and running."
3,The kidnapping is getting tiresome,"Every single book in this series has Libertus being kidnapped or thrown in jail at some point. Come on! Am I to believe that he has managed to live as long as he has as both a slave then a freedman without learning how to take better care of himself and to be more aware of his environment? Then he's able to use his skills of awareness and logic to solve mysteries? I just don't buy it after so many book. I'm also not convinced that all the over the top patron and client behavior is reasonable -- Marcus Septimus is not his former master so why does he spend so much time with him again? Where is his real patron, his former master? Anyway, I do still like the major characters and I'm pleased that the plots have allowed their lives to develop toward a new family."
4,It's a hell of a lot better than MK Advance,"Over the yrs, handheld ports of MK games have ranged from absolutely abysmal to merely embarrassing(AHEM...MK Advance), so DA deserves special mention for even displaying a level of competence. The sound is great with good vioce samples and surprisingly potent smacking sounds, and the tight conrols retain an impressive amount of 12 characters maoves, stances, and fatalities. And just like it's console bretheren, there's tons of stuff to unlock, even if it's mostly character palete swaps. The most unfortunate thing about GBA DA is the decision to ape the console version's 3D gameplay when it really wasn't neccessary,the arenas are blocky Mode-7 messes that do impossible Escher things whenever the floor meets the background, and the characters have been pixelated to make the ""scale"". 10 for ambition, at any rate, great game Capcom, keep up the good work."
4,Play tent,"Excellent, well made product. Grandson started playing with & enjoying it immediately after opening. In fact, he insisted on sleeping in it Christmas night."
5,great play tent,My son is two and a half and he got this tent for a Christmas present-we love it-very simple to set up and take down-great fun for playing indoors! Seems very durable
4,Fun in PreK,The tent is quite small but just the right size for one student to fit in comfortably to get away for some down time... It fits perfectly in a small space in my class room. The dimensions were spot on. It is very easy to operate. I sometimes forget how easy it is to open and close and put away out of sight. Ingenious design!
5,One Touch Tent,"Very easy up with a super easy down. Bought this for indoor winter fun with my 2 year old - I'm 5'10"" & we both fit it in comfortably with a few books & small plastic chair. Highly recommend."
2,Ours didn't last an hour.,"We bought this for Christmas for our 4-year-old, and he was so excited to get it Christmas morning. Unfortunately, it kept popping back up, making it unsafe for him to play in, and one of the poles pulled out of the main top piece. I am contacting the company, but am horribly disappointed."
5,Excellent for house play!,"Best item I've purchased in a while. My 6 and 3 year old boys love it! It's sturdy, and they both can fit in it together. It's spacious enough to bring in toys to play with. Highly recommend it."
2,"Fun, but flimsy and easily torn","My kids liked this tent, however it was very flimsy and the fabric tore too easily. We ended up throwing it away after about 3-4 months of use."
3,"collapses constantly, pole broken",My grandchildren absolutely love this. However from day one it has fallen apart. One of the poles comes apart and separates from the rest of the frame. So I am constantly fixing it when they play with it.
2,This item breaks,I ordered this tent for my sons first birthday and it broke right away! I did not have time to return it and now its junk!
5,Great Tent for Kids -- Lots of Indoor and Outdoor Fun,This is a great play tent for kids. Incredibly easy to open and collapse. I had purchased a different tent that required you to insert poles. Too tedious so returned it. Am very pleased with this. Folds as easily as am umbrella. Smart construction with built-in ties to keep door and window open. You can attach a tunnel through the round window for even more fun. Enough room for about four sitting comfortably.
3,A great start -- could have been his best,"Hard to recommend as an unfinished work, but the story development and writing are vintage Fitzgerald. It's worth reading, particularly if you are a fan of Fitzgerald's work."
2,incomplete,"Gatsby is one of my favorite books, and I enjoy reading Fitzgerald, but I just couldn't get into The Love of the Last Tycoon. I understand Fitzgerald died while writing this book, and it is a shame because it had much potential, but as it stands it is incomplete and quite frankly, it reads like a rough draft. Still, a good edition for Fitzgerald scholars. And it truly is a shame that he didn't get to finish it or even polish it up a bit."
3,Bears similarities to Gatsby,"Fitzgerald himself said that this book's closet comparison, from among all his other works, was The Great Gatsby, and that is definitely my impression as well. Although incomplete, it offers a lightness and (despite its ultimately tragic subject matter) a departure from the dragging depression found in some of his other works. The glimpse into 1930s Hollywood is fascinating, although the constant name-dropping does grow jarring."
4,Fitzgerald's talent shines through,"Writers are endlessly second-guessing their work habits, their ideas and their purpose. As a novelist myself, I found this work-in-progress comforting, because it showed that even the greatest writers struggle with ""The Process.""Fitzgerald's inherent talent shines through, despite the incomplete nature of the work. The notes and other addenda helped shape the story even further for me, leaving it perhaps more fascinating for the wonder of what Fitzgerald might have done had he not died so young.I have groused in the past about the release of several Hemingway books after his death, and none has come close to the feeling of this unfinished work, but I cannot dispute the value to the reader of seeing these words, these last words, of one of America's greatest novelists. I am happy I got the chance."
5,Each season is better than the last,Every characters gets better after each seasons. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
5,Better than I thought it would be!,This was way better than I expected! Really got me hooked. Can't wait for the next collection to come out! The phoenix lady rocks!
5,A TV Classic Takes Form,"In this volume of the cult classic, Dark Shadows started to find success by making its new supernatural elements more intricate. A missing corpse, a psychic investigator, seances, ghosts, and a touch of the absurd all help to create the best volume of the series to date. Diana Millay's Laura character takes center stage as the charming and single-minded supernatural creature with a wide array of powers that she takes great pleasure in using to get her own way. Surprisingly dark and creepy for daytime TV--no wonder it stood out amidst the other soaps."
5,Great find!,I found these last year to use for my keys and was happy to discover them for the rest of the family.
3,They've Lost the Essence of Dragonball,"As I see it, the essence of dragonball is ascension to higher levels of consciousness. This film simply lacked the creativity shown in other episodes and films. Watching a descendent of Goku transform to super saiyan for the first time in their life should be an event of epic proportion. In this movie it is nothing of the sort. My summary is this: simple plot, ok fight scenes, and a very weak illustration of ascending to super saiyan. It just shouldn't be that easy!"
1,terrible,this was whack well i was'nt really into gt as much as dbz this did'nt really have any action in it it was boring and short so if you don't have it don't get it it was trash.
2,Not too great,"This is not a great movie , it's not that action packed and all the z fighters are dead and thats what makes it the worst. I suggest renting this unless u want to collect all the dvds."
1,Rental...,I am sorry but this was a somewhat of a disappointment. I wasn't expecting much and i didn't even get that. What i kept wondering was: what happened to Goku jr parents and their parents?...and what happened to the goku jr and vegeta jr that we saw in the future at the end of dragonball GT that was from the future?...this show put more holes and unanswered questions than anything else. *sigh*. For a basic story it delivered its few minutes of entertainment.
4,Nice Accessory - 2004 Mercedes S430,"I bought this because my original gray leather shift knob was looking pretty worn. The new knob came with 3 different inserts for different diameter shift rods. Installation was super easy, but the 3 screws used to tighten down the knob are extremely tiny. Don't have too much coffee before you attempt to install. Lastly, the gold ring at the base of the knob is optional. I left mine on, but if you leave it off, it would look fine.The feel is excellent and the color is very nice. It has more black in it than the rest of my car's wood trim, but the match is close enough."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Saw meets Hostel in this entertaining, but painfully predictable film. Elisha Cuthbert is the difference between Captivity and the dozens of lame horror movies produced every year. Don't get me wrong, Captivity is full of gore and has a ridiculously stupid storyline, but it's not that bad, and Cuthbert is the reason. The veteran actress, best known as Kim Bauer and The Girl Next Door, is very methodical with every move she makes and that really manages to keep your attention. The maze of traps, moving walls, and pitfalls were also really cool, but outside of that and Cuthbert, Captivity is your typical gore fest, with zero character development, and a chilling story that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I liked it for the little things, but overall, there's nothing special here, just another lame horror movie, that happened to land the right star."
5,"Saw, Hostel, Captivity","Not as good as any of the Saw movies, better than Hostel 1, on a par with Hostel 2"
1,Predictable to say the least!!,"This movie is absolutely nothing. It left nothing to the imagination. Not only that, this movie isn't scary, nor is it horror, it is nothing more than a bland suspense thriller at best. A suspense thriller with very little thrills or chills, and certainly nothing that would leave you on the edge of your seat. Truthfully, they left a lot of holes in the story. I wished they would've explained to me why, or what motive, these men had for doing these things to these people. With that said, eveything else was just more of the same. In fact, anyone who has seen their fair share of suspense thrillers could've figured out the plot and about her cellmate early on in the film just as I did. My sypnosis is that you rent this movie if you have nothing else better to do for about an hour and a half, but please DON'T! buy this because you'll have wasted your money if you do."
1,Horrible Film,"After reading all the other reviews and just finishing watching the movie myself, I would have to agree with the people who thought they wasted and hour and a half. This was by far one of the worst movies of the year. The actress was hot, but the plot sucked. Saw and Hostile were ten times better. This movie is pointless. Their is a common pattern within the movie that made me want to kill myself. Don't waste your money even renting it."
2,"Poorly edited, poorly written, pointless movie","This movie is garbage. You can tell they did reshoots, presumably to improve the movie, because Elisha Cuthbert's hair randomly alternates between her hair and a really bad wig. The reshoots did not improve the movie, but leave me wondering how much worse was it before if this is better? Pruitt Taylor Vince is in it. If you don't know his name, he's the fat guy that jiggles his eyes in everything he's ever been in. I guess some casting director thinks that's a good thing for horror movies. It actually was effective the first time he did it, but come on, come up with something new. He does the eye jiggle in EVERYTHING. It was over used by the time he was cast in Constantine and I'm totally over it by the time he shows up in this movie."
4,held captive... at least a little,"Captivity is both an overdone bloodfest, and a tastefully conceived dramatic psychoplay. If you hate the former, focus on the latter, because when you do, this movie plays out quite well. The feeling of Elisha's character being already held captive by an adoring public and ridiculous ideals set by an anorexically unhealthy modeling industry and public expectationsis well portrayed. The bond she forms with another captive prisoner is plausible and even understandable in this horrifying predicament. Unfortunately, the plot twists are forseen far, far before the director decides to alert us, and the bloody nasty array of torture and psychological bombardment by the captors is unnecessarily brutal. Still, these faults aside, Captivity is a worthy watch if just to see how it turns out. Like the accident on the side of the road, you dont want to look, but you just cant look away either... you're held in.... Captivity. 3.75 stars"
2,More of the same ............,"Here we go again...we know what will happen, these films are startingto all look alike...bad people killing their victims...lots of crying..blah blah blah. I guess films like this are still being made cause therea audience for it..."
4,WAS I WATCHING THE SAME MOVIE?,"Please check this out for yourself by renting it. I can't believe how many bad reviews this got. What do people want from horror these days?Seriously, this film will freak you out. If you even liked Hostel or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, do yourself a favor and check this out.It's not the best of it's genre but it is very good to me, and I'm pretty picky about my horror flicks."
2,Don't bother,"Its a sure sign that a film doesn't work for me when not once during this film was I scared. Sure during one of the torture scenes I wanted to look away, but that wasn't fear, more disgust at the nature of the events going on. Really I can't see much point to a film like this. You see it once, for the 'thrill', and then in my case I've vowed never to watch it again. In that respect its a bit like Hostel except not as good (and Hostel was not that good itself).The plot was fairly predictable, the acting ok and the music a rip-off of the Halloween theme. All rather pointless in my view. Furthermore to call it torture porn (whatever that means) is really over the top. Elisha Cuthbert is a great looking actress, but apart from one non-torture scene her dignity remains intact during the film.In summary I would say don't buy unless very cheap, because its not scary, and overall I would say it really isn't worth watching at all."
2,Nothing special,"This movie was't all that, It had some very creepy scences, but I just was to blah. Nothing really origianl."
4,"Great price, great knives","I bought my knife set about a year ago. I still love these knives! Can't go wrong for the price. Plus, they are still very sharp."
2,"Henkels' ""Everedge"" 13 knife set","Although the price was great, the quality of the knives is not what I expected. They do not cut in a straight line, for example, through fruits and vegetables they have a tendency to deflect towards the serrated edge of the knife. You have to work at trying to cut the item straight. In hindsight, I would have gone with the more expensive version or another ""non serrated"" version"
2,Cheap knives worthy of Walmart,"These are very basic, very cheap serrated knives. They do the job, but not well. Having a cheap set of steak knives is fine, but I'd gladly trade the rest of the set for one decent chef's knife. Don't be fooled by the name brand, this set is a Ford Pinto."
3,Idaho Mom,"Although this product isn't what I had expected, it is ok. I had always heard Henckels knives were one of the best. So, I wanted to give them a try. The main thing I don't like about them is their weight, very light weight so you feel like they might break if you put pressure on them. I wasn't aware of the different lines of Henckel so that was my error in not investigating further. However, the knives work nicely, but just not want I had expected."
1,Disappointed in quality,"Order received yesterday, I'm returning them today.Quality very poor and the knives don't look like the photo. Blades of the knives are more narrow, and the handles as so flimsy I doubt they'd last a month of light usage in the kitchen. I've bought J.A. Henkels International products before and was always very satisfied. What a disappointment! These are nothing like their description or stated quality."
3,"Well, they cut! Thats about the only praise I can give!","I already had Henkel knives. (My orig. set was much more expensive!) I guess these will do the job, but they are very lightweight and do not feel quality. You get what you pay for! I didn't pay much for these and I 'm not returning them, but I wish I had ordered something just a little nicer. The block is small, perfect for a small kitchen. I expect to be ordering new knives in a few years."
2,Poor quality - low price,"These knives are not your typical Henkels knives. They combine a fairly decent cutting edge with a terrible quality handle. The plastic handles have not been finished well, and there are obvious marks of the plastic molding all over it. The bonus cheese knife is a nice extra, if only it fit in the knife block... A real oversight.These knives go on sale quite a lot, when you can get them for $27 they are a good way of getting a set of Henkels knives on your kitchen counter. Anything over this price is simply a waste of money."
5,Best set of knives for the price!,"I bought these knives for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day. I love them! My own set of knives is the Henckels set from Costco. They are always needing sharpening, and even then I can't get them sharp like these ones are. I wish I could trade mine in!I think these are a much better value, and include more knives that I would actually use. They don't look as nice, but they get the job done."
3,Henckels low end knives,"WOW, I have purchased Henckel knives by themselves and got great knives with sturdy handles that will last forever. Like others, I bought this set thinking it would be somewhat close to the ones I have, but NO! The handles are disappointing, but I had read they were poly. No rivits to hold the blades in the handle, SO I hope the handle and blade stay together. I will go back to buying these knives seperately as before and will make sure I get the GOOD ONES this time. But, as they say, ""you get what you paid for and at 40.00 there pretty good."
5,this knife set is great!,"This knife set is great! It is a good deal for the money, and am very satisfied with it."
4,Not a fan of serrated knives,"I've had this knife set for more than 2 years, and they've been pretty good. They aren't quite as sharp as they used to be, though you can still cut (by tearing), since they're serrated.I didn't realize these were serrated - I just saw that they were Henckels and on sale. Next time, read the description carefully.Most of the people who have used these knives haven't been really impressed with them. Unlike unserrated knives, these require a slight sawing motion to cut; it makes a mess of slicing tomatoes. It's very difficult to sharpen serrated knives, so you'll have to get it done by a professional.If I'd known that these were serrated, I wouldn't have bought them so I could save my money for a real Henckels set.Also, the additional cheese knife doesn't fit into the block, so some knife has to go in a drawer."
2,Not For the Professional Cook,Henckels are well known for their use by culinary art professionals. Because of the name alone we purchased this set for a working chef. Unfortunately the price alone should have warned us. This set is not up to the standards for chefs who use thicker blades and use knives that can stand up to sharpening and over use. We are keeping them and will probably save them to give as a wedding gift. They are a good set for Home use.
1,Didn't realize Henckels could produce such poor quality,"This set of knives is of inferior quality, and I am surprised that they bear the Henckels name. I regret making this purchase of such a poor set of knives. I would have done better to buy one or two knives of decent quality."
3,Very Basic,"The knives arrived quickly. These are the most basic knives you can get and are really nothing special. I got them because I had just moved and didn't have any knives at all. Ever try to cut raw chicken with a dinner steak knife? It's not pretty, but is pretty much the same as using one of these. These are okay for the price and good when you have nothing at all. I suggest, however, that if you are not desperate and just need a few good knives, go to Wal-Mart or Target. You can do better."
3,decent if you can get them on sale,"I bought this set in 2002 so I thought I'd give my opinion after 7 years of use.Theses knives have been great but now they are feeling a bit worn. We use the 8"" chef's knife and 5"" steak knives almost daily.Here's the negative: I've started reading about knives and the main thing I've learned is that the best knives are those that you can sharpen. You cannot sharpen these knives because the serrations are too fine. The next knife set will be mostly non-serrated.In summary, for an entry-level knife set these are perfect. Try to pick these up for around $25 if you can."
1,dissapointed,Not what I thought it would be. Pretty useless set of knives. I've purchased Henckels knives in the past. This set is obviously the bottom of their line. They will be sold in my next yard sale for a dollar. I regret the purchase. Too late to return it all since the box and paperwork was disposed of long ago... drat!
2,not recommend......,well known band name but low quality. srongly suggest NOT buying this product for eastern style cooking.Giving 2 stars because these knifes are great for fruits and vegetables but really sucks for meat!!!!!!!
3,Henckels International Everedge,"Nice set for the price. I have cut myself more with these knives then any others I own. The everedge does not make for a smooth cutting motion but instead the edge catches and then releases and you don't really know when. I would buy the set again if I could not afford a better set. The steak knives are a great add on. My set did not come with them but a set of silverwear I bought,they came as a bonus. I bought two sets so I got 10 steak knives and I love them.Cutting cooked steak is not as dangerous has cutting uncooked. The knife's I cut myself the most with are the bread and chefs knife'."
2,sub par knives,This set of knives would be ideal for a college student or new person on their first apartment. They are not really Henckel quality. Good value for anyone that is not a real cook. Real cooks should look elsewhere.
4,Nice knives,"Although these are pretty lightweight and not in the ""Chef or Serious Cook"" category they work just fine for me. The blades are sharp and precise enough to slice most day-to-day things well. I still keep my old heavyweight big knife handy for tough jobs such as dealing with watermelons, frozen foods, etc. For me, it's a worthwhile trade-off, as at $50, the price is right!"
3,I expected more from Henckels,The knives are good by all means for the price I paid. But disapointed in overall quality that Henckels is known for.
1,Henckle Knife block set,I was not impressed with the handles of this set. The blade did not run throughout the handle and they were very light in weight. I was impressed with the sharpness however. All the knives were serrated which could not be sharpened. The Sabatiar set I purchased at Amazon had much better handles - a sharpener instrument and scissors and very nice handles --- but they are not sharp.
2,Not for me,"If you don't use your knives often, this might be an ok deal...some people just dont care. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest these knives. They are too flimsy, the handles are made of cheap plastic and they are serrated. It would be worth it to spend a little more and get something with better quality handles, better steel, and non-serrated edges. These knives are not up to the standard of Henckels knives, or Japanese stainless(where they are made)."
4,Great For The Price,"I have had these knives for over a year and of all the knives I have owned they are the best. They may not compare to the high-end knives made by this brand, but they are great for the typical family. I am very very satisfied with them!"
1,I should have read the reviews before purchasing this item!!,Not worth it.... I bought this item for my sister and she hated it... Ended up getting a kitchen aid set
1,Dont fall for it,This product is a ripoff for the money. Henckels is abusing people's trust in the brand by foisting a lousy product like this.Buy this product and Iam sure you will never look at a Henckels knife again in your life. (I bought a Wushtof instead)
3,Henckels International Everedge 13-Piece Knife Set with Bonus Cheese Knife,"I should have done a little more research with the knives. They are nice, just not exactly what I was needing."
1,Made in China,"Although i have not purchased this set, i will tell you that any 13 piece knife set from Henckels for under $40 is definately made in china, which basically means it sucks. Although they may be fine bang for your buck, if you really want quality then buy a set made in Germany. Brands like Henckels and Wusthoff are exceptional knives made in Germany however they have factories in china which make cheaper knives with far inferrior quality but still bare the prestigious name. Just a thought, cheers."
1,Junk,"Received this knife set less than two weeks ago. The ""Bonus Cheese Knife"" which I was using for cheese, has already broken. The light-weight plastic handles are small, the knives are small. It's just a junky knife set. Not worth $20."
2,J. A. Henckel knive set,"Unfortunately, I have some Henckel products that date back to the nineteen twenties (beautiful scissors) and some to the nineteen forties (knives). I don't think these can compare and they come with so many instructions: how to clean, how to use. I really haven't used them yet. I wish they were still made in Germany.Mallory Semple"
3,Better than most,"These knives are better than most but not the top of the line for Henckels. The stainless blade does not go through the whole handle but for the price, a good value."
5,Henckels Knives,I was somewhat surprised to find them so reasonably priced on amazon. I was really amazed when I got them and found they were the same high quality as the stores and for a much better price. Thank you amazon
2,Henckels Everedge Knives,I did not feel this product repersented the well known Henckelsquality. I would not purchase again.I have several older Henckels I love.
3,Oversized slots on block,"The knives are nice and very very sharp. The handles feel cheap, but so far so good after about a month. My complaint is the slots in the block are all large. It looks so strange putting a smaller knife into such a wide slot. I don't know if I received an odd block by mistake, or if it is just a general block with large slots. It doesn't cause any kind of problem other than to me it looks weird. All knife sets I have owned before had different sized slots for the different sizes of knives."
4,knife set was gift but is liked,"I purchased this knife set as a Christmas gift for my son's girlfriend, but she seems to be happy with them. She was especially excited to try out the different blades that she had never previously used (filet knife for example). The steak knives were the best part as far as they were concerned. Hopefully they will continue to be pleased with this product."
3,good starter set,"Got this for my son as a starter set. Very excited to see the Henckel knives so cheap. Handles are plastic, which I think looks cheaper but will not effect the cut, and not bad soaking or in the dishwasher. The blades are what they call ""ever sharp"" and are deadly sharp and won't need a sharpener."
3,Kitchanman,I took a look at my knives the other day and tried to remember which of the women I've been with left me with those. So I decided to buy my own set of knives to go with my completely rearranged kitchen. I chose these based on reviews I read here and have not been disappointed. The knife selection is good and the set is worth the price just for the steak knives alone. The only thing I have against the set is the chef's knife it needs to be offset to be effective in chopping and dicing vegetables. I will be replacing that with a better one soon.
1,Henckels should be Ashamed,This product does not live up to Henckels reputation. The quality is inferior and completely not what I expected. The knives are unbalanced and flimsy. The handles are too small to provide adequate support for the blade.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE KNIVES - EXTREMELY CHEAP,"These knives are of a very cheap quality. You are better of buying one nice chefs knife and one pairing knife. Try Wüsthof, Global or Shun, you will not regret. A good well taken care of knife will last you a lifetime. Don't waste your money on a set with the quality you'd expect to find at a 99 cent store. The Wüsthof Classic 2-Piece Knife Starter Set can be found around $99. A little more money but a much better bang for your buck in the end."
2,A disappointment ...,I've had these knives for maybe 3 weeks now and was excited to finally get them after waiting through delayed shipping. They are cheesy feeling with light weight plastic handles and they are showing rust spots on the blades after just a few trips through the dishwasher. They are nice and sharp but overall I am very disappointed with these.
3,Ginsu of the J.A. Henkles knives,"I personally don't care for the everedge blades. I am a bit old fashioned. They cut well (I sliced my hand open and got four stiches, within a week of owning them) But I prefer Chicago Cutlery."
3,so far okay,So far so good. The knives arrived extremely sharp and so far are in fair shape (2 months). Not too sure if the serrated end on the chef knife is going to hold up to serious use (Meats thrice a week) though. A few edges may have begun to bend.But all in all I like them. The balance is pretty good and for under thirty dollars you can complain...well too much.Cheers and happy cooking.
1,Didn't Henckel have a Good Reputation?,"I was very unhappy with these knives. I expected smooth-edged sharpenable knives that keep their sharpness well. These are all serrated. Every one! They are no better than those knives you see on TV that demonstrate their sharpness by cutting through an aluminum can. Not that difficult or impressive a feat with a new serrated edge knife (try it yourself!). All hype, no quality. Even the wooden block was poorly constructed."
2,Cheap Quality,"Sure the name says Henckels, but the quality does not. The knives are serrated and they do a terrible job of cutting things like chicken. You get what you pay for I suppose."
5,Knives,"I ordered this J.A. Henckels International Everedge knife set from Amazon and the entire experience was top notch.I received an excellant product,easy check-out,prompt delivery and my order was easy to track.I have ordered from Amazon in the past and and I would give this site a five star rating.Well done !"
3,It was just okay.,It was just okay. It didn't follow the Tillermans as much as the other books in the series. I really enjoyed the first 2 books of the series.
3,A Solitary Blue---It's worth reading once.,"I gave this book three stars. It is not the greatest book that I have read, but everyone should read it at least once. It is basically about a family that has broken up, and the boy lives with his father. His father doesn't show his feelings very well, and the mother only began to when she heard about the boy's sickness. Jeff goes to visit his mother during summer break, when he is with her, he feels what it is like to be loved. The author does a great job at expressing the boy's feelings. The boy, Jeff, is deeply depressed, partly because of having no friends, partly because his family didn't show much love for him until later in his life. This book shows how someone's life can be happy and sad."
5,Touching. Something you will keep on coming back to.,"I read a few of Cynthia Voight's book and this is one of her best works. You see Jeff, how he loves his mother, then she just broke his heart which left him in a deep depression. You finally see him come out of his shell. This book has numerous meaning. I loved every bit of it. I couldn't put it down. I encourage you all to read it, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Good read,"Good read; very complex, but not as good as Dicey's Song, which was nearly a masterpiece. By the way the Tillermans don't show up until the last third of the book!"
3,This book is for readers who like predictability.,"A Solitary Blue is the story of Jeff Greene from the Tillerman family stories. This book begins with Jeff as a child. As he grows up, he faces many problems. Though it is well written, it lacks the power to hold the reader's interest. It is very predictable, and there are many times when there isn't a great deal of action. It is almost a biography, and it goes through the stages of Jeff's life without much happening. It is rather boring when compared to the first book, Homecoming. In Homecoming the children were always in the middle of an adventure while Jeff basically grew up without any thrills in his life. Although the book can be quite boring, it is still well written. It is very descriptive and helps the reader visualize what is happening. This story is very descriptive but has a hard time keeping the reader's interest."
3,"a deep interesting novel, and very well written.","The book was marvelous, a splendid piece by a compromising author. Pick this book up right away."
4,This book was very well written.,"Jeff Greene, the main character in this book, has to deal with many problems in his life. When he meets Dicey Tillerman and her family, his problems seem to just melt away. This beautifully written book by Cynthia Voight has many meanings. It also can reach inside and pull out your emotions. Her books have a special meaning about love or unity. The imagery makes the reader a part of the story as a character. In the end, Dicey and Jeff grow closer together, and he feels like he is united with a real family."
2,Where are the Tellermans?,I really enjoyed the first two books in the series. I started reading the third book and the Tellerman's aren't in the book. It's dissapointing considering that's why I bought the book. I don't know how this book can be considered part of the series. I liked the Tellerman kids.
1,ATTENTION INSOMNIACS !! THIS BOOK WILL DO THE TRICK.,"Whne I was younger (3rd,4th,5th grade) my mother would read a chapter of a book to me every night before I went to bed. When we picked Solitary Blue and settled into or normal routine, we were horrified. This deathly boring book drew my mother and I into deep slumber. Both of us are avid and articulate readers who are usually appreciative of all styles, but this book was bad, and I mean BAD. Maybe I was too young to appreciate this moaning boy and Cynthia Voight's drawn out, meandering and POINTLESS plot. But years later after tryin again, I still couldn't get past the 3/4 mark."
3,A book that has a lot to offer for teenagers,I read this book and in the first part of the book it was pretty good and I really liked it. I would say in the middle to end it dragged on. I thought it had a lot of extra writing that shouldn't have been it. I do think it is a good book if you don't concentrate on deatails and look for the overall theme.
4,OK but could be better,"I think that it's just Cynthia Voigt's way of writing. It good,though because she's my favorite author. Some parts were really boring and some were really exciting. I put myself in Jeff's place, and how his mother really hurt him, it seemed like it was about Ms.Voigt's real life. I was a wonderful book, though."
5,You definitely want 2 get around 2 reading this book,This book was a very good book. In this book you could not figure out what was going to happen at the end and when the end unfortunatly comes around you are suprised at what happens. Some of the characters even change their personality just like in the real world or even how Jeff looks at them. It was a really good book. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.
4,The characters will touch you deeply.,"This book was a terrific book. The characters Ms. Voight has created are so strong. The main character has gone through so much in his life that he has become strengthened. This book is filled with love, hate, and forgiveness."
2,An Easy Read,"I recently bought and read this book and thought the book was alright. It was easy to read and did not require any deep thought. I found that it WAS quite predictable. You were able to guess exactly what was going to happen and you KNEW that there was going to be a happy ending no matter what.I think that a little more conflict or more to the plot would have made this book a bit more of a challenge and a little bit more entertaining. I enjoy books where the main characters have more spunk. However, it was a fairly decent book that managed to keep my attention."
5,devoted fan,I love those Kazanov brothers these books are great anyone reading this will fall in love with them the same way I have this book is funny I enjoyed the characters and the story you go Patricia Grasso
5,Very series related. . . . .,"and that may be the only bad thing about this book. This is my second Grasso book, the first I read was Pleasuring the Prince, which I really did not enjoy becuase of the childish heroine, but even in this book the heorine from PtP was very pleasant.I thought this story was fantastic, the hero and heroine both had my heart. They had a great strength together and apart, and were qutie funny together, I had a good time laughing with this book. I may try and feed someone a spider sandwich myself. I think it was quite sweet how the hero worked his way to get the woman he loved and she had the strength to work through her fears, and the spitefulnes of others. The little girls from other characters were so adorable.I can't wait to read more about these families, have already ordered the rest of the Kazanov, Flambeau and Douglas series. I'm hoping PtP was just a fluke."
1,Do not order this product!,"Do not order this product! What is pictured does not match the product code and you will not get what you think you are ordering! You will get a basic rechargeable toothbrush in hot pink! I wish I had read all the reviews before I ordered this because I was not the first person to have this problem.I was able to return the product because I had not opened it but World Wide Sales denied that they were in any way at fault, and withheld the shipping and a restocking fee even though they promised me a full refund."
5,"Warm, loveable, brings nice cozy images to mind","This wonderful book is full of neat ways to share a hug. Kids will enjoy the illustrations and the humor -- penguins with ""ice cube hugs"" and even ""report card hugs!"""
5,Great Book,"I seldom give 5 stars but this book is worth every star. It's one of those Mommy feel good books like ""Guess How Much I Love You"". It's not hopelessly sappy either. It will make you smile, laugh and want to hug anyone is nearby."
4,Very Cute Book,"My 17 month old daughter really likes the book. At first, when I read the introduction, she was a little bored, but by the end of the book, she was hugging her stuffed animal to show me how SHE hugs."
5,henckels brand with Global design.,Henckels have done a great job with this. The knife storage block along with the overall design is similar to the well known japanese knife brand named Global.what I like about this is that it shows that Henckels have caught on to customers needs and wants. It has developed a very modern design and incorporated it into their superbe quality knives to give you the ultimate in design and craftsmanship.For the price you get Global looks with Henckel quality and reputation what more can you ask for?
3,Sharp knife at first but...,"I bought this set about 6 months ago and it was sharp and well balanced. Recently I notice that the blade was chipping off and started to get dull, I don't know if this is a flaw or time to get it resharpened. I took very good care of it and never put it in the dishwasher. Overall its a good knife that probably needs sharping done on it every 6 months."
4,Animal Attraction,"A fun book, though i liked the first book ""The Animal in You"" better. This was a little more descritptive than the first book. Either way both books are fun to try out on your friends or co-workers, just 2 see how u mesh. Funny thing is that the animal you are is pretty much who you are, if you are honest while taking the test."
3,Isle of Palms,"Not my favorite book of Dorthea's. I stuggled to finish it as it sort of drug on. Not a believable story, but entertaining anyway."
4,Fun read - just don't get caught up in the details,"Not Dottie's best, but a fun read anyway. Not exactly believable circumstances or characters. Just read it for entertainment."
2,"Unfortuately, disappointing","Having read Plantation, I was looking forward to this book, but I have to say I agree with the reader from Charlottesville. This story is largely unbelievable, mostly because the author didn't develop her characters enough. What was the point of Grandmother Violet even being in the book? She was supposed to be a real b----, but I only got the sense of a cardboard figure.And Lucy, who is portrayed as a real ditz, conveniently enough has sold a bundle of stock right before the market dropped (!). Huh?! And just loans a boodle to Anna, the narrator, so she can open up a salon. That just strained credulity for me.It's a rapid read, and I read the whole thing, but there is just too much deus ex machina. I liked the narrator, Anna Abbott; I just wish the characters were more developed and the plot less fantastic."
5,"Big, bold, bright, and charming!","Isle of Palms features a smart and appealing heroine and a story that doesn't quit. Author Frank manages her plot and her characters with grace, authority, and good humor. Reading Isle of Palms is like spending an evening with best friends -- very entertaining and very satisfying."
3,A Good Read!,"ISLE OF PALMS is, very simply, a good read.After completing this novel, one might conclude that the precipitating event seems implausible, that the ending is too tidy and too happy.And, while in the midst of the book, some of the dialogue seems stilted, more likes speeches than like normal speech.All of these considerations are quibbles, however.The sense of place is strong in this book, so strong that the reader can smell the ocean off the barrier island of North Carolina which has its name used as this title. In fact, by the end of the book, one is ready to pack up and move to the ISLE OF PALMS.In ISLE OF PALMS, Dorothea Benton Frank has authored a compelling and engaging story, a story which will engross the reader from the first page to the last."
1,ISLE OF PALMS: A LOWCOUNTRY TALE,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! ONLY A FEW PLACES DID I SEE THE GREAT CHARACTERS THAT SHE PRESENTED IN HER FIRST TWO BOOKS. I HOPE HER NEXT ONE IS BETTER.
5,A Low Country Pleasure,"Hello-she's baaaaaaaack- that low country lovin, livin, writin, Dorothea Benton Frank.As with her previous 2 releases, ISLE OF PALMS, is also set in the author's beloved birthplace region and is a tribute to everything from it's salty marshes to it's eccentric inhabitants.IOP is the author's best book yet.Frank provides equal parts drama, southern heritage and razor sharp one liners(reminiscent of Jersey girl, Evanovich).The character of Anna Lutz Abbot is richly layered and supported by an ensemble cast that is flawed,but,loving and loyal.Anna's narrative is truly southern as well as sassy!After reading all 3 of Frank's books, I have added a much needed, soul feeding, low country visit to my 'things to do before I die list.'The 2 days spent reading this book was a long over due treat and well worth the wait since PLANTATION. My only regret is I didn't have my feet and backside firmly planted in the sandy beaches of South Carolina while reading it!"
5,Isle of Palms by Dot Frank,"This was a wonderful read! Having taken yearly vacations to Isle of Palms this book transported me back to the Island with each page. This book had great humor, the people in here were real, the locations described are places I have walked and seen. I highly recommend this book."
2,Falling Apart at the Seams,"After a slightly corny start, the novel proceeds to draw the reader in to an authentic world with vivid characters. (I have spent part of every summer on this island for the past 20 years.)I couldn't put it down...until about 3/4's of the way through, when it completely fell apart. It became tedious,boring,and predictable, as if the author herself had gotten tired of the project and wanted nothing more than to hasten its end. Certain themes were never resolved; others were rushed to an early,trite conclusion.It's sad, because she really had something good going for a while."
4,Love Dorothea Benton Frank,"I won't summarize the plot -- others have already done that. This is a ""feel good book."" None of the main characters dies (well, other than mama and we didn't know her) and the ending leaves you smiling. That's my kind of book. Why people need books that wallow in tragedy is beyond me. Real life is tragic enough. And, although the main characters have challenges to overcome, they triumph.When I escape in books, I want to go somewhere I enjoy. DBF's books make you want to be there, living next door, and spending time with the women in these stories. Some are better than others, but I recommend them all."
3,Pants,"The pants fit well, except that I was sent a size that is too long, and I was sent the wrong type of pants. They are really dark blue below the knees which is not very attractive, and the have big brown paint spots on the butt which look like poop. The price tag they came with said $160.00, but I think that is a thilthy lie."
3,Useful globetrotter,"I bought this inverter to use my laptop/phone charger/GPS in my truck. It works really well as described. Three things:- Be prepared in case of overheating the inverter automatically shuts off(computer, saving data).- There is a processor checking the car/truck battery level and when it becomes too low for the next start, turns the device off. Sounds good but can be wrong(don't turns off in time!). Use this feature with caution, experience the consumption of your devices and the battery power- find the balance. The safest thing is still the running engine!- The two sockets are too close together. A wide phone charger blocks the other one.I've been using mine since 3 years without any problem."
1,Bad ...,No clear instructions or numbers to bulid it just you need to look at the pictureNeed for sandingThe need for glue
1,Not for jazz Fans........but Funk & Soul fans,This is similar to the type of Funk LP's that Maceo Parker has been making in the last few years. Les Sings on this CD but only makes one appearance on keyboards (where he sings over one of his 1960's piano trio tracks)The rest of the keyboard duties are taken by others. If your a fan of his Jazz LP's (Like me I have over 60 of them)then this isnt for you. For 90's Soul & Funk fans only. I have star rated this with its jazz contents in mind only.
1,it is not sterling silver,this necklace is not sterling silver i cant find 925 on it ne where it feels like something that came from a bubble gum machine the key bends easily and will soon just break its more like plastic than silver it was a good fraud for 30 bucks u got me once u will not do it again!!!!!!!!!amanda payne
2,"Attractive, but not functional.","The key is designed wonderfully, but, sadly, its construction doesn't hold up so well... very prone to bending and (eventually) breaking. I'll be looking for a sturdier replacement."
2,Poor,"it looks big and strong in a picture but Unfortunately, after few weeks from buying it became broken"
3,Inadequate for HDTV reception,"I got this for $20 at VideoOnly. In Portland, Oregon, it receives some of the HD channels (2.1, 6.1, 8.1, 8.2, 10.1, 10.2) ok but not great; some reception (12.1) is pretty poor (frequent blocking artefact and loss of signal). For the Olympics on 8.1, we have blocking artefact about once per 10 minutes.This is most likely a problem with non-directionality, and inability to reject multipath signals. I would recommend a directional uhf antenna for HD instead (eg, Zenith ZHDTV1).For non-HD: the construction is quite good (doesn't feel cheap), and my wife likes the looks (this is rare, for technical items)."
2,Latter-Day Night Biscuit,Expecting a good follow-on to It's Latter-Day Night Live Comedy I was sadly disappointed. My family and I set through the entire comedy monolog with the hope that it would get better. Sadly it did not. Save your money!
2,NOT water resistant,"I got this watch for my fiance last Christmas. The first time it got wet, the inside of the face got cloudy with condensation. After this happened a few times, I sent it back to the company to be repaired. After several weeks and several emails, I finally got it back, only to do the same thing again. If you plan to wear this near water, buy something else."
1,a joke,"Go for Arsenal of Megadeth, you'll be much happier. ok, the more expensive 2 DVD set doesn't have ""Crush 'Em"", but neither does this DVD."
1,Horrible - gone in 15 minutes..,well not much to say about this worthless garbage. My dog chew thru the ball in about 15 minutes after I gave the toy to her. My only hope is it wasn't toxic.
5,John Rutter Collection,Absolutely beautiful selections performed perfectly!! I play it almost daily and repeatedly. I am familiar with several pieces from a performance perspective and enjoy the entire collection immensely.
2,Not Worth $29,"I bought this game for my nine year old son because he loves working with money and loves the game Monopoly. He likes this game, but I found it a little long and boring. If you wheel and deal and negotiate side deals, you can make it more fun. The first time we played it was just the two of us, and it was not fun and the bank ran out of money. We played again with four people and it was a better game. I was diappointed in the quality of the game board and markers, and think it is quite over-priced at $29."
2,not quite what I was looking for,"My favorite game is Acquire. I can't find a copy available, so I bought ""So Sue Me"" in the mean time. Mainly I have a lack of affinity with the general attitude necessary to play it. Also I found myself at a point hoping to lose the game already, so we could end playing and go do something else."
1,one of the worst games ever.,"dont buy this!. save your money for some other game. this game has [poor] graphics, almost impossible controls, and is boring. the only difference between pitchers is their color and either red or blue uniform. all pitchers have the same pitches. baseball is my fav sport and this game almost made me hate it."
3,Borrow it from the library,"Like someone else said, the back cover is a lie - there are no maps. Basically I borrowed this book from the library because of the first 50 pages which contain interviews with Weis & Hickman. This is really interesting stuff, covering :- their backgrounds- how they got to TSR- how the whole DragonLance project started- how they got chosen to write the books and the incredibly short time frames they had - they wrote the first DragonLance book in under 2 months!My advice, read this section, forget the rest. It ain't worth buying but definitely worth borrowing."
3,It's OK,"I always loved the classic Herbacin hand cream. However, I bought this one this time to try it out. I was a bit disappointed as it's not as good as the classic one. The classic one is very moisturizing and makes your hands really soft. This one is less so."
1,Word to the wise,"Chattem, the distributor of Garlique, states on their website that the garlic powder used in Garlique is imported from China, it may or may not be organic (they're not sure), and they know little about how it is processed.If you find this hard to believe, you can read it for yourself by going to the Chattem site, choosing Health & Wellness, Garlique, then click on the Garlique image, and finally select FAQ in the left side. Scroll down the page to the question about where the garlic comes from and whether it's organic. Their answer is startling."
3,standard cheep Chinese gearbox w/ motors.,"It comes in a kit. It does what it is supposed to. The gear ratio is either super fast or, if you assemble it in the other configuration, it is super slow. No happy middle. Probably better off getting the more expensive one with more than two gear configurations."
1,An interesting point of view,"William Lambers puts forth a relatively well thought out argument for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. However, in my opinion, contrary to the title, he does not present a valid argument for superiority of the test ban treaty as ""A better shield than missile defense"". As in his book ""Nuclear Weapons"" (ISBN 0965652076), the font is large and a portion of the book is given over to reproduction of other articles.All in all, not really worth even the small price."
4,Recommended,This is a great summer book. It carries you along and makes you think a bit too. I passed my copy on to my mother and you might do the same! Its a relatively light hearted journey of discovery that you want to share.
2,"Too much griping, ending too pat","I wanted to like this book, but I found the main character, Charlotte, to be whiny and boring. Instead of taking control and trying to change the things she didn't like about her life, she just complained about them. Each chapter began with a long, drawn out memory of some awful experience related to the debut of one of her books. I found myself liking her sister, Emily, much better than I liked Charlotte, which was unfortunate for a book told in the first-person. Then, after I spent 90% of the book waiting for Charlotte to just get on with things, the author wrapped it all up in a nice, tidy little package - only slightly longer and with slightly more details than ""and they all lived happily ever after."" It was a disappointing read - I'm glad I got it from the library and was just as happy to give it back."
2,"An easy read, but I would not recommend it...","While this plot of book was charming in its own way, I'd have to admit that I was greatly disappointed by the story itself. The author made teaching in a public school seem like an undesirable profession and that in the end, anyone could do it (as long as they put on ""frumpy"" clothes and took on a Martha Stewart-type persona). It does not seem like the author has ever had any classroom experience because her portrayal of this profession was both unrealistic and stereotypical. I would not recommend this book to anyone in the field of education."
2,Electric clock,"I was disappointed in this clock because I didn't realize that it can only be used with a recessed electrical receptacle. I have a flat receptacle, so the clock will not sit properly on the wall. Also the plastic looks cheap. However, I liked the clarity of the numbers."
3,"Fun, but it is what it is.","My son truly enjoys the crane. It comes with some additional items, including a dump truck, a front end loader, and some other ""construction"" items. The crane itself operates with three levers allowing it to turn automatically 180 degrees... although we have made it go further.The cable also move along the length of the crane, and up and down using the same levers. It does provide some entertainment....But, the most disappointing aspect of the CCW is that it is constructed pretty flimsily. The plastic parts feel like they could snap in an instant. The platform rest on a plastic base and only needs a nudge to slide off of it.With that said, both my boys enjoy it despite my issues with it. If you are going to purchase the CCW, just accept that it is what it is."
2,Cheap version of a Mac Computer,"A linux that tries to look like Windows, save your money and buy a real MAC."
1,Not much food for thought here,"Do not get me wrong. I am NOT saying that this book is fatuous. I am NOT saying that it is poorly written. I am NOT saying that its author does not know his Theology. What I am saying is that I read it expecting to learn something new, approaching it as a left-brain dogmatic treatise of some sort, packed with History, Philosophy, Theology, Hermeneutics. To my disappointment, it was nothing of that sort. What I read instead, was a right-brain, artistic book, fluffy, lofty and sentimental. With all due respect to the author, this is not what I had expected when I picked it up. I am willing to concede, though, there is a time and a place to write theology books from an aesthetical perspective. This one did not do it for me, sorry."
5,Beautiful knives,I spent the money and I love them. I read reviews about the handles being too bulky for those with small hands but I have had no problem with them and I do have small hands!
3,"Many good ideas, but....","This book contains many good ideas and touches a wide range of areas of mathematics. However, it needs better editing. In some cases, there are just omissions in directions, while in other cases they are unclear. Fortunately, you can easily look up what the author meant to say in wikipedia. Also, I found the personification of mathematical objects just plain weird.My suggestion is to request this book via interlibrary loan. I found several things in this book I can use with my children."
3,"It was okay, I thought.","Suprised to see such negative reactions. I thought all women in the Star Trek universe were a) gorgeous or b) in love with Spock, Kirk or McCoy.Anyhow, I found it a fairly readable entry into the original Star Trek book series. I like how it tackled the idea of intolerance (although it may feel a little bit dated now) and found the issue with the planet to fit well into the Trekkie universe.This was the first Trek entry of Kathleen Sky."
1,"Trite, idiotic sexual fantasies.","This book is the worst Star Trek novel that I have ever read.Kathleen Sky is obsessed with indulging in her adolescent sexualfantasies and subjecting the reader to her preoccupation with meaningless, imbecilic verbal exchanges between a very unprofessional Doctor McCoy and a childish Doctor Tremain. It is ridiculous that a woman who is supposed to be one of the great scientific brains of the galaxy exhibits the intelligence and maturity of a sorority girl who struggles to pass her sociology classes. Kathleen Sky should have written novels about teenage girls who spend their days trading gossip about the twerp actors and musicians covered in Tiger Beat magazine. ""Vulcan!"" is a joke and a waste of paper and ink. END"
2,Doesn't hold a candle to his Father's music....,"I really wanted to like this, but really couldn't w/exception for ""I Dream Pop Gigged w/Us"". ""I Don't Do the Things I Used To"" and ""ShellShocked"" are okay, I wouldn't consider this blues, though. Songs like ""Spit In My Mouth"", ""Will You Be My Wife"" and ""Hey Pretty Girl"" have no business being labeled even vaguely blues, they're rather quite silly songs and not enjoyable."
4,Good Reynolds Movie,"I remember seeing this on T.V. a couple of times. Filmed in Santa Rosa Ca. and know of some places where it was filmed. Very good Reynolds movie, kept you interested. Would love to see it on DVD."
3,Easily chewed,"My dog loved this toy since it has a few different textures. Unfortunately, the plastic circle part of it got chewed up pretty fast and I had to throw it away because of the chunks coming off. I wish it was more durable, because my dog was very upset when I took it away."
4,fantacy mystery romance,This book is similer to a stand alone that the charictors are not in the other books in the trilogy However there is one constant there is at least one charictor from the circle which is run by Seline and was set up in the series with nikki and michael its another good one definetly worth reading.
5,Fantastic,Keri Arthur is a fantastic writer. I have read all three of her books and would highly recommend them.
4,magnificent debut,"Ah, the heady days of misogyny. Or was it really misanthropy? Rattus is already archetypal Stranglers within the first minute, punk-ish but obviously a band who knew how to play and keep a tune going amid the attitude. There are three undeniable classics here - the sweaty ""Hanging Around"", the sneering pseudo-reggae ""Peaches"", and the stomping ""Grip"" - but plenty more besides. ""Sometimes"" propels itself along Dave Greenfield's organ (as it were), ""London Lady"" audibly drips with contempt, and ""Goodbye Toulouse"" manages to be a thumping, melancholy ballad. ""Down in the Sewer"" is a wondrous marriage of punk and prog rock, with a bit of Hank Marvin thrown in. The lyrics throughout the album are probably offensive at times but then if you're the sort of person who listens to the Stranglers you can probably handle it. It's all a bit tame by today's standards anyway. ""Ugly"" is, however, rubbish."
5,IT DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS,"The best studio album, from the best Band to come out of England ever. Forget the Beatles Stones etc. this is real English working class music from a very angry time in UK history.Buy it or stay listening to that wimpy American rock. We gave you The Stranglers,The Clash, The Jam. You gave us Kiss, Bon Jovi, Bob Seger heavens above do yourselves a favour listen to some real music you won't regret it promise. Cheers Pete-Manchester, England"
5,Improving communication in family or intimate relationships.,"Mental health professionals Gregory Boothroyd and Lori Boothroyd combine their experience in Going Home: A Positive Emotional Guide for Promoting Life-Generating Behaviors, a consumable self-help book written especially for those who struggle with themselves in the search for happiness in their life and relationships. Chapters discuss how self-sabotaging behaviors are learned, maintained, and implemented, how to identify harmful behaviors and replace negative thought patterns with positive focus. Applications for these helpful psychological techniques range from learning to disassociate from substance abuser behavior patterns to improving communication in family or intimate relationships."
1,not impressed,"I'm almost half way through my pregnancy, and I received this as a gift and look at it frequently. It's fun to have something to look at every day. It leaves me wishing for something better, though.I wish there were pictures, or at the very least drawings, of the growing babe. The constant warnings about gaining too much weight are lame! It's more dangerous to gain too little than to much, but I feel like every other day, there it is again - don't gain too much! (I haven't even gained any yet, so I'm not being defensive about this.)I agree with others who've said it isn't really a journal. There's almost no room to write anything.I wish it went by the more standard 40 weeks (starting with lpm), rather than 38 weeks starting with conception. It's confusing. I'm not crazy about the way it counts down to the estimate due date, either."
2,Entertaining ... but Inaccurate!,"While the idea of having a book to turn to every day of my pregnancy has been fun, I cannot rely on it for factual information on development and pregnancy recommendations. It's been off by more than a month on certain milestones and my doctor (and other books) disagree with much of the ""advice"".The ""childbirth in other cultures"" feature is especially interesting. However, I'm not yet ready for the parenting suggestions -- they seem misplaced.Enjoy it, but don't take it too seriously."
2,Inaccurate and confusing - buy a different calendar!,"Two frustrations with this book - (1) blatant inaccuracies about fetal development and (2) uses date from conception instead of LMP (which is used by everyone else in the entire pregnancy universe). I have had fun with the book, but take everything with a grain of salt. The author needs to brush up on her science!"
2,Not quite right,"I bought this journal at a bookstore and ended up returning it. The reason I returned it was because the journal dating is based on the date of conception NOT on the first day of your last period. What this means is that when you look in your journal and are reading and writing for week 7, you will actually be(according to the dating your doctor will be using)in your 9th week. I didn't like the confusion and would rather be in sync with the dating system that my doctor is using. It's too bad, because other than this one thing that was not quite right, I thought the journal was great."
4,Absolutely fabulous!,This journal is great! It's different than all others by giving you details on what's happening to your baby every day. It was very helpful to me and enjoyable. I loved the 'Did you know?' and the quote on every page. I highly recommend this journal to anyone who's expecting - it's a wonderful keepsake for you baby in the future.
4,Nice Date Book.,"This is a beautiful book, has a nice index in the back to find most information within the book.Essentially this is a date book letting you know what is happening to you & your baby day by day.. which is very neat.. also has a little spot to enter some personal notes, info or thoughts.. it is very small but great to just to jote down something small. It is a nice book.. but...If you want the ultimate pregnancy organizer definately get ""The What to Expect when you are Expecting, Pregnancy Organizer"" I love it. that is the best book anywhere.""The Pregnancy Journal. The Day-to-Day Guide to a Healthy & Happy Pregnancy"" This is a very Nice Companion date book or a great reference to see what is happening day by day.."
3,Only for the extremely enthusiastic mamas-to-be,"sounds odd, I know.I am very happy to be pregnant, and certainly enjoying it. This book is not for me, however. This is not a book that you can turn to for answers to specific questions or fears. Instead, it is intended to be a day-by-day for the happy pregnant gal. This is a great concept, but I got bored with keeping up with the days a few months ago. If you are the type who consistantly keeps a journal or a daily horoscope reader - go for it. If not, forget it."
5,I love this book ;),"This book is so helpful, I love how its a week by week thing. This is my first pregancy and this book is so helpful, and my husband loves me reading each day to find out how our baby is doing. Also I think it would be cute to save this book for when the baby is older and let him read all my notes I put in this book so he can see what he put me thru...I definatly recomend this book to any one especially if its your first child."
4,Great for a first time mom,"I bought this journal for my first pregnancy and was very happy with all the information inside. There are spots to write notes each week and my favorite was the How are you feeling today questions (ie..mood, energy, appetite, morning sickness and cravings). It was also packed full of useful information on the babies development as well as your own in your pregnancy. I recommend this for any first time mom that doesn't have a lot of time to journel but wants to get the basics down while learning about yourself and your baby."
5,Excellent resource!!!,I love this journal. It has excellent information everyday. It tells you what your baby is doing daily. I would recommend this to all moms-to-be.
1,This book hardly qualifies as a journal,"I bought this book on Amazon and after actually looking through the pages decided that it really isn't much of a journal at all. This book has very few places to write anything - I ended up just buying a journal and writing in it weekly about my pregnancy. I wasn't looking for a book that tells me about my pregnancy and how it is progressing (let alone day-by-day) - I already had tons of books on that topic! Anyway - there are much better pregnancy journals out there. I just wish I could suggest one but since I decided to keep my own I can't. Sorry! On the other hand, if you are looking for a great journal for AFTER your baby is born I loved the one I bought - ""Cradle the Thought - A Journal for the New Mother's First Year"". Good luck!"
3,"Good Book, but refers to baby as ""she""","This journal is very helpful, it is pretty much what I was looking for to journal my first pregnancy. I like the day by day updates, and helpful hints. The only thing I do not like is that it always refers to my baby as ""she"". I don't know what sex my child is yet, and this isn't a major issue, but other apps that I have, or other books always refer to the baby as ""your baby"", or ""he or she"". I would recommend this book, I just wish it didn't always refer to my child as a she, since it very well may be a he."
4,Great day-to-day information; not much for journaling,"I love the daily information on the baby's development, but I would have liked more journaling space with some topic ideas for the journaling. Overall, I'm glad I got it though."
2,Dates Are Off,"I didn't like this journal at all. Although it informative, the dates are way off for me. I will try another journal."
1,Disappointed: find book unsympathetic and preachy,"I am in week 10 and the misery of morning sickness and fatigue. I find this book annoying and somewhat guilt inducing. There is never a mention that maybe you aren't feeling great or that at this point you might be in ""survival mode,"" as my midwife put it. Instead, every day it is eat this or that---usually foods like broccoli and kale---things three months ago I would have happily consumed, but now turn my stomach just to consider! The baby info is interesting and nice to have daily, but the mother stuff I find just too preachy and unsympathetic. I wish I'd bought a different journal and stuck with my Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy--at least during this portion of the pregnancy."
2,Not satisfied,The book is too complicated. The dates never matched with my due date and timeline. Was not user friendly and too much text. If I want to buy a book about my pregnancy I would have. Needs to be more like an actual journal because thats what I was looking for. I will not be using this book at all.
3,Fun book but a little annoying,"I love the fact that this is a day by day journal. It's a lot of fun to wake up and find out what's going on with your baby every single day. At times, however, the author really got on my nerves. According to her, it seems the only thing pregnant women should eat are lentils and spinach. While the author never comes out and says it, it definitely feels like she equates a pregnant woman eating chocolate cake with doing crack. Again, a fun read but a little preachy."
5,Excellent,"I am 33 weeks pregnant and received this book as a gift when I was barely two months. It has been wonderful for my husband and I to read about the progress of our baby. I like that I can read daily if I like, or I can save it to read weekly."
5,A great book for myself - a first time mommy!,"This is a great gift for myself! Being pregnant the first time, I am happy to read a day-to-day development journal of my baby inside my tummy. My husband and I enjoy the time we spent together reading it before bedtime. In addition to baby's development, it also offers other tips such as parenting, prevention of back pain etc. It does not have space to write daily - but sufficient space enough for me to write a weekly journal."
5,"LOVED IT SO MUCH, BOUGHT IT FOR SEVERAL FRIENDS!","I thought this book was so amazing, I bought it for many of my friends when they announced that they were accpecting a baby and they also have confessed to picking it up a few times a day.I'm not much of a ""journal writer"" so I was glad that the book isn't meant for just that as the title may suggest. In fact, it's more of a journal that is already written on the progress of the development of the baby."
1,Frustrating!,I found this book so confusing. No matter which way I added up or counting backwards nothing added up or matched what the doctor was telling me about my dates based on my LNMP. I'm throwing it away because I already wrote in it. The idea of it would be AWESOME...if it made any rational sense for calculating.
2,old way of counting,"This book uses the old way to track your pregnancy. It uses 38 weeks instead of 40. There is good info, but its hard to keep track of what week is what."
5,Fun and educational,"I purchased this book when I found out I was pregnant, and each night before bed my husband and my daughter and I would read what was going on with the pregnancy. It was great to know each day what was happening and it was helpful for my husband since this is his first child and he had never dealt with a pregnant woman before. A super book. I reccomend it to all pregnant women and their families."
4,Excellent Buy!!,"I received this journal as a gift within 2 days of finding out that I was pregnant. It gives a day by day growth of your new little one and I found it to be very accurate!The best part is that each day is broken into how the baby is growing and also what the new mommy is feeling, as well.The one drawback is that there is not a lot of space to write anything more than your weight gain and how you are feeling. But with the daily information, it's a definite must-have for expecting parents!!"
5,Love this book,I have one of these books for all 3 of my pregnancies. Full of useful and interesting facts. More info everyday. A fun pregnancy keepsake
4,Great way to pass the time during your pregnancy,"I used this journal for 2 pregnancies in a row, I loved having day specific information on my baby's development. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because often the journal repeated information, such as it would say ""in 5 days your baby is going to delevop it's spine"" and then 5 days later ""around now your baby is developing it's spine."" I guess there are only so many things the baby can be developing and there isn't something new to say every day. However I do still highly recommend this journal. I liked that it has places where you can jot down notes about things going on that week (there is not a spot for every day, although there is room in the margins)."
3,Pregnancy Journal,I used this journal to document my first pregnancy. It had a lot of interesting information about the development stages of the baby in utero. It also had some room for journaling and such but I didn't think there was enough room to write much. I also found some of the journaling prompts repetitive.
5,THE pregnancy book,"It doesnt matter if you are the mother or father to be, this is the book that can guide you and help you find the answers you are looking for.On top of being a wealth of information, it is fun and has a lot of encouraging little hints and tips.If you have this book, you dont need the others that are around."
2,Terrible dates -- decent information,"I love that this is a day by day calendar if you can figure out which week your in. My doctor (and every other calendar)says I'm fourteen weeks, this says I'm in my 11th week. It's frustrating to keep a journal when you don't know where to put your information. If you follow the directions the weeks don't match up. I then tried to put in the dates as I knew they were and it says I'll be delivering 3 weeks earlier than what my OB thinks!!!"
5,Keeps you informed of the changes during pregnancy!,...I have read the Pregnancy Journal and it is a must have for pregnant women! It keeps you informed of the changes you and your baby go through on a daily basis during pregnancy. It is a good idea to have a blank journal for record keeping along side this comprehensive book!
3,"Great book, bad journal","I loved all the information in this book. During the first pregnancy I had a ton of questions, this book helped me to understand what was happening to my baby and my body. But, while there is a ton of information, the part for writing is almost non-existant. To really keep track of all the physical, emotional and spiritual changes happening, you need space...LOTS more than this book can give you. My advice, read it cover to cover, write in another book."
3,"Worth having, but could be better","This is a terrific idea with some neat information, but I wish there was more writing space and fill ins. I enjoyed the information on other cultures and pregnancy but having another pregancy reference is a must since the journal has some questionable advice (i.e. caffeine is ok, etc.) Also, I was very very confused by the numbering of the weeks, which is in neither gestational nor regular pregnancy weeks but rather right in the middle of the two. So I had to go through and redate all my pages once I figured it out.With so few journals on the market, this is worth getting but could be better."
3,"Good info, confusing dates","This is a book full of great info, but it has one major problem. It counts the weeks of your pregnancy from conception. You dr. counts the weeks of pregnancy from your last menstrual period. So when your dr. says you've reached the 12 week mark and are done with the first trimester, this book says your only in week ten. I found this to be irritating. I want to count my weeks of pregnancy the way my dr. does. Other than that, the book is full of useful, detailed info."
2,Not really a journal,"i bought this book from a local bookstore and it was wrapped in plastic, so i didn't get to see what i was buying until i got it home. it has good information, but i wanted something that would let me write (like a journal should) about my feelings and put in pictures of ultrasounds. i'm keeping this b/c like i said it's good info but the title is misleading - it should The Pregnancy Book, not Journal."
5,the only book we used every day,"This book helped my husband and me connect with the baby's development day to day. My husband read it every day and it kept him involved in all the phases of the pregancy. I ordered the First Year Journal after our daughter was born and he is just as glued to that. I especially like the quotes of little bits of wisdom, humor, or just reflectionsat the bottom of the pages."
5,One of my FAVES,"So happy I found this book, so sad I only found it when I was 4 mo pregnant! Details on a day by day basis on what's going on with your baby and your body. So informative. Space to add notes, tidbits, memories. A must have! Also loved the Mayo Guide to pregnancy. I disliked the What to Expect book."
4,"Love it, although could use more space for journaling and info for/about partners","I bought this for my first pregnancy and have really liked it so far. Each day she provides a little bit of information on what is going on with your embryo/fetus and with you. I do wish that (a) there was more space to journal - I ended up writing in the margins and every white space on the page and (b) there was more devoted to and about partners. I realize that not every woman has an involved partner, but a lot of us do, and it would have been nice if things were included for your significant other who is also experiencing the pregnancy (albeit secondhand). My husband used two of the all-page journaling spaces to write to our son. I have put her first year book on my registry list."
2,Don't think the dating is accurate,"I like what this book has to say, but the dating doesn't match up with everything else I have about how far along I am. For example, today I am 10 weeks 4 days pregnant, with 206 days to go. That's the dating that doctors use, which is from my last known menstrual period. In this book, 206 days to go is on 11 weeks 4 days since my last known menstrual period and is considered lunar week 9 day 4 in this book. I am incredibly frustrated trying to match up my pregnancy with this book!"
5,I love this pregnancy journal!,"I love this journal - I bought it for myself, and a girlfriend of mine, since I loved it so much! There is info about the baby every day and space to record your own thoughts and progress - lovely!"
2,"DVD 3078178 doesn't play tracks 5, 6, 7 & 8 - will try to chage it","I received a defective DVD - today I'll try to submit an exchange order, will see if it works...Helene Salim, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"
2,Broken,"My dock came in broken. It was the clear plastic that did not affect the functionality. It also does not stay where i put it. anytime I hit the accelerator or brakes, it moves. The neck is too long as well. Not as good as some docks that I have owned, But for the price ($6.99), I really can't complain too much. Great sound quality. overall I am not impressed though."
2,not as pictured,"i was sent to this item by a griffin technology support tech because the new tuneflex aux would not fit my old style ipod and this older style would. what i got was another new style tuneflex aux. the item received was not the old style (as pictured), but another one exactly like the one i had already bought."
3,"Convenient, but there's a squeal","Just plug and play. I have it in our 2008 Toyota Sienna. However, when playing from my Nano(3G), I have to turn the volume up, much higher than the radio. Which I suppose is the reason I hear the squeal, and it is definitely noticeable when listening to podcasts. It doesn't matter what the volume is on the ipod.I'm thinking of drilling a hole in the ipod cradle in order to directly plug the output into the Aux connection so that I can keep it charging and that should stop the squeal.BTW, it doesn't squeal when I remove it from the charger and just use the aux cable."
5,Excellent Product,After a lengthy search this was the only product I found that would enable me to dock and charge my iPod in my car and plug it into my auxilliary jack without having to pay for the FM transmitter I don't need. I've been using it in my car for about a month and it has performed exactly as advertised with no problems.
4,Flexible is good,"This is great, holds the iPod very well. The only bad thing is that the flexy comes out of the cigarette plug at a funny angle for my car (2007 Jetta). So it took a bit of twisting and rotating to get it positioned so I was happy enough to use it. It didn't end up how I originally envisioned it but it works well where it is and the aux output makes it a simple plug and play to hear my tunes and charge the iPod at the same time."
3,Not so good for older iPod,"The product basically works as billed, but......I have an older Photo iPod, probably the biggest & heaviest made. The stem has a hard time supporting it just where I'd like it, and it is easy to pull or knock it off the stem trying to adjust it (Newer & smaller iPods are held with an additional sleeve, which looks like it would be more secure). Also, the stem is not really long enough to locate it ideally in either of my cars. Try to test drive one on your iPod & your car before buying."
4,Fit my needs well,The TuneFlex fit perfectly into my car and securely holds my 30G iPod in place. I am satisfied with the product and got a great deal on it on Amazon.
1,bad news,"this is the worst sounding answering machine I've ever had or heard...no matter how many times I recorded my message, it sounds like absolute crap...it makes me want to go back to my tape machine...its amazing how poorly a digital machine can sound...i'm going to return this immediately. Don't buy this!"
1,Don't buy it,"The user interface is ridiculously complicated. When you entera password for the mailboxes, it announces each number loudly afteryou entered it, making it difficult to maintain any privacy--why havepasswords at all if everyone nearby can hear your password when youenter it? The sound quality on the recordings is terrible--the firsttime my mother heard my outgoing recording, she said ""What'swrong with your answering machine? It sounds like you're speakingfrom Jupiter!"" Also, after a few months, the screen beganflashing ""lo"", which means the backup battery neededreplacing. Replacing it involves unscrewing a compartment on theunderside of the machine with a mini-screwdriver (why on earth nothave it just pop off like most?). So I put a brand new battery in.Less than a month later, it's flashing ""lo"" again, eventhough there haven't been any power outages, so the battery shouldn'teven have been used!..."
2,Poor Microprocessor implamentation,"I read two reviews when I decided to buy one of these. I think that ifmine had worked, it would have been great. Unfortunately, it hangs upwhile playing the outgoing message. The user interface is very complicated as well. An answering machine that doesn't answer isn't very useful, no matter how many features it has. I'm returning mine."
2,Cheeeezeee B Movie,I really had my hopes up for this one---Hard to follow-thrown together mess. This was more like a rushed trailer.
3,Easy Mosaics,"Just another mosaic book, nothing special, not any really interesting ideas, maybe one project that I will make."
3,There are good tips in this book.,"There are good tips in this book, and it is a great way to get started in mosaics. My only gripe is that the author uses kits instead of making molds. The designs are her own and the instructions are clear and easy to understand. This is an ideal book for those who want to get started and be successful without too much risk."
3,Nice Try but no cigar,"Although the young author appears to have gave it the old college try, it lacked the heart of in-depth, personal research. If you're looking for lists and out of this world shapeshifting assumptions this ones for you.Nothing was in this book I could not have found on the web or made up, in one form or another. I must say I'm glad I did not purchase the book but received it to be reviewed.For a fun little read or to save your search engine this book is for you, just don't expect too much out of it, then you'll be pleased."
3,Shirt,The service was great - got it in time for Christmas. I was a little disappointed in the quality.
1,Works Rather Oddly,"I just received this from Amazon today. It came in a box that was roughly 15"" long and 8"" deep. All this for a little tiny compass. There was one crumpled piece of brown paper in there and of course the compass wasn't inside the paper, it was at the bottom of the box. So, first observation, it was poorly packed.Second, one side of the compass pointer is red and the other white. It seems that if you are facing north or south, you need to look at the red side of the dial for an accurate reading. If you are facing east or west, you'd better read the white side of the dial to know what direction you are really facing. This thing is either defective or crazily designed. Considering how ridiculously it was packed, it's probably damaged. If someone wants me to pay to return it, for a $10 compass, it's not worth it."
4,Engaging and Honest!,"I work in the field that Jacobson writes about, and intended only to skim it out of curiosity. But I soon found myself absorbed in this wonderful tale. It is inspiring but not mushy, truthful but not discouraging. A must-read for anyone who cares about foster kids or is considering foster parenting."
5,The Lord uses Phil,"I have several CDs by Phil Baquie and I love them all. His music inspires and comforts me. I love driving down the road and worshiping the Lord through Phil's music. My kids, 6 & 8, will sing right along and even request Phil by name. Get his CD, you'll see what I mean."
5,Beautiful and practical toys!,"These blocks are absolutely beautiful - they look even better in person! They are well-made and my niece and her parents love them! I have received so many thank you messages and beautiful photos since I sent them the blocks. I got her a set of English and Spanish blocks as her mom is bilingual, and she is already making sounds from both languages. I highly recommend these."
5,Excellent quality,"We bought these blocks for our 9 month old. I am a native Spanish speaker and really appreciate being able to get blocks in Spanish for our baby. So far he prefers to chew on them (and they are resilient), but hope he will soon enjoy building with them. I only wish they came with a box to keep them in while not in use."
2,This block set isn't all tht helpful as far as learning Spanish goes.,"I bought this set of blocks to help children learn Spanish. In all honesty, it is not very helpful. A language school is the best way to go to learn any language."
1,Don't buy for your kindle,You can't adjust the size of fonts to read this book on your kindle. It's pretty much worthless unless you like holding a magnifying glass while reading
2,Awesome album cover.,"2.5 stars.I like finding little diamonds in the rough, and was hoping this was going to be one of them. But..... not so much.This cd is uncomfortably pitched between Dark Indie Rock Priestess and Tuesday Night Women's Coffeehouse Open Mic. It's a little maddening that way, as towards the middle of the record there are some powerful and sonically adventurous tracks, and one wishes for more! Unfortunately, the devil she once knew is not the same devil that Robert Johnson made a deal with, and many of the performances just aren't convincing, the heart is chilled instead of the spine. Opening the album with 3 songs w/ very similar chord progressions probably doesn't help either.Hopefully in the several years since this cd came out this artist has grown beyond this devil, and Tuesday Night, as it were."
3,Pulpy 1st person war story,"Certainly not a classic by any stretch (Helmet for my pillow, Company Commander)... but some evocative imagery of Korean War and some of the relatively unknown battles and skirmishes from this relatively unknown war. Very quick read. Some amusing anecdotes and towards the end some gripping fighting descriptions. Not going to add much to your knowledge of the war itself, but will add a little to your appreciation of the hardship, courage and dedication of the front line soldier."
2,It's just okay,"Not a huge hit. I've noticed the the robot turns off after a few minutes even during use. The program cards are complicated to do, and take several attempt for the robot to accept them. It was okay, but just not a big hit"
1,A waste of time and money,I thought the kids would have fun with these fighting robots. They just did not work well enough to be fun and hold their attention. Probably used for less than an hour total!
2,Too Complicated to Be Fun,"Well, you get what you pay for, and at this price don't expect much. That way you'll be satisfied. These suckers are hard to get up and running and after finally figuring out how they work, they aren't half as fun as you expected. Slow moving, unresponsive controls, and bores children of all ages."
5,Rumble Robots,I got me-fisto. MEfisto the one i got is labelda dymond series.I am the champion in my class.THe farthesive goten to beat somebody is 9 times!i win every battle.I battled a clamster about 10 times or 9 times yesterday and iwon every battle!
2,Don't waiste your money,These are without a doubt the most frustrating toys I've ever seen. You have to scan the cards in the correct sequence every time you turn them on!!! Lose a card and you're out of luck. Too much trouble. Hard to navigate. Slow. Not a good choice.
3,Wire plow rope,"Due to the constant up/down and bending action of your rope when used with a plow, you are much better off using a synthetic plow rope."
2,"Nice idea, but....","Sorry, I side with those critics who thought this was a poor album. The idea, concepts and themes are fine, but musically this record doesn't have the range of it's predecessor ""The Raven"". I'm all for musical experimentation, but this just doesn't do it for me. However, it is interesting for the use of studio effects and techniques, but that's the best I can say."
4,Interesting class study,"My class had to pick books to read for presentations. This one was very well-written & enjoyable, so I picked it. Ortner studies the Weequahic High class of 1958 in terms of their high school position (class officer/egghead/jock/hood), family origin, academic track, racial identity, gender, & class mobility. She consider both class, which is often ignored by non-Marxist scholars, & race & gender, which a lot of Marxists say aren't as important as class. She finds reflections of social movements in the students' fates & tries to keep a balance between ascribing success & failure entirely to either social movements or individual agency. A very interesting book."
3,The book is great. This review is mostly about the Kindle format.,"The kindle format is annoying because everything is italicised. Everything.I have the paperback version and it is not italicised everywhere, only on words that require emphasis... The purpose of italics and bold lettering anyway!Hey Amazon, fix this now!"
3,'twas okay,Had to read for intro to anthro class. Not bad. But not particularly wonderful. It'll seem redundant but it's bearable I suppose
1,Duplicate DVD Workout,"I have been using the Firm for over 10 years. I own almost every DVD they come out with, but I am disappointed in their marketing. This DVD is the exact same at Total Body Lite. Since I already had Total Body Lite which comes with their advanced package I have two of the same workout with two different titles. The workout itself is ok, but I don't like it enough to have two copies."
3,Great for Certain Times,"Great for when you don't want to work up a big sweat, so summer would be the best time to use it. Emily is fun, cute & motivating."
3,Not enough cueing for me,"I am a firm fan and have several videos, but I'm not that impressed with this one. It is designed to be a lighter workout, but I get frustrated because there is not enough cueing and some of the transitions are too fast. Usually after a couple times of doing a workout I have it down. Not so much with this one. I'm sure it will grow on me and besides it was so cheap I couldn't pass it up."
3,Same as Total Body Lite,"This is the same as Total Body Lite. I was lucky enough to read that on here.This really is a lite toning and lite cardio workout. They tell you in the DVD this will not fatigue your muscles and they are right. They say to do this when you are in recovery mode. I thought you weren't suppose to do any muscle lifting when you were recovering.Fine if you only want a LITE workout, otherwise, dont buy this one. It is much easier than other Firms."
3,"Good for an Active ""rest"" day","This is actually Total Body Lite, which is what it should be called instead of Cardio Sculpt Fusion. It isn't a hard workout, but is still good if you are looking for a light way of working out for a day. It doesn't target the arms and the abs as much as I would like, but it is overall a great tape for a beginner or for a light workout."
3,Azna,"I like Sylvia's work -- and even more important, her attitude -- but I find her books more like nuggets of gold than great works of art. Sometimes she recycles stories, sometimes (especially lately) she includes more 'customer comment' than great teachings ... but you know ... there's usually something in there that speaks to me strongly on my greatest need at the time. So it is with MOTHER GOD. This is a handy, succinct little book that I will keep with me so that I can be instantly reminded at any time about the feminine side of the Divine. And why worry if 'true scholars find no convincing evidence of widespread female deity worship'? Does not a child first bond with its mother? Sometimes knowledge isn't wisdom. Sometimes, you have to listen with your heart."
1,boring book,"i am a fan of slyvia's so I've got no axe to grind but this book was boring.... I can't help but let you know about a book I picked up by chance and couldn't put down, it's called PSYCHIC DIARIES BY LYSA MATEU and it is so out of this world compelling and amazing, that after I read it and read Mother God, I felt gypped by Mother God. PSYCHIC DIARIES is compelling and engrossing and fascinating and this is.... not."
4,Mother God by Sylvia Browne,"Interesting. This book has answered some of the questions I have long had about the maleness of God in so many teachings when there are quite definitely two sexes here. Something was always lacking, and Sylvia Browne seems to have filled in some of the cracks with this book."
5,word to your mother,"I love Sylvia Browne and I love our Mother God. I recommend this book to anyone feeling stifled in their spirituality. Don't necessarily knock your existing thoughts out. Just take the best of those, read this book, and make a super-conglomeration of lovin' help. Godblessya!"
2,Not one of her best works,"I expected a more in-depth look at the female aspect of the Godhead, but this book is filled with mostly letters from clients and references to Her in religious history. Her other books like ""Life on the Other Side"" and ""The Other Side and Back"" are better reads since she tells more of her family's, minister's, and her own experiences rather than relying primarily on the words of clients and history books."
3,Spirituality,"Not at all what I expected in a book about the Goddess, who is the Mother of the God. Too much traditional orthodox religion."
5,Great book on the femal God,I love mostly all of Sylvia's books this is one of my favorites by her and I will be reaching for it tonight. Yes it is X-mas and its a hard time for some. I really enjoyed all the advice and information she gave in this book and the Devine feminine without disregarding the Devine Masculine at all. I think she is great and she does admit that she is wrong about some of her predictions she is not always right. I don't think she is out to make a buck with all her writing. She writes a book its up to us to buy and read it and if not you can always take it back. I look forward to more of Sylvia's books.
5,Loved It,I started reading Sylvia's books about a year ago. I didn't even know about her until about 4 years ago when I started taping Montel's show. I have loved every one of her books and I will be buying more as soon as I finish the two I am reading now. This book was very revealing about Mother God (Azna). She tells you everything you wish to know.
4,Very enlightening,"I was left with a very comforted feeling of approachability to the Mother God, which is far better than the ""fear God"" message that too many evangelistic preachers teach. A religion of love, comfort, and help from an unconditionally loving and accepting Father and Mother God - why wouldn't more people want to accept and embrace a religion like that? That is the message that Sylvia brings us. <3"
4,"WTF? You mean God has a wife, or is a woman?","This is not a book for the Fundamental Christian; unless you want to expand your spiritual views and are prepared to be blown away in a religious, eye opening way! For those looking to further expand their views and evolve in the field of spirituality, ""Mother God"" may very well be FOR YOU! This is an awesome perspective at the ""duality"" of God."
3,Fairly Descent,"It works, although the wheels can come off pretty easily, and it is difficult to get the exact amount of track. It seems too loose to me. Overall it will do what you need."
4,good value,"I'm quite happy with the watch. It's much bigger than regular -- looks almost as big as the width of my wrist (granted I have pretty small wrists). The band is really long, too, but has a wide range of adjustment. Feels substantial, and looks quite attractive. The face is curved rather than flat -- I would've liked for it to have the flat surface, but it still looks good. Don't know if the glass will scratch easily due to the shape; only time will tell. Buckle is pretty tight, and has a somewhat cheap feel to it (the rest of the watch is fine). Control is a bit confusing, especially when it comes to resetting the alarm dial or stop watch needles. I was able to figure it out after studying the manual a bit, but I doubt if I'll remember it in a few weeks. Better not lose the manual, I guess. Overall a great value. Would not hesitate to buy it again."
3,like the watch but not the wristband,"This is my second Pulsar watch, and the watch itself is very nice and classy looking. The watch could be a bit bigger, but the diameter of 42mm is OK. Definitely would not want it any smaller. However, I am not impressed by the wrist band of this watch, it scratches very easily, actually makes a squeaky noice when moving around (?), and, after 2 months, one of the pins fell out (which of course caused the whole watch to fall of my wrist!).My other Pulsar watch has a very nice and sturdy wristband, so I don't know what they were thinking here. I still think Pulsar watches are a very good deal, just put some effort into the wristband, how difficult can it be!"
2,used items shipped,"This item was shipped used, the valves had thread seal tape and the package was opened, one of the base screws was broken."
2,Sink okay...but misleading/dishonest photo,"The sink is a good quality sink, but the photo includes a faucet already installed in the sink. Nowhere is there any statement that the sink does not ship with the faucet. I would say the sink is probably worth the price, but I would have chosen another option had I known this one did not come with the pictured sink hardware. To me this borders on dishonesty without an appropriate statement in the description."
2,Too Vauge,"The information is credited. But not usefully for work. The job changes too fast. The streets change even faster. Interesting for the outsider, first year basics. Awww, it was okay at the least."
4,Street Gangs Book,I enjoyed receiving this book. It is full of useful information and a welcome addition to anyone's library who works on the street gang issue.
3,Oh my gosh.....,"I love Led Zeppelin, but not this much.The effort and studious detail is immense, but it was like reading a book about Gettysburg where every platoon, scout, and man was detailed to the privy level.To be fair if you are a musician this book might make more sense. Alot of the detail had to do with music at a level I don't understand. My love of Zeppelin is visceral, so alot of this is lost on me.If you are looking for a book that details the musical side of this band, this is the book for you."
2,The guy doesn't like the band,"With all due respect to the late author, you get the sense that he wrote this book to settle some kind of score. He was in his 20s in the 1970s playing sax in a jazz-rock group you've never heard of, probably cursing Led Zeppelin's success. His constant belittling of the band's work comes off as petty, gratuitous, and bizarre. He really doesn't like the band at all. Why write such a thoroughly researched, seemingly definitive book on a band you disdain? Ultimately, the book's tone of dispassionate history belies a very condescending review, bordering on a cool hatchet job of the group's work that just isn't fitting of the band's standing."
4,excellent history of the band,"This is an excellent history of the band. Not only is it well written but it also goes into extensive details ""behind the music."" It is well sourced, stays away from the ""shock"" stories, and gives excellent information on what the band was feeling as the albums were created. excellent."
2,Zzzzzzz......,"If you're a pretentious windbag who thinks he knows everything and wants to bore people in print, well, Shadwick beat you to it.It's obvious he thinks using lots of verbiage and musical terms nobody cares about makes good reading, but it doesn't. The book is drier than toast and doesn't reveal anything you didn't already know as a big Led Zeppelin fan.Also, why does he think we care about his opinions on the songs? Remain neutral and take yourself out of the book please! And nobody cares about you referecning some obscure bluesman who was ""ripped off"". We get it. It's been said and done ad nauseum.There are way better Zep books out there and while this has some brief good moments and the author does get into all the songs and albums, it's just a painful borefest. Good for insomniacs though..."
4,Practical,"As having taught both as a professional acting instructor and public school teacher, Davies brings practical guidance to the reader who may know nothing about either. Not written to win any style awards, this book is best suited for the parent or teacher who wants to build a group program. It outlines specific exercises and lots of anecdotal information about existing groups."
1,Send me the wrong product too.,"I asked for 1 Recoton T123 3.6 V, 2500 mAh Ni-MH - Panasonic 2.4GHz Cordless Battery.and I got 1 of Recoton T123 3.6 V, 1210 mAh Ni-MH - Panasonic 2.4GHz Cordless Battery.When I sent the item back for refund they deduct shipping for this item though it is their fault to send me the wromg item."
1,Sent me The wrong Product,"I ASKED FOR: 1 Recoton T123 3.6 V, 2500 mAh Ni-MH - Panasonic 2.4GHz Cordless Battery..I GOT: 1 of Recoton T123 3.6 V, 1210 mAh Ni-MH - Panasonic 2.4GHz Cordless BatteryWhats up with that?"
2,BACARRAT HELP?,"This book is far too technical with computer decisions and very little help when i""in the trenches"".The counting required is strenuous and I quit using his system when the deck was player favorable and the cards, in their random mix, failed to produce. a player could handle 2-3 shoes before burnout. The casino edge includes player burnout which causes stupid bets. Thats why the dealers change every 20 or so minutes. I have beaten bacarrat only when I anticipated the unexpected, a tie."
2,Vinyl sweats - it's not for me,IT doesn't breathe and I get all sweaty. I'll never buy vinyl mattress protectors again.
4,good product!,"good product for your mattress! I'm affraid of all kind of insects that could accidentally be brought home from hotels, so I decided to buy this protective cover for my new mattress!"
2,Had seam in the midlde,I got this about a year ago from here for a double sided euro-top mattress. There were seams going down middle of both sides of the protector. I only noticed it on one side for some reason when I first put it on. One seem stared separating just a few moths after getting it. When I purchased it I had no idea that any mattress protectors have seems going down the middle of the lying surface and there was no indication of it in the product descriptions. I had never seen seem on mattress protectors anywhere else than on the side surfaces. It almost makes it worthless in my opinion.
2,Vinyl Mattress,When i put the cover on my mattress it ripped. I have since thrown it out. it was not very durable.
5,Good quality,"True tu it's size, sturdy and well made. Fast shipping. Good product. Queens size weights 3 pounds 2 ounzes."
5,terrific refresher,"I've been using this product for years, and hope they keep making it for many, many more! Earth Therapeutics says it is for feet, but I also find it a perfect substitute for bath powder. I've toted it along on trips to Central America, where it kept me feeling great in the heat and humidity. I won't travel without it. Refreshing, quick drying, talc free, this one's a keeper."
3,Smaller is better?!?,"This ring does look exactly like the picture...but the picture is extremely magnified...I'm keeping the ring because I prefer my jewelry to be really small...if that's not the case for you, then please don't frustrate yourself by buying this ring, it's teeny-tiny. The gold feels a little flimsy.I bought this ring with the plan of having it resized (I wear size 10)...now I'm planning on having it resized & having gold added to the whole back portion to thicken the band, I'm not even sure that can be done...guess I'll be finding out soon!If you do like teeny-tiny, you'll love this ring, it really is beautiful."
1,Sartor Resartus in 100 Words,"In Book 1, the narrator presents to British readers German professor Diogenes Teufelsdrockh and his ""Philosophy of Clothes"". Book 2 describes Teufelsdrockh's childhood, education, first love, heartbreak, sad wanderings, loss and rediscovery of faith. Book 3 expands the philosophy. Only seeing through ""clothes"" (anything - notably rationalism -masking man's true nature as ""spirit"") can we understand life : education & art (flamelike, a spirit grows when kindled by another, not composted) the symbiosis of religion & society, science's limitations.Like the ramblings of a half-mad saint (sweetened by storyline only in Book 2) moments of beauty hide within thick stylistic jungle.Humour (2) Readability (3) Characterisation (4) Structure (4)Beauty (6) Thematic unity (6) Literary style (6) Profundity (7) Significance (7)Rating 50%"
4,CD and BLU RAY in package,The Blu Ray DVD also has a CD along with it-BUT-the CD is missing 'sweet lil' sister' I guess due to disc space-I would rather have them leave off 'simple man' instead on the CD.
1,Stereo only from a blu-ray DVD? Give me a break,"Don't bother with this DVD. You've got 2 audio choices - stereo and stereo. No center or back channels, no woofer, no nothing but L & R front. I can't believe that in this day and age, anyone would put out a regular DVD with only 2 audio channels, let alone a Blu-ray. You want Bad Company thunder, get Merchants of Cool. If I still smoked, I'd use this thing as an ashtray."
1,Total lack of bass HD-MAster Audio 5.0,"As other review says ""there was a distinct total lack of bass"". I put in the title 5.0 because the subwoofer do not works with this bd disc. I do not like a rock concert without the bass sound."
5,WOW,This is a no brainer. CD and DVD. Sound quality is awesome and picture quality is awesome.Paul Rodgers (lead singer and writer) is the classic rock singer and will create goosepimples!
5,A must read!,"What a great book. A very inspiring, easy-to-read, encouraging book. Creston drew me in with his characters. He made them so real. I felt like I knew them. You really care about his characters and can empathize and sympathize with them. I loved this book and is a great book for Christians! Thank you Creston for your talent."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I spent several nights staying up late reading this book. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. I stumbled on this book in our public library and it was an unexpected gem. Now, I will read whatever I can get my hands on that Creston Mapes writes. He writes so well, I forget I am reading as I get pulled into the characters and the story!"
2,Cliffnotes in French?,"It's a pity that Amazon's description of this item isn't more complete--I never would have ordered it. This item is NOT a novel! It is not the original French version of Alexandre Dumas' classic adventure. The closest I can come to describing this book is that it must be the French equivalent of Cliffnotes!The book itself is only about a 130 pages long. The story contained in it is a pathetic paraphrasing of the actual novel, condensed and simplified to make an interesting study guide for the student. I'm not sure how the author hoped to accomplish this, though--the entire story is changed.This book might be of value to someone who only wanted to read something in French. It has notes in the margins to explain words that might be unfamiliar, and is rather easy reading. But if you're looking for anything more than that, you'd be better off taking a trip to Paris yourself and picking up your own copy."
5,Great classic,"How wonderful to be able to read original novels in French. I love Alexandre Dumas. And what a great price to have the 4 volumes of Le comte de Monte Cristo for 0.99c.My only complaint is that I wish Kindle woud make the online dictionary in French available (the cursor only gives you the online english dictionary)and also use a French native for text to speech. I am a French native and cannot understand anything when switching to speech. But, I am sure Kindle will find a way to do it in the future!"
1,Half a Honeymoon? Just the Crust with No Pie?,This is a drastically ABRIDGED edition! Caveat emptor! Buyer beware![Fortunately the amazoo honors its return policy without hesitation. Mine is already on its merry way back.]
4,light and reliable,"I like the reliability of this headphone. It feels a little too light on the ear but it doesn't fall off. I wish the volume went higher. In most environments it is ok but it doesn't go in the ear so that in a noisy environment, it can be difficult to hear and I put an earplug in my other ear when driving my jeep.This would be a ""5"" if the volume went higher or it went in the ear."
2,Another let down,"This blue tooth wireless set is another ordinary headset.It worked fine in the beginning but after a couple of weeks,I hadppl complaining about poor audibility even with the headset fully charged.This is my second headset in 4 months.I will strongly urge you to buy a bluetooth headset that is of the highestquality,even if it is expensive."
3,Decent headset,I purchaced this headset and was pleased until it started to create an echo. So instead of dealing with that I upgraded to the 500 series which I am please so far
4,Great Headset for a low price.,"I original purchased the same headset for my wife and myself through Motorola. We both were very satisfied with the headset so we purchased one for my mother-in-law. Battery life is great, Sound quality is great, easy to use and to set up. Overall a great product. The only down side is that it is not as sleek as other more expensive ones but it's not horribly bad."
4,Not bad for the price,"I got this one about 3 months ago because I had a long work commute. The sound quality is good, but for some reason, I couldn't get used to pressing the buttons while using it. Also, whenever I keep my phone in the pant pocket, there is always some disturbance while walking, couldn't figure out the reason for that. But it works just fine while using it in the car, and I am satisfied with that."
3,Question,I just bought Motorola HS815 Bluetooth Handfree Headset from Amazon.Can I use it for My Sony Ericsson Z520a cell-phone?If I can't use it I plan to return it to Amazon.ThanksR.T.
4,Great price for a good name-brand headset,"I just got this headset earlier this week and so far, so good. I wanted a name-brand headset and was pleased to find a Motorola for $29.99. I've seen this headset on other sites for more than $40. The sound so far has been good- I've been able to hear callers and they can hear me. With the headset being longer, the microphone is closer to your mouth, which may make it easier for people to hear you in noisy environments. It's a longer shape than most other headsets I've seen but it's still very light and comfortable to wear (you can wear it on your right or left ear). All in all, I would recommend this headset if you want to get name-brand quality for a great price."
3,"Convenient, but...","Very convenient to use, but sometimes people have a hard time hearing me if I don't raise my voice, and when its button is pressed in my pocket, my phone automatically redials the last number, which is embarassing. If it had better mic sensitivity and a lock key to prevent the redial from happening, it would be a great headset."
2,"""Could you repeat that? I'm having a hard time hearing you.""","Well, the price seemed right. But little did I suspect that those on the other end would have such a hard time hearing me. It is so bad, it almost feels rude to use it when making calls. Fortunately, the Plantronics Voyager 510 was on sale right after I bought the HS815 and, having seen it's near perfect reviews, decided I'd get it for our other phone and compare. In short: there is no comparison. The Voyager seems of higher quality before you even turn it on. The sound is superior on my end (though the HS815 is satisfactory in this area), and unlike the HS815, those I am speaking with do not know I am using a headset. I'll be looking to buy another Voyager as soon as it goes back on sale. As for the HS815, I should have read the reviews more closely before buying. Not worth the poor performance...at any price."
3,Motorola HS815 Bluetooth Wireless Headset - Black,Everyone always have a hard time hearing me unless I'm talking very loud.
1,SHOPLET cannot Deliver On Time - Even after 2 attempts.,"No problem with the boards, but Shoplet cannot deliver the boards on time; even after they scheduled the time on 2 different occasions. Shoplet said their drivers would call first - that did not happen. Even after giving a 4 hour windows they could get there. They said they would come back that day, they did not. They said they would deliver the next business day. They did not and they did not call until the end of that business day to schedule for the following day. This was purchased by a large company there are plenty of people at our shipping docks, yet they could not make it work. We scheduled people to hang the boards based on their schedule; that cost us. On top of it all they could not even bother with an apology. This is the worst review I have ever written, and I still believe I am being gracious."
5,A WONDERFUL BOOK,"Since I read this book in 1988 I have gone on to read a good majority of the ""classics."" I can honestly say that this little book with its wonderful characters and story plot have stayed with me for all of these years. I re-read the book this week and treasured each page. I did not want the book to end. Beware! If you decide to read this book the characters will remain with you for years. I wish Jennifer Horsman would write a sequel to Passion's Joy! Thank You so much for writing this story. I will probably re-read the book for the rest of my life."
3,Not for my keeper shelf.,"This story is set in the early 1800's with a very active and dangerous underground railroad. Joy is a compassionate person helping every one she can and is very likeable and admirable. The hero Ram And his ""brother"" Sean are manly with vivid personalities and a unique relationship. The story line is very different and has great potentional but it wasn't consistent enough for me. There were parts I loved (the dialogue was great) and parts I disliked (Sean and Ram sound like Viking-Norsmen types). Sorry but I'm just ambivilent about it."
2,"Good book, but I still hated it","I purchased this after reading the raved reviews from here. I must admit that there was absolutely nothing at all wrong with the writing or the pacing of the book. What I found faults with was the heroine. I dread seeing a TSTL, silly girl, pining for the hero who spurns her while he's busy screwing other women around town. This did create many angst moments but mostly I found myself frustrated because the heroine was so (stupidly) innocent and naive about most things.I read 3/4 of the book before putting it aside because I was getting a headache from all the frowning I was doing. So yes, I do agree that ""if"" you don't mind this hero or the heroine, then it could have been a great book, however, I pretty much despised them, hence the low star rating."
3,it works,This is a nice product because of the price.I don't think your going to make a living with this but it does spray paint nicely on my surfoards.
2,as cheap as they come...,"I should have known from the price, the ""product features"" says it comes with a 1/8"" braided hose, NO HOSE CAME WITH IT. The instrution manual is a joke, it did not tell me anything about how to use the air brush or what all the parts are for, and there is no gasket on the bottle tops so they will leak all over if tiped on the side. Next time I will spend a little more for what I hope would be a better product."
5,outstanding,"Dale Henry makes learning fun. Truly an original, he brings the wisdom of Proverbs to life through personal experiences, sometimes quite moving and often hilarious. He is the friendly uncle or older brother whose stories you love to hear, and whose advice you respect. Insightful, never preachy, and a whole lot of fun.Anyone who shies away from this book due to Dale Henry's openly Christian beliefs is doing themselves a huge disservice. These principles are good, right and true whether you are Christian or not, and are well worth the read.Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"
2,Same Old Stuff,"While I have seen Dr. in person and his presentation is good. This book has the same overtone of the self-help diatribe that permeates our society. Dr. Henry has taken his tales of his life and written them out, and then carbon copying a ""verse"" to fit the moment. Stories amusing, yes... but how many times can you write the same thing over and over again. After I had seen Dr. Henry in person, I came to expect more than the usual mass produced ""stuff and fluff"" from the man. Immediate effect - caused me to chuckle occasionally, Long term effect - sell it on amazon and recoup some cost cause one time will do you."
3,Very outdated style but a few ideas,"If you are looking for a little inspiration on your own cardboard creations and this book is cheap, then go ahead and get it. I found a few techniques useful. If you are buying this to make exactly what you see then you are going to have something that looks out of the mid 90s and it is made out of cardboard. Super ugly stuff. The flowers and lights are the only thing I think that even look remotely hip or current."
3,Great product but Amazon web site lacked size information,The Leverlock feature is fabulous and I would like to get it on a pocket size tape measure. Amazon's site did not give the size of this tape measure which turns out to be too large for the pocket so I got the wrong product. I'm keeping it because I can't find the pocket size anywhere (Stanley used to make them).
1,Nickel Free .925 Sterling Silver Band Peridot Cubic Zirconia Ring Size 9,"This was a Christmas gift that my 16 son got for his girlfriend. 2 stones fell out in the first few days. Now we are going out today to check out Walmart, Kohls or Meijer to see if we can try again!"
3,"Patience,Princess Catherine",this could very easily be great book but drags. The author never really gets to the great part until the very end!!!!! Good book hough.
5,Fits my 17in wide screen laptop,"I have an HP wide screen that fits snugly in this case. It has plenty of side compartments for all your junk.. I mean accessories. The two piece handle is a little odd at first but it goes together just right and supports the bag well. Lots of zippers, that also means lots of noise. It does rattle a bit from the metal zipper thingys."
5,itscraigp,Mr 3star F. Kahn below is an idiot!This bag is an Amazing Value! Quality is very good. There are better (Like my Coach Bag) but they cost a lot more! ($450)
4,HP Executive Leather Briefcase,"Looks good. Meets my needs. Leather is very soft, and could scratch or mar, but with a little care this should not be a problem. The case has plenty of mesh pockets to hold accessories."
5,Perfect,"Works great for my 17inch laptop, it is snug and takes a little time to remove at the airport but i still would buy it again, shipping and packing was fine.."
4,"Incomplete ""set"" of Alphabet Letters","These tiles are advertised as a ""set"" of: 88 capitals and 88 lower case. I got 3 lower case m's, but no capital M's. I got two capital P's, and Q's, but no lower case p's or q's. There were no capital I's. I called the company and they sent me a replacement. They were very easy to deal with. The one inch by one inch tiles are made of lightweight plastic, not heavy like Scrabble tiles, but sturdy enough."
4,Phonics Tiles Upper and Lower Case letters,My kindergarteners love these. They use them in one of our Literacy Work Stations to spell C-V-C words and for putting beginning letters on pictures.
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"Although they are VERY well made, they just aren't what I was looking for - although they are exactly as they said. As we used them I realized I would have liked to have ordered something different."
5,Perfect!,Using these for my preschool special education classroom. They're easy to handle and easy to identify which makes the literacy tasks more fun!
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this product. The tiles themselves are nice. They work well for my daughter to spell words with. However, we only received a few of some letters (like 2 or 3 of some letters) and a lot of other letters."
5,Just what I wanted,"These arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I am excited to use these with my son as he learns his letters and to read. I may put magnets on the back, but I haven't decided for sure."
4,Helps with spelling,"I bought this to help my son learn his spelling words, and it is very useful for the purpose. But I wish they came on a tray to store them in alphabetical order and right side up, instead of mixed up in a tub. Having to sort them each time is an inconvenience. But the product itself is useful and durable."
4,Pretty good stuff,"This book, which is loosely based upon a real event in the USSR, has a unique setting and characters. Once it got going, it reminded me of a good Stephen King book that wouldn't stop until the last page! I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a non-traditional story with a lot of suspense!"
3,A Good All-Round Photography Book,"This is a good general book on photography. Although all of the photographs are black & white, there is not much content specific to black & white photography other than a brief discussion of film, filters, and developing and printing techniques. The majority of the book deals with exposure and light, composition and subjects."
4,Art of Black and White Photography,Well written book. Recommended book for someone wishing to learn the art of black and white photography.
2,one in the package of 2 was defective,"I haven't installed yet, but on one level in the package, I discovered that there is a piece of loose plastic in the track that the metal ball travels in, this causes the ball to stick and not move at all.Perfect case of Quality control missed it, but then WTF do you expect it was made in China.Now I have to contact Camco and try to get a warranty replacement, or just go buy something locally as they are pretty cheap and probally not worth the hastle to get replacement.Other than that if you install them correctly with screws and not the stick on backing they will be fine and ""Precise Enough"" for most applications."
1,junk product,"These are absolute junk. I ordered two sets. One package a level was missing the ball and the other package one level had a burr inside that wouldn't let it work right. Also they are noisy they are not glycol filled just air, so the ball rattles around. I was going to use them on a machine to help set rough grade will get filled gauges instead. A product I would suggest is a digital angle meter level."
1,BAD BAD BAD,They will indicate the correct angle if your the Titanic just before it went under the waves but outside of that its junk. They will be un-glued and replace with something much better. Dont waste your %%%%%%%%%.
3,not what I expected but ok,This works with a little metal ball in it instead of air in a liquid. Not sure that makes a difference in function or not. I should have read the description better.
3,Not very good levels for an RV,I purchased these for the front and side of our travel trailer and hoped they would help level the RV. The ball bearings do not move very well as the level changes and you must tap them to get them to position themselves properly. I would not buy them again.
1,SUCK,DON'T BUY THESE. YOU COULD SLEEP ON A HILLSIDE AND THEY WOULD SAY YOU ARE LEVEL.AFTER THE FIRST OUTING I RETURNED AND BOUGHT THE GREEN LEVELS WITH A BUBBLE I HAVEN'T INSTALLED YET BUT KNOW THEY WILL WORK BETTER.THESE ARE A WASTE OF TIME
4,Not a bubble level,"this level is fine for the price. It is NOT a bubble level in liquid. It is a small ball in the plastic tube. Works good for what it is but it is not all that accurate. For accuracy, get a liquid level with bubble."
3,Much smaller than expected.,"Thought I could mount one on the front of the trailer and see it as I backed in, but they are only about 2"" wide. Otherwise, they are fine."
3,I was there,"This film had particular interest to me because I was in Key West when this film was being made and I even stayed at the same motel where the film crew was staying. If you are familiar with Key West and Captain Tony (a real person), this flick may appeal to you. Unfortunately, the big loggerhead, I have foregotten what his name was, definitely the best actor in the movie passed away some years ago. Captain Cisco - Bradenton, Fl"
3,Okay,It's quite dated but interesting. I watched it to gain more insight on Key West before visiting. It supposed to be based on true story.
3,Older Book,"This book contained many true things about campus however, it's an older edition and many things are not true or even around anymore. It's really not worth the purchase anymore."
2,A bit of a letdown...,"For the most part I enjoyed the first two books, and was looking foward to how everything would tie together, but only one the the three subplots was really completed. Sorry, but if it's going to be continued in another series, then don't call it a trilogy. The story of who is behind things at the Fatherhouse is built up but never finished. The same goes to a lesser extent on the bomber of New York. Oh well..."
3,Description is confusing?,Is the description correct? 3 disks with only 216 minutes? Also $44.99 for only 216 minutes?
4,barbara,"some former corrie actresses , sherrie hewson and the ledgendary Jean Alexander, who has not lost a bit of her comic timing,from her Days as Hilda Ogden, steal the show, some very funny episodes, Bill the husband is very witty,everyone but the son are funny, the sons a flake,and sillybest eps ""Queenie"" (with Jean Alexander)""fox"" (hillarious) and ""the christening"" are stand out"
1,I CHOKED ON THIS TRASH!!,"I was babysitting my bratty sister and her snotty nosed friend. They fell asleep and I was bored so I read this book. Absolute garbage! Why would anyone - even my bratty sister - want to waste time and money on this boring nonsense? GOD! You might as well play ""twinkle twinkle little star"" by burping. It's just as entertaining."
2,Great until you have to remove it from a windshield,"I'll echo the other, but add some details. It worked and removed great from the pad mounted to my dash. It would even go on and off a windshield if not left on long. But when mounted to a windshield for a longer time, it ripped apart coming off and now does not work. Like another review, my radar detector has ""cheap"" little suction cups with no problems.I work in industry where nitrile rubber, viton, and other materials are chosen on their ability to withstand heat and UV rays. Either Garmin selected this material in total ignorance (not good) or with full knowledge it would fail this way (worse yet)."
1,Suction cup doesn't,"Am replacing this unit with one from ProClip at $60. The Garmin Suction Cup mount is not reliable. Even after repeated cleaning of suction cup and mounting plate, the suction cup will break loose from the base plate, sometimes without the Garmin Unit even attached."
1,This thing Melted to my windshield in 84 degree March weather,I received the Garmin Nuvi 360 for christmas and this mount came with the new GPS device. It worked great in the cold weather but during a warm Ohio March day of 84 degrees I went to remove the Mount for placing it in another car and the entire suction cup was melted onto my windshield. The device now does not work at all and I have this black nasty rubber stuff glued to my window. Not sure how to remove it and I am seriously upset.
1,"Original design is defective, RMA yourself a new one (free if still under warranty)","I called Garmin tech support yesterday (10/17), did wait about 15 minutes to speak to someone. I called in the morning so it wasn't a long wait. Since my nuvi is still under warranty (1 year warranty) I requested a RMA for a replacement suction cup mount. The tech asked how it had failed -- mine also had melted to the windshield so I had to rip it off -- and responded like he was very familiar with the problem. He also mentioned the rubber material of the original design was defective and that they had a new rubber material design and would send me a new one. I didn't have to pay for it and should get here in 7-10 days."
2,Glued on - remove whenever not in use or else...,"The bracket works great, holds the GPS in lots of positions, BUT it WILL GLUE ITSELF to the windshield if left on in a hot car too long, as others have pointed out, too. This is really too bad, because the thing is not cheap to have to replace for no other reason."
1,Get the Bean bag mount instead!!!,"I have had many problems with this suction cup mount, and I now have the bean bag mount. The bean bag mount is 1000 times better!! We absolutely love it and you will too."
1,Just junk,Looking for a replacement to the OEM now. What a piece of junk. Pops off - no matter what you do - and when the miracle happened it did stick - it was because the rubber melted to the window on a not-so-hot day.
4,Suction Cup Mount Works Great,"Garmin suction cup mount is excellent, it came with my Garmin Nuvi, haven't had any problems mounting it. It does leave a ring on the window, which gives away to others you may have a GPS. I haven't had problems using it in extreme cold or hot weather."
3,Mostly good,"The basic Garmin product is very good (Nuvi 350), however the windshield mounting suction cup fails repeatedly when the summer sun falls directly on it - a situation that cannot always be avoided. You come back to the car to find the GPS unit on the dashboard or on the floor. In such cases, a bit of the surface of the suction cup remains on the windshield, so that the next attempts to use it are of increasingly shorter duration.The new suction cup holds better than the old, but I suspect that with age it will also fail. It would seem to me that the cup needs to be deeper - the present one is very shallow. A SMALL amount of glycerine on JUST THE RIM of the cup seems to help. The use of the metalic windshield mounting disk seems to help only minimally.The service of the supplier used by Amazon for the replacement part was exceptional, and should be commended."
1,Disappointed - Broke on First Use,"I was excited about having a windshield mounting for my Garmin again. I hooked it to my windshield. A couple of mornings later, I got in my car and noticed the Garmin navigation unit was on the floor and the suction part on the windshield. It did not even last 24 hours. The rubber had ripped from the weight of my little Nuvi350 navigation. The original mounting unit that looked just like the one I bought on Amazon lasted 5 years. This one lasted two days. I am going to attempt to return the unit for replacement this weekend, since this one was obviously defective."
1,falls off and can fall under the brake or gas pedal,"this gets a 1 star because i can't give it no stars. it doesn't hold. it worked fine for the first month, but now i can drive about 10 miles before it falls off. i live in california, so no extremes of temperature. i drive on paved roads, but there's not even any potholes to blame. i use the black disc that it came with, but that hasn't held a bit. the suction mount randomly lets go and then everything just falls. the nuvi detaches from the suction mount, and the two pieces fall randomly in my car. i am still trying to use it but don't think i will try much longer. it's actually dangerous, bc sometimes it falls on the driver side and now i think about it it could actually easily fall under the brake or gas pedal..."
4,Garmin Replacement Mount,This product seems identical with the Garmin mount and is half the price.Need I say more ???
1,This thing broke in three days,"I got same mount with my GPS unit. The mount broke in 3 days. Now I must hold the GPS or put it on passenger seat (if no passenger) and just listen to the instructions.I don't like the design. It has the extra middle unit that does nothing more but made this thing hard to use. It can be made much simpler. Why not a simple mount without the extra middle unit? You can already plug the charger to GPS power slot! Why the extra step and extra unit? This is just a waste of materials without adding additional value.I really need a mount to use the GPS. However, if I order this one and spend another $20, I would have no confidence on the new one. It may break in 3 days, or have other problems as described by the reviewers.And how about the hassle of returning a $20 thing and going through the laborious warrantee process? That was the reason I visited this accessory item. Well, after seeing all reviews, I would rather keep my $20 and save myself from some more disappointment."
3,"Disappointing, but what are you going to do?","It blows that you have to buy the whole mount because Garmin won't make a suction cup separately. Sure, I understand a lot of companies do this, but by now they must know that their suction cup sucks royally. The least they can do is sell the cup separate since they don't want to make a quality cup. Still, it's probably better than the old one."
2,Garmon Suction doesn't work,The suction cup on this item doesn't seem to want to stay on to any glass. I would suggest looking for another option to mount your unit in your vehicle.
1,item does not fit what it says it does,I ordered this for a nuvi 770 garmin and it was advertised as being for it but it does not come close to fitting the 770. Not happy about this.
3,Garmin Suction Cup mounting for Nuvi GPS,"This is a very good product and performs well once you know how to mount and dismount the Nuvi GPS unit. The Mount does not come with instructions for removing the Nuvi and in trying to disassemble our original unit, we managed to break the mounting bracket. This required purchasing a replacement Mount."
3,"Good design, weak construction","Garmin makes a great GPS receiver. The design for their mount is excellent but the construction is weak. This product suffers from two major flaws. First of all, the pedestal is way too short. On my car, you have to mount the unit either right below the mirror or on the left of the steering wheel if you need to access the unit. Unless you have the arm length of NBA player, it is impossible to access the GPS when mounted in the center of the windshield. Secondly, the suction cup gets weak after few months of use. I have used Arkon windshield mount for my PDA for years and it is still functional."
1,Garmin Suction Mount Poor design,"Don't purchase if you ever plan to move the mount! As it will with normal sun heat self-glue to windshield and seperate (peel) off. You's need a razor to scrap remaining residue off windshield. Or if it comes off cleanly warping will not allow a clean seal to windshield and you will end up catching the falling device in traffic from the floor board. I wrapped the pwr cord around the rearview to prevent this while the approx 30min suction held. Buying replacements cups from Nuvi are non-existant. They will only sell you a whole unit for $30.00, that works out to be $30 x every 3mths = $120yr. of aggravation. On the plus side the actual unit is a gem."
2,You'll need more than one!,"After reading Bill from New Jersey's posting, I tried for several days to get Garmin on the phone -- all with no success! I waited and waited on hold, and -- on four occasions -- I was essentially told that since they ""were experiencing unusually high volume of calls,"" I needed to call back and then I was disconnected. On another occasion, I admittedly gave up after over an hour on hold. Having spent almost a thousand on the Nuvi and having the first suction mount become unusable after a half dozen moves in three months, I broke down and bought three more mounts so that I could have one in each car. I'd think long and hard before I bought another Garmin product, however!"
5,Suction cup plus...,"For all of you out there sticking this suction cup directly on to your windshields... Did you notice the black disc with the red adhesive? THAT'S what's supposed to go onto the windshield. Then the suction cup goes on to THAT. Result: NO problems, even in the hottest weather."
2,Garmin Suction Cup,I received the wrong Suction Cup mount and I have already returned it. I am still waiting for them to get back to me. Once I receive the right product I will give them a review. Best Wishes....MohanIt is more than 3 months after I returned the product but I have not received the product or my money back. Very disappointed. This is totally unprofessional.
1,unhappy customer,"The product was not what I wanted. Since I had to open the package to discover that it was the wrong device, the seller would not take it back. I'm very unhappy with the experience. The seller was very unhelpful and unfriendly when I called."
1,just like the others say...,"don't bother with this. As mentioned before, the rubber from the cup melted onto the windshield. It took forever for me to get the darn thing off the windshield. After getting it off, I still had to used a razor blade to get the rest of the black rubber off the glass. And there is still a slight black circle there. This happened in April in Michigan.I will admit, before it melted, the location and flexibilty of the mount was great."
1,"Same problem as others, sticks to glass...then won't stick","I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest ""advantage"" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it).What this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in. The mount and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a ""portable"" system!"
2,Shouldn't be Necessary!,"It's a real shame that one has to go out and buy these suction cups after spending several hundred dollars on the Nuvi. Yet, the cubs quickly become fused to the windshield (no matter what season), and if removed often, they quickly lose their stick. Thus, if you want to move the Nuvi between cars (the only advantage over having a built-in GPS system), then you must buy extra cups for each car. I found Garmin impossible to contact!"
4,Great product and transaction!,A great find at a great price! Had to replace my broken mount and this fit the bill. Great product. Seller was excellent with shipping.
3,Garmin Suction Cup Mount for Nuvi 350,This is my third suction cup mount for my Nuvi 350. The first one that came with the product for quite awhile. I never removed the suction cup mount from the window and the sun and heat melted the rubber suction cup and it deteriorated. My wife has a Nuvi 340 and the same thing happened to her suction cup. I ordered a couple more.The second one broke at the hinge after about 8 months of use. My wife's is still working fine.I ordered a couple more. I have been using the new one for several months now and just returned from a trip where I used it in a rental car. No problems so far.
1,I got enough of this thing!,"Ok, after getting yet another bruise on my knee after my Nuvi fallin down, I went online and ordered a dashboard friction mount. This Garmin Suction Cup that came with my Nuvi 350 works fine most of the time (90%?) if you put it properly. But when it falls it falls and this is not you want to be into when you are on the road.I got it falling many times in 2.5 years but I was reluctant to replace it because I felt that I just did not put it carefully enough on the windshield. But I believe that any kind of a car gps mount should be fool proof to begin with and this thing is not, which is not acceptable when one's security is at stake."
3,Garmin suction cup mount,The weak link in this mount is the flexible joint that permits adjusting the position of the Nuvi series up and down. The wall thickness of the plastic housing that encases the metal pins is way too thin and it doesn't take much to break out the plastic portion of the joint in sub-zero cold temps like we experience here if far western new York state. Thus my original mount broke out and I had to replace it with this one. Other than that failure I'd say it was a five star.
3,Solution for melted suction cup.,This is a good mount. My suction cup melted too. I called Garmin at 800-800-1020 and they mailed me a new one.
3,It didn't fit our product,I was looking for the stem but this didn't fit the original mount that came with the older Garmin product. It will function as designed. It just didn't fit what I was looking for.
4,Exactly what I needed,Got exactly what I ordred. I was concerned that the ball & joint was exteremely tight - I thought it might break..But that is not seller's fault. Thanks for the speedy delivry
3,Watch what you order.,We bought this to put in my vehicle. The suction cup part worked but the mounting brakcet does not fit our Nuvi. Be careful when you order to make sure that you have the product nubmers correct. Very nice item to have for travel.
4,Ooh Lula,"Marcelo D2, a Brazilian hip hop and samba artist, was my undeniable highlight of the first North Sea Jazz Festival held in Rotterdam, in July 2006. With his band, including multiple percussionists and dancers, all with their sexy Brazilian attitude, he blew the roof off the Congo tent.This cd, recorded a few years before the extraordinary performance in Rotterdam, did not quite meet my expectations - sky high after the concert - but is nonetheless worth buying.Classics are Vai Vendo, Qual É and A Maldicao Do Samba. If you have the chance, check out Marcelo D2 live."
5,looking for the perfect bear marcelo d2,"I thought the cd was good. I liked it a lot, even though i'm not good at speaking portuguese yet. The cd had a good rhythm and flow and I found it enjoyable.."
1,Didn't appreciate some of the discussions,"I purchased this book when we were expecting the birth of our first child. I wanted something to compliment the ""what to expect"" book. I found the author's discussion on subjects like circumcision and other matters a bit harsh, if not scary. I stopped reading it about a third of the way through w/no desire to finish."
5,starting a life of learning,"Dr. Greene includes some amazing research on the rapidly developing capabilities and learning power of the unborn baby. Prospective parents learn how to give baby the best start, all in an engaging conversational style. We love this book and recommend it strongly."
5,Shocking expose of families who control America,"Domhoff crears away the mystery of why the real power, political and economic does not filter down to the common people. His documenting of the families who make sure that their interests are met is both shocking and clear. If you read it wrong, you can come to the conclusion that we the people, can do nothing. I read it as a call to action to obtain power and influence for we commoners."
2,Indefensible,"Richard A. Posner is the most cited academic and lower court judge in history. However, the arguments proferred in this text are simply not worthy of the ink used and the trees killed in the process.Deeply disappointing."
4,As far as I'm concerned the whole matter is settled,"This book, while a difficult read, lays out the Constitutional arguments for the legitimacy of the Supreme Court's decisions in the presidential election of 2000. I didn't vote for Bush, and I won't vote for him in November, but after reading this book, I can accept that his presidency, while controversial, is legitimate. (Opposition to Bush's policies is a separate matter entirely, and I won't be sorry if he loses.)"
2,A Big Miss By a Great Thinker,"I have read every book by Posner and loved and learned from them all -- until this one. The central argument of this book is that if the Supreme Court had not stepped in, the country could have been thrown into a long and interminable political deadlock. Posner even jokes that Lawrence Summers could have become President for a short time. The problem with this argument is that we do not live in a banana republic. Even if the process had been extended and eventually decided by Congress, the country would have survived quite easily. The Court's reasoning was poor (even Posner admits that). More importantly, it was decided by Conservatives who espouse the ideal of leaving decisions to the States. It was one of the worst decisions by the Court."
3,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, Posner ultimately ends up relying on the same intellectual dishonesty in trying to justify the Supreme Court's decision that at least three of the justices used in crafting the opinion. Left unaddressed is the most disturbing of Dershowitz's observation that these same three (Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas, and probably others) completely ignored their overall ""judicial philosophies"" (as contained in their previous opinions) to install ""their"" man in the White House. It isn't the judicial activism that is the problem. Had these justices been consistent with what they SAID they believed in, the decision would have at least been defensible. As it stands, the decision is justifiable only as a raw exercise of Machiavellian rationale. THAT is the tragedy."
1,A Waste of Time,"Richard A. Posner's book, Breaking the Deadlock, could have been more appropriately titled ""Stretching the Imagination"". I had expected so much more in reading this book, like a solid arguement for the Republican point-of-view. While Dershowitz and even Bugliosi give solid legal arguements in their books, Posner just rambles on and on trying to stretch the limits of his creative imagination to justify what many in the United States see as treason."
4,Tunedok for Ipod,"The item is similar to the other tunedoks that belkin makes for the other model ipods. it comes with an assortment of fitments and i had to try different combinations of the supplied items to get it to stay firm in my cupholder. The actual ipod holder is clear plastic and holds the ipod by the corners on the bottom. there is an open space at the bottom of the plastic holder to allow a charger or fm tuner access to your ipod. All in all, it was a great deal and came extremely fast when i bought it through Office Depot. The only thing that i don't like about the holder is that it was designed so to fit a naked ipod. it would not fit with a nano skin on it so if you decide to buy this, make sure you buy a case that allows easy removal."
1,Needs modification to work,"Good concept just terrible design, whoever designed this product obviously did not use it. The output jack won't fit the connector because plastic covers the hole. You have to drill out plastic on one side and shave connector to make it fit, I should have just sent back but figured too much of a hassle. Search for another company I have had problems with Belkin before."
2,sly old fox,"He is a master, no doubt, but also a master in selfmarketing and keeping secrets.Lots of theory and philosophy but little in practice. Kind of a teaser for his classes. So if you are an Ervin fan buy it. I'll sell it."
5,Awesome book,This is really a great book. Well written with lots of crazy stories and little quotes.
5,An outstanding book by a great author.,After having read Legacy I had all of my beliefs about the Great Walter Annenberg confirmed. This man is truely a great and magnanimous individual. His donations are really unprecedented and you could say he has done more for education than any other American. I truely love this man. As an alum of the Peddie school I was astounded by his massive gift in 1993 and I do hope his actions will inspire other alumni to make similiar or even larger gifts.
2,Is This A Joke!?,"DO not be fooled! This video hits collection has really no extra footage of anything that no Blondie fan has not already seen! The picture quality is no better! You are better off buying Blondie's Greatest Video Hits Collection than anything else! I even thought the sound quality to Heart of Glass was actually bad compared to that of the Greatest Video Hits Collection. The only thing that I really liked about this video collection was the way they re-did the Tide is High video. Other than that, don't waste your money even at the very low price! I would recommend to any Blondie fan to buy or stick with their Greatest Video Hits Collection."
4,It's like seeing old friends,"It's nice to see some clips from Blondie, the best of the new wave bands from the late 70's and early 80's. Blondie was a pioneer in music videos in the days before MTV. Most of the videos in this compilation are simply shots of the group performing, and the rest are certainly crude and uninspired by today's standards. But it is a hoot seeing Deborah Harry and the boys in action, and hearing classics like ""Heart of Glass"" and ""The Tide Is High"". The DVD is very short, not much more than thirty minutes. But it's a lot of fun nonetheless and a must for fans of that bygone era."
3,The Catholic Church & The Extreme Right.,"This is an interesting and thought-provoking book,but its findings should come as no surprise to anyone.The history of the Catholic Church in the twentieth century is one of alliance with the extreme right:not just,as shown here with the extreme right in France,but with Hitler in Germany,Mussolini in Italy,Franco in Spain and Salazar in Portugal.After the war,the Vatican was at the centre of the terrible practice of helping Nazi war criminals escape to South America,and they in turn helped to prop up fascist regimes there.This book shows that the Catholic Church has much to answer for in France,but also much to answer for everyewhere."
3,Sweeter than sweet,"Dark doesn't always mean semi-or bitter- sweet. I'm a bittersweet chocolate lover. Given that, this little discs were way to sweet for me.That said: these wee bits melt beautifully, smooth as silk.Dr. Barb M"
5,How can you go wrong with Merckens?,"Great product, delicious on its own, melted or added to other flavors in candy making. Use it ALL the time."
4,The roman humour,"This is one of the typical Carlo Verdone's roles: the clumsy umprepared one who tries to cheat other people in order to get what he wants, but he does it in a such funny way that is impossible not to laugh! He's great when he mimes the innocent one and tries to behave as a very cultured priest in front of a demanding woman who's asking about the book he should have written! This is at the base of the Roman comic spirit, from where a lot of other Italian actors took their inspiration."
2,Hard to play,this toy's buttons are to hard to push even for an adult. Doubt if a small child could use it. Need sound.
4,A blockbuster of a book,"This is an exciting tale of the head of the New York Record and how he uses terrorism and espionage to exceed the circulation of the New York Times. This book is full of the stuff summer blockbuster's are made of. Lot's of exotic locals, beautiful women, and violence"
5,Mr. Wallace really gives you the felling of presence,"I've read this book and he really places you into the novel. He as well describes how one of the characters seduces a woman, so exciting. This is an excellent book that demonstrate a side of POWER."
5,Previous reviews are outdated!,The previous 3 reviews were written before the release of this new edition. Still the best single book to read for the oral Boards. All clinicians should own a copy and refer to it often.
2,Why this used to be a good book.,"As an attending/assistant professor of anesthesiology I frequently recommend books for residents to read. I still recommend this book, but with the caveat that much of the information is outdated and some of it is no longer even held to be fact. The underlying theme of the book - that comorbid states influence anesthesia and vice versa - is still true. I tell residents to get a used copy or wait until a new edition comes out."
2,Nothing but coal,"Could've been cool. Could've been great. But this Christmas album is something I hate.First, the musicians involved -- none are listed in the liner notes or their website, and I can understand why, but Jim Curtiss at least had the gumption to take credit as project coordinator -- didn't give the music any oomph. Instead, they (identified covertly as Santa Claws & the Naughty but Nice Orchestra) took the familiar melodies of ""You Shook Me All Night Long,"" ""Back in Black,"" ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"" and ""Highway to Hell,"" among others, and watered them down to something even elevators would be ashamed to play. Then, to give them that special Christmas cheer, they added sleigh bells in the background. Yep, that's it. That's the big secret behind this daring recording.Whoop-de-flippin'-doo.This album commits the ultimate musical sin of being dull and uninteresting. Perry Como rocks harder than this.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editor"
3,Only for AC/DC fans,This was a gift for a true AC/DC fan who I have known for years. For him it's fine but the music is played too mellow. Of course it's for Christmas but it is very strange and I expect people who buy this item to listen sparingly during the holiday season.
1,You gotta be kidding!,"The book is very poorly written. It consists of outdated information that is written without regard for producing a worthwhile product. You can be reading and in the middle of a page the font changes probably from some attempt to update. It seems that the only reason this book was written was to make money, not for you but for the author. I gave it one star because I could not give it a zero. Save your money do not buy this book."
4,A great beginner's guide to bookselling.,"Those who are born to work hard and reap the benefits, this is for you. Those who would rather sit on the sidelines and expect a miracle to happen, don't bother. The home based bookstore is a great tool for beginners in the business by offering some tips and hints that you may not think of off hand, such as what kind of books are in demand, where to come across large quantities of books for a great price, how to use your cell phone to look up the price of a used book online instantly, and so on. Do not expect to be making a ton of money soon, but by working hard with cunning and persistence, you will become your own boss. This is a very quick easy read (I read the whole thing through in a few hours) that will inspire you. However, some of the information was out of date, and I wish that some subjects were discussed in more detail (there seemed to be no automation software tools for macintosh users, for example)."
5,Steve's book really delivers!,"I purchased this book and found it extremely helpful in getting started selling books on Amazon. The book is to the point (no fluff) and contains helpful information to get a new seller up and running. After I began to sell, I referred back to the portions of the book I had highlighted to refresh my memory and to make sure I was covering all the bases. I highly recommend it!"
2,The Home-Based Bookstore,"Book needs more nitty gritty details. Too much generality. I was especially distressed with the fact that the author doesn't delve nearly enough into specific titles, etc. Find a mentor and save your $19.00."
4,Good Reference for Beginning Booksellers,"The Home-Based Bookstore is a good introduction to online bookselling. However, needs more detail and could do a better job of guiding beginning booksellers through the maze of online bookselling. I realize, however, that it's hard to keep up-to-date in this fast moving market. I especially enjoyed the chapters on where to find books and how to price them. The chapter on Where to Sell Books was too short and probably overly optimistic. Doesn't mention such mega booksellers as betterworldbooks, that seem poised to undercut all sellers and how individual booksellers can compete against non-profit booksellers who rely on donated (aka ""free"") books to sell. All in all, however, I would recommend this book for anyone thinking of getting into online bookselling."
3,o.k.,"If you have been selling on Amazon and think that this book will help you sell more, it won't. You probably already know what this man has to say. On the other hand if you are new to the ""biz"", you will love it and it will help you."
5,Good Hints and Down-to-Earth Information,"I highly recommend this book for anyone with a home-based book business with Amazon or any other on-line store. The ideas are right on and elementary. Yet, if you already have a business, the information and web sites he gives in the book are valuable."
5,Great Book for the Beginner,"This book gave me great insite into what to do and where to go to get the books that I need to start up my own home base book store. I am just a beginner and really needed the help, but for the novice person, this book probably won't reveal anything that they don't already know. Great Book for the Beginner"
4,Very Pleased,"The book arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I'm very pleased with the experience. I haven't had a chance to try it out, but it's written in plain, easy to understand language. Especially, for a novice who has never sold anything online."
5,"The Home-Based Bookstore: Start Your Own Business Selling Used Books on Amazon, eBay or Your Own Web Site","This is a great book, I found it easy to read and extremely informative, and even though this book is a bit dated (2003) everything still applies, just with today's prices, economy etc...The author left no information out and gave lots of research options for the people who want to go further in their quest. Really good reading!"
5,Full of useful information without the fluff,Don't let the small size of the book fool you. There is no wasted space. It is full of highly useful/practical information from cover to cover!I recently planned to start selling books part-time. I thought selling books would only take a little common sense. I've learned so much in just the first chapters (and had many errors in thinking corrected). I suggest reading it with a highlighter in hand.
5,Pure substance. High quality information from a pro who is not afraid to share his secrets,"Steve Weber points out in his book that selling books online is ""hard work."" In that spirit he writes this book. The book does not contain get-rich-quick promises. Instead it offers useful, realistic information about selling online. I for one am very glad I bought this book - a book that, actually, I read in one sitting."
3,Opening a bookstore,Tips that make perfect sense. I will follow his tips to collect more books to sell. You should try this book.
3,André,"Nice book, it helps a lot - teaches you the ins and outs of setting up a second hand bookshop! Had the local economy been more friendly to those selling and buying second hand books I'd've made better use of the tips thereof!!"
4,selling books,"This book is worth every dime. A great information source, it can save you a lot of research time."
1,Major Printing Problems,"The typeface switches back and forth from one paragraph to the next. Much of the information is outdated, common knowledge. There is what appears to be a huge chunk of text missing on page 46, incomplete sentences, several typefaces, two different topics in one paragraph-- makes no sense. Book may be okay for someone with no knowledge of online selling or books (someone living under a rock the last 20 years, perhaps?) but not a serious seller. I won't even include in my listings of used books, because even though it's brand new, it is not the high quality book I am willing to put my name behind."
5,Excellent Resource For Book Sellers,"I wish I had this book when I started out selling books back in 2005. I know this book would have saved me a lot of time and money. After selling books online for four years I totally agree with the author that fiction titles by famous authors are not good sellers and it's best to find a niche market for the types of books that interest you.The book is well written in a very clear style. Thanks for writing this book, Mr. Weber!"
5,Shhhh! Let's Keep This Book A Secret!,"You would have to spend months reading bookselling discussion boards and websites, and devote years to online bookselling to learn what author Steve Weber teaches about selling used books online in The Home-Based Bookstore. It should first be mentioned that Weber has only been selling books since 2001. But in that short time, he has sold more than ""one million dollars of used books."" Which certainly makes his own worth reading! Weber's book includes the usual book business how-to's: Buying, cleaning, listing, and selling books. But, unlike other books on the subject, he has generously included information about wholesale book distributors and used book sources--sources most sellers probably hadn't considered. In addition, he also provides a link to his blog. (As if he hasn't already shared enough information!) In short, Weber's book is so informative, that as an online seller of used books, I hope my competition doesn't read it!"
4,Hot remixes!,"This remix CD his hot. If you're into collecting remixes or you like Rent (or if you're a DJ) then this Maxi Single is for you! Gomi's Lair Club is the best version because it uses 90% of the original song and it sound really nice. My only complaint is that it starts off kinda boring. Monkey Bars Club Mix has a bangin' beat behind it. L.E.X. Theatrical cub is pretty good. The worse on the album is Eddie Baez's 'Payin' the Rent' Club Mix because all is does is uses Tracie Toms' part over and over and over and over agian! Also, the beat is annoying.Overall, I say go get it. It's pretty good."
4,"""525,600 MINUTES""",This is a cool single. Not only is the album version great but the dance mixes are pretty good too. I only gave it a four stars because I wasn't that impressed with the remixes but they are good enough to recommend. It's something different........CHECK IT OUT!!!
2,Good while it lasted,"I got my DR220 about four years ago and it was a WORKHORSE for about a year.Then it started acting up... would turn off in the middle of use; I thought it was a switch problem (easy fix; right?).WRONG...something about the motor shifting causing lose of contact.At first, I had to quickly shift the direction of drill to get it to work; later, a quick tap on the side; then a sharp whack against the wall.I just bought a cheap $20 drill.I can afford several of them for what I paid for this DR220:{ jmg"
1,revisionist dribble!,"What a self-serving pile of s**t! This book should be listed under ""fiction"" or at least ""history as Burch would like to think it was!"" As a police officer who dealt with Miller and her ilk in the months leading up to the night of August 12 1992, and who was at Chancellor Tien's home that night, I can tell you that Burch's account of these events is nothing but a transparent attempt at revisionist dribble. She blames everyone except the one who was personally responsible for her own actions. Save your money!"
4,No complaints,"I can't complain about the product I recieved. It Wasn't chrome, but it serves it's purpose. Life is tought enough without me making yours harder. Mainly, it does what I need it to do. I woulden't hesitate to shop at galaxy agian.I prefer the closed buckle, but it has been deemed a security risk, so I needed the open face buckle."
3,disappointing,I was hoping that this movie would have the great action/adventure/comedy that was present in the original Slayers TV show and Slayers Next.This is somewhere between one of the Naga shows and Slayers Try. In other words its silly slapstick comedy with none of the real heroic adventure aspects of Slayers. In my opinion Slayers Try wasn't as good as Next or the original and the Naga episodes are way below it.And it doesn't have Lisa Ortiz as Lina. The other voice actress just does carry off Lina's psychotic joie de vivre.It does have a mildly interesting interview with the guy who voice acts Zelgadis.
3,Must Have for Slayers Fans Only,"There is a total of about 30 mins of animation in this anime, but it featured Lina, Gourry, Amelia, Xellos with a cameo from Naga. A logical consequence of this is that there is really no story.Animation wise, this anime is decent. CGI is used but not well integrated. (If you can tell CGI is used, then it is not well integrated.) Character designs are pleasant, but different from earlier Slayers animes. For example, in the less than 2 minutes of Naga footage, her two talents are greater than ever.This is the last Slayers anime made. The cast of Slayers bid a fond farewell to their fans. Of course, unless you are a Slayers fan, the farewell means nothing. So, 5 stars if you are a Slayers fan, 1 star if you are not."
2,Not That Great,"I was really disappointed with Premium: I loved the three seasons, and bought this DVD because it featured the orginal characters. However, most of the English voice actors were not the same. The stylistic change in the art wasn't that big a deal, good or bad for me. The additional interview with the original voice of Zel, Crispin Freeman, was actually more entertaining than the feature itself."
4,Menacing drone,"About 5 minutes into the 25-minute-long or so second track, there is a really intense meltdown that reminds me of Guru Guru at their very best (they were at their very best only once, however) and of the good, nonboring parts of Jimmy Page's Lucifer Rising soundtrack.Other than that, it's passable stuff, especially if you like hearing German frauleins speaking in their native language (which, of course, sounds like the barking of orders, no matter what they're really saying)."
2,Cheaply made MP3/USB Car Stereo,"It has no anti-skip memory. Both normal and MP3 CDs skip. The USB port doesn't recognize there's anything plugged into it most of the time. I've tried several different flash drives. USB playback is choppy if your mp3s are high quality (320Kbps). If they're lower quality than that, it will play fine. There are no next/previous folder buttons. Navigating an mp3 CD with just next/previous track and the +/- 10 tracks buttons is annoying. With a normal CD, it will remember where you left off and resume next time you turn the car on. With MP3 CDs, it starts over from the beginning every time. It is not worth the retail price of over $200. I am happy with it because I only paid $60 for the unit and installed it myself."
5,so good I bought a second one,"This has nice variable power so you don't over power something, but enough for when you need it. I like it better than some I paid three times as much for. Can't say how it would do in commercial use, but great around the house."
1,SilconeZone set in Green,I purchased the SiliconeZone Set of Two Ice Trays (Green)Product Advertised Features:Quick and Even Cooling - Should say Very Slow and Uneven CoolingFlexible - Should say so flexible you will have difficulty gettin a filled tray into the freezer without spilling water everywhere.Easy Removal of Ice - Should say you have to use your finger to push out each piece of ice. Twisting does not free up and remove the ice.If you want a real challenge making ice then this is the ideal product for you!
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I have had these for months and love them. They hold up really well, make perfect ice CUBES, that's right real, actual cubes, EVERY time. They have stood up to regular use with no real signs of wear and tear that I can see. I like them way better than regular ice trays and don't even have one anymore."
1,Really NOT the Chinese Way,"The title of this book is highly misleading. The author displays a deep misunderstanding of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) philosophy by combining it with Western medicine and other alternative therapies. For instance, vaccinations and synthetic supplaments are completely at odds with TCM principles, and no true TCM practitioner will ever recommend them. The nutritional advice of diet consisting of more than 70% carbohydrate not only does not reflect the Chinese diet, but will certainly lead to obesity, diabetes and related illnesses. The Chinese prize pork and other animal fats, yet the author seems to pander to the fat-phobic public and advocates low fat in most of the dietary advice. Although there are good explanations of TCM principles at the start of the book, the author is yet another in the string of Western doctors showing lack of faith/knowledge in TCM by combining it with contradictory Western therapies. I do not recommend it."
3,not as good as we hoped,"It is very stiff, and I was looking for something softer. Also it has an annoying squeaker in it"
4,Freedom and Struggle,"What's a nomenclature consultant? Whitehead's latest focuses on an un-named character hired to re-name a town called Winthrop. Apex Hides the Hurt is inventive, original and addictive. Subplots include an injured toe and Apex multicultural band-aids - they really do hide the hurt."
2,no tension at all,"I found this book oddly lacking in tension. Not all books have to have tension, but I got the feeling that this book was supposed to. The main character (whose name we never learn) is supposed to decide between two factions in a small town that have different ideas about how or whether to rename the town. The tension between these two opposing parties should be at the heart of this book, but I just couldn't bring myself to care (possibly because the alternative to the town's current name is just silly). The lack of tension is especially ironic when you consider the name of the town that the main character finally decides on, which I think is supposed to summarize the overall theme of the book: Struggle."
2,Unreliable,"Bought mine from a local retailer -- seemed great at first, but spontaneously drops traffic every so often for no reasons what so ever. The ports literally die and I am forced to power cycle it various times in order to get it working again -- or alternatively keep repairing the connection in windows.I first thought it was a Vista problem, but it died for all my computers once. Maybe I got a lemon?"
1,Worked for less than 12 hrs,The switch worked for less than 12 hours. It worked great right out of the box. Then in the morning it tried to get online and nothing. All that happens now is the power light blinks. I spent 45 minutes talking to someone who made it apparent that they knew very little about the product and was going off a checklist. Very frustrating I will not buy another and hope I never have to talk to their tech support again. I would have given it a zero if I was allowed to.
4,DGS-2208 - Good solution for inexpensive gigabit,"The D-Link DGS-2208 is a good solution for upgrading to inexpensive to gigabit capability. Requires that NICs be gigabit capable to take advantage of increased bandwidth, otherwise the switched connections will remain at legacy 100 megabit bandwidths."
4,Quick and easy upgrade,"I purchased two of these to replace aging 100 Mbps Linksys switches. I literally unplugged the cables from the old switch and plugged them into the new switch. Now I can copy and backup very large files/sets of files in a reasonable amount of time. These switches look good, are totally silent (no fans) and claim to have some power saving benefit but I can't vouch for that. I would have given another star but since I've only had them in use for three weeks I'm not certain what their longevity will be. BTW, after rebates, I paid about $35 each for the two I purchased. They're a quick and easy upgrade that I would recommend."
4,I just works.,It's an un-managed switch. I plugged it in. It worked.That's all I can ask. No problems of any kind.
5,EXCELLENT switch,"Very easy setup, just plug in the network cables and power it up, DONE!Fast too. Highly recommended."
4,If only there were a mini-rack,"I have four of these to replace older D-Links and they couldn't be easier to install. The reduction in heat (and power savings) are wonderful as well. Obviously, they are much smarter than the prior generation, which allows them to turn off circuits not in use.The only complaint I have as a SOHO user is that d-Link needs to come up with a simple rack or bracket assembly to get them to sit neatly together. The footprint is so small and the weight so light that the force of the cables on the back keeps them from sitting neatly on my shelf.Very fine product for the money."
4,Great Down-n-Dirty Gig-Ethernet,"Works as advertised. For a home, non-managed gigabit switch, it gets the job done. Transfer rates between mutually gigabit devices was about where it should be.Great value for the money."
2,Worked for about a year,This router died suddenly and all the lights went out after a year. I unplugged it and let it sit a while and started back up and work for about two minutes before shutting down completely again. I've had other routers from Netgear that have lasted for many years and still running. This unit was well protected with a high and UPS and when it went out we had not had any electrical problems or any other issues. So not very sure about the long-term robustness of this router
